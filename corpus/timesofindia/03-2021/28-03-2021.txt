---||Gurgaon||Intimate get-togethers, private parties: Gurgaon ditches grand Holi plans amid the pandemic||On Wednesday, the Haryana government banned public celebrations of Holi this year due to the rising COVID-19 cases in the state. Over the last week, the state has been regularly reporting over 800 new cases every day. The order, days before the festival, did force few revellers to change their grand Holi plans but largely, Gurgaon residents say that they would have gone for muted Holi celebrations this year anyway. Most people say that due to the rising cases and as a mark of respect to the people who lost their lives in the pandemic, their Holi celebrations will either be just symbolic or negligible. Shatakshi Agarwal, a DLF Phase 3 resident, says, “It has been a difficult year for everyone with so many people losing their lives to COVID and many others suffering financial strain due to it. I don’t see how one can celebrate after that. That’s why I have decided not to celebrate Holi beyond just applying gulaal to my family at home. We need to respect the virus and the fact that it is still spreading and have sober celebrations this year.” Others argue that a Holi celebration – even if small – is necessary to symbolise that 2021 will be a different year, full of hope. Vijendra Rawat, a Sector 56 resident, says, “Of course, grand celebrations make no sense but we should not do away from celebrating Holi altogether. The vaccine is here and things are looking up this year. I think celebrating Holi will symbolise hope. Of course, we need to keep in mind social distancing and take necessary precautions. We are doing just that – two families, getting together and celebrating, taking all necessary precautions." Most celebrations in Gurgaon this Holi are small and private. Hardly any public celebrations had been planned and any that were, have been cancelled since the state government’s order. Vibha Mathur, member of the RWA of a group of apartments in Sector 50, tells us, “We used to have a huge rain dance party on Holi in the society every year. But like last year, we have decided to suspend that this year as well. There will be no community lunch either.” Other societies are trying to get the residents together, albeit virtually. Rakesh Sharma, a resident of MG Road, says, “Our RWA has decided to have no celebration on Holi this year. We are just organising a children’s colouring competition on the festival but that is to be done by kids at home. No physical events are taking place.” Many RWAs in the Millennium City are still holding a Holika Dahan puja on Sunday night, but there too, the attendance is limited to one person per household (or even per block or building in bigger societies) in order to ensure social distancing and less crowd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/intimate-get-togethers-private-parties-gurgaon-ditches-grand-holi-plans-amid-the-pandemic/articleshow/81725620.cms||Abhimanyu Mathur
---||India||Delhi, Dhaka ink 5 agreements; Hasina pushes for Teesta pact||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina followed up the bonhomie and goodwill exuded on Bangladesh’s National Day with a bilateral meeting Saturday that saw the two countries signing five agreements in areas ranging from sports and disaster management to trade remedial measures. A Modi-Hasina “tete-a-tete” preceded the formal talks. The meeting though again saw Hasina emphasising the need to sign the interim Teesta water-sharing pact which West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee continues to oppose vehemently. The two sides also discussed issues related to the Rohingya with India saying it was happy to facilitate “safe, speedy and sustainable” return of the forcibly displaced people from Myanmar’s Rakhine state. "PM Sheikh Hasina did refer to the Teesta issue. PM Modi reiterated India’s sincere and continued effort to conclude the agreement in consultation with relevant stakeholders," said foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, adding that the Indian side also requested Bangladesh for early finalisation of the draft of the interim agreement for sharing of Feni river water. The results of the West Bengal election could have a direct bearing on the Teesta pact. “She (Hasina) underscored that to alleviate the sufferings and save the livelihoods of millions of people dependent on the Teesta river basin, it is necessary that Bangladesh receives its fair share of the Teesta waters, the draft agreement of which has already been agreed upon by both governments in January 2011," said a joint statement. The delay in signing the Teesta agreement remains one of the few thorny issues in bilateral ties. Hasina had also raised the issue with Modi in their virtual summit last year in December. Showing no sign of softening her position, Mamata Banerjee said earlier this month that her state can share water only if it had enough for itself. On security cooperation, recognising terrorism remains a threat to global peace and security, both sides reiterated their strong commitment to eliminating terrorism in “all its forms and manifestations’’. Modi expressed India’s appreciation for the cooperation extended by Bangladesh on security issues. The two leaders inaugurated three border “haats”, laid the foundation stone for five packages out of a total eight of Rooppur Power Evacuation Project and also jointly inaugurated Rabindra Bhawan facilities in Kuthibari, said the joint statement. India also gifted 109 ambulances to Bangladesh. Significantly, while Bangladesh thanked India for gifting 3.2 million Covid-19 vaccine doses, it also requested India to facilitate regular delivery of the remaining tranches of vaccine procured by Bangladesh from the Serum Institute of India. On the Rohingya issue, Modi expressed appreciation at the generosity of Bangladesh in sheltering and providing humanitarian assistance to the 1.1 million forcibly displaced persons from Myanmar’s Rakhine state, said the joint statement. Hasina requested India to play a strong role in the early repatriation of the displaced Rohingya back to Myanmar. India assured its “continued support" in this regard. On connectivity, Hasina offered the use of Chattogram and Sylhet International Airport by the people of northeast India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-dhaka-ink-5-agreements-hasina-pushes-for-teesta-pact/articleshow/81728807.cms||Sachin Parashar

---||---||Phase 1 of polls kicks off: 80% voting in Bengal, 77% in Assam||WEST BENGAL: Bengal’s tribal heartland and Assam’s tea and traditional Assamese bastion got off the poll blocks on Saturday with a turnout of 80% and 77%, respectively, amid sporadic violence involving Trinamool and BJP in election epicentre East Midnapore and BJP-Congress in two constituencies of the northeastern state. Of the 30 seats in Bengal that went to polls in the first of eight phases, the spotlight was firmly on the seven East Midnapore constituencies where CM Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool and her turncoat former aide Suvendu Adhikari’s family are, for the first time, fighting an election standing on opposite sides. The windshield of a car ferrying Soumendu Adhikari, the brother of BJP’s Nandigram candidate Suvendu, was allegedly smashed by Trinamool workers at Sabajput, barely 8km from the family’s Shanti Kunj home in Contai town. The brick attack, which occurred around 11am and left Soumendu’s driver Ram Singh injured, reflected the continuing bitterness between Trinamool and the Adhikaris in East Midnapore. Neither Soumendu nor his father Sisir Adhikari, TMC’s Contai MP who crossed over to BJP recently, made much of the clashes. There were a few other incidents — crude bombs being hurled at Pataspur to intimidate voters and voting being suspended at Majhna, around 4km from Contai town, for an hour following allegations of malfunctioning EVMs. Complaints and counter-complaints were lodged by both sides with the Election Commission over polling in the district. The violence, however, did not deter women voters — particularly Muslims — from coming out in large numbers and pushing the polling percentage to above 80%, something that Trinamool and BJP polling agents noted with contrasting emotions. If the number of red flags in Khejuri was any indication, the Left Front, too, appeared to be in the fight in some pockets. Khejuri and Pataspur had played a key role in the 2007 farmland stir that culminated in the Nandigram police firing that claimed 14 lives. In Assam, the cumulative voting percentage across the 47 constituencies is likely to exceed the tentative figure of 77%, the state's chief electoral officer Nitin Khade said. These 47 seats with an electorate of 81 lakh voters, including CM Sarbananda Sonowal’s Majuli constituency, had registered a polling percentage of over 85% in the 2016 assembly polls that brought BJP to office in the state for the first time. Barring minor glitches in EVMs at a few polling stations and clashes between Congress and BJP supporters at Samaguri in Nagaon and Jonai in Dhemaji district, voting was by and large disruption-free. Besides CM Sonowal, the prominent candidates whose electoral fate is now sealed in the EVMs include state Congress president Ripun Bora (Gohpur), outgoing assembly speaker Hitendra Nath Goswami (Jorhat), AGP president Atul Bora (Bokakhat), jailed Raijor Dal chief Akhil Gogoi (Sivasagar) and Assam Jatiya Parishad president Lurinjyoti Gogoi (Duliajan and Naharkatia). Minister and BJP's star campaigner Himanta Biswa Sarma said NDA would win “42 to 43 seats” out of those that went to polls in the first of three phases.

---||Mumbai||‘Heard Mansukh Hiran talking about Sachin Waze pressure to own up’||MUMBAI: A hotelier and a constable have reportedly told the NIA that they heard businessman Mansukh Hiran murmuring to himself about police officer Sachin Waze’s demand to him to own up responsibility for the car explosives case. On March 3, a day before Hiran’s murder, three police inspectors, a senior cop and Waze tried convincing him to admit he had parked the vehicle laden with explosives near Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25. Sources said the meeting happened at Waze’s office at the city police headquarters. NIA is probing the car explosives case and the subsequent murder of vehicle owner Hiran, whose body was found in Mumbra creek on March 5. The meeting happened behind closed doors between 4.30 pm and 6.30 pm, but the hotelier who had come to hand over ‘hafta collection’ claimed that Hiran, who stepped out of the meeting, was muttering to himself about the unreasonable demand when he had done nothing wrong. A constable also heard this, sources said. The hotelier also claimed Hiran kept walking in and out of the meeting room. The hotelier, who is likely to be a witness, told NIA that Hiran was firm on his decision not to own up to the crime, but Waze kept insisting he should give it a second thought. “In between, Waze ordered a sandwich and tea. Then a senior officer arrived and Hiran was again called inside Waze’s cabin. Hiran was upset, confused and started murmuring to himself as to why he should take responsibility when he had done nothing wrong. A police constable who was sitting there has corroborated this with the NIA official,” a source said. Meanwhile, the ATS which has submitted the interrogation report of convicted constable Vinayak Shinde, has asked NIA to ask L&T to preserve the CCTV footage of the Freeway, Mulund toll naka and other places where images of Waze and his accomplices were captured. “It is a crucial piece of evidence and after a certain period of time, the old data will be overwritten,” an officer said. Citing progress in probe, NIA had submitted that they have recovered number plates and five vehicles including high-end end ones allegedly used by Waze in the crimes. NIA has also summoned the two doctors who had conducted the postmortem on Hiran as there are discrepancies. NIA also submitted that Rs 5.73 lakh, along with a note counting machine and clothes worn by the accused, were recovered. NIA, during hearing on extension of Waze’s custody on March 25, said voice samples of Waze have been sent to FSL along with clips where the accused is seen moving in suspicious manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/heard-hiran-talking-about-waze-pressure-to-own-up/articleshow/81729318.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Patna||Bihar: As Covid spreads tentacles, doctors advise caution||PATNA: With fresh Covid-19 cases spreading their tentacles in the state, doctors have advised revellers to exercise caution on Holi and avoid public gatherings. Laying emphasis on four safety protocols — wearing mask, using sanitizer, following social distancing norms and washing hands frequently — Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumar Singh says people should adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour during the festive season. “Throwing caution to the wind will increase the number of Covid cases exponentially,” she warns. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, also urges people to hold subdued Holi celebrations. He says, “Maintaining social distancing is mandatory for all, but people above the age of 50 years are at a higher risk of getting infected with Covid.” Suggesting a way to stay safe amid the pandemic, ENT specialist Dr Ravi Shankar points out, “Since the virus usually enters one’s body through the mouth and the nose, one should not smear colours and ‘gulal’ on people’s faces.” General physician Dr Diwakar Tejaswi advises revellers to play Holi in an open space and shun crowded places. Many Patnaites are also planning to keep Holi a low-key affair due to the fear of contracting the virus. Homemaker Sushma Singh says, “I have strictly told my children to play Holi in the house and not meet friends.” While Punaichak resident Anamika Roy will celebrate Holi at home, Rajbanshi Nagar resident Sanjay Singh will not invite guests this year. Meanwhile, the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) has once again urged city residents not to offer items made of plastic to the community bonfire on Holika Dahan on Sunday. “Burn anything made of plastic, rubber or leather will lead to air pollution,” says BSPCB chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/as-covid-spreads-tentacles-doctors-advise-caution/articleshow/81727867.cms||---

Even for Holika Dahan and Shab-e-Baraat, people have been directed not to gather in large numbers and follow all Covid-19 protocols. These instructions came on a day the state recorded 195 new cases and two official deaths.

These 195 new cases were against 59,031 samples tested and compared to the past two days there has been a slight reduction in positivity rate. As per the data shared by the state health department, the state's tally has now reached 26,4604 and there are 1,114 active cases in Bihar. Covid-19 positive cases on Saturday were reported from across 33 districts. Patna reported 80 new cases, while other districts had less than 10 cases. Even both the deaths reported were from Patna, after which the state’s toll has reached 1571.

SP (rural) Kantesh Kumar Mishra on Saturday said the arrested woman lawyer was identified as Pratima Kumari (41). “Her male colleague is Sunil Kumar Goswami (48). He is also a lawyer. They practice at Patna City sub-divisional court. The two have an affair for a long time,” he said. Mishra said two contract killers – Vimlesh Kumar alias Chotan (25) and Nikhil Kumar Pandey – were also arrested. Amrendra was travelling on a bike from his residence at Jakariapur in Ramkrishna Nagar to Daniyawan for paying Rs 4 lakh to a person from whom he had purchased a land worth around Rs 50 lakh. Pratima, who has a 17-year-old daughter, had lodged an FIR against unknown criminals in connection with her husband’s killing. The SP said Pramita had fixed the murder deal at Rs 4 lakh and paid 50,000 in advance to the two killers. Fatuha SDPO Rajesh Kumar Manjhi said Sunil is also married and has a 23-year-old daughter. Five cellphones and a bike used by the shooters in the crime were also seized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-lawyer-held-for-role-in-hubbys-murder/articleshow/81727760.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Bihar: ‘Sincerity of girls reason for better performance in Inter exam’||PATNA: Girls once again outshone boys in the Intermediate examinations, the results of which were declared by the Bihar School Examination Board on Friday. They topped in all the three streams — arts, science and commerce — and scored a better pass percentage than boys. But have you ever wondered what enables girls carve a niche for themselves in academics year after year? Academics attribute girls’ better performance to their sincerity, hard work and concentration. They utilise time in a better way and pursue their studies more seriously. “Girls are aware and empowered as a result of which they are performing better than boys in every field,” Sheo Sagar Prasad, a senior psychology teacher at Patna College, told this newspaper. Quoting a study conducted by the UNESCO, Prasad pointed out that boys read less fluently because of “lack of engagement”. “Poor reading habits have cost the boys dear,” he added. According to Magadh Mahila College principal Shashi Sharma, girls have a better attention span and fare well in exams. Sometimes when they do not perform up to the mark, a lot of parents encourage them to do better. “Moreover, there has been a significant progress in improving girls’ access to education in recent years. With growing awareness about their rights, they are becoming more career-oriented and self-dependent,” Sharma said. On the contrary, Kameshwar Jha, vice-chairman of the Bihar State Higher Education Council, observed that the growing penetration of internet into the lives of youngsters, especially boys, had adversely affected their performance. “Researchers have found that boys spend more time in the virtual world, playing online games, on a daily basis. However, parents are to be blamed for their state because they willingly buy the latest electronic gadgets for them,” Jha said and added that the phenomenal rise of girls’ enrolment in secondary schools this year had proved that they were breaking the glass ceiling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sincerity-of-girls-reason-for-better-performance-in-inter-exam/articleshow/81727926.cms||B K Mishra

---||Surat||nCov cases triple within a week in Bharuch, Narmada||Bharuch/ Surat: The second wave of Covid-19 has gripped the industrial district — Bharuch and neighbouring Narmada, which is home to world’s tallest statue — the Statue of Unity (SoU). Going by the official data, the total number of Covid-19 cases in Bharuch has now reached 3,969 of which 173 cases are active. Even as the official death toll stands at 32, more than 500 people have been created at Covid-19 special crematorium till Saturday. According to officials, death due to comorbidity is not considered as death due to Covid-19. In view of the sudden spike, the district administration has advised industrial units to strictly implement the Covid-19 SOPs. Large number of employees working with industries in Dahej, Ankleshwar, Jhagadia and Ankleshwar are also affected with Covid-19 as the cases are rapidly rising. Earlier, there were ten Covid-19 designated hospitals in Bharuch district. These included six private hospitals and four run with government support. Currently, however, there are seven Covid-19 designated hospitals including six private hospitals and Bharuch civil hospital. Sources said, the situation for those seeking hospitalisation is worsening as there is shortage of Covid-19 beds in hospitals in Bharuch and neighbouring Ankleshwar.

---||Kolkata||No playing with colour, muted events in Salt Lake, New Town||Kolkata: Keeping in mind the rise in Covid cases, most of the block committees in Salt Lake have decided not to play Holi with abir or liquid colour and are scaling down the celebrations by not organizing the customary cultural evenings. “Considering the present Covid situation, we have decided not to celebrate Holi this time. No cultural programme will be organized either. Let us refrain from celebrations this year and remain safe so that we can doubly celebrate the next time,” said Raja Banik of AK Block Residents’ Association. “We are not organizing any cultural event this time. We cannot ask people not to celebrate Holi, but they themselves are very much aware and will not be playing with abir or liquid colour,” said an FD Block committee member. “There will only be the usual adda where everybody can come wearing masks. The cultural programme in the evening that we were planning has been rescheduled and will be held in a small way with a baul performance and dinner on Monday instead of Sunday,” said a member of AE Block Samaj Kalyan Sangha. “The way Covid cases are rising is alarming. We are not organizing any Holi programme this time,”said Partha Sarathi Mitra, secretary of IB Block Welfare Association. Assistant secretary of CK-CL Block Residents’ Association Dipankar Mitra said, “We will organize a ‘prabhat pheri’ in the morning and ‘Holika Dahan’ in the evening, but the events will be small-scale and all Covid protocols will be strictly followed.” In New Town, Hidco will be organizing Basanta Utsav at Rabindra Tirtha, but the event has been rescheduled towards the evening and residents are being urged to watch the programme online. “Like every year, Basanta Utsav will be celebrated at Rabindra Tirtha, but there will be no playing with colours. People are being requested to watch the programme live online,” Hidco officials said. “We are urging everybody not to play with colours keeping in mind the rise in Covid cases again,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town Forum and News, a local NGO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-playing-with-colour-muted-events-in-salt-lake-new-town/articleshow/81728341.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||Case rise may hit non-Covid admissions, operations: Kolkata private hospitals||KOLKATA: A surge in the number of Covid patients may lead to a corresponding reduction in the number of non-Covid admissions across Kolkata’s private hospitals. The hospitals — which have been instructed by the state health department to expand their Covid units in the wake of the case spike — fear that planned surgeries and treatment could be badly affected like last year when non-Covid units had to be drastically squeezed. Bed reallocation, some private hospitals said, could alter the patient profile over the next four-six weeks. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), which currently has 40 Covid beds with an occupancy of 17, had converted a part of the floor into a non-Covid unit that now caters exclusively to health-scheme patients, including Swasthya Sathi. “There is now a possibility that this 65-bed unit will be reconverted and merged with the Covid unit,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. Peerless Hospital, which has a single 48-bed Covid unit with an occupancy of 22, has scaled up its non-Covid capacity to 300 from less than 100 over the last four months. If Covid admissions touch 48, there could be a corresponding reduction in one of the non-Covid units, according to Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. “If we have to set up another Covid unit, non-Covid admissions will be affected. The more Covid patients we take, the more non-Covid patients we must refuse,” he said. He added that planned surgeries, that had been deferred last year due to the pandemic, are still happening. “It would be a setback for those who are still waiting to get their surgeries done,” Mitra said. Belle Vue Clinic plans to increase Covid beds to 23. “We may have to reduce our non-Covid beds like we did last year if the Covid unit has to be expanded. This will lead to a reduction in the number of Swasthya Sathi patients and planned admissions,” said Belle Vue CEO P Tondon. AMRI Hospitals added 12 ITU beds to its existing 55 Covid beds at its Dhakuria unit on Saturday. With less than 50% occupancy, the authorities don’t see an immediate expansion. “But it is a possibility and we will stop admitting Swasthya Sathi patients in that case. Other non-Covid admissions, too, will drop,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/case-rise-may-hit-non-cov-admissions-ops-pvt-hosps/articleshow/81728331.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Allahabad||Atulya Ganga mission team in city after grand Ganga Parikrama||Prayagraj: The team of Atulya Ganga—an organisation formed by Army veterans, who have taken upon themselves to clean the river Ganga, reached Prayagraj after undertaking a historic and grand Ganga Parikrama of 3,000 km in 100 days, on Saturday. After the darshan of 'Maa Ganga', the soldiers conceptualised Mundmal Ganga Parikrama as the main objective of the Incredible Ganga mission. Parikrama team leader and former military engineer Gopal Sharma said that the love of the citizens situated on the banks of the Ganga was doubling the morale of the incredible Ganga team. Started from Prayagraj on December 16, 2020, this journey, which is 6,000 km long and is to be completed in 8 months, is the world’s toughest and longest journey which is mentioned in the scriptures, but to date, no one has done such a parikrama of Mother Ganga, claimed Sharma. The former soldiers from the Armed forces and their other companions are determined to complete this adventurous journey and will continue through the cities, villages, plains, crossing mountains, forests and glaciers. “This is not just a journey, it is a vow that will allow us to breathe only after the Ganga Maiya is again rejuvenated and achieves its pristine glory. Therefore, along with the yatra, the team is running many campaigns whose results will be far-reaching in bringing back the glory of mother Ganga, said Sharma who has Col (Retd), RP Pandey, from Pune, Hirenbhai Patel from Ahmedabad, Rohit Umrao from Bareilly, Rohit Jat and Shagun Tyagi from Hapur besides Commander (Retd) Vishwanathan from Kerala as his permanent parikrama team members. Some of the main campaigns being undertaken by the team include pollution measurement wherein they are scientifically checking the quality of Ganga water every 10 km during the journey, the details of which will be available on their website. Besides identifying the pollution sources, every drain releasing water in the Ganga is being identified and detailed data is being prepared along with its geo-locking system. So far, pollution at over 500 points and their source has been reviewed, he added. Other activities of the team include 'Vrikshamal Abhiyan' wherein the team is planting trees to preserve and construct the environment on the entire Parikrama path besides undertaking public awareness initiatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/atulya-ganga-mission-team-in-city-after-grand-ganga-parikrama/articleshow/81727178.cms||---

While water supply from the Krishna river is adequate for the 12 lakh population in the city, tail-end areas of Vijayawada pose a challenge for the civic body every summer. Residents of Jakkampudi Colony, Chittinagar hilltop and other neighbourhoods struggle to locate sources of potable water in peak summer. Further, transmission losses due to damaged pipelines affect water supply in these areas. Minor repair works by the VMC have failed to yield results. Authorities of the civic body have resolved that every household shall get potable drinking water this summer. VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh, mayor R Bhagyalakshmi and officers of the engineering wing approved the repair of old pipelines before peak summer hits. Authorities estimate that water demand will increase to 160 million litres per day during summer and reservoirs and tanks will have to be cleaned to maintain gross storage levels. In a bid to overcome problems in hilly terrain, the VMC will install water boosters to pump the water. “The VMC is spending Rs 10 crores per annum on drinking water supply. We have additionally allocated Rs 75 lakhs to implement an action plan. Endowments minister Vellampalli Srinivas explained problems faced in Vijayawada West constituency. We are taking measure to ensure no one suffers drinking water shortage this summer,” Prasanna Venkatesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vmc-readies-plan-to-ensure-drinking-water/articleshow/81727556.cms||Venu Lanka

He also directed the monitoring of the functioning of CCTV cameras in the airport premises. Agarwal issued the instructions while chairing the meeting of the airport environment management committee. Meat shops near the airport, including at Chitkohra railway overbridge and Aneesabad among others, have often have been cited as the reason for flights facing bird-hit incidents. Similarly, trees around the airport, including those at Patna zoo and nearby government bungalows, are required to be pruned periodically to ensure an obstacle-free approach funnel for aircraft landing here. This is also done owing to the comparatively shorter length of the runway. In his presentation at the environment management committee meeting, airport director Bhupesh C Negi pointed out that the height of the trees has increased beyond the permissible limit and needed pruning. Accordingly, the divisional commissioner asked Patna divisional forest officer (DFO) to coordinate with the Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park (Patna zoo) to prune the trees. The Patna Municipal Corporation was asked to remove the encroachment near the airport entrance and the boundary wall. The civic body has also been told to take care of the stray dog menace in the airport vicinity. "Instructions have also been issued to shut the meat and fish shops near the airport. The SDO and the DSP concerned have been asked to initiate steps for the removal of such shops near the airport. The SDO and DSP will ensure closure of meat and fish shops at any cost," the divisional commissioner said. Agarwal also asked officials at the Patna airport to ensure scientific disposal of PPE kit by flyers. "It has been observed that despite sufficient number of bio-waste bin at the airport, some flyers still throw their PPE kit in the open. Instructions have been issued to ensure that they dump the kits in the dustbin and PMC has also been asked to clear the bio-waste bins at least four times every day," he said. Covid testing: Divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal inspected the Covid testing centre for incoming passengers at the airport. He asked the Patna civil surgeon to mandatorily test the flyers coming from Mumbai if they do not have a negative Covid test report. Agarwal asked officials to increase the number of daily tests to 400 and increase the number of counters and depute more healthcare workers if required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/remove-meat-shops-prune-trees-near-patna-airport/articleshow/81728090.cms||Piyush Tripathi

---||Patna||Munger firing: EC denies RTI info citing ‘danger to life’ as reason||PATNA: The Election Commission (EC) has rejected an RTI application seeking information on last year's Munger police firing on the grounds that the information sought "would endanger life and physical safety" if shared. One person was killed and several others were injured in police firing and stone-pelting during an idol immersion procession in Munger on October 26, 2020. “Information sought under Section 8(1)(g) would endanger the life and physical safety of any person or identity of the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes,” read the EC's reply received by Munger-based RTI activist Om Prakash Poddar. "I got the EC's response on March 8. It had cited threat to life as one of the reasons for refusing my application," Poddar told this newspaper on Saturday. The letter was sent by an additional secretary-cum-central public information officer of ECI Sujeet Kumar Mishra, he added. The central public information officer further said that Section 8 (1) (g) of RTI Act, 2005, exempted from giving information as it would hamper the investigation, arrest of any criminal or prosecution. “Hence the information sought under RTI Act 2005 can't be provided,” Mishra said in the letter sent to the Munger-based RTI activist. Poddar had requested from the state election commission to share the findings of the probe conducted by then divisional commissioner Asangba Chuba Ao on the police firing and about the disciplinary action taken against the officials based on the inquiry report. The petitioner had also sought relevant documents about the transfer of then DM Rajesh Meena and SP Lipi Singh from Munger following the incident. Poddar's petition was referred to the ECI on the plea that it was beyond its jurisdiction. Two days before the assembly polls in Munger on October 28, the poll panel had replaced the DM and the SP. The voter turnout was low due to the violence. The Magadh divisional commissioner had recorded the statements of victims, their relatives and eyewitnesses and collected digital evidence. The probe team had also visited the police stations, which bore testimony to hooliganism by the protestors in protest against the police firing. The divisional commissioner had submitted his report to the Election Commission within the stipulated period of a week. Poddar said the commissioner had also recorded the statement of the deceased Aniruddh Kumar's family members. When contacted, a Patna high court lawyer Rajiv Ranjan Kumar Pandey said the petitioner may move in the first appeal against denial of information under the RTI Act. The RIT activist said he would file a petition before the senior principal secretary, ECI, K N Bhar soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/munger-firing-ec-denies-rti-info-citing-danger-to-life-as-reason/articleshow/81727658.cms||Ramashankar

Tejashwi made a whirlwind election tour in Assam by a chartered helicopter and took part in four rallies, three of which were held in Barak Valley. He addressed rallies in Ratabari (SC) constituency (Karimganj), Dholai, Lakhipur (both in Chachar district) and Raha constituency (Nagaon) in favour of Congress candidates Sambhu Singh Mallah, Kamakhya Prasad Mala, Mukesh Pandey and Shashi Kanta Das. In all the four rallies, Tejashwi spoke in chaste Bhojpuri and Hindi, inviting thunderous applause from the audiences. He raised the issues of unemployment, sale of PSUs by the Narendra Modi government, unprecedented rise in the prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas as well as poor payment to the workers engaged in tea gardens of Assam. Tejashwi sought to know from the youths, “Are you not worried due to the lack of job opportunities? Are you not aware that the Modi government is selling all the profit-making PSUs?” Terming the BJP as ‘Badka Jhuttha Party’ (a party of big liars), Tejashwi called upon the youths in Assam to ensure the victory of the Congress-led alliance to protect their future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-campaigns-for-4-congress-candidates-in-assam/articleshow/81727715.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Congress names candidates, to cash in on ‘sympathy factor’||JAIPUR: The All India Congress Committee (AICC) on Saturday declared party candidates for the three assembly seats where bypolls are scheduled next month. The nominations were on the expected lines, which was to cash in on the ‘sympathy factor’ for Congress in Sujangarh and Sahara and to experiment with a new face in Rajsamand that has remained elusive to it since 2003. Bypolls on the three seats were necessitated by the demise of sitting legislators. The party fielded deceased legislator Bhanwar Lal Meghwal’s son Manoj Kumar Meghwal from Sujangarh in Churu district and deceased legislator Kailash Trivedi’s wife Gayatri Devi from Sahara in Bhilwara district. As both the seats were with the Congress, the party expects sympathy votes by nominating members of the deceased legislators’ families. BJP candidates from Sujangarh and Sahara are Khemaram Meghwal and Ratanlal Jat, respectively. Sujangarh assembly seat is reserved for the SC community candidates. Bhanwar Lal Meghwal, who represented it until recently, was a minister in the Ashok Gehlot cabinet. In Rajsamand assembly constituency, the sitting MLA was BJP’s Kiran Maheshwari, who died of post-corona ailments. She was a former cabinet minister. BJP too relied on the sympathy factor and announced Maheshwari’s daughter, Deepti Maheshwari from there. Congress candidate from Rajsamand would be Tansukh Bohara, a marble businessman who likes to be described as a social worker. Bohara hails from the Jain community. In the past three elections, Congress fielded Rajput candidates but failed to win against BJP candidate from the Vaishya community. Senior Congress leaders had already indicated that the party would change its strategy in the bypolls. The contest in Rajsamand promises to be interesting now. "We changed Rajsamand politics by winning the Nagar Parishad election from here recently after a gap of 30 years. We will do the same in the bypolls too," said PCC secretary and party’s Rajsamand in-charge Pushpendra Bhardwaj. BJP office bearers, on the other hand, said their party would repeat its victory in Rajsamand in the bypolls. Polling in the three constituencies would be held on April 17, while the counting of votes would take place on May 2. The three Congress candidates would file their nominations on March 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-names-candidates-to-cash-in-on-sympathy-factor/articleshow/81728582.cms||---

Schools, too, have issued notices asking students to refrain from playing Holi in groups. People who have been attending private Holi parties for years have plans to take the virtual route this time to include friends who are quarantined. Many who were planning to fly to Kolkata for Holi have cancelled tickets and yet others who have aged parents and kids at home do not want to risk gatherings. What everyone agreed on was that Covid has taught people how to adjust and make the best use of circumstances. And Holi will be no exception. Diamond City West resident Siddhartha Chatterjee, who was looking forward to a fun time over food, drinks and colours with four friends he has known since kindergarten, said, “We were disheartened at first. But we decided to be safe and go virtual. We’ll meet online at 10am and the party will start without any other restrictions on food, drinks, music and fun. We will each have red abir on our faces as we meet each other on-screen.” Upohar resident Alok Banerjee is in quarantine and will miss the party at his friend Sudeep Ganguly’s house. “He was so depressed in isolation that we decided to include him virtually, ensuring that we have a robust adda over food. He will join in with his family,” Ganguly said. Sumanta Saha and Rutu Vaidya who were planning to fly in from Mumbai to party at friend Ritesh Sarkar’s house have cancelled their tickets. Sarkar, instead, is arranging a virtual party from his Dum Dum house rooftop, complete with music, so that the trio can hang out on screen. A similar story was shared by Siddha Pines resident Manav Mehera, who will have a virtual party with city-based friends now located in Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Guwahati. Schools have sent alerts to parents and students to stay away from playing Holi. Board-year students have been warned by principals since reports of children getting infected are on the rise. “We have sent out messages asking parents not to allow kids to play Holi this year,” said Meena Kak, principal of Lakshmipat Sighania Academy. Vijaylakshmi Kumar, principal of Asian International School, echoed this while DPS Newtown principal Sonali Sen has put up a message on the school website asking all students to stay indoors this Holi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/its-safety-first-on-holi-with-parties-set-to-go-virtual/articleshow/81728330.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

From just 369 on March 1, the number of active cases has crossed the 1,000-mark in the state, much to the worry of health experts. Several districts, which had zero active case a month back, are also registering fresh cases. For instance, five districts – Arwal, Jehanabad, Sheikhpura, Saharsa and Supaul – had zero active case and 16 other districts had less than five active cases on February 26. A month later, only Sheikhpura had zero active case on March 26. The number of districts with less than five active cases has reduced to six. While none of the districts, except Patna, had more than 30 active cases on February 26, five districts had more than 30 active cases on March 26. Patna has witnessed an alarming jump in the number of active cases in one month. From 158 on February 26, the number of active cases rose to 418 on March 26. Health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit had said on Friday that they were keeping eye on people coming from other states, creating micro containment zones and focusing on districts sharing their borders with other states, especially Araria which is close to West Bengal. “Officials visit the micro containment zones and other spots to know the ground situation,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/threefold-increase-in-active-cases-in-one-month-worries-bihar-health-dept/articleshow/81727843.cms||Sheezan Nezami

On Saturday, the Rajkot crime branch busted a massive nationwide racket of cheating young job aspirants, mainly Class XII pass, with the promise of recruitment in the Indian Railways. The gang of six not only created a fake website of the Railway Recruitment Board (RRB) but also set up a bogus training centre in some unused building Lucknow where the victims were sent. They charged anything between Rs 12 lakh to Rs 15 lakh per aspirant and the money was deposited in various dubious accounts. The gang has cheated at least 42 people from Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh but police suspect there are many more victims. Of the seven victims from Gujarat, six are residents of Rajkot and one from Ahmedabad. “The irony is that the job aspirants were completely in dark that they were victims as they were undergoing training at the bogus centre. It was only after cops informed them that they realized they had been cheated,” said Manoj Agrawal, Rajkot police commissioner. Some people also used illicit ways of getting the jobs, so they kept their mouth shut. Police got information that a man named Shailesh Dalsaniya, having his office in Limbda Chowk area, was enticing parents with a promise of getting railway jobs for their wards in lieu of Rs 15 lakh. Dalsaniya charged Rs 26,000 for preparing the documents which are prepared by his aides - Kalpesh Sheth from Ahmedabad and Iqbal Khatri of Rajpipla. Sheth and Khatri then arranged for the aspirants’ training in their Lucknow centre. Mastermind of the racket, Himanshu Pandey from Lucknow, and two others are yet to arrested A crime branch team went to Lucknow and raided the centre with the help of local police. V K Gadhvi, inspector, crime branch said, “Before raiding, we first observed how the training centre was working. It was operating from an unused railway building in the Alambagh area.” The aspirants had to stay in hotels at their own expenses during three months of training. MV Rabari, sub inspector, crime branch added, “The accused had opened a bank account in the name of RRB Corporation and provided bogus pay slips.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/massive-railway-job-scam-busted/articleshow/81727597.cms||---

In an exclusive conversation with this newspaper on Saturday, Pandey said the state government would continue to be on high alert on this issue and added that the health department is working round the clock to check the spread of the virus. Leaves of all health workers, including doctors, have already been cancelled till April 5. Pandey admitted that there is a surge in the Covid cases but said it is mainly due to a large number of people returning home from other states to celebrate the festival of Holi with their families. The government has deputed teams at the airport, railway stations and bus stands for random testing. "Our work plan to fight the Covid challenge is focussed around three Ts - test, trace and treat," the minister said, adding, the number of tests has increased to about 50 thousand per day. Simultaneously, the pace of vaccination has increased to about one lakh daily, and over 25 lakh people vaccinated in the state. The minister said more vaccination centres would come up as inoculation of those above 45 is to begin from April. "We may include some new private hospitals having the cold chain facility for proper storage of the vaccines in the list of immunisation centres," he added. Replying to a query on villages are reporting lesser cases, Pandey said being higher in population density people of urban localities were more susceptible to get infected with the Covid virus. He said the surge in the number of positive cases in some parts of the country has warranted the need for more awareness campaigns in Bihar. "All districts have been asked to do campaign using loudspeakers, hoardings and banners, urging people to follow the use of masks, social distancing and seek medical help in case of Covid-related symptoms," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-new-covid-strain-found-in-bihar-health-minister/articleshow/81727829.cms||---

While men and women purchased new clothes, snacks and colours, children coaxed their parents into buying them the fanciest water guns. The two-day festival, which will begin with Holika Dahan on Sunday, marks the arrival of the vibrant spring season. Patna-based priest, Acharya Dinesh Pandey, told this newspaper, “Holika Dahan signifies the triumph of good over evil. Twigs, tree branches, ghee, and cow dung cakes are used for the rituals on the eve of Holi.” It has been a tradition in homemaker Kanti Singh’s family to keep aside all the food items cooked on Chhoti Holi and offer them to the community bonfire in the neighbourhood first. “We eat the food later,” the 46-year-old said. Meanwhile, a large number of Patnaites have decided to shun public gatherings and celebrate Holi indoors due to a sudden spike in the number of Covid-19 cases across the state. Like 2020, Indira Nagar resident Kiran Srivastava has not invited any guests on Holi this year. She claimed, “A lot of people did not take Covid-19 seriously last year. I hope they understand the gravity of the situation this time.” Mahuabagh resident Lalita Singh, who went Holi shopping on Saturday, will also celebrate the festival with family and friends. “I have decorated my living room and started cooking snacks for my guests,” she said in a celebratory mood. Covid casts shadow on small businesses: The Covid-19 pandemic continues to cast a shadow on vendors and shopkeepers with makeshift stalls in the city. Many of them are reporting fewer customers and poor sales this year. “I have not made any profit yet because of lesser number of customers,” rued Kanhaiya, the owner of a makeshift stall selling water guns, colours and masks in Digha. Another vendor, Anurag Kumar, said, “The prices of supplies like colours and sprinklers have gone up considerably after the Covid-induced lockdown, but people are not willing to pay so much.” Meanwhile, a large number of people, especially youngsters, have switched to online shopping in Covid times, thereby affecting the local traders. Railway Colony resident Seema Verma said, “I ordered herbal colours, curtains, clothes, and decorative items for my house from an online portal in order to avoid the huge rush in city markets.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/markets-packed-up-to-the-hilt-with-shoppers-in-patna/articleshow/81728108.cms||---

The chief minister gave a positive response in support of their demands, Singh said. They also discussed the issue pertaining to removal of 50% cap on reservation, the hearing related to which is taking place in the Supreme Court. The state government has already given its response to the SC supporting the removal of the cap. “First, we thanked the chief minister for putting up a strong case in the Supreme Court in support of 5% reservation for most backward class (MBC) and removal of 50% cap on reservation. Second, we raised issues pertaining to REET and nursing admissions, based on the agreement we had with the ministerial sub-committee on October 31, 2020. He assured us that all our demands, as per the agreement, will be fulfilled,” Singh told TOI. “Third, we requested him to set up a committee for effective implementation of Devnarayan scheme, which is not being run. He told the officers to look into our matter and told us to meet him again after 4-5 days if the issues are not resolved,” he added. Singh also said the Supreme Court should review the 50% cap on reservation and the ceiling should be removed. He also demanded that the central government should make the caste-based census, conducted by the government, public. “Since the population of all communities has increased over the years, the reservation under all categories (SC/ST/OBC) should be increased. The findings of the caste census should also be made public. In fact, the exercise should be conducted again as it has already been 10 years now,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/himmat-led-gujjars-raise-reet-admission-issue-with-gehlot/articleshow/81728584.cms||---

After laying the foundation and inaugurating 114 development projects worth Rs 279.30 crore in Maharajganj district on Saturday, the CM said, “A Vantangia village of the district has set an example for others by adopting contract farming. Those who are misguiding farmers should come to the Vantangia village and see the development model.” “Our government waived off farm loans of more than one lakh farmers in Maharajganj district alone. We are working to double the income of farmers and will ensure their prosperity,” he added. Inaugurating Chowk nagar panchayat building, Yogi said development generates employment opportunities and brings happiness. “We had declared Vantangia villages as revenue villages. The people of these villages will witness panchayat elections for the first time ever,” Yogi said. Announcing another infrastructure project, the CM said, “We are going to construct a border road along the Nepal border and work will start from Maharajganj. The road will go all along from Maharajganj to Pilibhit and will connect with Uttarakhand.” In the last four years, we created more than 100 municipal bodies out of which four are in Maharajganj. This will improve amenities, roads, sanitation and make standard of living better, the CM added. Medical colleges will be opened in public-private partnership mode in 16 districts that don’t have one while the existing ones will be upgraded, he said. The government is guaranteeing MSP and not a single Mandi has been closed, said Yogi. “This year the government has purchased 68 metric tonnes of paddy, which is 16 MT more than last year. From April 1, 6,000 government wheat purchasing centres will open in the state and payment will reach the farmers’ accounts within 72 hours,” he added. More than 58,000 women were appointed as Banking Sakhis in Gram Panchayats.

---||Patna||When WFH mode blurred line between work & personal life||PATNA: At a time when schools, colleges and offices were shut and the entire country came to a standstill due to the Covid-induced lockdown in 2020, millions of employees shifted to the work-from-home (WFH) mode overnight. Online meetings, virtual conferences and webinars became the order of the day as people remained confined within the four walls of their houses. The transition, however, was not always seamless. A senior sales manager at an ed-tech company, Mrinal Anand, told this newspaper, “The WFH mode required a lot of adjustments. Cracking a new deal over a Zoom call was difficult, to say the least.” Human resource specialist Mansi Mishra recalled that attending online meetings several times a day was hectic and time-consuming. “It often led to a lot of chaos and communication gaps among the participants,” she added. Working remotely took a toll on the physical and mental health of Bhumika Bajaj, a schoolteacher. She said, “Taking online classes, performing household chores and looking after my daughter simultaneously was extremely difficult.” Many, on the contrary, considered the WFH policy a blessing in disguise as they spent quality time with their families in 2020. “Although adapting myself to a new style of functioning was difficult in the beginning, I developed a strong bond with my family,” claimed Pushkar Singh, the regional manager of a marketing firm. Meanwhile, many sectors have embraced the WFH mode so that their businesses can continue without any hindrance amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Sonali, a software developer at a Bengaluru-based company, has shifted to the WFH mode permanently. She said, “Something that was implemented abruptly is gradually being embraced by one and all.” Like Sonali, several other professionals have set up a WFH ‘office’ in their houses as a result of which the demand for a strong and high-speed internet connectivity has gone up in the city. “A good internet connectivity is more important than ever before. When our customers face a problem now, they tell us and we respond immediately,” claimed Vijay Kumar, subdivisional officer at the BSNL’s Khajpura division. Prateek Ranjan Shrivastava, a broadband service provider, even reduced his prices for luring more customers. “We have upgraded our equipment and increased manpower to make sure that the customers are not disappointed and can work from home comfortably,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/when-wfh-mode-blurred-line-between-work-personal-life/articleshow/81727940.cms||---

The results were published on Friday. One of the boys had charges of scuffling, among others, filed against him, his brother and their father at the Nalanda police station on April 29, 2019. The other boy had an FIR of motorbike theft filed against him with Harnaut police station on June 28, 2019, said additional public prosecutor Rajesh Pathak. He said the court of the chief judicial magistrate referred the first case to the JJB on May 24, 2019, while the second case was referred to it on March 2 this year. APP Pathak said the JJB court was impressed with their scores (both were around 15 at the time of committing the alleged crimes) in the Intermediate (science) examination, and keeping their future in mind, acquitted them of all charges. Pathak said the Nalanda accused secured 69% while the Harnaut juvenile got 65% marks in the intermediate science stream. "As they are talented and want to pursue engineering from outside the state and they were made accused in no other cases except the present ones, therefore, it is in the best of their interest, care, progress, health, treatment and social integration that they are acquitted of all charges," Pathak quoted the court as saying. He said the court-ordered no further hearing in the cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jjb-acquits-two-juveniles-who-fared-well-in-intermediate-exam/articleshow/81727910.cms||Farrukh Nadim

It is also unique as it has a 7D theatre. A zoo is not only a medium of entertainment and knowledge, but also plays a role in employment generation,” Yogi added. CM Yogi asked the administration to make entry of school children free for at least one month. “All Covid protocols should be followed by visitors. Tell people and institutions that they can adopt any animal for three months up to a year,” he added. “Kakori incident was planned in Shahjahanpur by Pt. Ram Prasad Bismil and Shaheed Ashfaqullah Khan with Thakur Bhushan Singh and Chandra Shekhar Azad. We are building a memorial of Pt. Ram Prasad Bismil, Shaheed Ashfaqullah Khan, Thakur Roshan Singh and Chandra Shekhar Azad in Shahjahanpur.” “Lucknow zoo is quite old but it is still a source of employment for many. People should take care and preserve the property,” he said. “There is Asiatic lion and Bengal tiger in the zoo. Till date, 151 animals have been brought and the number would reach 400. Before Deepawali something new would be introduced in the zoo,” the Cm added. The CM also performed a puja on the occasion and went around the enclosures in the zoo on a golf cart. The chief minister also inaugurated the ODOP store, 7D theatre and watched a short film. He also inaugurated a book on zoo. Forest minister Dara Singh said CM Yogi has made the state a hub of tourism and eco-tourism. MP Ravi Kishan also praised CM Yogi for his development work and said he is happy as he can shoot movies in the zoo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cm-inaugurates-gorakhpur-zooterms-it-as-a-testimony-of-devpt/articleshow/81727996.cms||---

The girl was rescued by her family members and villagers from the shop of one of the accused on Friday afternoon in unconscious state due to impact of liquor. One of the accused Prakash (26), who has a jewellery shop in the village, is married and had allegedly raped the same girl on earlier occasions also in his shop and had threatened the girl not to disclose it to anyone. “On Friday also, he forced the girl to come to his shop in the afternoon and also called a friend, identified as Shravan (25). They forced the minor girl to consume liquor and raped her. Due to the liquor, she started vomiting and fell unconscious,” said ASP (Jodhpur Rural) Sunil Panwar. Scared after seeing the condition of the girl, the duo came out of the shop but some villagers spotted the girl in the shop in a bad condition and informed the family and others. Villagers rescued the girl and rushed her to the hospital, from where she was referred to Umaid Hospital in Jodhpur the same night. One of the accused was caught by them but the other one managed to escape from the spot. “We got the statements of the girl recorded and got her medical examination conducted by a medical board, which confirmed gang-rape,” said Panwar, adding that the condition of the girl is better now. The girl, a class VII student, lives with her uncle as she has no father and her mother also lives at some other place. On Friday, she had left for some work after coming from school, when Prakash spotted her and forced her to come inside his shop. “Shravan was detained the same day, but Prakash had absconded. We had launched a hunt for him and arrested both of them on Saturday following the medical report and statements of the survivor,” Panwar said. The incident triggered outrage among the villagers. They kept the market shut on Saturday, protesting against the incident and demanding immediate arrest of the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/two-held-for-raping-13-yr-old-in-jodhpur/articleshow/81728592.cms||---

We have now provided 504 — 68 ventilator beds, 41 ICU beds and 395 beds with oxygen support. Orders to 23 private hospitals have already been issued and they will make the beds available with immediate effect,” the officer said. The remaining beds would be available next week. Nashik civic chief Kailas Jadhav, during the Covid-19 review meeting on Friday, had said the system would be scaled up to meet the patients’ requirements. Since all the dedicated Covid hospitals are in Nashik city and the civic body governs them, the corporation has decided to take the help of private hospitals in achieving the target. The 23 private hospitals — from Mumbai Naka, Cidco, Satpur, Panchavati, College Road, Indira Nagar, Nashik Road — have been roped in for infrastructure support. They will not only provide treatment to the patients needing ventilator and ICU beds, but also to those who need oxygen support. “We have got more than 300 people as health workers. We also have got eight MBBS doctors against the demand of 25. The NMC has got the support of about 100 BAMS doctors — who will form a team to provide the services to patients in at least 500 beds at the various places,” the officer said.

The energy storage system at the substation will make the supply of power more reliable and help avoid grid failure in case of any exigency. At the launch, the minister added that the storage system is robust and will be of massive use, as it is environment friendly, uses no water and produces no emissions. Jain said that the battery system has a life span of 10-20 years. “When there’s peak load, transformers usually burn out, causing power failure. This only works for a month or two. In the months of June-July, when there’s a peak, the battery will aid in the power supply. And when there’s a low power demand, it will get discharged,” he said, adding that the battery is a reasonable priced lithium-ion one. Earlier, energy storage systems were very expensive, the minister said. “For this battery system, if we take 4 hours of storage, it would mean 150KW, and for 1 hour it is 600Kw. The cost is Rs 1 crore,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/community-power-storage-system-in-city/articleshow/81728598.cms||---

This month, 472 kids in that age bracket have tested positive for Covid-19, and the number is expected to cross 500 over the weekend. Of the 472 cases, 244 are boys and 228 girls.

"A party becomes a dictator when it gets full majority in Parliament. It is sad that there is no opposition in our country. The farmers' issue could have been raised in the Parliament strongly had there been an opposition.” Tikait during a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Dausa said the farmers’ agitation will continue for long and a “roadmap for the movement has to be prepared for the next months”. He said, “Next, we have to free the state of Gujarat from the clutches of this (BJP) government”.He said the Centre wants to destroy villages and capture lands of the farmers. He said if the farmers’ movement had not taken place in the country, the central government would have by now introduced a new “seed bill”, to benefit the private companies as the government would decide “what seed should be sown by the farmer”. “If this movement dies down, the government will introduce the seed bill as well and it will become a law as the three farm laws. It is a conspiracy to snatch your land and destroy the villages. The only way out in this situation is ‘andolan’,” said Tikait while addressing the farmers at Pachwara in Dausa district. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/will-cut-power-lines-to-16-states-if-demands-not-met-tikait/articleshow/81728605.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Use existing SOPs effectively to contain double mutant: Centre||NAGPUR: Declining to share results of genome sequencing of 100 swab samples of the district, the central government on Saturday reportedly stated there was no need for different standard operating procedures (SOPs) for containing the double mutant variant of Covid-19 and directed the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and district administration to implement year-old SOPs in an effective manner. Expressing displeasure over spike in cases in the district, the centre directed the officials to isolate as much asymptomatic positive patients as possible in institutional facilities and increase fines for violations of Covid Appropriate Behaviour (CAB). Sources from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) told TOI that officials from centre declined to share results of genome sequencing with the district officials. Nagpur district registered 54 deaths on Saturday, which was probably the highest among all districts in the country for the day. Such high number of fatalities were recorded in a day in 185 days. It is also the highest single-day toll in the second wave which picked up in the district from the third week of February. The district continued to record high number of cases. Cases were 3,688 on Saturday. Though cases reduced by 407 as compared to Friday’s record spike of 4,095, it was the 11th consecutive day when over 3,000 cases were recorded. After announcing detection of double mutant variant in around 20% swab samples of the district a couple of days ago, union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and other officials from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and NEETI Ayog held meeting for the first time with the officials of 46 districts witnessing spike in cases. The central team reportedly expressed concerned about Nagpur, Pune and Aurangabad and held discussion in details about these districts through video conferencing. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and collector Ravindra Thakare attended the meeting. Later, civic chief held meeting with zonal medical officers and gave various types of directives issued by the centre. Centre officials stressed tracing and testing at least 30 contacts after one positive patient and ensuring institutional isolation as much as possible. Directives were given to maintain 70% tests of RT-PCR and remaining 30% of rapid antigen test (RAT). According to the sources, Centre also asked to expedite vaccination of above 45 year people, especially from areas having high number of cases and test positivity rate. The district is registering around 3,500 cases per day, which means the authorities here will have to trace and test 1.05 lakh people per day, which will be multiplied with every passing day. Currently, testing is around 17,000 per day. Out of the total 37,343 active cases in the district, only 431 positive patients including 305 from the city are in Covid care centres (CCCs). Sources said centre is of the view that implementation of containment zone system is not proper. The NMC in its presentation showed over 18,000 containment zones but each zone is covering only one individual house. The centre reportedly gave directions to declare part of an area as containment zone and seal it. “Tests of all people residing in containment zone should be done within 72 hours of detection of positive patient. Strict isolation of these people including those negative should be ensured,” the MoHFW officials said. The centre directed the officials to do death audit of Covid-19 victims citing high fatality rate in GMCH and IGGMCH. “Spread can be controlled to a great extent in case of CAB. Penalty should be increased and strict action should be taken against violators,” MoHFW officials said. Amravati divisional commissioner Piyush Singh told TOI, “Akola, Buldhana and Yavatmal districts were part of the meeting. We are already tracing and testing 15 contacts of each positive patient which will be increased to 20 soon. Centre has demanded effective implementation of guidelines to break the chains. According to officials virus will keep on mutating in case cases keep increasing. The five-fold strategy given by centre also includes expedition of vaccination programme.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/use-existing-sops-effectively-to-contain-double-mutant-centre/articleshow/81728597.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Lucknow||Vir Chakra winner Lucknow University alumnus recalls INS Panvel’s conquest||LUCKNOW: While India and Bangladesh celebrate 50th anniversary 1971 liberation war, not many would be aware of the crucial role played by a 29-meter-long ship, INS Panvel, carrying a crew of 30 and fitted with two 40/60 Bofors guns. Called ‘Lilliputian’ by some veterans, the ship not only dodged heavy fire power of Indian Air Force's Gnats due to miscommunication, but ultimately captured the vital Khulna harbour, the garrison of Pakistan military with huge stockpiles of weapons and other materials. One of the key members of the INS Panvel crew was a Lucknow University alumnus, Commander Ashok Kumar (then sub-lieutenant), who hails from Bahraich. Ashok was commissioned in the navy as officer in August month of 1971 and was assigned in the Bangladesh liberation war in December at the age of 23-years. Photo credit: Naval History DivisionNow based in Mumbai, Vir Chakra winner Kumar, now 73, vividly recalls the act of valour of the 'Lilliputian' and its men. “I was a gunnery officer who was just commissioned in the Navy and had no experience of war. Prior to joining the liberation war on INS Panvel as a team of ‘Force Alpha’, our Lilliputian had met a huge cyclone in the night of October 30, 1970 near Paradip. Back then we thought it was the end of our story as the ship was out of control in huge waves. But nobody had an idea that months later our ship and the crew will write a history of unmatched courage and determination,” said Kumar, whose ship was assigned for facilitating Bangladeshi refugees at Sandeshkhali, Hasnabad (West Bengal) till December 3, 1971. Photo credit: Naval History Division“After the war was declared, Lt General Jagjit Singh Aurora and Major General JFR Jacob ordered the Force Alpha comprising INS Panvel, Mukti Bahini gun boats Padma, Palash and BSF craft Chitrangada under the leadership of Commander Mohan Narayan Rao Samant -- a submariner -- to launch a waterborne attack on Chalna and Mongla harbours controlled by Pakistan military," he said. "Later, the fleet advanced toward Khulna port (Pakistan military garrison ) from the Rupsha river. The attack's purpose was to break Pakistan military strength and help the army's 41 brigade to capture the area. By December 10 morning, when we reached Chalna and Mongla ports, we experienced very little resistance as the previous night of December 9, the bombers and fighters of INS Vikrant had razed the two ports. After neutralizing the remaining enemies, boat Chitrangada was left behind to assist injured Bangladeshi nationals, while the rest three other boats headed toward Khulan,” said the veteran sailor. INS Panvel was led by Lt commander Joseph Pius Alfred Noronha. His ship was leading the fleet of three small ships. “By 11 am, we reached Khulan and saw Pakistani soldiers resting on the west bank of Rupsha. Since our fleet had no signature or Indian flag to hint about it being an Indian boat, the Pakistani presumed that the trio were their boats, as they were not expecting enemy ships to take risks and expose themselves in open just 100 odd meters away from the river bank. I don’t know who came up with this idea. However, to be saved from our friendly fire the ship superstructure was painted yellow and a flag, too, of the same colour was raised -- a pre-arranged signal for being identified by IAF aircraft as friendlies. But unfortunately, due to possible miscommunication, three IAF Gnats attacked our fleet, Padma and Palash were completely destroyed and sunk, while their crew jumped into the water. As our crew was making efforts to retrieve the injured from the river, we saw a second wave of IAF Gnats heading toward INS Panvel, but fortunately this time they probably recognized us as friendly following which Pakistani soldiers and the militia (razakars) started heavy fire at us,” said Kumar. “Seeing the survivors of Padma and Palash being hit in water with rain of bullets by Pakistani, Cdr Samant and Lt Cdr Noronha ordered to bomb the entire Khulna anchorage, and for the next half an hour 600 rounds were fired from Bofors guns. We levelled the entire Pakistani garrison. In the counter-attack by Pakistani military, a BSF jawan, at a few Mukti Bahini men were killed, while Noronha narrowly missed getting injured, Samant suffered a grazing bullet wound and I was hit with a bullet which went through my ribs,” he added. “The harbour was captured and we changed the course of war,” added Kumar who was awarded Vir Chakra for fighting against odds. Force Alpha was given three Maha Vir Chakras (including to Noronha, Samant and a navy diver named C Singh), five Vir Chakras including Ashok Kumar and his subordinate KS Raju, LEMP (Leading electrical mechanic power), two Nao Sena Medal Gallantry. Commander Samant passed away in 2019 in Mumbai, while Lt Cdr Noronha died last July in Bengaluru. The same sequence of events were recently described by Commodore Srikant B Kesnur in his findings. He is the official historian for Indian Navy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vir-chakra-winner-lu-alumnus-recalls-ins-panvels-conquest/articleshow/81729038.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The positivity rate at present is between 45-50%,” said Thackeray who tested positive for Covid four days back and is under home isolation. According to Thackeray, one major problem the civic body has been facing is carrying out contact tracing in case of many patients who take treatment at home and are not informing the civic body about the infection. “In such cases, we remain clueless about the patients contacts who has to be tested. Hence, the infection is spreading in the town,” she said. Although the case fatality rate (CFR) in Malegaon remains lows, the active cases in the last 10 day have spiked from 811 to 1,451. There are 171 containment zones in the city at present. Malegaon IMA president Mayur Shah, too, said that the situation in the city is grave. “Leave alone beds, many of the private hospitals in the city are facing shortage of ventilators. Patients are not coming to hospitals early for treatment. They are initially undergoing treatment at home and when their condition worsens, they are brought to hospitals. And, many of them have to be put on ventilator support,” said Shah. Shah has appealed to people to get themselves tested if they have Covid-like symptoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/scarcity-of-covid-beds-in-hospitals-ventilators-in-malegaon/articleshow/81727043.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Aurangabad||Despite weekend curfew, Aurangabad fuel stations witness huge rush||AURANGABAD: The weekend curfew in the district notwithstanding, fuel stations have been witnessing long queues of motorists waiting to fill fuel in their vehicles. The rush even led to some fuel stations going dry on Saturday. As per the directives issued by the district administration as well as the police, during the weekends and the weekday night curfew hours of 8 pm to 5 am, fuel must only be sold to vehicles involved in essential services, including public transport. Authorities suspect the fear of a complete lockdown, fuelled by the rumours going viral on social media, may have prompted the rush to refuel vehicles. Police had to be deployed at several fuel stations in the city and some stations even stopped the services temporarily to disperse the long queues. Barricades were also erected at the fuel station entrances and policemen were seen checking identity proof of motorists to ascertain if they qualified for the essential services category, before they were allowed to proceed for refueling. However, the Petrol Pump Dealers’ Association (PDA) of Aurangabad has blamed the administration for “unnecessarily” imposing restrictions and causing panic. The association is also upset over the district administration sealing three fuel stations in the city and eventually causing diversion of the rush to other pumps. PDA secretary Aqeel Abbas said: “Selling fuel to only essential services is unlikely to solve the issue, as people are filling their vehicle tanks as they fear more curbs.” He added that with fuel prices skyrocketing, people are using their vehicles judiciously and stepping out only when necessary. Hiren Patel, another member of the association, said that even during the 2020 lockdown, there were no such restrictions and people were able to get fuel as per their requirement. He reiterated that PDA is strictly implementing the ‘No Mask, No Fuel’ policy. Some of the fuel stations even refused to give petrol to policemen citing that the communication from the district administration does not mention police as essential services. This also led to heated arguments at one fuel station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/despite-weekend-curfew-aurangabad-fuel-stations-witness-huge-rush/articleshow/81727054.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Though the present vaccination drive is dedicated to seniors, Harsh will roll up his sleeves to take the “jab”, but of a different kind. With the world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination drive underway in India and the country crossing the 5.5 crore immunisation mark, ‘anti-Covid pichkaris’ have flooded the city markets and are selling like hot cakes. The water guns, which resemble a Covid vaccine, come with a price tag of Rs 500 or more depending on the quality. Amid the heated political battle in poll-bound states, Holi revellers in the Sangam city,are all set to forget the political rivalry and join the big shots of Indian politics in celebrating Holi this year. People are all set to celebrate Holi with the sprinklers named after the stalwarts of political bigwigs. Be it the two stalwarts of the BJP, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah or the heavyweights of various parties including the Congress party, pichkaris (water gun), water cylinders, fancy colour bombs and other items used for playing Holi named after political figures are selling like hotcakes. As the market is slowly limping back to normal, as compared to the loss during the past ten months because of the Covid-19 pandemic, there is also a huge demand for Indian products with buyers vocally refusing Chinese items. Talking of the markets and products sold for Holi in the Sangam city, the pichkari named ‘Priyanka water gun’ is all set to give stiff competition to the popularity of ‘Modi pichkari’. Likewise, 'Priyanka Gulal’ or Abeer (as is called in many parts of the northern parts of the country) too will spread colours among those celebrating Holi. Apart from these, all-time favourite water guns named after Dabang, Munni, Sheila, Ben 10, Nija Hatodri, Pogo, Hathi pichkari are also in great demand. “This year there is more demand for the made-in-India pichkaris which are available at a price range of Rs 50-750 and are quite popular. However, nothing comes close to matching the sale of the pichkaris named after political big-wigs,” said Mohammad Qadir, the popular shopkeeper of the Chowk. The markets also have gift packs of herbal colours in the range of Rs 125 to 150 and the latest design adorning the shops is the cannon pichkari. Along with these, the Gulal bomb and colourful Chattai and Anar too are in demand. There is a special demand for herbal colours, specially made in India. Besides, the market is buzzing with hectic buying of products like Papad, sweets, chocolates, different varieties of namkeen (snacks), Ghujia, beverages etc. The readymade garment shops too witnessed heavy purchase, especially by youth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/covid-vaccine-pichkaris-set-to-give-you-a-colourful-shot-this-holi/articleshow/81727191.cms||---

It was a dedicated Covid hospital back then and 15 critical Covid patients were undergoing treatment. After fire broke out, three critical patients died while being shifting to another ward. The investigation had revealed that the fire broke out due to short-circuit in the sensors fitted to manage oxygen supply.Hospital dean S S More said, “After the incident, we conducted fire and electrical safety audits from Kolhapur Municipal Corporation and electricity department. Both emphasised on overhauling of the safety measures. For instance, they suggested that the old electrical wires be removed and replaced with new fittings.” He added, “They also suggested changes in the design of the buildings in the hospital premises to make it safer for the patients and staff during disasters. We had sought Rs 8 crore for the fire safety work and Rs 2 crore for the electrical safety works.”More, however, said that the minor suggestions made by both the agencies to mitigate disasters have been carried out. “We have placed fire extinguishers at appropriate spots in the buildings. The staff is provided with the fire safety training regularly. Also, mock drills for rescue during fire disasters are carried out with the help disaster management teams,” said More.Currently, 50% of the beds in the hospital are reserved for Covid patients and remaining for non-Covid patients. If the cases go up again, then the hospital may be once again likely to be declared as dedicated Covid Hospital. The administrative officials of the hospitals claim that state directorate of health will be once again reminded of the proposal sent six months ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/cprs-plan-for-fire-safety-awaiting-funds-for-6-months/articleshow/81727055.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Justice 36 years after wrongful sacking||Ahmedabad: Thirty-six years of litigation rendered two government employees unable to get back to their job despite the Gujarat high court’s order for reinstatement after their wrong sacking. Since one of them passed away during the three decades of court proceedings and the other reached the age of retirement, the high court ordered it proper to award lump sum compensation of Rs 6 lakh in each of the cases. Liyaqatalikhan Batangi and Dilshad Kadri were temporarily appointed linen keepers of the Employees State Insurance Scheme (ESIS) in Gandhinagar in 1981 on the basis of their training in tailoring. Their one-year contract was renewed till 1985, when they were sacked saying that they lacked essential qualifications and the tailoring courses were not from government-recognized institutes. Both of them unsuccessfully approached the Gujarat Civil Services Tribunal, which declined their appeal against the termination orders. They moved the Gujarat high court, which in 2001, held that they should be reinstated in service. While Kadri’s qualification was upheld, the department was asked to send Batangi to complete a certificate course in a government institute. The state government was not ready to reinstate them and filed an appeal before division bench. The appeal remained pending for two decades. Batangi passed away and Kadri reached the age of retirement. The case came up for the hearing before Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice Gita Gopi, who concluded that the single-judge bench’s order of reinstatement was proper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/justice-36-years-after-wrongful-sacking/articleshow/81728140.cms||---

It offered huge returns to the extent of up to 12% interest per month. Later, the firm went bust in 2018 and the Bengaluru police had registered multiple FIRs. However, recently an FIR following a complaint by a city man Lucky Singh, was registered at at the Bajaria police station under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code against Syed Khizar Husain and father son-duo Fareed Ahmed and Afaque Ahmed, all natives of Halli in Bengaluru and allegedly associated with Ambidant Ponzi scam. “Following the FIR , a team of city police conducted a raid at a hideout in Bengaluru and arrested one of the accused Syed Khizar Husain from Bengaluru on March 24. Now, we have launched searches for absconding father-son duo Fareed Ahmed and Afaque Ahmed,” said station house officer Bajaria Ram Murti Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/city-police-arrest-a-ponzi-scam-accused-in-bengaluru/articleshow/81728000.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Aurangabad||All hospitals in Aurangabad comply with safety norms||Aurangabad: All hospitals from urban and rural areas of Aurangabad district, including those having bed capacity of 50 or more have necessary compliance with fire safety norms, R K Sure, chief fire officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation said on Saturday. Aurangabad district has around 930 hospitals, of which 110 fall in the category of large hospitals, Sure said. “After Bhandara hospital tragedy early this year, all state-run and private hospitals with more than 50 beds were asked to carry out fire-audit without fail and get NOC from us. These large hospitals showed compliance with our order,” he said.Sure said the local civic body in past has passed a resolution due to which hospitals with less than 50 beds do not need to carry out fire audit. “The small hospitals have to ensure that modern fire-fighting system is in place and give a written compliance to this effect. After Bhandara incident, the health institutions not undergoing necessary formalities were also served with notices to get things done,” he said. The checks on fire audit at hospitals have come to fore again after a massive fire at a medical facility in Mumbai on Thursday. The hospital was treating Covid-19 patients and was located in a mall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/all-hospitals-in-aurangabad-comply-with-safety-norms/articleshow/81727061.cms||---
---||Goa||Stimac to continue experimenting as India brace for tougher UAE challenge||India coach Igor Stimac has asked his players to get out of the Indian Super League (ISL) mode and wake up to the reality of international football. India managed a 1-1 draw against Oman in the first international friendly last week, thanks largely to an inspired second-half performance. But in the opening 45 minutes, they were found wanting. “In international football, when you provide space and time for opposition, you will get hurt,” Stimac told reporters during an online interaction on Sunday. “Our players need to understand this is not ISL where you have lots of time and space to control in the middle. If you behave here like the ISL, you will get badly hurt. We need to change our young players’ mindset how to adapt to international football.” Stimac used six debutants in his starting lineup against Oman and finished the game with 10 players having a taste of international football for the first time. The “learning process”, the Croatian coach said, would continue even as he expects a tougher challenge against United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the Zabeel Stadium in Dubai on Monday. “I expect UAE to be more difficult opponents,” Stimac told TOI. “They are more technical side than Oman. They play quicker football and lots of high pressure. This will be another difficult test for the youngsters.” India handpicked these difficult opponents as preparations for the final leg of the Fifa World Cup 2022 qualifiers in June where they have three games remaining and need to win two for a direct spot in the third round of the Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers. “We are here to get experience, to find out what we can expect from these players who are here for the first time,” said Stimac. From among the first-timers, Lalengmawia, or Apuia as he is popularly known, covered himself in glory after taking the field in the second half. The NorthEast United midfielder will now be handed his first international start, while it remains to be seen what roles other impressive debutants like Chinglensana Singh – excellent, in the words of the coach -- Suresh Singh and Bipin Singh have to play against UAE. What is certain is that Adil Khan will replace Sandesh Jhingan at the heart of India’s defence. Gurpreet Singh Sandhu will wear the captain’s armband and guard India’s goal, ahead of Amrinder Singh, who played the last game. “From the groups that I have been involved since the beginning of coach Igor’s stint, the approach and mentality is to play without fear and go out there to win games. “For sure, it’s good to have this approach and that’s why there is less fear in the team and more excitement, more energy. We do not want to be a team who can be beaten easily,” said Gurpreet. Just like the World Cup qualifiers, India continued to pose problems for Oman. UAE, ranked 74, 30 places above India, will be a different ball game.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stimac-to-continue-experimenting-as-india-brace-for-tougher-uae-challenge/articleshow/81739779.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Allahabad||BJP worker’s body with multiple wounds found in Pratapgarh||PRAYAGRAJ: Tension prevailed at Pithapur Malak village in Kohdaur area of Pratapgarh on Saturday after the body of 52-year-old booth president of BJP was found by the roadside. The victim had tried to intervene in a dispute between two parties and was allegedly beaten to death on Friday night. Additional SP (east) Surendra Dwivedi and CO (city) Abhay Pandey rushed to the village with heavy force from five police stations and PAC personnel, but had to face opposition from the kin of the deceased and locals. After hours of pacifying the villagers, police finally sent the body for a post-mortem examination in the afternoon after SDM promised to provide a compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the bereaved kin. “We have registered an FIR against two men, both brothers, on the complaint of the deceased’s brother-in-law,” he said. The victim, Dhirendra Bahadur Singh, was a resident of Pithapur Malak village under Kohdaur police station area. At 9.30pm on Friday, two people started cutting sugarcane from the field of a farmer Rajan Singh without his permission, which resulted in an altercation between them. As the spot was just 200 metres from Dhirendra’s house, he also reached the spot and snatched the bike keys from the two men. The issue was soon resolved and Rajan and his father Nagendra left for home, said Kohdaur police station SHO Bachhelal. However, Dhirendra went missing thereafter and his body bearing multiple injury marks was found on the road close to the site of the dispute on Saturday morning. The locals alleged that Dhirendra was beaten to death by two brothers Ranjeet and Vipin Saroj of the nearby Hatsara Mangapur village after he tried to intervene in their fight with Rajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bjp-workers-body-with-multiple-wounds-found-in-pratapgarh/articleshow/81727213.cms||---

Among those who have been critical of the decision taken by the akhada on Friday is Haridwar-based ashram, Matri Sadan's head Swami Shivanand, who said that the move is “against Hindu religion as no family man can be anointed mahamandaleshwar in this manner”. He said, “It is very unfortunate that a person who has not taken sanyas is going to become mahamandleshwar. Rathore has a wife and three children. We demand an immediate ban on Niranjani akhada. The akhada is part of the seer community and they have no right to anoint a family man as mahamandleshwar. Also, the akhada acted like a business venture by selling its land after constructing residential flats. If Niranjani akhada goes on with its decision, Matri Sadan will approach the court against the anointment of Rathore.” Earlier, Niranjani akhada secretary Ravindra Puri had claimed that mahamandleshwar is an honorary post and a family man could be selected for it. As reported by TOI earlier, Suresh Rathore belongs to the Dalit community and already holds the title of Ravidasacharya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/seers-protest-niranjani-akhadas-decision-to-anoint-bjp-mla-as-its-mahamandaleshwar/articleshow/81727543.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Riders use fake registration to evade banks over pending dues||AURANGABAD: More than four dozen two-wheeler riders have been caught using fake registration, taking police by surprise as most of them did not want their vehicles seized by financial institutions for non-payment of instalments. Police said all these riders caught during a drive across the city in the last one month have been booked for cheating and criminal breach of trust. In January, city police commissioner Nikhil Gupta decided to launch a drive on a daily basis after a person was caught using bogus registration on the vehicle to evade recovery agents of banks and other financial institutions. During the drive, police teams also caught a number of stolen bikes that were sold to people at throwaway prices, said an officer. Deputy commissioner of police (zone-I) Nikesh Khatmode Patil, who has been leading the drive, said, “In all of the cases, people did it either to evade recovery agents or the bikes were stolen and sold to gullible people through mechanics, agents or even directly by thieves.” Crime branch inspector Avinash Aghav said the record of every vehicle that is stopped at checkpoint is being verified using different applications. “A large number of people have confessed that they were not able to pay bank loans and so they started using different number plates. Whatever the case may be, it is a criminal offence,” said Aghav. The officer said that on Friday, two siblings were arrested from the Gandhinagar area of the city after police found that their family was using a common registration number for three different bikes . The process of digging out more details of these bikes is under way, said police. A large number of citizens has been unable to pay off instalments for loans taken from banks and financial institutions for flats, vehicles and other things since the lockdown imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic. That the financial problems is so serious can be gauged from a number of citizens having failed to clear their electricity bills, which generally does not happen as nobody wants their power snapped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/riders-use-fake-registration-to-evade-banks-over-pending-dues/articleshow/81727069.cms||Mohammed Akhef

At least six journalists who took part in the elections have also tested positive so far. One of them was admitted to SGPGIMS late Saturday evening. Another death that took place at KGMU on Saturday was of an under treatment patient, a 57-year-old man from Mahanagar, who was admitted on March 6 after testing positive. He also had chronic liver disease and died due to respiratory failure. The city has become a “hotspot” in the state with a steady rise in the number of cases and deaths in the past few days. Out of four Covid-19 deaths in UP on Saturday, three took place in Lucknow. Similarly, 25% of the total new infections were in the state capital. In remaining districts, the numbers were below 50.

---||Goa||Fear of big teams has vanished: Gurpreet||Panaji: Gurpreet Singh Sandhu has welcomed the challenge to his numero uno position in the Indian football team. Whether it was Stephen Constantine earlier or Igor Stimac now, Gurpreet remains the undisputed first choice goalkeeper for coaches. He has proved he has the safest pair of Indian hands, but with Amrinder Singh having a memorable season with champions Mumbai City FC, questions are being asked. Not that it worries the man who was part of Norwegian outfit Stabaek FC for three years and remains the only Indian footballer to play in the Europa League, European football’s second-tier club competition. “Like the coach said you need someone to push Manvir (Singh), I am very lucky that I have Amrinder and I am sure Amrinder feels the same,” Gurpreet said on Sunday. “If there was no Amrinder, or if there was no Gurpreet for Amrinder, we would not be at this level and competing for this lone spot (in the team). I feel very fortunate to have this competition.” Amrinder guarded India’s goal in the 1-1 draw against Oman last week and will now make way for Gurpreet for the second friendly against United Arab Emirates (UAE) in Dubai on Monday. He will also captain the side. For coach Stimac, the fight for places between the two goalkeepers, friends and “great human beings” is welcome. “It’s great to have such headaches,” said Stimac. “It's not only that. Both of them are great human beings too. They do everything to keep the mood positive in the camp.” India started off shakily against Oman but improved considerably in the second half for a draw, their most impressive result since stopping Asian champions Qatar – with Gurpreet in fine form -- in the Fifa World Cup qualifier. The next challenge is against a strong UAE, and even though the hosts are ranked 30 spots higher, Gurpreet said they won’t be overawed. “I think it will be a tough game but honestly speaking, the more we get opportunities in games like these, the less fear we have in our minds and bodies. That’s what I feel, and I am sure others feel the same. “If you look at six to ten years ago, the games we were playing were not as competitive. In the last three or four years, we have been playing good opposition and fear of playing these big teams has vanished. I feel it’s a tough game, but we are not scared of anyone. We will go out there and give everything,” said Gurpreet. The goalkeeper did not have a particularly good season as Bengaluru FC failed to qualify for the Indian Super League (ISL) playoffs for the first time. Gurpreet, a two-time winner, lost the race for Golden Glove to Amrinder. For India duty, though, Gurpreet said his previous form hardly matters. “I think like everyone says, you are as good as your last training session,” Gurpreet told TOI during an online interaction on Sunday. “I am as good as I did yesterday. What I did in the ISL, the seasons before, the games before for national team does not matter. None of that plays on my head. “Most important for me as a player is to be consistent, show I am available and doing the job correctly. None of the form or games before matter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fear-of-big-teams-has-vanished-gurpreet/articleshow/81740474.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Murder accused does a Spider Man, scales buildings, but cops catch up||HYDERABAD: An undertrial who escaped from the clutches of escort cops gambled his way to freedom, perhaps taking inspiration from Spider Man on how to scale buildings. Straight out of an action film, the murder accused jumped from one building to another in his bid to escape from the chasing cops. For nearly one hour, the hide-and-seek play went on before the long arm of the law caught up with remand prisoner Mangali Naresh in Sangareddy town. With police hot on his trail and closing in on him, Naresh managed to outwit them. When the Blue Colts team and Rakshak vehicle almost zeroed in on him, Naresh again managed to escape from the spot. Naresh on the run chanced upon a cellar of a building. He felt it could be a safe hideout for him while the cops would be out on the roads searching for him. However, the ‘cooling period’ in the cellar did not last long. Soon, police teams cornered him and took him into custody. “All the while, our teams were tracking him and his movements,” Sangareddy police inspector Ramesh told STOI. “As soon as the escort personnel gave us information about his escape from their custody, the teams were despatched in a Rakshak vehicle and a Blue Colts team was sent to go after the prisoner and catch him,” Ramesh said. The drama began at the Sangareddy district court. The escort police brought Naresh from Cherlapally Central Prison to produce him in the court in a murder case trial. Naresh, a resident of Gopinagar at Chandanagar in Hyderabad, was arrested in connection with a murder at Patancheru in 2017. After the court hearing, the prisoner told the cops that he wanted to attend nature’s call. He was allowed to use the toilet at the bus station as the escort team was waiting for a bus to take him back to Cherlapally jail. The toilet had no roof. Naresh made good of his escape by jumping out of it. The escort team tried to catch him but in vain. “For trying to escape, we booked a case against him for which he can be punished for up to two years in jail,” Sangareddy police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/murder-accused-does-a-spider-man-scales-buildings-but-cops-catch-up/articleshow/81728152.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The issue of the tree lying in the path of the road widening came to the fore after local environmentalist Amit Saini raised the issue before the local administration, which had razed two religious structures from the same spot in October last year for the widening of NH-74. On request from the locals, the administration agreed to rebuild the same structures elsewhere. Saini requested the officials to find a similar alternate way to keep the tree alive as well. Soon after, Bazpur SDM AP Vajpayee directed the PWD and power department to transplant the tree. Four months later, the tree is now transplanted 4 km away from the original site. Vajpayee said that it was a task which needed "devotion and a lot of paperwork." "Like the temple and mosque, the tree was also falling and had to be removed. It is good that we were able to have it transplanted," he said. Meanwhile, Saini told TOI, "This is a 40-year-old tree. I thank the local administration and forest department for taking up the initiative to ensure transplantation of the tree which has both ecological and religious significance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/to-save-it-from-being-cut-for-road-widening-project-peepal-tree-translocated-in-us-nagar/articleshow/81727565.cms||Aakash Ahuja

---||Delhi||Clean 200 waterbodies before monsoon: Delhi minister||NEW DELHI: Delhi Jal Board chairman and water minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday conducted a meeting to review the situation of 600 waterbodies, including lakes, in the national capital. He directed the officials concerned to clean all waterbodies on priority. At least 200 out of these 600 waterbodies must be cleaned before monsoon, he asserted. Jain claimed that multiple complaints were made by the public that waste mismanagement by municipal bodies had converted these waterbodies into dumping grounds. To get the desired quantity of water to the Paschim Vihar lake area and other green belts, the minister ordered that a dedicated pipeline be laid from Keshopur sewage treatment plant. The forest near Shakurpur railway station will be supplied with treated water from Mangolpuri common effluent treatment plant. “Treated water from the Keshopur plant will also be used for groundwater recharge in 200 acres of the green area across the Najafgarh drain,” he said. Jain reviewed the progress of work of Iradat Nagar Lake and Najafgarh Lake too. He directed that DJB should complete the Najafgarh Lake rejuvenation project and develop a polishing pond to improve the incoming 5 MGD of water from the Najafgarh STP using natural wetlands and aeration. “Sludge generated from this STP will be used in Pappankalan STP, where surplus capacity of treatment is available. This will result in a saving of Rs 30 crore,” Jain claimed. The minister also instructed to create two more lakes at Pappankalan STP. It will then have three lakes spread over an area of 25 acres. These lakes will be used for polishing 40 MGD of water coming from the STP. Maximum water will be used for groundwater recharge and horticulture, officials say. Rainwater can also be collected in waterbodies, if they are clean, said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/clean-200-waterbodies-before-monsoon-jain/articleshow/81728613.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Register Indu flats in owners’ names, HC tells housing board||Hyderabad: In a judgment that can bring cheer to scores of home-buyers who invested in the Indu Aranya Pallavi project, in Bandlaguda, Justice T Amarnath Goud of the Telangana high court has directed the state housing board to register flats in the name of the buyers, who’ve paid the entire consideration, and deliver the properties to them. The project was taken up as a joint venture between the housing board and Indu Projects, on an area spread over 50 acres, at Thattiannaram near Bandlaguda a decade ago. Indu took up the project through its subsidiary, Indu Eastern Province Ltd. While petitioners B Venugopal Reddy, B Chandrasekhar, and 24 others paid the full amount for the flats by 2009 itself, they weren’t given properties. The developer failed to perform his duty and the housing board too was rendered helpless because the project was caught in legal wrangles following registration of cases by CBI against Indu Projects in the quid pro quo case involving AP Chief Minister, Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy. Shyam Prasad Reddy, the Indu group promoter was made an accused in three charge sheets. As a result, the registration of flats in favour of the buyers could not be completed. Aggrieved by the inordinate delay, home-buyers approached the high court and sought registration of flats in their name. According to Rajasekhar Rao Salvaji, the counsel for one batch of petitioners, customers paid Rs 22.38 lakh per flat in 2009 and entered into sale agreements with the developer and the housing board. The judge in his order said that the housing board officials initially came forward to register the flats if the flat buyers agreed to bear the registration costs. Though the buyers were ready for this, housing board officials later backtracked. Additional advocate general argued that since the matter was referred to the arbitration process, flats buyers should wait for the outcome of the process. Maintaining that buyers have nothing to do with the arbitration and should not be dragged into it, the judge said that Indu group and the housing board should resolve their issues among themselves. Since customers had paid the full consideration, they are entitled to get their flats, the judge said asking the housing board to complete registration of their houses within one week. While of cost of registration will be borne by customers, the judge directed the board to pay Rs 10,000 to each petitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/register-indu-flats-in-owners-names-hc-tells-housing-board/articleshow/81728175.cms||---

The police have arrested Vidit Sharma (20), son of financier Deepak Sharma, whose house was robbed. He was arrested for hatching the robbery with his two friends to repay the debt due to loss of money he incurred in cryptocurrency and online gaming. Police said that irregular statements of Vidit, who was the sole witness for the police in the robbery in broad daylight, raised doubts over his conduct. “Vidit told us that three persons entered the house in the afternoon. They showed him ID cards at the entrance. It comes contrary to the CCTV footage which shows two persons entering the house. He was found to be very calm, composed and casual during questioning indicating that he is hiding something,” said Digant Anand, DCP (Crime), Jaipur Commissionerate. Another clue, which left police for sure to take Vidit as the main suspect in the case, is CCTV footage which shows that both the robbers directly entered the house without even checking the house number or reading the nameplate. Deputy commissioner of Police, Jaipur City (East), Police Commissionerate, Abhijeet Singh, said he has lost huge money in bitcoins and online gaming. The estimate by the police show that he has to repay Rs 15 lakh to his father, relatives, friends and repay the loan. “He confessed to have taken money from his father, friends, cousin brother and a loan from the bank. His family was aware of his investment business is the reason that his mother helped him in getting a loan from a private bank. He took Rs 1.5 lakh from his cousin brother in Agra, another Rs 1.5 lakh from his friends and from his father as well,” said Singh. He was under the pressure to repay the sum and hatched the conspiracy. “The other accomplice in the crime has been identified as his friends and soon they will be under the police custody,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/financiers-son-held-for-hatching-plan-to-loot-rs-22l/articleshow/81728162.cms||---

These include unclaimed bodies, suicides, drownings, self-accidents and other cases. From 2017 till February 2021, over 7,500 unnatural death cases have been registered in the state. A senior officer said that any person who dies under various circumstances, and when doctors are unable to provide the cause of death, such cases are converted into unnatural death. Most of the unnatural death cases are registered in Mapusa, Calangute, Margao and Ponda.  A senior officer said that most of the cases that have been recorded as unnatural deaths arise out of accidents and suicides. The officer said that many of these deaths are of men aged between 30 and 60, who have committed suicide due to stress, financial constraints, and personal relationships. He said that most of the cases are reported in urban areas as migrant labourers come to Goa in search of jobs and tend to sleep on the footpaths, in gardens or open spaces, and are later found dead. “When the cause of death is not known, police register it an unnatural death,” the officer said. Police have registered many unnatural deaths of foreign nationals who are found dead in their rooms or open spaces. After their family members pressed for an investigation, some of those were later converted into murder cases. Last month, a case of unnatural death of a Nigerian national was registered by Anjuna police after he was suspected to have died of drug overdose. Police said that around 5.30am on Saturday, a taxi driver halted his vehicle for help near a restaurant after his Nigerian passenger had turned violent. Thereafter, the restaurant staff called the police to the spot. In the case involving British teenager Scarlett Keeling at Anjuna beach, police initially registered it as an unnatural death but later converted it into murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cops-over-7500-unnatural-deaths-reported-since-17/articleshow/81729088.cms||Murari Shetye

Environmentalists alleged that influential operators are hand in glove with forest staff and risking the life of tourists in wildlife sanctuary. Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR), local advisory committee member, Tapeshwar Singh Bhati alleged, “There is a pictorial evidence that this week a woman was driving a boat. However, there is no registered woman driver with the forest department. Moreover, no person in the boat, including a man with operator, was caught not wearing safety jackets, thus violating the safari norms,” he said. According to a forest official, “The operator had gone to take trial of the boat to check the mechanical fault. But, standing inside the boat without life jackets is a violation. Moreover, taking tourists inside without paying the entry fee is illegal. Also, it’s a revenue loss for forest department,” he said. Many boat operators alleged that influential operators are violating the norms as they are shielded by the forest officials. Puran Yaduvanshi, a boat operator, said, “On March 27, one boat operator broke the roaster and went for a safari out of turn. The forest staff deployed for monitoring should be transferred at the earliest as they take kickbacks and protect the influential operators,” he said. Sedu Ram Yadav, chief conservator of forest, MHTR, Kota, said , “We have sought a report on this matter from the staff. Prima facie , investigation says operator was checking the fault and did not take far inside the sanctuary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/boat-operators-flout-safari-norms-at-chambal-sanctuary/articleshow/81728179.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rooftop solar project fails to take off at Jaipur Metro||JAIPUR: Despite initiating twice, the project to make Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JMRC) self-sufficient in energy by installing rooftop solar plants, failed to take off in absence of the state government’s will. The project could have given a breather to the JMRC, a loss making entity, which spends Rs 80 lakh per month. The first time, the JMRC decided to set up rooftop solar panels at eight elevated stations along the 9.25km-long corridor between Mansarovar and Chandpole under the central government scheme. However, the project did not receive approval from the Rajasthan government. A source said, “The JMRC had earlier requested the Centre to install 2,500 KWP rooftop solar power plants at Metro stations. The Centre had approved the project. However, the proposal failed to take off as the state government failed to give permission,” said a JMRC official. If the project is implemented, it would become the biggest solar plant installed on any government building in the state. The power generated by 2,500 KWP rooftop solar power plants was expected to meet all the requirements of Metro stations during the day and reduce its dependence on non-renewable sources. “For all Metro operations, approximately 11 lakh units are required. The rooftop plants would have produced 2.5 lakh units which could have been enough to meet all the requirements of stations during the day,” added the official. Sources claimed that it was a cost-effective model to generate power for the Metro. “The JMRC could have purchased electricity at less cost for the next 25 years. At present, the electricity consumption of one Metro station is approximately 1,200 units per day. The panels would have generated electricity for all daytime operations,” the official said. After shelving the 2,500 KWP, the JMRC plans to install 750 KWP after appointing REEL. However, objection was raised by the finance department. “Before the power purchase agreement could be signed, the finance department sent a letter to JMRC seeking queries. It raised an objection not to take a project,” said source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rooftop-solar-project-fails-to-take-off-at-jaipur-metro/articleshow/81728190.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||A profitable year for city airport||Coimbatore: Just before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the Coimbatore International Airport, which had been making losses, made a profit for the first time.The airport recorded a profit of Rs 23.35 crore in 2019-20, which was also the year it witnessed the highest passenger volume in its history. It became the most profitable airport in the state, leaving Chennai, Trichy, Madurai and Salem airports behind.According to the profits declared by aviation minister Santanu Sen, the Coimbatore airport handled 30 lakh passengers that year. The airport, which recorded a loss of Rs 19.7 crore and Rs 17.53 crore in the previous two years, managed to turn itself around to make a profit of Rs 23.35 crore, higher than Chennai Airport’s profit of Rs 22.65 crore.This is despite Coimbatore’s passenger traffic being hardly 13% of Chennai’s. The profit was higher than that of traditionally profitable smaller airports like Trichy, which recorded Rs 22.85 crore.The numbers also seem to correlate with passenger traffic. Coimbatore’s passenger traffic that year was almost twice that of Trichy, which saw only 15.44 lakh passengers, more than twice that of Madurai, which saw only 13.5 lakh passengers and almost 10 times of Salem. “Our main revenues are from passenger service charges and flight landing charges, which were naturally high because we saw sizeable passenger traffic. As many as 40 flights were landing and taking off, giving us good revenue. Also, we did not have much infrastructure expenses that year,” airport director R Mahalingam said. “More vendors opened stalls and generated more rental income.”The numbers vindicate the stand of frequent fliers, who argued that the airport has the potential to become an alternate to the Chennai airport. “If authorities rapidly expand the airport’s runway and terminals, which have already overshot capacity, and allow more International airlines to operate to cities like Dubai and Kuala Lumpur, the airport will have a booming growth in passengers and cargo,” aviation enthusiast and businessman J Sathish said. Adding infrastructure and international connections will also help to promote tourism and medical tourism in the district, said Aishwarya Arjun, immediate past chair, Young Indians. “The airport would become southern and western regions gateway to the world if authorities upgrade facilities like shopping, restaurants, kiosks to promote tourism and maybe an art gallery to promote local artists, making the visit and wait more enjoyable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/a-profitable-year-for-city-airport/articleshow/81728182.cms||---

The opposition has been gunning for Raut, alleging that he is not focussed enough on Nagpur, which is why the administration was unprepared for the rise in cases. Patole refuted the allegations saying the developing situation is being handled in the best possible way. “Guardian minister Raut is completely dedicated to the district and the situation is being monitored closely,” said Patole. While BJP had been levelling charges against Raut for his absence from the city for political campaigns, Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirmal Sena too raised the same issue on Saturday by staging a protest. On Friday, BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule said Raut should be remain in the collector’s office “for minimum 12-15 hours” a day and coordinate movement of every officer. Replying to all these allegations, Patole said it was impractical of people to demand such a thing. “If the minister keeps calling each and every official then it will create operation hurdles. Things are being handled properly as the bed capacity is being increased and also new (Covid care) centres are being opened,” said Patole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/patole-defends-raut-over-covid-issue/articleshow/81728198.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

These farmers need a strong support system and I have demanded a compensation of Rs 1 lakh per hectare,” Darekar said. Darekar visited parts of the Baglan taluka that have been severely hit by four days of the unseasonal rain and hailstorm between March 20 and 24. Crops in at least 7,800 hectare have been damaged here. Darekar further claimed that the government had become insensitive to the farmers' demands as none of the ministers from Nashik had even visited the famers. “We have agriculture minister Dada Bhuse from Malegaon taluka, which is next to Satana taluka, and we have district guardian minister in Nashik — but neither of them has visited the farmers at a time when it is important to support them mentally,” Darekar said. He said even when the farmers had lost their income, the loan amounts were mounting and the banks were carrying out a recovery drive and auctioning the farms. He also noted that the Maharashtra State ElectricityDistribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) was adamant on snapping the power to the fields. “Nature has already battered the farmers. Some of them have crops that need watering, but that is not possible because the power has been disconnected. The government is not here to make profits. It must immediately provide relief,” said Darekar.To assess the Covid situation, Darekar also visited the civil hospital, met the NMC commissioner and also the collector. He said the NMC was fully prepared to provide better services by enhancing the infrastructure. “We will seek more doses for citizens of Nashik from the state and central governments,” Darekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/darekar-seeks-compensation-of-rs-1l/ha-for-baglan-farmers/articleshow/81727094.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Its local leaders are facing the bitter results of this behaviour of the central government,” it said. “Leaders of BJP and its allies have been inciting the farmers with rhetoric. Due to all this and in the context of opposition to agricultural laws, farmers have been socially boycotting the leaders of BJP and its allies,” morcha added. It also made an appeal to all protesters to remain peaceful and disciplined. “It has been more than four months since farmers have been protesting on borders of Delhi, but the central government has been inhumane and has completely ignored the farmers,” SKM alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/skm-regrets-but-blames-saffron-party/articleshow/81728652.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Punjab CM censures attack on BJP MLA, warns of strict action||CHANDIGARH: Condemning the attack on BJP MLA from Abohar, Arun Narang, allegedly by angry farmers protesting the Centre’s farm laws, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday warned of strict action against anyone trying to disturb the state’s peace by taking the law into their hands. Even as he urged the farmers not to indulge in such acts of violence, the chief minister appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to urgently resolve the crisis triggered by the agriculture marketing laws to prevent the situation from escalating further. Capt Amarinder also directed DGP Dinkar Gupta to take strict action, under the law, against the perpetrators, who also clashed with the police personnel who tried to rescue the MLA. Faridkot SP (headquarters) PPS Gurmail Singh was injured while trying to save and evacuate the MLA from the protesting crowd. He also suffered a lathi blow on his head, causing his turban to fall off. He was admitted to Civil Hospital, Malout, where the incident took place. The DGP later said criminal cases will be registered against the suspects who assaulted the MLA and police officers. He said statements of local BJP leaders were being recorded and relevant sections of law would be imposed on its basis. A number of incidents of protests against BJP leaders were reported from different parts of Punjab on Saturday, added a spokesperson. The chief minister said while protesting was the democratic right of the farmers, violence of any sorts would not be tolerated, and the law and order situation in the state would not be allowed to be disturbed at any cost. He said barring the assault on the BJP MLA, other BJP leaders were safely evacuated from the protest sites. Seeking the Prime Minister’s immediate intervention to resolve the tensions, the chief minister said any further delay on the part of the central government would trigger further unrest among the agitating farmers. Coupled with the increased threat from across the border from Pakistan-backed terrorist outfits, who were already trying to exploit the situation, this could pose a serious security threat to Punjab, and resultantly the entire nation, he warned. Reacting to the demand of Punjab BJP leaders for his resignation over the issue, the chief minister said instead of trying to take political mileage from the incident, they should pressure their central leadership to withdraw the controversial legislations. They should apprise the BJP central leadership of the “genuine anger among the farmers”, which the Government of India has been brushing off as the handiwork of the Congress in Punjab, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amarinder-censures-attack-on-bjp-mla-warns-of-strict-action/articleshow/81728646.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Artists run out of chances as poll campaign moves to digital space||Coimbatore: A look-alike of former chief minister MG Ramachandran, 67-year-old ex-service man MGR Ilango has been a crowd-puller for the AIADMK in election campaign rallies since 1992.In the past, his dates were always full during the election season and it was extremely difficult to track him down, as he was busy moving from a constituency to another. But this time, the demand for artists like him and troupes has dwindled. Ilango has participated only in six functions so far. The story isn’t any different for the likes of him. Much of it could be attributed to the ever-growing reach of digital media platforms and the shorter time span between the announcement of poll dates and the poll day.Pragatheeswaran, a member of Pudukai Poobalam arts troupe, said, “For us, this election is completely different. Due to lack of sufficient time, we could not plan our schedule properly. The number of invites we have received is also fewer than the previous years, as many candidates have turned to digital media platforms.”Pointing out that the number of political satires being performed during election campaigns has been coming down every year because of several restrictions, he said they hadn’t performed any satires this time. “Our involvement in the campaigns is limited just to dancing and singing. The campaign started hardly 10 days ago and only as many days are left to conclude the same.” On their part, many candidates have found social media platforms much cheaper. “While they have to shell out anywhere between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000 to hire 10-15 artists for their campaigns, they have to spend only Rs 5,000 to reach a wider audience on social media,” said PV Shanmugam, a stage artist. The number of invites that he received to perform this year has come down by 60%. “Many artists are not ready to travel outstation, as it is impossible to manage all the expenses with just Rs1,000 per day.” S Ajithraja, president, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry Stage Dancers’ Association, said they were all seasonal workers. “We usually get chances to perform only from January to June every year, thanks to temple festivals. But this year, temple festivals were cancelled because of the election. Only look-alikes of political leaders and dancers are in demand for election campaigns. The livelihood of others is at stake.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/artists-run-out-of-chances-as-poll-campaign-moves-to-digital-space/articleshow/81728194.cms||Nivedha Selvam
---||Coimbatore||Pvt hospital performs awake brain surgery to remove tumour||Coimbatore: A city hospital performed an awake brain surgery, also known as awake craniotomy, on a 42-year-old patient to remove tumour from the brain’s broca area in the left frontal lobe that deals with functions related to speech function.An awake brain surgery is a type of procedure performed on the brain while the patient is awake and alert. The main benefit is that it helps ensure that speech and limb movements are not affected.Dr K Madeswaran, chairman and neurosurgeon of Royal Care Hospital, which performed the surgery, said, “It is not a new technique, but it is rarely done.”He said the patient, Muruganandham, had to quit his job as a minibus conductor eight years ago as he started to have frequent seizures, which medicines could not control.An MRI detected a tumour in the speech area of the brain. “There was a risk that routine surgical methods could affect his ability to speak, as there is always a chance of disturbing or removing a portion of an important area in the brain during the procedure. Hence, we decided to perform the awake craniotomy,” Madeswaran said.Doctors gave him a local anaesthesia to cut open his skull and mild sedation, as the brain’s dura matter is pain sensitive. “The brain is not sensitive to pain, so we could operate inside it without full sedation,” the surgeon said.Muruganandham confirmed that there was no pain. “While my family was apprehensive about the surgery, I was not scared. During the surgery I felt nothing, besides the injection. I am speaking more clearly after the surgery.”The surgery lasted for three hours, throughout which the patient was conversing - answering questions from the doctors and staff - and moving a few limbs. “We kept watching for speech disturbances while removing the tumour. Now, he is ready for discharge,” Madeswaran said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/pvt-hospital-performs-awake-brain-surgery-to-remove-tumour/articleshow/81728195.cms||---

In what is being called ‘Vedic Holi’, the Shivashakti Temple in Sector-7 in Gandhinagar is geared up for this new avatar of Holika Dahan. To be held in a grand manner at around 7.30pm on Sunday, about three tonnes of cowdung will be used to make ‘gobar sticks’ and together the Holika Dahan or lightning of the Holi pyre will be carried out, said sources aware of the development. The process of making the sticks has been around for several years, but this eco-friendly product wasn’t very popular earlier. Now the demand for ‘gobar sticks’ is slowly picking up due to environmental concerns. The cow dung will come from a nearby gau shala or cow shelter in Gandhinagar, the source said. This year, the state government has put restrictions on Holi and Dhuleti celebrations in the state due to the increasing Covid-19 cases. The lighting of the Holi pyre will be allowed according to Covid-19 rules laid down and under police vigilance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vedic-holi-at-shivshakti-temple-in-gandhinagar/articleshow/81728206.cms||---
---||Bareilly||‘Budaun re-run’: Pilibhit MP Varun Gandhi writes to DGP for fair probe in murder of two sisters||PLIBHIT: BJP MP from Pilibhit, Varun Gandhi, on Saturday shot a letter to the director-general of police of Uttar Pradesh and appealed for a "fair investigation" and "justice" in the murder of two sisters -- aged 18 and 20 -- in Jasoli village under Bisalpur Kotwali police station on March 22. Gandhi wrote that he was informed about the incident by villagers of the family’s native place, Bilaspur, in Bilsanda, and sought his intervention in the matter. Talking to TOI, Gandhi said, “This is an extremely horrifying and tragic case and I have impressed upon the district administration the need to urgently deliver justice. The facts are not easy to dissect because there are two different versions of what happened or what could have happened. I have asked them to immediately reinvestigate the matter. The new superintendent of police has joined, in Pilibhit, and I would request him to make this case a priority. I will keep an eye on this case and ensure justice is delivered.” Police have claimed it to be a case of honour killing and have booked the mother and two brothers, along with two others, for "concealing evidence". Locals in Bilaspur village, however, told TOI that the family members are innocent and framed by police. None of the brothers have any criminal history. The elder brother was collecting money for his sister’s marriage for the past few months. Some villagers visited the MP’s office recently and informed that the family members were wrongly implicated in the murders and the actual culprits were not arrested. Earlier, in a complaint to police, the girls’ younger brother had alleged that the brick kiln owner, the manager and the contractor had coerced his elder sister into physical relationships with them. The then Pilibhit SP had told TOI that the family had given this new complaint hours after the FIR was registered. “They would rape her. On that night, my younger sister saw the three of them in a compromising situation. The accused strangled her, afraid she would spill the beans. Then, they hanged my elder sister from a tree to destroy all evidence,” the complaint said. The FIR, however, does not mention any of this. It charges an unidentified person with murder and causing disappearance of evidence, and includes a complaint which says how the girls went missing and were found dead. “Police didn’t register the FIR on the basis of the complaint we filed,” the girls’ sister-in-law had earlier told TOI. Ironically, contractor Ramdas, who was mentioned as an accused by the family, was made an eyewitness in the case. A neighbour of the family in Bilaspur village told TOI, “Sharing the facts, which were mentioned in the complaint by the family, was not easy. How can police make them accused just by recovering a sickle from an open house? The sickle was not even used in the murder. The sister-in-law of the girls is still scared after the assault by women constables. The family is very poor and can’t even hire a good advocate.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/budaun-re-run-pilibhit-mp-varun-gandhi-writes-to-dgp-for-fair-probe-in-murder-of-two-sisters/articleshow/81727095.cms||Keshav Agarwal
---||Ahmedabad||Mudra loan NPAs up by 8% in Q3||Ahmedabad: As the pandemic-induced lockdown and slowdown affected revenues of small businesses, non-performing assets (NPAs) amongs loans extended under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) rose by 8% in the quarter that ended on December 31, 2020, against the corresponding quarter of the previous year. NPAs went from Rs 526.32 crore to Rs 567.9 crore during this period, according to the latest report of the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), Gujarat.Fresh disbursals also took a hit, showing a 10% decline from Rs 11,326 crore in Dec 2019 to Rs 10,243 crore in Dec 2020. Bankers said the decline in fresh disbursals was primarily due to liquidity crisis faced by smaller businesses due to which expansion projects came to a halt. Most people who avail of Mudra loans are micro and small enterprises and businesses, which were not under the ambit of mainstream banks.Banking sector sources said slowing disbursals and growing NPAs are a function of weakening repayment capacity of small businesses, especially after the lockdown. “Most businesses have failed to repay loans due to shrinking revenues after the lockdown. As a consequence, not just fresh disbursals but also repayments of loans under PMMY were impacted,” said a source.Industry sources said several small businesses shut down after the lockdown or were struggling for revenue due to decline in demand. “The plight of small businesses was bad even before the lockdown. This worsened after the lockdown when sources of income dried up. This is especially true for small-time retailers and restaurant owners, and others in the services sector. Consequently, plans for expansion stalled, bringing fresh demand for credit to a halt,” said Chintan Thaker, chairman, Assocham Gujarat State Council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mudra-loan-npas-up-by-8-in-q3/articleshow/81728215.cms||Niyati Parikh

The case of Vidit Sharma staging a robbery in his house to repay the debt due to loss in cryptocurrency and online gaming is just one example of how youths from educated families are resorting to illegal means due to pressure of debt from online gaming. Jaipur police have recorded several cases in the recent past in which parents have ended up losing money from their debit or credit cards. “A woman registered a case of online fraud involving Rs 25,000 at cyber cell last year. Our investigation revealed that her minor children used the money for PubG in-gaming purchase. Similarly, a man registered a case of losing Rs 1.5 lakh from his bank account. The investigation in both cases revealed that the purchase was made using the victim’s internet connection by their wards. Later, the parents dropped the complaints,” said Mukesh Choudhary, cyber crime consultant to Jaipur police. The robbery of Rs 45 lakh from the hawala businessman at Khunteto ka Rasta under the Kotwali police station this month was carried out to repay the debt the accused were in. The accused had lost money in several businesses including online betting as well. Sharma’s case is not identical but the situation is similar. “The case of Vidit Sharma, the crime could have been averted had his debts were known to his parents or if he was given proper counselling by parents, relatives or friends. Such incidents need wide attention from society wherein parents need to monitor the behavioural changes in the adolescents and kids, especially their screen time,” deputy commissioner of police, Jaipur City (east), police commissionerate, Abhijeet Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/crime-among-city-youths-due-to-online-gaming-a-concern-cops/articleshow/81728208.cms||---

Delhi Police has booked the four men for causing death due to negligence. Lokesh Kumar and Prem Chand, who worked as waiters during functions at different banquet halls, had died on Thursday night after they were called to Pearl Grand Emperor banquet hall in Patparganj Industrial Area to clean a septic tank. After about two hours, both of them were found lying unconscious in the tank. They were pulled out and were taken to a hospital where they were declared dead. During investigation, police found that the housekeeping in-charge, Rahul, knew Kumar as they are distant relatives. “It was on Rahul’s call that Kumar took Prem Chand to the banquet hall where they were asked to clean the tank. They had been promised a total sum of Rs 3,000,” said a police officer. Deputy commissioner of police (east) Deepak Yadav said that the four arrested men included Rahul, Amir Khan, Jimmy Arora and Girish. Arora and Girish are directors of a firm, which runs the banquet hall, while Khan is the manager. “They have all been booked under IPC Section 304A for causing death due to negligence, under Section 9 of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavenger and Their Rehabilitation Act and under SC ST Act,” Yadav said. Police said Kumar used to live with his wife and two children, a daughter aged 15 years and a son aged 12. He is also survived by his parents and four brothers who live in Shimla. Prem Chand has left behind his wife and two sons, aged 16 and 12. Amit, Kumar’s cousin, also said that he knew Rahul. “Kumar and Prem Chand used to work as waiters and cleaners at parties. They did not have any prior experience of cleaning a septic tank. They were both threatened that if they do not clean the tank they will not be paid,” the cousin alleged. Earlier on Friday, Delhi sanitation workers’ union members and family members and relatives of the deceased had demanded strict action against the banquet hall owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/four-arrested-for-septic-tank-deaths/articleshow/81728673.cms||---

Police said that the resident of Majhola had lodged a complaint last September and the case was being probed by Jayantipur police. The woman, in her recent complaint to Moradabad SSP, had accused the cop of inaction while also alleging that he demanded Rs 20,000 bribe for “investigating” the matter. A purported audio clip of the conversation between the complainant and the cop was produced before the SSP following which a probe was ordered. The SSP suspended the SI, identified as Narendra Singh, on Friday, and a case has been registered. “We maintain zero tolerance against corruption. Legal action has been initiated against the SI who allegedly sought bribe for performing his duty. The SI has been suspended,” Prabhakar Chaudhary, the Moradabad SSP, said.

DEFB is an export incentive scheme. Key accused Snehalata Jaiswal, was sentenced to three years imprisonment and fined Rs 3.80 crore. KMP Syntex Pvt Ltd, the firm where Snehalata was a director, was separately fined Rs 3 lakh. Special CBI judge SU Wadgaonkar also directed that the amount lying in Snehalata’s account in Central Bank of India is to be credited to the government at the end of the appeal period. Snehalata’s husband, Samdarshi Jaiswal, prime accused, died during pendency of trial and the case against him was abated. Special public prosecutor Jitendra K Sharma cited evidence of over 50 witnesses to seek conviction. While three others — Ramesh Singh, Kiran Cheulkar and Pradeep Sanghavi — were handed 2-year sentences and fined Rs 4.50 lakh each, the fifth accused, Suresh Kumar Jain, was sentenced to 1 year rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs 3 lakh. Sentencing the accused, the court held that economic offences have serious consequences on the country’s financial health. “Evidence on record indicates that at every stage while obtaining, transfer, utilisation of DEPB Scrips, fraud is committed, thereby Rs 4 crore loss is caused to the government in 1998. Since then, near about 23 years have passed. If the same amount were deposited in the bank, the amount would get for a value of over Rs 25 crore,” the special judge said. In July last year, another accused in the case, Abhinav Singh (54), a former Customs appraising officer, who was absconding for 20 years, was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment and fined Rs 9 lakh. The accused was arrested from Mathura, where he was an associate professor at a medical college, hospital and research centre. He had allegedly secured the job on the basis of forged documents. He was tried separately. On September 21, 1999, the case was registered by CBI, Economic Offences Wing. It was alleged that the accused, in collusion with Abhinav Singh, obtained 18 DEPB scrips from the office of the joint director general of foreign trade in Mumbai and New Delhi, for duty-free import in the names of four fake firms. Proceeds of crime were allegedly used by the Jaiswals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-22-years-after-rs-5cr-customs-con-3-yrs-jail-for-co-director/articleshow/81728685.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Doctors need to test such at-risk subjects with gastrointestinal manifestations rather than waiting for pulmonary complaints to appear. This will allow in prompt detection of Covid,” says the study ‘Hepatic and gastrointestinal manifestation of Covid-19,’ which was also published in a journal last month. The study was conducted by doctors of department of gastroenterology, SMS Medical College including Dr Sudhir Maharshi, Dr KK Sharma and Dr SS Sharma. “Covid-19 involves mainly the respiratory system, but other organs such as heart, kidney, liver and intestine may also be affected. Major hepatic and gastrointestinal manifestations include elevation of liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea,” says the study. “Covid patients without gastrointestinal complaints have higher cure rate and discharge (60% versus 34.3%) compared to those with stomach bug. This is likely because of viral multiplication in the gastrointestinal tract re-sulting in severe disease,” said Dr Maharshi, quoting multiple studies on the symptoms of Covid. SMS Hospital’s review article further stated that one study showed that nausea along with vomiting and diarrhoea were reported in 5.6% and 3.8% patients, respectively. Another cross-sectional study on 204 Covid patients from Hubei reported that 99 (48.5%) patients came to hospital with gastrointestinal manifestations as main symptoms including 7 patients who did not have any pulmonary complaints. These early reports on Covid patients warn gastroenterologists to suspect Covid in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms rather than waiting for pulmonary complaints to come, says the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/diarrhoea-vomiting-can-be-covid-symptoms-study/articleshow/81728224.cms||---

Speaking on the matter, CM Rawat said, “From the very first day, I have been extremely clear that corruption will not be tolerated and those involved in such acts will be punished.

---||Ahmedabad||Hit wicket for betting racket||Ahmedabad: The city police have arrested two persons for delivering live commentary from the Narendra Modi Stadium during an India-England T20 clash — the feed of the duo was intel for a betting racket. Their commentary was relayed through cellphones a few seconds earlier than the TV broadcast. The tiny time difference is a huge advantage for the betting racketeers. The city police arrested the two during the fifth and final T20 match played on March 20. The accused are Haryana residents Prince Sunilkumar Gambhir, 21, from Panipat; and Ashish Birendra Yadav, 26, from Rewari. Additional commissioner of police R V Asari said on Saturday that during the final T20 match, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) officials and police personnel noticed the two constantly talking on their phones. The two were detained. During the interrogation it emerged that the information on the unfolding play was being passed on to several people, including two who were staying at a city hotel. Asari said that websites such as diamondexch were being used for the racket. Prince was speaking to Sumit Ramesh Kumar Bareja and Jatin Baja who were staying at the city hotel. Ashish was conveying his reports to Rocky Subhashchandra Yadav, Sanjivkumar Chawsinh, and Sacchidanand Surendrasinh. The last three T20 matches were played without spectators because of Covid. So to enter the stadium, the two had acquired vendor passes of the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA).  “The investigation has begun, and we believe a large number of people were involved in the racket,” Asari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hit-wicket-for-betting-racket/articleshow/81728223.cms||---

---||Jaipur||New policy to ensure transfers in a time-bound manner, abolish ‘desire system’||JAIPUR: The state government will be introducing a new transfer policy, under which the transfers in all departments will be done in a time-bound manner and it will abolish the ‘desire system’. The administrative reforms department (ARD) has sought suggestions from all government departments to prepare a draft of the policy. Once transferred to a new place/department, an employee cannot seek a transfer for two years. “Under the new transfer policy, transfers will be made time-bound and the entire process will be become online. This is a big policy change that we are going to introduce. It will be a transparent process under which all the departments will list out vacancies in respective departments. The employees working under all departments can apply for transfers up to a certain time-period, mentioning a posting of their choice,” said Ashwini Bhagat, principal secretary, administrative and reforms and coordination. “Following this, there will be counselling for these employees by the departments. It will be a time-bound process. The employees will get 15-30 days to apply for a transfer. An employee will be eligible for a transfer only after completion of two years at one post. After the counselling, the department will issue a transfer list. We’re still in formative stages and seeking suggestions from all the departments,” he added. A fixed time-period for transfers will also be worked out, for example, it could be held from April 1 to June 30. In that case, the departments will have to put up the number of vacancies on their websites or notice board by March 15. The employees will have to submit their applications by March 31. He said priorities will be given to persons with disabilities (PwDs), widows, ex-servicemen in various categories of transfers. “Once the policy is introduced, all departments will transfer their employees as per the provisions of the policy. A simplified procedure of transferring employees will clear all misconceptions about transfers in the state,” said Bhagat. With the introduction of the policy, the desire system will be abolished in transfers; the government will not be able to transfer a person before three years of completion at a post; an employee will not be able to apply for a transfer before two years of completion at a post; no employee will be able to continue in one post for more than five years; transfers will happen through counselling. Priorities will also be given to abandoned persons, sportspersons, spouses (could be given posting in one place), persons with terminal diseases and dependents of martyrs, award-winning teachers. A complaint with regard to a transfer will be resolved within 45 days of submitting an application, provided the employee joins the new post. With one year left of retirement, the person will not be transferred. The policy is not likely to be applicable to the employees of the secretariat, Governor’s secretariat, assembly secretariat, police department, home defence and home guard employees with uniform. Presently, transfer policy exists in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/new-policy-to-ensure-transfers-in-a-time-bound-manner-abolish-desire-system/articleshow/81728212.cms||---

Anoop Nautiyal, member of Social Development for Communities Foundation, an organisation closely tracking the Covid-19 scenario in the Himalayan state, said, “Why are we not testing a large number of people for Covid-19 in Haridwar?

Farmers take on BJP leaders wherever they get to know about any of them attending a political or social event. A day after laying siege to a hotel in Bathinda where former minister Surjit Kumar Jyani had gone to launch an attack on the state government, farmers laid siege to the PWD Rest House in Barnala, where BJP state vice-president Parveen Bansal had gone to address a press conference. Hundreds of activists of farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) sat on the road and raised slogans against the Narendra Modi government. Later, activists of other farm organisations also reached the spot. Speaking to mediapersons inside the rest house, Parveen Bansal said the farm laws were in favour of farmers, who had been misled by certain forces inimical to peace. Meanwhile, Bansal was allowed to go around 5 pm after he came out and assured that farmers’ demands would be put before the party high command.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-leader-gheraoed-in-barnala/articleshow/81728679.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Rising cases and curbs turn Holi colourless for traders||NAGPUR: The extended restrictions imposed to break the chain of Covid spread have brought economic activities to a grinding halt for traders who were looking to the oncoming Holi festival to add some colours to their businesses. With the Covid’s second wave rearing it’s ugly head, the traders are staring at heavy losses. Also, the late declaration of the restrictions on Holi celebrations has come as the last nail in the coffin dimming the traders’ hope to salvage some business in the last two days. Pointing at the unsold stocks of colours/ gulal, pichkaris, topis, pungis/whistles and gaathis (sugar candy garlands), traders from General Merchants’ Association (GMA) said around 350-400 of their members have suffered losses of over Rs5 crore this year. Ashok Sanghvi, former secretary of GMA, said the decrease in Covid cases in December last year has deceived traders as it seems now that it was lull before the storm. “As Diwali passed off considerably well and the Covid cases dipped in December, traders started stocking up for the marriage season and also for the festival of Holi,” he said. “The Covid’s return first took the toll on the marriage season, which was curtailed to avert such events turning into super spreaders. Even as the trading community was yet to recover from the blow, the fresh curbs on Holi celebrations have hit the sentiments,” said Sanghvi. The traders would now be compelled to hold back the inventory for at least one more year. “It’s triple blow for the traders. First, the goods did not sell, but the traders would have to pay to the suppliers. Secondly, some of us would have to pay rent of the godown to store the stocks. Thirdly, most of the products like gaathis, gulal, colours etc kept in sacks will be damaged and will have to be discarded,” said Sanghvi, adding most of the customers have got diverted to Akola, Yavatmal, Amravati and Gondia where the restrictions are far more liberal. “Small traders from Dhobi Talao area, who made caps and whistles etc from paperboard, too have been left with nothing,” he said. Sanjay Tabutwala, secretary of GMA, said the government should have ensured proper planning for keeping the roads de-congested curbing the spread of Covid and speeded up the vaccination drive so that the need for harsh curbs would have been eliminated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rising-cases-and-curbs-turn-holi-colourless-for-traders/articleshow/81728668.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Delhi||BJP demands Rs 10 lakh, job for kin of each dead man||NEW DELHI: Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri on Saturday said the death of two workers while cleaning sewers in Patparganj area of est Delhi was very unfortunate and demanded Rs 10 lakh each as compensation to the dependent of those killed. Delhi government should immediately announce a compensation of Rs 10 lakh each to the kith and kin of the deceased and one member of the family should be given a government job, Bidhuri stated in a letter to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. It is shameful and regretful that manual cleaning of sewers has not been eliminated yet, he wrote. In the letter, he pointed out that in the recent past, there has been a spate of incidents involving manual cleaning of sewer lines and septic tanks that have led to death of poor workers. Bidhuri attacked the Delhi government over such incidents, saying that “it has not done anything.” “The government had announced that it would provide safety kits to the workers who were involved in sewer cleaning, but that has also remained on paper. Those killed in the Patparganj incident while cleaning the septic tank did not have adequate safety kits or machines to help them,” Bidhuri claimed. He urged the CM to immediately stop any kind of manual cleaning of sewers and take strict action against those involved in it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-demands-rs-10-lakh-job-for-kin-of-each-dead-man/articleshow/81728686.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Govt has started perceiving every aandolankari as its enemy but Matri Sadan is just fighting for the cause of Ganga, says ‘water man’ Rajendra Singh||DEHRADUN: Water conservationist and environmentalist Rajendra Singh has expressed concern over the ‘laidback attitude’ of both the state and central governments in taking cognisance of the demands of Haridwar-based Matri Sadan seers regarding the conservation of Ganga. The Magsaysay award-winning activist reached Haridwar on Saturday to lend support to the fasting seers of the ashram. “These seers are selfless and their only objective is to protect the rich aqua ecosystem of Ganga. The government needs to clear its stand on the issues they have raised. If we don't take necessary steps, we might see another Chamoli-like disaster in Uttarakhand,” said Singh. He added, “It is unfortunate that this government has started perceiving each aandolankari (protester) as its enemy but Matri Sadan is just alerting the government regarding the sad state of Ganga.” Singh also wrote a letter to Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat apprising him of the ‘illegal mining works ongoing along the Ganga’. Talking to TOI, he said, “Crores of rupees have been spent on constructing makeshift bridges, ghats and other temporary facilities for the Kumbh Mela area. Had the government spent this money on Ganga conservation, it would have contributed in strengthening our economy.” Prior to visiting the Matri Sadan, he also met with noted environmentalist Sunderlal Bahuguna. Singh told the nonagenarian activist about the efforts of the fasting seers of Matri Sadan during the meeting. Meanwhile, Shivanand Saraswati, founder of Matri Sadan, who has been on a protest fast, taking only four glasses of water a day, on Saturday announced that he will cut down on the intake of water to two glasses a day. Another Matri Sadan seer Brahmachari Aatmabodhanand, 28-year-old, has been on a hunger strike for more than a month now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-has-started-perceiving-every-aandolankari-as-its-enemy-but-matri-sadan-is-just-fighting-for-the-cause-of-ganga-says-water-man-rajendra-singh/articleshow/81727654.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Mumbai||Congress points to ‘missing DVR’ from Param Bir Singh’s office, asks why no senior cop quizzed||MUMBAI: State Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant on Saturday asked the National Investigation Agency to probe the “disappearance” of the digital video recorder from the Mumbai police commissioner’s office. “It’s a serious matter. The NIA must step in immediately and search for the DVR. Surprisingly, more than a week after NIA took over the probe into placing of explosives near the residence of industrialist Mukesh Mumbai, it has not recorded statements of any of the seniors of suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Waze,” Sawant said. Former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh did not respond on the matter, when contacted. The CDR relates to his tenure in office. Leader of opposition and former CM Devendra Fadnavis said “all the godfathers of Waze have been tense ever since the NIA took over the probe.” Sawant said, “We demand that NIA should first probe Param Bir Singh and check if he was aware about the DVR. If NIA is reluctant to probe, the state home department should step in and initiate a probe into the disappearance of the DVR. On March 10, the DVR of the Mumbai CP’s office was officially taken by the Anti-Terrorism Squad for investigation, but the CP took the view that it was a mistake to hand over the DVR to ATS. It was then taken back from the ATS by a senior official from the CP’s office. The DVR has since been missing.” Sawant alleged that in the DVR, not only Waze but even movement of the Scorpio and Innova was clearly seen. “But NIA is yet to summon any of Waze’s senior officials. The BJP has stopped demanding a probe against Singh as BJP’s aim is to divert attention from the Antilia case and Mansukh Hiran murder case. The goalposts were changed for political reasons,” Sawant claimed. On the allegations that the DVR was missing, Fadnavis said it has a very strong back-up, so even if it is missing or stolen, no one will be able to destroy the record. “Digital footprint is collected at three places, so if the DVR is missing, the data will still be there,” he said. From Singh’s letter, Sawant alleged, it appears he and Waze were hand-in-glove and that Waze was reporting to the Mumbai CP daily at the office despite the fact that he was not his direct boss. “We demand NIA should probe the episode in a transparent manner,” he said. Fadnavis said the entire Waze episode has tarnished the image of the state. “From Singh’s letter, it appears that a full Waze syndicate was operating in the state, which was directly involved in postings and transfers of police officials and mobilizing huge money,” he alleged. On phone-tapping by senior IPS officer Rashmi Shukla, Sawant said that from the report submitted by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, it has been established that she had not given a pen drive to anyone, so the question is from where Fadnavis procured it. “Fadnavis should tender an unconditional apology to the people of Maharashtra for misleading them. Further, he had given false information to the Union home secretary too,” Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/congress-points-to-missing-dvr-from-cps-office-asks-why-no-sr-cop-quizzed-in-mumbai/articleshow/81729163.cms||---

The CP said police would also initiate sweeping raids and combing operations across the city from Saturday late evening. “Given the city’s crime history on Holi eve and during the festival, we are keeping no stones unturned and ensure the city remains safe and crime-free during the period,” he said. The CP has also appeal to the citizens to refrain from participating or organizing any event or festivity which may aggravate the pandemic situation.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Kingpin of interstate gang on the run for 4 months arrested||NEW DELHI: A 49-year-old robber on the run for the past four months has been arrested by Delhi Police’s Crime Branch. Police said the man was a proclaimed offender, with three cases against him in the capital, 16 robbery cases in Jaipur and two snatching cases in Goa. Police said the accused, Naresh Singh, a resident of Sampla in Haryana, was wanted in a case where 4kg gold ornaments were taken from a jeweller in Laxmi Nagar. Singh is the alleged kingpin of a Golu gang that has been behind more than 100 cases of robberies and snatchings in Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Goa. Police said the robbery in Laxmi Nagar took place on December 9 at 6.45am, when four armed men intercepted a three-wheeler at Vikas Marg near Mangal Bazar Road and robbed a jeweler, Champak Gayan, at gunpoint. When Gayan tried to raise an alarm, he was stabbed on the thigh. While the cops arrested two aides who had given the robbers information about the movement of the jeweller, and then three of the robbers by January, Singh managed to evade them. With the arrests, police also seized 1.9 kg of the robbed gold that had been melted into rods. DCP (Crime Branch) Bhisham Singh said, “Following round the clock surveillance on the kingpin, we managed to zero in on his location on Tuesday to Sampala, Haryana and nabbed Singh. On his information, a pistol was also recovered from his rented accommodation in Nangloi.” The accused told police that the robbery plan had been hatched at a hotel in Paharganj four months ago. “He said on the day of robbery when the jeweller left his house with the gold, accused Prashant passed on the information to him and other gang members Pradeep, Mukesh and Shanky,” the DCP said. The four men then followed Gayan, who took an auto to reach Anand Vihar inter-state bus terminal. The four men intercepted his auto, robbed him and fled the spot after stabbing him, the DCP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kingpin-of-interstate-gang-on-the-run-for-4-months-arrested/articleshow/81728693.cms||---

Their performance can be gauged by the fact that out of 2,405 tribal candidates who participated in on-campus recruitment, as many as 2,101 got selected. “This year tribal students from remote areas have really performed well. In the case of non-tribal students, out of 14,793 candidates who participated in the placement process, less than half or only 7,135 got offer letters,” said a senior official of the state education department. They were offered an annual pay package between Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh per annum, according to the official. In the case of Panchmahals district, a stronghold for the tribal community, 700 candidates were selected this year. In Chhota Udepur and Kheda-Mahisagar and Dahod districts, 374, 898, and 574 candidates were selected respectively. Some of the leading companies to participate in the recruitment process include L&T, Reliance Nippon, Tridhya Tech Pvt Ltd, Eleorex, Collabera Services Pvt Ltd, among others. The highest number of recruitments for tribal candidates amounting to almost 50% of the total recruitments has been for BA candidates. This was followed by diploma (15%), BSc (12%), BCom (11%), BE (9%) and BEd (3%). At a time when hiring across the country has been hit due to Covid-19, the state education department’s drive has so far seen 9,236 candidates availing job offers. The campus recruitment began in February and is still underway. Last year, the process was not carried out due to Covid-19 situation when colleges and schools were shut down across the country from March 23 onwards, said sources. Candidates have been shortlisted as graduate trainees in fields like sales, accounts, reception and marketing among others. Offers from service sector including insurance, marketing, banking and sales among others comprised 60% of the placements, while manufacturing sector contributed 40%. The state government has made development of tribal regions one of its top priorities over the past many years, said government sources. Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, who also holds the finance portfolio, recently announced the budget for 2021-22 with special emphasis on development of tribal areas of the state. In what seemed to be an attempt to reach out to 90 lakh tribal population ahead of state elections next year, the minister announced Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojana-2 with a capital outlay of Rs 1 lakh crore for the next five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tribal-students-shine-in-campus-recruitment-drive/articleshow/81728260.cms||---

Raut said his views were in interest of a ‘united opposition’ at the national level and not against any one person. The Sakoli MLA said that this issue won’t end through just statements in the public domain by both parties. “I will be meeting chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and putting our party’s point of view. We cannot accept any person making these type of comments regarding Congress leaders,” said Patole. Raut, a Rajya Sabha MP, expressed surprise over the aggressive reaction by Patole. “Is it a crime to suggest Sharad Pawar’s name?” said Raut, over the phone from New Delhi. “It’s not mandatory to be part of UPA to suggest that the entire opposition needs to be united if they have to take on the BJP,” said Raut. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/raut-has-become-pawars-spokesperson-says-patole-in-mumbai/articleshow/81728711.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Taking a swipe at the change of chief ministers in successive state governments over the past 21 years in Uttarakhand, the farmer leader said, “The state was carved out of Uttar Pradesh with a dream of improving the lives of the farmers and people in the hills. However, the condition of only the politicians and some top officials has improved.” On farmer issues in the Himalayan state, Tikait said, “Farmers should be given subsidies to transport their produce from the treacherous hill tracks to the mandis. The state government must promote village tourism on the lines of Himachal Pradesh. Also, people working towards establishing an IT sector in the hills must be given an allowance.” Tikait also laid stress on the need to ensure that farmers are paid right prices for their produce. “There are nearly 1,800 ghost villages in Uttarakhand. Around 3 lakh hectare farm land has been converted into forest because farmers have left these villages for cities in search of job opportunities. This shows that successive governments have failed terribly in making the right strategy for farmers.” He added that the state government must ensure that farmers, who are impacted due to hydel power projects, are paid compensation timely. Earlier in the day, Tikait was extended a warm welcome in Herbertpur by Daulat Kunwar, national convener of Rashtriya Samvedhanik Adhikar Sanrakshan. In his address, Kunwar said, “If you kill daughters, how will you find daughter-in-laws. Similarly, if you kill farmers, how will you get food?"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-must-bring-back-its-farmers-to-the-hills-through-agri-centric-policies-says-bku-leader-rakesh-tikait/articleshow/81727659.cms||Shivani Azad

According to examination controller Prafulla Sabale, over 95% of eligible students appeared for the examination, of which almost 99% were able to submit their answers. There were 35 examinations held for 37 papers, over three different shifts. The first shift started at 8am, followed by second at 11.30am with the final one at 3pm. Almost 34,000 students logged in with an overwhelming majority using computers rather than smartphones. A server performance analysis said the exam “started with APP servers but switched off one server due to inconsistency. There were two usage spikes today. These issues will be resolved by adding resources to APP server # 1”. Sabale said, “The issues were solely related to internet connectivity. Everything else went off smoothly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-95-attendance-for-nu-exams-on-sat/articleshow/81728266.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

According to exhibition committee secretary V Ramkumar, the district authorities and health officials are insisting that only visitors who have booked through the online system can be allowed to enter the exhibition venue. “This is a totally unviable direction, as most of the people who come to the exhibition are casual visitors who step in by buying entry tickets over the counters. It is difficult to tell them that they must plan their visit in advance and book the tickets earlier,” Ramkumar, who is also one of the leaders of the Thiruvambady temple devaswom committee, said G Rajesh of Paramekkavu devaswom said the district authorities are coming up with new conditions and their aim appears to be derailing the Pooram. The leaders of both the devaswoms abstained from the meeting convened by the collector on Saturday to discuss the smooth conduct of Thrissur Pooram by observing the Covid protocol. However, the district authorities and health officials have clarified that the restrictions are being prescribed in the wake of the reports that the country was heading for another wave of Covid spread. In Thrissur itself, the Covid test positivity rate has gone up from 1.8% to 3.12% in the recent days, they point out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pooram-organizers-threaten-to-cancel-event/articleshow/81728294.cms||---

The letter about amendments in the recruitment rules for the post of Class-1 professors in dental colleges and dental hospitals states that the minimum teaching experience required for teaching faculty has been prescribed in the DCI BDS Course Regulations, 2007 and MDS Regulation, 2017, irrespective of the nomenclature of the teaching post. “The letter, written recently by the council and addressed to the additional health secretary comes after there were complaints of gross irregularities in recruitment of college professors in dental colleges,” said an official aware of the matter. About eight months ago, there were recruitments for the dental colleges in Ahmedabad where the minimum work-experience criteria was overlooked and people who did not qualify for the post, were selected, sources informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dental-council-to-state-extract-irregularities/articleshow/81728282.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Contractor booked for disturbing nesting site||RAJKOT: An offence under the Wildlife Protection Act was registered against a road contractor for disturbing the natural habitat and nesting site of migratory birds slender-billed gulls in the Greater Rann of Kutch near Khavda village of Kutch district on Saturday. Forest department did not reveal the name of the contractor. The contractor had shifted a few hundred eggs of slender-billed gulls, a schedule IV species under the Wildlife Protection Act, about 800 m away from the road construction site to continue work on the 40km stretch of the 255-km Gaduli-Santalpur road. The permission for this road that passes through the Kutch Desert Wildlife Sanctuary and the Wild Ass sanctuary was granted by the National Wildlife Board in 2014. Forest officials said that this gull specie does not usually nest in Kutch, but this year nearly 500 eggs have been laid about 2 km ahead of Khadvand area in Khavda village. Interestingly, the nests were built on the layer of soil laid by the contractor about a year ago for road construction. The road site is currently surrounded by rainwater accumulated in the desert during the monsoon. Assistant conservator of forest Kutch (East) H J Thakkar told TOI: “Primary investigation revealed that the slender-billed gulls have laid nearly 500 eggs out of which the contractor had shifted some of the eggs about 800m away to begin construction work. This constitutes an offence under the Wildlife Protection Act of disturbing natural habitat of protected species.” “As per the contract condition, the contractor has to ensure that there is no harm to the flora and fauna or the environment during the construction work. We are recording the statements of concerned persons and witnesses and thereafter we will register an offence,” Thakkar added. He further said that they had received a complaint that 5,000 eggs of the birds were damaged in the same area. “The contractor is required to inform the forest department before starting construction in the forest area even though he has permission. However, there was no evidence to suggest such large-scale damage. Our team found three damaged eggs and about a dozen carcasses of gull chicks which have been sent for postmortem,” the ACF said. It’s believed that wild dogs may have damaged some of the eggs.

---||Goa||Pratima’s move to AAP is political suicide: Cong||Panaji: Accusing former Mahila Congress president Pratima Coutinho of joining the Aam Aadmi Party for selfish interests, state Congress president Girish Chodankar said that she has committed political suicide by leaving the Congress. “Pratima has still not understood the game of politics,” said Chodankar, stopping short of suggesting that this may have been the reason for keeping the outspoken Mahila Congress worker out of state elections. “In politics, two plus two does not equal four. If she has gone with AAP thinking that the votes she got and the votes AAP got will combine and she will win, that is not the way arithmetic works in politics.” After joining AAP, Coutinho had said that if the votes polled by her and by the AAP candidate were more than the votes in favour of winning candidate Edwin Cardozo, popularly known as Cipru. Cardozo polled 2,895 votes against Coutinho’s 2,523, while AAP candidate Matilda D’Silva got 2,428 votes. Coutinho left the Congress immediately after losing the ZP elections and after a public outburst against Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro. “It is always the individual aspirations and greed that come over the party’s interests. We should work for the party and in the larger interest of Goa,” Chodankar said in a clear reference to Coutinho. Chodankar said that Coutinho’s exit would not hurt the party as many more were joining the party. Former journalist Mahadev Khandekar from Kudne-Sakhali, joined Congress on Saturday. “His joining has strengthened our position in Sakhali. There is a revolt building up in Sakhali and Khandekar will help defeat the chief minister who has become arrogant. There is a strong resolve against the chief minister who is building a fear psychosis in the constituency,” Chodankar said. Khandekar’s entry into Congress spices up the party’s reorganisation efforts in the constituency headed by the chief minister. The party has eight to nine aspiring candidates in Sakhali constituency and will have a tough time selecting the right candidate for the 2022 elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pratimas-move-to-aap-is-political-suicide-cong/articleshow/81729166.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Instead, the vaccination programme will continue on Sunday, which is normally a holiday. The government had rolled out the vaccine for the 60-plus age group and those 45 and above with specified comorbidities on March 1. In all, 607 from the age-appropriate group had taken the jab on the first day in the city. As per the government’s guidelines, they can take the second dose after 28 days. The second dose of these 607 beneficiaries will be due from Monday. Beneficiaries of Covaxin can delay the second dose up to six weeks from the first dose and Covishield up to eight weeks. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said, “Beneficiaries are not required to go to the centre from where they took the first dose for the second one. They have to only ensure that they take the same vaccine.” NMC is yet to plan the programme for the second dose. NMC and Zilla Parishad (ZP) have increased the number of centres in the district from 160 to 192 on Saturday. The NMC increased centres from 74 to 77 in the city. Inoculation started at two NMC’s dispensaries situated at Tajbagh and Dighori in South Nagpur. After getting approval a day ago, Kingsway Hospital started a vaccination centre on Saturday. However, Alexis Hospital, which was the second private hospital not empanelled under the government’s scheme to get approval has stated that as its staff is busy treating a high number of Covid patients, it will not start the vaccination programme now. In all, 6,989 including 4,635 people from age-appropriate group took the jab on Saturday in the city. ZP increased the centres from 86 to 115 in rural parts of the district.

---||Delhi||Delhi court grants partial relief to northeast riot lawyer||NEW DELHI: A city court appointed the youngest counsel present in the courtroom as the local commissioner in the matter pertaining to the seizure of data by Delhi Police from the device of advocate Mehmood Pracha in connection with the allegation of his having tutored a witness in a northeast Delhi riot case. Advocate Avneet Kaur was awaiting her turn in another case on Saturday while the proceedings regarding Pracha’s petition were under way. Upon additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana’s asking who the youngest lawyer in the courtroom was, Kaur stepped forward. She was then appointed the local commissioner in the case and directed to coordinate with the investigating officer and to visit Pracha’s office at noon on Saturday. A local commissioner is an officer of the court who makes local investigations in a case. According to the court, the police would seize and seal the device in question under the local commissioner’s supervision, but it would remain in Pracha’s custody till further orders. Pracha was directed not to tamper with the computer in question. “The entire procedure shall be videographed at the expenses borne by the state,” the court ordered, adding that the local commissioner’s fee was to be paid by Pracha. The court also stayed the chief metropolitan magistrate's order of Friday which had rejected Pracha's plea for modification of an earlier order allowing a search to be carried out by Delhi Police. The prosecution represented by special public prosecutor Amit Prasad and additional public prosecutor Irfan Ahmed and Pracha and his lawyers, including Rudro Chatterjee, had jointly proposed that the “purity and sanctity of the data in question” had to be ensured and a local commissioner should be appointed. Pracha had challenged Friday’s order, which stated that the hands of the investigators couldn’t be tied to prevent them from collecting evidence. He submitted that he was willing to provide the identified computers before the court and the investigating officer could obtain whatever information he wished to and whatever was permitted by the court in the court’s presence. This, his plea pointed out, would curtail “any mischief, and at the same time, ensure that the object of the search warrant is also satisfied”. The chief metropolitan magistrate, however, had ordered the execution of the search warrant in accordance with law. The magistrate observed that Pracha’s offer of the target data in a pen drive could only be considered by the investigation officer if it was admissible in court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-grants-partial-relief-to-ne-riot-lawyer/articleshow/81728723.cms||Aamir Khan

One of the persons injured in the accident, 29-year-old Urvashi Chaudhary, died before reaching the hospital. Police arrested Atul Vekariya, owner of Atul Bakery, for allegedly causing the death of Chaudhary, who works as a clerk at the Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU).

He had no symptoms except mild cold and cough. But as the symptoms got aggravated, we got him tested and the result came positive,” he recounts. “In a matter of days, I along with my wife, my elder brother’s family and my younger son also got infected.” Except Paul, others’ health improved during their isolation but Paul had to take a jab. “I’m feeling better now,” he said on Saturday. It’s not just his household – the third wave has turned the Covid-19 infection into a family affair. Dr Pragnesh Vaccharajani, a city-based physician, said that during the early waves, more than one family members were getting infected, but it was a rarity. “Now we see the cases where four to five members of a family test positive simultaneously or one after the other,” he said. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that a large number of home care patients with several private hospitals are households with multiple patients. “But on the positive side, we are not witnessing many severe cases. I believe that the spread is higher due to milder symptoms that doesn’t alarm the person for 2-3 initial days,” he said. Kalpana Patel, a resident of Gandhinagar, said that her husband got tested after he felt nauseous. “He tested positive. To protect others, he got admitted in hospital. Soon after, all three members – me, my father-in-law and my daughter – also tested positive one after another.

---||Hyderabad||Feathered tales: rare sightings in T||Be it vast forest areas or small marshlands in urban settings, Telangana has an abundant birdlife. With over 500 species living or migrating here, it isn't a surprise that there have been quite a few birds that are newly discovered or rarely sighted in the last few months. Moulika K V identifies some rare birds and easy cues to spot them Blue and white flycatcher Place: Damagundam, Vikarabad Rarely sighted in Telangana, these migratory songbirds with a vivid, electric-blue upper body are reported in parts of India. They are seen mostly in March, when they might be on their spring migration from the wintering grounds in Taiwan, South East China and South East Asia. Famous for their songs, the birds sing mainly at dawn and at dusk. However, the species is usually silent in winter. Bluethroat Place: Manjeera dam, Sangareddy A prize find, this elusive little bird is a rare winter visitor in Telangana. It usually hides in low dense shrubs, but sometimes a male will perch up to sing, or even sing in brief flights above thickets. The song is quite variable because it often includes imitations of other birds. The colourful throat patch of males is prominently shown off in courtship, as well as during aggressive encounters between rivals. Black crowned night heron Place: Mir Alam Tank, Hyderabad Black-crowned Night-Herons are found in wetlands across the Indian sub-continent. In Telangana, you just may have to look a little harder than you do for most birds that depend on wetlands. As the name suggests, these birds do most of their feeding at night and spend much of the day among the branches or think bushes at the water's edge. During their nesting season, the male chooses a nest site in a tree that is usually in a habitat safe from predators and then calls or advertises for a female. Blue-throated blue flycatcher Place: Damagundam, Vikarabad The Blue-throated blue flycatcher, which is a rare Himalayan bird accustomed to cool mountainous climes comes down South towards Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and the Western ghats only in harsh winters. While adult males have blue throats and orange breasts with a well-defined white belly and flanks, female birds have an olive head and upperparts with a poorly defined creamy-orange chest and a white belly. Tickell’s Blue Flycatcher Place: Himayatsagar, Hyderabad This boldly coloured forager is a favourite of birders for its attractive plumage. Slightly larger than Sparrow in size but not as common, this small perching bird is difficult to find in the city. While these birds prefer open perches and are not as shy as other birds that live in the dense scrubs and forest areas, one should have enough patience to get a decent picture as the bird will stay still on a perch only if it feels safe. The name Tickell’s Blue flycatcher commemorates the British ornithologist, Samuel Tickell. Common Shelduck Place: Hussainsagar, Hyderabad Usually found in coastal regions of Europe and scattered sites around the Mediterranean, this solitary bird is so rare that there was no record of its sighting in the online database of bird observers prior to this in Telangana. Probably also sighted for the first time this year, this large goose-like duck with a striking plumage is relatively silent outside the breeding season but they become noisy as they gather in large numbers, especially for moulting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/feathered-tales-rare-sightings-in-t/articleshow/81728762.cms||Moulika.KV

He was replaced by the Zilla Parishad Chief Executive Officer of Amravati Amol Yedge on Friday. Singh took charge as Yavatmal collector on February 15, 2020. His 13 months in office, which coincided with the start of the pandemic, were marred by controversies. He had allegedly insulted health workers, including doctors, who launched an indefinite strike against him after submitting their resignations to the CEO of Yavatmal Zilla Parishad. Revenue officials, including RDC, deputy collectors, SDOs, tehsildars and naib tehsildars too submitted a letter to divisional commissioner Piyush Singh requesting Singh’s transfer. Both the agitations were amicably settled by the then DGM Sanjay Rathod. On March 8, Singh had submitted a confidential report to the divisional commissioner against SP Dr Dilip Bhujbal Patil, ZP CEO Dr Shreekrishna Panchal, civil surgeon Dr Tarangthushar Warey and DHO Dr Hari Pawar. Later, the divisional commissioner had sought explanations from the officers. After the confidential report went viral on social media, it caught the government’s eye and finally, Singh was shunted out sans any fresh appointment. Singh had earlier served in Chandrapur, Akola, Beed and Latur districts. His successor Amol Yedge is an IAS officer from the 2014 batch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/controversial-yavatmal-collector-shunted-out-sans-any-posting/articleshow/81728297.cms||---

But the number of recoveries — 5,980 on Saturday, highest ever in one day since the pandemic outbreak — brought some cheer. Now, the region has 4.53 lakh Covid-19 cases and 3.80 lakh recoveries. Vidarbha’s recovery rate is 83.6%. With 75 deaths reported on Saturday, the highest in the present surge, Vidarbha’s toll reached 8,495. Death toll in the month of March surpassed the 1,100-mark, which made March the worst month after October in terms of deaths. October 2020 had reported 1,492 deaths. Though deaths are more, the case fatality rate is very low in the March 2021 surge. As against 1,33,694 cases reported in 27 days of March, 1,107 deaths have been recorded, which means the case fatality rate is 0.82%. In Vidarbha, highest death toll is of Nagpur district. Even on Saturday, 54 out of 75 deaths were from Nagpur. These include 33 from Nagpur city, 17 from rural, and 4 from other states/divisions. Yavatmal and Amravati reported 5 deaths each, Akola 4, Chandrapur 3, Wardha 2, while Buldhana and Bhandara reported 1 death each. Alarmingly, many deceased were from the under-60 age group on Saturday. The number of under-treatment patients reached a record 65,786 on Saturday. Even though majority of these patients are under home isolation, the pressure on hospitals is now visible in the form of bed and oxygen crisis in almost every district headquarters of Vidarbha. All 11 districts continued testing a good number of samples on Saturday. In all, 45,033 tests were done in the Vidarbha region. Overall, 16% samples tested positive. More tests and tracing of patients will ensure better control. Yavatmal: The district recorded five deaths, which took the toll to 611. The administration received 4,439 test reports on Saturday, of which 418 (309 men and 109 women) were positive. Currently there are 2,448 active cases in the district. Out of 27,151 Covid patients, 24,095 (including 392 on Saturday) have recovered. Meanwhile, the newly-joined district collector Amol Yedge told the media that curbing the spread of Covid-19 is the top priority. He said that in the next few days he would take stock of the personnel and machineries to take foolproof measures to curtail the coronavirus. He urged the public to adhere to norms like wearing masks, maintaining Covid distancing and staying at home. Yedge sought increased tracing and testing to bring down the number of Covid patients and the deaths in the district. Amravati: The district on Saturday posted 396 new cases and five deaths that took the caseload to 47,679 and toll to 657, respectively. Recovery of 374 patients took the total to 42,981. This left 4,041 under treatment. Chandrapur: There were 223 new cases and 103 recoveries, in addition to 3 deaths in Chandrapur on Saturday. This has left 1,859 patients under treatment.

---||Agra||3 in Agra,1 in Mathura test positive for South African strain of Covid||Agra: Three people in Agra and a woman in Mathura have been detected with South African strain of coronavirus. Besides, a new mutated strain was detected in another person. Earlier this month, samples of seven people who tested Covid-19 positive were sent from the microbiology lab at the SN Medical College here to King George's Medical University in Lucknow for whole genome sequencing. Out of these, samples of three people -- a 26-year-old woman, a 12-year old and a 55-year-old man were detected with South African strain (N501Y,E484K). Besides, the sample of a 30-year-old man was detected with a new mutated strain. The 50-year-old woman in Mathura was detected with the South African strain during genome sequencing. According to the health department officials in Agra, the 26-year-old woman had returned from South Africa in January and a 30-year-old man detected with new mutated strain had travelled to Dubai in February. The 12-year-old child and 55-year-old man had no travel history abroad. Their reports have been sent to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in New Delhi. Agra district chief medical officer, Dr RC Pandey, said, “We are identifying all people who had come into close contact with these individuals. These people are being tested for Covid-19. The South African strain and the new mutated strain is more infectious as compared to the Indian strain. People need to religiously follow Covid appropriate behavior. Wearing a mask, following social distancing norms and washing hands after frequent intervals is a must. Those eligible should immediately take the Covid vaccine.” Dr Bhudeo Singh, in-charge of Mathura's Covid Rapid Response Team, told TOI that the woman is presently under home quarantine. Her contacts are being traced and tested. Besides, seven healthcare workers tested positive for the disease despite being administered both doses of the anti-Covid vaccine in Mathura.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/3-in-agra1-in-mathura-test-positive-for-south-african-strain-of-covid/articleshow/81727718.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Youth shows fake Covid report, court seeks action||AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court has ordered its registrar to file a complaint against a youth from Kalupur for furnishing a false Covid-19 report in court in order to extend his bail. Additional sessions judge PKT Ram on Friday ordered a complaint to be filed against one Dhruv Trivedi, who had placed a certificate from Unipath Laboratory showing that he had tested Covid-19 positive on March 19. He used the certificate to seek extension of bail period for 14 more days. The probe revealed that the Covid report was issued by the laboratory in the name of one Rikesh Vatiyani, and not Dhruv Trivedi. This resulted in the rejection of his request for extended bail period as well as invite the wrath of the court for furnishing false evidence. Trivedi is a first year BCom student. He was arrested along with his father allegedly for attacking his neighbour with a sword in Dhana Suthar ni Pol in Kalupur on November 15. On March 16, the court ordered Trivedi’s release on temporary bail for 10 days so that he could take his Semester I examinations. After completion of his bail period, Trivedi sought 14 more days from the court claiming that had tested Covid-19 positive. But the court got suspicious when Trivedi furnished a photocopy of the report. It ordered Kalupur PSI J M Parmar to inquire into the veracity of the report. The inquiry report said that Trivedi had never gone for Covid-19 test at all. “As per the verification report, and statement of Dr Rameshbhai Gyanchand, the applicant/accused had never come to submit his samples nor any report in the name of applicant/accused was ever issued,” the court order reads. The doctor also revealed that the Covid report, which was presented in court, was originally issued in the name of patient Rikesh Narendrakumar Vatiyani. Trivedi allegedly misused the laboratory’s letter pad. After the report, the judge said, “This court is sanguine that the applicant has placed false certificates on file, which amounts to false evidence before this court.” It ordered the registrar to file an appropriate complaint against Trivedi before concerned metropolitan magistrate under various sections of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/youth-shows-fake-covid-report-court-seeks-action/articleshow/81728814.cms||---

---||Pune||CoWIN to soon have hourly slots for jab appointments||PUNE: Vaccination slots on CoWIN will be fine-tuned to have hourly and two-hourly slots from the current wider ‘forenoon’ and ‘afternoon’ windows to benefit those booking prior appointments, RS Sharma, who heads the committee overseeing the vaccine delivery system, told TOI on Saturday. “Once we reach a higher scale of vaccination, the system will automatically start fine-tuning slots to hourly and two-hourly windows, compared to the existing forenoon and afternoon slot options. The objective is to encourage more online appointments instead of direct walk-ins at vaccination centres,” Sharma said. He added, “Walk-ins can create uncertainties as they depend on availability of sufficient walk-in slots on a particular day. But pre-registering and booking appointments online for specific time slots takes care of such issues and ensures a smooth, hassle-free process.” Sharma said fine-tuned time slots are also likely to reduce crowding at vaccination centres and chances of people being turned away despite prior registration. The wider ‘forenoon’ and ‘afternoon’ slots led to issues because people were not being offered a more specific window of time to visit a vaccination centre. For instance, a person arriving at 1pm (part of the wider afternoon slot) would have to wait in a crowded queue for hours for the shot. A narrower 1pm-2pm slot, instead, can improve the experience. Sharma also said with the addition of the 45-plus age group, the country was likely to reach five million vaccinations per day after April 1. The average daily jabs currently stands at 2.5 million people. He said registrations have already started for people from this priority group. “Those scheduling appointments from this age group for April 1, or after that, will not be required to carry a comorbidity certificate,” he added. Health ministry officials said CoWIN has been prepared to handle the extra load. “The system will not crash,” an official said. The large number of beneficiaries from April will also include those who’re up for their second dose (especially Covaxin). Ministry officials said they expect the number of Covid vaccine doses administered in India from April 1 to cross 40 lakh doses per day, or more. “The increase will be closely linked to states’ capacity and planning. But CoWIN is indeed prepared to handle so many vaccinations per day,” a health ministry official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cowin-to-soon-have-hourly-slots-for-jab-appointments/articleshow/81728763.cms||Neha Madaan

Another 1,85,111 people took the vaccine in the age group of 25-40 years. The highest number of doses were given for people above 60 years (3,08,328). In the age group of 40-60, a total of 2,66,529 people got the jab. “Those between 20 and 40 years are mostly frontline workers employed as support staff and sanitation workers. It includes police personnel too,” said Dr G Srinvasa Rao, director of public health. Within the state, Hyderabad has the highest number of vaccine doses administered at 2.11 lakh approximately out of which only around 46,500 are Covaxin doses. Meanwhile, officials are making arrangements to give vaccine doses to all and making necessary changes to the software. “The state has enough doses to tackle the rush of those willing to take the shot,” said an official. Meanwhile, officials also reiterated on Saturday that the vaccine wastage in the state is as low as 1% and there was a miscommunication at the Centre, which had shown Telangana to have one of the highest vaccine wastage rates.

---||Ahmedabad||Art of thriving: Life skills, hobbies get dedicated forum||Ahmedabad: Through the pandemic, art has been demonstrating its power to boost people’s immunity against despair. The lockdown has ended, but Corona-induced curbs still make the sense of isolation press upon us. Many Amdavadis have turned to music, dance, or painting to remain anchored in the choppy waters of Covid-era loneliness. What the city lacked was a space that could be a rallying point for Amdavadis’ creative energies. The stage was, therefore, set for the entry of The Hive. An Ahmedabad-based marketing communications professional, Kruti Shah, created The Hive as a platform where people could learn, practice, and enjoy art forms. The literal meaning of ‘hive’ is a place in which people are busily occupied. The Hive has indeed been busy, hosting such programmes as art workshops, online events, and board game sessions. Shah said that The Hive, which started operations in January, is a forum where people can take a break from the rat race. Here, they explore hobbies or hone life skills which should be but are not part of the educational curriculum. “The Hive focuses on hobbies as well as life skill development,” Shah said. She conceded that she is lucky to work out of her childhood home which was given for the project by her tax consultant father, Mukesh Patel. The Hive has so far hosted a diverse range of workshops including on calligraphy, yoga, and board games. These events draw scores of children, working professionals, and even septuagenarians. “We want to encourage the young and seniors alike to engage with various art pursuits,” Shah said. “When one as an adult decides to do something, it satisfies a certain need, or simply provides enjoyment.” One of the objectives of the initiative is to address the need-gap in the education system. “With growing emphasis on competitiveness in academics, we’re also looking at developing evidence-based learning modules on various survival skills which are generally absent in the current academic set-up,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/art-of-thriving-life-skills-hobbies-get-dedicated-forum/articleshow/81728858.cms||---

Despite the rise in tests, the daily detections in PMR was 6,563 in the last 24 hours, a day after hitting a new peak of 7,090. District health officer Bhagwan Pawar said the positivity rate in Pune district continued to stay above 20%. On Saturday, the positivity rate was 22.4%, which need to be bought below 10%, he said. “While testing has been a focus, the administration is also paying attention to institutional care of patients registering mild symptoms so that they do not spread the infection to others,” he said. The Pune municipal areas conducted the maximum tests on Saturday (17,633). Among the new cases, the PMC areas recorded 3,463 patients on Saturday, while the PCMC and rural areas added 1,694 and 1,018 patients, respectively, in the last 24 hours.

Apart from being the highest for the season, it was the third highest recorded for March in a decade. Track the pollution level in your cityThe maximum was less by a degree of the all-time highest for March at 41.7 degrees. In 2018, it was 41 degrees and in 2011, it was 41.3 degrees on March 17. Weathermen said the rise in temperature was due to heat wave conditions prevailing over Konkan, and will continue for 24 hours. Thereafter, they forecast a gradual reduction in maximum temperature over the coast. The maximum at IMD Santacruz observatory was 40.9 degrees, which was 7.7 degrees above normal, while at Colaba it was 38 degrees, which was six degrees above normal. Shubhangi Bhute, scientist, IMD (Mumbai), said wind coming from Rajasthan was hot and dry. “It is north-easterly wind, and because of subsidence of hot air, temperature rises,” she said. Many pointed out on social media, like Twitter, how this was the beginning of the rise in temperatures considering summer lasts till May. ‘I think Mumbai heat got confused between March and May. Yeh kya May wali garmi March mein ho rahi hai,’ read a tweet from @AlwaysALilExtra, while another from @Sharanya2003 read, ‘Calm down Mumbai heat we didn’t even celebrate Holi yet’. Meanwhile, the minimum recorded at Colaba and Santacruz continued to stay on the higher side. Colaba recorded a minimum of 25 degrees and Santacruz 22.2 degrees, which was 1.2 degrees and 0.5 degrees below normal. Relative humidity recorded at Colaba and Santacruz was 58% and 30%. Higher temperatures kept the city’s air quality index in poor category. System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said Mumbai’s overall AQI for PM2.5 on Saturday was 276, which was higher than 228 a day earlier. An AQI of 200-300 is considered poor, and people with heart or lung disease, older adults and children should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/at-40-9c-saturday-was-hottest-day-of-season-aqi-still-in-poor-category-in-mumbai/articleshow/81729172.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Dehradun||Residents unhappy after 'glitches' found on newly laid road||DEHRADUN: Local residents have expressed their dissatisfaction after a newly constructed road by the Public Works Department (PWD) started losing its gravels barely hours after being re-carpeted. According to the locals, the road between Baniyawala and Sewla was re-carpeted last week and the gravels started moving out within 24 hours. The officials said the glitch happened not because of the quality of the materials used, but due to leakage in the water pipeline. “The road was built after a long wait. But then, we realised that the gravel had started coming out and cracks had developed between the road after a few hours. The PWD officials should notice such small details and avoid loss of public funds,” Mahesh Kumar, a local, said. Another resident Aniket said, “We have asked the PWD officials to repair the fault so that the road can be saved from any further damage.” A similar situation is being faced by residents at Circular. The road was re-carpeted without fixing the leakage of water pipes. Col (retd) Jagdish Sindhvani said, “We have complained several times for repairing the leakage, but no actions were taken. Even when the roads were repaired, the leakage was not fixed. Now, the same areas with leakage have been dug up and cordoned for repair which is a sheer wastage of public money.” Talking to TOI, Hariom Sharma, chief engineer, PWD, said, “The error is not because of bad quality materials, but due to water pipeline leakage. At times, the fault surfaced in the later stages. These faults are being repaired.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/residents-unhappy-after-glitches-found-on-newly-laid-road/articleshow/81727739.cms||Abhijeet Singh

Ramana, who has been nominated by CJI S A Bobde to be his successor, said that after India’s Independence, the judiciary in general has not progressed at a pace equal to the other rungs of the state. “While science and technology have affected all walks of life, integrating the same into the judicial system has been an uphill task,” he said. “We have all witnessed courts operating from dilapidated structures, rented premises, and without proper record rooms. There are premises without washrooms, waiting rooms and disabled-friendly rooms for litigants and lawyers.” This has an adverse impact on qualitative dispensation of justice, and it is therefore important for the judiciary to concentrate its efforts on modernisation of the system. Ramana appealed to stakeholders and experts to provide a sustainable and inclusive model of modernisation of the judicial infrastructure in the country. “Undeniably, strengthening the judicial infrastructure is the most important tool to reduce pendency of cases. However, the understanding of judicial infrastructure has to move beyond the issues of pendency, vacancies and number of court rooms. It should involve upgradation and a barrier-free, citizen-free environment,” Ramana said. Accessibility can be assessed when a person with the maximum disadvantage can still knock on the doors of justice, he added. Bobde too stressed on the importance of modernising existing court rooms. “I see a trend of having smaller court rooms in the future because of (Union law minister) Ravi Shankar Prasad’s ministry,” he said, adding that e-filing will do away with the requirement of rooms to store physical records. The CJI also congratulated chief minister Pramod Sawant for giving an “unusual and much-needed fillip to legal education by granting 1.50 lakh sqm of land for the Bar Council of India trust”. He said few governments have managed to do this. Bobde also took the opportunity to request the law minister for a new building for the high court of Bombay, saying the (current) building was constructed for seven judges, and now houses more than 40. A proposal is pending with the government, he said, and asked Prasad and Ramana to pursue it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cji-designate-n-v-ramana-calls-for-modernisation-of-judicial-infra/articleshow/81729185.cms||Lisa Monteiro

A police official fell to the ground while trying to save the legislator from the protesters’ ire. The melee continued for 15-20 minutes before police were able to rescue the MLA, Arun Narang, and take him to the safety of a shop about 100 metres from the BJP office. The BJP state unit chief sought President’s rule in Punjab, claiming there was a breakdown of law and order. When Narang reached Malout town at around 3.40pm, people alleged to be members of farm organisations BKU Ekta Sidhupur, BKU Lakhowal and BKU Kadian had gathered near the BJP office. Seeing this, police escorted Narang into a shop. According to witnesses, when the cops tried to get the MLA out of there, some in the crowd allegedly threw some black liquid on him. The protesters then vandalised the BJP office. “I do not know the protesters... They beat me and tore off my clothes. Police had to struggle to take me to a shop. I have apprised party leaders about the incident,” Narang told TOI. Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma, when contacted, claimed the law and order situation had worsened in the state. “The beating up of an elected representative is a clear pointer towards it. Capt Amarinder Singh should take moral responsibility for the incident and step down or his government should be dismissed and President’s rule imposed in the state as it has not only failed in protecting the law but is also promoting anti-social elements,” Sharma said. The farmers said that they had no intention of causing any physical harm to the MLA. The outfit’s general secretary, Harinder Singh Lakhowal, said, “We will look into the incident and find out who is behind all this.” Bathinda zone IGP Jaskaran Singh said appropriate legal action will be taken as per the complaint filed by the MLA. BJP politicians are running into farmers protesting against the Centre’s new farm laws wherever they try to hold political gatherings in Punjab. A day after laying siege to a hotel at Bathinda, where ex-minister Surjit Kumar Jyani had gone to take on the Congress government, farmers gheraoed on Saturday the PWD Rest House at Barnala, where BJP state vice-president Parveen Bansal had gone to address a press conference. Hundreds of BKU Ekta Ugrahan activists sat on the road and raised slogans against the Narendra Modi government. They were joined by activists of other farm organisations. Condemning the attack on Narang, the CM warned on Saturday of strict action against anyone trying to disturb the state’s peace. Capt Singh also directed DGP Dinkar Gupta to take strict and lawful action against those who had clashed with police personnel trying to rescue the MLA.

The squad recently acquired explosives and narcotics scent kits from an American company, Scentlogix, costing Rs 23 lakh. “Scent kits give off the odour of explosives or drugs but do not contain the substance itself. This bypasses the procedural issues and potential for misuse that would exist if we used actual explosives or narcotic drugs,” said Vikas Sahay, director general of police (Training). Last year, the force expanded its training capabilities by the appointment of Col Chandan Singh Rathore (retd) as senior dog training consultant, along with other specialists. Rathore had served in the Remount and Veterinary Corps, the formation responsible for training and breeding of all animals used by the Indian Army. “A batch of 38 canines are now in training here. All of them are young dogs, between six months and two years old. The breeds we have are Belgian shepherd (Malinois), German shepherd, labrador, doberman and one beagle,” said Col Rathore, at the police kennel facility in Saijpur Bogha. “There are four disciplines in which the dogs are given specialized training: Assault dogs, tracker dogs, narcotics detection and explosives detection,” Rathore said. Assault dogs These dogs are trained to attack targets such as gunmen or similar threats. "We are currently using Belgian shepherds in this role. They are superb working dogs. While they have the appropriate physical attributes for this role, where they shine is their temperament. They are hard working animals and have high levels of intelligence and motivation, which is perhaps the most important attribute. "Assault dogs can be used to storm rooms or houses in which an aggressor is hiding. They will then indicate where the aggressor is. They could also attack a gunman, and will latch on until given the order to release by the handler. In the Army dogs are fitted with cameras when they storm a room, with the handler getting real-time video feed," said Rathore. In the Gujarat Police force, assault dogs are deployed with the Chetak commando units. They can also be used in crowd control work.  Narcotics detection These dogs are trained to sniff out 19 different narcotic and psychotropic substances, including marijuana, methamphetamines, cocaine, heroin, MDMA, PCP and others and their precursors. Such dogs can be deployed at railway stations, bus depots or for the checking of shipments and packages. The Gujarat Police has currently seconded some of its narcotics dogs to the railway authorities as well. Explosives detection Dogs are trained to sniff out 13 different types of explosives, such as RDX, TNT, ammonium nitrate, Semtex, nitroglycerin, PETN, dynamite, nitrocellulose, black powder and potassium chlorate among others. Such dogs are deployed with bomb detection and disposal squads or for VIP security or for bomb sweeps of venues where people are to gather etc. They can also sniff out persons who have recently handled explosives. On detecting explosives, the dogs have been trained to give their handlers silent cues, to avoid alerting any suspects in the vicinity or to avoid setting off sound-triggered explosive devices. Labradors and beagles are being used in this role. Tracker dogs These canines are trained to follow scent trails left by fugitives or for scent discrimination, that is picking out one person out of many, whose scent may be at the scene of a crime. For instance, if a theft has been committed and there are several suspects, the dog can sniff out the perpetrator from any article that provides a reference scent from the scene of the crime. While following the scent trail of a fugitive, if the dog comes across the target, it will hold latch on and not release until commanded to by its handler. Dog squad organization "The full strength of our K9 squad is 158 dogs and handlers. Thirty-two are presently deployed with the various Bomb Detection and Disposal Squads (BDDS), six are with our Chetak commando units and the remainder are distributed among the state’s police commissionerates and district headquarters. We have also provided some to the railways authorities. Apart from training fresh batches here, we periodically bring back qualified dogs and handlers for 45-day refresher courses,” said Sahay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/k9-squad-gets-more-teeth/articleshow/81728830.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Spiralling raw material prices make end products costlier||Ahmedabad: Spiralling raw material prices coupled with a surge in transportation and packaging costs seem to have made things tougher for industries, which are already battling challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Even as manufacturers are facing problems related to demand, they have been forced to pass on the higher input costs to end consumers. Those who cannot raise the prices of end products due to muted demand are taking a hit on their margins to survive. With both production costs and prices of finished goods moving northward, several industrial units have encountered reductions in orders and lower capacity utilization.Realty gets costlierThe prices of key construction raw materials such as cement and steel had firmed up by 23% and 45% respectively by the end of 2020, according to estimates by real estate trade body CREDAI. “Cement prices have stopped increasing, while steel prices have eased to an extent. However, they are still higher than the levels witnessed in pre-Covid times,” said Ashish Patel, president, CREDAI-Gujarat.Apart from these, the cost of transportation and costs of other materials used in construction such as hardware, sanitary ware, and bricks have moved northwards. “This has resulted in a rise of at least 15-20% in construction costs to developers. It has forced realtors to raise the prices of properties in ongoing projects by 5-10% and by 20% in new projects,” added Patel.“Construction costs have shot up and developers have no option but to pass on the substantial increase of 5-6% to the buyers,” said N K Patel, chairman, Gujarat Chapter, National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO).“This (raw material price rise) is hurting real estate sales already hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, and we were only just recovering,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/spiralling-raw-material-prices-make-end-products-costlier/articleshow/81728336.cms||Kalpesh Damor

The suspect was nabbed after being injured in a brief encounter with police. The SI was killed while trying to detain the suspect who had been brandishing a countrymade pistol during a dispute with his brother over harvesting of crops. Talking with mediapersons, SP (city) Botre Rohan Pramod said acting on a tip-off, a police team barricaded the area in Jaitpur for checking vehicles. The suspect, Vishwanath, was spotted coming towards the police team. When he was asked to stop, he whipped out a countrymade pistol and fired at the police party. The police returned fire, in which he got injured in both legs.`` The suspect was admitted to a primary health centre for treatment. The SP added that the police have seized two countrymade weapons and a bike from his possession. On Wednesday evening, Vishwanath allegedly shot the SI in the neck at Nehra village, when he was being chased. The police had announced a reward of Rs 50,000 on any information leading to the arrest of Vishwanath and had also decided to invoke the stringent National Security Act against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-sis-killer-arrested-after-brief-encounter/articleshow/81727749.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Hyderabad||Vaccinated or not, Covid appropriate behviour must: Experts||Hyderabad: With some people getting ‘mild’ Covid-19 infection even after taking vaccine shots in the city, experts point out that the vaccine can be a life-saver and cut down severity in case of an infection. However, it is not likely to give any respite from the mask and Covid appropriate behaviour, essential for people vaccinated or not. Insisting on the need for others to take the jab, Indian Medical Association’s Academy of Medical Specialities national secretary Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav said, “The vaccines which are being made and given now are approved for emergency usage and have 75-80% efficacy. This means that there is still some chance of infection, but it drastically cuts down the chances of an infection and hence everybody should get vaccinated.” “We want the government to make the vaccine available in hospitals so that everybody can take it. That way if a large chunk of the population is vaccinated, it can cut out the chain of spread,” he added. Adding that the vaccinated might even need booster doses if the virus mutates further, the expert stressed on the need for continuing Covid appropriate behaviour at all times. While there is no respite from the mask and hand sanitizers, it is essential for people who have been vaccinated as well to ensure that they do not spread the virus. “The Covid vaccine does not mean that we will not get the infection. If we get the infection even after vaccination, the symptoms are usually mild and the body is able to fight it much better. While the severity of the infection in a person, who is vaccinated is much low, the person can spread the virus. Hence, wearing masks and Covid appropriate behaviour has to be followed despite vaccination,” said Dr Ehsan Ahmed Khan, incharge director Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS), Gachibowli. “The body develops antibodies to fight an infection, but it takes at least two weeks after second dose for the vaccine to be effective. Covid inappropriate behaviour, particularly before the antibodies develop, is the main reason for reinfection,” Dr P Raghu Ram, director, Kims-Ushalakshmi Centre for Breast Diseases, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vaccinated-or-not-covid-appropriate-behviour-must-experts/articleshow/81728799.cms||Amrita Didyala

The startup which has been designing and manufacturing systems to generate medical air and medical gasses is on the cusp of doubling its revenue by the end of 2020-21.“Post pandemic, medical technology industry boomed significantly as the overall focus was to strengthen healthcare infrastructure. We had installed our systems at seven locations in Gujarat in March 2020 and had ventured to other states by then. But soon after the lockdown, inquiries began pouring in, and projects at various hospitals materialized. We installed systems for the supply of medical air (purified atmospheric air), medical oxygen, and medical gasses at some five more locations in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra and are now looking to clock a revenue of Rs 1.5 crore by the end of March 2021,” said Siddharth Rajvanshi, founder, Technik Spirits Inc.Rajvanshi, an engineering drop-out from Ganpat University, worked in his family business, Mechatronics Engineering, after quitting his bachelor’s degree course in 2010.“I first worked at our compressor manufacturing company in Ahmedabad, and later in October 2018, founded my startup,” he said.The company designs systems for medical gas supply at hospitals including medical oxygen, medical air, medical vacuum, and Anaesthetic Gas Scavenging System (AGSS). The systems are manufactured at a factory in Kathwada GIDC, with the ready systems transported to the actual project sites. Assembly and on-site commissioning and eventual maintenance are then undertaken. Technik Spirit Inc is currently incubated at CRADLE, EDII, and has filed and successfully published a PCT patent for medical gas generators.At present, the company has some 12 installations at hospitals in Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Patan, and Tagwada, which is along the Gujarat-Rajasthan border.“Three more projects are in the pipeline at Indore, Madhya Pradesh, and at Mangaon and Raigad in Maharashtra,” said Rajvanshi, whose startup is completely self-funded.“We invested Rs 40 lakh at the beginning when we were developing and testing the first prototype. At that time, we had part of the seed fund assistance from friends and family. Going forward, we aim to strengthen our dealer network outside Gujarat, especially in the states of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh, where more projects are coming up. We’re also looking to expand to at least seven more sales and service centres in southern India by the end of 2021-22,” said Rajvanshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/med-tech-startup-from-ahmedabad-doubles-revenues-in-the-pandemic-year/articleshow/81728340.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Nagpur||‘Poor preparation’ causing more deaths in Nagpur compared to other parts of Maharashtra||NAGPUR: The present surge in Covid-19 cases is not limited to Vidarbha region now. Cases are now coming from almost every circle of Maharashtra, as a result of which state-wide night curfew decision has been taken. However, a simple comparison with data of daily Covid-19 cases of last six days shows that death rate in Vidarbha, and especially in Nagpur, is significantly higher than other places. Vidarbha region has reported 40,652 new cases and 406 deaths from March 22 to 27, which means the case fatality rate is almost 1%. Mumbai circle has reported 52,844 cases and 134 deaths. The case fatality rate of the region is 0.25% which is almost one fourth of Vidarbha. Similar is the situation in Nashik circle (0.34%) and Pune (0.20%). Though number of Covid-19 cases is more or almost similar to that of Vidarbha region, deaths are significantly low in other regions. “Almost 1% patients have died in Vidarbha region and if we compare it with the September 2020 figures, the fatality rate is lower in the second wave. Death rate was very high during the first wave. In the current spike, death rate is low in all other parts of Maharashtra,” said Dr Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer. An alarming factor is that Nagpur district is worst hit in terms of Covid-19 deaths. It alone has reported 209 of the 406 deaths in Vidarbha. Experts have blamed poor preparation for this.  “Nagpur receives patients from almost every part of Vidarbha. The surge started from Amravati, Akola and Yavatmal in February only. We had enough time to establish facilities but nothing significant was done by the authorities,” said a senior member of the Covid task force, who didn’t wish to be named. The member also told TOI that the task force has been alerting the administration about possible surge in Nagpur since February, but the administration delayed the restart of CCCs and other facilities. As per the data received from the IGGMCH and GMCH, two tertiary health care facilities in Vidarbha, nearly 40% of patients died within 24 hours of the hospitalization. It means the patients are presenting in critical condition. According to doctors, there is no time for blame-game now. “We must promote vaccination by all means now. Nagpur has a comparatively smaller population and an experiment of vaccinating all above 18 years of age can be done here,” said pulmonologist Dr Sushant Meshram.

---||Agra||Former Zila Panchayat member among five SP workers booked for abusing and beating up lekhpal in Mainpuri||AGRA: Five persons, including a former Zila Panchayat member from Samajwadi Party (SP), were booked by the Mainpuri police on Saturday for allegedly abusing and beating up secretary of lekhpal association in Mainpuri’s Bhogaon division a day earlier, after he tried to mediate and stop some women activists from misbehaving with a colleague. An FIR has been registered against the former Zila Panchayat member Sucheta Shakya, her driver and workers — Meera Devi, her husband Santosh Kumar and one unidentified person — for "rioting, assault, intentional insult and criminal intimidation, among others" at Bhogaon police station. The complaint was filed by Lekhpal Pradeep Kumar Saxena, who is also secretary of Lekhpal Sangathan in Bhogaon. According to police, the SP workers became "aggressive and violent" after one of the lekhpals, Navneet Maurya, refused to modify the voters' list "as per their wishes". Agitated lekhpals demanded action against the workers and have submitted a police complaint against them on Friday. A five-minute purported video clip which later went viral on social media shows a woman worker pulling the hair of lekhpal Pradeep Saxena. Talking to TOI, Saxena alleged that he was slapped by Sucheta Shakya and then his hair was pulled by one Meeta Devi. They had created a ruckus on the SDM premises in Bhogaon. “I was assaulted by them and everything is recorded on CCTV. My finger also got fractured during the attack. They had broken the cabin glass and tore papers,” he alleged, adding that strict action should be taken against the suspects and staff's safety must be ensured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/former-zila-panchayat-member-among-five-sp-workers-booked-for-abusing-and-beating-up-lekhpal-in-mainpuri/articleshow/81727762.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Nagpur||Ventilators, ICU beds getting occupied fast, Nagpur Municipal Corporation adds 6 more hospitals||NAGPUR: The 79 private hospitals, spread across 10 zones of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), were left with just eight ventilators, 16 ICU beds and 99 oxygen beds on Saturday morning. Dhantoli — the medical hub of city — and five other zones didn’t have a single ventilator for Covid patients since Friday night. Laxmi Nagar, Dharampeth and Mangalwari zones, accounting for nearly 50% of private Covid hospitals, had only three ventilators and nine ICU beds on Saturday morning while five ventilators and over 50 ICU beds became available by the evening. The data indicates that more critical patients are being rushed to hospitals during night. Those residing in Dharampeth, Mangalwari and Laxmi Nagar zone belong to affluent class which is said to be the worst affected during the ongoing second Covid wave. The overall vacancy of beds again came down by over 120 as the city had just 375 beds in morning. This included 252 in government set up where the bulk of availability is just on records and beds get occupied soon after discharge in morning. The vacant beds increased to 418 in the evening with inclusion of more hospitals. Additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma said six more hospitals were added for Covid treatment. “There is still hope. We haven’t exhausted our capacity. I know the situation is critical. If critical patients are reporting directly, they are getting a bed. But people shouldn’t wait for that situation. Our teams are approaching them. When they face problems, they don’t contact or inform us,” he said. Regarding fewer ICU beds and ventilators, Sharma added, “Very few patients are in need of them.” ENT surgeon and Covid in-charge of OCHRI Dr Nandu Kolwadkar explained that any private hospital has 10% beds for Critical Care Unit. “Of these, five ventilators are kept aside for regular patients. The deterioration rate is 50%. So, 30 to 40 ventilators invasive or non-invasive are needed,” he said. Dr Kolwadkar said earlier people would get admitted in panic. “While seeking bed, they also don’t tell correct oxygen saturation level. When they reach, they are found to have 40% or below SPO2 level and need ventilator,” he said. Hence, the vacancy data is changing more frequently than expected as ICU and ventilator beds get occupied unexpectedly. “On Friday, four such patients came . We have to keep two ventilators for such emergencies. The vacant ventilators also come handy when under-treatement patients go bad,” he said. Dr Kolwadkar said during evening hours, it is very difficult to find a ventilator because all hospitals run full at night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ventilators-icu-beds-getting-occupied-fast-nmc-adds-6-more-hosps/articleshow/81727764.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

In a joint operation, the Wakad and the Talegaon Dabhade police raided the spots near the stadium — an adjacent hill and an under-construction site — besides a hotel in Vimannagar and arrested the bookies hailing from Haryana, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Goa, Uttar Pradesh, Mumbai, Rajasthan as well as a few from the city. The bookies from other states had come down to the city just before the One Day International (ODI) series started earlier this week, said a source. The Pimpri Chinchwad commissioner of police (CP), Krishna Prakash, said, “The bookies were using high resolution cameras and binoculars to get the live feed of the match. They were spreading the information of the match before the live telecast was beamed on TV sets of viewers, taking advantage of the lag of six seconds in the live telecast. They were accepting bets from Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Goa and other parts of the country.” Prakash said, “The bookies were watching the match from long distance and passing on the ball-by-ball developments to different parts of the country. We shall study the data stored in the seized laptops and cellphones for further probe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/33-bookies-held-on-charge-of-accepting-online-bets-on-odi/articleshow/81728801.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Devendra Fadnavis maligning state’s image through false accusations: Nana Patole||NAGPUR: A war of words erupted between Congress’ Nana Patole and BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis as both traded barbs over various issues, right from the controversial report by IPS officer Rashmi Shukla to actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. During his visit to the city on Saturday, Patole accused Fadnavis of maligning Maharashtra’s image due to his ‘constant accusations’ and also for making ‘childish statements’ related to Shukla’s report. Patole even went on to say that many cases, like the 2014 Judge Loya’s death for which BJP-led government had come under fire from the Opposition, will now ‘come out in the open’. Leader of opposition (LoP) Fadnavis downplayed every allegation by saying, “I don’t take Patole seriously. Nobody in Maharashtra does.” Patole said, “For the last one year, Fadnavis has been making allegations against the state government, right from actor Sushant Singh, to (Sachin) Vaze to Parambir Singh. By doing so, Fadnavis has maligned Maharashtra’s image through false accusations. And all of his charges have proved to be baseless. He’s showing tendencies similar to that of a liar.” Fadnavis, who too reached Nagpur later in the evening, said it was preposterous to blame him for maligning the state’s image. “These (government) people are the master of Vaze. And it’s their actions which have led to a negative image,” said Fadnavis. Regarding speculations of the Mahavikas Aghadi (MVA) now ‘getting back’ at the BJP by reopening of old cases, Patole said, “We follow the common minimum programme and in that we do what’s best for the state and there’s no feeling of revenge. In fact we ignored the blunders the previous government committed but Fadnavis has taken a stand of constantly accusing the government. So now, many cases will come to the fore, like that of judge Loya and Congress will demand an investigation in all cases.” Patole also said actions of IPS Parambir Singh, who alleged that home minister Anil Deshmukh asked cops to collect Rs100 crore per month, must been seen with a political lens. “Singh approached the courts directly, even though as per rules he should have taken permission from the state government. His legal counsel Mukul Rohatgi also happens to be the central government’s legal representative. So people have started to connect these dots and understand the whole thing,” said Patole. Reacting to Fadnavis’ allegation that it was a minister who actually wrote the letter signed by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, which talked about IPS officer Shukla’s report, Patole said, “It’s absolutely childish to even suggest such a thing. And Fadnavis, a former chief minister and current LoP, knows very well that in Maharashtra we uphold Constitutional values at every level.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fadnavis-maligning-states-image-through-false-accusations-patole/articleshow/81728353.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Nagpur||FDA to monitor oxygen sales at manufacturing units and hospitals||NAGPUR: Concerns around shortage of medical oxygen in the wake of a staggering rise in the district’s Covid cases have propelled the food and drug administration (FDA) authorities to undertake an orchestrated drive at manufacturing units, re-fillers and the private hospitals earmarked for Covid treatment in order to monitor sales, dispatches, deliveries, supplies and stocks. The authorities are set to check the distribution channels too. The FDA authorities, who were part of the review meeting under divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar on Saturday, are learnt to have prepared a plan of action to check the ground realities related to oxygen supply. FDA sources said a liquid oxygen manufacturing company, which earlier produced 50-60 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen, is now compelled to produce around 90-100 metric tonnes which is nearly as much as its per-day capacity of 95 metric tonnes. The Covid task force, under the civic administration, has requested the manufacturing unit to ramp up production by another 10-20 metric tonnes. On March 25, the company had a stock of around 84 metric tonnes. The company has been also asked to discontinue its supply to Akola and Nanded for the time being, given the district’s anticipated spike in demand in April. The district would get around 10-20 more metric tonnes of liquid oxygen this way. Earlier, FDA commissioner Abhimanyu Kale had alerted the collectors across the state about the Covid situation possibly causing oxygen shortage panic. In a letter to the collectors, Kale had underlined two real-life situations in the last few days which had triggered oxygen shortage alarms, but had later turned out to be misleading ones upon verification. In Dhule, a hospital authority had raised an alarm regarding their fast-depleting oxygen stock, stating the supply would not last more than couple of more hours. Later, it was discovered that the tank had enough supply for longer period. In another situation at Malegaon, one of the hospitals had a contract of getting a supply of around 350 cylinders of oxygen from a vendor. It had later come to the fore that the vendor had entered into the contract without having capacity to supply the required quantity of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fda-to-monitor-oxygen-sales-at-manufacturing-units-and-hospitals/articleshow/81727772.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Agra||Rats guzzled 1,400 cartons of booze kept in thana: UP cops||AGRA: After over 1,400 cartons of liquor were found missing from the strongroom of Kotwali dehat police station in UP's Etah, the policemen deployed there claimed that the cans and bottles were destroyed by rodents. The general diary records of the police station accessed by TOI claimed that rats chewed up plastic cans containing illicit liquor, broke the glass bottles and damaged the bags containing the seized contraband. Could the rodents indeed be responsible for the disappearance of 1,459 cartons of seized liquor, estimated to cost Rs 35 lakh? Smelling a rat, the ADG (Agra zone) Rajeev Krishna tasked an IPS officer from Aligarh, Vikas Singh, to probe the matter. A preliminary inquiry revealed that the policemen had sold the seized liquor to gangster Bantu Yadav, who was arrested on Friday in connection with the fake dhaba encounter case, under the jurisdiction of the same police station. In the case, SHO Indreshpal Singh is also an accused and is on the run. A surprise inspection of the police station’s strongroom (maalkhana) on March 12 by the district magistrate Vibha Chahal and senior superintendent of police Sunil Kumar Singh had revealed that 1,459 cartons of seized liquor were missing. Despite summons, neither SHO Indreshpal Singh nor head clerk Rasaal Singh turned up to give an explanation. DM Chahal had ordered that an FIR be registered against the SHO and the head clerk, following which both were suspended. The duo was booked under IPC section 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant) and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act and UP Excise Act. The investigation of the missing liquor has added a new twist to the ongoing probe into the dhaba encounter case. ADG (Agra zone) Rajeev Krishna said, “Following primary investigation, it has surfaced that the seized liquor was sold to a local resident, Bantu Yadav, by the policemen. Bantu has a criminal record. He was arrested on Friday. The entire matter is being investigated in detail.” Bantu Yadav’s name cropped up during investigation of the dhaba encounter case by the additional superintendent of police (crime) Rahul Kumar. Preliminary investigation found that Yadav had helped the policemen stage a fake recovery from the 10 men held following “an encounter”. In the FIR, the Kotwali dehat police had alleged that the 10 people were part of an organized gang and were hatching a plan for loot. They had also claimed that the 10 were held following “an encounter” during which the "gang" had fired six rounds. In the recovery, local police had shown seizure of six illegal weapons, 80 litres of illicit liquor and 2kg of contraband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/rats-guzzled-1400-cartons-of-booze-kept-in-thana/articleshow/81727777.cms||Deepak Lavania

This is the second police case file against the couple in the city. The bank officials have lodged a separate complaint against the couple with the cybercrime police station. According to the police, the two have withdrawn about Rs 35 lakh in total from over six ATMs of the bank since March 10. All three police stations are on the lookout for the couple.

The online exam was for government posts in Ahmednagar district. Many candidates from Aurangabad and other districts appeared for it. Tehsildar Madhuri Andhale lodged a complaint with Ahmednagar police. It was forwarded to the Pune police as the centre is located on Katraj-Dehu Road bypass. Police said the government would file about 30 cases of cheating, forgery, impersonation in the state after many such candidates were found appearing proxy. The Bharati Vidyapeeth police said the government had taken the candidates’ fingerprints on biometric readers. “The two proxy candidates had forged hall tickets. The examiners clicked their photographs and scanned their hall tickets. Both were different from the original. They sat for the exams, but were removed after a few minutes. The original candidates are also from Aurangabad,” an officer said.  The Hinjewadi police too on Friday booked a candidate and his proxy for appearing for exam at a centre near Hinjewadi. Both are also from Aurangabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-proxy-candidates-among-4-booked/articleshow/81728804.cms||---

And to ensure that community animals have access to clean drinking water, animal welfare organisations in the city are giving out free water bowls to concerned citizens. They are also requesting people to participate in the water bowl challenge, by clicking and uploading photos of animals drinking out of the bowls so that more people are inspired to do the same. On Saturday, People For Cattle in India (PFCI) kicked off their initiative, Water Bowl Challenge ’21 at Ambassador Pallava. “Every year, thousands of animals and birds die due to dehydration as they don’t have access to clean drinking water. So we have been issuing free cement water bowls from 2014,” says G Arun Prasanna, founder and secretary, PFCI, adding that they gave out 200 bowls last year. “This year we want to give away 1,000 bowls. And we want people to upload photos and tag a person to take up the challenge so that animals across the city get help.” PFCI has pick-up points at Kodambakkam, Anna Nagar, T Nagar and Nungambakkam where people can get their bowls. The Blue Cross of India (BCI) also began giving out water bowls a few days ago. “We have given about 50 so far and are soon staring online registrations. People can come to BCI and pick it up. We don’t charge for the bowls but people can make a donation if they want,” says Vinod Kumar of BCI. “We also request people to keep replenishing the water and clean the bowl regularly so that it doesn’t become a public health risk.” Nisha Singh and Prabha Venugopal of Bhairava Animal Welfare Trust says they have been giving out bowls for the last two years. “We are giving steel bowls with a lock and key so that people cannot steal them,” says Prabha, adding that people can contact them through their Facebook page. “If people want one bowl, we give it for free but if they want more, we charge Rs 170 each.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/this-summer-lets-take-up-water-bowl-challenge-help-animals-quench-thrist/articleshow/81728342.cms||Priya Menon

---||Nagpur||6 months on, 86 beds with oxygen at Pachpaoli CCC gathering dust||NAGPUR: Amid shortage of beds hampering Covid treatment, a massive facility set up nearly six months ago remains unutilized. At the Pachpaoli Covid care centre, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has set up an 86-bed walk-in oxygen facility, which is yet to be inaugurated. The idea was to administer oxygen to patients with low saturation levels till they could get a hospital bed. The other way round, patients only needing oxygen could also be taken out of the hospital and kept at the centre for rest of the days. This could have led to faster availability of beds. The centre is aimed to give the stop-gap facility to patients so that their condition does not worsen due to lack of oxygen. The idea was mooted by then municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe. The facility could not get operational for want of staff. Today, 86 brand new beds ready with oxygen dispenser fixed to each one of them are gathering dust. Currently, only Covid testing and quarantine facilities continue at Pachpaoli. Sources said it would need a staff of at least 40, including doctors and paramedics. The teams will have to be led by physicians followed by junior doctors to carry forward there instructions, said a source. “The decision on administering the quantity of oxygen has to be taken by a physician. The quantity depends on the level of saturation in the patents for which only a physician can take the right call,” said a source aware of the issue. The centre may need 6-8 doctors to be deployed on shift basis. The rest would be paramedic staff. Lately, staff has been approved from the railways which has not reported yet. However, the doctors do not include any physician. Rather, the doctors allotted to the centre are specialists in faculties like orthopaedics or ENT. A physician is the right person to take a decision on the level of oxygen to be administered. Apart from it, decisions have to be taken on shifting patients to a hospital if need arises. Again, for such referrals, a physician is best suited, sources said. There is a view that even others specialists can run the show as they have basic MBBS degree. However, even for that the staff should report. None has turned up so far, said a source. A senior NMC official said the staff has been allotted and the centre can be started in a day. A team from railways has been requisitioned. However, sources said even if the staff comes now, oxygen supply has to be lined up. Twenty jumbo cylinders were allotted to the centre which were diverted to another hospital as the stock had ended there. A final reporting of the staff too is awaited, a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/6-mths-on-86-beds-with-oxygen-at-pachpaoli-ccc-gathering-dust/articleshow/81727785.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Coimbatore||It’s Velumani vs DMK in Thondamuthur||For two consecutive terms, the DMK gave Thondamuthur assembly constituency to its allies – the Congress in 2011 and Manithaneya Makkal Katchi in 2016. The results cemented AIADMK leader and local administration minister S P Velumani’s position as an undisputed leader in this scenic, agrarian, gounder-dominated constituency in Coimbatore district. As Velumani continued to strengthen his hold over the constituency, the DMK found its organisational apparatus in tatters, so much so that the party has paradropped its environment wing secretary Kartikeya Sivasenapathy to take on Velumani in the present election. As expected, the AIADMK raised the outsider tag, but the DMK feels the jallikattu activist, who runs a cattle research centre, is popular and can tackle Velumani. Sivasenapathy is a gounder too. DMK leaders also feel Sivasenapathy, being an outsider, cannot be influenced by Velumani. “The seemingly successful run of Velumani is all set to come to an end,” says Sivasenapathy. DMK men, however, know that it is easier said than done. Velumani has a long list of projects and schemes that have been brought to Thondamuthur in the last 10 years - a combined drinking water scheme to government arts college to roads to even interior hamlets; the constituency has almost all basic amenities. Besides, AIADMK men say that Velumani attends every occasion, from wedding to funerals, ear-piercing to house warming ceremonies and has made himself a household name. A closer look shows that this is not a fight between Velumani and Sivasenapathy or the AIADMK and the DMK. It’s rather a fight between S P Velumani and the DMK; it’s the reputation of Velumani that is at stake. The question before the DMK is whether the anti-incumbency factor and its poll promises are enough to decimate Velumani. “He has touched the lives of each and every family in Thondamuthur in one way or the other. He lives in this constituency, meets the people, responds to their complaints and sorts out their issues immediately,” says an AIADMK functionary. The DMK is banking heavily on about 50,000 Muslim voters, who they think, would support the DMK to keep the BJP at bay. Velumani disputes the erosion of Muslim votes. He says Muslims would support him even if they choose not to back the AIADMK. The ruling party is also hoping that MNM candidate Shahjahan would split Muslim votes. Moreover, the BJP had bagged 19,000 votes in the segment, contesting alone, in 2016. It would add to Velumani’s kitty, they feel. As Velumani is desperate to retain his fiefdom, the DMK is bent on defeating the Kongu strongman, who has been a thorn in the foot for M K Stalin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/its-velumani-vs-dmk-in-thondamuthur/articleshow/81728348.cms||Mayilvaganan

---||Chennai||Chennai to sizzle as IMD sees a 2°C-3°C above-normal rise||CHENNAI: Brace for very hot days as weathermen have forecast temperatures to rise by 2°C-3°C above normal over many parts of the state including Chennai and neighbouring districts from April 2. A change in wind direction from moist seabreeze to hot and dry land breeze was cited as reason. Private weather forecasters and bloggers said as of now weather models show a rise in temperatures at least for most part of next week with mercury likely to touch 38°C in several places in the state including Chennai while the city’s suburbs and a few interior districts could cross 40°C after mid next week. For the next 48 hours, maximum and minimum temperatures in the city and the neighbourhoods are likely to hover at 35°C and 26°C with mainly clear sky conditions. The average maximum temperature in the city during April is 34.5°C. “This (the rise in temperatures) is due to the surface winds from the northwest direction moving towards Tamil Nadu,” IMD said. On Saturday, temperatures in interior districts like Karur, Dharmapuri and Salem touched 38°C. Private forecasters and bloggers said models indicate moist easterly winds losing strength while the northwesterly winds gathering pace by March 30. This means the incoming hot and dry land breeze could increase the maximum temperature not just over interior districts but over coastal regions of Tamil Nadu as well. “As of now, we could see the temperature rise for at least four days next week,” said Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist, Skymet Weather. Blogger Pradeep John said the change in wind direction would be due to a circulation over Andaman though models show it may remain weak and not move.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/city-to-sizzle-as-imd-sees-a-2c-3c-above-normal-rise/articleshow/81728347.cms||---

This will also motivate junior lawyers to follow in your footsteps,” he said, speaking at the inaugural function of the new high court building at Porvorim. “Members of the bar have a critical role to play in the justice delivery system,” Ramana, the next chief justice of India, said. “Never forget your duty towards society. Remember that the population of our country is predominantly rural with low levels of income. They cannot afford the legal fees to fight for their cause. The legal community is known for its service to the people, the nation…” The legal fraternity has a critical role to play in the justice delivery system, he said, Speaking about the new high court building and the latest infrastructure, Ramana said one must not forget that the focal point of the justice system is always the litigant and the justice-seeker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/do-more-pro-bono-work-next-cji-to-senior-lawyers/articleshow/81729201.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Mumbai||Rising mercury in city brings vaccine shots down to 38,000 in Mumbai||Mumbai: While Saturdays usually see a large turnout for Covid-19 vaccination, the city saw only 38,158 stepping out to get their shot in the scorching heat of 40.9 degrees Celsius this time. On March 20, Mumbai had recorded its highest vaccination turnout of 49,547. “We are working towards increasing the daily vaccination to 75,000 within the next few days,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal has often said that the final goal is to vaccinate around 1 lakh people a day in Mumbai. Towards this goal, the BMC has decided to keep vaccination centres open on Monday, which is Holi. “As people cannot play Holi like they usually do due to Covid-19 restrictions, we expect some people to turn up for vaccination,” said Kakani. However, vaccination centres will only work at half of the capacity. The BMC is taking other steps as well to increase daily vaccinations. In the next week, the BMC has plans to add 25 more private hospitals as vaccination centres. At present, 66 out of the 108 vaccination centres in the city belong to the private sector. There also is a plan to open a vaccination centre in each slum cluster as the response from the lower socio-economic strata has so far been poor. The BMC’s first initiative to take vaccination to the slums by opening an urban health centre called ‘Chhota Sion Hospital’ in Dharavi has so far not shown great results. On Saturday, only 211 took the vaccine, with a total of 877 having taken vaccines in the six days since the initiative started. “We may even allowed vaccination in our dispensaries that are located in the slums,” said Kakani. The BMC is tying up with NGOs to motivate slum-dwellers and boost the vaccination drive, especially in the slum colonies. Incidentally, of the 10.86 lakh vaccine doses given in Mumbai so far, almost half (5.16 lakh) were given to senior citizens. The state had recorded 2.65 lakh vaccinations on Friday (the state shares its data a day later). Again, the bulk were senior citizens at 1.49 lakh. While 2.31 lakh were given Covishield on Saturday, 33,344 were given Covaxin. The state has so far managed to administer 5.5 million vaccine doses. Officials on Friday said that Maharashtra was the first state in the country to administer 5 million Covid-19 vaccine shots. With 5.94 crore vaccine shots had been given across the country till Saturday evening, Maharashtra accounted for over 9% of the total vaccinations nationwide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rising-mercury-in-city-brings-vaccine-shots-down-to-38000-in-mumbai/articleshow/81729206.cms||Malathy Iyer

As many as eight individuals have been arrested. The firearms, including pistols, according to police officials, were supposed to be supplied in the state's poll-bound villages. The STF sleuths also seized heavy machinery and equipment used for making the firearms. Circle officer, STF Brijesh Singh, said, "We were receiving information of large scale manufacturing of illegal firearms in the region. So, we formed several teams to work on the input." "On Friday, a raid was conducted in the Malyana region where we found two pistols and 32 tamanchas. The arrested man, Tabrez, during questioning, gave us input of yet another area in Dhyanchand locality where a raid was conducted. Here, one Bhavendra and Farooq were arrested and 32 firearms recovered. Police teams later raided places in Kithore and Lisari Gate," Singh added. Notably, a tamancha was sold for Rs 2,000, while a pistol cost Rs 20,000. During interrogation, all confessed that the supply was to be made in the nearby areas, ahead of the panchayat polls, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-stf-seizes-133-illegal-firearms-ahead-of-panchayat-polls-eight-held/articleshow/81727802.cms||Sandeep Rai

This means the civic body will again lose Rs 76.11 lakh that it could have earned as tax from 3,081 properties. Barring these 13 villages, the tax branch of the authority has started sending bills to all property owners of the city. Punjab governor and UT administrator V P Singh Bandore had last year exempted the 13 villages from paying tax owing to the coronavirus pandemic. Sources said the administration has not withdrawn the order till date, automatically giving the privilege once again to the villages. “The last year’s order specifically mentioned that that tax exemption will continue till further orders. As no new order has come to the authority, this has led the civic body not to charge property tax from the upcoming financial year starting from April 1,” sources said. Daria has the maximum commercial properties of 442 units. Dhanas comes next with 424 and Behlana with 386 commercial units. The tax amount has been calculated as per area of these commercial properties. “Since all these villages were transferred to the MC from the administration, the UT had no record of any commercial property and therefore, we had to conduct the detailed survey of each commercial property of these villages. Many of these commercial properties, mainly shops, are operational from past many years, but were not paying any tax. During the survey, it was also found that many properties were in litigation”, said an official of the MC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/13-villages-out-of-property-tax-ambit-for-2nd-yr-in-row/articleshow/81727798.cms||Deepak Yadav

The peaceful candle light march was conducted in the memory of the three deceased and also to demand speedy trial and justice in the horrifying case. The deceased were identified as Ankush Narula, Ram Prasad and Dharampreet Singh. TOI spoke to the family members of the deceased. Wife of one of the victims, who is eight months pregnant, was not in a condition to speak. Meanwhile, 20-year-old Amanpreet Singh, brother of Dharampreet Singh, said, “My brother has been working in the night shifts for the past two years, but such incidents never took place. One week has gone and my parents are still in a state of shock.” Kanti, wife of Ram Prasad, the innocent cyclist, who was killed in the accident, said, “My husband was the lone bread winner of our house. We want justice and support for the future of my children. I have four daughters, of which, one is married. I also have a son. How will we earn and eat?” She further added that when she came to know about the accident, she first went to a private hospital at Sector 71 and then to the Phase VI civil hospital, but found her husband at the GMCH-32, Chandigarh. However, Ankush Narula’s wife, Rajni, was not in a condition to talk, but his childhood friend, Nakul said, “Ankush was a hardworking man. His father has been going through some medical conditions for the past many years and even after one week, he still doesn’t know that his son is no more. It is a big loss to the family.” The family members of the deceased victims appealed the Punjab government to announce a compensation for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/merc-accident-relatives-hold-protest-demand-speedy-trial/articleshow/81727806.cms||---

On Friday, the positivity rate was 12.75%. The samples tested on Saturday were a five-day low since March 23 as only 1,914 samples were tested on Saturday. “Cases in Chandigarh rose from a seven-day average low of 19 cases per day in February 12 to 294 per day now, whereas the tests rose from only 1,257 (seven-day average) to 1,914. In other words, the cases rose more than ten times from what it was in second week of February. The seven-day average total positivity rate, as a result, has grown from 1.4% to 10.8%,” said Dr Rijo John, adjunct professor at Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kochi. Also, there has been a rise in the number of deaths since March 26. “While the cases are rising, lowering of the tests is not a good strategy,” said a public health expert. Meanwhile, the city witnessed 294 cases and two deaths on Saturday. As many as 152 patients were discharged, taking the recovery count to 22,992.

In a report submitted in Parliament, the CAG said rule 42 (8) of Chandigarh Motor Vehicles Rules, 1990, provides the fee for temporary registration shall be half of the registration fee as specified in rule 81 of the central rule. The central rule 81 specifies the levy of fee for issue of certificate of registration for vehicles. The report said the ministry of road transport and highways in December 2016 amended the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, and revised the fee with immediate effect. The CAG pointed out Registration and Licensing Authority (RLA) in Chandigarh had issued 98,007 temporary registration numbers to dealers from December 2016 to September 2018 and charged pre-revised rates instead of revised rates. “The non-implementation of revised rates resulted in short collection of revenue amounting to Rs 1.51 crore,” the CAG said. The RLA in its reply submitted it recovered Rs 67 lakh from dealers. The CAG report then cited Rs 83 lakh as the shortfall. However, Federation of Chandigarh Region Automobile Dealers, Chandigarh, filed a petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court against the recovery of the deficit amount. The matter is sub judice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rs-83-loss-as-auto-dealers-not-made-to-pay-new-rates-cag/articleshow/81727813.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Donning the “topi” was a must for Holi revelers. The demand resulted in a turnover of Rs 30 to Rs 40 lakhs. The prevailing Covid-19 pandemic has taken the sheen off Holi this time. These families stare at huge losses as demand has dipped. Naseem Ahmad, a topi-maker , said, “Covid-19 pandemic has eclipsed this vocation. Last year, Holi occurred before the lockdown, so we had decent business. But this year, the demand is nowhere to be seen.” There is no market for these caps in Delhi and UP. Haneef Rahmani, a manufacturer, said, "Topi-making is our art passed down from one generation to the other. We know no other skill. There are several families engaged in this work. Our women and children help us to fulfill the orders given by brokers. But this time, we have no orders for the topi.” Suleiman, another maker, said he did not know what to do with the caps made in anticipation of the demand picking up due to the unlock. “The situation has again started deteriorating. There are heaps of caps in my house. All hopes have dashed. Many of us have run out of savings and are facing huge losses. Earlier, my family earned Rs 10 lakh from this work.” He has now pinned his hopes on the upcoming panchayat elections to make up for some of his losses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/pandemic-takes-sheen-off-amroha-topi-this-holi/articleshow/81727809.cms||Harveer Dabas

From less than 50 tests a day, many centres are now seeing at least 200 tests a day. Experts anticipate the numbers will go up further. Among those who are increasingly getting tested are students, employees at various shops and bankers. Meanwhile, Telangana recorded 495 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday and two deaths. The number of active cases in the state has now touched 4,241. When it comes to RT-PCR tests specifically, centres which were seeing just one or two tests a day are now conducting 25 to 30 tests a day. “I had got an RT-PCR test done last month as part of my office requirement. At that time there was not a single person waiting before me. This time when I went for a test, I had to stand for half an hour as there were about 15 people before me,” said Lasya V, a software professional, who had visited a corporate hospital at Banjara Hills. The government testing centre at King Koti is seeing workers from shops across city markets and students line up for tests. “Employers and shopkeepers are sending their workers in groups for testing. Besides them, students from educational institutes, bank employees and those living in hostels are coming for tests in lareg numbers. Every day we are getting calls from hostel wardens to test their students after one or two tested positive,” said Dr Mallikarjun, from the King Koti Hospital. The testing centre at the hospital had 200 people seeking tests on Friday. “Our out-patients (OP) have increased from 140 a week back to 222 today and we have 100 Covid patients currently admitted,” added the doctor. While the number of samples landing for testing as well as patients are increasing, hospitals are expecting a further spike in numbers by April 15. “Currently, numbers have already increased a lot in Mumbai, Nashik, Aurangabad and are slowly increasing in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. This is the same pattern of increase seen during the first wave too. Right now the increase we are seeing here is sporadic which will gradually spike by April 15,” said Dr PS Rakesh Prabhu, chief medical officer, Medicover hospitals group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fear-of-second-wave-fuels-rush-for-covid-tests-in-t/articleshow/81728840.cms||Amrita Didyala

The railway track at Nangloi was halted and the maintenance wing of the railway immediately sprung into action to repair the track. As per the railway officials who visited the spot, it was a timely and swift action on the part of police and the local person, otherwise it could have led to a major incident. DCP Singh said that the local informer and the police officials are being suitably rewarded for their timely information and action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/told-about-crack-on-rail-track-cops-act-promptly/articleshow/81728846.cms||---
---||Dehradun||18 additional ambulances to be deployed ahead of Holi||DEHRADUN: With as many as 1,115 road accident cases reported between March 9 to March 11 last year, the emergency ambulance services will be more active between March 28 to 30 this year. Apart from regular ambulances, 18 additional backup vehicles will also be deployed in four districts to ensure that every critical patient gets immediate help. Anil Sharma, general manager, (Projects) 108 ambulance services, reviewed preparations on Saturday ahead of Holi. He said that instructions have been given to keep all ambulances ready to cater to emergencies effectively. “Large-scale technical arrangements have also been taken care of to ensure that the ambulances stationed at congested places during Holi are not stuck in traffic. A call centre will keep us updated on the traffic situation so that ambulances can opt for an alternate route, if available. We have also sought cooperation from the police and other concerned departments to ensure smooth vehicular movement around Holi,” added Sharma. The deployed ambulances will also have security personnel to avoid any untoward incidents. The vehicles will be stationed in areas like Survey Check, Ghantaghar, Jakhan, Raipur, Ballupur Chauk, Prem Nagar, Vidhan Sabha and Race Course. Holidays of employees working in all districts, along with 108 Service Headquarters, Dehradun, have been cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/18-addtl-ambulances-to-be-deployed-ahead-of-holi/articleshow/81727824.cms||Ishita Mishra

Though in February this year the directorate of public health had said that at least 31.6% people in Tamil Nadu had developed antibodies for Sars-Cov2 by November 2020 with an estimated 22.6 million infections, the ‘herd immunity’ seems to have had little impact in curtaling the second surge in the state. Over the same 30 days, as per TOI analysis, the doubling period the time taken for cases to double from their current level dropped from 1,267 days to 352 days, indicating a steep rise in infection spread. According to experts, it would be difficult at this stage to predict when active cases would hit a peak before they start coming down. “Going by the trend, we only know that the 31% sero positivity rate had made little difference to the spread of infection,” said National Institute of Epidemiology deputy director Dr Prabhdeep Kaur. While nine deaths on Saturday took the state toll to 12,659, total cases in the state was 8,88,279. Currently, 12,157 people were undergoing treatment for the infection across the state. “We continue to see up to 10% positivity rate in clusters and high positivity rate in urban areas. Last year, we were able to slow down transmission with lockdowns. Now, with no restrictions on crowds and with elections around the corner, conventional tools such as testing, isolation, use of masks and social distancing, will be the only means to pull down the epidemic curve,” Dr Kaur said. She also said more people should be encouraged to take vaccine. “But the effect of the vaccine will be seen only after two weeks of the second dose,” she added. Public health officials say they don’t have data on the number of people coming with reinfection or those who have been infected after two doses of the vaccine. Also, the state is still awaiting results of samples it sent from clusters for genetic testing. “We still don’t know if the virus in circulation is an ‘escape’ mutant,” said senior epidemiologist Dr Jayprakash Muliyil. Escape mutants are variants that will infect people who have already had the infection. “We see newer zones in cities and villages getting affected,” he said. For instance, in Chennai this year, Central and Southern zones are seeing higher numbers of cases compared to zones in the north last year. “We will need more days to confirm this. We may also have to wait for some more time to see if this wave will be more morbid and fatal compared to last year,” he said. On Saturday, Chennai reported 775 new cases and four deaths, the three adjoining districts Chengalpet (186), Tiruvallur (104) and Kancheepuram (82) together added 378 cases. Together the four districts had 55% of new cases and 57% of fresh cases in the state. Meanwhile, with 185 new cases, Coimbatore had the third highest number of cases after Chennai and Chengalpet. While Thanjavur had 66 new cases, Tiruppur had 59, Salem and Nagapattinam and 55 and 51 cases respectively. While all districts reported new cases, eleven districts reported fresh cases in single digits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/in-one-month-tns-weekly-case-avg-sees-four-fold-jump/articleshow/81728849.cms||---

Excerpts:LDF alleges Congress-BJP camaraderie in Kerala. Is it true?BJP aims for a Congress-mukt Bharat and wants to replace us in Kerala. We want to ensure that BJP loses its only seat in Kerala, hence we fielded a strong candidate in Nemom. Allies are BJP and LDF and the soft stance of central agencies in all cases is proof. I think BJP blackmails CPM with these cases for deals in many constituencies. Do you think highlighting the Sabarimala issue in the polls would favour UDF?LDF created Sabarimala issue in the name of new renaissance but changed their stand after its defeat in Lok Sabha polls. Now, LDF says they are with the devotees and support the review petition but its not ready to change the affidavit in the SC. LDF cannot do so as it will be like losing their ‘Leftist’ nature. Do you think the ecological impact, the real issue of Sabarimala, is getting drowned in the women-entry row?Waste management, pollution of Pampa river and the forest that surrounds the pilgrimage centre have to be addressed. Protecting Pampa and the forest should be the priority, and like Thames River Conservation Authority, an autonomous entity should be constituted. The UDF government will ensure that. If UDF forms a government and you are made the finance minister, would you scrap KIIFB as it has claimed?It is not possible to scrap KIIFB as no government can back out from the financial commitments over the last five years. They announced projects worth Rs 65,000 crore but payments have been made for projects of Rs 7,000 crore. The remaining Rs 58,000 crore will be the next government’s burden. Will the free food kits turn into votes in the assembly polls?Kerala’s people cannot be influenced to vote for a party by giving them free food kits. I don’t agree with those who believe LDF had the upper hand in LSG polls because they gave kits. It is an insult to the people as it will be like bribing them. Despite Congress taking up corruption issues against LDF, the government’s handling of the Covid crisis has given them an edge. Your take.The UDF brought into the limelight several issues against the LDF government, starting from the Sprinklr deal to the latest EMCC deep-sea fishing deal. We believe that there is a trend against the government. About Covid, the government could manage it when daily caseload was less, and we already have a strong health system. They failed to do anything when the number of cases increased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/keralas-voters-cannot-be-influenced-by-giving-them-free-food-kits/articleshow/81728437.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||Nagpur||‘Self-study biggest takeaway of learning in Covid times’||Even after schools and college remaining shut for most part of the year, there seems to be no immediate relief in sight. Students who were either hoping to go back to the campus by this time of the year, or those who had already started attending classes wherever authorities permitted them to, now find themselves back at home as Covid-19 cases are on the rise. TOI spoke to Kabir Rawlekar, vice-principal of Dr Ambedkar College (Deekshabhoomi), about the unique situation which students find themselves in. Excerpts from an interview. Q. Around this time last year, no one would have expected that schools and colleges will still remain closed. A. It has indeed been a challenging year for all. Around December, students were hopeful of things getting back to normal by summer, but it seems the situation will drag on longer. I always tell students that they must not fret over things that are not in their control. It’s not as easy as it sounds, but that’s the only way they can carry on till things become normal. Q. Exams, for both boards and varsity, are about to start. And not everyone is able to access online classes, so what can such students do to compete? A. If I have to ever think of one big academic takeaway from Covid-19 then it will be ‘self-study’. This has emerged as the biggest differentiator among those who have been able to keep their academic schedule on track and those who haven’t. An intelligent and determined student will always score well, regardless of school/college being closed or open. For those who aren’t typically coming from an excellent academic background, a lot of effort is required. They have to get into the habit of self-study and make this a daily routine, as if one was attending college or school. There are many in India who might not have had access to online classes due to internet issues or some other reasons. For them, it is tough but we have to make the most of the situation. Books are available, teachers can be reached through phone and the rest can be taken care of by self-study. Q. But staying away from schools, colleges and classmates has also had a negative impact. A. Absolutely, there are many students who find it depressing and it’s not easy to be cut off from all social connections in the physical mode. For such students, it’s important to keep talking to those at home like parents, siblings, etc. Also, stay connected with relatives and friends over the phone at least. As long as there is someone to talk to, negative thoughts will go away. Q. Do you foresee online exams becoming the ‘new normal’? A. In the immediate future, yes, because we don’t know when the government will allow schools and colleges to function like the pre-Covid times. But as soon as everything shifts back to normal, the traditional pen-paper exams will be vogue. There is no substitute for the offline exam because you are guaranteed that every child gets a level playing field. Q. What about classes, will we see a hybrid format of online and offline? A. It will depend on what level of teaching we are talking about, but if I have to take a very broad view then my answer will be no. Offline classes are the best way to teach and learn. When a students sits inside a class, he/she is learning with all the senses in hyper active mode. They are looking at the teacher, following their gaze, noticing their body language, watching their fellow students clear doubts — all this provides for all-round development of students. Learning happens in mental, emotional and cognitive formats and the traditional classroom setting maximizes its impact. In fact, I see an eagerness among students to be back on the campus. Their socializing with peers is a great part of the learning experience as well. In online mode, that’s all gone and has impacted learning. Q. What is the biggest impact online learning has had on students and teachers? A. For teachers, it definitely has to be the initial challenge of technology. Not every teacher was well-versed with Google Classrooms, making, sharing and evaluating assignments online or attending webinars or conducting online classes. After the technical challenges were conquered, adaptation to teaching in a virtual world happened. Everyone started learning by trial and error method and now everyone has a more or less perfect system. For students, the definition of self-study has evolved. Now this word also includes exploring new frontiers within the topics they have studied. Let’s say a particular chemistry practical is mentioned in the book, but now the student cannot go to school. So he/she goes online and watches a video of that practical and comprehends the concept. That research part, to go online for a video, has now been incorporated into self-study and is making students better at learning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/self-study-biggest-takeaway-of-learning-in-covid-times/articleshow/81727822.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Goa||‘Director of municipal admin tried to balance population and rule of rotation’||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa has dismissed a petition by a Mormugao councillor challenging the reservation of ward 24 for women from scheduled tribes.  He stated that he was elected from ward 25 in 2005 and 2015, and intended to contest from ward 24 this election. However, it has been reserved for ST women.  His counsel, advocate Nigel Costa Frias, referred to notings prepared by the director of municipal administration which stated that ward 4 was required to be reserved for ST women and ward 24 was not required to be reserved but left for the general category.  Frias stated that there was an error apparent on the face of the record and there was a disconnect between noting and notification. Advocate general Devidas Pangam stated that Frias referred to notings made by the director, based on which the earlier reservation order was issued. He pointed out that this was struck down by the high court and upheld by the Supreme Court, while adding that the notings cannot be relied upon. The court found that only one seat out of total of 25 seats in the MMC has been reserved in favour of ST category – ST women in ward 24. “The director, in issuing the impugned notification, has attempted to balance the considerations of population concentration and the rule of rotation. Merely because some other combination was possible, cannot be a ground to interfere with the impugned notification,” the court added. The petitioner stated that there are approximately 50 ST voters in ward 24 which was not reserved for ST in 2015 though it may have been reserved for women. “In the year 2021, ward 24 has been reserved for ST women, which is, in a sense, a different category. This is mainly a reservation in favour of the ST category and to that extent, there is no repetition involved or any breach of the rule of rotation involved. Therefore, in this case, we do not feel that the petitioner has established any breach of the constitutional or statutory provision or for that matter made out a case of manifest arbitrariness on the part of the director,” stated the division bench comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Mahesh Sonak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/director-of-municipal-admin-tried-to-balance-population-and-rule-of-rotation/articleshow/81729214.cms||---

The total fine collected by the three agencies since March last year has crossed Rs 46.87 crore. So far, over 23 lakh people have been fined for not wearing a mask. On Friday, the BMC fined 13,689 people, collecting around Rs 28 lakh from them. The police fined 5,000 people, collecting around Rs 10 lakh from them. The railways fined 573 people and collected around Rs 1.14 lakh from them. With the rise in Covid-19 cases in the city, the BMC has intensified its drive to fine those not wearing a mask. BMC data shows it is fining around 20,000 people a day and collecting around Rs 40 lakh on average from them. The police have so far collected Rs 4.34 crore in fines fro not wearing a mask and the railways, around Rs 35 lakh. Mayor Kishori Pednekar had last month instructed the Clean-Up marshals of the BMC to fine those without a mask but not to misbehave with them. There had been several reports of marshals misbehaving and breaking into fights with people. He had asked the marshals to take a photo and video of people who misbehaved with them and to report it to their work supervisors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-rlys-and-police-collect-rs-39-lakh-from-the-mask-less-in-mumbai/articleshow/81729222.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Dehradun||Yogic pranayama, diaphragmatic breathing can help treat glaucoma 20% faster: AIIMS-Rishikesh study||DEHRADUN: A study conducted by AIIMS-Rishikesh has found that glaucoma patients showed 20% faster recovery when they practised yogic pranayama and diaphragmatic breathing. The study was published in World Glaucoma Association journal, and was conducted by Sanjeev Mittal, head of ophthalmology department of AIIMS-Rishikesh. The study performed on 60 patients over a period of two years, showed that people practising pranayama had significantly lowered intraocular pressure compared to those patients taking medicines. Speaking to TOI, Mittal said that glaucoma is the second leading cause of global blindness and the main cause of irreversible blindness due to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Since vision loss is often considered to be progressive and irreversible, patients experience continuous anxiety and fear of becoming permanently blind. “The biochemical changes associated with stress and pathogenesis of glaucoma share numerous common features. Mental stress (acute and chronic) is associated with an elevation in intraocular pressure (IOP) and accelerates POAG. Literature shows that reduction of nitric oxide in blood is associated with glaucoma which is caused due to stress, and at present, medical or surgical lowering of intraocular pressure is the only therapeutic approach for treating POAG. Intraocular pressure maintenance is influenced by autonomic activity (sympathetic and parasympathetic),” said Mittal, adding that among the alternative and complementary therapies, yoga is widely used to improve the quality of life. According to AIIMS-Rishikesh doctors, yogic pranayama and diaphragmatic breathing (YPDB) exercises have been known since ancient times and are one of the most efficient traditional and integrative body-mind training techniques used to calm the body and mind. “Anuloma-viloma pranayama is also called ‘nadi-shuddhi’ pranayama and it is the first of the pranayama practices described in the Hatha Yoga Pradipika. Nadi shodhana translates to “nadi purification” and the practice is believed to balance the subtle energy, or prana, of the energetic body. ‘Yogic pranayama’ and ‘diaphragmatic breathing’ are exercises that can affect autonomic activity by stimulating a wakeful hypometabolic state of parasympathetic dominance. Our study aimed to assess the effect of yogic pranayama and diaphragmatic breathing on intraocular pressure to determine whether it can be recommended for individuals with established glaucoma in combination with glaucoma medication as an adjuvant therapy,” added Mittal. The researchers divided the patients into two categories in which the first 30 patients were asked to use glaucoma medicines continuously while the remaining 30 were given the drugs and were asked to practice yoga — ‘anulom vilom’ pranayama and diaphragmatic breathing. “In the study, it has been discovered that yogic pranayama and diaphragmatic breathing are potential adjunctive therapies for patients with glaucoma. However, they are not substitutes for medicine or eye drops. Weakening of eyesight can be controlled with yoga and even the medication can be reduced if the patient is doing pranayama and diaphragmatic breathing,” he added. “The research paper has been prominently featured in the February 2021 edition of the Journal of Glaucoma, a research journal of the World Glaucoma Association. This paper has also been awarded the ‘best paper of the month’,” said professor Ravikant, director, AIIMS-Rishikesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/yogic-pranayama-diaphragmatic-breathing-can-help-treat-glaucoma-20-faster-aiims-rishikesh-study/articleshow/81727839.cms||Ishita Mishra

The South district has the most sealed zones with 307, followed by 194 in North and 170 in New Delhi. North East district has the fewest with 27, with 31 in Central district, according to a containment zone summary prepared on March 25. A fortnight ago, the number of containment zones had come down to 488. But as the cases of new Covid started rising again, areas began to be sealed in an effort to contain the spread of the infection. Unlike last year, however, a containment zone is a much smaller space, configured in a manner to inconvenience the minimum number of people. A government official explained that such micro demarcations increased effectiveness in managing containment zones and surveillance efforts. So far, 16,986 containment zones have been created in the city, of which 15,679 were reopened up to March 25. Last December saw the sharpest rise, with 2,361 red areas notified in just one month after the third Covid wave led to up to 8,500 new infection cases every day. “All the active containment zones are sanitised and those living within them are screened for infection,” said a district official.

No gatheringA health department official added that each district was tracing 30 to 40 contacts for each individual testing positive and the containment zone was the primary focus in the tracing exercise. Meanwhile, health minister Satyendar Jain appealed to people not to ignore masks. “A direct correlation can be seen in the changing weather and the simultaneous increase in the number of Covid-19 cases. However, it cannot be concretely said that this is the sole reason for the surge in Covid-19 cases,” claimed Jain. “I believe we have been educated on prevention measures and we should follow these without creating a fuss.”  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); The health minister added that Delhi government had fixed the rates of vaccines in the city and would not reduce them further.

Saturday’s 1,558 fresh infections pushed Delhi’s Covid cases tally to 6,55,834, with over 6.38 lakh patients recovering from the virus so far. As per official data, this was the highest number of cases recorded in a single-day since December 15 last year when 1,617 people tested positive for the virus. Active Covid cases, meanwhile, went up to 6,625 on Saturday from 6,051 the previous day. The positivity rate stood at 1.7%, the health department bulletin stated. Ten fatalities were recorded on Saturday, taking the number of deaths to 10,987. This is the highest number of deaths since January 13, when 11 people succumbed to the disease. A total of 91,703 tests, including 59,648 RT-PCR tests, were conducted in the past twenty-four hours, the bulletin stated. The number of people under home isolation rose to 3,708 from 3,312 a day ago. Delhi’s containment zones, too, went up to 1,506. The Covid caseload in Delhi on January 1 had stood at over 6.25 lakh and the total fatalities were 10,557. The number of cases had started to come down in February. On February 26, the month’s highest daily count of 256 cases was recorded. However, daily cases began to rise again in March, and has been steadily increasing over the past few days. Health minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday dismissed any possibility of imposing another lockdown in Delhi, saying it was not a solution to check the spread of the coronavirus that is again surging rapidly. The minister said that there were enough hospital beds available for patients and it could be increased if the need arises. The health experts and doctors have all attributed the “sudden rise” in Covid-19 cases to people turning complacent, not following Covid-appropriate behaviour and “assuming all is well now”. The next two-three months could be challenging, they say, adding that the situation can be kept under control if vaccination is opened for more people and Covid-19 protocols are strictly adhered to.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/death-toll-touches-10-highest-since-jan/articleshow/81728376.cms||---
---||Delhi||Face action for playing Holi in public: Delhi health minister||NEW DELHI: Health minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday advised people to celebrate Holi at home with family and stressed that action will be taken against those who celebrate Holi in public. Delhi government and police are constituting various teams in order to implement restrictions on public gatherings during Holi, Jain said. “I would like to appeal to all that we celebrate the festival within our homes. These festivals will come next year as well, when one can celebrate it publicly. When 50 people meet and come in contact, out of these even if two are positive, the rest would test positive too. Such gatherings must be avoided,” he said. Over rumours about the possibility of lockdown, the minister said, “As of now, there is no possibility of lockdown because lockdown is no solution for Covid-19. We have seen the lockdown, but that did not defeat Covid completely.” In Delhi, on average, 30 to 40 contacts are traced and tested for each Covid patient. In a press conference, the health minister said that the government was gearing up to carry out vaccination of all those above 45 years of age from the first day of the month. The government said it had sufficient number of vaccines available. On Saturday, 1,558 single-day Covid cases were reported and the positivity rate was 1.7%. The positivity rate from the past 2-3 days has been 1.75% and the active number of cases has also increased. “We have increased the rate of testing with around 85,000-90,000 daily Covid tests being conducted. This is five times more than the country’s average testing,” said Jain. Despite the recent surge in cases, around 80% beds are unoccupied. “If required, we would definitely increase the number of beds. There are 500 beds in Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, but the occupancy is only around 20-25. Hence, the number of beds available is sufficient. The rate of occupancy for ICU beds too is 20%, the point being in LNJP where we have 300 ICU beds. Even in Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, out of a total of 500, 300 are ICU beds. So, a large number of ICU beds are being provided and we would increase them if required,” Jain said. The minister stressed the importance of masks in the fight against coronavirus. “Earlier in Delhi, the compliance was really good so the number of cases had reduced drastically, but from the past 10-15 days, it has been felt that the compliance has decreased for which we are trying to adopt strict measures and appealing to the citizens to comply to the rules,” Jain said. The government has started random testing at airport, railway stations and bus terminals. “We’ve started random testing at railway stations and airports. Delhi is the nation’s capital from where people do travel and there have been cases, for instance, where a person travelled from Delhi to Punjab or Maharashtra and while coming back, he was tested positive,” Jain added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jain-face-action-for-playing-holi-in-public/articleshow/81728380.cms||AlokKNMishra

These include teachers, bus, cab and auto drivers, bankers and staff working in bars and restaurants, among others. Also, an alert has been sounded ahead of Holi and other festivals, urging people to avoid indulging in festivities. The need to be doubly careful has been stressed upon by health authorities, in view of the looming second wave. “ Even those who are going to play Holi should be very careful and observe social distancing, hand hygiene and wear masks at all times. It is best to avoid playing Holi,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director of public health, Telangana. The Covid situation in the state is currently under control and the state machinery is prepared to handle a surge if there is one, said health authorities, speaking to reporters on Saturday. The state health department had meanwhile approached the Centre earlier last week asking for vaccines for high exposure groups. Apart from teachers and restaurant workers who had approached the health authorities seeking vaccination, people working in commercial establishment, street vendors and kirana shops will fall in the category. Citing the example of an 80-year-old man who had been recently vaccinated but still contracted the virus, the official further said although getting the vaccine isn’t a complete protection against the virus, it does reduce that severity of the infection to a large extent. “It is better to get vaccinated, as the vaccine will protect against the virus to a large extent by bringing down the severity. We need people’s participation to fight against the virus. The hesitancy against vaccination is slowly coming down and we urge everyone in the beneficiary categories currently being covered to utilize the opportunity and get themselves vaccinated. The vaccines are absolutely safe,” added Dr Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/best-to-avoid-playing-holi-health-director-urges-high-risk-groups/articleshow/81728875.cms||---

The councillor and resident of ward 10 belonging to the ST gawda community stated that the ward was reserved for OBC women in 2019, after it was assigned the general category in 2015, but has now been reserved for ST women in the latest notification. He stated that the ST population in the entire Sanguem municipal area is 5.8% and therefore the maximum of one seat could be reserved for the ST category. He also submitted that ward 10 has approximately 130 voters belonging to the ST community while ward number 5 has approximately 76 voters. He stated that there is no study to determine the concentration of ST population and added that wards 5 and 9 were not reserved for women in the last two elections. The councillor pointed out that ward 7 was reserved for ST category in 2015 and therefore by applying the rule of rotation, ward 8 should have been reserved for the SC/ST category, but instead has been reserved for women. He stated that the rotation policy has not been properly followed. “In this matter, though the petitioner has made allegations about the breakdown of the rotation rule or that the aspect of concentration of population being ignored, the petitioner has failed to make good any of such allegations, particularly in the context of ward 10 of Sanguem Municipal Council from where he had intended to contest the election. The allegations, apart from being vague, are not supported by any material, and therefore, based on such allegations, no case can be said to have been made out to interfere with the impugned notification,” the division bench stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/allegations-made-by-councillor-are-vague-court/articleshow/81729229.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Modi also went to Jashoreshwari temple at Ishwaripur before reaching Orakandi. Modi is the first Indian premier to reach out to the heartland of the Matua community. Matua gurus Harichand-Guruchand descendant and BJP MP from Bongaon Shantanu Thakur accompanied him to the Matua temple in Bangladesh. The Prime Minister’s visit came weeks ahead of the elections in the 10 assembly seats in North 24 Parganas and Nadia, where the Matuas decide the political fate. “Who thought that the Prime Minister of India would come to Orakandi some day? Today, my emotions are similar to what the thousands of my Matua siblings in India feel when they come to Orakandi,” Modi said on Saturday, addressing an audience after offering prayers at the Matua guru Purnabrahma Harichand Thakur temple. The Prime Minister told the gathering that he had wanted to visit this holy place much earlier. “During my 2015 visit to Bangladesh, I had expressed my wish to visit Orakandi, and today, my wish finally came true,” said Modi, who began his speech with “Jai Hari bol”, the popular greeting among the Matua sect. The Prime Minister offered to set up a primary school at Orakandi and to upgrade the existing middle school for girls there. Promising that India would make efforts to make the pilgrimage to Orakandi easier for people from India, Modi said, “This is a pilgrimage of the bond between the people of India and Bangladesh. I am fortunate to have come here. People from India visit Orakandi each year and we will take measures to facilitate the pilgrimage.” Modi impressed the audience by quoting from Matua poet Mahananda Halder’s book, ‘Sri Sri Guruchand Charit’ and held that the Matua gurus had the “divyadrishti and alaukik shakti” (divine power to see the future). “Whatever have been achieved by the scheduled castes are the fruits of a wish-yielding tree, like Harichand Thakur,” he said. The Prime Minister recounted his association with and the warmth he received from the Matua leaders of West Bengal at the Matua headquarters at Thakurnagar in North 24 Parganas. “I remember visiting Thakurnagar in Bengal, where they welcomed me like a family member. Baroma’s (late Matua matriarch Binapani Devi) blessings and her affection remains as precious moments of my life,” Modi said amid a huge applause.  Emphasizing the Indo-Bangla bond, he said: “We are committed to organizing big events and various functions reflecting the glorious history of the Matua sect.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/have-come-on-pilgrimage-pm-in-bangla-matua-heartland/articleshow/81728384.cms||Rohit Khanna

Refusing to let off the accused on a bond of good behaviour, the sessions court said he knew the difference between right and wrong and yet he chose to store gutkha. “This act of the accused (Gautam Khandagle) was (committed) without taking care of health of the people in general and for earning money. His act was against the public welfare and public policy,” judge DD Khoche said. The court held that it was proved that Khandagle had stored gutkha in his shop. “Notification of the Food Commissioner proves that the commissioner had prohibited the storage of the gutkha in the state of Maharashtra,”said the court. While the maximum fine was Rs two lakh, the court said that it was to be noted that he was not a distributor or a big seller of gutkha and was found storing only a small quantity, the full fine cannot be imposed. “Therefore, the punishment prescribing penalty cannot be fully saddled on him but it is proper to take reasonable approach (after) taking into consideration his standard of living,” the court said. The prosecution had submitted that on April 9, 2014, cops received information that gutkha was being illegally sold at Jyoti General Stores and Pan Shop at Malvani, Malad (west). Cops raided the shop and found a plastic bag hooked to the table of the cash counter. The police found 152 packets of gutkha of various brands inside the bag.  Khandagle denied the allegations and said that he was not the owner of the shop. He also claimed that he was selling vegetables on the footpath in front of the shop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/man-gets-6-months-in-jail-for-stocking-gutkha-in-his-shop-in-mumbai/articleshow/81728892.cms||Rebecca Samervel

They are once again warning that lack of social distancing, not wearing a mask in public and ignorance of other prevention protocols could spike Covid-19 infections further. Indian Medical Association, Greater Bhopal chapter, secretary and RKDF associate professor, Dr Sudeep Pathak said, “There was dip in the early part of the this year. The current spurt is an explosive situation. The current jump of 10,000 cases has taken about a week. The first jump to 10,000 cases took from March to October. Vaccine combined by adhering to Covid-19 protocols by all is only way forward.” World Health Organisation (WHO) has acknowledged later that there is a growing body of evidence that even asymptomatic persons can spread the disease. Mobility changes or movement during the pandemic has distinct similarities to last year, when Covid-19 cases spiked. Anonymised movement trends for places like restaurants, shopping centres was up more than 50% during the year. It has declined to by half in the last week, across Madhya Pradesh. Public transport usage including trains and flights was up for in the positive for the first time since December in mid-February. The earlier to increases were reported in first week of November and before the lockdown in March 2020. “It has been noted that when movement increases, it takes about three to four weeks for the infection spike to be noted. It took a good three months of strict restrictions for us to reach some normalcy in the start of the 2021,” said Dr Rajiv Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/covid-spread-more-severe-in-urban-crowded-areas/articleshow/81728400.cms||Jamal Ayub

---||Kochi||Possible surge in Covid cases after polls worries health experts||KOCHI: The Kerala model of Covid-19 management that won laurels globally faces its greatest challenge now. In the run up to the assembly elections, it appears that the state is slowly losing its battle in maintaining Covid-19 protocol to mitigate the risk of transmission. Most candidates and supporters are violating SMS — sanitizing, masks and social distancing — to reach out to voters. Public health experts are worried as this increasing inappropriate behaviour comes at a time when several states are experiencing a second wave of Covid. “Our positive is that the elections are happening in our Covid declining phase. But the negative is that when we study the pattern across the globe, there is a gap of one-and-a-half months to four months between the first and second wave, which we do not expect to get. This is because there is more than normal social and unprotected interaction and we may go for an early second peak by mid-April,” said Dr B Mohammed Asheel, executive director of Kerala Social Security Mission, who was closely involved in the campaign. “Cutting across the party lines, candidates, including doctors, are violating the Covid norms. The only solution is to vaccinate the majority at the earliest,” said internal medicine expert Dr Arun N M, who has been analyzing the Covid death trend in Kerala. Incidentally, the heavy-handed response from the health department and law enforcement officials that was seen during the initial phase of the first wave of the infection is missing now. Though the government has directed collectors to video record election campaigns and share the footage with police and sectoral magistrates to check for violations of Covid-19 protocol, nothing has changed on the ground. Social distancing is a distant dream as candidates are surrounded by party supporters, many of them who don’t wear masks. “This is the time that we need to take maximum precaution as the second wave has hit the country. But the government is sitting like a lame duck,” said public health expert and epidemiologist Dr Raman Kutty. The problem is that using the excuse of leniency during elections, there will be increased demands for more religious and social activities that were so far restricted, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/possible-surge-after-polls-worries-health-experts/articleshow/81728386.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Delhi||Delhi: Traders report 40% decline in festive sale||NEW DELHI: The last-minute ban on Holi celebrations and community gatherings has hit the sales of festival colours, water guns and other items used by revellers. Traders report big declines in sales, while market associations claim the restaurants in their area haven’t get the bookings they normally do during the festival period. At Sadar Bazar, Holi item sellers claimed a 30-40% slide in business due to the restrictions on public celebration of Holi. “Retail traders from Delhi-NCR came here for bulk purchases of water guns, colours and gift items. They aren’t this year, so our headache is how to dispose of the inventory. We faced a similar situation during Diwali last year,” said Devraj Baweja of Sadar Bazar Trader’s Association. “Even those who had booked items for gifting during community celebrations are withdrawing the orders because they can’t hold such events.” The traditional community lunch and the bonfire organised by the traders for their workers a day before Holi too stands cancelled. “During a meeting with Delhi Police officers, we were told that even the bonfire (Holika) on the eve of Holi wouldn’t be allowed,” disclosed Rakesh Yadav of the Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders’ Associations. “On Sunday, there is the Shab-e-Baraat festival when the traders’ associations make night arrangements for their Muslim friends. But that too has been cancelled now. The retail traders are the biggest sufferers because wholesalers sold much of their stocks before the ban announcement.” Murli Mani, president of Beopar Mandal in Karol Bagh, said Holi attracted crowds till last year, but things hadn’t picked up after the outbreak of Covid. “To add to our woes, the state government and police repeatedly impose new restrictions in the market. The shops had all ordered fresh stocks for Holi, but they have no customers,” grumbled Mani. “The news about the growing Covid-19 cases has so frightened people that very few are coming to the markets.” Mani’s colleague in the Beopar Mandal, Sanjeev Kapoor, added, “There’s also the farmers’ blockade on the highways and borders. Buyers from other states are, therefore, avoiding a trip to Delhi. And due to the long weekend, people have planned to leave the city for a break rather than sit and celebrate Holi at home.” Banquet halls and restaurants, normally booked for Holi events, too are losing hope. Rajendra Sharda of M Block Market, Greater Kailash I, said they cancelled their annual function in the market. “The prohibitory announcement has created panic among people and naturally our losses have gone up,” he claimed. Merchants in certain markets, especially retail sellers, however, believe that these restrictions are necessary in the wake of Covid cases spiking. “Things were really crazy in certain places, so we had to write to the authorities to step in and take action against people not wearing masks or violating physical distancing norms,” revealed Ashwini Marwah of the Traders’ Association of Lajpat Nagar. “Sales have not been impacted much, but yes, the authorities have swung into action, which is the need of the hour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traders-report-40-decline-in-festive-sale/articleshow/81728392.cms||Vibha Sharma

Till date, 12 cases were reported within the week. Despite spike in cases in the city and inside the civic body’s office, GHMC — one of the departments responsible for containing the spread of virus in the city has taken few measures to contain the virus. The disinfectant spray machine installed at the entrance of the head office is dysfunctional, several staffers inside the office were found not wearing masks and social distancing was not being followed. Sanitation standards inside the office were poor, garbage was piled up, stains of gutka were spotted at multiple places and spraying of disinfectants was given a miss. The only measure taken by civic body to contain the spread of virus is restricting visitors from entering the head office. Since months, GHMC has not been holding Prajavani, adding to that, the online meeting planned in 2020 to interact with people went for a toss. Since Saturday, GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar decided to ban visitors and restrict media personnel from entering the office. “Only top officials are getting sanitisers and masks, GHMC has turned a blind eye towards ground-level staff,” a GHMC employee, associated with an employee union, said. “We are doing our best to contain the spread of Covid-19, we are also trying to improve online grievance reddressal system. Restrictions are to contain the virus,” said a GHMC official. The ban on people did not go down well with resident welfare associations and activists. As per GHMC records, over 1.6 lakh grievances have not been resolved. “GHMC officials don’t want to meet people. They don’t respond to online grievances,” said Harish Daga, an activist, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/protocol-ignored-even-as-covid-19-cases-surge-at-ghmcs-head-office/articleshow/81728885.cms||Nabinder Bommala

The minister was chairing a review meeting with officials of all districts through video conference here on Saturday and directed officials to ensure there is no panic in schools regarding the pandemic. “Andhra Pradesh is the only state which is strictly following the academic calendar despite the Covid-19 crisis. We are continuing classes following the necessary guidelines and only a nominal number of Covid-19 cases have been registered at schools recently. We should be very cautious over the next two months as officials are predicting a sudden hike in cases,” the minister told officials. The minister expressed ire at corporate and private educational institutions that are not taking precautions against Covid-19. “A total of 168 students at a private college in Rajahmundry tested positive for Covid-19 due to the apathy of the private college management. I direct officials to conduct inspections at corporate colleges to take action against colleges which are neglecting Covid-19,” Suresh added. “Officials should be cautious while revealing details of Covid-19 cases registered at educational institutions. Many parents are panicking with the sudden rise in cases and are hesitating to send their children to class. This will hamper the academic calendar,” the minister said, adding that, “Thermal screening is mandatory before permitting students into classrooms. Students with Covid-19 symptoms should be sent back home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/close-schools-where-covid-cases-are-recorded/articleshow/81727797.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Kolkata||Narendra Modi campaigning for Bengal elections in foreign land: Mamata Banerjee||KHARAGPUR/HOWRAH: Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of canvassing for Bengal votes in a foreign country, chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday questioned why his passport and visa shouldn’t be cancelled. She threatened to move the Election Commission and take the matter to the highest level over how could the PM, after declaration of polls, accompanied by people related to Bengal elections, “speak in favour of votes”. “You say frequently that Mamata Banerjee has brought everyone from Bangladesh and allowed infiltration. And now you go to the same Bangladesh for vote marketing. Who is right and who is wrong? We need an answer. For this, I will go wherever it takes,” the chief minister said. “Aapni Banglae vote cholakalin Bangladesh e (You chose to go to Bangladesh during Bengal polls). You tried to lie to a section of people. You have gone to seek votes. Why shouldn’t your visa be cancelled? Why shouldn’t your passport be cancelled? This is a justified demand,” she said, adding that why should the PM be always exempt from the law, while it was applicable for the rest. “Elections are on in Bengal and you choose to go to Bangladesh and lecture about Bengal. It is a total violation of the election code of conduct. I know this. Law is equal for all and is not discriminatory. Justice is for all,” the CM said. Banerjee cited the passport and visa cancellation of Bangladeshi actor Ferdous Ahmed before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. “Can I ask you a question?” she addressed the people at a rally in Kharagpur. “Ferdous is a film star and he had come from Bangladesh to work in Kolkata. During the last Lok Sabha elections, he had attended an election rally. He told people he was from Bangladesh and wished all well. BJP complained about it. The Indian government spoke to Bangladesh. And later, the Indian government cancelled his passport and visa,” Banerjee said. “Bangladesh is our friend. Still, they ensured that he could not come to Bengal. Film stars from Bengal and Bangladesh work together. Because he attended a rally, you snatched away his visa.” Alleging that the Prime Minister had done a similar thing in the past as well, the CM said, “Don’t you know, he had also tried to seek votes for Trump. He held meetings in support of Trump.” Accusing the Union home minister of trying to run the state’s law and order with central forces, she said, “You run the country, do not try to handle Bengal’s law and order.” The CM alleged Uttar Pradesh police were being sent to Bengal to threaten and intimidate voters in booths. At a rally in the Kharagpur railway township, vowing to protect workers from eviction, Banerjee said if the BJP transferred any railway worker, the ruling government would transfer the party itself. “There is no profit from making threats. I know railways better than others. They say they will evict people from railway land. It is not so easy. No one will be evicted from railway land. They already did it in Siliguri and tried it in Bankura, but I did not let them. The Bengal cabinet has already resolved that there can be no eviction without proper rehabilitation, and if they try it, the state will not give them any support,” Banerjee said. “There are plans to sell and privatise the railway. How many railway workers will be left? Kharagpur is a rail town, 90% of which comes under railway area. If railways are sold, your jobs will be wiped out. What will you eat?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/modi-campaigning-for-bengal-elections-in-foreign-land-mamata/articleshow/81728411.cms||Sujoy Khanra

When the inquiry got under way in the evening, DMK’s principal secretary and Trichy west candidate K N Nehru submitted a letter to the returning officer of the constituency complaining about efforts to spoil his candidature and defame him. Nehru said that fake news has been floated in social media that money had been distributed to police officials in the constituency. “I have submitted a letter to election officials that I am in no way connected with the allegations of bribing,” Nehru told TOI. Sources said top police officials of the city carried out searches in some stations in Trichy west in the afternoon and allegedly found unaccounted cash in covers. Attempts to contact commissioner of police J Loganathan to get his comments went in vain. Nehru who is contesting for the fifth time in the constituency is taking on AIADMK’s V Padmanadhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-west-police-stns-searched-for-cash/articleshow/81728412.cms||Gokul Rajendran
---||Mumbai||Malad global school, investor in tiff over non-payment of dues in Mumbai||Mumbai: An international school in Malad has been asked to vacate its premises by the majority stakeholder, an asset investment company, which alleged that there has been a delay in payment of lease rentals, financial fraud through breach of escrow and wilful default of rent. However, the school’s trust claimed that the investor did not honour the agreement of infusing promised equity in entirety, forcing it to stop all rental. VJTF Infraschool Services (Mumbai) Private Limited (VIS), 56.5% stakeholder, has terminated its lease deed with Pratiksha Foundation Charitable Trust (PFC) for the property and building of Witty International School, Malad, alleging defaults in payment of rent of Rs 12.5 crore, and additional Rs 23 crore for breaking minimum lock-in period of 15 years. The company has asked the trust to vacate the lease premises. The school is affiliated to ICSE & Cambridge Boards and is catering to 1,810 students. However, PFC trustee Vinay Jain said after the agreement, the company invested Rs 47 crore and failed to infuse the additional equity of Rs 51 crore by March 2020. “With no additional funds, we want to terminate the deal. We have invited the company to sit across the table and allow us to settle the matter and buy back stakes. We are also pursuing the matter legally and approaching NCLT,” said Jain. A VIS spokesperson said that as a SEBI fund, they cannot invest more than 25% of their corpus in one entity and hence the decision to go in for a second round of fund infusion was cancelled. “In February 2016, we envisaged that we would raise Rs 500 crore but we could not raise more than Rs 200 crore so the decision to not invest any additional funds was taken in May 2016 itself,” he added. While Jain used to pay Rs 85 lakh as lease rental to VIS, the amount was increased to Rs 1 crore a month later. VIS, which alleged it stopped receiving rentals from December 2019, started defaulting on their loan. In turn, PNB Housing Finance Ltd has served a default notice of Rs 51 crore to Cerestra, which is the majority shareholder in VIS. Meanwhile, as the two companies drag the matter to court, matters may worsen for the Udaipur school too where a similar deal has been signed between the same parties. Witty International’s third campus in Borivali however does not have the same investor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/malad-global-school-investor-in-tiff-over-non-payment-of-dues-in-mumbai/articleshow/81729291.cms||---

---||Delhi||Teacher moves Delhi HC over no salary, others echo her plight||NEW DELHI: A 45-year-old teacher in private school has been forced to move Delhi High Court for the release of her salary pending since March 2020, when schools closed down due to the Covid-19. She did not go to school, of course, but she worked all the while, taking classes online. For the 45-year-old teacher at Gyandeep Vidya Mandir School in Sangam Vihar, the situation is dire because her husband is now without work. While she did not want to be named in this story, she did say there were seven other teachers who have filed a court petition over salaries. “There is word of the school being shut down. But even if a hundred students have withdrawn, there are others who are still on the rolls,” she said. She cannot afford a laptop and takes her classes on her phone. She had a salary of Rs 22,700 prior to the lockdown. This is not just the story of one teacher whose life was impacted by the pandemic, but of many in the smaller private schools or working on contact. There were permanent jobs, salary cuts and no increment. In such institutions, fee collection has been a big problem along with the withdrawal of many students due to migration home by straitened families. TOI reported earlier how the fee collection of budget private schools in Delhi was a mere 25% of pre-Covid times. At Ideal Radiant Public School in Uttam Nagar, the situation is so bad that just two to three teachers have been called to conduct online classes for students till Class VIII. Puneet Tyagi, a teacher, went without salary for several months. “In September, the principal asked me to take classes because I am acquainted with the technical requirement of online teaching,” said the 28-year-old. He is getting only a truncated salary, but understands the circumstances. “At least, I am lucky in getting financial support from my father,” said Tyagi. “There is an elderly teacher who has not received her salary. The school staff are aiding her the best they can. There was a couple similarly handicapped. Fortunately, their daughter recently got a call centre job and eased the pressure,” said Tyagi. He felt the government should facilitate the reopening of the schools. But as a teacher of another south Delhi school mourned, “I have been praying for schools to reopen soon, but it seems unlikely.” Having been allowed to collect only tuition fees during the closure period, a principal argued, “With students of classes IX and XII returning to classes, the government should allow us to at least charge development fees. In fact, our cleaning costs have doubled due to Covid measures.” Even teachers contracted to the government under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan received no salaries for two months in 2020. After they petitioned the government, their contract was renewed last September till January. Delhi government has now engaged many of them as guest teachers. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia even wrote to the Union education ministry asking for their contracts to be extended till the end of the 2020-21 academic session since Sarva Shiksha is a central government scheme. Yet, there are close to 500, mostly primary and social sciences teachers, who are staring at a difficult future. “We don’t know what lies ahead,” said Riya Sharma. Another teacher, now engaged as a guest teacher for mathematics, said, “Though many of us have been accepted as guest teachers in government schools, this tenure will not count in our overall experience. The only consolation is that we have jobs.” While government school teachers hold on to their jobs, there are other challenges from them besides coping with online teaching. As Ravi Singh, a science teacher, said, “Many of us have duties at Covid vaccination centres, so have to find time to interact with our students and help them with worksheet queries.” Singh had earlier been assigned to book people violating precautionary Covid measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/teacher-moves-hc-over-no-salary-others-echo-her-plight/articleshow/81728413.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Trichy||In Trichy East, minister counts on son-of-soil tag to work wonders||Trichy: A visit to Trichy east assembly constituency will make one ponder whether it comes under the jurisdiction of Trichy city corporation, for it remains underdeveloped without even basic amenities. The segment, presently represented by tourism minister Vellamandi Natarajan in the assembly, has elected ruling party MLAs since 2011, but key demands remain unaddressed. While Natarajan faces an anti-incumbency wave, he seems to enjoy an edge in his campaign style — which refers to his rival DMK and AMMK candidates as rank outsiders to the constituency. He projects himself as son of the soil, a more accessible candidate. DMK candidate Inigo Irudhayaraj hails from Chennai while AMMK’s R Manoharan belongs to Srirangam according to their affidavits before the EC. Covering Rockfort, Big Bazaar Street, Trichy airport and K K Nagar, Trichy east should have been a completely urbanised segment. However, there is no proper drainage network in the constituency not to speak of lapses in potable water distribution. “Public transportation is in tatters, there is no direct connectivity between the city’s neighbourhoods,” laments P Sugumar, a resident of EB road. The constituency has remained caste neutral so far as even a candidate from a non-dominant caste was elected to the assembly. It also boasts a significant minority vote bank. Residents rue that though the tourism minister himself represented the seat, Trichy’s landmark Rockfort hillock has not received any significant tourism development initiative. East Boulevard has been yearning for public transportation for a decade now. In his campaigns, the minister has been gloating over the inability of his rival parties to find local candidates to combat him. However, his rivals claim that the minister has nothing significant in the constituency to show as his achievement as MLA and minister.  “I completed my education in this constituency. The outsider tag is a deviation tactic, it will not work out as I have been residing here for the past 40 years,” Inigo Irudhayaraj, the DMK candidate, told TOI. He said he will focus on decongesting cramped localities and improving employment opportunities for youths besides resolving the grievances in basic amenities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/in-trichy-east-minister-counts-on-son-of-soil-tag-to-work-wonders/articleshow/81728414.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Delhi||Delhi: North corporation gears up to vaccinate more people from April 1||NEW DELHI: Expecting heavy footfall from April 1 at vaccination centres when people above 45 years will be allowed to get the jab, North Delhi Municipal Corporation has strengthened its arrangements. It has planned to increase the number of vaccination stations at each hospital from two to six. Staffers, including nurses, civil volunteers, guards and school teachers, have been assigned and trained for their respective duties by the Delhi government. “Preparations have also been made to increase the size of observation/waiting areas besides augmenting water, toilet, fans and related facilities,” said mayor Jai Prakash. These arrangements were inspected by Union minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday. Prior to this, a dry run was also carried out at the centres. There are four hospitals (Hindu Rao, Girdhar Lal, Balak Ram and Kasturba), 29 maternity and child welfare centres and three polyclinics in north corporation areas, where vaccination centres are running. Dr Dinesh Negi, the nodal officer for the vaccination programme in the north corporation, said that as of now, the footfall was not much. “With two stations in each hospital, the target was to cover 400 people but not more than 230-250 people were coming for the vaccination. We are expecting a rise in numbers after people above 45 will be allowed to take the jab. All preparations have been made to run the facilities in two shifts — 9am to 3pm and 3pm to 9pm,” the doctor added. As of now, only people above 60 and those above 45 with comorbidities are allowed for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-corpn-gears-up-to-vaccinate-more-people-from-april-1/articleshow/81728422.cms||Vibha Sharma

In a press communique, Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) stated that Sitabuldi market street (flagship) and Sakkardara Lake neighbourhood streets will soon be transformed into pedestrian havens and vibrant public spaces. The initiative will be executed in association with urban designers Sumit Asia Architects, Nagpur and Blank Slate, Mumbai and Manorambai Mundale College of Architecture, Nagpur, who won the first prize for flagship and neighbourhood site, respectively, in a competition on street design by NSSCDCL. TOI had highlighted the issue of making Sitabuldi main road into pedestrian street on March 11, 2018. On Friday, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari announced the winners of the street design competition. The competition provided an opportunity for top urban designers, young professionals, and students to create pedestrian-friendly streets through innovative, inclusive, and quick solutions. NSSCDCL will now seek inputs from citizens on the winning entries and further refine them before implementing the design on pilot basis through tactical urbanism. NSSCDCL chief executive officer Buveneswari S said the winning design for Sitabuldi market will help in creating pedestrian streets in the high footfall area while the Sakkardara design assists in revitalizing dead spaces and regeneration of economy in the neighbourhood. In-charge general manager (environment division and nodal officer streets for people) Pranita Umredkar said the competition was very tough as the jury and evaluation criteria was set as per the ministry guidelines. NSSCDCL selected its top five design solutions of which 1st winning design will be tested on both the sites as a pilot intervention. NSSCDCL is working to make both the streets for pedestrians only by restricting movement of vehicles for sometime during the day, said Umredkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/buldi-sakkardara-lake-surroundings-to-be-pedestrian-friendly/articleshow/81728426.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Now, Covid vaccination 7 days a week in Punjab||CHANDIGARH: To expand the coverage of the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive, the Punjab government has decided to carry out vaccination on all seven days of the week and increase the number of sites where the jab is being administered. Any photo identity card will be considered valid for vaccination and health officials will not insist on a particular identity proof. These decisions were taken during a meeting chaired by Punjab chief secretary Vini Mahajan, via a videoconference, to review the Covid situation in the state and the status of the ongoing vaccination drive. She directed all departments to ramp up the pace of vaccination to cover as many people as possible. She also said there was a need to strictly enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour. Referring to the Union government’s recent approval for vaccinating all persons aged 45 years and over from April 1, Mahajan asked health and other departments concerned to rope in more private facilities for increasing the ambit of the ongoing drive. She also directed the health department to hold vaccination camps to reach the doorsteps of people with the vaccine. “All arrangements should be in place till March 31, before the inoculation drive for persons aged above 45 years starts from April 1, so there is no hitch at the last moment,” said Mahajan, while instructing the health department to target eligible vulnerable sections of society, like journalists, shopkeepers, government employees and especially those who were engaged in public dealing.  Punjab director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said the police were on their toes to curtail the spread of the virus and as many as 90,363 face mask violators had been taken for Covid testing in the state so far. In a week, more than 18,500 violators were issued challans for not wearing masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/now-covid-vaccination-7-days-a-week-in-punjab/articleshow/81728427.cms||---

A source in the state government said there was a discussion to keep the rates unchanged as of now, taking into account the pandemic crisis and the overall sentiment of the real estate market. An official communication from the government on maintaining status quo on ready reckoner (RR) rates is expected next week, the source said. “The real estate market has started to get buoyant now. It is unlikely that the government would want to disturb it,” said the source. A senior state government official in the know of developments said that the registration department was working on preparing the RR rates after due consultation and assessing rates area-wise. But the government is unlikely to make changes now, he added. The RR rates for residential and commercial properties based on location are announced on April 1 each year.

---||Chandigarh||Active Covid-19 cases touch all-time high mark in Punjab||CHANDIGARH: The trend of steady upward curve of fresh cases has pushed the total number of active cases in Punjab to an all-time high mark since the start of the pandemic. Punjab touched the highest ever count of 23,271 active cases on March 27. The previous highest, 22,399, was recorded on September 19, 2020, during the peak of the outbreak. The state now has over 10% active cases – many times higher than the national average of 3.77% and second highest in the country after Maharashtra, where 10.70% of the total positive cases are undergoing treatment. The average daily positivity of the last two weeks has been recorded as high as 6%. The grimness of the situation can be gauged from the fact that it took 45 days during the peak of August to September last year for active cases to go up from 5,000 to over 20,000. Whereas in the current month, the same number of cases were accumulated in just 24 days. The other worst-hit states with cumulative cases more than Punjab are faring better. Kerala, the state with the second-highest infection count, has 2.17% active cases, Karnataka 1.99%, Andhra Pradesh 0.46%, and Tamil Nadu 1.29%. Even the neighbouring state of Haryana that has a higher cumulative positive case count has 2.73% active cases. Mohali district, which recorded the highest positivity rate of 12.94% in the last week, has 3,064 active cases, while 3,109, 2,568, 2,405, and 2,313 patients are undergoing treatment in Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Patiala, and Amritsar, respectively. Despite a high number of active cases, the health authorities can heave a sigh of relief as 64.4% are in the home isolation, 6.6% in level-II facilities, while the condition of only 0.8% of patients is serious and require critical care. To meet the rising demand due to the surge in cases, the government has further bolstered the existing facilities by more beds for treating patients. Even as the majority of beds at levels II and III facilities remain unutilised, the government has added more beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/active-covid-19-cases-touch-all-time-high-mark-in-punjab/articleshow/81728424.cms||Vinod Kumar
---||Pune||Fashion Street fire a fallout of failure to act||Pune: Around 11pm on Friday, a fire ripped through the smorgasbord of apparel stores in Camp’s Fashion Street. The blaze destroyed more than 600 stalls and damaged property worth Rs90 lakh. No casualties were reported. A few old buildings made of wood, tucked away in a small lane behind the market, suffered some damage. The residents had to be evacuated. A short circuit is suspected to have caused the fire, though the Pune Cantonment Board said in a statement on Saturday that the cause was unclear. Most of the stalls had unsanctioned electricity connections. Around 30 fire tenders and three water tankers were jointly pressed into service by the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations, PCB, Armed Forces Medical College and Supply Depot. As per the PCB statement, two quick-response teams too were dispatched. The fire was brought under control around 2am, and finally doused at 8am on Saturday. “Sixty personnel were involved in the operation,” PMC’s chief fire officer Prashant Ranpise said. The Cantonment police and fire brigade officials said flames and smoke were seen at one end of the market around 11pm and rapidly spread across the site. “We could not reach the spot in time because of the narrow and congested lanes. Stalls blocked the entry points, forcing us to park the fire tenders and tankers a distance away,” Ranpise said. Adding to the chaos were onlookers and panicked vendors. “Some vendors even snatched water hoses from our personnel to save their stalls. This was unexpected and unacceptable, and hampered our efforts,” Ranpise added. In 2018, Ranpise had inspected the premises and submitted recommendations on improving fire safety at the market. Police inspector (crime) K Jamble from the Cantonment police station said the chaos and darkness hampered crowd control. “More than 2,000 people had gathered around the area. We had to call for reinforcements to control the situation,” Jamble said. The police closed all roads leading to the market after photos/videos of the fire went viral on social media. Jamble, who recorded the statements of the vendors, said, “Based on our inspection and the statements, the total loss stands at around Rs90 lakh.” Some vendors suspect arson. “Many people wanted to shut down the market and take over the land,” Mohmmed Shaikh, who runs a garment stall in the market, said. Salim Sayyed, another vendor, agreed. “There was no fire all these years; each vendor undertook fire safety measures. The police should investigate the possibility,” Sayyed said. Inspector Jamble declined to comment. “We are still collecting CCTV footage from nearby areas. We haven’t reached a conclusion,” he said. Bhagat Taur, president of the Fashion Street Shopping Centre, sought compensation from the government. “The market was the main source of income for thousands of people. It was shut for almost six months last year and we suffered huge losses,” Taur said. M V Akolkar, advocate and president of the Fashion Street Hawkers’ Association, laid the blame squarely on PCB’s “mismanagement”. He said another problem was the power supply — the market was initially running on a single MSEDCL electric meter. Later, several hawkers had installed their own connections without PCB’s permission and faced no action. Senior inspector Ashok Kadam from the Cantonment police said he raised the issue of illegal stalls, as well as complaints of petty theft and public nuisance, with PCB officials a fortnight ago. “The officials said they could not take action because of the court case,” he said. This was the second major fire incident in the cantonment area in the past 10 days — a blaze destroyed 25 chicken/fish shops and gutted a 5,000sqm area at the Chhatrapati Shivaji market on March 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fashion-street-fire-a-fallout-of-failure-to-act/articleshow/81728434.cms||Sandip Dighe

Bank president Avinash Kothale, who chaired the 20th annual general meeting, held online on Saturday, received heavy brickbats from angry members, which forced him to keep the item pending. Members asked him to stop acting in a dictatorial manner and criticised him for bringing on the table an item that they said was "undemocratic and unconstitutional". Members strongly opposed the move to cancel membership of directors and members who dared to ask the board to set right the discrepancies in various loan cases and other matters, or approached courts or complained to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) after the board allegedly neglected their grievances. "Having majority does not mean that you should behave in a dictatorial manner," the members thus sounded the chair. The meeting, that lasted for seven-and-a-half hours, saw members grilling the chair on several issues that raised doubts over the bank's functioning. Falling profits, growing non-performing assets (NPAs), misleading statistics on loan position and a dubious policy for new membership were the issues on which members expressed their concern. The members also asked the chair to start respecting Maratha Sewa Sangh (MSS) members who approached the bank for membership. When the chair did not accept that the bank was set up by MSS members, the members turned angry and condemned him for acting vindictively against four of the bank's directors. A large number of members complained about the bank not giving written replies to their queries before the start of the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/jijau-co-op-bank-members-oppose-proposal-to-stifle-dissent/articleshow/81734547.cms||---

When stopped by police, as per the state government orders, transporters in Batinda disrupted vehicular traffic outside the bus stand here and parked their buses haphazardly. In Amritsar, chaos reigned supreme on roads as many commuters did not know about the orders. The state government, through deputy commissioners, on Friday issued an order for not plying vehicles in towns on Saturdays from 11am to 12pm, except on national and state highways, to observe maun (mourning) for an hour. Bathinda transporters termed it as a step against business interests and opposed the move. As traffic was disrupted, hundreds of vehicles were stranded on the road. During the road blockade, a wedding car and vehicles of the Indian Army too were stranded. “We had faced big losses due to lockdown and various restrictions. It was only some time ago that our business started returning to normal. But now we are being stopped from plying buses for an hour. It is not only a matter of one hour, but the entire schedule gets disturbed by it. The government should look for other measures to contain Covid,” said the president of a local association of transporters, Sunny Dhillon. In Amritsar, when people didn’t pay heed to the no-movement order, police laid the barricades on bypass roads and main city squares, resulting in traffic snarls in the holy city. “You can’t force me to pay tributes to anyone; it should come from within. I have sympathy for Covid victims. If the government wants to pay tributes, then it should instruct its leaders or bureaucrats to follow instructions,” said Gusewak Singh, a businessmen who had to reach the Amritsar bus stand to receive his wife, but was stuck in the traffic jam. A few commuters said they were not even aware of the government’s new directions. “This is a new kind of announcement and the goverment would have to pay for it in the assembly elections,” said Pawan Duggal, who was struck at Mall Road Chowk in Amritsar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/pause-traffic-hour-tribute-to-covid-casualties-slammed-by-commuters/articleshow/81728430.cms||---

According to the police, the incident took place around 2.30am on Friday when the two men, who had gone to a restaurant, were leaving the mall in Aerocity after dinner. While leaving the parking lot, one of the accused’s car scratched against the other’s vehicle while he was reversing.

With this, people will no longer have to carry a physical copy of factory, trade or other licences at shops or municipal offices during the renewal process. So far, only death and birth certificates have had QR numbers to avoid duplication and obtain information about the person after scanning the code. The same facility will be given in eight other categories — cattle dairy business, factory, health trade, meat processing plant, meat shop, factory household, general trade & storage and tehbazari. It will also help check the authenticity of the documents, an official said. “Now all the new licences, which are being issued or renewed, will be embedded with a QR code. The facility will help in getting all the background information about owners, their property/animals and status of payments in the past by simply scanning the code. On the other hand, traders can keep a soft copy of the licence,which can be verified by the municipal field staff through QR scanners during inspection. The data of the licences issued or renewed will be available on the web portal of the corporation,” said mayor Jai Prakash, adding that, “In case of tehbazari, the facility will be available for renewable as no new licences are being issued.” Leader of the House Yogesh Verma said all the field inspectors had been informed of the development through respective deputy commissioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpn-to-issue-qr-based-licences-in-8-categories/articleshow/81728431.cms||---
---||Goa||Population not been ignored, reservation not repeated: HC||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday dismissed a plea challenging the reservation of a seat made without ascertaining the concentration of the population of OBCs in the 20 wards of Mapusa Municipal Council. The division bench comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Mahesh Sonak stated that “no question of arbitrariness is involved. The population concentration has not been ignored and at the same time reservations, to the extent possible, have not been repeated”. “According to us, though it may be true that no policy as such may have been placed on record by the director when it comes to rotation of reserved seats, no case of any manifest arbitrariness has been made out by the petitioner to warrant interference with the impugned notification,” he stated. The petitioner, Sarfraj Huddar, submitted to the court that there is no policy formulated by the director of municipal administration and that the director failed to ascertain the concentration of population of OBCs in the 20 wards of the MMC. He stated that no proper census or survey was undertaken to determine the population of OBCs in the MMC. The petitioner stated that for the 2015 elections ward numbers 2, 4, 5, 15, and 19 were reserved for OBCs, while in the latest elections ward numbers 1, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 17 have been reserved for OBCs. Counsel G Panandikar representing the petitioner argued that the latest reservations dated March 15 are “arbitrary” and “lack logic”, while advocate general Devidas Pangam defended the notification stating that the earlier one was struck down by the high court and that the director issued the new one by following policy of rotation where most of the wards were reserved for the year 2015 have been excluded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/population-not-been-ignored-reservation-not-repeated-hc/articleshow/81729278.cms||---
---||---||Kerala assembly elections: It’s old school versus young blood||PALAKKAD: As the moderator starts introducing Metroman E Sreedharan, there is complete silence in the air-conditioned auditorium and even those who were glued to their phones listen attentively as details of a life marked by many worthy achievements unspool before them. A young girl gets up from the audience and in chaste Malayalam recites a small sloka and goes on to talk about how she met Sreedharan at a function to honour him in Ernakulam a few years ago. “Today, all my friends are interested in my constituency because Sreedharan sir is contesting from here,” says Sreelakshmi. “They ask me whether my city is also now on the fast track to development.” Sreedharan has been keeping his campaign the way he planned it. There is added pressure on the party’s district leadership to reach out to every voter and micro-manage the poll campaign. After all, the ‘top leadership’ is looking for nothing short of a grand victory. “We need to bring in a new work culture. When projects are planned, it should be done within the costs planned. You can’t squander public money by postponing projects for years- a bypass takes 40 years to get completed, and one RO-RO, five years. For Palakkad, I have a development plan and I will be around to ensure that it gets done,” says Sreedharan, whose campaign is centred around meetings with smaller gatherings enhanced by social media in contrast to door-to-door and shop-to-shop efforts of the other two fronts.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Though both UDF and LDF believe Sreedharan’s style of campaigning will not fetch him “political” votes, they are not taking him for granted. While the constituencies in Palakkad district have always favoured LDF, the popularity of UDF’s two-time MLA Shafi Parambil and the fact that BJP bagged the municipality in the recent elections have raised questions about its “winnability” this time. All three sides in the triangular contest throw around numbers and specificities like rural-urban and panchayat-municipality divides. While two panchayats are with LDF, one is in UDF’s control and BJP leads in the municipality but by a margin of only 2,600 votes. LDF’s advocate C P Pramod comes from a political family his grandfather Kunhiraman master had served as Malampuzha MLA and father E Padmanabhan was the MLA of Sreekrishnapuram. As state secretary of All India lawyers’ Union, he also enjoys the support of the lawyer community. On whether consolidation of minority votes will help UDF, he says: “There’s no such consolidation in Palakkad. We have only “political consolidation” here. Though BJP has won the municipality, it does not have much presence in panchayats,” says Pramod. “In the past nine elections, only the elections in 2016 have been different. So don’t read too much into it. There were several factors other than the Modi wave that helped UDF to win and Shobha Surendran to come second. It is just an aberration,” says Pramod. The issues being raised at the local level are on the state of public utilities. The congested roads and traffic, state of the KSRTC bus stand, the condition of the Town Hall, water scarcity are among those issues highlighted by all parties. Though sitting MLA Shafi Paramambil’s candidature had faced opposition from AV Gopinath, he has been pacified. A familiar and local face, Shafi’s youth and vigour are drawing crowds and he is confident of a repeat of 2011 and 2016. “I have been here with the people of this constituency as one among them. They know me and have approached me for all their needs. As an opposition MLA, the government has always dilly-dallied on the projects that I proposed. In fact, on the KSRTC building construction, the minister has on record in the assembly acknowledged that I had made an all-out effort for its revival,” he says. The constituency has caught the nation’s attention. Amit Shah and Rahul Gandhi have already finished one round of campaigning. Sitaram Yechury and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are scheduled to arrive on April 30. The roadshows will be kicked off for the last push even as there is no respite from the scorching summer. While BJP is banking on Sreedharan, LDF is resting its hopes on the government’s “excellent performance”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/kerala/its-old-school-versus-young-blood/articleshow/81728442.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Load-testing, however, stands deferred till after the polls. The police are weary of a repeat of the traffic chaos that was caused when the bridge was partially closed for three days on February 19, especially with VVIP movements lined up in the run-up to the Assembly elections. But despite the poll season constraints, Kolkata Police has made allowances to facilitate the Metro construction, granting traffic block on Doljatra and Holi nights (Sunday and Monday) along the western flank of the 30-year-old Ambedkar bridge, which is crucial to vehicular movement of EM Bypass near P C Chandra. Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), implementing agency of the 32km New Garia-Airport Metro corridor of which the Ritwik Ghatak Metro station is part, will have to work all night to assemble FOBs. The FOBs on the other side of the station were built while KMDA, keepers of EM Bypass and responsible for the upkeep of city’s bridges, load-tested Ambedkar bridge for three days in February. There was unending traffic snarls during that time. “Since our work will be done during the night, that too, when there’s less traffic because of Doljatra and Holi, we were given the traffic block by the traffic department after much persuasion,” a senior RVNL engineer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ambedkar-bridge-flank-shut-for-2-nights/articleshow/81728443.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The programme marked the first of a series of celebrations in eastern India. Los Angeles-based musician Bhai Anantvir Singh Ji performed on the occasion and was among a slew of dignitaries from different states who attended the centenary celebrations at Sant Kutiya Gurdwara in Bhowanipore. The organisers said around 500–700 persons attended the two day programme where everyone was instructed to don masks and maintain social distancing protocols to check the spread of Covid-19. “Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji’s unparalleled and supreme sacrifice to uphold the value of righteousness, truth and freedom of faith and humanity is a lesson to be remembered not only by Sikhs, but by every citizen of India, as he stood against oppression by the then rulers. In today’s time, such a lesson becomes even more important. We see people yelling themselves hoarse over extremely inconsequential matters and more importantly, in today’s time, religious freedom has become even more constricted,” said Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, chairman of IHA Foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-celebrates-sikh-gurus-birth-anniv/articleshow/81728447.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||More than half Telangana PSUs are in the red: CAG||HYDERABAD: Even as protests against the Centre’s decision to privatise loss-making public sector undertakings (PSUs) such as Visakhapatnam Steel Plant continue, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said 53% of Telangana state PSUs were making losses due to various reasons. In a report, the CAG said 47 PSUs have submitted accounts for auditing. Of them, 25 are in losses, 17 are making profits and five companies are neither making profits nor losses. The accumulated losses of all the state PSUs stand at Rs 38,000 crore as on March 2019. Both the Centre and the state government had invested Rs 1,33,055 crore in the form of equity, loans, grants and subsidies in these PSUs. The state’s investment was to the tune of Rs 52,219 crore. The CAG report said of the 82 state PSUs in Telangana, eight were of power sector and the rest 74 related to various other sectors. Among these, seven are government companies. “Some state PSUs are facing huge losses. TSRTC is one such loss-making unit owing to low occupancy and facing tough competition from private bus operators. Both Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Ltd (TSSPDCL) and Telangana State Northern Power Distribution Company Ltd (TSNPDCL) incurred losses due to rise in operational costs and mounting dues. There was not enough financial support from the state government in the form of subsidy reimbursement,” a senior government official said. The CAG said losses of the eight power PSUs have been mounting since 2014. “When Telangana was formed in 2014, the losses of power utilities like TSSPDCL, TSNPDCL, TS Renewable Energy Development Corporation and other utilities were to the tune of Rs 1,900 crore. Now, they have risen to Rs 5,433 crore. Both TSSPDCL and TSNPDCL alone incurred a loss of Rs 8,018 crore out of total power PSUs’ losses of Rs 28,000 crore in the past six years,” the report said. The accumulated losses of the other 39 PSUs and companies stand at Rs 10,617 crore. The report said major profit-making PSUs during 2018-19 were Telangana State Forest Development Corporation Limited, Telangana State Mineral Development Corporation Ltd, Telangana State Warehousing Corporation and Telangana State Technology Services Ltd. These profits were negated by the loss of Rs 928.66 crore reported by TSRTC, Hyderabad Metro Rail Corporaton and Telangana Drinking Water Supply Corporation (Mission Bhagiratha Corporation). “The state government is providing drinking water without collecting any tariff from the people while a huge amount is spent on the project. The Centre has not given any financial assistance for the project. Similarly, the HMR does not have any revenue except financial support from the government,” a senior CMO official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cag-more-than-half-t-psus-are-in-the-red/articleshow/81728918.cms||Koride Mahesh

During an election campaign for UDF candidates at Puttady in the district, Gandhi said that Nyay scheme is to bring prosperity to the poor. “When money is deposited into the account, it will come to the state economy and increase job opportunities. The scheme is announced in consideration of poor man’s welfare. It is a concrete plan to boost the economy,” he said. “Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan is in the driving seat of a car without petrol. He tries to start and accelerate it, but the car is not moving. This is the real situation of the state economy,” Gandhi said. “The chief minister reads the ‘Das Capital’ by Karl Marx. But he didn’t get an answer. The reality is that there is no answer in it,” he added. “The UDF government will assure a minimum fixed price for cardamom, rubber, milk, coconut and other major crops,” he added. “This country was peaceful, harmonious and respectful to each other. But now it is hateful and divided. People do not support the hatred ideology. Erumeli temple and Vavar mosque is a unique example of deep-rooted communal harmony in Kerala. But now this idea is under threat and RSS is trying to destroy religious harmony,” Rahul said in Erumeli. Rahul also attended poll meetings at Adimali, Thodupuzha and Erumeli. Idukki DCC president Ibrahimkutty Kallar, Poonjar UDF candidate Tomy Kallani, Peermade candidate Cyriac Thomas, Udumbanchola candidate E M Augusty, Devikulam candidate D Kumar, Idukki candidate K Francis Gegore, Thodupuzha candidate P J Joseph and Idukki MP Dean Kuriakose were also present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nyay-scheme-will-boost-economy-rahul/articleshow/81728446.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Judge of the special court, Ram Sudh Singh, allowed the government counsel to withdraw the case, related to fomenting trouble during the clashes in 2013. The case pertains to the Nangla Mandaur mahapanchayat that was held on September 7, 2013 in which the BJP leaders were alleged to have incited violence through their speeches. Giving details, district government counsel Rajeev Sharma said, "In 2013, a case was registered at Sikheda police station by the then station house officer (SHO) Charan Singh Yadav, and the matter was pending before the court of ADJ-5. A year-and-a-half ago, proceedings of returning the case were initiated by the government.

Soon after the mahapanchayat, communal riots erupted across the district. As many as 40 people, including a bunch of BJP leaders, were booked. About one-and-a-half year ago, Union minister Sanjeev Balyan and other BJP leaders met Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and demanded withdrawal of the cases from court, saying the previous Samajwadi Party government had filed false cases.

---||Pune||2018 safety audit exposed glaring faults; none fixed||Pune: Three years ago, Pune Municipal Corporation’s chief fire officer Prashant Ranpise helped prepare a scathing report on Fashion Street, highlighting an alarming number of shortcomings, essentially calling it a death trap.Subsequently, a legal tussle ensued between Pune Cantonment Board and the vendors and many of those problems went unaddressed.On Friday, a devastating fire raged in this very location for nine hours. Ranpise, who was part of the firefighting effort, said the personnel had trouble even reaching the spot because of some of the very factors flagged in the 2018 report — congested passageways, blocked entry points and cramped premises.A preliminary investigation suggested that the fire was caused by a short circuit, though an official statement issued by Pune Cantonment Board said the cause was “unclear”. The conflagration nearly engulfed nearby buildings and required the residents to be evacuated.The 2018 report was commissioned in the wake of the Kamala Mills fire in Mumbai that claimed 14 lives. The joint team of PCB and PMC fire officials found a catastrophe waiting to happen in the cramped confines of Fashion Street, with almost non-existent fire preparedness in the complex or the buildings around it. Illegal electricity connections were a major red flag too.“The market does not have stall-wise metered electricity connections. Stalls across the market used loose wiring to draw power from a single meter. Some stalls have unsanctioned power lines,” Ranpise told TOI.Further, the stalls were made of highly flammable material, not to mention their wares (apparel), which too could catch fire easily. “There was no direct path from either MG Road or East Street for fire engines. All the stalls were temporary structures, and many were built using highly combustible material such as wood and PVC. No a single stall had a fire extinguisher,” Ranpise said.(With inputs by Sandip Dighe)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2018-safety-audit-exposed-glaring-faults-none-fixed/articleshow/81728450.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Periya double murder case: CBI to quiz accused, CPM leaders||Thiruvananthapuram: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has tightened its noose in the probe in the Periya double murder case as it is all set to interrogate the accused, who are in jail, and some of the CPM local leaders. The CBI court, Ernakulam, has granted permission to the agency sleuths to interrogate the 11 accused, who are in jail and are CPM activists and sympathisers. CBI sources said that the dates for interrogation will be finalized once it receives the court order. All the 11 are currently housed in Kannur central prison. The agency, after launching investigation into the murder of Youth Congress activists Sarathlal and Kripesh, had expanded the scope of investigation to several CPM local leaders, including Kanhangad block panchayat president K Manikandan. The agency had also conducted raids in the party’s area committee office in Uduma and the branch committee office in Kalliyot, and had seized several documents. Crime branch had filed the chargesheet in the case on May 20, 2019, against 14 accused persons under sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 326, 201, 212, 120B, 118 and 302 read with 149 of the Indian Penal Code. However, the high court pointed out several lapses on the part of the crime branch while handing over the case to the CBI. As CBI took over the case, it registered the FIR for re-investigating the case and submitted it in the chief judicial magistrate court in Ernakulam on October 23, 2019. Even when the agency was fighting a legal battle against the state government that had opposed the handing over of the case to the agency, the CBI had twice filed remand extension of those in custody, recorded the statements of the victims’ parents, and collected call detail records (CDRs) of the accused and suspects. CBI would use the original case diary to investigate the lapses, whether it is intentional or unintentional, and if found intentional, the investigating officer would also become part of CBI’s list of accused. The CBI team had also recreated the murder of the two Youth Congress men at the incident site, as part of its investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/periya-double-murder-case-cbi-to-quiz-accused-cpm-leaders/articleshow/81728461.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The top cop, who has taken up a mission to crack undetected murders several years old, also named ‘don’ Ranjeet Saphelkar as the mastermind of Shrivas as well as the Eknath Nimgade murder case, which is being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Shrivas was murdered in 2012 but only an offence of kidnapping was registered in 2016 as his body was not traced. City police has also invoked murder charges in the case this week, taking into custody Bharat Hate and his brother Sharad alias Kalu. In the same case, Saphelkar’s trusted aide Hemant Gorkha was arrested on Saturday. Sources said Saphelkar, still on the run, had planned the murder after learning that Shrivas had accepted ‘supari’ to eliminate him. CP Kumar said Shrivas was lured by Chhotu Bagde on the pretext of some work, to go with him to a desolate place near Kalamna and old Kamptee, where the assailants were waiting for him. “Shrivas was murdered and his body was chopped into pieces, which the assailants packed in a sack and disposed of. The clothes were burnt in a furnace,” he said. The police chief has announced Rs1 lakh cash reward to crime branch under addl CP Sunil Phulari, DCP Gajanan Rajmane and their team. “Family members of Shrivas have also shared crucial evidence and clues in the case, though they were initially frightened,” said the top cop. He added that the assailants had showed cops the places where the murder had taken place. Kumar also said CBI had been collecting evidence in the Nimgade murder case against the suspects, who are yet to be placed under arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/goon-shrivas-was-murdered-then-named-as-an-accused-in-another-case-cp/articleshow/81727920.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kochi||Kerala assembly polls: With 60,000-crore projects, LDF hard sells development||KOCHI: It is difficult to ignore the LDF government’s blitzkrieg of its developmental narratives and welfarism. But, are these just tall stories that are unfounded? Or will the LDF be able to actually deliver what they promise if they get a successive second term in office? In his budget speech, finance minister T M Thomas Isaac had quantified the achievements of his government over the last five years. The LDF government had disbursed Rs 32,034 crore as pensions, against Rs 9,011 crore of the UDF government. Apart from pension, LDF is banking on food security to cajole the lower-middle class and poor households. While the UDF spent Rs 5,242 crore on public distribution system, LDF has spent Rs 10,697 crore till the last budget. However, LDF is betting big on the developmental agenda it had pushed through the last five years and are promising to deliver the same if voted to power again. And figures are in their favour during 2011-16 the UDF government renovated 7,780km of roads while the LDF government modernized 11,580km roads during its tenure, with a further 4,530km yet to be completed at the time of the budget. Much of the fund-raising infrastructure and industrial infrastructure development was carried out through Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). As of February 2021, there were 816 KIIFB-approved projects with a cumulative project cost of Rs 40,401 crore. The maximum number of projects were in PWD (377), sports and youth affairs (37), general education (116), higher education (46), water resources (85) and power (15). Of these, the big tickets were in PWD (Rs 17,375 cr), general education (Rs 2,428 cr), health (Rs 3,128 cr), IT (Rs 1,413 cr), power (Rs 5,200 cr), water resources (Rs 5,178 cr). With three more land acquisition projects added to these, the total outlay for development projects touches Rs 60,401 crore. Now, the question is how far these grand plans have succeeded? Till the end of September 2019, KIIFB had raised Rs 3,755 crore from various sources, including Rs 2,150 crore through masala bonds listed on the London Stock Exchange. Till the budget, KIIFB had completed projects worth Rs 7,000 crore and going forward, projects worth Rs 15,000 crore will be completed during FY22. With KIIFB raising funds through extra-budgetary means of financial market support, will it be possible to continue with the current momentum? “The LDF government has created a ‘fiscal illusion’ where the state is a borrowing and spending entity, rather than a taxing and spending entity,” said Jose Sebastian, former senior faculty, Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT). K K Krishnakumar, senior fellow, Centre for Socio-Economic and Environmental Studies (CSES), said that the KIIFB model is an innovative one which brought the state out of the vicious cycle of declining capital expenditure and the low repayment capacity. “However, if the KIIFB model has to be sustainable, there should be a tremendous effort on the financial management side as well as in retaining the credit rating of the state and that will be the job left to the next government,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/with-60k-cr-projects-ldf-hard-sells-development/articleshow/81728449.cms||Shenoy Karun

Subsequently, 121 more vendors were allowed to set up stalls. As per the 1997 agreement, no vendor could store merchandise in their stalls.The market — initially referred to as Kamble Maidan — was meant to be in effect only for 11 months. Over the next 24 years, till Friday’s devastating fire, it had turned into a bustling shopping destination.“After 11 months were up, the hawkers refused to move, and it led to many legal battles. Business continued and it eventually was dubbed Fashion Street,” PCB elected member Atul Gaikwad, whose ward contains Fashion Street, said.In a statement on Saturday, PCB stated that a 2018 inspection by its revenue and engineering departments found “569 authorized stalls” and approximately 63 illegal stalls.Vendors and officials alike blamed Friday’s disaster on an ongoing legal tussle — following the damning 2018 fire safety report, PCB in 2019 moved the district court to annul the 1997 agreement.

Ganpat Gaonkar, an SBS member, said, “We are not encroachers, the houses and the properties are of our ancestors and we must get absolute ownership. I hope that this yojna will start very soon as it will be beneficial to a large number of people.” The members further said that the government will have to face dire consequences if demands pertaining to the issue of their land rights in Sattari taluka are not resolved before January 26, 2022. Another SBS member Ranjit Rane said, “We condemn the act of Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane and Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane for not taking up the land rights issues in the assembly session, as it was their prime duty,” he said. “Currently the value of the houses is zero in most of the parts of Sattari due to lack of ownership documents. If a person has a house worth Rs 40 lakh, its value is still zero as the owners have to give an undertaking in their respective panchayat or municipality stating that if any complaint is filed against their construction then the owner has to demolish the house at his own cost,” Ranjit said, adding that other land issues should also be taken up on priority basis.

With both festivals coinciding at the same time, police authorities have appealed to people of both communities to celebrate their festivals harmoniously without disturbing law and order. For this, the district has been divided into five zones, 14 sectors and 43 sub-sectors. The administration has deployed special police pickets and force at all sensitive and highly sensitive places. Giving details, additional superintendent of police Pavitra Mohan Tripathi said one company of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) has been sent to the divisional headquarters while all 14 police stations in the district have been directed to keep tight vigil in their respective circles. As many as 35 police pickets have been set up at the district headquarters. Nine mobile units comprising one sub inspector, eight constables, including women constables, and four home guards each have been kept ready to move to any place in case of any disturbance, he said. Tripathi added that 21 of the 1,261 spots where Holika dahan bonfires will be lit have been declared as “highly sensitive” while the remaining will be deemed as “sensitive: due to the celebration of Shab-e-Barat on the same night. Adequate numbers of police personnel will be deployed at the bonfire points, added the ASP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/pilibhit-steps-up-security-for-holika-dahan-shab-e-barat/articleshow/81725832.cms||Keshav Agarwal

The fire safety audit of the hospitals were conducted in January after the fire at Bhandara hospital earlier this year. Officials said while most hospitals had met the fire safety norms, they were required to submit detailed compliance reports in the next two days. “If any recommended works remain to be done, the hospitals will have to complete them in the next 10 days,” a civic official said. Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “After the Bhandara hospital fire, our teams had visited the hospitals to conduct checks. The hospitals were told to fulfil the requirements that were lacking. We are now seeking the compliance reports, which are expected in the next two days. We will issue notices to hospitals which fail to take corrective measures in the next 10 days.” PMC deputy commissioner Rajendra Muthe said a meeting was held on Friday, in which instructions were issued to the fire department and officials from other departments to review fire safety norms and compliance reports of the hospitals. Prashant Ranpise, chief fire officer at PMC, said, “Private hospitals are expected to conduct the fire safety audit and submit the report to our department. We inspect the report at the time of annual licence renewal. Most norms have been met by the hospitals.” He said the audit of civic-run hospitals was conducted recently. “Some suggestions were made,” he said. Health activist Abhijit More said, “A detailed and time-bound audit should be done of each hospital. To do this, the fire department has to get adequate manpower, technical support and expertise.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-seeks-compliance-reports-from-hospitals/articleshow/81728457.cms||---

Those violating the diktat, the order stated, will be subjected to strict punishment — even imprisonment. “Wearing masks is one of the most important interventions to prevent Covid-19 infection. It is mandatory to wear masks in all public places, workspaces and public means of transport across the state,” the order, issued by Telangana chief secretary Somesh Kumar read. It added: “Any deviation in this regard shall attract prosecution under Section 51 and 60 of Disaster Management Act 2005 and Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant)”. According to Sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, anybody found obstructing an officer or employee from performing duty will be imprisoned for a term, which may extend to one year or fined, or both. To ensure strict implementation of the mask rule, the government issued directions to all collectors, district magistrates, commissioners and superintendents of police in the state to keep watch, while also imposing restrictions on public gatherings, congregations, rallies and processions during the upcoming religious events. “Congregations pose considerable threat of rapid transmission of Covid-19. Therefore, it is decided that public celebrations/observances should not be allowed in the state during religious events such as Shab-e-Barat, Holi, Ugadi, Rama Navami, Mahavir Jayanthi, Good Friday and Ramzan, till April 30,” a second order by the chief secretary read. Violations to these directives too will lead to punishment under Sections 51 and 60 of Disaster Management Act 2005 Section 188 of the IPC and other applicable laws, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wear-mask-or-go-to-jail-warns-t-govt/articleshow/81728945.cms||---

However, vacancies in the fire department of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) remain. According to activist Vivek Velankar, 55% sanctioned posts in various categories are vacant in PMC’s fire department and these need to be filled on priority. Velankar had sought details of vacant posts at the fire department under the Right to Information Act. “The government has now given the go-ahead to fill some posts, but it should sanction recruitment on the remaining posts as well.

---||Pune||Air India flyers to Lucknow hassled for -ve reports, allowed to board last minute||Pune: A large number of flyers set to travel from Pune to Lucknow aboard an Air India flight were hassled on Saturday morning before boarding the aircraft for not carrying negative RT-PCR reports. Interestingly, the flyers alleged that neither the airline or the Pune airport authorities had informed them about the regulation beforehand. Consequently, the passengers entered a heated argument with the airline staff at the airport. The flight (AI717) was to take off from Pune at 10.45am but the flyers were only allowed to board at 10.40am after heated arguments and the inability of the airport staff to produce any circular mandating a negative RT-PCR test report. An Air India official, when contacted, didn’t say much. “We will have to check when the fresh order arrived. However, the passengers were allowed to board the flight,” the official said. “Even if there is an order regarding RT-PCR reports being mandatory, the same should have been communicated to the flyers via any medium by the airline. There also needs to be some plan in place for flyers travelling because of emergencies,” a passenger said. Flyer P Bhatt said, nothing was mentioned about a mandatory negative RT-PCR report during ticket booking or web check-in. “If it is a fresh regulation, why were the flyers not intimated about it? For around two hours, close to 50 passengers kept arguing with an Air India official who wouldn’t listen to anything. The staff just kept on saying that there was a circular to this effect but couldn’t show it. There was a passenger who had an emergency back home and had booked the flight at 2.30am,” he said. “I made it a point to call the Pune airport authorities twice, checked the Air India website and called airline officials to know whether a negative RT-PCR report was required to travel to Lucknow. All officials said the the report wasn’t needed. My 72-year-old mother, who was travelling, called me sometime after I had dropped her at the airport and told me that she was not being allowed to board the aircraft without a negative report. She also told me that there were several other passengers like her,” Pune resident Manish Punjabi told TOI. A tweet enquiring about the matter was addressed to Lucknow airport officials but their response was awaited till the time of going to press.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/air-india-flyers-to-lucknow-hassled-for-ve-reports-allowed-to-board-last-minute/articleshow/81728465.cms||Joy Sengupta

I have looked up recipes for Holi delicacies, such as gujiya and malpua and plan to make them on the weekend. This year, Holi will not be about throwing colours or partying with friends, it will be all about celebrating with your family.” Going digital There are a couple of apps that can help ring in the festivities. “Everyone’s timelines are filled with photos of faces smeared with colour. If you also want to post a photo with colour on your face without actually having to play with colours, there are a number of apps such as iHoli or Holi Photo Editor, or Let’s Play Holi which you can download and edit your photos to look like you’re having a ball at a Holi party,” said Shubham Ghosh, an IT professional. “To set the mood for a party at home with your siblings, friends or folks, you can find the perfect playlist on the apps, too,” said Richa Deokar, content writer. “There are a number of Holi-themed games such as water balloon game, match the colours, splashing cars, and so on,” said Chetan Pawar, a marketing executive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/this-year-celebrate-holi-at-home-with-family-friends-food-oodles-of-fun/articleshow/81728470.cms||---

Hasbe and his team were the first to reach the market, minutes after the fire broke out there late on Friday night. He co-ordinated with the Pune Municipal Corporation and other fire brigade authorities and spent the whole night at the spot. Senior inspector Gajanan Pawar from the Airport police said, “Hasbe rode his scooter via Jail Road and Sanjay Park, and reached 509 Chowk around 6.15am. The driver of the PMPML (Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited) bus coming from the opposite direct lost control over the vehicle and hit his scooter.” Pawar said the bus dragged Hasbe a few metres before it stopped. Critically injured, Hasbe was rushed to Sassoon General Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. The hospital in its advance post-mortem report certified the cause of Hasbe’s death due to multiple injuries. “Investigations revealed that the bus hit the scooter at a turn. The detained bus driver told the police that the scooter rider had hit the bus and that he was not responsible for the accident,” he said. Pawar said, “We have registered an FIR against the bus driver for causing death due to negligence under the relevant sections of the IPC and Motor Vehicles Act.” The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB)’s chief executive officer, Amit Kumar, told TOI, “It was tragic and unfortunate. We have lost a very sincere and dedicated officer. Hasbe had discharged his duty at the Fashion Street market.” The PCB’s electric department head, Vijay Chavan, said, “Hasbe had joined the board after retiring from the Indian Air Force in 2002. He is survived by his wife, son and daughter. He was known for maintaining work ethics.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcb-fire-chief-dies-in-collision-with-pmpml-bus-after-dousing-fashion-street-flames/articleshow/81728472.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘A third force will definitely emerge in the state’||Google map says that the distance between Manjeswaram and Konni is 514km, and the fastest road route would take 14 hours to reach from one place to the other. It is exactly why the BJP chose to offer the services of a chopper to its state president K Surendran, who is contesting in two constituencies. He divides his time equally between the two constituencies. He spoke to TOI at Manjeswaram. Excerpts: Why did you choose to contest from both Manjeswaram and Konny simultaneously? In Manjeswaram BJP was defeated by fraudulent ways and deception last time, for a narrow margin of 89 votes. For this reason, the BJP activists here wanted me to contest this election from here. For the party, it is a challenge to win the constituency. When it comes to Konni, there is an emotional connection with respect to the Sabarimala issue. Our party also took into consideration the demand from the workers and mothers there. By deciding to contest in two places, haven’t you given a chance to your opponents to criticize you for lack of confidence? Never. If that was the case, why did K Karunakaran contest in Nemom and Mala simultaneously? In 1965, B Wellington contested from two constituencies. Was it because he thought he would not win that our Prime Minister Narendra Modi contested from two places last time? Contesting from two places is for reaping appropriate benefits at those two places. What are the real prospects of the BJP in this elections? It is the BJP that is going to become the crucial force in the state. The BJP-led NDA would make inroads in such a way that the other two fronts will feel it difficult to survive here. Has the rejection of the nominations of BJP candidates in Thalassery and Guruvayur come as a setback to the party? Of course, it has caused difficulty to our party workers in those places. But it is not going to affect the party in other places. Wouldn’t such incidents be counted as the negligence or mindlessness on the part of state leadership of your party by the national leadership? No, it will not be considered so. These incidents happened because the returning officers failed to take a mature decision, as technical errors are not usually considered as the sole ground for declining the nomination papers. Hasn’t the party’s image taken a beating due to several issues while finalizing the candidates, like the criticism raised by R Balashankar? There is no question of such trivial incidents denting the party’s image. Individuals might have been willing to go ahead with their interest to contest in one or the other place. But the party took the decision collectively for all the constituencies eyeing the larger interest of the state. The prices of petrol, diesel and LPG are spiralling up day by day. Why do you think the public will vote for you as this is causing lots of hardships to the public? The petroleum prices will not be a factor here in the elections. If that is the case, how could BJP win in other states? BJP had ferociously attacked the government when the gold smuggling incident came out. But there is a criticism now that the party has compromised with the CPM for electoral gains. What do you say? Such allegations are absurd. If that was the case, why did the chief minister choose to move against the central agencies and register a case? The government is going ahead legally to make things difficult for the investigating agencies. Even today, revelations about the involvement of the speaker and the chief minister have come out. Investigating agencies are taking their own time as they are probing without any prejudice. In every election, the BJP claims that it will be the BJP surge in this election. But it does not happen, and then the party comes up with excuses that it was because the CPM and the Congress joined hands to defeat the BJP. Is it going to be the same story this time too? I can say with confidence that by this election, a third force will definitely emerge in the state. The adjustments between the CPM and Congress is a fact. For example, in the case of Nemom, Congress fielded a strong candidate not to win, but to help the CPM win. BJP won a seat for the first time in the last assembly elections. How does the party rate the performance of O Rajagopal? His age is a major factor. He has done a lot in terms of development for the people of Nemom. He could convert Nemom into the most developed constituency in the state. Do you think that language is a major factor in Manjeswaram? Language is of course a major factor here. For those who are not well versed in languages, it is a problem in this part. Though all the people here speak all the languages, Kannada and Tulu have an emotional connect to this place. The UDF has alleged that you had not intervened when Karnataka closed its borders near Mangaluru citing Covid-19 cases? The border was never closed. We had intervened too. It was after the whole matter was settled that the other fronts came up with their support. It was a drama by them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/a-third-force-will-definitely-emerge-in-the-state/articleshow/81728479.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Thiruvananthapuram||The Sabarimala spectre haunts Konni||T’puram: All the three political fronts view Konni in Pathanamthitta district, where the Sabarimala shrine is located, as a “must-win” assembly constituency. While BJP wants to prove it has benefitted from Sabarimala, CPM is keen to retain the seat to establish that it took the correct stand on the contentious issue. For Congress, it has to wrest from LDF the seat which it has been winning since 1996 before losing it in the 2019 by-elections. The constituency came into being in 1965. Congress leader Adoor Prakash won the seat in 1996 and went on to represent the constituency for 23 continuous years. In the bypolls held in 2019 after Prakash quit as MLA to contest in the Lok Sabha polls, K U Jenish Kumar of the CPM won. Now, it has fallen upon Robin Peter, handpicked by Prakash, to recapture the seat for the UDF. “I have won several elections in my life. But this is going to be the biggest one in my life,” says Peter, who is now representing Pramadom division in Pathanamthitta district panchayat. Though initially there were differences in the district Congress over Peter’s candidature due to his proximity to Prakash, issues have been settled now. It was DCC president Babu George who inaugurated Peter’s election convention in Kalanjoor. “Robin Peter is Adoor Prakash’s choice,” says the announcement coming from campaign vehicles. At Kuttimon, the crowd gathers to take a group photo with Peter. Close by, at Koodal Junction, the cultural cell of BJP is staging a street play. With BJP candidate K Surendran dividing his campaign time between Manjeswaram and Konni, the party is depending on such activities to maintain the tempo of the campaign. The conversation between actors playing the characters Oommen Chandy and Pinarayi Vijayan touches upon Sabarimala, gold and solar scams in a bid to bring them back into public attention. And as the actors continue their chit-chat, they hear a devotional song on Lord Ayyappa. It is the ring tone for the “Pinarayi” on the stage, who says he replaced his old ringtone with the new one when polls were notified. The situation seems to be not as bad for Vijayan and CPM candidate Jenish Kumar as it is being made out to be. Just a few kilometres from here at Konni town, thousands have gathered in the scorching heat awaiting Vijayan’s arrival. Kumar gives an impressive speech as the wait continues for the chief minister. People cheer when he says he wants to make the new medical college hospital in Konni the best in the state. He elaborates on other promises, including Ponkunnam-Punalur NH and transforming the Aanakkoodu (elephant training centre) in Konni a world-class tourist spot. The chief minister finally arrives, sending the crowd into a frenzy. Addressing the crowd, Vijayan says the huge turnout ensures the LDF candidate’s victory. The high number of Ezhava votes in the constituency is expected to be decisive and may turn advantageous for Jenish. Peter is hoping that the NSS stand on Sabarimala will benefit him apart from the support from Christians. Surendran too exudes confidence that BJP will win this time. “I am personally attached to Konni and Sabarimala is an emotional issue,” he says. He is also keen about the proposed Sabarimala airport. “There is enough land in Konni for an airport. This will be much better than the one proposed at Erumeli,” says Surendran. While LDF rules nine of the 11 panchayats, UDF controls the remaining two. BJP has members in Konni, Kalanjoor, Pramadom, Vallickode, Malayalappuzha, Mailapra, Chittar and Enadimangalam panchayats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/the-sabarimala-spectre-haunts-konni/articleshow/81728484.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

In this case, the military’s release medical board (RMB) had denied disability pension to a retired junior commissioned officer of Subedar rank on the grounds that the disability was caused to him while being posted in a peace station and not during posted in field, high altitude or counter-insurgency area. “We find that the RMB has denied aggravation to the applicant only by endorsing a cryptic sentence in the proceedings i.e., the disability has occurred while applicant was posted in peace station and prior to this posting, he also served in area located at in peace station and disability being originated in peace area with no close time association with stress/strain of service in field, high altitude area and counter insurgency operations. We feel that such a discrimination between peace posting and a posting to field... amounts to saying that there is no stress and strain of military service in peace area, which is not the absolute truth,” the AFT has observed. “It is trite law that any disability not recorded at the time of recruitment must be presumed to have been caused subsequently and, unless proved to the contrary, to be a consequence of military service. The benefit of doubt, therefore, shall be rightly extended in favour of the applicant. In the instant case, since the applicant was found to be suffering from disability when he had put in more than 29 years of service, it should be deemed to be aggravated by military service,” it added. The AFT’s Lucknow bench comprising its judicial member Justice Umesh Chandra Srivastava and administrative member Vice Admiral Abhay Raghunath Karve has passed these orders while allowing an application by a retired Subedar of the Army. The applicant was enrolled in the Indian Army in February 1985 and after having served for more than 29 years, he was discharged from service on completion of terms of engagement in low medical category on January 9, 2014. Prior to discharge from service, applicant was brought before the release medical board (RMB) which assessed the applicant to be suffering from ‘diabetes melitus type II’ @ 20% for life ‘neither attributable to nor aggravated’ by military service (NANA). Disability pension claim preferred by the applicant was rejected in February 2014. His appeals against rejection for disability pension were also dismissed in March 2016. Aggrieved from this, he had recently approached the Lucknow bench of AFT. His contention was that he was enrolled in the Army in medically and physically fit condition and there is no note in his service documents with regard to suffering from any disease prior to enrolment. It was also submitted that his disability pension claim was rejected in a cavalier manner without assigning any meaningful reason. Further submission of counsel for the applicant was that since the aforesaid disease is due to stress and strain related rigours of military service, these should be considered either attributable to or aggravated by military service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cant-discriminate-on-disability-of-soldier-caused-at-peace-station-or-field-posting-aft/articleshow/81728481.cms||Ajay Sura

---||Shimla||Manali-Leh highway may open today after 4 months||MANALI: Closed for over four months, the 428km-long Manali-Leh highway is expected to open on Sunday as the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is close to achieving road connectivity between Baralacha and Sarchu. BRO sources said the official opening of the highway could be announced on Sunday. Snow clearance continued through winter this year. While snow from Leh-Sarchu section had already been cleared, snow from Sarchu-Manali section had also been cleared roughly. BRO jawans are now engaged in the widening of roads at some bottlenecks between Zingzingbar and Sarchu, where snow depth is 5ft-20ft. The final snow clearance is expected to finish on Sunday. Seven oil tankers also headed for Leh from Lahaul on Saturday, but couldn’t move beyond Zingzingbar. A BRO official said they were still clearing snow and widening road, and once task is complete, bowsers could move ahead. He, however, did not disclose the official date of opening of the road. This was also unclear whether the highway will be reopened only for military vehicles or also for civilians as it will be announced by BRO top officers after official opening of the road. Vehicles carrying essential supplies, including fuel and ration, and military vehicles are sent on priority after opening of the highway which becomes one-way at some places due to high walls of snow. Civilian vehicles are allowed after a few days. A large number of tourists are also waiting to hear announcement of official opening of the highway. This will be the first time that Manali-Leh highway will open before Srinagar-Leh highway. Early opening of the highway is contributed to many factors, including less snowfall, Atal tunnel bypassing Rohtang Pass, and BRO keeping large section of the highway clear of snow throughout winter season. BRO will keep clearing snow to widen the highway in the next few days. The highway was blocked in November following heavy snowfall. It generally opens in May or June, but this time it is set to open two months in advance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/manali-leh-highway-may-open-today/articleshow/81728486.cms||Suresh Sharma

Nadda who arrived in the state on Friday night was speaking at a roadshow at Chakkarakkal in the Dharmadom constituency in Kannur on Saturday. He was in the district to campaign for CK Padmanabhan who is contesting against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “If I talk about the Sabarimala issue, it is only BJP which has been consistent. It was our president Surendran and leaders like Padmanabhan who have been fighting tooth and nail for the cause of the Sabarimala issue. But then the CPM, the CM himself tried to crush the agitation. The Congress merely did lip service and now they are saying that they will bring an ordinance. I would like to say that in the coming times, BJP would be a force to reckon with and is going to decide on the fate of Kerala and issues like this,” Nadda said. He added that he saw fear in people at Kannur because of the criminal politics of CPM. “When I move through the streets of Kannur I see people who are afraid because of the criminal politics of CPM, which has been going on for a long time. Now, the time has come to shed your fears, come forward and vote for the BJP,” he said. He said that both UDF and LDF who have come to power in the past were corrupt. “When I talk about the solar scam of UDF it gets associated with Saritha and when I talk about the gold scam of LDF it gets attached to Swapna. The Chief Minister’s office is also involved in the gold scam and enquiries are going on. At one point in time, the chief minister himself said that central agencies should come. But when the investigation reached the Chief Minister’s office, they started saying the central government was trying to act through the central agencies. So, we have to say no to the corrupt politics of Kerala and get rid of the LDF and UDF,” said Nadda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/bjp-alone-was-consistent-in-the-sabari-issue/articleshow/81728489.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It came as BMC decided not to extend the licence of Sunrise Hospital, which ends on March 31, unless its submits an NOC and gets a permanent occupation certificate (OC). Civic officials said flames spread across, made it difficult to bring it under control. The blaze was extinguished at 3.29pm on Saturday. Fire-fighters said there were many challenges, like picking up Covid patients, battling smoke and glass pieces from the mall facade falling on them. A senior civic official who inspected the mall and Sunrise Hospital on Saturday said the fire may have broken out at a commercial gala on the first floor. “The first floor is gutted but the hospital on the third floor is not burnt. Fire brigade is investigating the cause, it could be due to a short-circuit. The third floor where the hospital is located, is intact,” the official said. Police have booked mall owners Rakesh Wadhwan, Nikhita Amit Singh Trehan, Sarang Wadhwan, Deepak Shirke, Privilege Healthcare Services, Sunrise directors Amit, Nikhita, Sweety Jain and others. Police said the hospital was run by Nikhita and George Path Sherri, and they are probing if the hospital management had taken proper precautions, and if there was negligence on their part, deputy commissioner of police (PRO) Chatainya S said. Mumbai municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal on Friday ordered a probe and sought a report in 15 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mall-blaze-put-out-in-40-hours-case-against-6/articleshow/81729315.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Bhopal||Plane crashlands in Bhopal, miraculous escape for trio||BHOPAL/NEW DELHI: Wheat fields on the outskirts of Bhopal played saviour to an aircraft crew, cushioning their crash-landing on Saturday afternoon and ensuring they walked out alive. The crew of three — captains Ashwani Kumar and Raj Kumar and Asim Texali, director operations of Pinnacle Air — has been discharged from hospital after first-aid. Sources say the pilots did a fantastic job of keeping the crippled aircraft away from densely populated residential areas near the airport. All three are from Delhi. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is probing this accident. The Pinnacle Air P68 Observer-II aircraft (VT-TAA) had taken off from Bhopal for Guna, with captains Ashwani and Raj at the controls. Barely 8-10 minutes later, around 4pm, the pilots reported trouble and contacted Bhopal ATC for emergency landing. “About 46km from Bhopal airport, the crew reported unfavourable winds to ATC. According to Pinnacle Air, the crew observed fluctuation in oil pressure during cruise and decided to return to Bhopal,” said a senior DGCA official overseeing the probe. The plane couldn’t make it to the runway and crashed into a field near Bishankhedi village, about 8km short of the airport, said a Raja Bhoj Airport official. “The aircraft reported downwind. Immediately thereafter, radio contract with ATC was lost and the tower could see smoke. All three on board were injured but are safe and have been taken to hospital,” said a DGCA official. Villagers began the rescue effortVillagers working in the fields were first on the scene and began the rescue effort. Gandhinagar police station SHO Arun Kumar told TOI that a Dial 100 patrol vehicle saw the crash and police teams were on the spot in 10 minutes. The pilots and Texali were taken Hamidia Hospital. Bhopal airport director Anil Vikram said everyone survived the crash and is safe. Doctors said none of them had any major injuries. “They were discharged after minor first-aid,” said a Hamidia doctor. The trainer aircraft was to operate a positioning flight from Bhopal to Guna. It was maintained by Sha Shib Group. The DGCA has sent a team from Mumbai to Bhopal for preliminary investigation. A disaster was averted as the pilots managed to avoid residential localities. “I think the pilot knew he could not handle the plane anymore and tried to land in the field to avert collateral casualties,” said an official. The aircraft was destroyed. Villagers told TOI they couldn’t believe their eyes when they saw the plane crash. “We were working in the fields when we heard the plane flying rather low. It seemed like it was out of control. We saw it crash. Thankfully, no one was working at the exact spot and none of the three men in the plane was badly hurt,” said villager Ghanshyam. Another villager said that residents in nearby localities were spooked by the bang when the plane crashed and ran into their homes. “The noise of the crash was very loud. It is good that no one was seriously hurt.,” said Bansi Ram, a villager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/plane-crashlands-in-bhopal-miraculous-escape-for-trio/articleshow/81728482.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Trapped in web, students yearn to return to school||NEW DELHI: A year away from school, and children are grumbling that they have had enough of online classes. They miss their lunch sessions with friends, playing with them, and, at this particular time, the raucous Holi revelry. They can’t wait to go back to school, which, if the rising Covid-19 cases hadn’t created a scare, would have been from April 1. Yuvraj Rekhi, Class VII student at KR Mangalam World School in Greater Kailash II, wistfully said, “School used to be so much fun, playing on the playground, doing science experiments.” He is most sad about not being able to celebrate Holi with friends. “I missed my favourite festival last year and looks like it’s going to be the same this year too,” said Rekhi, sighing about the growing boredom of having only online games as an option. Evvah K Mittal, who studies in Class V at The Shri Ram School Aravali in Gurgaon, self-deprecatingly admitted her engagement with online games had “gone off-limits”. “I am trying to curb this habit,” said Mittal, wishing that she could return to the days of school bus trips, assemblies and hugs from teachers and friends. From tennis and romps in the park to board games and indoor activities mark the closure of classes for Samya Jayachandran, Class VI student of Mater Dei School, India Gate. “Instead of outdoor games, I had to draw comics and play hide and seek in the house with my brother,” shrugged Jayachandran. She misses a lot about school. “How I wish I could once again play with my friends and share lunch with them!” Jayachandran ruminated. “What also used to make me the happiest every year was celebrating my own and my friends’ birthdays in school.” Like most students, Jayachandran now desires to resume physical classes. “Online classes are not good as too much screen time is bad for us and also eats into our TV time,” she reasoned. “Since I have to spend a lot of time on the laptop, my parents have restricted my TV hours.” Class IX student Kuhu Aiejaz of Springdales School, Pusa Road, too wonders about how much they are absorbing through e-lessons. “Online classes are great and our teachers do their best to make classes interesting and interactive. The online assemblies are also great,” she admitted. “But I am not sure we are learning as much as we used to in physical classes.” Aiejaz conceded, however, that online sessions are inspiring creativity in students, and many of her friends are being felicitated by the school. The Class IX student missed the winter carnival a lot. “How we used to dance on the school’s annual day! And we spent some great time together on amazing trips,” she reminisced. Aiejaz hopes she can restart swimming classes this season. “Also, I love dancing and used to participate in a lot of competitions and school functions. Now, I have to record a video of me dancing and send it to my teacher,” said Aiejaz with a small frown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/trapped-in-web-students-yearn-to-return-to-school/articleshow/81728504.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Lucknow||UP: ‘Special 16’ team of GRP reunites 123 missing kids with kin in 80 days||LUCKNOW: This Holi will be special for sisters Shikha (13), Radha (15) and Varsha (17), who spent 10 years at a government shelter home in Noida, and were finally reunited with their father and two elder siblings, courtesy ‘Special 16’ team of GRP. Further good news is that the trio is not alone, as the 16 employees from Agra and Jhansi divisions have tracked 123 missing children of 12 states in 80 days. In December 2020, GRP Agra and Jhansi heads, Md Mustaque and Ashish Tiwari, thought of tracing missing children of 24 districts under them. As many as 50 cops volunteered, but 16 were picked and divided into five teams, including two each for Agra and Jhansi divisions and one support team for communication channel and advisory role. Mustaque, a 2016 batch IPS officer, told TOI, “First, we gave basic training to cops about child rights, norms and how to collaborate with local child welfare committees. A 15-point standard operating procedure was also shared on how to trace, identity and rescue.” “First, we collected data of 231 missing children from 24 district crime record bureaus. Then we collected more information about the missing children from complainants. Our team found that 81 out of 231 children had already been reunited with their parents, but were still missing in records. In the second phase, our teams travelled to Delhi, Faridabad, Noida, Indore, Bhopal, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and other cities to trace children,” he said. Constable Sachin Kaushik of the team said, “In the case of three sisters, our team had gone to look for another kid, but found them. The eldest knew her father’s address in Jhansi, but he had sold the house and moved out. We collected information about him from the new owner. Their father couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw their pictures.” In 2011, the girls’ mother brought them to Noida after a quarrel with her husband. She went missing following which the landlord informed police. The team traced 51 children of UP, 29 of Bihar, 11 of Delhi, four of Rajasthan, seven of Madhya Pradesh, five each of West Bengal and Gujarat, six of Haryana, two of Jharkhand, one each of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The cops also tracked a five-year-old’s family by his caste and location. “The kid said he is Jatav and hails from Etmadpur, Agra. We found his aunt, who led us to his mother,” said GRP.

Around one-third of the use of oxygen for Covid-19 patients in the state are from Vadodara city and district.Oxygen is a critical requirement for Covid-19 treatment as the oxygen saturation goes down in many patients. They have to be given oxygen to ensure that they survive. In the first wave, the city was staring at oxygen shortage that was averted by timely intervention. To solve the issue in the biggest Covid-19 treatment facilities at the SSG Hospital and GMERS Hospital, liquid oxygen tanks were erected on a war footing. Data reveals that 2,650 persons were on oxygen support across the state on Friday, included 1,240 in Vadodara. On March 1, the state had 588 Covid-19 patients in the state needing oxygen and this included 197 from Vadodara. Out of 1,658MT (metric tonne) oxygen used in the state this month till Friday, 489.6MT was used in Vadodara.Sources said that the high requirement for oxygen could be due to higher hospitalisation in Vadodara. Large events held in the recent past, as well as polls, are believed to be major contributors apart from people lowering their guard in general.Officer on special duty for Covid-19 Vinod Rao said that there was sufficient oxygen supply to cater to the needs of Covid-19 patients. “Lot of oxygen meant for industrial use has been diverted to hospitals. We have local vendors too, who are taking care of our needs,” said Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/high-oxygen-consumption-cause-of-concern-in-vadodara/articleshow/81727405.cms||---
---||Mumbai||No extension for hosp if it doesn’t get fire NOC, OC in Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC has decided not to extend the nursing home licence of Bhandup’s Sunrise Hospital, which ends on March 31, unless its management submits an NOC from fire brigade and gets a permanent occupation certificate (OC). “They had applied for an extension, but we will not grant it unless they get NOCs from fire brigade and permanent OC from building proposal (BP) department. The nursing home licence ends on March 31, and they will have to shut down the hospital unless they comply with the requirements,” said additional municipal commissioner (health) Suresh Kakani. Officials said Sunrise Hospital management had applied for an extension for the nursing home in early March. Then municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi had approved a provisional OC to Sunrise Hospital, on the third floor of Bhandup’s Dreams Mall, where a major fire broke out on Thursday, in view of the exceptional circumstances created by Covid-19. The provisional OC was issued on May 6, 2020, while Pardeshi was shunted out on May 8. BJP MLA Mihir Kotecha said BMC was going to give it an extension if it was not for the fire. “They had over 70 Covid patients. There was no way they would have shut the hospital on March 31, If that was the case, they should have stopped admitting new patients long back. There is a shortage of beds so BMC must check compliances and allow hospitals to run,” Kotecha said. Provisional OC was given in the name of Privilege Healthcare to run as a Covid hospital due to the pandemic. It was only meant to treat health and frontline workers. Officials said Privilege Healthcare director Nikita Trehan requested BMC on April 25, 2020, and offered to provide the entire hospital as a facility with 250 beds. The hospital asked BMC to issue an OC so that the hospital could be started. “We asked for a fire brigade NOC and a permanent OC. As it was an emergency, we gave permission till March 31,” an official said.

The court observed that no leniency could be shown towards the respondent and he was sent to jail directly from court. The high court on September 11, 2018, while determining an application for mesne profit (damages or compensation recoverable from a person who has been in wrongful possession of immovable property), had directed the convict to pay and occupation charges at Rs 10,000 per month from the date of decree passed by the trial court, which is from October 10, 2014, to September 10, 2018, and thereafter arrears with effect from September 2018 to December 2018, by December 31, 2018. Lastly, the respondent was directed to ensure that he continued to pay use and occupation charges at the rate of Rs 10,000 per month by depositing the same in the registry of high court by 10th of every month till the disposal of the appeal. After the failure of respondent Lalit Kumar to deposit use and occupation charges, the petitioner had filed an instant contempt petition. “What is surprising is that the respondent, in spite of pendency of this petition, did not even care to deposit a single penny despite being repeatedly shown by this court as is evident from the order sheet(s),” observed Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan in the judgment decided on Thursday. It said that even despite undertaking, the respondent has failed to honour the same and had not paid a single penny towards the use and occupation charges as determined on September 11, 2018, or even as per the undertaking given in the open court by the respondent on December 11, 2019. Judgment said in such circumstances, the respondent was asked to show cause why he should be not punished and prosecuted for contempt and since there was no reasonable explanation offered by the respondent, the court convicted him and handed him a prison term.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-sentences-mandi-man-to-6-months-in-prison-for-contempt/articleshow/81728501.cms||---

The state government has recently built his memorial in Gorakhpur jail,” he said. The CM also inaugurated a 7D theatre on the zoo premises. He said that 151 wildlife had arrived at the zoo till Saturday, inlcuding Asiatic and Bengal tigers, and very soon, the number was expected to go up to 400. He also expressed the hope that “something new” would be seen at the zoo by the festival of Diwali.

A government higher secondary school teacher had tested Covid-19 positive on Friday, but Madurai district chief educational officer (CEO) R Swaminathan called it an isolated incident.“The teacher contracted the infection outside of school. He worked for only one day and went home immediately after having fever. Samples were collected from all students and staff and all have returned negative,” the CEO told TOI. He further assured that Covid-19 SOPs are being strictly enforced in all functional schools and hostelsl. Awareness was also being created through an online meeting with doctors on vaccination for those eligible.“There would have been at least some cause for worry if classes IX to XII were functional,” said the headmaster of a government higher secondary school. Some private schools are also alternating with online and offline classes .“It is a little concerning when teachers test positive. The children could easily become asymptomatic carriers. Vaccination for all teachers and Class XII students going to write the board exams is the need of the hour,” said S Latha, mother of a Class XII student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/schools-allay-fears-of-covid-19-spread-as-madurai-cases-rise/articleshow/81728969.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

---||Kolkata||BJP showcases ‘CM call tape’ to local leader||Nandigram: BJP on Saturday released a telephonic conversation claiming chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is contesting from Nandigram, had called the BJP’s Tamluk organisation district vice-president Pralay Pal, urging him return to Trinamool. Pal, who stays in Nandigram’s Birulia, claimed he had turned down the CM’s offer and will work for “Suvendu Adhikari’s win in Nandigram”. The alleged conversation triggered a bitter war of words between Trinamool and BJP. Responding to the audio tape, minister Subrata Mukherjee first demanded that it be brought out in public. “I would urge the media to frame their questions slightly differently. Where did this ready-made tape come from? When we speak to someone, do we record the conversation? There is something wrong with this. This appears to be planned meticulously. We demand a probe to unearth its origin,” he told reporters. “But I am proud that my leader is Mamata Banerjee. If a dedicated party worker leaves the party, what is wrong in calling them in the first place,” he said, adding, “Even Indira Gandhi and Priyaranjan Dasmunshi had called to persuade me.” BJP leader Shishir Bajoria, while playing the audio clip at a press meet, said: “If the CM, who is now the caretaker CM, couldn’t have entered Nandigram as she told BJP district vice-president Pralay Pal, she doesn’t deserve to be the CM. A high-profile person like her is begging for help from a BJP district leader. It leaves enough indications of what is going to happen on the result day.” BJP general secretary and Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya said: “Only a candidate who has accepted defeat can speak the way Mamata Banerjee has spoken.” BJP’s Bengal co-minder Amit Malviya, too, tweeted on this, claiming, “Pishi is definitely losing Nandigram and TMC Bengal.” In the tape, the voice being attributed to CM is heard saying, “You should help us win Nandigram. Look, I know you have some grievances, but that's due mostly to the Adhikaris who never allowed me to get into Nandigram or East Midnapore. I will take care of everything henceforth.” To which Pal admits he replied, “Didi, you called me, and I am honoured. But I can't betray the Adhikaris as they have stood by me through thick and thin.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-showcases-cm-call-tape-to-local-leader/articleshow/81728006.cms||Suman Mondal

---||Lucknow||Officers’ appraisal linked to revenue mop-up: Uttar Pradesh minister||LUCKNOW: Expressing his displeasure over the slow revenue recovery during the special one-time settlement (OTS) scheme in UPPCL for speedy recovery of pending bills, energy minister Shrikant Sharma warned senior officials of the corporation that their annual performance would be assessed on the basis of revenue recovery in their discoms. “It is unfortunate that when the OTS scheme is almost coming to an end on March 31, in most of the discoms the recovery has been around 20%, barring a few, and it is unacceptable,” the minister said. In a review meeting chaired by Sharma on Saturday, UPPCL authorities informed the members that baring Kanpur Electricity Supply Company (KESCO), the four other discoms had failed to register even 40% of the defaulters under the OTS scheme. KESCO recorded 57.4 % registration of consumers for OTS, while discoms like Purvanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PuVVNL) recorded 17%, the lowest among all. According to UPPCL, PVVNL managed to register 35% power bill defaulters, DVVNL 20% and MVVNL 17%. Under MVVNL, the Lucknow Electricity Supply Administration (LESA), there are close to 1.82 lakh power defaulters who owe Rs 172 crore to the discom, however only 30% have registered themselves for OTS. After going through the data, the minister expressed his displeasure over the discoms’ poor performance. “Officials need to promote OTS among the masses and motivate them to register themselves to get waiver on the interest levied on the power bill and clear all dues by March 31. The discom authorities should also readdress complaints of consumers with regard to discrepancies in bill and build confidence,” said the power minister. “Also, I warn that the major defaulters with over Rs 1 lakh dues must be tapped by the discom officials for their bill recovery. Since their number is less as compared to the minor defaulters of less than Rs 1 lakh, by fetching them under the OTS scheme by knocking their doors, UPPCL can get major funds,” the minister said. The energy minister had announced a special OTS scheme for the power consumers to get their surcharge 100% waived by depositing their pending arrears by March 15. The date was then extended to March 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/officers-appraisal-linked-to-revenue-mop-up-min/articleshow/81728975.cms||Arvind Chauhan

Bhopal has around 11,000 autorickshaws of which around 3000 are used for transporting goods. And on any given day, most of them are seen overloaded, violating the very basic transport rules. On Tuesday, 13 people were killed after an overloaded passenger auto-rickshaw collided with a bus in Gwalior. As per the rule, auto-rickshaws are given the maximum strength of auto-rickshaws to carry. “Strength to carry passengers depends on the model of the auto-rickshaw. We have allowed maximum 1+3 in passenger autos. For other models, the strength allowed is 1+2 passengers,” said Bhopal RTO Sanjay Tiwari. For goods auto, the rule says that they can’t carry any item which is more than the length of the autos. However, auto drivers hardly heeds to the rules and regulations. When asked, auto drivers replied that they do it on the demand of the passengers. “We request the passengers to not to sit more than the given limit. But, they do not listen,” says Guddu Lodhi, an auto driver. Passengers have their own justifications. “Due to hike in fuel prices, the auto fares too are high. Government should come forward and rationalise the charges,” said Rakesh Sharma, a passenger. Bhopal RTO Tiwari said that composition fee is charged from such drivers. “We regularly organise the inspections of the auto-rickshaws. After the Gwalior incident it has been intensified,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/no-lessons-learnt-from-gwalior-mishap-overloaded-autos-rule-bhopal-roads/articleshow/81728009.cms||Ramendra Singh

The change in schedule will affect Madurai as it stands to lose three services to Delhi, as the Singapore flights originate from there. Director of the airport, S Senthil Valavan said that they could not approve the timing request due to shortage of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) manpower. They have sought concerned authorities to review the requirement for the airport and allot additional manpower according to the present requirement.Recently, Madurai airport got additional strength to facilitate round-the-clock operation, but airlines did not come forward for night operation. Subsequently, the strength has been diverted, he said.As per the summer schedule, the flight will reach Madurai at 1.45pm and leave for Singapore at 10pm on Mondays. Although the schedule starts from March 29, the flight will start its operation as per the new schedule starting from April 5. The reduction in frequency has left traders and air transport enthusiasts fuming. Earlier, the same flight was given 11.15pm slot by extending the working hours of airport officials and CISF. Airport observers claimed that the manpower shortage issue is being cited for several years now. Although the Singapore flight faced the same issue when it was introduced in September 2017, the working hours was extended to facilitate flight movement, but enthusiasm was not shown this time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-singapore-services-hit-by-cisf-shortage-at-airport/articleshow/81728977.cms||V Devanathan

Lobo said that many artistes and organisers have been working on the floats and performances for over a month now and the announcement of the Shigmo parades being cancelled has come as a big disappointment for them. “In my constituency alone, there are two floats almost ready and more than 100 youngsters have been practising for the parade for over a month,” he said, adding, “I feel the Shigmo parades should be allowed at places like Panaji, Mapusa, Ponda and Margao.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-should-hold-smaller-parades-lobo/articleshow/81728970.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to police, K Kalaiselvi, 24, of K Pudhupatti near Uthamapalayam, was married to Kasiraja of Peraiyur in 2018 and they had a one-year-old son. The woman was in love with Silambarasan of Chinnamanur since her college days, but both of them married different people. In March 2020, Kalaiselvi had a quarrel with her husband and she left his home to live with her parents. There she had started seeing Silambarasan who was married and had three children. On September 9, 2020 Silambarasan sent his family away and invited Kalaiselvi to his house, where both of them picked up a quarrel. Silambarasan, who ran a mutton stall, asked one of his employees Rajesh, 18, to come there with a knife. Silambarasan allegedly murdered Kalaiselvi and her son and cut their bodies into pieces with the help of Rajesh and tied them up in a gunny bag. The bags were thrown into a pond on the Chinnamanur-Muthalapuram Road, police said. Kalaiselvi’s father filed a habeas corpus plea in the Madras high court. Uthamapalayam inspector Bastin Dhinakaran conducted an enquiry based on the orders of Theni SP Sai Charan Tejaswi. After tracking Silambarasan’s cell phone records, police took him and Rajesh for questioning. The duo confessed to the killing and the bags with bones were retrieved from the site and have been sent for forensic examination. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/two-held-for-murdering-woman-child-seven-months-ago/articleshow/81728973.cms||---

With over 3,000 cases in Mulund in March, a scramble for beds at private hospitals began. The fire at Sunrise Hospital at Bhandup’s Dreams Mall was the second at a Covid hospital in the belt in six months. In October last year, two patients died while shifting, after a fire broke out at Mulund’s Apex Hospital due to a short-circuit in the hospital’s generator. BMC then stopped Apex Hospital from admitting Covid patients. With BMC shutting down a Covid centre in Mithaghar school and one at Mulund octroi naka not taking off, there is a bed shortage, said BJP MLA Mihir Kotecha. In June last year, BMC converted a school in Mulund into a full-fledged Covid hospital, with ICU beds, ventilators and dialysis machines. Mithaghar school in Mulund (E) was converted into a Covid centre for asymptomatic patients initially but as patients increased, facilities were boosted. It was shut down as cases declined. The jumbo centre at Richardson & Cruddas in Mulund is functional, where BMC is admitting Covid patients and part of it is being used for vaccination. “We lost over 200 Covid beds between Sunrise and Apex hospitals,” Kotecha said. Assistant municipal commissioner (T ward) Kishore Gandhi said, “We have 60 beds and in a week, we will increase it to 275. ” Chaitanya Marpakwar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-restarts-mulund-centre-as-it-loses-2-hospitals-to-fire-in-mumbai/articleshow/81729323.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The 8-month-old French bulldog gulped the rubber toy while nibbling on it playfully. The toy duckling was lodged in the pup’s stomach and had to be extricated surgically. Currey Road resident Nishant Ramesh Solanki had bought a set of three ducklings for his pet, Max, to play with. The plastic toy, the size of a child’s fist, made squeaky sounds when compressed. Last week, Nishant’s mother Sarla saw the pup trying to gobble up the duckling.“Before I could whisk it away, Max gulped it,” said Sarla. The pup was quickly rushed to the vet’s. It was throwing up and pooping intermittently and refused to eat, said Dr Amol Yamgar, veterinary surgeon. A quick x-ray showed the toy lodged in the pup’s stomach. The risk factor was that puppies are highly sensitive to anaesthesia. “French bulldogs are even more sensitive,” said Dr Yamgar. The pup was immediately wheeled in for surgery. A team of veterinarians — Atul Patil, Nitin Lavte and Dr Neha Mumbarkar — assisted in the life-saving operation. “The accurate dose of low-risk anaesthesia had to be administered. During the surgery, supportive medicines had to be given to pre-empt cardiac arrest or any respiratory problem. Pain medicines were given to avoid the pup from going into shock. After a 2-hour surgery, the toy was fished out. Had the foreign object been left inside, the pup would not have survived for more than three days, said Dr Yamgar. “The toy would have choked him,”he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/puppy-gulps-toy-duckling-undergoes-life-saving-op-in-mumbai/articleshow/81728985.cms||Alex Fernandes
---||Goa||Holi marks beginning of Shigmo folk festival||Keri: The festival of Holi in Goa is celebrated as Shigmo, where prayers are offered to Mother Nature seeking a pleasant summer and, later, copious monsoon for a good harvest. Shigmo is observed through practices that differ in every village. But the practices mainly involve offering prayers through folk songs, seeking blessings for a pleasant summer so it can aid preparations for the rain-fed agricultural crops. The folk singers recite songs calling upon the water-laden clouds ‘Meghraja’. The folk music is played using percussion instruments, which put the folk artistes under trance and then villagers seek their blessings in this state for the prosperity and happiness. Only one tree is felled for worship and the trunk is erected in front of the temple of the village deity. “The festival of Shigmo is being celebrated over generations to obtain blessings of Mother Nature. As the monsoon is uncertain, we offer prayers to get good rainfall that will help increase the yield,” said folk artiste Ram Mhauskar, 89, from Nagargao, Sattari. The erected tree trunk is well decorated with mango leaves and flowers and it is believed this ritual helps boost the local soil fertility. In Goa, this trunk is known as the ‘Holi’. During Shigmo, various rituals and cultural activities are performed at the earmarked sacred place locally known as ‘maand’. The menfolk from forest dwelling tribals and other communities perform a variety of folk dances like Morulo, Talgadi, Goff and Tonya Mel to the tune of folk music and folk songs that reflect the socio-cultural heritage of the land. The folk songs like Jati, Sakarati that are recited by the artistes, describe the seasonal flora and express the gratitude to Mother Nature. In Goa, Dhakto Shigmo begins around five days before the full moon day of the lunar month of Phalgun, whereas Vhodlo Shigmo is mostly celebrated on the beginning of the full moon day and continues for five or more days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/holi-marks-beginning-of-shigmo-folk-festival/articleshow/81728979.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Kolkata||TMC hits back, cites Sisir-Mukul tape||Kolkata: An audio clip in which two senior leaders are reportedly discussing to move the election commission to allow any Bengal voter to be a poll agent anywhere in the state added to the bitter political battle between Trinamool Congress and BJP on Saturday. On March 18, the EC had amended its rules, allowing anyone within an assembly segment to be a poll agent within that specific seat. The earlier rule mandated that the poll agent had to be a voter of that booth. Kunal Ghosh, Trinamool Congress spokesman, who released the audio clip in media on Saturday afternoon, alleged the BJP leaders influenced EC to change the poll norm. Earlier, Trinamool leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay led a team of MPs to the CEO and submitted a memorandum, asking for immediate withdrawal of the EC’s revised poll agent norms. Their letter to the EC read: “It seems the law is being trampled by repeated acts of the EC. A local person might be knowing many of the electors personally and might be of assistance in preventing impersonation at election.” The change was made without giving any cogent reason, the letter said. Chief electoral officer (CEO) Aariz Aftab said the complaint has been sent to the EC in New Delhi. Bandyopadhyay said his party wanted immediate withdrawal of this notification for the rest of the phases. “Only a voter of the booth should be a polling agent,” he said. Senior minister Subrata Mukherjee said, “This decision was made by EC without discussing with all parties and helped only BJP because they do not have enough people to stand in as poll agents.” BJP leader Mukul Roy, reportedly among the leaders heard in the audio tape, claimed, “The allegations are bogus.” State BJP spokesperson Sisir Bajoria, the other leader reportedly in the tape, said, “It was my conversation and there is nothing wrong in that. The Representation of People’s Act, 1951, maintains that a candidate must be a voter of the same state. We requested that the same logic be followed in case of the polling agents. There is nothing wrong in that. The commission did not agree to our request and we accepted that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-hits-back-cites-sisir-mukul-tape/articleshow/81728011.cms||Rohit Khanna

A circular issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE) said that the results for classes III to VIII will be declared on March 31. “Students of classes III to VIII promoted to the next higher class for the academic session 2021-22 will not come to school physically in view of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said the circular, adding that the common annual school examination for the students of classes IX and XI for 2020-21 will start on May 3 as per the schedule. Teaching and learning activities for the academic session 2021-22 for the students of the government and government-aided schools shall commence from the first week of April. “A plan of action has been prepared for the students of classes VI to IX through a combination of strategies using digital devices and support of parents and school management committees to minimise students’ academic loss,” the directorate further said. For parents who are not in WhatsApp groups, the class teacher concerned is required to make a phone call to them and invite them to school at a mutually convenient time and date to collect the worksheets. DoE has instructed that interactions with parents will be conducted in school following the social distancing protocols and not more than five parents will be called at any given time. “The class teacher should give a print out of the worksheets for the entire week to the parents and explain what needs to be done. When the child completes the assignment in their note book, any plain sheet or an audio/video message, the parents should assist the child to take a picture of the sheet or the audio/video message and send it back to their class teacher.

---||Nagpur||MVA has no mechanism for damage control: Raut||Mumbai: The weekly column in Saamna by Sena neta Sanjay Raut raising serious doubt about the functioning of the state government and calling state home minister Anil Deshmukh a minister by accident may create a chink in the so-far-united MVA government’s armour and make CM Udhav Thackeray looking for excuses to save his government from further embarrassment. Raut, also the executive editor of the party mouthpiece, raised a few loopholes in the state governance saying the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government does not have any mechanism for “damage control”. He said that no one came forward from the government side to face the allegations made by former commissioner of Mumbai police Parambir Singh who in his letter to the chief minister levelled allegations against the state home minister accusing him of asking API Sachin Waze to collect Rs100 crore. Raut further said in his column ‘Rokhthok’ that the incidents, happened in the last few months, raised questions on the “character” of Maharashtra and called Deshmukh a home minister by accident as NCP netas Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse-Patil refused to accept the responsibility. “The home portfolio is prestigious. The home minister should not be working in the company of suspects. He should speak the least, only if necessary once a while and keep a distance from the media. The man heading the police department is not there just to receive a salute, but is meant to offer strong leadership. How can we forget that such toughness comes from honesty?” Raut said. The Sena MP also sought an inquiry into “unlimited rights given to Sachin Waze”, an assistant police inspector. “If Waze was extorting money while sitting in the Police Commissionerate, then why was the home minister not aware of it? An extortionist API was defended initially in the state legislature but no one was ready to respond to Parambir’s allegations. This was terrible,” Raut said. Last week after Singh made allegations on Deshmukh, he was transferred amid a probe of explosives found near Mukesh Ambani’s residence. Singh appointed as director-general Home Guard, considered to be a punishment posting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mva-has-no-mechanism-for-damage-control-raut/articleshow/81737626.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

"I've had the great privilege of administering justice under that code," Bobde said at the inauguration of a new high court building at Porvorim. "It applies in marriage and succession, governing all Goans irrespective of religious affiliation. I have heard a lot of academics talk about the uniform civil code. I would request all those intellectuals to simply come here and watch the administration of justice to know what it turns out to be," he said. Bobde, who often sat in Goa during his tenure as a Bombay HC judge, said that something unique to this bench is the variety of cases. "In India, if there's any bench which gives you the variety of experiences and challenges as the Supreme Court, it is only the Constitution bench at Goa. When you sit on a Constitution bench in Goa, You can expect to hear a land acquisition case, a Section 302 murder appeal, a public interest litigation, a question under administrative law, income tax, sales tax and excise law." Talking about Goa's Liberation, he said although Goa was liberated later than the rest of the country, the most distinct thing about it was that it was "completely bloodless". "No shots were fired, no corpses carried away. When Liberation took place, a few incidents did occur, but basically it was not a conflict between the two armies, which is very different from Liberati-on in other places like Hyderabad," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cji-bobde-hails-goas-uniform-civil-code/articleshow/81730205.cms||Lisa Monteiro

The flat buyers had booked the properties in 2011 and 2012 in “RISE” project in Sector-37C in Gurugram, promoted by Ramprastha Promoters and Developers and Blue Bell Protech. The promoters had promised to hand over the flats by September 2015 as per the agreement signed with the buyers. Disposing of the five consumer complaints, which were filed in 2016, presiding member of NCDRC Justice Deepa Sharma ordered full repayment with interest to the buyers and also imposed litigation cost of Rs 25,000 in each case. The promoters have been directed to make the full payment in four weeks. There was no response from builders. Justice Sharma also turned down the arguments of the builders that the project got delayed due to the High Court of Punjab and Haryana order putting a complete ban on the use of underground water for construction and that they were allowed only to use recycled water for construction. They had claimed that these circumstances were beyond their control and hence amounted to ‘force majeure’. In her order, the NCDRC member said she had gone through the court order and the court had not put a complete ban on construction but had only put restrictions on use of underground water. “Nothing has stopped the opposite parties from procuring water by some other methods to complete construction. This argument of the learned counsel has no merit and the delay in completion of the project cannot be contributed to the order of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana and it is not a reason for delay which was beyond the control of the opposite party,” the order said. She also ruled that only a four months’ extension was permitted and hence, the promoters were bound under the said agreement to hand over the possession of the unit by September 2015, extendable by four months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/two-builders-told-to-fully-refund-5-flat-buyers/articleshow/81730467.cms||Dipak K Dash

She also ruled that only a four months’ extension was permitted and hence, the promoters were bound under the said agreement to hand over the possession of the unit by September 2015, extendable by four months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/two-builders-told-to-fully-refund-5-flat-buyers/articleshow/81728514.cms||Dipak K Dash

A team consisting of Lieutenant S Rajagopal, R Praiya from Mannar Thirumalai Naicker College and student Thavasi, have been on the lookout for ancient structures and inscriptions in the region. They stumbled upon the inscription at Papamadai in Avaniapuram, a few weeks ago. There were twin stone pillars, which were 10 feet high and one-and-a-half feet in breadth. The two inscriptions were found on one of the pillars, on two different sides. The first inscription had 19 lines, inscribed on it and the first three lines were in Telugu, a devotional song. According to the inscription which was deciphered by retired archaeologist C Santhalingan, it is one of gratitude to the sixth king of the Madurai Nayak dynasty, Veerappa Nayaka Ayan, for constructing the sluice which will help local irrigation activities. The second inscription is found engraved at the eastern side of the same pillar. Words at the beginning of the sentence have been erased, because it was exposed to the air and erosion.

No gathering will be allowed inside the Covid-19 containment zones. “All the guests will be subjected to strict observance, especially for face masks, maintaining social distancing, provision for thermal scanning and use of hand wash or sanitiser,” stated a DDMA order on Saturday.

It had allowed up to 200 people in banquet halls or closed spaces, while in the open spaces or grounds, the permissible limit depended on the size of the venue. After reviewing the existing Covid situation in Delhi, DDMA decided to curb the number of guests.

---||Goa||Hotel registration fees hiked asnew tourist trade rules get notified||Panaji: The government has notified the rules drafted under the amended Goa, Daman and Diu Registration of Tourist Trade Act, 1982. The law, which was amended last year, has hiked fees of different tourist trades and also brought more tourism trades under its ambit. The notification paves way for the implementation of reforms that could not be implemented earlier without the backing of the law. Hotel registration and renewal fees, depending on its category, have increased after a long time. A new ‘D’ category of accommodation has been added. This segment was earlier left out. Other accommodations, including bed and breakfast are part of the category. The fees charged for registration of other accommodations have been fixed at Rs 4,000, while homestay and bed and breakfast establishments will have to pay Rs 1,000 as annual fee. Trade body Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) has been demanding over the past four-five years that the tourism department should crackdown on unaccounted accommodations as they pose a direct threat to those who are doing business legitimately. The inventory of unaccounted rooms has multiplied over the years in the absence of checks. A hotelier said that they will wait and watch to see what action will be taken against those renting rooms to tourists without registration. “Now there is nothing to stop the department from going after people doing business illegally,” he said. An important rule that comes into effect with the notification pertains to the online service provider. Section 19 makes it mandatory for online service providers to register with the tourism department. The validity of the certificate will be initially for a period of one year and thereafter the certificate may be renewed for a period not extending five years. Registration and annual fees for online travel aggregator — providing travel and accommodation booking — has been fixed at Rs 2 lakh, while an online travel aggregator — offering accommodation booking — will have to pay Rs 1 lakh, as also an online travel aggregator providing travel booking. The rules mandate that hotels that are not registered with the prescribed authority shall not be listed or displayed by the online service provider. This rule also applies to a travel agent not listed with the tourism department In case a competent authority finds that any hotel or a travel agent that has not been registered, but is listed by an online service provider, it is empowered to issue an order directing the online provider to delete the name of a hotel or travel agent from its website.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hotel-registration-fees-hiked-asnew-tourist-trade-rules-get-notified/articleshow/81728987.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Covid plays spoilsport with Indian Derby race, brings it to a slow trot||Mumbai: The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted almost all aspect of the Indian Derby, the country’s most sought-after horse race, but it has really hurt thousands of Mumbaikars by preventing them from their annual presence at the Mahalaxmi Racecourse and be a part of top class fashion, food and entertainment extravaganza on Sunday.  With Covid-19 restrictions imposed by the Maharashtra government, only 600 people are allowed at the races. “Among the large number of those 600 people will be trainers, jockeys, horse handlers and their owners. So, very few might get tickets for the public enclosure,” said RWITC chairman Zavaray Poonawalla. “Am extremely disappointed,” said Dipti Kataria, a 24-year-old Peddar Road resident, one of the 20,000-odd Mumbaikars who throng the Mahalaxmi Racecourse every year to witness the Derby. “Like every year, me and my friends had bought new dresses for the occasion, but now we can’t attend,” she said. The racing enthusiast, however, can watch the live streaming on 1 Play Sport’s Facebook and YouTube handles from 4pm onwards for free. The restrictions have ensured the festivities will be subdued on the Derby day at racecourse. “But we will ensure a grand viewing experience for people watching it online,” said Gurpreet Singh, head of marketing, United Breweries Limited which has been sponsoring this mega race for over three decades. The prize money has taken a massive cut. It will be just Rs 1.5 crore, a far cry from nearly Rs 3 crore last year. Bangalore challenger Lagarde is likely to be installed as favourite for the mega race and is expected to get a tough challenge from Immortality and Forest Flame.  Another aspect that will be missing is presence of top-class international riding talent. The quarantine protocol has prevented top foreign jockeys from coming to Mumbai. “I wanted to bring English rider David Allan but he refused saying if I have to stay in quarantine for two weeks I may become unfit to ride,” informed S Padmanabhan, one of the top trainers in the country today.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-plays-spoilsport-with-indian-derby-race-brings-it-to-a-slow-trot/articleshow/81728992.cms||Shailendra Awasthi

If family objects, we can’t do it. We have received no such requests yet,” a health official said replying to a query that people above sixty fearing death or any other complications may avoid vaccination. The health officer said lakhs of people who are sixty plus have been vaccinated and nothing has happened to them. “To say anything concretely, we need to examine how many received the vaccines and the number of deaths reported thereafter,” he said. So, it cannot be simply inferred in the case of the death of a 70 or 80-year-old man, that he died because of the vaccine, he said. Goa has administered over 1 lakh doses and health services are set to start vaccinating 3 lakh population above 45 from April 1. The health services have been lagging in their target in inoculating senior citizens. It had set a target of vaccinating 1.5 lakh 60 plus people by the end of April. “We might not be able to achieve that target by April-end but with a new phase of vaccination opening from April 1 for 45 plus adults with or without comorbidities, we are hopeful that more people will come forward to get vaccine shots,” the health officer said. The health department will start vaccinating 3 lakh population in the 45+ age group from April 1||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/autopsy-ofcovid-ve-if-family-desires/articleshow/81728988.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Timely renewal of assets like rails is a major activity to ascertain asset reliability,” said engineering department officials. “To ensure the safety and smooth operation of train, the division has completed its highest ever target of TRR 212km, which is a big achievement,” said divisional railway manager (DRM) Richa Khare. “This resulted in a reduction of 16% alumino thermit welds joints population and 11% flush butt (FB) welds joints from the system which enhances the safety of railways manifolds. This also helped in reducing the rail fracture and weld failure instances by 67% in comparison to last year,” said Pawan Patil, senior divisional engineer (coordination), Central Railway. “This could be possible as we received continuous support from Ashwini Saxena, principal chief engineer (PCE), for giving required rails to the division from Bhilai Steel Plant,” said Patil. “Even during Covid-19 pandemic period, the target achieved by the engineering department and entire team of engineers is laudable. The TRR works are tough and laborious and need proper planning to execute so that no train movement gets affected,” said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/central-railway-achieves-212km-rails-renewal-despite-covid-19/articleshow/81727378.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Ranger whose father died on duty receives international ranger award||DEHRADUN: Mahinder Giri, a range officer who has been deployed at Motichur range of Rajaji Tiger Reserve (RTR) for the past few years, has become the only ranger from Asia to win the prestigious International Ranger Award. The award has been announced for 10 professionals across the globe by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA), “based on their contribution towards conservation”. According to Giri’s seniors, he won the award for his efforts in curbing human-wildlife conflict in and around Rajaji and his role in the ongoing tiger translocation exercise from Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) to RTR. A total of 113 nominations of 630 forest staffers from 43 different countries were submitted, and Giri emerged as the only winner from Asia. Other winners were from Latin America, Africa and Eastern Europe. All the winners will receive a uniform patch and their employing organisations will receive US $10,000 (Rs 7,26,150) as prize money, which can be used to “support the winner and their team to conduct their work”. “This can include purchasing essential supplies or equipment, providing training, providing insurance, supporting the family of a deceased ranger, or other ranger welfare activities” said a communique released by World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The award was created in 2020 by IUCN and WCPA in collaboration with International Ranger Federation, Global Wildlife Conservation, and Conservation Allies. A resident of Bahadarabad village, Haridwar, Giri became an employee of the forest department in his early twenties. In 1996, his father, Rameshwar Dayal Giri, a forest guard at Motichur range, was trampled to death by an elephant while on duty. The next year, Giri, a high school pass out, got the job on compensatory grounds. Now in his early 50s, around the same age that his father died, Giri said he is overjoyed to receive international recognition. “By conserving the forests, we are actually saving human lives, not just animals or trees. That’s why I have dedicated my life to the cause of conservation," he said. In 2017, Giri became the first person to single-handedly man the newly-formed tiger monitoring unit of western Rajaji. The unit now employs 23 workers who look after the seven ranges of western Rajaji – Kansro, Ramgarh, Dhaulkhand, Beriwada and Haridwar forest ranges. JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden, Uttarakhand forest department, said that Giri was always keen on minimising human-wildlife conflict by educating the stakeholders. “He would go the extra mile to counsel villagers on anti-poaching measures, how to interpret pug marks etc. He would also conduct workshops for contractual workers,” Suhag said. The tiger translocation exercise from CTR to RTR reached fruition after eight years’ efforts and Giri played a key role in the success, said Suhag. “Giri personally scans footage of 285 cameras placed across RTR on a regular basis. He monitors the movement of tigers and ensures their safety from anti-forest elements,” Suhag said. For his efforts, Giri has in the past received multiple appreciation certificates and state-level recognitions as well, the chief wildlife warden said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rajaji-ranger-whose-father-died-on-duty-as-forest-guard-becomes-only-recipient-from-asia-of-international-ranger-award/articleshow/81728046.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Pune||State unlikely to change existing RR rates on April 1||Pune: The state government is unlikely to change the existing ready reckoner rates on April 1 this year.A source in the state government said there was a discussion to keep the rates unchanged as of now, taking into count the present Covid-19 pandemic crisis and the overall sentiment of the real estate market. An official communication from the government on maintaining the status quo on ready reckoner (RR) rates was expected next week, the source said.“The real estate market has started to get buoyant now. It is unlikely that the government would want to disturb it,” said the source.A senior state government official in the know of developments said the registration department was working on preparing the RR rates after due consultation and assessing the rates area-wise. But the government was unlikely to make any changes now, he added.The RR rates for residential and commercial properties based on their location are announced on April 1 ever year. In 2020, the revised rates were announced in September because of the Covid-19 pandemic.On an average, the RR rates were increased by 1.74% last year. The highest average increase in RR rate — 3.91% — was registered in Pune district. In Mumbai, the average upward revision was 0.6%.Many developers have been demanding downward revision of RR rates for quite some time now. They claimed that the rates, especially in cities like Pune, were extremely high. Some developers had met the revenue minister demanding that the state government should not increase the RR rate this April because it was revised in September last year.Before September 2020, the RR rates were last revised in 2017 because the earlier government had decided to keep them unchanged thereafter. Between 2010 and 2015, the average hike in RR rates was in the range of 10-25%. After several follow-ups, the government had reduced the hike in rates.Haze on stamp duty waiver extensionThere is no clarity on the developers’ demand to continue with the stamp duty waiver of 2% till the end of this year. The state government had last year announced a 3% waiver on stamp duty from September to December and a 2% waiver from January to March in 2021 to boost the realty sector during the pandemic.Sources said the waiver was unlikely to be extended because of the government’s revenue crunch.Registrars’ offices to remain open tomorrowAll the 48 sub-registrar’s offices in Pune rural (21) and Pune city (27) would remain open on Monday to enable citizens register their documents. State inspector-general of registration and stamps Shravan Hardikar said local authorities — the collector and the joint district registrar — would decide on the days to keep the offices open to ensure that there is no rush.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-unlikely-to-change-existing-rr-rates-on-april-1/articleshow/81728051.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Trinamool workers later staged agitation at the Nandigram police station demanding action. Boyal gram panchayat, where the fresh incident took place, is being repeatedly plagued by violence. A Trinamool Youth Congress leader, his brother and driver were assaulted here several days back. Three days back, MP Abhishek Banerjee had held a rally in this belt. The fresh attack on its party workers prompted Trinamool to stage an agitation in front of Nandigram police station with the demand of immediate arrest of the culprits. Trinamool leader Sk Sufiyan — the CM’s election agent — said: “Sensing a possible defeat, BJP has been making trouble. We know how to handle them.” Trinamool booth president Rabin Mondal was among those injured. The CM is expected to interact with people in the Reyapara Shib Mandir Dol Utsav and address four rallies in Nandigram on Monday and Tuesday. Nandigram’s BJP candidate Suvendu Adhikari, who faced a series of agitations in Nandigram, made some comments in Daudpur in face of repeated barbs of betraying his aides. “I am a staunch Hindu. I don't leave my home without offering puja. I stood strong with these villagers during the lockdown. I supplied them food packets. They did not have any problem accepting them. They had no problem when the free ration was sent to them by the Modi government. But I felt strange when I had to enter these areas with central force. If you don't want to vote for me, it is fine. But why do you stage agitations against me? In democracy, people can express their opinion through ballots,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nandigram-erupts-ahead-of-elections/articleshow/81728054.cms||Suman Mondal
---||Goa||Goa’s UCC is what Constitution’s framers envisaged for India: Bobde||PANAJI: Chief justice of India S A Bobde on Saturday hailed Goa’s uniform civil code, and said the state already has what the framers of the Constitution envisaged for the whole of India. “I’ve had the great privilege of administering justice under that code,” he said, speaking at the inauguration of a new high court building in Porvorim. “It applies in marriage and succession, governing all Goans irrespective of religious affiliation. I have heard a lot of academics talk about the uniform civil code. I would request all those intellectuals to simply come here and watch the administration of justice to know what it turns out to be.” Bobde, who often sat in Goa during his tenure as a Bombay HC judge, said that something unique to this bench is the variety of cases. “In India, if there’s any bench which gives you the variety of experiences and challenges as the Supreme Court, it is only the Constitution bench at Goa. When you sit on a Constitution bench in Goa, you can expect to hear a land acquisition case, a Section 302 murder appeal, a public interest litigation, a question under administrative law, income tax, sales tax, excise law.” Talking about Goa’s Liberation, he said that although Goa was liberated later than the rest of the country, the most distinct thing about it was that it was “completely bloodless”. “No shots were fired, no corpses carried away. When Liberation took place, a few incidents did occur, but basically it was not a conflict between the two armies, which is very different from Liberation in other places like Hyderabad,” he said, minutes after Union minister for law and justice Ravi Shankar Prasad said he was baffled by why Goa was liberated so much later than the rest of India. Prasad said the country had not heard of the freedom fighters of the Goa Liberation movement, and requested chief minister Pramod Sawant to make their contribution and valour known to the rest of India. “When India’s Independence is now close to 75 years (old), it’s time to have an honest appraisal to why Goa’s Liberation took so long. We have the best relations with Portugal, and we wish them well... That relationship will be there and should continue, but there has to be an honest appraisal. I thought I must flag that concern today and salute all the freedom fighters of the Goa movement,” Prasad said. Bobde said that he is the only judge or one of the few judges who sat so often in Goa, with around eight visiting assignments here, and was happy to hear people remark that he was a ‘Goa judge’. He said he admired Goa’s culture, natural habitat, music and even football. “For me, the high court building meant the Lyceum building, which we are going to leave behind,” he said. “Now on, it will mean something else and I will have no experience of having been a judge here.” Bobde also said he is proud to see the Goa bench extend itself to the new building. “Just like the design and structure of a hospital has profound consequences for everything from the doctor-patient relationship to the way a society understands pain, death and public health, the space in which justice is administered profoundly affects how it is administered,” he said. The new two-storied building, which spread across 3 hectares on the banks of the River Mandovi, is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities. Built at a cost of approximately Rs 175 crore, the new building has seven court halls, a creche, user-friendly washrooms, senior citizen rooms, audio visual signage, braille and tactile signs, and facilities for lawyers including meetings rooms and bar rooms. The high court is expected to begin functioning from the new building in June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-ucc-is-what-constitutions-framers-envisaged-for-india-bobde/articleshow/81728999.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Kochi||Periya still grieves for Sarathlal and Kripesh||Periya: On National Highway 66 near the northern tip of Kerala, we take a turn from Periya junction in the Mavunkal-Kasaragod stretch and travel towards Kalliyot. The actual homes of Sarathlal and Kripesh -- the two Youth Congress activists waylaid and hacked to death allegedly by CPM goons on February 17, 2019 -- is in Kalliyot, but it is the name Periya that shocked the national consciousness and became a symbol of the senseless political violence habitually indulged in by CPM cadres to silence their rivals. Every electric post that we encounter on the road to Kalliyot has black-and-white graffiti of the two Youth Congress men, bound together in death as they were in life, their images etched on a saffron-white-green background. There are other visible signs too -- those of the “emotional outburst” and reaction of Congress activists: a bus shelter built by CPM lies half demolished. A man-sized sickle, hammer and star -- the CPM symbol -- erected on the roadside has been smashed to pieces. A flagpole on the top of the barren and rocky land through which the road traverses has only the tri-colour flag of the Congress fluttering on it, very unusual in interior Kasaragod. At the sleepy Kalliyot junction, from where we take a right turn towards the homes of the two slain men, we are welcomed by huge cut-outs of Sarathlal and Kripesh. “We have never been able to forget these two boys. Ever since the gory incident, they have been etched deep in the minds of the people here,” says Narayanan, as he tries to 'aesthetically' arrange his wares in the local corner store. After a minor deviation near Kalliyot Devi temple, we reach the memorial of the two young men. Their relatives, friends and Congress activists have built a memorial for the two friends on land provided free of cost by a close kin over the very same spot where they were cremated. Two traditional chendas welcome the visitors at the main entry to the two marble tombs -- the percussion instruments a reminder of the training they used to impart to 60-plus students as part of Vadya Kala Sangam. “In December 2019, when the temple hosted the biggest festival in several decades, there were lakhs of people from various parts of Malabar. They all paid a visit to the memorial and offered flowers. Interestingly, even some CPM leaders, whose names I do not want to disclose, had paid a visit to this memorial covertly,” says Baburaj, Periya block panchayat member and a relative of Sarathlal. Traditionally Kalliyot ward has been with the Congress, but after the incident, the CPM has been completely on the defensive across the entire assembly constituency. “Their local leaders even admitted that they would not visit a house in the area seeking votes, and wherever they visited, they had to face the ire of the women in these houses,” Baburaj adds. The result was evident in the Lok Sabha elections of 2019 when the CPM lost the seat after 30 years. The Congress wave did not end there. In the local body elections, the Pullur-Periya grama panchayat went to the UDF, with the Congress winning Kalliyott ward in a walkover. “The Periya double murder was never a local issue. It is still fresh in the minds of people, especially after the CBI probe and the CBI visiting the place, including the area committee office of the CPM,” says Kasaragod MP and Congress leader Rajmohan Unnithan. So there would definitely be a reflection of the incident in this assembly elections, not only in Uduma constituency but in all assembly constituencies of Kasaragod, he claims. As we sat chatting at the memorial, a jeep comes and stops nearby. A young man resembling Sarathlal gets down and walks towards us, smiling. Baburaj introduces him to us as Roopesh, who is the first cousin of Sarathlal. On the way to the house of Sarathlal, which is half-a-km from the memorial, Roopesh talks about that horrible night when his cousin was slaughtered by a group of CPM men. At the modest residence of Sarathlal, we choose to sit in the courtyard, on plastic chairs under a roof made of dried coconut leaves; the floor is plastered with cow-dung. “The CPM has stooped to such a level that they will go to any extent to annihilate anyone who exhibits any kind of leadership skills or are liked by the public, but are not in their control,” says Sarathlal’s father Satyanarayan. Sarathlal’s younger sister Amritha, who was the first to spot her brother’s motorcycle lying by the roadside on that fateful day, serves us black tea quickly -- she is getting ready to go for family meetings in Kannur organised by the UDF. Amritha, along with Kripesh’s younger sister Krishna Priya, will be attending several such meetings of the UDF. “I will campaign if the Congress party asks me to. My son was the only hope of my life, which has been destroyed by the CPM. I am living with the hope of providing justice to my son,” says Satyanarayan. Most UDF candidates visit the memorial either when they begin their campaign or during the campaign. Last Saturday, UDF candidate in Trikaripur visited the memorial, where he also announced a decision to sponsor two students, including the sister of Sarathlal, who wish to pursue civil services as their career. The local UDF candidate Balakrishnan Periya does not even remind voters about the murders. People don't forget such things in a hurry. The government’s actions are equally responsible for the incident remaining fresh in the minds of even neutral voters. “More than the CPM, it was the government that chose to defend the murders by resisting the move to transfer the case to the CBI, spending lakhs of rupees from the public exchequer. The government’s actions were similar to how the Church tried to defend the culprits of Sister Abhaya murder case,” says noted novelist,and a resident of Trikaripur, C V Balakrishnan. The CPM leadership in the district is rattled but tries to put on a brave face. “Kalliyot ward has traditionally been with the Congress... in the last Lok Sabha elections, Kasargod was only one among 19 constituencies lost by LDF. There are many factors, and the Periya incident alone cannot be cited as a reason for that,” says CPM Kasaragod district secretary M V Balakrishnan. On May 2, when the results are out, it will reveal to what extent ordinary voters will tolerate the politics of murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/periya-still-grieves-for-sarathlal-and-kripesh/articleshow/81728535.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Pune||Domestic help hopes to emerge stronger after battling job loss||PUNE: Lanka Kasbe lost her job as a domestic help after her employer received pink slip at the height of Covid-19 pandemic last year. Many domestic helps lost their jobs after the lockdown was clamped last year and many housing societies barred them from reporting for work. While some continued to pay salaries to their domestic helps to help them survive the pandemic, several people could not afford do so owing to job loss or salary cuts. "I used to work for a couple, looking after their five-year-old child and doing some household work for them as well. I was paid Rs15,000 per month, but when the lockdown began I was told not to come and was fired a month later. My husband is physically challenged. Moreover, my son was also slated to appear for his higher secondary certificate (Class XII) board exam last year," Kasbe said. In despair, she called up her previous employers. "Some of them helped me with ration, such as rice, dal, wheat, sugar and so on. Some of them told me to come to their society gate and helped me with money. I am not educated and don’t even have a bank account. I had to pawn all my jewellery to pay the school fees of my son and medical bills of my husband and run the house. We, somehow, managed to scrape though last year." Things got a little better for her after the lockdown was lifted. "Some of my previous employers gave me jobs. I am working in four houses now, doing dishes, sweeping, swabbing or cooking. Currently, I earn around Rs10,000, much less than what I used to earn before but enough to take care of my family’s basic needs. My son passed Class XII and got a job at a hypermarket earlier this year. He has just begun contributing towards household expenses too, but I want him to save money for further studies," she added. Her determination to live through hard times has stood her in good stead. Now Kasbe hopes that things would continue to improve further despite the rise in the number of Covid cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/domestic-help-hopes-to-emerge-stronger-after-battling-job-loss/articleshow/81728068.cms||---

AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi named Trinamool-turned AIMIM’s Noore Mehbub Alam as the candidate for the Sagardighi seat and announced that the party is going to field a candidate from Jalangi. According to AIMIM sources, the party has plans to field 13 candidates in 22 seats in the district with an eye on the minority votes that was shared mainly between the Congress and the Trinamool. “I have decided the candidates for Sagardighi and Jalangi. Other names will be announced in a day or two,” the AIMIM chief said after holding a meeting at the Sagardighi High School grounds on Saturday. The Murshidabad assembly seats are going to polls in two phases on March 10 and March 26. The AIMIM chief is not bothered about chief minister Mamata Banerjee calling him a “gaddar”. Owaisi is neither troubled with the Congress and CPM’s putting the “BJP-B team” tag on him. “I would have been happy if these parties had worked for the upliftment of the community instead of using them as vote banks,” the AIMIM chief said. While targeting BJP, Owaisi said: “BJP cannot tolerate me or my party as I openly criticized the BJP’s role for damaging the country’s secular fabric. The minority community is under threat of the BJP’s Hindutva policy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sagardighi-gets-aimim-candidate/articleshow/81728060.cms||Sukumar Mahato

---||Bhopal||Holi bash banned, shops saddled with goods; biz shrinks by 80%||Bhopal: Strict Covid curbs imposed by the government amid rising Covid-19 cases has played a spoilsport for Holi festival. It has hit around 80% market business this year. Shopkeepers said that in the absence of the customers it was not possible for them to run the business. “Where are the customers? There was no logic of installing the shop for Holi products. The situation is the same in every market of the state capital,” said Neeraj Shastri, a shopkeeper in New Market. Another shopkeeper said that for Holi shopping, customers mostly come a day before the festival. “This year, there is a lockdown in Bhopal on Sunday. In such a situation, most of the customers kept themselves away from the market,” said another shopkeeper in Indrapuri. Even the customers found it better to not buy Holi products this year. “The pandemic is far from over. I can’t put my family at risk. This is a situation where I would think everyone should celebrate a symbolic holi,” said Anand Yadav, a resident of Arera Colony. Major setback was for the shopkeepers who had stocked Holi products in large quantities. “I was under the impression that the situation would be better by March. As such, I filled my shop with a lot of Holi products. But now, I am saddled with the products. Customers have not turned up,” said Anil Sharma, a shopkeeper. The shopkeepers are now worried about how to pay back the credit. “Several people were not in favour of installing a shop for Holi this year. I was thinking something else as if they don't install their shop I will get the benefit. However, the entire approach turned wrong after the government imposed lockdown," said Nikhil Sahu, a shopkeeper. Mass celebrations during Holi are already banned in Bhopal where coronavirus infection cases are on the rise. Earlier, traders faced loss of business due to lockdown and Covid-19 restrictions during festivals. Already in loss, the traders are not in position to bear further losses due the fresh restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/holi-bash-banned-shops-saddled-with-goods-biz-shrinks-by-80/articleshow/81728076.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: 14 villages in Ridge may become reserved forest||NEW DELHI: The forest department has sent a list of 14 villages situated in Southern Ridge to the revenue department for vetting them for declaring these villages as reserved forest. The notification under Section 20 (declaration of reserved forest) of Indian Forest Act of 19 villages has been pending since 1994 as the revenue and forest department’s land records and map didn’t match and also, due to settlement of rights. Once notified, the area will become protected land and steps will be taken for improving their green cover and wildlife habitat. Deputy conservator of forests (South) Amit Anand said, “The list of villages, which are encroachment-free and litigation-free, has been sent to the revenue department for vetting. After we receive the clearance, we will forward the file of these villages to the government of India for declaring them as reserved forest.” The reserved forest tag will give legal sanctity to the areas. “We will make preparation for their better management and improving the biodiversity,” said Vipul Pandey, deputy conservator of forests (protection and monitoring). The list of 14 villages includes Asola, Rajpur Khurd, Chattarpur, Sahoorpur, Satbari, Saidulajaib, Bhati, Nebsarai, Maidangarhi, Ayanagar, Dera Mandi, Jaunapur, Devli and Tughlaqabad. The work of draft notification of remaining five villages—Pul Pehladpur, Rajokri, Rangpuri, Ghitorni and Mahipalpuri— is under way. A forest official said these 19 villages under Southern Ridge were notified under Section 4 of Indian Forest Act in 1994 but the process of final notification under Section 20 of the act has been pending for over two decades. The demarcation of these villages has been completed while illegal squatters are being removed. Construction of boundary walls and fencing are under way for the protection of forest land. According to the minutes of a recent meeting of Ridge Management Board, in Southern Ridge, an area of total 40.8 hectares has been made encroachment-free while 314 hectares area is left. “Major challenge in encroachment removal is in slum areas of South Delhi, which may take considerable time, as it is linked with rehabilitation of slum dwellers.” Even the National Green Tribunal in January this year had ordered that for the areas, which are not encroached and have already been demarcated and handed over to the forest department, the final notification under Section 20 of the Forest Act should be issued forthwith.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/14-villages-in-ridge-may-become-reserved-forest/articleshow/81728569.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Mumbai||Thappad strikes right notes, Irrfan gets emotional salute||Surely, the famous pair of chalice-like eyes—that shut permanently last year —must have crinkled with quiet pride from the beyond. Twice. At the 66th Vimal Elaichi Filmfare Awards 2021 on Saturday, the late Irrfan not only won the best actor (male) for portraying a befuddled small-town father in his swansong ‘Angrezi Medium’ but also the lifetime achievement award for emphasising the many ways of conveying emotions without the crutch of verbosity. “Artists live and die a thousand deaths on celluloid but the power of those performances is what makes us immortal. Not every actor leaves as much of an indelible mark though. Because not every actor is Irrfan,” said actor Ayushmann Khurrana while presenting the posthumous lifetime achievement award to Irrfan’s son Babil. “You know how people say you can’t fit into your father’s shoes. I fit into his clothes somehow,” said Babil, his voice choked with emotion while reminiscing the fact that his father was supposed to teach him acting after he returned from film school—a promise that would be thwarted by the hospital visit from which the actor would never come back. Resplendent in a shimmering white-and-blue gown and a beauty-queen-like tiara, actor Taapsee Pannu took home the iconic Black Lady trophy for best actor (female) for her self-assured portrayal of a housewife who refuses to turn the other cheek after being slapped by her husband in the film ‘Thappad’. If the svelte award could serve as Pannu’s weapon against type-casting directors, the trophy was a rare validation for actor Tillotama Shome, who won the critics award for best actor (female) for delicately conveying a domestic worker’s complicated feelings for her employer in the film ‘Sir’. “Thank you Filmfare for making space for actors of all kinds,” said Shome. Even as filmmaker Om Raut was adjudged best director for ‘Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior’, a historical film acclaimed for its rousing climax, the evening got its own high-octane climax when Anubhav Sinha’s slow-slap in the face of patriarchal conditioning ‘Thappad’ prevailed over the other biggest contender of the evening: Anurag Basu’s black comedy ‘Ludo’. ‘Thappad’ won not only best film but also best story, among other awards. Locked into the glossy bubble of Goregaon Film City’s Studio 16, the mask-and-negative-Covid-report-toting invitees of the ceremony attained temporary herd immunity from worries. “Aapka time aayega,” reassured hosts Rajkummar Rao and Riteish Deshmukh while urging the room to take the Covid-19 jab. With the entry of host Manish Paul, the stage became its own Over-The-Top platform. “Pehle Valentine manate the, ab quarantine mana rahe hain,” said Paul, dusting off his best Amitabh Bachchan impression. The whistles and cheers that ensued in the wake of each of the evening’s powerhouse performers—Hrithik Roshan, Sunny Leone, Sara Ali Khan, Nora Fatehi and Ayushmann Khurrana— made cinema-hall romantics homesick for the giddy community experience of the big screen.

The judiciary has to work and discharge its duties and must be left completely free,” he said, adding that social media is empowering, and enables people to criticise the Prime Minister and ask questions. “Social media is part of a healthy democracy. Therefore we all encourage that. But of late, I’ve been noticing a rather disturbing trend,” he said. Acknowledging how well companies adapted to the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, Prasad said, “During the pandemic, IT companies were shocked that they couldn’t operate from their offices, but today, 85% of India’s IT operations have shifted to the ‘work from home’ system,” he said, pointing out that the judiciary too rose to the occasion by hearing 82 lakh cases through videoconferencing during the pandemic. The Supreme Court heard 59,309 cases, the high courts 27,58,560 cases and subordinate courts 54,46,876 cases, while the Bombay high court, including its Goa bench, heard 64,823 cases through videoconferencing. Although there were no planes, trains and no movement on highways during the pandemic, the country was kept functional by all his departments, with people taking to their phones and the internet, Prasad said. Besides the judiciary, digital India saw seminars and students’ examinations moving online, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/trolling-judges-on-social-media-unacceptable/articleshow/81729003.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Kochi||“To speak politics, first we should have a head”||There have been charges that RMP has diluted its Left political ideology by accepting the support of Congress and UDF. What is your response? CPM and LDF don't have the moral or political right to say that. With whose support did two of their three MPs got elected? How can CPM which has just 2% vote share in the country take on communal forces? In Kerala we are fighting political fascism which is of utmost importance. We are remaining alive here because of the support we have been receiving from secular and democratic forces. For us to speak politics, first we should have our heads in place. The people here have been facing the terrible situation of not being able to speak any different kind of politics. To oppose such political fascism, the support of secular democratic forces is needed. CPM had faced unprecedented public revolt by cadres in nearby constituencies like Kuttiyadi over candidate selection. Will that benefit you in the polls? Are you expecting support from traditional CPM supporters in the election? Yes, definitely. Many CPM supporters were anguished over the murder of T P Chandrasekharan. I still come across many persons in that party who harbour strong objections and they often become very emotional while speaking about it. They would register their protests in the election. We are not receiving even the justice and protection that the murderers are receiving from the party. I don't say that those convicted should not get justice. But what is the political message that is being spread when party leaders, including MLAs, are taking the lead to build houses for the convicts and even solemnizing their marriages. It gives out the message that party approves of their actions and stands by them. Your demand for a CBI probe into the TP Chandrasekharan murder and investigation into the larger conspiracy behind it has not materialized. Do you think that you are yet to receive full justice? We are yet to get complete justice in the case as the master brains behind the murder and the people behind them are still outside. The two cases I have filed seeking CBI probe and investigation into the larger conspiracy behind the murder are still before the high court. The fact that the investigations didn't go any further had caused deep pain to me. I wish to take the fight for that forward and my candidature too is part of that. The issue of not giving adequate representation to women had come up during the candidate selection this time also. Your thoughts on it? The situation is the same in all political parties. The leadership positions are all being occupied by men and we are not been able to bring about a change in that situation. No meaningful intervention is being made on that front except for 50% reservation in elected members in LSG bodies. There is not much difference between CPM and Congress in addressing the issue. How much representation has the party which organised Women's Wall given to women?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/to-speak-politics-first-we-should-have-a-head/articleshow/81728572.cms||---

Temperatures, which have remained mostly above normal this month, are likely to rise further from Sunday. According to the forecast of India Meteorological Department (IMD), the day temperature may touch 36 degrees Celsius on Sunday and go up to 38 degrees Celsius on Monday. The maximum temperature on Saturday was 35.3 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal, at Safdarjung — city’s base station. Before this, the mercury had touched 35.3 degrees Celsius on March 18, the warmest day of the year so far. On Saturday, the day temperature was highest at Sports Complex at 36.1 degrees Celsius and followed by Najafgarh at 36 degrees Celsius. Met officials said a steep rise in mercury is predicted over the next three days. “As March is about to get over and there are no chances of any western disturbance impacting the region in the next few days, temperatures are set to rise,” said a Met official. “Most days this month saw temperatures above normal.” The minimum temperature on Saturday was 16.4 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal. The minimum temperature may rise slightly on Sunday to 17 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality remained in the upper-end of ‘moderate’ category on Saturday, with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 199. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences said: “Surface winds are moderate and Southwesterly. Better ventilation is likely to influence AQI positively. The index reading is likely to stay in the ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ category for the next two days.

The government was under pressure from the National Commission for Minority, BJP and the Jain community, demanding to revise the time table since April 25 is coinciding with Mahavir Jayanti. However, the official statement doesn’t recognise this reason for the change. It reads, “Since CM Ashok Gehlot in the budget has announced to provide economically weaker sections (EWS) candidates to appear in the exam (under the revised rules) is a reason that it stands cancelled.” In the Budget, Gehlot had announced age relaxation and fee waiver for EWS candidates in service rules as per other reserved categories. Quoting Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE), DP Jaroli, the statement further added that as per the direction from CM Ashok Gehlot, the board will allow the EWS quota aspirants to appear in the exam under revised rules. “The dates/schedule for the same will be released soon,” said Jaroli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/reet-date-shifted-to-june-20/articleshow/81728571.cms||---
---||Goa||After banning Holi, Shigmo festivities, govt opens mega fair||Panaji: A day after the state government cancelled the official Shigmo parades over concerns of rising Covid-19 cases, citizens have accused the state government of adopting double standards. They questioned why a major event such as Hunar Haat, where several hundred stalls have been set up, has been allowed to go ahead. The government’s move to permit Hunar Haat, which is being organised at Kala Academy, could lead to a further increase in Covid-19 cases in the state capital, said citizens. Panaji has the highest number of Covid cases, with 178 people actively infected by the virus. This has prompted many to demand that all public events in the capital be cancelled. “The government does not seem to be speaking and acting in one voice on this crucial issue, which concerns the health and well-being of the citizens,” said advocate Aires Rodrigues. “While the government has officially banned public festivals and large gatherings including Holi and Shigmo, the authorities are conveniently acting as mere spectators in selective cases.” Chief minister Pramod Sawant, along with Union minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Ayush minister Shripad Naik and Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Tendulkar inaugurated the Hunar Haat festival for indigenous artisans and craftsmen. Given that just a day earlier, Sawant had said that the government is concerned about the rise in Covid cases, many residents took to social media asking if the government is serious and truly concerned about taking preventive measures to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The state also imposed Section 144 in the state, restricting public celebrations and gatherings in public spaces, parks and grounds in the state. “It is strange that on one hand, Shigmo and Holi festivities have been cancelled, while on the other, big events like Hunar Haat are being organised and officially promoted. Such events draw large crowds, throwing social distancing out of the window,” said former Panaji deputy mayor, Kabir Pinto Makhija. While the state promptly declared certain residential complexes as micro-containment zones, the state failed to initiate similar action against the off-shore casino where 31 staff tested positive for Covid-19.  “This rank double standard by the government is a matter of concern, and only demonstrates the lack of will to take decisive measures to safeguard the lives of the people,” said Rodrigues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-banning-holi-shigmo-festivities-govt-opens-mega-fair/articleshow/81729005.cms||---

Godse took out a bullock-cart procession on Friday before filing her papers. She told the media that she would not withdraw even if the party took some other decision. “I was willing to contest in 2019, but withdrew as the seat was given to the BJP. This will not happen again,” she said. Godse said she has been fighting for public issues and was under pressure from people to fight the election. Several Sena workers were present when Gode filed her papers. Meanwhile, a delegation of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) met its president Raju Shetti to take a formal call on contesting the election. They said the MVA government was not doing anything for the farmers. While SSS is yet to take a formal decision, sources in the SSS said Raju Shetti was inclined to contest the election. SSS functionary Sachin Patil has already filed his nomination papers. BJP and NCP are yet to decide on their candidates. NCP is inclined to nominate a family member of late Bharat Bhelke. Sources said it can be Bhelke’s wife Jayshree or his son Bhagirath. BJP is closely watching the developments in the NCP. Samadhan Autade, who had asked for the party ticket last time, is in touch with the BJP leadership. Both the parties are under pressure from the dominant Dhangar community to field Dhangar candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/senas-godse-files-nomination-for-byelection/articleshow/81726981.cms||---

Since the drive bagan two weeks ago, the Kolhapur division of the Mahavitaran has recovered more than Rs 75 crore.However, this recovered amount is still far less than the current dues worth Rs 193 crore. Interestingly, more than 50% of the consumers who faced disconnection have turned now paid (at least a part of) their dues and have got the connections restored. Roughly, 5,849 connections were disconnected and of them, 3,299 have been restored.Prabhakar Nirmale, the chief engineer of the Kolhapur division of Mahavitaran, said: “Consumers are allowed to pay the dues in installments. They have given in writing the difficulties they face while paying dues in a single go. Most domestic consumers had not paid the dues in the past year and such consumers are facing difficulties in paying the dues in one go. We have asked the local staff to ensure immediate restoration of the supply after a part-payment is made. Still, many have not paid up and we urge them to pay before March 31 to avoid hefty fines and disconnection.”Around Rs 133 crore was paid by the domestic consumers who have cleared bills of the past year, Rs 31 crore had been recovered from commercial establishments and Rs 34 crore from industrial establishments. Only four days are left for the end of the financial year. Divisional officials have directed local staff to keep bill collection centres open till late night on March 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/50-kolhapur-users-pay-power-dues-since-disconnection-drive/articleshow/81726999.cms||---
---||Noida||Holi rush, lack of FASTag at Jewar toll plaza lead to a traffic chaos||NOIDA: A rush back home for a three-day Holi break led to a 3km long snarl at the Jewar toll plaza on Saturday morning. The volume of traffic increased substantially on the Noida-Agra carriageway of the Yamuna Expressway as thousands of people from across NCR headed for various districts of UP to celebrate Holi with their family members. What aided the traffic chaos was the lack of FASTags at the toll plaza. Travellers took to social media to voice their anger and tagged the official handles of the chief minister and Union minister Nitin Gadkari to ask why the digital mode of payment had not been implemented yet on the expressway. While many people had left for home early in the morning, the effect of the traffic rush started showing from 9am onwards. It continued till 3pm and eased somewhat towards the evening. But the snarls resumed late in the evening. Jitendra Singh, who had reached the Jewar toll plaza around 6.45am, had to spend 15 minutes to make the payment and move ahead. He voiced his protest on Twitter. “Why the toll is not digitised. Where is your promise?” he tweeted, tagging the official twitter handles of the NHAI and minister Gadkari. Rakesh Swami also posed a question on the lack of FASTags at the toll plaza. “Poor implementation of Digital India programme at Yamuna Expressway, the Jewar toll plaza with no FASTag implementation. People are wasting more than an hour to cross and the concept of Express Highway is defeated. Appropriate your quick action,” he tweeted. Swami had tagged the official handles of Gadkari, chief minister Yogi Adityanath and the Prime Minister’s Office. Mayank Dixit, a Noida resident who was heading home to Etawah, demanded that the toll be waived till the time the expressway is cleared of the jam. “They can at least waive the toll till the time the snarl gets cleared. This is not the kind of convenience for which we are paying toll,” he added. Mayank asked why the FASTag system was yet to be implemented on the Yamuna Expressway when most other highways across the country had adopted it. “The Yamuna Expressway is also in the same country. I am a frequent traveller on this expressway. If this is the situation of private tolls, the government should start controlling them. If we have to wait so much, why should we pay the toll?” asked Mayank, a news and features provider to mobile phone companies. As the line of vehicles started getting longer, senior traffic police officers reached the spot and tried to manage the situation. The toll officials were asked to increase the number of machines for payment. DCP (traffic) Ganesh Saha said the toll officials had started a token system to help commuters make payments faster. The move somewhat eased the situation and the queue of vehicles started getting shorter with time. But the expressway still felt the load of traffic till late in the evening. At the Luharli toll on NH-34, the situation was largely similar on the carriageway towards Bulandshahr in the evening. Asked why FASTags were getting delayed on the Yamuna Expressway, Anuj Jain, the interim resolution professional (IRP) for Jaypee Infratech Limited, the speedway operator, said they had awarded the contract to a bank seven-10 days earlier. “Now, it is the bank’s responsibility to implement the system. They are working on it,” he added..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/holi-rush-lack-of-fastag-at-jewar-toll-plaza-lead-to-a-traffic-chaos/articleshow/81728580.cms||Shikha Salaria

Monkey menace also poses a threat to life in the town. A 15-year-old boy, Mahendra Soni, was killed in attack by a money while he was coming downstairs from rooftop of his private school building. However, the municipality is yet to act on the menace. Chandana called a meeting of 25 councillors of the municipality to discuss on issues related to development, sanitation in the town on Friday when all of them raised the pig and money menace in the town. On receiving feedback from municipal officials, the minister directed the official to issue suspension order to the sanitary workers, reportedly dealing with pig farming and allowing their pigs to roma in the town. Executive officer of municipality Mahima Dangi issued ordered to suspended the 9 sanitary workers, who were earlier served notices to remove their pets from the marketplace but they turned a deaf ear.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pig-menace-9-sanitation-workers-suspended/articleshow/81728576.cms||---
---||Lucknow||CM Yogi Adityanath launches Rs 334 crore projects in Bahraich||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday, unveiled a statue of Maharana Pratap in Bahraich, recalling sacrifices of nationalists like him and Chhatrapati Shivaji, whose valour is still invoked by parents while blessing their children. The chief minister also inaugurated and laid the foundation of various development works of Rs 334 crore and announced a new medical college in the district. “The last time I came to Bahraich was when we laid the foundation of a memorial of Raja Suheldev, who crushed foreign invaders,” the CM said, referring to Bahraich king, who defeated Ghazi Salar Masud in 11th century. “Had India heeded his heroic deed, Mughals would not have dared to set foot in India,” the CM said. Talking about Maharana Pratap, he said, “Born in Rajasthan, the Rajput king too fought foreign invaders and displayed bravery akin to Suheldev to defend the country when its culture and religion was under threat.” While announcing a new medical college in Bahraich, he said, the institute would improve healthcare of residents of not only Bahraich, but also those living in adjacent districts. Earlier, the chief minister laid foundation of projects worth Rs 264 crore and inaugurated schemes worth Rs 70 crore, mostly related to flood control, water supply, irrigation, roads and other basic amenities. “Bahraich is one of eight aspirational districts of Uttar Pradesh and we are collaborating with the Centre to ensure swift development in health, education and drinking water. Work done by us in past four years has shown positive results,” he said. Since Bahraich was part of the Terai region, the district was prone to communicable diseases, particularly meningitis, the CM said, the government would extend the piped water scheme under Jal Jeevan Mission to the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-launches-rs-334cr-projects-in-bahraich/articleshow/81729011.cms||---

Parents of prospective students run pillar to post to get their children admitted to the mere five or six major private schools, all of which were established four decades ago. Vizag city has not seen much activity in the private school space in the last 30–40 years with the exception of some corporate chains setting up schools in nooks and corners of the city. But these corporate schools, which have little infrastructure and no playgrounds, are the last resort of parents. Even though some ‘global’ brands in private schooling have forayed into Vizag over the last few years, they have largely remained out-of-pocket for the middle classes. Educationists in the city say that there is need to set up an ‘education’ hub on lines of the health city in Arilova to offer quality education at affordable prices in the age of digital learning. Venu Mohan Manga, secretary and correspondent of Little Angels School at MVP Colony, says that the few good private schools in Vizag see fierce competition for admission. “The competition can be gauged from the fact that we alone receive thousands of intent forms. Vizag should have more affordable quality schools to make students critical thinkers and all-rounders,” Manga said while adding that the need of the hour is to encourage and support good schools that contribute to quality education. Narava Prakasa Rao, secretary of Bala Vikas Foundation (BVF), said, “Unfortunately, choices for private schooling in the city are limited. It has been more acutely felt with the increasing population in the recent decades. The government may consider developing an education hub offering land at somewhat lower prices to the best institutions while imposing restrictions on fee structure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/dearth-of-good-private-schools-in-vizag-worries-parents/articleshow/81727502.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Fraudsters siphon off bank money of businessman without contacting him||VADODARA: Cyber fraudsters have devised a new way of cheating people wherein they don’t contact the victims and manage to transfer the money without getting any details from them. One such conman was arrested by the Cyber Crime police station on Friday from Jodhpur who, along with five others, had siphoned off Rs 14.7 lakh from the bank account of Jawaharlal Yadav, a businessman living in Gorwa. The 20-year-old accused Lalitkumar Rathore had received Rs 1.5 lakh in his payments bank account from Yadav’s cash credit account . Five others accused too received the remaining amount in their payments bank accounts. Yadav, who is into the business of industrial construction, was never contacted by any of the accused nor did he share any one-time password with anyone, yet the money got debited. He only realized it when he checked the bank statement in December last year. Interestingly, the daily withdrawal limit in Yadav’s account was Rs 10 lakh, yet the entire amount of Rs 14.7 lakh was debited on the same day. “We are investigating how the money got debited without the account holder’s consent. The bank has informed us that the internet protocol (IP) addresses that were involved in the transactions were of Switzerland and India,” said assistant commissioner of police Hardik Makadiya. Police suspect that fraudsters may have used a virtual private network (VPN). During interrogation, Rathore told police that he does not know the other people who received money in their accounts. He claimed that he had received a message on Telegram messaging app regarding a job offer. Under the job conditions, he was supposed to receive money and share 50% of it with the job provider. However, after receiving Rs 1.5 lakh Rathore used all the money and disconnected from Telegram app. “We suspect it is part of a larger conspiracy where the masterminds siphon off money and park it in the bank accounts of people like Rathore. However, in this case Rathore too is equally responsible as he received the money and used it,” Makadiya added. Rathore was arrested in the past too by Pratapnagar police station of Jodhpur in connection with a burglary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/fraudsters-siphon-off-bank-money-of-businessman-without-contacting-him/articleshow/81727421.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Ranchi hospitals prepares to handle pregnancy cases amid Covid surge||RANCHI: Taking lessons from the problems faced by pregnant women during the outbreak of the pandemic last year, the Ranchi district health authorities have strengthened the maternal and child clinic at the district hospital anticipating a possible surge in the Covid-19 infections in the city. From deploying dedicated staff for screening and testing of pregnant women arriving at the district hospital to increasing the capacity of the special newborn care unit (SNCU), the district health authorities have decided to keep the services available round the clock. Talking to TOI, district civil surgeon Dr V B Prasad said, “Patients with non-Covid ailments had experienced inconvenience after the outbreak last year. To prevent a rerun of such a situation, our Covid-19 testing labs will work round the clock at the sadar hospital so that no patient faces problems while getting admission, which requires Covid-19 negative test reports.” Notably, several pregnant women were denied admission during the initial days of the outbreak last year as they didn’t have a negative Covid-19 test report. A few patients had also suffered miscarriages as they weren’t attended to and admitted timely admission. Dr Prasad said, “A lab technician along with a computer operator will be available round the clock to collect Covid-19 samples and smooth admission of pregnant women at the district hospital. Instructions have been given to duty doctors as well as other paramedics and nursing staff to ensure that no such patients face any problems.” Meanwhile, DC Chhavi Ranjan visited the sadar hospital and inaugurated the extended SNCU ward which caters to newborns. Talking to TOI, Ranjan said, “We have added four new baby warmers along with other required medical equipment at our SNCU unit. The addition has been done keeping the increased deliveries at the district hospital in mind so that the newborns are taken care of properly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-hosp-prepares-to-handle-pregnancy-cases-amid-cov-surge/articleshow/81728960.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Palm Sunday church processions called off||RANCHI: In view of the rising Covid figures, the Roman Catholic Church cancelled its traditional Palm Sunday procession after it had recently decided to shorten the 1-km walk between Loyola Ground on Purulia Road to Albert Ekka Chowk to 400 metre. However, a state government order against congregations changed the church’s mind and the procession was called off. Ranchi district, till Friday, had 706 active Covid cases. In normal times, devotees walk a distance of a kilometre and wave olive branches to mark Jesus’s entry into Jerusalem before being crucified. Palm Sunday marks the beginning of the celebrations of the Holy Week leading to Easter. “Church services will continue throughout Easter to commemorate the crucifixion and the resurrection of our Lord,” Bishop Theodore Mascarenhas, auxiliary bishop of Ranchi, told TOI. We will abide by all Covid regulations, the Bishop stressed. Meanwhile, St. Mary’s Cathedral said on Maundy Thursday, which marks Jesus’s last supper, which falls on April 1, the church has fixed specific timings for services for the faithful. “On Good Friday, we practice a devotion known as Veneration of the Cross, wherein the clergy and the congregation approach the crucifix one by one, kneel down before it and kiss it. This year, we have disallowed any direct kiss to the cross. Instead, paper napkins will be distributed to all in advance. Each one present would be permitted to touch the crucifix only with a paper napkin, which they can kiss later. All napkins will be needed to be discarded in special bins kept for the purpose. The used paper napkins will later be incinerated,” Mascarenhas told TOI. The 175-year-old Gossner Evangelical Lutheran (GEL) Church said they will abide by all government regulations to prevent the spread of Covid through mass gatherings. “Church services during Easter will be restricted to the church halls only. GEL does not organise marches to observe Palm Sunday, hence the ban on processions announced by the state government do not apply to us. We are waiting for further directives from the state and Union governments,” said Johan Dang, moderator of GEL Church. Last year, when the spread of the virus was at its peak, GEL, for the first time in the history, had put off all in-person church services and put in place live streaming of the mass. “This year, we have put live streaming facilities on a standby, which would be put to use in case of need,” Dang said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/palm-sunday-church-processions-called-off/articleshow/81728968.cms||Tapas Biswas

The state has also received its first consignment of the vaccine for the new drive and it will be carried out at session sites identified at district headquarters and panchayat areas starting April 1. The state health department has started arrangements for the drive soon after the fresh consignment of vaccines landed in Ranchi on Friday afternoon. Talking to TOI, Dr Ajit Prasad, the nodal officer for the vaccination in the state, said, “We have received a fresh stock of 4,29,690 dosages of Covishield on Friday which will be used for the vaccination drive starting April 1. Anyone aged 45 and above will be eligible to take the vaccines at our session sites by providing their identification and age proof.” Prasad also said, “We are targeting to vaccinate around 83 lakh people or around 25% of the total population. They include healthcare and frontline workers apart from people above 45 years of age. Currently, we have been able to vaccinate around 16 lakh beneficiaries and we will be trying our best to cover the targeted population at the earliest.” On the status of vaccine supply to Jharkhand, Prasad said “We haven’t faced any difficulty in the supply since the launch of vaccination drive and we have been assured that timely delivery of the vaccine will continue.” Meanwhile, healthcare experts have welcomed the government’s move on expanding the inoculation drive and said that it will help in building immunity and decreasing the severity of the infection among the population. They, however, warned that people should maintain social distancing and the authorities should also make arrangements at the session sites after the drive is widened to cover a large section of the population. Public health expert and professor of community medicine at Rims, Dr Dewesh Kumar, said, “The move to expand the vaccination is a welcome step as it will reduce the risk of severity of infection among those who might develop an infection after the first dose or even before that. Moreover, vaccinating such a large chunk of the population will also help in strengthening the herd immunity which is again a bright side for us against the virus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/vax-consignment-for-people-aged-45-and-above-arrives/articleshow/81728953.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Till Friday, the district had 195 active cases. The administration appealed people to cooperate in preventing the spread of the virus during the festival and barred large gatherings at public places. Around 2,000 policemen and 150 magistrates have been deployed on law and order duty in the district. From Sunday to Tuesday, the district control room will be in operation at the Composite Crime Control (CCR) building at Sakchi police station. Dhalbhum executive magistrate Chandradev Prasad has been made the in-charge of the control room. Officers in-charge of all the police stations in the district have been asked to increase the frequency of patrolling to keep eye on the trouble makers during holi. The administration has announced closure of the liquor shops on Holi and imposed ban on the entry of the heavy commercial vehicles into the city from 6 am to 11 pm on Holi. Meanwhile, shopkeepers selling Holi items said sales are yet to pick up. “I hope Sunday will see a rush of buyers,” said Vijay Agarwal, a shopkeeper selling Holi items at Sakchi market. Environmentalist K K Sharma urged festive enthusiasts to avoid water for playing Holi. “Even at home, avoid the use of water for playing Holi. Water is a scarce resource and shouldn’t be wasted for fun,” he said. Coming out in support of the prohibitory orders, functionary of Khalsa Club Balvinder Singh said, “Festive gatherings could invite a surge in Covid cases, hence, the best way to celebrate this year is to enjoy with family members at home and avoid the risk of contracting the virus.” Senior doctor of the city Mrityunjay Singh advised Holi enthusiasts to play with traditional colours made of flower. “Colours are made of chemicals which cause irritation to the skin, hence, we should apply traditional colours,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-holi-gatherings-in-east-singbhum-alcohol-shops-to-remain-shut/articleshow/81728981.cms||B Sridhar

---||Vijayawada||Two Guntur-Hyderabad highway stretches get NH status||GUNTUR: In what could be a boost for the development of Palnadu in Guntur district, the Union road transport and highways ministry has declared two separate stretches on Guntur-Hyderabad state highway as National Highway. The existing two-lane highway will be developed as four-lane highway at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore. The upgradation of the existing narrow highway to National Highway would also save several lives every year as this state highway has become one of the deadliest accident zones in the state. Continuous lobbying by MP Lavu Srikrishnadevarayalu for over a year yielded the result as the Union road transport and highways ministry finally issued gazette notification to recognize Perecherla-Kondamodu, Dachepalle-Macherla state highway as National Highway. Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had promised to look into the issue when it was first brought to his notice by Srikrishnadevarayalu nearly a year ago. Gadkari had not only directed officials to submit a feasibility report on the MP’s representation but also followed it up with the officials. Based on the report, Gadkari gave his green signal to upgrade both highways in the state as National Highway two days ago. Following the instructions of the Gadkari, the ministry issued gazette notification. “This is a big achievement for Palnadu region. The development of Guntur-Hyderabad highway and Dachepalle-Macherla highway, which has been pending for several decades, will now take off thanks to its conversion as National Highway,” said Srikrishnadevarayalu. The state government had been struggling to widen both stretches for several years as the highway is witnessing heavy traffic. However, shortage of funds with the state roads and buildings department had delayed the road widening work. The conversion of Perecherla-Kondamodu and Dachepalle-Macherla stretches as NH would help increase the goods transport sector and vehicles moving from industries in Prakasam and Nellore districts. This would also encourage investors to come with more industries in Palnadu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/2-guntur-hyd-highway-stretches-get-nh-status/articleshow/81727516.cms||Samdani MN

The body of an unidentified man, estimated to be around 70 years old, was washed ashore at Seethapalem in Visakhapatnam district on Friday night. The revenue department informed the cops. Police, led by sub-inspector Arun Kiran, visited the spot and called on locals to identify the body. But locals could not identify the deceased. Consequently, the body was required to be preserved for 72 hours at the mortuary. But bringing the body from the shore to the police vehicle was an uphill task as the road to the coast was not amenable to vehicular movement. "We requested villagers, but no one came forward as the body had decomposed and was emitting a distinct odour," said a police official. When no one came forward to shift the body, sub-inspector Kiran along with his team comprising Dora Masen, Narsinga Rao and Kondababu carried the body on a makeshift stretcher for three kilometres along the coast to the police vehicle. Later, the body was shifted to a mortuary at Yelamanchili.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/police-carry-dead-body-on-shoulders/articleshow/81727541.cms||Nalla.Babu

The rock is stuck in the sand dunes of the river and is located near the ancient Lord Koteswara Swamy temple and the century-old bridge on the river. The team visited the spot on Saturday to collect evidence to bring it to the notice of higher officials. Speaking to TOI, Srikakulam district tourism officer N Narayana Rao said, “We have taken photos, videos and impressions of the ancient script and carvings which appear to be Shivalinga. Archaeological experts from Visakhapatnam will visit the spot for further studies.” Sources informed that the inscriptions were similar to those belonging to the era of Chalukya dynasty of Badami. On the basis of this information, officials have preliminarily assumed that the inscriptions may belong to the Eastern Chalukyas or the Chalukyas of Vengi, the dynasty that ruled parts of south India between seventh and twelfth centuries. Archaeology department assistant director S Venkateswara Rao said, “We can officially announce the period and the history of our discoveries in Srikakulam only after some technical studies.

While water supply from the Krishna river is adequate for the 12 lakh population in the city, tail-end areas of Vijayawada pose a challenge for the civic body every summer. Residents of Jakkampudi Colony, Chittinagar hilltop and other neighbourhoods struggle to locate sources of potable water in peak summer. Further, transmission losses due to damaged pipelines affect water supply in these areas. Minor repair works by the VMC have failed to yield results. Authorities of the civic body have resolved that every household shall get potable drinking water this summer. VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh, mayor R Bhagyalakshmi and officers of the engineering wing approved the repair of old pipelines before peak summer hits. Authorities estimate that water demand will increase to 160 million litres per day during summer and reservoirs and tanks will have to be cleaned to maintain gross storage levels. In a bid to overcome problems in hilly terrain, the VMC will install water boosters to pump the water. “The VMC is spending Rs 10 crores per annum on drinking water supply. We have additionally allocated Rs 75 lakhs to implement an action plan. Endowments minister Vellampalli Srinivas explained problems faced in Vijayawada West constituency. We are taking measure to ensure no one suffers drinking water shortage this summer,” Prasanna Venkatesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vmc-readies-plan-to-ensure-drinking-water/articleshow/81727615.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Goa||New school at IIT to study ailments among local popn||PANAJI: A school of interdisciplinary life sciences has been established at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Goa. Its immediate focus will be public health and on analysing the reasons behind occurrence of specific ailments among locals. The IIT has already received approval from the central government to set up a life sciences laboratory. Equipment worth Rs 2.7 crore is expected to be purchased to enable biology-related investigations and research. MTech and PhD students at IIT Goa will get the benefit of working in this new laboratory. “The school of interdisciplinary life sciences will start out by focusing on public health. It will see an amalgamation of ideas from the fields of engineering and life sciences. Public health means creating awareness, education among people,” said IIT Goa director Prof BK Mishra. He said researchers at the school will aim to find answers to questions such as why Goans are prone to certain types of kidney ailments or cancers. Mishra said an immediate focus of the school of interdisciplinary life sciences will be to study how Covid-19 growth and spread takes place locally. The school will also educate the general public about availability and effectiveness of vaccines, among other things, he said. “More and more researchers are working now on drug development and mechanics of cells, etc. It is an important interdisciplinary programme. The school of interdisciplinary life sciences will draw expertise from different departments of the institute in the areas of life sciences, chemistry, biology, computer science, mechanical engineering,” Mishra said. Though the school will have lab equipment worth Rs 2.7 crore available to researchers, together with that of other departments, the equipment to be utilised for the research will be of upto Rs 10 crore. As IIT Goa is presently experiencing space constraints, still operating from its temporary campus at Farmagudi, the institute will have to wait until full-fledged degree programmes can be offered at the new school. “In the near future we will introduce BSc in biological science and a graduate programme in public health,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-school-at-iit-to-study-ailments-among-local-popn/articleshow/81729127.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Business||US proposes tit-for-tat tariffs over e-commerce tax||WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI: The United States Trade Representative (USTR) has proposed retaliatory trade actions against India and certain other countries that have imposed or are considering equalisation levy/digital services tax on e-commerce firms. It has issued notices seeking public comments on proposed trade actions against six countries, including India. A USTR statement said it "is proceeding with the public notice and comment process on possible trade actions to preserve procedural options before the conclusion of the statutory one-year time period for completing the investigations". According to a USTR document pertaining to India, it has requested "written comments regarding a potential trade action in connection with the Section 301 investigation of India's digital services tax". On this, sources in the government on Saturday said India will examine the proposed action with the stakeholders concerned and would take suitable measures, keeping in mind the trade and commercial interest of the country and overall interest of its people. In June 2020, the US initiated an investigation under Section 301 of the US Trade Act, 1974 against the taxation on digital services adopted or under consideration by India, Italy, Turkey, UK, Spain and Austria. The report of this investigation in January this year concluded that India's equalisation levy, by its structure and operation, discriminates against US digital companies. It was strongly opposed by India. USTR Katherine Tai has stated that the US is committed to working with its trading partners to resolve its concerns with digital services taxes and address broader issues of international taxation. "However, until such a consensus is reached, we will maintain our options under the Section 301 process, including, if necessary, the imposition of tariffs," Tai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/us-proposes-tit-for-tat-tariffs-over-e-commerce-tax/articleshow/81730423.cms||---

With current facilities, the British-era club can admit 60 aspirants for both courses. “We would soon be floating advertisements inviting applications from aspirants to join both courses. The eligibility would be Standard XII passout with physics, chemistry and mathematics (PCM). We would set up an experts’ panel to conduct interviews for selection,” division commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, who’s ex-officio chairman of the prestigious club, told TOI. He added that being a state government-run institution, the fees would be charged at subsidized rates. “We would be keeping Rs29.5 lakh as fees for each of the courses. The students would be provided top class training in all kinds of flying activities. We’ve tested three aircraft and the fourth one would be tested soon. All these would be available for their training,” Kumar said. Newly appointed maintenance manager at NFC Pragnesh Sisodia said the administration had appointed new staff for restarting the club after a gap of over three-and-half years. “We now have a staff of 20, which is sufficient for getting approvals from the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). Once flying activities commence, more members would be added.” Lauding the commissioner’s efforts, he added the entire team took big efforts to restart the club. “He gave attention to every minor requirement and ensured strict follow up with the authorities like DGCA for certification. Now, we’ve completed 90% of the work to start full-fledged flying activities,” he said. Advocate Shriniwas Deshpande, an NFC alumnus, who single-handedly fought the PIL for its reopening, hailed the administration’s decision. “I’ve been in touch with Indian Air Force (IAF) officials for restarting the old scheme of providing direct entry to National Cadet Corps (NCC) air wing branch. In the 1960s, NCC cadets like me used to get training at NFC and many of us have become full-time pilots in IAF and airliners. I would be contacting the Maharashtra NCC Battalion in the city so that they take the initiative in this regard. If the central government agrees to it, the NCC cadets would get free training at NFC at government expenses. This way, funding would be assured for the club.” Explaining the unlimited possibilities in the aviation sector for NFC students, Deshpande said they would be lucky ones to get training at NFC as it was close to Dr Babasaheb International Airport, which had the latest Air Traffic Controlling (ATC) equipment. “Besides, opportunities in IAF and commercial airliners, they can get high-paying jobs as pilots of private jets owned by various corporates and big businessmen,” he said, adding that Nagpur had ideal weather for flying for most of the year. # WHAT NFC WILL PROVIDE * Private Pilot License (PPL) * Commercial Private License (CPL) # TOTAL SEATS & FEES * Total seats – 60 * Total fees – Rs29.5 lakh * Selection – Through interviews * Available for training – 4 aircraft # OPPORTUNITIES GALORE * Indian Air Force (IAF) & Air India * Commercial airliners like Indigo, SpiceJet, Go Air & others * Private planes of corporate houses & business honchos # ADVANTAGES OF NFC * Located close to Nagpur international airport * Latest ATC equipment at airport to help aspirants * Ideal dry weather for flying training throughout year||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nfc-to-give-wings-to-60-students-to-fly-their-dreams/articleshow/81728305.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Nagpur||Sanjay Raut has become Sharad Pawar’s spokesperson, says Nana Patole||NAGPUR: State Congress chief Nana Patole expressed strong displeasure over Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s suggestion for a new UPA chairperson, a post which is currently headed by Sonia Gandhi. On Thursday, Raut had suggested Maratha strongman Sharad Pawar’s name as the UPA chief, which Congress members saw as a challenge to Gandhi. “We won’t tolerate any comments against our leader,” said Patole on Saturday. Speaking to TOI, Raut said his views were in the interest of a ‘united opposition’ at the national level and should not be construed as being against any particular person. An aggressive Patole did not mince words on the issue. He said, “Raut seems to have become a spokesperson for Pawar, not the Shiv Sena, considering the statements he is giving. Our stand is that Raut does not have the right to speak on the issue because Shiv Sena is not even a part of the UPA.” The Sakoli MLA said that this issue won’t end through just statements in the public domain by both parties. “I will be meeting chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and putting our party’s point of view. We cannot accept any person making these type of comments regarding Congress leaders,” said Patole. Raut, a Rajya Sabha MP, expressed surprise over the aggressive reaction by Patole. “Is it a crime to suggest Sharad Pawar’s name?” said Raut, over the phone from New Delhi. “It’s not mandatory to be part of UPA to suggest that the entire opposition needs to be united if they have to take on the BJP,” said Raut. The firebrand Sena leader stressed that his remarks were not against Sonia Gandhi. “For the last 17 years she has done a commendable job in leading the UPA, but you cannot ignore the ground reality. UPA has not progressed (electorally) and it’s a big concern for everyone,” said Raut. When asked if Gandhi family was not the ‘right face’ to lead UPA, Raut said, “See the BJP has just one face as leader, while the opposition has many. I feel Pawar should be the leader, similarly others are also free to suggest their choices, if they have one.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/raut-has-become-pawars-spokesperson-says-patole/articleshow/81728364.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

All cinema halls, malls, restaurants and auditoriums will also remain shut from 8pm to 7am. However, home delivery and takeaways from restaurants will be allowed as per the existing timings. The state government extended the lockdown, which was in place in the state, and the new curbs till April15. Officials said there has been no change in shops timings, though local administrations have been empowered to take decisions in their areas as per their conditions, with permission from the chief secretary. Every person found violating the new norms will be penalised Rs1,000. Places that flout rules will be shut till pandemic denotifiedEstablishments found violating the time restrictions or other guidelines will be shut down till the time Covid-19 continues to be notified as a pandemic, the state notification said. Penalties will also be levied under the Disaster Management Act. Penalties will also be levied under the Disaster Management Act. Hoteliers’ associations and malls’ representatives felt the fresh state order was akin to a full lockdown as it would badly hit evening shopping and the dine-in business. Shivanand Shetty, president of AHAR, the association of restaurants, said the curbs were “a death knell for many restaurants which have somehow survived last year’s lockdown.” He added, “While we share the concern of the government and the predicament it is in, we don’t see any logic in these latest restrictions as there is no proven research on the increase in spread of Covid during night. Also, it is the employees or workforce associated with the hospitality industry also who will suffer.” Tabrez Upletawala of Persian Darbar restaurant, Bandra, said dine-in and home delivery counted for 50-50 of his business, but losses will spiral. “Many people have already been avoiding non-vegetarian food since the pandemic. Now the customers we get will also be unable to come.” Rajendra Kalkar of High Street Phoenix Mall said, “Business will suffer, the food and beverage segment most of all. Malls are far safer than railway stations, vegetable markets and bus stands where people hardly follow Covid protocols.” Rima Kirtikar, chief marketing officer of Viviana Mall, said, “Early dining is not part of Mumbai’s culture. So home delivery is the best recourse for our restaurants to adapt to the new scenario.” Another mall representative said, “The hospitality industry is an easy target. We in fact are using and enforcing sanitisers, masks and physical distancing.” The state has also fixed the penalty to be levied on people without a mask at Rs 500. With this, there is uniformity in fines across the state, and Rs 1,000 is the fine for people found spitting in public places. To decrowd government offices, apart from elected representatives, other visitors will not be allowed without urgent work. And in that case, special passes will be issued by the department concerned. With the Centre pointing out that home isolation norms are being violated, the state has asked patients opting for home isolation to give their doctor’s information to local authorities, and it will be the doctor’s responsibility to ensure all norms are being followed and in case of a violation, the doctor should immediately intimate the authorities and withdraw his consent to supervise the patient. The state has also extended existing restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/8pm-to-7am-gatherings-of-5-banned-in-maharashtra-restaurants-to-be-shut/articleshow/81730463.cms||Bhavika Jain

The techno-feasibility report for leasing out berths 10 and 11 is also expected to be ready by mid-2021. However, sources at MPT expect the report to be delayed as the process to select a consultant has been delayed. MPT plans to create facilities for coal and bulk cargo handling and had floated an RFP to appoint consultants to prepare the techno-feasibility reports for the ambitious projects. While redevelopment of berth 9 and three barge jetties is expected to cost Rs 700-1,000 crore, the project to handover maintenance, operation of berths 10 and 11 will cost MPT Rs 100-200 crore. With iron ore exports severely impacted and port revenue down, MPT plans to explore new sources of revenue while reducing its own costs. Over time, MPT has slowly grown to become a coal handling port, a development that has rankled locals and environmentalists. MPT has seven cargo-handling berths, two of which are dedicated coal berths and one dedicated iron ore berth. MPT gave JSW control over berth number 6, while berth 7 is with Adani Mormugao Port Terminal Private Limited (AMPTPL). Berth number 9 is used for iron ore operations. MPT also has six mooring dolphins, isolated marine structures used to moor vessels. Redevelopment of berth 9 envisages creation of a 350-400 m long berth, reclamation of around 40,000 sqm of waterfront area and development of 1,30,000 sqm of land for backup. The present capacity of berths 10 and 11 is 6MMT per year and only general cargo is handled as these berths. The overall length of the berths is 520 m with an overall backup area of 1.4 lakh sqm where there are three warehouses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mpt-hopes-for-redevpt-feasibility-report-by-may/articleshow/81729224.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

IIT-Delhi to prepare plan||GHAZIABAD: To combat air pollution in the city, a tripartite agreement was signed between the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation, the UP Pollution Control Board and IIT-Delhi in the presence of Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar under the Centre’s National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) on Friday. A sum of Rs 60 crore has also been sanctioned for Ghaziabad to tackle the problem of air pollution, officials said. Track the pollution level in your cityGhaziabad is in the list of 122 non-attainment cities that have been identified across the country based on the ambient air quality data from 2014-2018. While UPPCB has already prepared a short-term and a long-term action plan for tackling air pollution in the city, IIT-Delhi will provide technical inputs and analyse data to further improve action points, officials said. Mahendra Singh Tawar, municipal commissioner, said, “Ghaziabad, over the past many years, has earned the dubious tag of being the country’s most-polluted city, but the Union government aims to reduce particulate matter by 30% in its 122 non-attainment cities that have been identified across the country. A sum of Rs 60 crore has been sanctioned after the tripartite pact was sealed on Friday.” “As part of the agreement, IIT-Delhi will provide technical inputs and analyse data to further improve on our action plan to combat air pollution in the district,” added Tawar, who had accompanied mayor Asha Sharma to Delhi for inking the pact. According to officials, GMC has identified heads under which it plans to allocate funds for reducing air pollution in the city. “These include Rs 10 crore each for constructing stone blocks to check roadside dust pollution and restoration of green belts. We have also earmarked Rs 20 crore for development of 200 parks within municipal limits while a certain amount will be spent on procuring anti-smoke guns and on conversion of diesel vehicles to CNG,” said Tawar. The UPPCB’s action plan for controlling air pollution in Ghaziabad has already been vetted by the Union environment ministry and “work is on for its implementation”. “We have covered all the causes of air pollution — vehicular, industrial, construction, road dust pollution and open air garbage burning — under the plan,” Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, told TOI. “Plying of electric buses for public transport including establishment of adequate charging stations, maintaining at least 33% forest cover in the city, and launching extensive drives against open burning of biomass, crop residue, garbage and leaves, are some of the measures suggested to bring down air pollution levels in the city,” he added. Meanwhile, IIT Delhi would also be providing technical support and knowledge to UPPCB in GB Nagar matters of air quality monitoring and pollution control. However, there is no funding for the district till now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/how-to-tackle-air-pollution-in-gzb-iit-del-to-prepare-plan/articleshow/81729219.cms||Abhijay Jha

Radiation oncologist Dr Ashish Bhange and his team conducted the procedure at the HCG Cancer Centre. “The patient was evaluated for progressively increasing hearing deficit in left ear associated with weakness on left half of face since past three years. MRI was done earlier, but the tumour was so tiny that it was not detected in the MRI,” Dr Bhange told TOI. As the suffering increased, the patient reached the HCG Hospital and a fresh MRI done after three years diagnosed a small non-cancerous brain tumour. The tumour known as acoustic schwannoma arises from VIII cranial nerve which functions for hearing and balancing in human body. So, patients generally suffer from hearing loss. In this case, the patient was diagnosed with a very small 8 x 4 x 3 mm tumour. “In case of such small tumours, treatment strategy includes watchful observation, radiosurgery or neurosurgery. The patient was very young. Observation strategy could have been hazardous as the tumour may have grown bigger in future resulting in neurological deficit. So, doctors must have decided to treat it with advanced radiological technique,” said neurosurgeon Dr Ninad Shrikhande. Dr Shrikhande said the technique is the most advanced and very effective in this field. “Radiosurgery has a word surgery in it but the process is not actually surgical,” said Dr Bhange. It involves high dose ionizing radiation beams focused on tumour with great precision and accuracy with intent of tumour ablation. “The tumour was targeted but the brain cells were completely protected. It will take time for the tumour to diminish completely, but it will not grow further. The patient has been saved from any further damage,” he said. Small tumours are usually not treatable by surgical intervention. Waiting them to grow to a certain size is not advisable as it may create further problems. So, the radiosurgery is in practice worldwide for various brain, spine, lung, pancreas, prostate and liver tumour. The advanced technology and machines for this process are now available in several hospitals, especially cancer hospitals in Nagpur. PROCEDURE WITHOUT CUT - Tumour measured 0.2cc, which arguably is one of the smallest such brain tumour - Targeted radiological treatment was delivered in single session - State-of-the-art radiosurgery technique on latest Truebeam STx LINAC X-knife was used - Treatment completed in 20 minutes, no invasion, or anaesthesia or blood loss - Tumour won’t grow now, will become weak in months, diminish in 18-24 months||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tiny-brain-tumour-results-in-hearing-loss-treated-by-radiosurgery/articleshow/81728385.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The foetus was sent to Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, for preservation, while police began investigations in the case. Valpoi police inspector Sagar Ekoskar said that a worker of Valpoi Municipal Council spotted the foetus inside the vehicle while loading garbage in the truck that was parked at the municipal garden. The worker immediately intimated his in-charge at the municipality about the incident. The in-charge then reported the matter to the Valpoi police. “Police personnel rushed to the spot and conducted the panchanama. The post mortem of the fetus will be conducted on Sunday,” Ekoskar said. Ekoskar also said that an offence has been registered under section 318 of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/male-foetus-found-in-valpoi-waste-van/articleshow/81729232.cms||---

Commercial exploitation of some portion of the space being offered to the operators could be allowed. In fact, the Authority is mulling to offer 25% of the entire area of the e-cycle stations, which could be used for advertising, officials said. With each of the 62 bike stations being planned over 300sqft at prominent locations, the operators could be allowed to use 75 sq ft for publicity purposes. That much space is enough to rake in Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 a month to make the project viable, officials said. The ambitious rent-a-bike facility was supposed to take off a year ago, but no agency has come forward to run the project yet. “Earlier we were offering space to the bike operators, along with some resources and infrastructure,” said SC Mishra, the officer supervising the implementation of the project . “But during discussions with interested agencies in the previous bidding process, viability of the project in the long run was questioned. We have considered the inputs of some entrepreneurs and are thinking of allowing them to use one-fourth portion of the docking station for advertising.” The Authority has already set up half a dozen makeshift stations where the e-cycles will be kept, and will earmark space to set up the remaining ones once the operator is finalised, officials said. The Authority will also provide funds for setting up the project and procuring the e-cycles. However, the agency will have to make arrangements to run the stations, which will have charging facilities. The operator will also have to make arrangements to transport the bikes to the stations, which see higher traffic of office crowd during morning and evening hours, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-may-allow-operators-to-use-25-of-e-cycle-stations-for-ads/articleshow/81729236.cms||Shalabh

Another group is giving out the petals to dry under the sun while a third one is turning them into powder. They can’t spare a minute. Holi is knocking on the door. These group of women, mostly from Loni, are making herbal gulal. On an average, Bansal and his employees make 120kg of gulal from flowers collected from temples and other religious places. Bansal, a builder from Surya Nagar, came up with the idea of making herbal gulal from temple waste during a visit to Shirdi. “It happened a few years ago, while I was on a trip to Shirdi. There, I saw how gulal, incense sticks and other items of religious use are made from waste such as flowers and other items,” he said. After his return, Bansal set up a factory in Mandoli and employed a group of women from Loni and other adjoining areas. The process involves collection of the flower waste, segregating them, drying the petals under the sun and then turning them into powder. “On an average, we collect anything between 100-120kg of religious waste from nearby temples and societies. They are then taken to our factory in Mandoli, where the flowers are segregated,” said Bansal. “We focus on rose petals and marigold. The flowers are dried and placed into grinding machines, where they are pulverized into powder. They are then treated of impurities and dried up again. We mix them with turmeric and sandalwood before packing the final product,” he added. Bansal’s workers are a happy lot. “There are 12 members in our group. We earn anything between Rs 7,000 and Rs 10,000 a month. This has not only given us an employment opportunity, but has also made us financially independent,” said Manju, an employee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/with-herbal-gulal-these-women-are-giving-lessons-on-a-safe-holi/articleshow/81729244.cms||Abhijay Jha

Pal, who lives in Nandigram's Birulia, claimed he had turned down the CM's offer and would work for "Suvendu Adhikari's victory in Nandigram". The alleged conversation triggered a bitter war of words between Trinamool and BJP. TMC, meanwhile, cited an audio clip in which two senior BJP politicians - Mukul Roy and Shishir Bajoria - are purportedly discussing moving the Election Commission to allow any Bengal voter to be a poll agent anywhere in the state. On March 18, the EC had amended its rules, allowing anyone within an assembly segment to be a poll agent within that specific seat. The earlier rule mandated that the poll agent had to be a voter from that booth. Kunal Ghosh, the Trinamool spokesman who released the audio clip in the media on Saturday afternoon, alleged that BJP politicians had influenced the EC to change poll norms. Regarding the audio tape of a voice purported to be the CM's, Bengal minister Subrata Mukherjee first demanded that it be brought out in public. "I would urge the media to frame their questions slightly differently. Where did this ready-made tape come from? When we speak to someone, do we record the conversation? This appears to be planned meticulously. We demand a probe to unearth its origin," he told reporters. "But I am proud that my leader is Mamata Banerjee. If a dedicated party worker leaves the party, what is wrong in calling them in the first place," he said, adding, "Even Indira Gandhi and Priya Ranjan Dasmunshi had called to persuade me." BJP leader Shishir Bajoria, while playing the audio clip at a press meet, said: "If the CM, who is now the caretaker CM, couldn't have entered Nandigram as she told BJP district vice-president Pralay Pal, she doesn't deserve to be the CM. A high-profile person like her is begging for help from a BJP district leader. It gives enough indication of what is going to happen on results day." BJP general secretary and Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya, referring to the alleged phone conversation, said: "Only a candidate who has accepted defeat can speak the way Mamata Banerjee has spoken." BJP's Bengal co-minder, Amit Malviya, too, tweeted claiming "Pishi is definitely losing Nandigram and TMC Bengal". In the tape, the voice BJP says is the CM's is heard saying, "You should help us win Nandigram. Look, I know you have some grievances, but that's due mostly to the Adhikaris who never allowed me to get into Nandigram or East Midnapore. I will take care of everything henceforth." To this, Pal admits he replied, "Didi, you called me, and I am honoured. But I can't betray the Adhikaris as they have stood by me through thick and thin." Pal, who was initially with Congress and joined Trinamool later, had defected to BJP much before Suvendu Adhikari. Pal is among the party's senior politicians in Nandigram. Pal's home in Birulia is also Suvendu's election office. "There is a difference between dedicated party workers who leave, and traitors. Even assuming that the clip is true, it speaks volumes about our party leader who is ready to reach out to the workers who toil for the party. This is quite natural in politics," TMC state spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/tape-war-bjp-makes-public-didi-phone-call/articleshow/81730634.cms||Suman Mondal

They were also told to increase fines for Covid-inappropriate behaviour. The districts have been given a 5-pronged strategy: exponentially raise testing, ensure effective contact tracing, implement Covidappropriate behaviour, boost vaccination and strengthen health infrastructure. Centre wants 30 contacts traced for every Covid-positive patientThe officials were among 46 district representatives from across India present at the meeting held by the Union health ministry to discuss ways to combat the second Covid wave. The Centre expressed displeasure over the spike in cases in some districts in the state, which has seen over 5 lakh new cases this month. The central team is learnt to have expressed concern about Nagpur, Pune and Aurangabad and held detailed discussions on these districts through video-conferencing. Stress was laid on ensuring treatment of patients at Covid care centres for better monitoring. “They stressed on having an effective method of contact tracing. For every positive patient, the Centre has set a target of tracing 30 contacts. They should be traced, tested and isolated in 72 hours,” a district collector who attended the video-conference said. The central team said that studies had shown that while 90% of the people were aware about the importance of face masks, only 44% wore these. “One infected person could spread Covid-19 to an average of 406 other individuals in a 30-day window period,” the collector said. “This could be reduced to 15 by decreasing physical exposure to 50% and to a further 2.5 on average by decreasing physical exposure to 75%.” In a related development, the Centre declined to share results of the genome sequencing of 100 swab samples from Nagpur district, said sources in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation. The Centre also reportedly stated that there was no need for different standard operating procedures (SOPs) to contain the double mutant variant of the virus. It directed the Nagpur Municipal Corporation and district administration to implement year-old SOPs in an effective manner. The state task force too gave a slew of suggestions to contain the second wave, from closure of public places like Juhu beach to a limited lockdown in Mumbai. One member suggested reducing train services to discourage travel for any reason apart from work or medical causes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/centres-5-step-strategy-to-curb-surge-in-maharashtra-districts/articleshow/81730661.cms||---

The central team said that studies had shown that while 90% of the people were aware about the importance of face masks, only 44% wore these. “One infected person could spread Covid-19 to an average of 406 other individuals in a 30-day window period,” the collector said. “This could be reduced to 15 by decreasing physical exposure to 50% and to a further 2.5 on average by decreasing physical exposure to 75%.” In a related development, the Centre declined to share results of the genome sequencing of 100 swab samples from Nagpur district, said sources in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation. The Centre also reportedly stated that there was no need for different standard operating procedures (SOPs) to contain the double mutant variant of the virus. It directed the Nagpur Municipal Corporation and district administration to implement year-old SOPs in an effective manner. The state task force too gave a slew of suggestions to contain the second wave, from closure of public places like Juhu beach to a limited lockdown in Mumbai. One member suggested reducing train services to discourage travel for any reason apart from work or medical causes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/centres-5-step-strategy-to-curb-surge-in-maharashtra-districts/articleshow/81730660.cms||---

The district’s target was 93,480 for March. With only four days for the month to end, Ghaziabad has managed to meet 75% of its target. Officials said that for the next phase, they would set up 78 sub-centres in 28 primary health centres so that more people can be brought under the vaccine coverage. “According to the state government’s directive, we have been given a target to vaccinate 2,16,000 people in April. The minimum achievement for the major days (Monday, Thursday and Friday) is 14,000 while that for the minor days (Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday) is 4,000,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, the district magistrate. “The weekly target has been set at 54,000 and we hope to achieve it by upgrading our centres,” he added. Vaccination will be carried out across 28 public health centres and 25 private facilities. “In March, the target for Ghaziabad was 93,480, of which, we have managed to cover 75% till Saturday. But to meet the April target, we plan to activate 78 sub-centres under 28 primary health centres. About 30 of the sub-centres will be activated on April 1 itself while the remaining will be done according to the flow of recipients,” Pandey said. Meanwhile, a total of 2,207 people were administered vaccines at 35 private and government centres on Saturday. While 904 were vaccinated at 11 government centres, 1,303 took the jab at 24 private facilities. A total of 1,481 recipients were under the 60-plus category while 503 people were aged between 45-49 years and had comorbidities. In Noida, close to 2,000 people were vaccinated on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/2-1l-target-set-for-gzb-in-next-round/articleshow/81730708.cms||---

Modi also went to the Jashoreshwari Kali temple at Ishwaripur before arriving in Orakandi, reports Rohit Khanna. The PM's visit came weeks ahead of elections to the 10 assembly seats in North 24 Parganas and Nadia, where the Matuas decide political fortunes. "Today my emotions are similar to what the thousands of my Matua sampraday (community) siblings in India feel when they come to Orakandi," Modi said on Saturday. Who thought that the Prime Minister of India would come to Orakandi some day?" Modi said addressing an audience after offering prayers at the Matua guru Purnabrahma Harichand Thakur temple. Modi is the first Indian PM to reach out to the seat of the Matua community. BJP MP from Bongaon Shantanu Thakur, a descendant of the Matua gurus Harichand-Guruchand, accompanied him. "During my 2015 visit to Bangladesh, I had expressed my wish to visit Orakandi, and today my wish came true," said Modi, who began his speech with "Jai Hari bol", the popular greeting of the Matua sect. The PM offered to set up a primary school at Orakandi and to upgrade the existing middle school for girls there. Promising that India would make efforts to make the pilgrimage to Orakandi easier for people from India, Modi said, "This is a pilgrimage of the bond between the people of India and Bangladesh... People from India visit Orakandi each year and we will take measures to facilitate the pilgrimage." Modi quoted from the Matua poet Mahananda Halder's book, "Sri Sri Guruchand Charit", and claimed that the Matua gurus had "divyadrishti" and "alaukik shakti (divine power to see the future)". "Whatever have been achieved by the Scheduled Castes are the fruits of a wish-yielding tree like Harichand Thakur," the PM said. Modi recounted his association and the warmth he received from the Matua leaders of West Bengal at the Matua headquarters at Thakurnagar, North 24 Parganas. "I remember visiting Thakurnagar where they welcomed me like a member of the family. Baroma's (late Matua matriarch Binapani Devi) blessings and her affection remained precious moments of my life," Modi said. The PM, emphasising the Indo-Bangladesh bond, said: "We are committed to organising big events and various functions reflecting the glorious history of the Matua sect."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/bengal-elections-2021-eye-on-matuas-modi-at-bangladesh-shrine/articleshow/81730709.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Ranchi||In Madhupur, BJP hopes for a rerun of 2009 Tamar bypoll verdict||RANCHI: Ahead of the Madhupur bypoll on April 17, the coalition government of JMM-Congress-RJD appeared confident of clinching the seat and it is banking upon its candidate Hafizul Hassan’s status as a minister to steer it towards victory. Speaking to TOI on Saturday from Santhal Pargana, a JMM leader preferring anonymity said, “Our candidate being a minister will give the party an edge in the bypoll. Voters have a clear choice to choose between a minister and an MLA. Moreover, there is a sympathy wave prevalent in Madhupur for Haji and his son Hafizul and that will work in our favour.” In the 2019 assembly polls, JMM’s veteran leader Haji Hussain Ansari clinched the Madhupur seat by a margin of 23,069 votes by defeating BJP’s Raj Paliwar. He was inducted into the cabinet as the minister for minority welfare. But in October last year, he died of post-Covid complications. In February, chief minister and JMM working president Hemant Soren inducted Haji’s elder son Hafizul into his cabinet and gave him portfolios like minority affairs, tourism, sports, art and culture and youth affairs. Hafizul’s induction was also an attempt by JMM to quash any opportunity by its alliance partners to stake their claims on the seat. The Madhupur bypoll will be Hassan’s debut in electoral politics. A few days ago, while speaking to reporters in Project Building, Hemant had said, “We don’t have any doubts regarding Madhupur. The results will be in our favour. It will be a repeat of 2019.” BJP’s leader of legislative party Babulal Marandi, on the other hand, was quick to point out that a ministerial berth doesn’t ensure anyone’s victory in an election. “If that was the case, then Shibu Soren, who was a sitting CM in 2009, shouldn’t have lost to Raja Peter, who contested from Jharkhand Party in the Tamar bypoll and gave Guru-Ji a crushing defeat,” he said. The saffron party has fielded Ganga Narayan Singh, an Ajsu Party turncoat, and denied a ticket to two-time Madhupur MLA Raj Paliwar. The party decided to go for Singh after he proved his mettle by bagging about 45,000 votes in the 2019 assembly polls on an Ajsu Party ticket even though he had finished on the third spot. “Despite Ajsu Party not having any considerable in Madhupur, its candidate Singh went on to clinch the third spot by bagging a decent number of votes, which ultimately spoilt BJP’s chances as both the parties had fought separately. We thought of fielding a fresh face who has his own support base and coupled with BJP’s resources, we can give a tough fight to the grand alliance candidate. Paliwar may have been a two-time MLA, however, he doesn’t enjoy enough mass base and it was BJP’s election strategies and resources which had helped him win the seat in the past,” a BJP leader said. He added that this time Singh’s support base, coupled with BJP’s resources, can give tough fight to mahagathbandhan candidate. The results of the bypoll will be declared on May 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/in-madhupur-bjp-hopes-for-a-rerun-of-2009-tamar-bypoll-verdict/articleshow/81728120.cms||ASRP Mukesh

On Saturday, Gadkari wrote to Union minister for tribal affairs Arjun Munda, asking him to be a part of the virtual ceremony on April 3. Speaking to TOI on the issue, National Highways Authority of India’s regional officer S K Mishra said, “Gadkari will inaugurate around seven projects and lay the foundation stone of 14. Two projects had to be dropped as they were falling under the Madhupur constituency and currently, the model code of conduct is in force there.” The road projects that will be inaugurated are worth Rs 2,536 crore and they cover an area of 277km. The projects include the strengthening of the 27-km-stretch along the Ghagra-Gumla road on NH-143A, the 71 km-long Mahulia-Bahragora highway along the Jharkhand-Bengal border, 34km-long four-lane from Kutchery Chowk in Ranchi via Piska More-Bijupara section and the 41.28km-stretch from Barhi to Hazaribagh four-lane. “A part of the Kutchery-Bijupara four-lane passes through the city and work on that stretch is pending but work on the remaining patches is already over. The pending section will be done by the authorities concerned soon as it falls beyond the jurisdiction of national highways,” Mishra said. The projects whose foundation stones will be laid are worth Rs 859 crore and they cover an area of 293km and they comprise strengthening of existing roads and construction of two bridges. “The projects will strengthen the existing road network in Jharkhand and ensure seamless transport for a boost in trade and commerce,” an official in the state road construction department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/gadkari-to-inaugurate-projects-worth-over-rs-2000-crore-on-april-3/articleshow/81728094.cms||ASRP Mukesh

A worker with Childline in Hazaribag, Sweety Kumari, along with other neighbours, rescued the girls from their tormentor’s house after hearing their cries. “The girls were severely bleeding,” she said. The two minors used to work at the residence of Asha Choudhury in Baba Path-1 of Hurhuru Mohalla. Sources said her husband, late Ram Lakhan Choudhary, was an additional district magistrate. Hazaribag SP Karthik S said they have taken cognizance of the incident and initiated a probe. He said, “Officials of Childline and district social welfare department are currently probing the matter. Once they submit the report, we will take formal complaint and action shall follow.” The incident occurred under Barabazar police station. “I have also instructed officer in-charge Yogendra Mishra to provide proper protection to the injured kids,” he added. “The victims were illegally confined in the house for domestic works. Once they recover, they will be produced before the child welfare committee,” Karthik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/minors-working-as-maids-thrashed-by-employer-rescued-in-hbag/articleshow/81728107.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal polls: Fierce fight over Adkhikari turf sets tone for Nandigram showdown||CONTAI/KHEJURI (EAST MIDNAPORE): The first of the eight phases of polling in Bengal ended on Saturday with over 80% votes being cast across 30 assembly seats. The spotlight, however, remained firmly on East Midnapore’s seven seats, where the Trinamool Congress and the Adhikari family were fighting an election on different sides for the first time. Suvendu Adhikari’s brother Soumendu’s car was attacked at Sabajput barely 8km from the family’s Shanti Kunj home in Contai Town after a heated exchange with Trinamool workers around 11am. No one was seriously injured in the skirmish but it reflected the bitterness between friends-turned-foes in East Midnapore as well as the bitterness that has characterised the fight between the Trinamool and the BJP here and in the rest of Bengal. There were a few other stray incidents — crude bombs hurled in Pataspur to intimidate voters and voting being suspended at Majhna, around 4km from Contai Town, for an hour following allegations of malfunctioning EVMs — and complaints and counter-complaints lodged with the Election Commission over polling in East Midnapore, which is hosting this election’s most intriguing sub-plot. But the stray violence did not deter women voters — particularly Muslims — from coming out in large numbers and pushing the polling percentage to above 80%, something that Trinamool and BJP polling agents noted with contrasting emotions. Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee is the Trinamool candidate from Nandigram, which goes to vote on April 1 and Adhikari scion Suvendu — the BJP’s biggest poll-season acquisition — will be her principal opponent. His brother, former Contai Municipality chairman and Contai (South) BJP candidate Arup Kumar Das’s election agent, Soumendu, was doing the rounds of booths when his vehicle was attacked at the entrance to a polling station in Sabajput around 11am. Trinamool workers led by former Sabajput panchayat pradhan Ramgobinda Das attacked his vehicle with bricks, smashed windshields and door panes and injured his driver Ram Singh, Soumendu alleged. Das did not deny the attack but said it was “a spontaneous public reaction” to his being roughed up by Soumendu’s men when he objected to their entering the polling station. Voting stopped for some time but resumed after central forces arrived in huge numbers. Trinamool candidate Jyotimoy Kar, too, reached the spot. “I heard there was trouble. But I want voting to resume,” he said. Neither Soumendu nor father Sisir sought to make much of the attack. “Votes will speak, the lotus will bloom,” Sisir said when he stepped out to vote at 2 p.m. He cast his ballot at Prabhat Kumar College polling station just behind his Shanti Kunj residence. The Adhikari patriarch’s brother-in-law and three-time Ramnagar Trinamool MLA Akhil Giri monitored polling from the party office around 25 km away in Ramnagar. He came to Contai to cast his vote around 7.30 a.m. Khejuri and Pataspur, which played a key role in the 2007 farmland stir that culminated in the Nandigram police firing that claimed 14 lives, witnessed stray violence on Saturday. Crude bombs were hurled to intimidate voters in the early hours and a police officer and a central force personnel were injured. But it failed to dampen voter interest. And, if the number of red flags in Khejuri was any indication, the Left Front appeared to be in a fight in some pockets. But the strong turnout notwithstanding, the exuberance visible in 2011 — when people showed the Left the door — was missing conspicuously on Saturday. The change of loyalty this time — either away from the Adhikaris or their former party — would be less spontaneous and more well thought out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/day-1-fierce-fight-over-adkhikari-turf-sets-tone-for-nandigram-showdown/articleshow/81729217.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Even the students and their parents are hesitant to attend in-person classes as “no amount sanitisation can guarantee that they won’t be infected in the current Covid scenario”. Kairali Public School’s vice-principal Suja Pillai said, “Earlier, we had informed the students and their parents that offline classes from class VIII onwards will begin from April 5 but now I am not sure if we can do that now given the current Covid situation. We are awaiting directives from the government before taking a call on the matter.” She added, “There is risk involved if the students and staff are called for physical classes. The online classes should continue in the current situation for at least two more months.” Jawahar Vidya Mandir (JVM), Shyamli is going to consult the teachers on whether to go for offline classes. School principal Samarjit Jana said, “We will hold a meeting with the teachers and other stakeholders on April 1 on the issue. No matter how much of a strict vigil we maintain and see to it that the students are wearing masks, sanitising their hands and maintaining social distancing, it is likely that many of them will come in close contact with others.” A JVM teacher on condition of anonymity said, “Many parents have come forward with the request to postpone offline classes for at least two months and the school administration has been forced to rethink its earlier decision.” Usha Shankar, whose daughter Harsha Priyam studies in class XI in JVM, said, “We are not comfortable with sending our children to school under the prevailing condition. There are instances of students getting infected after attending offline classes. Our worries would have been less had the kids been vaccinated.” Priyam, however, said that students of classes XI and XII should be called for offline classes after putting in place strict Covid norms. She added, “Offline classes are essential for senior students for better understanding of a subject.” Another JVM student Ayush Raj said, “Offline classes would have been reasonable had the new Covid cases in Jharkhand been less than 100 per day and less than 20,000 countrywide. Under the prevailing situation, offline classes will not be safe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/amid-surge-in-cases-schools-to-rethink-on-offline-classes-for-new-session/articleshow/81728128.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||University of Hyderabad study finds how malaria bug tricks body||HYDERABAD: A team from the University of Hyderabad (UoH) has decoded how the malarial parasite avoids the immune system in humans to thrive by modifying one of its proteins. The significant discovery would help in the development of new drugs to treat malaria, which has already become resistant to several existing drugs, the researchers say. The UoH team found that the malarial parasite, Plasmodium, behaves differently in the human body in the presence and absence of fever. This adaptability helps it escape the immune system and thrive. One of the proteins identified as falciparum erythrocyte-membrane-protein 1 (PfEMP1) is presented by parasite in 90 different ways, but it uses only one variant at a time, so that body fails to recognise and develop immunity. The UoH team led by Prof Mrinal Bhattacharya found a correlation between the fever induced by malaria and antigenic variation of malarial parasites. PfEMP1 protein is the most predominant molecular determinant of antigenic variation in malarial parasite. There could be up to 90 variants of this protein and only one protein is expressed at a time, and this is random. Researchers said protein variants do not live through multiple generations as malaria parasites keep changing from one protein form to other, hence human host fails to mount a robust antibody response against variant proteins. "The study uncovered how parasites manipulate expression of malarial proteins on surface of infected red blood cells in response to fever. We found exposure to febrile temperature modulates expression of virulence genes that could impact chronicity of infection," researchers said. Targeting parasitic proteins in heat-shock response during fever is likely to restrict antigenic variation in parasites and prevent malaria. Study was published in journal, Molecular Microbiology. Others in team are Wahida Tabassum, Dr Shalu Varunan. Dr Sunanda Bhattacharyya of department of biotechnology and bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, UoH, collaborated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/university-of-hyderabad-study-finds-how-malaria-bug-tricks-body/articleshow/81730731.cms||Syed Akbar

The online news site Myanmar Now reported late Saturday that the death toll had reached 114. A count issued by an independent researcher in Yangon who has been compiling near-real time death tolls put the total at 107, spread over more than two dozen cities and towns. Both numbers are higher than all estimates for the previous high on March 14, which ranged in counts from 74 to 90. Figures collected by the researcher, who asked not to be named for his security, have generally tallied with the counts issued at the end of each day by the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners, which documents deaths and arrests and is widely seen as a definitive source. The Associated Press is unable to independently confirm the death tolls. The killings quickly drew international condemnation, with multiple diplomatic missions to Myanmar releasing statements that mentioned the killing of civilians Saturday, including children. “This 76th Myanmar armed forces day will stay engraved as a day of terror and dishonour,” the European Union's delegation to Myanmar said on Twitter. “The killing of unarmed civilians, including children, are indefensible acts." In the United States, Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned the violence. “We are horrified by the bloodshed perpetrated by Burmese security forces, showing that the junta will sacrifice the lives of the people to serve the few,” he said in a tweet. “I send my deepest condolences to the victims' families. The courageous people of Burma reject the military's reign of terror.” The death toll in Myanmar has been steadily rising as authorities grow more forceful with their suppression of opposition to the February 1 coup that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. The coup reversed years of progress toward democracy after five decades of military rule. Up through Friday, the Association of Political Prisoners had verified 328 people killed in the post-coup crackdown. Junta chief Senior Gen Min Aung Hlaing did not directly refer to the protest movement when he gave his nationally televised Armed Forces Day speech before thousands of soldiers in Naypyitaw. He referred only to “terrorism which can be harmful to state tranquility and social security,” and called it unacceptable. This year's event was seen as a flashpoint for violence, with demonstrators threatening to double down on their public opposition to the coup with more and bigger demonstrations. The protesters refer to the holiday by its original name, Resistance Day, which marks the beginning of a revolt against Japanese occupation in World War 2. State television MRTV on Friday night showed an announcement urging young people — who have been at the forefront of the protests and prominent among the casualties — to learn a lesson from those killed during demonstrations about the danger of being shot in the head or back. The warning was widely taken as a threat because a great number of the fatalities among protesters have come from being shot in the head, suggesting they have been targeted for death. The announcement suggested that some young people were taking part in protesting as if it was a game, and urged their parents and friends to talk them out of participating. In recent days the junta has portrayed the demonstrators as the ones perpetrating violence for their sporadic use of Molotov cocktails. On Saturday, some protesters in Yangon were seen carrying bows and arrows. In contrast, security forces have used live ammunition for weeks against what have still been overwhelmingly unarmed and peaceful crowds. The US Embassy said shots were fired Saturday at its cultural center in Yangon, though no one was injured. The military government does not issue regular casualty counts, and when it has released figures, the totals have been a fraction of what independent parties such as the UN have reported. It has said its use of force has been justified to stop what it has called rioting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/myanmar-forces-kill-over-100-in-deadliest-day-since-coup/articleshow/81730933.cms||---

The overall tally reached 6,12,372 of which 5,96,953 have recovered. The number of active infections, however, increased by 11.6% in the past 24 hours -- from 5,842 on Friday to 6,615 on Saturday. Cases of active infection are an indicator of the present extent of the pandemic, doctors said. The official bulletin revealed that while cases in Lucknow declined compared to the previous day, but Varanasi and Prayagraj recorded more than 40 new cases in the past 24 hours. Spikes have been recorded in remote districts too. In Balrampur for instance, 33 new cases have been reported in the past two days. Likewise, 41 cases have been recorded in Rae Bareli and 39 cases have been recorded in Unnao in the past 48 hours. Experts called for strict adherence to the Covid-19 prevention protocol. “The surge should not be seen as mere festive rush induced pattern. If care is not taken now, the situation will slip out of hands,” said an epidemiologist in a government medical institution. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has instructed officials to boost testing in the state and ensure that no less than 1.5 lakh tests are conducted per day. The chief minister has also issued directions to ensure that adequate health infrastructure is available to attend to the patients. As on date, 3,600 of the 6,615 persons are under home isolation while others are under treatment at private or government hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/active-covid-cases-rise-by-11-6-in-up-in-24-hours/articleshow/81730941.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Deathtrap crater at Nilgiri crossing after road caves in||LUCKNOW: Commuters had a tough time after a huge crater – big enough for two hatchback cars – was formed on busy Nilgiri crossing in Indiranagar following a road cave-in during the laying of telecom cables. Residents said the road gave way around 1.30pm on Friday after a heavily loaded tractor passed by the crossing. “Cracks developed on the road and as the upper crest crumbled, a huge crater was formed. It appeared as if there was an earthquake,” said Rishi Kumar, a resident. People informed Lucknow Municipal Corporation officials after which a team of Jal Sansthan was sent to the spot and the area was barricaded. The road leading from Nilgiri crossing to Lekhraj was closed for traffic. Movement on half of the main road remained affected due to which traffic crawled throughout all day. Last month, a similar incident had taken place at Shivajipuram in Indiranagar. “The crater is 49ft long, 19.6ft wide and 7ft deep. Use of substandard material to repair the road after laying telecom cables has led to the incident. We have lodged an FIR against the contractor hired by the telecom company for the job,” said Jal Sansthan executive engineer BK Srivastava. “It will take about three days to repair the road and restore traffic movement,” he added. Locals demanded a thorough probe and strict action against those responsible for shoddy work. “It does not appear to be handiwork of a private contractor alone. It seems that some sewage or water pipeline leakage washed away the soil creating a vacuum under the road. We don’t know whether this happened due to digging for laying of cables or pipelines are of poor quality. A detailed inquiry is required to bring the truth out,” said Dr Prithi Shukla, a resident. Tanay Chandwani, a commuter, said: “A major accident could have taken place. Due to festival season, traffic on the route has already increased and with the stretch out of bounds for public use, we are facing traffic snarls in and around Lekhraj market.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-deathtrap-crater-at-nilgiri-crossing-after-road-caves-in/articleshow/81730948.cms||Pranchal Srivastava
---||Lucknow||Innovations click: Virtual world, rooftops become stage for artists||LUCKNOW: After remaining subdued during lockdown, and for several months thereafter, the cultural and performing arts segment in the city has transformed itself into hybrid mode. Initially, a number of events like parties, cultural festivals, theatre plays, concerts and literary festivals were held online but now they are available both in off-line and online mode. Some have also come up with innovations like rooftop theatre. With face masks and gloves on and hand sanitizers on the set, Bhartendu Natya Akademi organised the city’s first online theatre fest ‘Rang Jharokha’ in July, followed by other virtual workshops. “Our aim was to engage the audience, spread positivity and continue working during lockdown. We maintained distance, sanitized the auditorium and equipment all the time whenever someone touched or used it. Unlike other plays, the artists did not wear costumes and came in their own attire, wore masks and used sanitizers. The whole way of doing things changed for us,” said Ramesh Gupta, former director of BNA, who held the office till the second week of March. “While we had a live virtual theatre fest, we made sure that we also record plays and then our social media team uploaded them daily on our official website and Youtube channel. We engaged writers, directors and playwrights for virtual conversation which also became a hit among our audience. We started having online classes earlier and post-lockdown we have classes in two batches,” he added. Adapting to new digital ways, UP Sangeet Natak Akademi (UPSNA) has been organising both online and offline events even after lockdown. The Akademi began with live telecasts of studio recordings, organising Kathak workshops via Zoom calls between the teachers and students, virtual plays and performances. “We didn’t do many studio recordings earlier since all the events were organised with live audiences. Similar was the case with other events. Only teachers and those organising workshops used to be present in one room. Since the digital format gained momentum, we started including it in our daily routine and even after a year we have decided to conduct both online and offline events,” said UPSNA secretary Tarun Raj, adding that art and culture always find audience. Apart from cultural and literary festivals going online, city-based artists too utilised their time and started performing ‘live’ from their room. Bharatanatyam dancer Syed Shamshur Rehman organised many facebook lives from his home to cater to a wider audience and his students. Former director of BNA and theatre director Arun Trivedi began with 'Rooftop Theatre' at his home. With the students of his city-based theatre institute, Trivedi started staging plays on the terrace of his house. “The purpose of staging plays as rooftop open air theatre was to maintain social distancing which cannot be managed in an auditorium or any other closed area. We only invited 20-25 guests. The concept was a hit. I’ll be staging the next play on occasion of World Theatre Day on March 27,” Arun added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/innovations-click-virtual-world-rooftops-become-stage-for-artists/articleshow/81730959.cms||Aditi Singh

In the past 10 days, the state recorded 17,423 new Covid cases. The figure is 33% of the total of 53,558 cases recorded in the state in 2021 till March 27. Ahmedabad and Surat cities alone accounted for 53% of the total cases in the past 10 days, making them epicentres of the pandemic. In the past 10 days, the daily positive cases doubled from 1,122 on March 17 to 2,276 on March 27. The cities also doubled their daily tallies – in Ahmedabad, the daily cases rose from 264 to 601 whereas in Surat, the figures were 315 and 607 on March 17 and March 27, respectively. P 2 48% occupancyDr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA) said that the bed occupancy in private hospitals of Ahmedabad is at 48% with 1,415 patients. “Daily, we are witnessing the addition of about 100 patients. Moreover, the number of patients requiring home care is double of that number. We have already asked the member hospitals to increase the beds,” he said. Experts have attributed the surge – Gujarat is recording 2,000-plus daily cases for the past two days – to the change in virus profile where the spread is very fast but the severity is less.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/33-of-gujarats-covid-19-cases-this-year-in-past-10-days/articleshow/81730962.cms||Parth Shastri
---||World||China, with $400 billion Iran deal, could deepen influence in W Asia||China agreed to invest $400 billion in Iran over 25 years in exchange for a steady supply of oil to fuel its growing economy under a sweeping economic and security agreement signed on Saturday. The deal could deepen China's influence in the West Asia and undercut US' efforts to keep Iran isolated. But it was not immediately clear how much of the deal can be implemented while the international dispute over Iran's nuclear programme remains unresolved. President Joe Biden has offered to resume negotiations with Iran over the 2015 nuclear deal that President Trump abrogated three years after it was signed. But he says Iran must first commit to adhering to the terms of the deal. Iran has refused to do so, and China has backed it up. The foreign ministers of the two countries, Javad Zarif and Wang Yi, signed the agreement during a ceremony at the foreign ministry in Tehran on Saturday, according to Iran's semiofficial Fars News Agency. The deal marked the first time Iran has signed such a lengthy agreement with a major world power. In 2001, Iran and Russia singed a 10-year cooperation agreement, mainly in the nuclear field, that was lengthened to 20 years through two five-year extensions. Before the ceremony, Wang met Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Iran's foreign spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh called the deal "deep, multi-layer and full-fledged". Iran did not make the details of the agreement public before the signing. But experts said it was largely unchanged from an 18-page draft obtained last year by NYT. That draft detailed $400 billion of Chinese investments to be made in dozens of fields, including banking, telecom, ports, railways, health and information technology, over the next 25 years. In exchange, China would receive a regular - and, according to an Iranian official, heavily discounted - supply of Iran oil. The draft also called for deepening military cooperation, including joint training and exercises, joint research and weapons development and intel-sharing.

Members of the K9 squad attached to Gujarat police may soon be required to spruce up their appraisal reports for ranks, rewards, and remuneration (3R). The Gujarat police currently have 200 dogs. After introducing various training modules, police officers and dog training assistants are now moving a proposal to introduce ranks and rewards for dogs in the K9 squad. As of now, some paramilitary forces and police of Kerala and Punjab have assigned ranks to dogs of the canine squad. Both DGP Vikas Sahay and senior canine training consultant Colonel Chandan Singh Rathore confirmed the development to TOI during a demonstration of the dog squad at the SRP headquarters in Saijpur Bogha area. However, they refused to elaborate further. A Gujarat police officer said, “We have decided to move a proposal to the home department to give ranks and rewards to dogs who have been serving with cops. This will also help in motivating dog handlers and give recognition to canine squad which has been trained to bust cases related to narcotics, explosives and terrorism,” said a Gujarat police officer. The squad includes a beagle, Labradors, German shepherds, Doberman pinschers, and Belgian malinois. Apart from this, the dogs, who used to get artificial packaged food, will now get cooked non-vegetarian food. Dr Apoorva Gohil, a veterinary doctor appointed for the canine health care facility, said that the dogs will be given mutton, chicken, chapati, and milk. “They could not escalate their energy and sustain stamina with artificial food. So, we have decided to give them cooked food measuring around 300 grams for a dog weighing around 30 kg. This will be increased with proportion to their weight,” said Gohil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarats-k9-squad-to-get-pawsitive-reinforcement/articleshow/81730981.cms||Ashish Chauhan

The resident of Basant Vihar said Sumit Kumar of Dharampur Colony, Pinjore, reached the first floor of their house around 8.30pm and started screaming that he will burn himself and others too. After setting himself on fire, he hugged the grandfather of the woman. The woman’s mother saved him with the help of a wooden stick. The old man received burn injuries on his hands. In the meantime, other family members called the cops. A PCR vehicle took Kumar to a nearby hospital, from where he was referred to the Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32 considering his serious burn injuries. The woman said, “It was a scary moment for all of us. He could have killed anybody. My younger sister is still in panic. The police must take strict action against him.” According to family members, the accused had entered their house on February 12 too, in a drunken state and created drama to marry their daughter. A police complaint in this regard was also given. Later, the accused and his family apologised. Police registered a case against Kumar under Sections 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 309 (attempt to commit suicide) and 307 (punishment for attempt to murder) of the IPC at Kalka police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-rejected-for-marriage-man-on-fire-tries-to-hug-womans-kin/articleshow/81730998.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

In the advertisement, the woman sought an alliance from any healthy man older than her, and mandatorily a Brahmin, of her community. She said she is leading a lonely life and looking for a “jeevana sangati”. The advertisementShe told STOI: “I don’t have a family of my own. My parents are no more. My first marriage ended in divorce. I fear staying alone. Thoughts that I may fall at home and fail to get help, or fear of walking home from the bus stop have led me to look for a life partner.” She said her marriage and divorce was painful and the hurt prevented her from contemplating marriage all these years. More than a marriage and spouse in the traditional sense, she added, what she needs now is a “companion for the rest of my life” who will stay with her. The advertisement, widely shared on social media, drew applause from youths who said her decision would break cultural stereotypes in society. Activist Roopa Hassan said the woman most likely fears loneliness and has chosen to look for a partner, having led an independent life so far. “She should be very careful in her decision. Else, criminals may take advantage of it,” she said. Raveesh BN, a psychiatry professor, said the ad should be an eye-opener for society where the elderly are often neglected, and loneliness becomes a factor with increasing age. “Today, there is no joint family. The mental health of people is deteriorating and causing issues,” he said.

Speaking to media persons after giving their statement to the Special Investigation Team (SIT), the father of the woman, an ex-serviceman, and her two brothers alleged that Shivakumar had "used" the situation to his benefit. The developments come as an embarrassment to the Congress, which has been campaigning vociferously, demanding Ramesh Jarkiholi's arrest and a high court-monitored probe into the scandal. "It is Shivakumar who released the CD. He is the mastermind," one of the woman's brothers alleged, saying he had sent her to Goa. "We just want our daughter back," her father said. Role of ‘mahanayaka’ behind scandal has come out: JarkiholiWe have an audio clipping of a phone call with my sister and the same has been shared with SIT officials. My sister told me that she is at Shivakumar’s house and he is sending her to Goa safely. Making such videos, supporting a woman to take political revenge is not the right thing,” the brother said. Her father added, “Using a scheduled tribe woman for his (DKS) political gain is dirty politics. We don’t expect anything.” An hour later, the woman released yet another audio recording in which she accused Ramesh Jarkiholi of threatening and blackmailing her parents into issuing statements against Shivakumar. “They don’t know what has happened to me. They are being blackmailed. They were tutored to tell media what they said. I am scared to come out,” she said in the clip, requesting CM BS Yediyurappa, opposition leader Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar to help her record her statement before a judge. Earlier, Ramesh Jarkiholi said Shivakumar is the “producer’’ of the CD. He said the role of the “mahanayaka” behind the scandal has finally come out in the open. “I have 11 pieces of evidence about his involvement. I will file a police case against him. He has used an innocent woman to play politics. The statement of the parents have vindicated my stand. Shivakumar is unfit to be in politics,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dk-shivakumar-released-sex-cd-sent-woman-to-goa-allege-her-kin/articleshow/81731050.cms||---

An effort is being made to shield the accused, the court observed. “We find the affidavit of the DGP to be completely unacceptable. It defies reason as to how an accused who is the spouse of a sitting MLA has not been arrested despite being arraigned in pursuance of the provisions of Section 319 CrPC to face trial for an offence under IPC section 302,” Justice D Y Chandrachud said on Friday.

Apart from saying prayers and reading condolence messages, they went a step further to touch the lives of many — all of them donated blood in a mass camp in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis. The heart-warming gesture unfolded at a playground in Rajankunte. Apart from a friendly cricket match organised on the occasion, the members donated blood along the boundary line. They had all come together in memory of Amratlalji Dager, who was just 32 when he died in a road accident in the city on March 19, 2020. He was run over by a lorry, which was being driven by an inebriated man. Vinod Choudhary, a 24-year-old businessman from Peenya, said: “He was a key member of our community and his passing away was a big loss for all. This year, for his first death anniversary, we decided to do something in his memory through which others could also benefit. So we came up with the idea of a blood donation camp.” Choudhary, who thought of the idea only three days prior to the anniversary, managed to pull it off by convincing Dager’s family and others in the community about the importance of blood donation, especially during the pandemic. Choudhary contacted Alphonse Kurian, chairperson of blood donation committee of the Lions Club of Bangalore, Sanjaynagar. “Vinod is a regular donor and his request for a mass blood donation drive was pleasantly surprising,” added Kurian, who soon connected with the Kidwai blood bank and preparations were made at the playground. Held alongside cricket matchOn the morning of March 19, there was some confusion on how to go ahead with the family cricket match and the blood donation camp simultaneously. “But Dager’s family members and relatives made it all easy. The camp was organised alongside the cricket match,” said Choudhary. The day saw collection of 60 units of blood. “In my many years of experience, I have never seen so many people from one community come together to donate blood to mark the first death anniversary of a loved one,” added the Lions Club member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/60-donate-blood-to-mark-accident-victims-1st-death-anniversary/articleshow/81731086.cms||Petlee Peter

This was the city’s second lowest turnout under the third phase so far. Vaccinations took place at 56 session sites. Officials from the health department said no inoculation drive will be held in the city for the next two days. The department will hold a mega vaccination drive on March 30 (Tuesday) in which they plan to vaccinate at least 10,000 people. Of the vaccinations under Phase 3 on Saturday, 761 people were senior citizens and while 385 were above the age of 45 years with comorbidities. A total of 254 healthcare workers and 230 frontline workers also took the jab. “One of the reasons behind the low turnout is the festive season. Moreover, the response has been lukewarm at private health facilities,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. Gurugram chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav said. “The decision to not conduct the vaccination drive on Holi comes on directions from the state government. The government has decided to conduct a mega drive on Tuesday.” Meanwhile, the city reported 245 new Covid cases on Saturday, taking the total tally of cases to 61,972. One more person succumbed to the infection, taking the toll to 364. The number of active cases in Gurugram has increased to 1,516.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/over-1100-get-covid-jabs-mega-vaccination-drive-on-tuesday/articleshow/81729134.cms||Vishakha Chaman

The budget, with an outlay of Rs 9,287 crore, was devoid of populist fixes and over-the-top projects that could burden taxpayers of Bengaluru. BBMP administrator Gaurav Gupta said: "The emphasis of the budget is on completing several long-pending projects and ongoing infrastructure works in the city." Presented in the absence of an elected council (comprising corporators), the budget hasn't proposed any hike in taxes (including property and advertisement), cess, rentals collected from several BBMP properties and fees for various services, including khata certificates. BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad, said: "Unlike in the last four years, this budget has been more realistic as it is in sync with BBMP's revenue. New projects were being announced in the past, when there were not enough funds to maintain existing civic amenities. However, this time the budget is more citizen-centric." The Palike hopes to mobilise Rs 3,353 crore from tax revenue, Rs 1,250 crore from non-tax revenue, Rs 421 crore grants from Centre, Rs 3,845 crore grants from state government and Rs 417 crore in the form of library cess, beggary cess and urban land transport cess. Of the Rs 9,287 crore it plans to spend, 49 per cent has been earmarked for development works. Deviating from the past, the budget gives thrust to decentralisation of funds and accountability at the zonal and ward levels. "Administrative decisions involving financial resources to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore will be delegated to the zonal level," said BBMP special commissioner (finance) Thulasi Maddineni, while presenting the budget. This apart, Rs 1,622 crore has been allocated towards solid waste management (SWM). However, a major cause of concern for BBMP pertains to payment of bills for various projects executed by contractors. "We currently have pending bills amounting to Rs 3,000 crore for civic works completed and ongoing works worth Rs 7,000 crore. These intimidating liabilities have pushed us to take difficult decisions," she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-budget-spares-tax-hike-focuses-on-reducing-debts/articleshow/81731097.cms||Kiran Parashar

Health workers were left stunned as Krishnadas Vaishnav walked in, almost on his own steam, to take the vaccine. He is the oldest person in Madhya Pradesh to be vaccinated, said Dr Tarun Gupta, district immunisation officer. The centenarian was cheered as he walked out of the vac centre, supported by a block-level officer, who had visited him personally and taken him for the vaccination. Vaishnav appealed to people to take the vaccine. “There is no Coronavirus cure yet. Vaccination is the only way,” he said. Krishnadas Vaishnav was mahant at Digambar Akhada in Ujjain and still goes for Bhagwat Kathas, which is the family’s traditional profession, said his son Brijmohan. “He has no ailment, has sweets to his heart’s content, and is still full of life.

NIA must step in immediately and search for the DVR. Surprisingly, more than a week after NIA took over the investigation into placing of explosives near the residence of Mukesh Mumbai, it hasn’t recorded statements of any of the seniors of suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Waze,” Sawant said. When contacted, ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh did not respond. The CDR relates to his tenure in office. Leader of opposition and former CM Devendra Fadnavis said “all the godfathers of Waze have been tense ever since the NIA took over the probe.” Sawant said, “We demand that NIA should first probe Param Bir Singh and check if he was aware about the DVR. If NIA is reluctant to probe, the state home department should step in and initiate a probe into the disappearance of the DVR. On March 10, the DVR of the Mumbai CP’s office was officially taken by ATS for investigation, but the CP took the view that it was a mistake to hand over the DVR to ATS. It was then taken back from ATS by a senior official from the CP’s office. It has since been missing.” Sawant alleged that in the DVR, not only Waze but even movements of Scorpio and Innova was clearly seen. “But NIA is yet to summon any of Waze’s senior officials. BJP has stopped demanding a probe against Singh as BJP’s aim is to divert attention from the Antilia case and Mansukh Hiran murder case. The goalposts were changed for political reasons,” he claimed. On the allegations that the DVR was missing, Fadnavis said it has a very strong back-up, so even if it is missing or stolen, no one will be able to destroy the record. “Digital footprint is collected at three places, so if the DVR is missing, the data will still be there,” he said. From Singh’s letter, Sawant alleged, it appears he and Waze were hand-in-glove, and that Waze was reporting to Mumbai CP daily despite the fact het he wasn't his direct boss.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/probe-dissappearance-of-dvr-from-top-cops-office-cong/articleshow/81731123.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

In the most recent case, the cops nabbed two women and recovered11 kg opium from them. The accused have been identified as Lakshmi and Lela Budha. They were on their way to Shimla to deliver opium. The cops claimed that the women were caught on Tuesday when the police were patrolling in Lalru. SP Rural Ravjot Kaur Grewal said, “The women were caught on suspicion and when checked, Lela had 5kg opium in her bag, while the other one had 6 kg opium. During the course of interrogation, they revealed that they had come to India for harvesting of ‘guchhi’ mushroom in Himachal. They met a man, who is also from Nepal, at the bus stand in Delhi. He asked them to deliver one of his parcels in Shimla, for which they would be paid.” Grewal further added that the women were lured in greed of money and they accepted the offer, but were caught by the cops. However, in a similar case, the cops arrested a 14-year-old boy, a native of Nepal, on March 19 and recovered 2kg opium. The cops claimed that the boy met a man named Sunil, who is running an international drug trafficking network from Nepal. According to information, the boy’s parents were living separately for last over eight years and he lost his father last year. “He came to know that his mother was living in Shimla and he wanted to meet her,” said the cops. “Sunil fooled the boy by saying that he knows his mother in Shimla and he would help him meet her. He gave him a parcel of opium weighing 2 kg and directed him to deliver it to a man in Shimla, who would take him to his mother. But he was caught by the police,” said a cop.

The exemption of the registration charges of Rs 10 for the OPD card was waived off this Friday after a nod from the office of the medical superintendent of the PGI. “We are trying to help the amputees and guide them towards government agencies, where artificial limbs can be fitted. PGI will not charge for amputation or tests done before it,” said Prof Mandeep Dhillon, head of the orthopaedics, who conceptualised the special clinic in the institute recently. He said, “We have also exempted such patients from OPD registration. Now we plan to take it forward by extending the same facilitation in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.” The department has also identified occupation of such amputees and based on this, they will generate more financial help for such amputees. “Drivers have been found to have maximum amputation. We are compiling a data and shall soon have more details,” said Prof Dhillon. He said, “Most of the amputees do not know where to contact within the state. There are many government agencies and will help them connect with them.” According to an old study (as very few studies are done in this area), there were nearly 62 amputees in India per one lakh population, which translates to almost one million individuals living with amputations in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgis-amputee-clinic-waives-off-registration-testing-fee/articleshow/81731142.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Urging partymen to uphold dignity during electioneering, DMK president M K Stalin on Saturday asked them not to use derogatory remarks in their public speeches and campaigns and to keep in mind that the path to victory was as important as victory itself. The advice came in the wake of a furore created by the AIADMK over “derogatory” statements by DMK MP A Raja aimed at chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami during his campaign for the party in Tamil Nadu. “The DMK will never condone such speeches,” said Stalin. “Among the three principles laid down by Perarignar Anna (DMK founder C N Annadurai) are duty, dignity and discipline. The party’s orators should uphold dignity first. They should keep this in mind before they speak,” the DMK chief said. He, however, charged rivals of distorting speeches of partymen, fearing defeat. Meanwhile, the ruling AIADMK on Saturday urged the election commission to take strong action against Raja by registering a case and debarring him from campaigning. The party charged him with “repeatedly making vulgar and scandalous speeches” against the CM. In a petition, the AIADMK’s advocate wing joint secretary C Thirumaran said, “The chief electoral officer should take immediate and stringent action against Raja and register a case against him under the provisions of electoral offences as well as under the provisions of IPC. We request immediate action to delist and debar him from undertaking any election campaign hereafter.” In Perambalur, Raja told reporters that his speech was distorted and misinterpreted on social media, while he only compared the personality of Stalin and EPS in public life. “It is absolutely wrong to say that I have made disgraceful remarks against the CM. I don’t have such thoughts. I will not behave so poorly,” the DMK leader said. Meanwhile, PMK leader S Ramadoss condemned Raja for his “derogatory remarks” against the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-assembly-elections-aiadmk-files-complaint-against-dmk-mp-a-raja-with-election-commission/articleshow/81731143.cms||---

The guidelines would be in force for a month starting April 1. The new guidelines lay thrust on effective enforcement of the testtrack-treat protocol. The proportion of RT-PCR tests in the total mix would be scaled up to 70% or more. As effective demarcation of containment zones is key to break the chain of transmissions, the government has asked officials to carefully demarcate the containment areas. Only essential activities shall be allowed in containment zones. There would be strict perimeter control to ensure there is no movement of people in or out of these zones, except for medical emergencies and for maintaining a supply of essential goods and services. Officials will also carry out intensive house-to-house surveillance in the containment zones. At least 80% of contacts shall be traced within 72 hours, apart from listing of all contacts. Wearing of face masks is an essential preventive measure. Authorities may consider administrative action, including imposition of fines, on persons not wearing face masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/covid-surge-test-track-treat-protocol-in-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/81731155.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC cites central law, allows abortion of rape survivor||CHANDIGARH: In perhaps the first case after the recent approval of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2020 providing for termination of pregnancy up to 24-weeks, the Punjab and Haryana high court has asked the PGIMS Rohtak to terminate the pregnancy of a rape survivor who was pregnant beyond 20-weeks. “No doubt, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, provides that the medical termination of pregnancy after a period of 20 weeks is not permissible. However, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2020, has been passed on March 25, 2021, as per which the upper limit of medical termination of pregnancy has been extended to 24 weeks from the present stipulation of 20 weeks, for certain categories of women which includes rape victims. The petitioner in the present case falls in the purview of the new provision,” observed Justice Arun Kshetarpal of the HC while allowing termination of pregnancy of the rape survivor from Rohtak. Justice Kshetarpal also held that the court is required to take into consideration the peculiar facts of each case. “The petitioner, in this case, claims to have become pregnant on account of rape. She is still a minor as she was born on December 15, 2003. She has her entire life ahead,” observed the judge. Court asks medical board to draw foetus sample The HC has also ordered the medical board to draw a sample from the foetus for DNA analysis and handover the same to the prosecution/police. In this case, the minor girl had approached the HC seeking termination of her pregnancy through her mother for being a rape survivor. An FIR related to the incident against the accused person for rape and under POCSO Act has already been registered. Hearing her plea, the HC on March 23, directed the medical board of PGIMS Rohtak to medically examine the petitioner and furnish a report. Themedical board reported that although the foetus has no congenital anomaly, the survivor is anemic. Since this petition was filed through themother (natural guardian) therefore, the HC also sought the independent opinion of the minor girl. For this, the presiding judge of the family court, Rohtak, was asked to interact with the minor petitioner. The survivor, however, told the judge of the family court that she was willing to get the foetus aborted. After considering all the reports, the opinion of the medical board, and the new law passed by the Parliament, the HC directed the medical board, PGIMS, Rohtak, to examine whether there is any risk to the life of the petitioner in carrying out the termination of pregnancy. “If the board comes to a conclusion that there is no risk to the life of the petitioner, then the medical superintendent, PGIMS, Rohtak, will make immediate arrangements for the medical termination of the pregnancy of the minor petitioner,” ordered the high court.

The miscreant, who managed to hide inside the main temple complex after it closed at around 9 pm on Friday, made several unsuccessful attempts to open the hundi kept near the Dwajasthambham. “We have lodged a complaint with the local police and are analysing the CCTV footage. No valuables were reported to be stolen,” TTD’s chief vigilance and security officer Gopinath Jatti said. The thief may have quietly walked out of the temple after it opened for pilgrim worship on Saturday. The incident came to light after temple priests noticed the torn hundi cloth and things strewn around it near the Dwajasthambham.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/andhra-pradesh-man-attempts-to-steal-valuables-from-temple/articleshow/81731171.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

The extension will be given to those who were convicted in or after 2017. They were released in the wake of a surge in Covid-19 cases last year. The order is expected to benefit more than 2,500 convicts and undertrials who are on interim bail or parole. The decision was taken in the 13th meeting of the high-powered committee (HPC) held on Friday under the chairmanship of Justice Rajan Gupta of Punjab and Haryana high court, who is also the executive chairman of Haryana State Legal Services Authority (HSLSA). The committee was constituted in March 2020 on the direction of the Supreme Court to take a call on the release of convicts and undertrials on interim bail or parole in the wake of Covid-19 surge. Following this, 658 were released on parole, while 1,359 were granted interim bail. The meeting was attended by advocate general Baldev Raj Mahajan, ACS (home) Rajeev Arora, director general of prisons K. Selvaraj, and district & sessions judge-cum-member secretary (HSLSA) Parmod Goyal. The committee in its last meeting held on February 11 had directed the jail authorities to readmit 2,580 convicts, who were involved in heinous offences, from February 23 onwards in nine staggered phases. “Now, in view of the current strength of inmates in jails, a surge in Covid cases and ongoing readmission of 2,580 convicts, the panel has extended parole and interim bail of convicts and undertrials, who are sentenced up to 07 years or facing trial for offences which stipulate maximum imprisonment up to 7 years, till May 31,” said a court statement. The jail authorities were directed to submit a surrender plan by May 10. During the review, it was found that out of 879 convicts, 851 surrendered, while eight convicts were given extended parole by the high court. While one convict was released prematurely by the government, 11 convicts died and eight absconded. The panel also allowed vaccination to all inmates eligible under the criteria fixed by the central government with their consent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/extension-of-parole-bail-for-convicts-undertrials/articleshow/81729369.cms||---

But on the ground, it’s a different story that’s being scripted for lack of coordination among allies and few or no joint campaigns that could showcase alliance cohesion and unity. Functionaries maintain distance from their counterparts in allied parties either due to interparty animosity or differing ideologies. In the process, rivals are gaining in certain pockets in TN. The BJP cadres stayed away from a Muslim-dominated neighbourhood when minister D Jayakumar was campaigning on Tuesday. He was there to seek votes from 200 families in Mint Modern City falling in his Royapuram assembly segment and to meet the elders to seek votes. The BJP cadres were stopped near Srinivasapuram and taken along later near Boja Raja Nagar. BJP sources say it’s the same situation in other constituencies, including ministers K C Veeramani’s Jolarpet and Dindigul C Sreenivasan’s Dindigul seat. “In several parts of the state, AIADMK candidates tell BJP cadres not to join campaigns and if they insist, not to carry their flags. Instead, they want us to remain in the booths,” said a BJP leader. It is no different in the DMK-Congress front. The DMK cadres had threatened self-immolation and took out a protest rally in Aranthangi in Pudukkottai district, when the DMK allotted the seat to Congress for the third time in a row. The Congress nominee is Trichy LS MP S Thirunavukkarasar’s son S T Ramachandran, who lost the seat in 2016. “A section of cadres is disenchanted with the leadership,” said a Congress leader, seeking anonymity. In Chennai’s Harbour constituency where BJP’s Vinoj Selvam is pitted against DMK’s Sekar Babu, the AIADMK prefers to campaign with the candidate in the evening on Mint Street but goes door-to-door on their own in the morning. In Ramanathapuram down south, AIADMK cadres are a dejected lot. The BJP has fielded D Kuppuramu, former VHP state president. The local minority leaders say it is ‘embarrassing’ to accompany the candidate. “The situation is very bad after the BJP passed contentious laws such as CAA,” a senior AIADMK leader said, seeking anonymity. Sensing trouble, certain BJP candidates shy away from using photographs of their national leaders during electioneering. Instead, BJP state president L Murugan and party candidates Khushbu Sundar, K Annamalai and Nainar Nagendran seek to project themselves as “Amma Aasi Petra Vetpalar (candidate who has the blessings of Jayalalithaa).” Sometimes, the BJP candidates wear AIADMK party shawls to deflect the voter antagonism. P Saravanan (Madurai North), and G Pandurangan (Virudhunagar), who joined the BJP ahead of the polls, bank on the AIADMK and its populist schemes. “We find a few candidates don’t utter the names of our leaders Narendra Modi or Amit Shah,” said a party source.

---||Chandigarh||Vaccination drive off to a slow start at Delhi borders, 412 farmers jabbed||CHANDIGARH: Vaccination turned out to be slow starter on the Singhu-Kundli border and almost a non-starter at Tikri border in Bahadurgarh town of Jhajjar district of Haryana. Health authorities, in collaboration with Indian Red Cross, had started vaccination at Singhu and Tikri borders on March 17. Vaccination picked up pace at Singhu-Kundli border later. On Saturday, 412 farmers received the first dose of the vaccine here. Health authorities have set up one vaccination site at the agitation site and one at Rasoi Dhaba. Dr Avnita, nodal officer, expressed satisfaction over farmers’ turnout at Singhu. “The turnout could be low as compared to cities or other sites. You see the kind of challenges but farmers are coming with word of mouth. Our volunteers do visit camps but the actual result is due to motivation by their own people. We have a mixed crowd of men and women. Rest, we shall continue and are hopeful that the number will go up in the time to come, especially after April 1, when we shall start vaccination for other categories,” she said. Meanwhile, health officials are making attempts to convince agitating farmers, their supporters and workers in kitchens to get themselves vaccinated. Sources said one vaccination site has been set up at HL City area. They added that the vaccination at HL City and Rasoi Dhaba started on the same day, but at HL City site, which is close to the agitation site in Tikri, only 10 persons have been vaccinated so far. “First, farmers need to be volunteers. Secondly, one vial contains 10 injections and we are supposed to keep wastage under control. We cannot afford to waste as we have to give explanation as well. “Also, farmers are discussing this with their committee. We hope to pick up pace after Holi,” said Dr Vinay Deswal, nodal officer for healthcare and medical facilities for agitating farmers at Tikri border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/vaccination-drive-off-to-a-slow-start-at-delhi-borders-412-farmers-jabbed/articleshow/81731225.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Gurgaon||Sadar Bazar vehicle-free? Bikes are still causing chaos||GURUGRAM: The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has decided to conduct from March 30 a second phase of a trial to make Sadar Bazar vehicle-free. The first phase of the trial, which started on March 20, ended on Saturday. A visit to one of the city’s oldest markets revealed that despite the drive, two-wheelers continued to be parked along the internal roads haphazardly. There was no mechanism to check if the two-wheelers were of the customers or shop owners. Before enforcing the first phase of the drive, MCG had decided not to allow any vehicle on the internal roads of the market. But traders objected to the proposal, saying that the civic body should at least allow two-wheelers of customers. The move has met with little success, as hundreds of two-wheelers parked haphazardly are leading to congestion every day. Officials said they would deploy 250 civic volunteers to ensure proper parking of two-wheelers in the second phase of the drive. But before enforcing round 2, MCG representatives will hold a meeting with shop owners to decide the duration of the drive. MCG officials want the second phase to be at least 2 weeks along. The final decision on the second phase will be taken at the meeting.  “We will start the second phase after a meeting with traders on Tuesday. The trial should at least be for 14 days, during which we will ensure strict enforcement of parking norms. We will now have volunteers from the civil defence team to implement the rules,” said Jitender Kumar, joint commissioner 2 at MCG. The official said the volunteers would also check if traders were parking their two-wheelers near their shops. According to an agreement with the shopwners earlier, only customers are allowed to bring their two-wheelers inside the market. Shoppers had a mixed response to the vehicle-free drive. While some said the weeklong trial had ensured that the internal roads had space for walkers at least, others insisted that the market should be rid of two-wheelers too. They suggested that only non-motorised transport, such as cycles, should be allowed in the market. “The redevelopment of Sadar Bazar will happen only when no vehicles are allowed here. Cars and two-wheelers of both customers and traders should not be allowed in the market at all. We obviously cannot make it London, but we can at least take small steps to make things better,” said Kriti Jain, a resident of Sector 12. The seven-day vehicle-free trial of the MCG had started at Sadar Bazar on March 20. On the very first day, traders and shop owners had launched a protest against the drive and shut their shops for some time. A meeting with MCG officials was held that evening, when the two sides reached a consensus that two-wheelers of customers should be allowed in the market along with those of elderly and differently-abled shop owners. Moreover, the civic body had also allowed the entry of supply vehicles till 12pm to the market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/sadar-bazar-vehicle-free-bikes-are-still-causing-chaos/articleshow/81728495.cms||Vishakha Chaman

It is here that BJP’s 'polarising rhetoric' is finding many takers. Famous for Baresaharia Bhaona (mythological folk theatre), Jamuguri falls under Sootea constituency. Here, the Muslim migrant has for long been the bogeyman for indigenous communities. Politicians have played on this imaginary fear of Muslims taking over all land to divide people. However, it’s the food produced by migrant Muslims that have been feeding the people here. Community elders have always worked for communal harmony. And the bhaona has been a tool to achieve that. “The residents of many villages in this area took the initiative about 220 years ago to stage Baresaharia bhaona. The objective was to promote our culture in a bigger way,” said the chief organiser of the Jamuguri Baresaharia Bhaona Committee, Bhaba Goswami. He is all praise for local BJP MLA Padma Hazarika, who made a political career out of his participation in the Assam Agitation in the 1980s. Hazarika has himself performed as a bhaona artiste and is liked by the locals. “Everyone may not be happy with the BJP, but the people’s good wishes are with Padma Hazarika for his efforts for drawing the attention of the government towards developing the infrastructure and for promoting Vaishnavite culture. He played a big role in the state government providing Rs 26 crore to erect a grand stage to perform Baresaharia Bhaona,” Goswami added. Hazarika was first elected to the assembly on an AGP ticket in 1996. Since 2006, he has been the Sootea MLA for three consecutive terms, though in 2016, he won on a BJP ticket. Award-winning author Prarthana Saikia thinks that the religious and cultural beliefs of the caste Hindu majority will likely influence the vote. “But it isn’t black and white. People don’t know how their interests will be protected and which party will serve them the best,” said Saikia, the winner of Sahitya Akademi’s Yuva Puraskar. She added that netas and goons are having a field day as a result. Congress is trying to make inroads here with its five guarantees campaign. Its candidate Praneswar Basumatary has been trying to win hearts. But poll watchers say “nationalism will prevail” despite job losses due to Covid or price rise or other burning issues. “Most people here don’t blame one person for joblessness. The anguish of the youths who lost jobs during the Covid crisis may not be the deciding factor in the polls,” said a young voter on condition of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/advantage-bjp-in-sootea-as-nationalism-likely-to-trump-burning-issues/articleshow/81731266.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Gurgaon||In age of digital marketing, are colours important for a brand?||By Shivaji Dasgupta It is time for Holi and thus wholly appropriate to discuss colours. We know that historically, brand custodians have been obsessed about the sanctity of colours but the jury is certainly out on its impact on customer behaviour. It is fairly well established that colours are a vital source for both familiarity and authenticity — the two rational pillars for choice. When we see red in a sea of beverages, we know that it is Coca Cola and it becomes a shortcut for brand meaning. The same is indeed true for Pepsi. But the palette is fairly limited in repertoire, so the meaning of red is greatly contextual — equally applicable to Airtel, a political party, Eveready, whisky or tea. Most interestingly, this decoding is grossly unconnected to our primary decoding of red, the symbol of danger as manifested in traffic lights, warning signals and common vocabulary. Therefore, colours cannot be considered a non-negotiable element of a brand’s integrity, simply because they are not ownable in a rational, emotional or even category context. In an era of print and outdoor advertising, they became valuable tools for communicators to drive salience and recall — the giant billboard or the full page ad and thus prolific ambassadors for a wishful property. Especially to audiences with lower levels of literacy or to youth seeking pizza, colours provided hi-fi impact often without any sustainable meaning. In this digital age of branding, colours can no longer be considered to be high net worth brand assets. This pattern has been initiated by the brands themselves, Google pioneering the flamboyant and flexible template. Apple never quite invested in this subject, with the exception of the Issey Miyake black, and this is true for most technology brands. Swiggy and Zomato do try to own their respective zones but that helps at best in aiding identification, limited role in perception formation, as is the case with Urban Company and so many of its ilk. Most certainly, the aesthetic application of design elements contribute to the overall impression but that is where the matter terminally concludes. In the rapidly expanding domain of FMCG and foods, the problem is simply more complex, however oxymoronic it sounds. There are not enough colours for brands to successfully own and efficiently amplify — especially when thwarted by the filtration of colour codes and other semiotic variables. So a Maggi enjoys historical shelf life visibility due to yellow and an ITC Master Chef has to break most category conventions by applying black on its RTE Master Chef packaging. For most players, large or minute, the challenge is actually standout value where the fonts, photography and physical design are more prolific scorers. There is an opportunity to concoct special colours through enhanced technology but its impact on costs can be staggering, visible sporadically in premium liquor packaging. To populate this hypothesis even further, it is crucial to evaluate the role of colours in our daily lives and forge a cross-connection with brands. Due to liberal work cultures, conventions have been demolished and light-hearted shades are now welcome in the boardroom. Friday Dressing, as envisioned by Allen Solly, has now become a daily ensemble and the crippling correlation between colours of apparel and sincerity of worth is dipping daily. Even in haute fashion and in its replication industries, colours are temporary heroes, giving way cyclically to ravenous successors. We take colours less seriously these days and brands must respect this transition as well. In sum, brands of this era must consider colours to be friends who are conversation partners, not binding or rather blinding authorities. Those who enjoy a historical advantage like Coke or Maggi may continue to take advantage but for the overwhelming majority, they are no longer ownable IP.

IL&FS had in September 2019 terminated the Rapid Metro concession agreement, alleging there were multiple obligations that HSVP had not met and demanded payments due to them under the concession agreement. The Supreme Court has asked HSVP to deposit 80% of the total “debt due” (Rs 2,407 crore). HSVP said it is planning to seek legal opinion and might file a review petition. “I am yet to go through the entire order, but as of now, we will be seeking a legal opinion on this matter,” Ajit Balaji Joshi, HSVP chief administrator, told TOI on Saturday. Joshi is also managing director of Haryana Mass Rapid Transport Corporation (HMRTC). IL&FS had bagged the Rapid Metro project, which was developed through its subsidiary SPVs – Rapid Metro Rail Gurugram Limited (RMGL) and Rapid Metro Rail Gurugram South Limited (RMGSL) – in 2009 and 2013, in two phases. According to the concession agreement, the asset was to be handed over to HSVP in case of a termination of the agreement and IL&FS was entitled to termination payment of 80% the debt due in case IL&FS defaults and 100% of the debt due in case HSVP defaults. HSVP challenged this in the Punjab and Haryana high court in September 2019. The high court, after hearing both parties, directed IL&FS to hand over operations and maintenance of Rapid Metro to HSVP. It also asked the Comptroller & Auditor General to carry out a financial audit to determine total debt due and directed HSVP to pay 80% of debt due as determined by CAG. Acting on the HC order, IL&FS handed over Rapid Metro to HSVP in October 2019 and CAG submitted the debt due report to the HC in September 2020, in which it stated that the total debt due was Rs 2,407 crore. In January 2021, IL&FS moved the Supreme Court, claiming HSVP had failed to comply with the high court order, citing several reasons. Welcoming the SC decision, an IL&FS spokesperson said, “The order will go a long way in protecting the interest of investors by enforcing legitimate contracts in the infrastructure sector.” Talking to TOI, Nadim Akhtar advisor planning, HMRTC said he was yet to see the order. “I am suffering from Covid due to which I am yet to go through the order,” he said. The order was passed on Friday by a three-judge bench of justices DY Chandrachud, MR Shah and Sanjiv Khanna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/hsvp-asked-to-put-rs-1925-crore-in-escrow-account-in-rapid-metro-row/articleshow/81728520.cms||Joel Joseph

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union minister Amit Shah on behalf of the BJP and Rahul Gandhi on behalf of the Congress have already visited Tamil Nadu, it was much before seat sharing talks and release of the candidate lists. BJP national president J P Nadda was the first senior leader to visit Tamil Nadu and campaign for the party on Friday since candidates were named. Union minister Smriti Irani joined the list on Saturday, when she campaigned in Coimbatore and Chennai for BJP candidates. When it comes to investing time and energy by a national party leader for a state assembly election, no one can beat the record set by former Prime Minister and Congress president Rajiv Gandhi in Tamil Nadu in the run up to the 1989 assembly election. Despite his numerous visits and roadshows, the Congress could still get only the third position, after the DMK and a divided AIADMK. The BJP, which is determined to break into Tamil Nadu this time, and the Congress, under pressure to retain its available foothold in the state, have lined up their national resources to give the campaign a big push in the coming week. Prime minister Modi, Union ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh and Nirmala Sitharaman are set to join the campaign bandwagon. While Modi will visit the state on March 30 and April 2, Shah will visit Ramanathapuram and Tirunelveli in the first week of April too. The BJP leaders are largely restricting their campaigns to constituencies where the party candidates are in the fray, as the AIADMK candidates have reportedly expressed reservations over engaging BJP leaders to campaign for them. On behalf of the Congress, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi are set to address meetings in Salem, Kanyakumari and Chennai, with Congress leaders too largely restricting themselves to assembly segments where their party candidates are in the fray. On Sunday, Rahul Gandhi will address an election meeting at Adyar and later join DMK president M K Stalin to address a joint public meeting near Salem. Priyanka Gandhi is scheduled to visit Kanyakumari on April 2 to boost the chances of her party Lok Sabha bypoll candidate Vijay Vasanth, as the party felt the focus of its ally DMK is centred around the assembly poll. Senior leaders Veerappa Moily, who is already campaigning, and Oomen Chandy are extending additional support. “But Congress president Sonia Gandhi won’t be visiting the state,” TNCC president K S Alagiri said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/national-leaders-of-bjp-congress-descend-on-tamil-nadu/articleshow/81731298.cms||D Govardan

---||Kochi||Kerala assembly polls 2021: If Pinarayi Vijayan continues, it will be an autocratic government, says A K Antony||If Pinarayi government retains power, the biggest casualty will be CPM itself because of the concentration of power in one person’s hands, said senior Congress leader and former defence minister A K Antony . In an exclusive interview with Jaikrishnan Nair , Antony says the UDF will win the assembly polls and the victory will strengthen the Congress across the country. Excerpts:What factors will help the UDF in the upcoming polls?Apart from the votes of UDF supporters, neutral voters who know the danger of the continuation of LDF rule will also vote for UDF. If Pinarayi government retains power, the biggest casualty will be CPM. A section of CPM sympathisers who had seen CPM getting ruined after 34 years of party rule in West Bengal does not want that to repeat in Kerala. They will vote for UDF. The hallmark of LDF government is arrogance, obstinacy, extravagance, pomp and corruption. In this situation, if Pinarayi continues in power it will be an autocratic government beyond anyone’s control. So the continuation of LDF rule is impossible. Is domination of Pinarayi Vijayan in government and party setting a bad example?Even CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury does not want the continuation of LDF rule as politburo will become just a namesake if the front retains power. LDF will get restricted to Pinarayi alone. The party and government will be controlled by one individual. The PR work of CPM will also have a negative impact. It has now come to a point that there is no one in the party other than Pinarayi. A party, front and a government that is centered around one person is dangerous. Your views on Sabarimala issue and its likely impact on polls?I never wanted to react on Sabarimala. But the CM’s reaction on the issue is prompting me to speak up. He is now saying that he will implement the final verdict on Sabarimala only after holding talks with all. ‘Devotees know the danger of LDF retaining power’This was what we were demanding right from the beginning. When the verdict came, we had warned him not to take any hasty decisions. The CM took the decision even before seeing the copy of the verdict. Opposition leader, NSS, various forums of devotees had all urged the CM to hold talks. If he had agreed then, violence would not have happened. Will Sabarimala affect the chances of LDF?The CM tried to divide Hindus in the state. Those supporting as well as opposing ‘renaissance’. The whole issue began after two women were escorted by hundreds of cops from Pamba to Marakoottam. This picture is embedded in the minds of lakhs and lakhs of devotees. They will think about it on April 6 when they go to the polling booth. The CM who had taken a stand that he will implement the verdict had to soften his stand. The devotees know the danger of LDF retaining power. Will BJP benefit from the issue?BJP will not benefit from the issue. They also cheated devotees. PM Narendra Modi said in Thiruvananthapuram that he will take steps to protect faith and customs of devotees. The BJP-led NDA government at the Centre hasn’t done that so far and has only fooled devotees. Your take on BJP state president K Surendran claiming that if BJP wins 35 seats they will form the government?It’s a very unfortunate statement. That too from the top state leader of the party which is in power at the Centre. But it’s not surprising. He belongs to the party which has torpedoed Congress chief ministers one after the other to form governments. But it will not happen in this state. How will BJP fare in Nemom?The BJP cannot boast about winning Nemom seat as the credit goes to O Rajagopal alone. It is the special consideration and interest of the people of Thiruvananthapuram which led to his victory. Once K Muraleedharan was announced as the candidate the scene is changing fast. Muraleedharan is the son of K Karunakaran who was the Nemom MLA and a lot of people in the constituency are emotionally attached to him. Rajagopal won on a sympathy wave favouring him. BJP will lose the seat this time. Your views on the state government’s decision to go for a judicial inquiry against Enforcement Directorate?It’s a drama between CPM and BJP. The BJP agenda is ‘Congress Mukt Bharat’. BJP leaders want to destabilise all Congress governments. So I strongly suspect that as the polling date closes in, the national leadership of BJP will ask its cadres in some of the constituencies to vote for CPM candidates to ensure that a Congress chief minister will not come in Kerala. Though CPM is at loggerheads with BJP, it will follow the policy of ‘enemy’s enemy is a friend’. If a Congress comes to power in Kerala, it will inspire Congress party to resurrect like a phoenix across the nation and take on the central government and its policies. BJP doesn’t want such a situation. Was the local body poll results an eye-opener for UDF?The wickedness of CM and CPM led to a wedge between religions and communities. They tried to divide Muslims, Christians and Hindus and tried to create division among Hindu forward and backward castes. However, after the local body elections, people are having a rethink. Kerala is not North India. We can’t be permanent enemies. Now the friendship between the communities has been restored. This time UDF has got the support of all communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-assembly-polls-2021-if-pinarayi-continues-it-will-be-an-autocratic-government-says-a-k-antony/articleshow/81731341.cms||---

In a review meeting that took place earlier this month, officials were of the view that the property rates should not be increased at this stage. However, the stamp and registration department is likely to revise property and land in the city during the next fiscal year. Though in the two meetings held during the month of March between officials of Gautam Budh Nagar district administration, the department and senior executives of the three industrial development authorities, a consensus on the matter could not be reached. The administration will review the situation of the real estate market in Noida and Greater Noida in July before taking a final call. The rates across the city were last revised in 2016.

This would effectively mean that only religious parties, registered as “religious society” under the Societies Registration Act will be eligible for registration and will be issued a common symbol for gurdwara elections. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) had moved the Delhi high court challenging the minster’s March16 order, which said, “Rule (14), as stands today, has to be strictly followed and only those who are eligible religious parties are to be recognised as such. It is further made clear that only such recognised religious parties are to be allotted reserved symbol in terms of Rule 14 aforesaid as it stands today.” SAD described the minster’s communication as unconstitutional and ultra vires the parent Act, that is the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Act, 1971. It sought to restrain the respondents from acting upon this communication and also on the amended Rule 14 of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (Election of Members) Rules, 1974, in the forthcoming elections scheduled to be held in April – May, 2021. The bench of Justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Amit Bansal on Friday held the question of staying operation of the Rule 14 supra does not arise. “Operation of Rule 14 supra, which is subordinate legislation, cannot be stayed by an interim order and until this court concludes that the same is liable to be struck down,” the Bench ordered. However, it stayed the operation of the minister’s communication till further orders. Meanwhile, in the case of the petition moved by Paramjit Singh Sarna-led SAD (Delhi), who had also challenged the letter, Justice Prateek Jalan in his order, noted that further to the order of the court on March 25, senior counsel for the petitioner stated that the petitioner had been registered as a society under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, by an order passed by the registrar on March 25. “In this view of the matter, the petitioner proposes to approach the director of gurdwara elections for registration as a new religious party under Rule 14 (3) (d) of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (Election of Members) Rules, 1974, as amended on 28.07.2010.” The order further noted that Delhi government counsel accepted this course of action, subject to the petitioner’s undertaking before the director of gurdwara elections that it is a religious and not political party. SAD (Delhi)’s counsel confirmed to the court that the petitioner had no objection to an undertaking as such. “Once the petitioner is registered as a religious party, the petitioner will also approach the director for allotment of the reserved symbol ‘car’ to it,” the order noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/dsgmc-polls-delhi-hc-stays-ministers-order-no-relief-to-sad/articleshow/81731323.cms||IP Singh

Sgt Frank Jang of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team said a suspect was in custody. He said the man is in his 20s and has had interactions with police in the past. Jang said officials didn't have any information yet about a motive. One witness, Steve Mossop, said he and his partner stopped in traffic when they saw a bloodied woman who told them she had just been stabbed. They then saw several victims within about 100 meters (yards) of each other, he said. "There was a man, there was an older woman, there was a younger woman, a mom, a random group of individuals in the wrong place at the wrong time," Mossop said. It seemed like he was just running in a direction, whoever was in his path happened to be victimized, Mossop said of the attacker.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Gangster who escaped from GTB hospital shot dead||NEW DELHI: Three days after making a daring escape from custody at the Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital (GTB) hospital in Delhi, notorious gangster Kuldeep Maan alias Fajja was shot dead in northwest Delhi's Rohini area in the early hours of Sunday. Highly placed sources confirmed that a fierce gunfight had broken out inside a house around 1.30am when a team led by DCP Pramod Kushwaha and ACPs Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan conducted a raid. Fajja opened fire at police with automatic weapons and was killed in retaliatory firing. On March 25, amidst high drama in the premises of the (GTB) hospital, Delhi Armed Police (DAP) personnel shot dead a criminal and injured another after they tried to free an inmate from their custody on Thursday noon. The inmate, Kuldeep Maan alias Fajja, had been brought to the GTB hospital for a checkup. The criminals, who came in a Scorpio SUV having a police sticker, first opened fire in the air and then threw chilli powder at the cops and tried to free Kuldeep but cops recovered quickly and shot at two of them, killing one of them in the process. The accused then fled in different directions, leaving their Scorpio behind. The inmate managed to flee in the melee and a manhunt has been launched for them. According to police, Fajja was brought to the hospital for treatment at the OPD. Incidentally, he was also brought to the hospital on Wednesday. He had been visiting the hospital for his abdominal issues multiple times in the last couple of months. While a team of four policemen were escorting him out, another cop was finishing the paperwork formalities inside. When they reached near the outside building, around 10-15 men tried to fire while one of them caught a cop from behind. As this cop tried to retaliate and remove his service pistol, it got locked and meanwhile, he asked the other cop to open fire. At least 20 rounds were fired, 12 from the policemen escorting Fajja. In the commotion, Fajja along with his associates managed to flee while two of his associates sustained bullet wounds. The deceased identified as Ravi Malik, sustained a bullet wound on his chest and collapsed while trying to flee towards Gate number-1. His associate Ankesh who sustained two bullet wounds on his abdomen fell near the waste plant and is undergoing treatment. Two of the accused ran towards Gate number-7 of the GTB hospital where they intercepted a man identified as Kapil Yadav who had come from UP for his pregnant wife’s check-up. The duo then pushed the couple and pointed a pistol at Yadav and robbed his motorcycle. While leaving they fired three rounds in the air and fled. Luckily, his pregnant wife did not sustain any injury. Another family member accompanying them was also safe. Vinay Pal, who runs a chole-kulcha stall and an eyewitness to the motorcycle robbery incident said “I was carrying out my usual work when we heard the chaos and firing. Immediately all of us tried to run for shelter but in the meantime, two men rushed out and pushed a man who was about to sit on his motorcycle. The man was with two women, including his wife, who was pregnant and she was pushed as well. The man fell down and was pointed a pistol at soon after which the two accused fired in the air and fled on the bike. Some of us shut our shops for a while". Police recovered around four pistols from the crime scene and some clothes and weapons from the Scorpio. Investigations revealed that the Scorpio car had a fake Delhi number plate and the owner was traced in Haryana.

---||India||BSP MLA Ram Bai’s husband Govind arrested from Bhind||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh special task force (STF) on Sunday arrested Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA Ram Bai’s absconding husband – Govind Singh from Bhind, after a frantic search operation. He was rounded up from the bus stand area. Director general of police (DGP) Vivek Johri said he would be produced before Damoh district court. Searches were being carried out at multiple locations, he added. The Supreme Court had warned the director general of police (DGP) to either comply with the court’s order for his arrest, or face coercive action. A bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud had ruled, "We find the affidavit of the Director General of Police to be completely unacceptable. It defies reason as to how an accused who is the spouse of a sitting member of the legislative assembly has not been arrested despite being arraigned in pursuance of the provisions of Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 to face trial for an offence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code 1860." DGP Madhya Pradesh had filed affidavit stating that despite the efforts which have been made in pursuance of the previous order dated March 12, 2021, the police have not been able to apprehend and arrest the accused. After going through the affidavit court had said further that “An effort is being made to shield the accused from the due process of criminal law. The Court was informed that earlier, the accused was even given security by the police though it is stated by Counsel for the State that it is now withdrawn”. Order reads, “We issue a direction to the Director General of Police to take necessary steps to ensure that the previous order of this Court is complied with before the next date of listing, failing which the Court will be constrained to take coercive steps in accordance with law”. DGP has also been asked to submit a further affidavit setting out: (i) The date on which and the cause on the basis of which security was granted to the accused; (ii) Whether the security continues to be provided as of date; and (iii) If not, the date on which the security was withdrawn. Next date of hearing has been slated for April 5. Recently police headquarters had increased the bounty on any information leading to the arrest of Govind Singh to Rs 50000 besides sending a special team led by chief of special task force (STF) for raiding villages in Damoh district. Police and local administration also demolished walls of a land encroached upon by the BSP MLA’s family in Damoh. Police had also arrested Govind’s brother and nephew. Govind Singh – is accused in the two-year-old murder case of Congress leader Davendra Chourasia. PHQ had ordered STF chief Vipin Maheswari to ensure his arrest following the Supreme Court’s direction of the DGP V K Johri, taking serious note of the state police’s failure to round up the accused. In the previous hearing, the apex court had also taken ‘serious note’ of the alleged harassment of a judicial officer by the Damoh Superintendent of Police and asked the DGP to inquire into the allegations levelled by the Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ). The ASJ, who is conducting a trial in the cases involving Govind Singh, the husband of BSP MLA Rambai Singh, has arrayed him as an accused in the murder case under section 319 of CrpC (Power to proceed against other persons appearing to be guilty of offence), according to agency reports. The judge had noted in his February 8 order that he is being pressured by the Damoh SP and his subordinates. SC was hearing pleas by Devendra Chaurasia’s son, and the state government seeking the cancellation of bail granted to Davendra Singh in another case. Court said that the ASJ has apprehended that he may be subjected to an "unpleasant incident" in the future.

Meanwhile, Facebook group ‘Indians in New Zealand’, where he and others has posted messages, has also been deleted. Tarun Madan, whose Facebook profile mentions that he hails from Delhi, was arrested on March 19 and later released on bail. He was arrested again on Friday morning by the Auckland police, after he was found to have violated a restriction laid down in his bail order. In a post in ‘Indians in New Zealand’ group, the Sikh youth on whose complaint police registered a case and arrested Madan, was called a “Khalistani terrorist”. His mobile phone number was also given in the post and he was accused of running malicious hate campaign against all Indians. The post asked people to report him to police while posting his pictures. Madan, in his comments on the same FB group, had threatened to come to the Sikh’s residence to teach him a lesson. In the same post, he also abused two other Sikh men. The comments by Indians in New Zealand on social media platforms were largely a fallout of bitterness between groups supporting and opposing the three contentious farm laws being opposed by the farmers here. A similar bitterness has also been visible in Canada and Australia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/in-new-zealand-indian-held-for-threatening-sikh-youth-rearrested/articleshow/81731509.cms||IP Singh
---||---||PM Modi in Bangladesh: Not the first time a row over 'campaign' got stirred||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bangladesh on Saturday is being viewed as an extension of the BJP’s campaign for the West Bengal assembly elections on a day when the state faced the first of polls. On at least three previous occasions Modi’s actions on polling day or just a day before that have triggered a controversy. At the invitation of his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina for the twin occasions of the neighbouring country’s 50 years of nationhood and the centenary of Bangabandhu Mujibur Rahman, PM Modi reached Dhaka on Friday on a two-day visit. On Saturday, the day West Bengal faced first of the eight phases of elections, he visited Orakandi, a small town in Gopalganj which is considered to be the cradle of the Matua Mahasangha. It is the birthplace of Matua sect founder Harichand Thakur. He delivered a speech after offering prayers at the Orakandi Temple. The Matua Mahasangha was founded around 1860 in Orakandi in Bangladesh. A sizeable number of Matuas migrated to West Bengal during the 1947 partition. The next lot came during the 1971 war and the creation of Bangladesh. Matuas are a sect of Vaishnavite Hindus. Around three crore Matuas are settled around the Thakurnagar area of North and South 24 Parganas and Nadia in bordering West Bengal. Believed to vote en bloc, they are dominant in about 35 assembly seats in these districts. Till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Matuas voted for West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC). However, Shantanu Thakur of the BJP won the Bongaon seat in 2019, defeating Mamata Bala of the TMC. The BJP led in nearly 20 of the 35 assembly segments with a significant Matua population in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Shantanu’s brother Subrata Thakur is the BJP candidate from Gaighata assembly constituency. Shantanu accompanied PM Modi to Orakandi. Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Bangladesh is likely to not just consolidate in general the Hindu voters who have migrated from the neighbouring country but also attract in particular the Matuas in favour of the BJP. At least on three previous occasions, PM Modi’s actions were linked to elections and they stirred a controversy. 2014 Lok Sabha electionsAn FIR was lodged against Modi, the then Gujarat chief minister and BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, on the instructions of the Election Commission for allegedly violating the election model code of conduct (MCC). After casting his vote in a booth in Ranip in Gandhinagar Lok Sabha constituency on April 30, 2014, Modi addressed a press conference outside the booth. While attacking the Congress, he was accused of taking a selfie with BJP’s election symbol 'lotus' and repeatedly displaying it. The Congress party approached the EC and complain that Modi had violated the MCC. On the orders of the EC, the crime branch police in Ahmedabad filed an FIR against Modi. Modi was booked under Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act. 2017 Gujarat assembly electionPrime Minister Modi had drawn criticism during the 2017 Gujarat assembly elections for flouting safety norms for travel of VVIPs. On November 14, 2017 - the last day of campaigning for the second phase of assembly election in Gujarat - Modi took a seaplane flight from the Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad to the Dharoi dam in Mehsana district. While the Kodiak seaplane that Modi flew in was a single-engine aircraft, safety norms require a Z+-protectee to travel in a twin-engine aircraft. Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said in a tweet: “How is it that the security guidelines were relaxed for this flight? No Z+ protectee is allowed to fly in a single-engine aircraft, much less the PM of our country.” He said in another tweet: “Single-engine plane. Foreign pilots. Is there any security guideline that will not be thrown out today?” The PM sought to show the progress that Gujarat had made in the BJP’s rule but he was criticised for using the seaplane as a publicity stunt and a means to campaign for the elections. 2019 Lok Sabha electionsOn May 18, 2019, a day before the seventh and last phase of the Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi visited Kedarnath in Uttarakhand and worshipped in the famous temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. Subsequently, he entered inside a cave and spent the night inside it. On May 19, the day of the last phase of elections, Modi reached Badrinath and prayed in a temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The visit was seen as a move to consolidate the Hindu voters. Modi had sought permission from the Election Commission for the visit to the Kedarnath temple. The EC gave its nod while “reminding” the Prime Minister’s Office that the MCC was still in force. Modi thanked the EC for granting him permission to visit the Kedarnath shrine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/pm-modi-in-bangladesh-not-the-first-time-a-row-over-campaign-got-stirred/articleshow/81731318.cms||Kumar Shakti Shekhar
---||India||PM Modi in Bangladesh: Not the first time a row over 'campaign' got stirred||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bangladesh on Saturday is being viewed as an extension of the BJP’s campaign for the West Bengal assembly elections on a day when the state faced the first of polls. On at least three previous occasions Modi’s actions on polling day or just a day before that have triggered a controversy. At the invitation of his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina for the twin occasions of the neighbouring country’s 50 years of nationhood and the centenary of Bangabandhu Mujibur Rahman, PM Modi reached Dhaka on Friday on a two-day visit. On Saturday, the day West Bengal faced first of the eight phases of elections, he visited Orakandi, a small town in Gopalganj which is considered to be the cradle of the Matua Mahasangha. It is the birthplace of Matua sect founder Harichand Thakur. He delivered a speech after offering prayers at the Orakandi Temple. The Matua Mahasangha was founded around 1860 in Orakandi in Bangladesh. A sizeable number of Matuas migrated to West Bengal during the 1947 partition. The next lot came during the 1971 war and the creation of Bangladesh. Matuas are a sect of Vaishnavite Hindus. Around three crore Matuas are settled around the Thakurnagar area of North and South 24 Parganas and Nadia in bordering West Bengal. Believed to vote en bloc, they are dominant in about 35 assembly seats in these districts. Till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Matuas voted for West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC). However, Shantanu Thakur of the BJP won the Bongaon seat in 2019, defeating Mamata Bala of the TMC. The BJP led in nearly 20 of the 35 assembly segments with a significant Matua population in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Shantanu’s brother Subrata Thakur is the BJP candidate from Gaighata assembly constituency. Shantanu accompanied PM Modi to Orakandi. Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Bangladesh is likely to not just consolidate in general the Hindu voters who have migrated from the neighbouring country but also attract in particular the Matuas in favour of the BJP. At least on three previous occasions, PM Modi’s actions were linked to elections and they stirred a controversy. 2014 Lok Sabha electionsAn FIR was lodged against Modi, the then Gujarat chief minister and BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, on the instructions of the Election Commission for allegedly violating the election model code of conduct (MCC). After casting his vote in a booth in Ranip in Gandhinagar Lok Sabha constituency on April 30, 2014, Modi addressed a press conference outside the booth. While attacking the Congress, he was accused of taking a selfie with BJP’s election symbol 'lotus' and repeatedly displaying it. The Congress party approached the EC and complain that Modi had violated the MCC. On the orders of the EC, the crime branch police in Ahmedabad filed an FIR against Modi. Modi was booked under Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act. 2017 Gujarat assembly electionPrime Minister Modi had drawn criticism during the 2017 Gujarat assembly elections for flouting safety norms for travel of VVIPs. On November 14, 2017 - the last day of campaigning for the second phase of assembly election in Gujarat - Modi took a seaplane flight from the Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad to the Dharoi dam in Mehsana district. While the Kodiak seaplane that Modi flew in was a single-engine aircraft, safety norms require a Z+-protectee to travel in a twin-engine aircraft. Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said in a tweet: “How is it that the security guidelines were relaxed for this flight?

---||Kolkata||Cov change in voting in pandemic times||Midnapore: Till a decade ago, central forces conducting elections in the state would challenge anybody in the violence and political terror prone belt of Jangalmahal, for entering a polling booth wearing a mask. On Saturday morning, outside the Lohatikri High School on Dherua-Midnapore Road, around 15 kilometres from Midnapore town, security forces chased away a group of boys for not wearing their masks. It did not stop here. Every voter coming to cast vote was first told to queue up to get the temperature taken and wear masks before entering the polling booth. This assembly election in Bengal is shaping up to be one for the history books. Besides the emergence of BJP as an electoral force, turf wars and defections of politicians of all hues, the global pandemic has shaped several facets of voting in the state. Something like a mask, or a gamcha (a traditional thin, coarse cotton towel) which covers half of the face and used by many local residents to protect themselves from the sweltering heat in the region, was viewed by security forces with suspicion. But life has come a full circle in the “Red zone”. “I had thought the central forces might rebuke me for wearing mask while entering the polling booth, so I did not carry one. But I was shocked when three security personnel chased me and my friend away even before we reached the booth. They told us to wear the masks and come,” said Shantanu Murmu, a resident of Patnabazar in Midnapore Town. Voters will elect the 294-member legislative assembly in eight phases which started on Saturday with results to be declared on May 2. Election commission framed several guidelines for conducting polls during the pandemic including sanitisation outside the polling booths, availability of soap and water at polling stations and social distancing. On Saturday, TOI witnessed several poll commission officials outside the booths scanning temperature and handing over masks to voters. Outside every polling stations, election commission has deployed officials to scan the temperature of the voters before entering the polling booths and applying sanitisers on the hand. They were also handing over masks and gloves to those who did not carry with them. “Almost nobody has come wearing gloves and only 30% people wore their own masks. Most men came without wearing masks while most women wore their own mask,” said Nishita Pramanik, who was appointed by the election commission to hand over gloves and masks to voters outside the Chadra Higher Secondary School outside the Midnapore Town. Earlier, cops would chase away people hurdling outside polling stations. But this time special arrangements have been made for people to queue up to get their temperature scanned and get their hands sanitised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-change-in-voting-in-pandemic-times/articleshow/81728062.cms||Zeeshan Javed
