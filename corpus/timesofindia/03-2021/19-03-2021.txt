Addressing the media at the state Congress headquarters Rajiv Bhavan here, AICC general secretary Randeep Surjewala asked, "Why was the PM silent on the citizenship legislation? He termed the CAA “a conspiracy” to eliminate the identity of Assam." “Why do you want to harm the original identity, culture and civilization of Assam? Is Modi ji planning to implement this Act after the Bidhan Sabha election in Assam? Modi promised to implement CAA in West Bengal. On the other hand, they said their government will not implement CAA in Tamil Nadu but why is Modi ji silent in the context of Assam? Why this double standard?” Surjewala said. In a state, known for its culture, tolerance, moderation, goodwill and harmony, he said in the past five years, to quench their thirst for power in Assam, not only had BJP sown seeds of division, but also “attacked” the language and land of Assam through CAA. Among the 10 questions Congress hurled at Modi, one on development in chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal’s Majuli was at the top. “We remember the speech of Modiji on the world’s largest river island Majuli on March 26, 2016. He had appealed to the public to vote and they would build a bridge over the Brahmaputra. Today, we want to ask why there was no development on it. Now, on the eve of Assam assembly polls, why are they serving up lies by doing “bhoomi poojan” of the bridge from Majuli to Jorhat, which will cost Rs 925.47 crore?” Surjewala asked. The reports of 1,300 km of expressway on both banks of the Brahmaputra at Rs 40,000 crore raised expectations high among the people of Assam in 2017. The Congress leader, however, said on February 8, the Rajya Sabha disclosed that there was no proposal to build an expressway on the two banks of the Brahmaputra. Surjewala alleged that women’s safety was compromised during BJP’s rule in the state. “In the entire nation now, Assam is recognized as the most unsafe place for women. In the last three years, the women of Assam have fallen prey to 80,794 cases. BJP has made Assam the hub of child trafficking. Half of this type of crime happens in Assam only. How will you answer about the crime against women?” he said. “Modiji had promised people of the state that of the 63.25 lakh rural families, 59 lakh will get water under the Jal Jeevan scheme but after three years why are 56 lakh families still deprived of this scheme?” Surjewala wondered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-is-pm-silent-on-caa-in-assam-rallies-surjewala/articleshow/81576524.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Prime Minister Jean Castex said the tougher restrictions followed a clear acceleration in the spread of the coronavirus, with France now in the grip of a third wave. "The moment has come to go further, with more demanding restrictions where things are most critical," Castex told a news conference. The lockdown will be imposed on the 16 hardest hit departments, the prime minister said, including Paris and its surroundings, as well as parts of the north. It takes effect from midnight on Friday. Schools will stay open and people will be allowed to exercise outdoors within a 10 km (6.2 miles) radius of their homes. People living in these areas would not be allowed to travel to other parts of France without a compelling reason.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/frances-prime-minister-macron-imposes-lockdown-on-paris-as-virus-spreads-faster/articleshow/81576758.cms||---
---||India||Congress betting on its Chhattisgarh model to pull off upset over BJP||GUWAHATI: The Congress’s strategy for the forthcoming Assam elections takes a leaf out of its campaign for the 2018 Chhattisgarh elections. At that time too, the party had made several promises to the electorate, the most effective of which was farm loan waiver. But the strategy in Assam is on a different level as this time the party isn’t making promises but offering guarantees. And the chief architect of this is Naresh Arora of Mohali-based DesignBoxed, who was also the brain behind the Chhattisgarh campaign. Even without offering guarantees, the grand old party had managed to dislodge the 15-year-old Raman Singh-led BJP government in Chhattisgarh. So, the party is hoping that Arora’s magic would work in Assam too. The concept of a poll guarantee is new in India, and this seems to have been Arora’s suggestion to the Congress high command. The party’s national general secretary, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, later announced this at a rally in Tezpur. Arora, therefore, is likely to play a key role in finalising the Congress manifesto. While Arora didn’t speak to the media, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said the party’s guarantees are given by the top leadership and not ‘jumlas’. “It will surely surprise all pollsters and political commentators, just like the Chhattisgarh results. We are winning the elections. We will show that the target Amit Shah has set for BJP is going to be our tally — over 100,” Baghel said, taking a dig at the NDA’s claim of winning over 100 of 126 seats in Assam. Baghel is in the BJP stronghold of upper Assam as Congress observer. He has called in Arora and his team of experts there. Expressing confidence in the seven-party grand alliance called Mahajot, Baghel said the Congress coalition with AIUDF, BPF, regional and Left parties is “very strong”. “Together, we are defeating the BJP alliance convincingly. Plus, we are giving our voters what they need the most — no CAA, 200 units of free electricity, Rs 2,000 monthly income guarantee to homemakers, Rs 365 as daily wage to tea garden workers, and five lakh jobs,” Baghel said, adding that Congress will implement everything like they did in Chhattisgarh. The first phase of Assam elections is scheduled on March 27. And Congress is hoping to pull off a major upset over BJP. But saffron party has also pulled out its big guns, calling 20 star campaigners to the state, the most prominent of whom are Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, UP CM Yogi Adityanath, BJP national president J P Nadda, Assam CM Sarbananda Sonowal and key strategist Himanta Biswa Sarma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-betting-on-its-chhattisgarh-model-to-pull-off-upset-over-bjp/articleshow/81576181.cms||Kangkan Kalita

They embarked on a nature trail where they took to foraging for wild foods in the forest, which they cooked. What’s more, they also enjoyed a delicious meal in a mud house in a tribal village there. ‘It is through such activities that we get a cross-cultural conversation going’The group at a tribal house in Aarey Sanjiv Valsan, who conducted the walk there, elaborates, “The activity we did was more of an ecological as well as an eco-cultural workshop. We wanted to introduce city people to the ecologically-sensitive culture of the tribals of Aarey forest, using their indigenous forest food to build that bridge.” He adds, “Wild foods are central to forest-dwelling communities. They are ecologically important as they do not require water irrigation, deforestation, water or pesticides and at the same time, they give food that is superior in quality and taste. It also gives people an idea as to how skilled these tribal people are, so through such activities we have a cross-cultural conversation going. People also saw the mud architecture that exists in Aarey.” Flowers of the palash tree used to make herbal tea The group was introduced to various useful plants, roots, shoots, leaves and tubers in Aarey forest. They had tea that tribals make out of flowers of the Palash tree. The group also got to see a tuber that weighed 30kgs; it could feed a family for a week. Adds Sanjiv, “There’s a whole lot of remarkable plants, trees and flowers out there. It is more than what city people imagine it to be — apart from being a source of oxygen, they are also a source for medicine, craftsmanship, food and education.” At the end, they enjoyed a delicious, wood-fire tribal meal accompanied by vegetables, rice and millets that were grown in the Aarey forest. Exploring the Aarey forest’s wild menuMillet bhakri prepared on a wood fire and the tribal meal served on a banana leafThe day’s menu was one up on being innovative as it was delicious! Rekha Shetty, a participant, shares, “It was definitely a morning of learning for us. The trail was informative and opened us up to a lot of aspects in Aarey as we were not aware that so many wild foods were growing there. Everyone first had a quick breakfast of lemongrass tea and snacked on karanda, which is said to be the original Indian potato. We started early and spent half-a-day picking up wild foods. Finally, we sat down for a meal that was cooked for us. The ladies of Aarey made so many things — what was most interesting among them was a bamboo vegetable, a tuber called kon that grows here. Cooking it involves a lengthy process as the vegetable is quite long. They made a subzi out of it. We also had a dish out of nala bhaji, which is a green wild leafy vegetable that is grown wild in Aarey. The women also prepared bombil (Bombay duck) and aam chutney, both of which were delicious. They served all these delicious dishes with bhakris made of millets.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaikars-go-foraging-for-wild-foods-at-aarey/articleshow/81575188.cms||Ismat Tahseen

Also, New Delhi has given a boost to space ties with Quad countries — the US, Japan and Australia — in the last few weeks. Isro had held separate meetings or talks with Japanese space agency JAXA, Nasa and Australian Space Agency (ASA) recently to give push to several key programmes like joint lunar mission, earth imaging satellite programme (NISAR), navigation satellite and establishing a transportable terminal in Australia to help the Gaganyaan mission. On Wednesday, Isro chairman K Sivan and president of board of directors of the Saudi Space Commission, Prince Sultan bin Salman, led the space meeting on virtual mode. “Both had discussions on initiating space cooperation in areas of mutual interest. The possibility of concluding a country-level MoU for space cooperation was also discussed,” an Isro statement said. In December last, India’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ausaf Sayeed had held talks with Prince Sultan bin Salman in Riyadh to boost cooperation in remote sensing, satellite communication and satellite-based navigation projects. On March 11, Isro and JAXA agreed on collaborative activities for rice crop area and air quality monitoring using satellite data during a meeting between the Isro chief and JAXA president Hiroshi Yamakawa. The two agencies reviewed ongoing programmes in earth observation, lunar cooperation and satellite navigation, and also agreed to explore opportunities for cooperation in space situational awareness and professional exchange programme. Both space agencies are specifically working on sharing earth observation data and establishing Isro’s NavIC (India’s constellation of eight navigation satellites in space) reference station in Japan. Isro had on March 8 flagged off a key component of the joint Isro-Nasa SAR (NISAR) mission to the US to fast-track the earth imaging satellite project, which will help measure dynamic changes on the earth’s surface, natural resources and hazards. Isro had shipped the S-band synthetic aperture radar to Nasa’s JPL in California so that it could integrate it with its L-band radar and sent the module back to India for its launch, which is likely in 2023. Both agencies are also working for an implementing arrangement to carry Nasa’s Laser Reflectometer Array (LRA) in Chandrayaan-3 mission and exploring collaboration in the human spaceflight programme. On February 17, Isro and ASA signed an amendment of the ‘2012 India – Australia Inter-Governmental MoU for cooperation in Civil Space Science, Technology and Education’ in the presence of envoys from both countries. The amendment makes the Department of Space and ASA as executive organisations. Both sides also reviewed the status of activities in earth observation, satellite navigation, space situational awareness and establishment of the transportable terminal in Australia to support India’s first manned mission (Gaganyaan) to space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/space-diplomacy-india-plans-space-pact-with-saudi-pushes-key-projects-with-quad-nations/articleshow/81579050.cms||Surendra Singh

Responding to a written question in the Rajya Sabha, the minister to a question on whether the government has set any time bound targets to provide drinking water and sanitation facilities in all the schools said: “Education is in the concurrent list of Constitution and most of the schools are under jurisdiction of concerned States and UTs. States and UTs have been repeatedly advised to ensure that all the schools, including those under the non-government sector (private, aided schools, etc.) in their jurisdiction should have provision for separate toilets for boys and girls; and safe and adequate drinking water facilities for all children.” Times ViewThis is a distressing piece of statistics. Roughly 3% of the country’s GDP is spent on education. This is a compelling reason why it should be closer to the 6% generally considered the minimum needed.Quoting data from the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), he said, “As per UDISE, 2018-19, out of 10,83,747 total number of government schools in the country, 10,41,327 government schools have drinking water facility and 10,68,726 government schools have toilets,” he said in his written reply. The minister said that the department of school education and literacy has launched an integrated centrally sponsored scheme for school education — Samagra Shiksha from 2018-19, which subsumes the three erstwhile Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/42k-of-11-lakh-govt-schools-lack-drinking-water-15k-toilets/articleshow/81579059.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court panel on agriculture laws may support ‘legal guarantee for MSP’ demand||NEW DELHI: The SC appointed committee on farm laws may consider backing protection for MSP in its report with several unions, including those not agitating against the farm laws, pitching for stronger protection of a floor price. There are indications that the three-member SC-appointed panel may in its report speak favourably on the demand on MSP as most unions who appeared before it or submitted their views called for a legal guarantee to MSP to procure all crops. Though these unions had not objected to central farm laws, in their representations they are learnt to have told the panel that any decision pertaining to giving legal guarantee to MSP may end the agitation as the protestors would not like to return to their villages empty handed. Even RSS-linked organisations such as Bhartiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and Swadeshi Jagran Manch (MSP) too have publicly spoken in favour of legal guarantee to MSP, besides submitting their other suggestions to the government. The SC-appointed panel, which held its multiple internal meetings this week for finalising the recommendations, is expected to submit its report by March 20. Sensing all-round support on MSP, which is the only demand that can bind the farmers together for continuing agitation, one of the key farm organisation in the protest against farm laws, Jai Kisan Andolan (JKA), on Thursday launched ‘MSP loot’ calculator to show losses incurred by farmers. Though the government's figures show increase in procurement footprints this year during the ongoing ‘Kharif Marketing Season’ (KMS), the organisation led by Yogendra Yadav used the official data to clarify how the farmers actually incurred loss as they were forced to sell their crops much below MSP in different states including Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka. “The Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly said ‘MSP was there, is there and will be there’, but in the first 15 days of March as Rabi crops arrived at ‘mandis’, his (PM) claim has been busted,” said Yadav while releasing findings of the ‘MSP loot’ calculator which showed how farmers in many states lost Rs 140 crore in just one crop, Bengal Gram (chana), which arrived at markets during March 1-15 period. Terming it as the “loot of farmers”, Yadav said, “If the same trend of sale below MSP price continues and the government does not interfere, then in this year itself the farmers will be looted Rs 870 crores.” The details put out by JKA also show a significant dip in arrivals of Bengal Gram in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka compared to the average of last three years. The JKA will release daily data from every state, every market and every crop, showing how the farmers are forced to sell their crops at price below MSP. “Its purpose is to expose the false propaganda of the Modi government that farmers are getting the MSP announced by the Centre,” said Avik Saha, national convenor of the JKA. Meanwhile, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) – farmer unions’ platform spearheading the protest against farm laws – decided to oppose the Food Corporation of India’s (FCI) tighter procurement specifications for foodgrains. Besides setting higher quality standards for procurement of foodgrains, the FCI has also sought land records details to set up DBT of the price for procured grains. Thirty-two farm unions of Punjab on Thursday unanimously decided that the farmers in the state will not submit the land record related papers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-panel-on-agriculture-laws-may-support-legal-guarantee-for-msp-demand/articleshow/81579194.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Singh said an FIR should be lodged against the university official who was charged with calling up his women colleagues at late night. A call attention motion was raised in this regard by RJD MLC Sunil Kumar Singh and the acting chairperson issued these instructions while intervening during the government’s reply. Singh said the vice-chancellor of the university had allegedly allowed underground cabling work worth Rs 14 crore without the government’s approval and also purchased a machine worth Rs 86 lakh violating all financial norms. He said several employees were hired in a wrong way and given housing benefits illegally. Singh said one B S Beniyal, who has sexual harassment charges against him, was given undue favour. Animal husbandry and fisheries department minister Mukesh Sahni said the file related to the investigation will be sent to the governor in a week. Another RJD MLC, Ram Chandra Purbey, raised the issue of road accidents in the state. Replying to Purbey, transport minister Sheela Kumari said the government was taking all necessary steps to curb road accidents. She said of total deaths on the national highways in the state, 56% were because of high speed. She, however, added there has been 7.1% drop in deaths due to road accidents in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/probe-corruption-charges-against-officials-of-basu/articleshow/81575502.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Choudhary was responding to a call attention question of BJP member Sachchidanand Rai, who was the first to raise the issue on March 11. On March 11, the parliamentary affairs minister had said he would discuss the matter at the government level and then give his reply. Accordingly, the question was deferred for a reply on another date. Choudhary had also said the government had always felt that Sinha deserved to be bestowed with the Bharat Ratna. Revisiting the deferred question of Rai on Thursday, Choudhary said the state government has given a considered thought over the matter and has decided to make a formal recommendation to the Centre to bestow the country's highest civilian honour to Sinha posthumously. Given his role during the freedom struggle, his administrative acumen, singular role in the abolition of the zamindari system and industrialization of the state, among other qualities, Sinha deserved the award, Choudhary said. In the backdrop of the announcement made by Choudhary in the state legislative council, water resources department minister Sanjay Kumar Jha tweeted, “We are happy that the Bihar government will send a recommendation to the central government for the conferment of the Bharat Ratna Award to Shri Krishna Sinha, state’s first CM.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-to-recommend-bharat-ratna-for-its-first-cm/articleshow/81575467.cms||---

The victim, Sankar Sikdar, managed to hold on to one of the accused who was then nabbed by the police. The Beniapukur police later used CCTV footage and arrested the other accused from Topsia. The two have been identified as Md Sarfaraz alias Tipu and Md Shahrukh. Earlier, the Amherst Street police arrested a 30-year-old Narkeldanga resident — identified as Sk Armaan — after he stabbed an app-cab driver in the face while snatching his cellphone on Wednesday morning. In the incident reported from the Park Circus area, Sikdar was waiting at the signal in front of Islamia Medical Research Centre at the Park Circus crossing after exiting Maa flyover around 5.40pm. Two persons suddenly snatched the cellphone kept on his car’s dashboard along with his wallet that contained Rs 2,000. Determined not to let the youths flee, he leapt out of the car and gave chase before managing to grab Sarfaraz by the collar. The latter took out a razor from his pocket and slashed at Sikdar’s right hand, leading to a deep gash. But Sikdar did not let go of him. Sarfaraz’s associate Shahrukh managed to flee the area. Alerted by locals, police rushed to the spot and took Sarfaraz into custody. The razor blade was seized from him. During further investigation, raids were conducted at Topsia and Sharukh was arrested and the stolen mobile phone, along with the cash, was seized from his possession. Beniapukur police has lodged an FIR under IPC sections pertaining to voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery and robbery, or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt. Cops are probing if all three accused involved in the two separate cases belong to the same gang. In the incident reported on Wednesday, cab driver Ezhar Qureshi had dropped off a passenger and parkednear the Rajabazar tram depot. He had rolled down the window on the driver’s side when the accused tried snatching Qureshi’s phone. “As soon as the victim resisted, the accused attacked Qureshi with a knife. He made sharp cuts on the victim’s hands and face and left him in pain, bleeding profusely,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cpwd-man-chases-catches-snatcher-gets-slashed-with-razor-at-park-circus-crossing/articleshow/81576704.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Patna||Summer safety measures launched in all ECR divisions||PATNA: With a sudden rise in temperature, the East Central Railway (ECR) has launched summer safety measures in all its five divisions and chalked out a comprehensive plan to ensure safety on tracks and rail bridges. According to ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, the safety staff have been directed to carry out track maintenance work through regular inspection in order to avert accidents. The movement of trains is badly affected in the summer season due to track buckling that often results in catastrophic derailments. “The safety staff in all divisions have been told to ensure better upkeep of the loop lines that ease out train operations. They have also been asked to keep tabs on the condition of overhead wires at places from where a large number of passenger and goods trains pass frequently,” the CPRO said, adding that fire safety measures had also been launched. Besides, a special action force team, comprising senior officials, has been set up to detect any fault in tracks due to excessive heat in summers.

The financial contours of the ‘scheme’ is not known immediately. “The NCLT has approved the scheme submitted by Haldia Petro, which is keen to establish a Rs 50,000 crore petrochemical complex at Cuddalore. Only an oral order was issued on Thursday, approving the scheme. A detailed written order, outlining the details, is expected in a few days,” V Mahesh Kumar, official liquidator appointed by NCLT to liquidate the assets of NOCL told TOI. NOCL owed around Rs 9,800 crore to banks and other financial institutions. “The approval of the Haldia Petro scheme by NCLT will pave way for a Rs 50,000 crore petrochemical complex at Cuddalore and greatly help in economic revival of the region,” Mahesh Kumar said. Haldia Petro was among the three bidders, the other two being Accord Distillers and Brewers and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited. Accord withdrew from the bidding process. Nagarjuna Oil is a joint venture of Nagarjuna Fertilizers & Chemicals and Tamil Nadu’s investment arm TIDCO. It had planned to set up a 6 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) petroleum and oil refinery project in Cuddalore, in the eastern coast of Tamil Nadu nearly 200 km from Chennai, spread across 2200 acres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/haldia-petro-scheme-for-takeover-of-nagarjuna-oil-gets-chennai-nclt-nod/articleshow/81577134.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday ordered a ban on buses from Maharashtra from March 20, and asked officials to ensure 5 lakh people are vaccinated every day. The call for action came on a day the state’s Covid count shot up to 917 and the positivity rate was a worrying 5%. MP is vaccinating about 66,000 people on average daily in March. The state has the infrastructure to ramp it up to 5 lakh a day, but it will be quite a task, say officials. “Coronavirus is spreading its tentacles in the state again and it will have to be contained without hampering economic activities,” Chouhan said on Wednesday after a review meeting adding that the state should be ready to face tough measures ahead. Covid-19 protocol must be followed at workplaces, otherwise the government will have to take stern steps, he warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/vaccinate-5-lakh-people-every-day-in-mp-shivraj-tells-officials/articleshow/81577396.cms||---

The accused — Subhanjan Roy, Milton Ghosh, Abhijit Basak, Debojyoti Sarkar and Umesh Chandra Nath — were arrested while they were shooting a similar video with another unsuspecting woman at a New Town hotel. The woman was rescued and search is on for the rest of the crew. The complainant, a resident of Bongaon, had approached Bidhannagar cyber crime police station on December 28 last year alleging a private nude video — that she claimed was shot during an audition for a web series some months ago — had been uploaded on the site. Xvideos, where the clip was uploaded, is the most-visited porn site and is among the top 10 most-visited sites in the world. “We emailed the website and followed it up, after which they pulled the video down. We kept tracking the activities of the group. On Wednesday, we caught them red-handed,” said an officer. The complainant had said she had received a call last year from Roy, who introduced himself as film producer and offered her a role in a web series. “She was called to a New Town hotel and coaxed into shooting a nude video. The accused promised not to capture her face. But in December, she found her clip on the site and came to us,” the officer said. “The racket had been going on for a long time,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/five-held-for-selling-nude-video-of-woman-to-porn-site/articleshow/81576846.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad cops trap four selling tiger skins in Danapith||AHMEDABAD: A group of four persons selling tiger skins was held by the Ahmedabad city crime branch over two days. Four tiger skins were seized from three accused — Nailesh Jani, 55, a priest who stays in Gollimda, and his two aides Ranchhod Prajapati, 40, of Astodia and Alpesh Dholakia, 40, of Mandvi ni pol near Manek chowk. They were trying to find buyers near the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) office in Danapith on Wednesday and were caught from the spot. The fourth accused, Mohan Rathod, 40, resident of Gulbai Tekra in Navrangpura, was held on Thursday. A crime branch officer said Rathod had allegedly bought the tiger skins worth Rs 4 lakh from a man hailing from Karnataka at the local Gujari Bazaar around two years ago. He had then asked Jani, who was his friend, and his aides to find buyers for the skins. “They set a price of Rs 2.5 crore for the skins and approached some builders and other affluent people. An informer of the crime branch learned of their attempt and alerted police,” said a crime branch officer. Police then set up a trap to nab the accused. “Crime branch cops posed as buyers and met the accused who showed them the tiger skins and were caught red-handed,” said a police officer. The tiger skins have been sent to the forensic science laboratory (FSL) for further examination, he added. On the other hand, Gujarat forest department officials said the skins seized might be fake. “After examining the skins, we are of the opinion that they are not of tigers,” said a forest department officer. “However, the officials wanted to get it examined with the tiger expert of the department and also get them checked by FSL. We were recommended to send the samples to Wildlife Institute of India (WII) at Dehradun. If found to be genuine tiger skin, the WII officials will be able to identify the area from where the skins were poached,” added the state forest department officer. City crime branch has booked the four men under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and begun an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cops-trap-four-selling-tiger-skins-in-danapith/articleshow/81577562.cms||---
---||---||West Bengal assembly elections: BJP pits ‘stars’ to take on TMC veterans||KOLKATA: A gripping contest for seats is lined up for the assembly elections in Kolkata and the suburbs with political debutants—from the glamour world and legal field—set to take on seasoned politicians, including senior cabinet ministers. Rudranil Ghosh has been pitted by BJP to take on state power minister Sovandeb Chattopadhyay in Bhowanipore, actor Srabonti will slog it out against state education minister Partha Chatterjee, actor Parno Mittra will take on state minister Tapas Ray at Baranagar and footballer Kalyan Chowbey is pitched to battle it out against state minister Sadhan Pandey. Adding to the list of political debutants are oncologist Indranil Khan, who will contest on a BJP ticket against Trinamool’s Javed Ahmed Khan, lawyer Priyanka Tibrewal will fight in Entally as the BJP candidate against Swarna Kamal Saha if Trinamool and lawyer Loknath Chatterjee has got a ticket from the BJP to take on senior minister Subrata Mukherjee. Making it a three-cornered contest in Kolkata, the Left Front candidates bring in a dash of experience and youth in the looming fight for Kolkata. Rudranil admitted that it would be a tough fight in Bhowanipore. He said, “The party has given me a huge responsibility. The 2019 results have shown that the people of Bhowanipore had grievances and those complaints have only increased with time.” Ghosh even went on to claim his political opponent had been turned into a “political scapegoat”. Chattopadhyay declined to make any comment against Rudranil. “My fight is against the ideology of BJP. Whoever is their candidate is representing the BJP’s ideology. Thus, I shall fight against not an individual but the party. I started my political career from Bhowanipore in 1962.” Partha Chatterjee also chose not to say anything against Srabonti, but pointed out that he would remain focused on his work. “I have been serving my constituency over the past 20 years. I represent Mamata Banerjee, her party and the development she has brought in for the people of this state,” Chatterjee said. “A student who has studied for 20 years is not afraid of any exam. I am not concerned about my opponents because I have worked throughout my tenure and have been a regular in my constituency. The people trust me, my leader, and the party. The result will reflect people’s confidence in Trinamool.” Parno also conceded that it would not be an easy contest. “Honestly, as a first-time politician, every opponent is tough. I am nervous, happy, and excited. It’s a new phase in my life. I am elated that the party leaders thought I was worthy to be fielded in this seat,” she said. “All my life, I have lived in Salt Lake. But my father’s maternal side lived in Baranagar. As a child, I would often visit Sinthee.” Tapas Ray, her opponent, said, “I would have been happier if my opponent from the BJP was a political person. The BJP is now scrambling to find people who would want to contest the elections with their emblem. To project a chief minister candidate, they must find a face from Bollywood and to find a contestant against me, they are looking at Tollywood. It is indeed unfortunate to see that a political party can’t even find candidates.” The trend, however, takes a break in some parts of the city as well as on the outskirts. In Tollygunge, BJP MP Babul Supriyo will take the fight to Aroop Biswas, a senior state minister. In Jadavpur, Rinku Naskar, who defected from the CPM to BJP, will be in a three-corned contest with CPM legislative party leader Sujan Chakraborty, who was the winner of the 2016 elections, and Trinamool’s Moloy Majumdar. Bidhannagar will also see a high-voltage fight between Sabyasachi Dutta, the former mayor of the township, who defected to the BJP, with state fire minister Sujit Bose. Dutta has left his Rajarhat-New Town seat to take on Bose in Bidhannagar. Rajarhat-Gopalpur, which saw BJP taking a lead in 2019 Lok Sabha, has BJP heavyweight Shamik Bhattacharya in the fray against a Trinamool debutant, a devotional song exponent, Aditi Munshi. Rathindranath Chakraborty, also a former Howrah mayor, who defected to the BJP from the Trinamool, will take on cricketer Manoj Tiwari in Howrah’s Shibpur.

---||Business||Federal Bank plans to buy microfinance company to expand business||MUMBAI: Federal Bank MD & CEO Shyam Srinivasan has said that the private bank sees an opportunity to grow both organically and through acquisition. The bank is interested in acquiring a microfinance business as part of its focus on growing the retail high-margin category. Speaking to TOI, Srinivasan said that Federal Bank is now on a par with any new-generation bank in terms of digital capability and operations and had sound asset quality due to its focus on retail. “Financially we have done very well. There are some metrics around return on asset (RoA) expansion that we are targeting. This essentially means a change in margin profile,” said Srinivasan. Federal Bank had said that its RoA would grow from 0.76 to 1.25 in five years and were on course to achieve it, but Covid has delayed it by one year to FY23. The bank will also be launching its credit cards shortly and expanding personal loans. According to Srinivasan, in the banking sector, half the market is concentrated among the top 7-8 lenders. The remaining 50% is highly fragmented with 17-18 banks having a 1% to 3% market share, which throws up consolidation opportunities. “In Kerala, we have a 17% share, but the state is only 3% of the market. Outside Kerala, we are 1%. In the long term, I see a huge opportunity for growth and consolidation,” he said. Srinivasan said that Federal Bank has invested a lot in its platform and people, and now it was time to leverage the investment and capability. He said that to explore acquisition opportunities in microfinance, the bank would wait for a quarter as the current stand-still on the classification of loans as non-performing assets (NPAs) did not give a clear picture of asset quality. Srinivasan, who was hired from StanChart Bank in 2010, adopted a strategy of ‘digital at the fore, human at the core’, which meant upscaling technology, going slow on branch expansion but expanding their footprint by having more customer-facing employees. Federal Bank has also many fintech partnerships. It is about to launch two neobank partnerships that will enable it to get access to a new segment of customers for its personal loans and credit card products. In the last decade, the bank has raised capital only once through a Rs 2,500-crore qualified institutional placement in 2017. “We have been meeting our capital adequacy largely through internal accruals. This has led to a level of trust in the bank and, if Federal Bank comes to the market, there is good reason to believe that we will be able to raise the money,” said Srinivasan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/federal-bank-plans-to-buy-microfin-co-to-expand-biz/articleshow/81577268.cms||Mayur Shetty

Patna airport director Bhupesh CH Negi told this newspaper on Thursday that without the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s (DGCA) permission, remote flyers are not allowed to operate the drones within the 5-km radius of the airport premises or other places. The use of drones in Bihar usually caters to industries, law enforcement agencies and cultural activities including land survey, construction, collection of topography data, film, tourism, and other government initiatives, through high-resolution cameras, infrared sensors, facial recognition technology among others. For every flight, the remote pilot needs to take permission. The airport’s deputy general manager (air traffic management), Santosh Kumar said they can only ensure that no unauthorised drones fly in the vicinity of Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport to avoid any catastrophe. “While operating the drone near airport premises, one coordinator of the drone has to sit at ATC tower with AAI-Patna officials to ensure no disruption in flight movements at airport,” he said, adding they have no means to keep tab if any person flies the drone in any part of the state capital in an unauthorised way. Kumar said after taking permission from the DGCA, the drone operators have to take permission from the local administration- DM office or city SP to fly the drone within the airport periphery or other parts of the city. “The operators have to share their flying plan with the AAI Patna. Recently, we have got a flying plan of a land survey, which is a very big project of the government, starting from Uttar Pradesh to Bihar,” he said. As per the new drone rules, which came into force last Friday, drones weighing more than 250 grams can only be flown by a remote pilot with permission from the DGCA for every flight. The rules also specify a penalty between Rs 25,000 to Rs 5 lakh, depending on the offence committed. Divya Rawat, general manager of Atom Aviation Services Pvt Ltd, told this newspaper that they worked with both private and government agencies, for drone mapping for infrastructural projects. “Currently, we are using a drone for several works in Patna and other districts of Bihar. We provide services like topographical survey, land survey, DPR assessment among others. For each project we take permission from the DMs,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/flying-drones-illegally-may-cost-up-to-rs-5-lakh-in-bihar/articleshow/81576658.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Patna||Deadline for new ropeway at Rajgir extended again||BIHARSHARIF: The operation of new gondola ropeway to reach Vishwa Shanti Stupa atop Ratnagiri Hills at Rajgir has been further delayed. The much-awaited eight-seater cabin-like ropeway was expected to become operational in March this year. The initial deadline for the project was 2018. Tourism department secretary Santosh Kumar Mall, who inspected the project on Wednesday, said the new ropeway would start functioning as soon as the remaining works at the top and ground terminals are completed. Chief minister Nitish Kumar, during a spot inspection in December last year, had wished to see the new ropeway operational in January. The foundation for the project was laid by Nitish in 2015. Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES) was awarded the Rs 18-crore contract to construct the 191-metre safer detachable cabin-like ropeway by 2018. The cabins of the ropeway have been imported from Austria. As the project didn't get completed in 2018, Nitish rescheduled its inauguration on October 25, 2019 by President Ram Nath Kovind, when he opened fiftieth anniversary of the construction of Vishwa Shanti Stupa atop Ratnagiri Hills at Rajgir. The inauguration of ropeway by the President was deferred due to a rock that hindered the movement of the cabins during trial run on October 15, 2019. Lack of funds and Covid-19 pandemic further delayed the project. Once the new cabin ropeway becomes commercially operational, children below 10 years of age and elderly would also be able to enjoy beauty of nature by travelling in it to the Vishwa Shanti Stupa. The existing chairlift ropeway was gifted by Fujii Nichidatsu, a Japanese Buddhist monk and founder of the Nipponzan-Myohoji order of Buddhism, soon after the then President V V Giri inaugurated the Vishwa Shanti Stupa in 1969. Dr Radha Krishnan had laid its foundation in 1965. The existing ropeway with 101 chairs attached to it shot to fame when Devanand and Hema Malini had filmed the song ‘O Mere Raja’ for their film ‘Johny Mera Naam’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/deadline-for-new-ropeway-at-rajgir-extended-again/articleshow/81575767.cms||Farrukh Nadim

---||Lucknow||Not a single dose of ‘precious’ Covid vaccine should be wasted: UP CM||LUCKNOW: A day after PM Narendra Modi expressed concern over vaccine wastage in some states, chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed health officials to explore the reasons behind the wastage and undertake effective steps to prevent the loss. “Not even a single dose of the precious Covid-19 vaccine should be wasted,” the CM said in a review meeting with Team-11 on Thursday. Data from the health department showed that UP’s vaccine wastage was about 8.5%, which was within the accepted range of 10%. However, on Wednesday, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan had said that UP’s vaccine wastage was higher than the national average of 6.5%. The CM convened the review meeting after the PM urged the state government to ensure that there is zero wastage of the vaccine. Describing the Covid-19 vaccine as ‘precious’, the CM said: “We must ensure that not a single vial of vaccine goes to the bin. Good micro-planning can help achieve this, but exact reasons must be explored so that wastage in the state is below the national average,” he said. Officials said the wastage in UP is mainly linked to low turnout of people. Yogi directed that at least 45% of all Covid-19 tests in a district must be conducted through RT PCR method. In districts with high burden – about 15 in number – 50% of coronavirus screening must be done through RT PCR. He told the health department to keep Covid-19 hospitals ready in wake of the surge and increase surveillance and awareness activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/not-a-single-dose-of-precious-covid-vax-should-be-wasted-cm/articleshow/81578520.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The regulator is also considering the proposals of its panel which has recommended a business interruption cover. This will provide small businesses with up to 10 employees a minimum salary of Rs 6,500 for up to three months of a lockdown. Speaking at a CII virtual seminar on learnings from the pandemic, Irdai executive director Suresh Mathur said that the regulator is considering the formation of an Indian pandemic risk pool with contributions from the country’s insurers and reinsurers. A pandemic pool is required to cover such risks because international reinsurers do not provide pandemic cover. “As remote working becomes a norm, insurers can expect changes in the workmen and employee compensation products to include features like workspaces ergonomics and work-life balance for employees. The effect of Covid on general liability will vary industry-wise,” said Mathur. He added that this would also increase the demand for cyber insurance and further the evolution of cyber insurance products. Mathur pointed out that the lockdown had resulted in business interruption covers taking centre stage. He added that while there will be pressure on insurers to settle claims arising out of business interruption, the impact on companies will depend on policy wordings. Irdai had last year constituted a working group to explore the formation of an Indian pandemic risk pool. This was supposed to focus on risk to business continuity, reduction of stress on individuals and address the issue of migrant labourers. The working group had suggested that the pandemic pool should be through public-private partnership and the capacity (capital) would be through premium collections from insurers, Indian reinsurers and foreign reinsurance branches. “The product initially will cater to the micro and small to medium enterprises. We want a product where salary protection would be covered up to three months or an actual lockdown period, whichever is less. It is envisaged that Rs 6,500 per month for a maximum of three months can be covered for a maximum of 10 employees per MSME,” said Mathur. In the second phase, it could provide health insurance and enhancement of employees’ salary, and the third phase would include life insurance cover and higher salary cover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/irdai-sees-demand-for-new-covers-in-wake-of-pandemic/articleshow/81577407.cms||---

The traffic diversions should be in place from Saturday and the middle of the road as been freed for the next 10 days to facilitate the Metro work. According to the traffic plans, south- and east-bound vehicles headed for Basanti Highway will take the service road in front of Pragati Maidan fire station. Those from Basanti Highway will use the 10m-wide concrete road built by RVNL over the canal. “The traffic scheme worked out. There was no congestion during Thursday’s trials,” an officer said. Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), implementing the 32km New Garia-Airport Metro corridor, is set to launch the girders over the twin canals next to Basanti Highway, considered a challenging job . “Filling the viaduct from PC Chandra till the upcoming Ritwik Ghatak station has been a complex work, with girder launching starting a year ago. The next 150m gap till Ritwik Ghatak station will be filled in five stages. For the first stage, the 28m gap between piers 220A and 228 will be filled,” a senior RVNL engineer said. RVNL has launched 25 segments from piers 221 to 245. Tiljala traffic guard officers said the trial went off smoothly on the first day and the site would be handed over on Saturday. “We initially thought three days would be needed for the trials. But things went well and we can submit the report to DC, South on Friday. RVNL may start work from Saturday,” a traffic officer said. For the stretch at Basanti Highway, precast segments will be transported at night to the construction site and erected between the pillars with the help of launching girders. The viaduct spans can withstand heavy loads and gales or earthquakes. The main challenge is precision in casting and launching of girders that requires specialized cranes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/basanti-highway-diversion-trial-starts/articleshow/81576856.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

What makes the election in the constituency interesting is that it is for the first time in its history that two women candidates have been pitted against each other: Sitting MLA and LDF candidate U Prathibha Hari will be taking on UDF’s youngest candidate Aritha Babu, 27.  Kayamkulam has witnessed several historic contests, such as the one between G Sudhakaran and M M Hassan. Though Sudhakaran tasted victory in 1996 against Thachadi Prabhakaran, he was defeated in 2001 by Hassan by a margin of 1,764 votes. Sudhakaran blamed backstabbing by party supporters for the defeat. The vote margin between winners and runners up in Kayamkulam has always been very narrow. But in 2016, Prathibha Hari defeated UDF’s N Liju by a margin of 11,857 votes, highest majority recorded ever by any party in the constituency. Though Prathibha, who had carried out various development projects over the past five years, aims at improving the majority as CPM has given her a second chance, sources said it will be a challenge. The popularity of Aritha, who was elected to the Alappuzha district panchayat from Krishnapuram division at the age of 21 in her very first election, is definitely a challenge for LDF. Aritha, who had filed her nomination from Punnapra division of the district panchayat in the 2020 LSG polls, was asked to withdraw her nomination in the last minute by the party. However, she couldn’t withdraw her nomination on time and she garnered more than 1,000 votes without even having a proper campaign in the division. The candidature of Aritha, who had held official positions in the Kerala Students Union and Youth Congress, is well received among youngsters in the constituency, which has never seen young contestants in elections. LDF believes that Prathibha could outweigh Aritha’s popularity. The LSG poll results too were pro-LDF. But an issue that worries the LDF camp is the internal feud between the MLA and local DYFI workers. “Controversy had erupted when Prathibha made a scathing attack against the local DYFI leadership on her FB page in August 2020 for accusing her of not being active in party’s Covid-19 fight in the region. Even though the district leadership intervened in the issue, there has been a rift within the party. Moreover, Prathibha pulled herself back from the local body poll campaigns and it was not well received among party workers. The party leadership has sorted it out to an extent but how it would affect the polls is unclear,” said a source within the DYFI leadership in Kayamkulam. Eyeing the Ezhava votes, which play a major role in the constituency, NDA gave the seat to BDJS, which has fielded Pradeep Lal, union secretary of Kayamkulam SNDP Unit, as its candidate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kayamkulam-2-women-head-to-head/articleshow/81576189.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||Patna||Five key Bills passed in Bihar assembly||PATNA: The state assembly on Thursday passed five Bills, including the Bihar Lokayukta (Amendment) Bill, 2021, that provides to punish and fine people who file false cases before the Lokayukta seeking probe into matters involving the government officials. As per the Lokayukta Bill, if the Lokayukta finds that the complaint petition seeking probe into certain matter through the Lokayukta is on the basis of a false claim, the matter will be referred to the civil court, which will decide the punishment and fine. The guilty will face a fine of Rs 5,000 and a jail term for three years. The other four Bills which the assembly passed by voice vote in the post-lunch session were Bihar Tax Disputes Resolution Bill, 2021, Bihar Appropriation Excess Expenditure (1984-85) Bill, 2021, Bihar Municipality (Amendment) Bill, 2021, and Bihar Civil Court Bill, 2021. In consonance with the Municipality (Amendment) Bill, deputy CM Tarksihore Prasad said a state-level recruitment mechanism would be made to fill the posts of Group C staff in the urban local bodies since there is no uniformity made at the level of the local bodies and the process to fill the posts falling vacant has been making the functioning difficult. Further, the Bill prohibits the relatives of the councillors from seeking contract business from the urban bodies for the execution of work. The Municipality Amendment Bill will also prevent and clear encroachments made on the land of the urban local bodies. Earlier, the fine that was imposed on the encroachers was Rs 1,000, but it has now been increased to Rs 5,000 in case of temporary encroachment and Rs 20,000 in case of permanent encroachment, along with six-month jail term. As Bihar has become a full-fledged state, the government has repealed the Bengal, Agra and Assam Civil Court Act, and replaced it by the Bihar Civil Court Bill, 2021, that would now become an Act after its passage by the assembly and the governor’s assent to it. Deputy CM Prasad said the Bihar Tax Disputes Resolution Bill, 2021, will provide an opportunity to resolve 10,943 cases of tax disputes worth Rs 716 crore through the relevant rules pertaining to one time settlement (OTS) scheme and facilitate payment of Rs 118.75 crore to the state exchequer. The OTS scheme is for the settlement of tax dues pertaining to the period before July 1, 2017 when the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime came into force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/five-key-bills-passed-in-bihar-assembly/articleshow/81575476.cms||Abhay Singh

The RJD functionaries accused the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre of creating another Emergency-like situation in the country. RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari recalled the words of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and said, “Baba Saheb had warned that the society which will be influenced by hero’s worship will be ruined. Today, the same is happening in the BJP government, which is engrossed in Modi-bhakti, ignoring inflation, unemployment, corruption and atrocities on women. Another Emergency-like situation has engulfed the country and another J P Movement is the need of the hour.” Former health minister and Chhatra RJD patron Tej Pratap Yadav recalled the role played by his father Lalu Prasad during J P Movement. This was for the first time that such a symposium on J P Movement was held at the RJD office. Sources said the initiative was taken by the party’s state president Jagdanand Singh.

They were arrested during a special drive conducted by Dansaf as part of strengthening the enforcement activities ahead of the assembly polls. According to the police, the contraband, including 97 LSD stamps, hashish, ganja and Rs 7.86 lakh were seized from Augustine’s rented house at Chilavannoor. A laptop, several mobile phones, and a digital weighing machine were also seized from the house. As many as 618 LSD stamps and Rs 18,500 were seized from the house of Lawrence at Ayyappankavu. The police said that Lawrence is one of the drug peddlers.

The stamps were reportedly brought from Europe and the deals are made through dark internet and the payments are done using bitcoins. The police said that each LSD stamp is priced up to $3 in the international market but the retail drug sellers in the city sell it at a price of Rs 1,300 to Rs 1,500. According to the police, they arrested Amal and Akshay, who were suspected to be clients-cum-peddlers, initially based on a tip-off from their informers. Six LSD stamps were seized from them. Based on the information collected from them, police pinned down on the other two accused. The police said that the accused are suspected to be a part of an international network dealing with drugs. “Augustine has been working in the tourism sector at Kodaikanal and has allegedly used to smuggle in drugs to Kochi for years. We have launched a probe into his assets as we suspect them to have been created through drug smuggling,” said the police. The operation was supervised by district police chief (Kochi City) C H Nagaraju, deputy commissioner Aishwarya Dongre and narcotics cell assistant commissioner Thomas K A. The police said that they have strengthened the drug enforcement activities in the city based on the info that the drug peddlers are taking advantage of Covid-19 restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/four-youths-arrested-with-synthetic-drugs/articleshow/81576185.cms||---

Do they know what it stands for? Do they know who used to come there?” Banerjee said. “Coffee House is about Manna Dey’s immortal song. It is about free flow of ideas. Do they even understand these?” she said at a public meeting at Kalaikunda in West Midnapore. “While studying law and in my undergraduate days, whenever I used to go to College Street, I would drop in there. College Street and Coffee House are part of growing up in Bengal. Yes, we also did politics. But always outside, never inside Coffee House,” she said. “Will these outside goons, who have little respect for Bengalis and their culture, now force their way in? I know who led the fracas. He has been accused of several things in the past as well. I will not name him. I do not want to give free publicity to goons,” the chief minister said. “These outsiders are now packing hotels everywhere, threatening, and intimidating people. They have come to loot votes. Be very wary,” she said. The incident she referred to took place around 6.30pm on Monday, when a section of patrons claimed that a few alleged BJP supporters entered the main hall, and later while leaving, raised slogans of “Jai Shri Ram”. The patrons also alleged posters put up supporting the No-Vote-To-BJP campaign were also torn down. While cops at the Amherst Street police station claimed they had not received any complaint, the Coffee House authorities accepted there was sloganeering by a particular group of young men, “all dressed in saffron t-shirts and kurtas”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/do-they-know-what-coffee-house-stands-for-cm-slams-bjp-for-ruckus/articleshow/81577127.cms||Sujoy Khanra

The slain banker, Rishidev Kumar (38), was posted as a clerk at the Suryagarha branch of the bank in Lakhisarai. His body was found lying on the roadside along with his two-wheeler at Dhira. Initially, family members had rushed him to a hospital in Munger assuming he had met with an accident while returning home from the bank. It came to light that he was murdered several hours later only when police inspected the body and find a bullet injury on his back around 11 pm. Mednichowki police station SHO Rubykant Kachhap said she received information about an accident at Dhira around 8.30 pm. "A patrolling team was sent to the spot but by then Kumar’s family members had picked him up and rushed to a hospital. They had also removed the two-wheeler from the spot," she said. The SHO said doctors at Munger didn’t admit Kumar and declared him ‘dead’ after which family members brought the body back to the village. "Police went to Kumar’s house and found his body on the floor with heavy bleeding on the back. When the body was turned, a bullet hole was observed on the right side after which it became clear that he didn’t die of a road accident but was shot dead," she said. Kacchap said the police swung into action and took away the body for a post-mortem examination which was conducted on Thursday. She said a pellet was extracted from the body, but there were no eyewitnesses. She said Kumar’s first wife Nutan Mehta has been detained for interrogation as the prime suspect in the case. "However, she has not spoken anything yet," the SHO said. "Both started living separately almost seven years back due to marital discord. Kumar later filed a divorce petition on which judgment was expected soon. Five years back he remarried. The banker had kept the minor son born from his previous wedding with himself," SHO Kacchap said. Kacchap said Nutan was earlier posted as an accountant at Suryagarha primary health centre and the reason for the marital dispute was that Kumar suspected she had an illicit relationship. The SHO said police are waiting for a written complaint from the family members to register an FIR and take further action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/banker-shot-dead-in-lakhisarai-police-detain-estranged-wife/articleshow/81575552.cms||---

The theft at the temple in the Shukla Toli area under the Town police station was noticed around 4.30 am on Thursday when the head priest and a few others came to open the temple but found the locks broken. Temple management administrator Shambhu Dutt Shukla, an advocate, said the priest found the deity’s crown and shield stolen. "Both were of silver weighing around 4.5kilograms. They were worth more than Rs 4 lakh. They immediately informed me," Shukla said, adding, he rushed to the Town police station to inform about the theft. Shukla said the then Mauritius PM along with CM Nitish Kumar had inaugurated the renovated building of the temple more than 14 years ago. "The temple was originally built by our grandfather in 1901. The former Mauritius PM is our younger brother Ganesh Dutt Shukla’s disciple," he said. Town police station SHO Jaiprakash Pandit said police soon detained some youths based on Shukla’s suspicion. "One of the detained youths, Rohit Kumar, broke down and confessed to having passed on information to his associates for committing the theft," the SHO added. Pandit said on Rohit’s confession, police arrested another youth Pankaj Kumar from Nirala Nagar. "He confessed to having passed on the stolen ornaments to two others. The entire stolen valuables were finally recovered buried in the ground near the Malwalia canal under the Rampur Hatt police station area of Siwan. All recovery was made within four hours of theft coming to light," he said. SHO Pandit said Rohit used to visit his maternal uncle’s residence located just behind the temple and thus hatched a conspiracy to steal the ornaments with his associates. "Both arrested youths are aged around 21 years. Police are searching if they have any criminal antecedents," Pandit said. SHO said altogether four youths were involved in the theft and raids are on to arrest the other two.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/siwan-police-recover-stolen-ornaments-worth-rs-4-lakh-from-temple/articleshow/81576336.cms||Debashish Karmakar

There are also plans for a degree college and a law college, both on the St Thomas’ Kidderpore premises, Bishop Paritosh Canning announced on Thursday. All three colleges are initiatives of the Kolkata Diocese of the Church of North India (CNI). The management college will come up inside the sprawling premises of Bishop’s House on Jawaharlal Nehru Road and work is on to set up classrooms and libraries. Though the focus will be on hospitality management, a course on IT will also be run. The diplomas will be awarded by City and Guilds at the end of the one-year undergraduate programme. The diocese is in the process of applying for a no-objection certificate from the state, it was said. “We have been running many educational institutions in the city for ages and we consider it to be our forte. These days, management education is a sought-after stream, but most courses are expensive. So the church thought of starting this management college to focus on the less privileged and will hand-hold them into careers,” said Bishop Canning, the head of CNI in Kolkata. Bivas Saniel, principal of Scottish Church Collegiate School, has been given the responsibility to co-ordinate the setting up of the management college. The law college is in the planning stage, though space inside St Thomas Kidderpore has been identified. “It will not start from the next session since course planning and affiliation details with the Bar Council of India have to be worked out,” said John Ghosh, secretary of the diocese. The tech college on the Kidderpore premises will move to a new campus on B T Road and the space will then be used to set up the degree college, it was said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cni-to-set-up-colleges-for-general-law-mgmt-courses/articleshow/81576757.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

SP Ballia Vipin Tada said, “On getting specific inputs a joint team of Maniyar police and special weapons and tactics (SWAT) team had raided a cold storage in Gangapur township under the limits of Maniyar police station at 11 pm on Wednesday. During this raid, 2,496 bottles of Indian-made foreign liquor packed in 52 boxes and 460 bottles in a bag were recovered. One Sangam Yadav of Sukhpura area was arrested from the spot.” “During investigation, it came to light that the cold storage belonged to former MLA Manju Singh,” said Tada adding, “we are investigating the role of former MLA her family members and relatives in the episode. The course of action would be decided against them on the basis of outcomes of the investigation.” “During initial interrogation, Sangam divulged the names of his other gang members and said that they used to procure liquor from Haryana on cheaper price. The gang brings liquor consignments to Azamgarh and later stores it at different places in Bihar bordering districts in order to sell it in the districts of dry state at higher cost,” said police. “Other members of this gang are also being traced. Not only the smuggled liquor, but the recovery of empty bottles, wrappers and caps from the spot has indicated towards possibility of preparation of hooch there,” police added.

This resulted in a 585-point slide in the sensex, which ended at 49,217 points. Interestingly, the day’s selling came despite a Rs 1,258-crore net buying by foreign funds, with domestic funds net sellers at Rs 1,116 crore, BSE data showed. In the five consecutive sessions since the sensex’s March 10 closing of 51,280 points, the index is now down more than 2,000 points, or 4%. In intraday trade on Thursday, the sensex had even dipped below the 49k mark to touch 48,962 points from its earlier high of 50,296 — a drop of over 1,300 points. The day’s closing was the lowest since February 26. On the NSE, the Nifty closed 163 points, or 1.1%, lower at 14,558 points. Thursday’s selling also left investors poorer by Rs 2.6 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 203 lakh crore. And from its recent high of Rs 211.3 lakh crore, the market capitalisation is now down by Rs 8.2 lakh crore, official data showed. According to Sharekhan SVP and head (capital market strategy) Gaurav Dua, the domestic market continued to grind down despite opening in the green on the back of positive global cues at the beginning of the session. The sentiment was affected by the sudden firming up of bond yields in the US along with another day of surge in new Covid cases to 38,500 in India — the highest in the past four months, Dua wrote in a post-market note. Among the 30 sensex stocks, 21 closed in the red with Infosys, RIL and TCS together accounting for nearly two-thirds of the index’s loss. The day’s session also witnessed strong selling in mid and smallcap stocks, BSE data showed. The current weakness in the market could continue. According to Religare Broking VP (research) Ajit Mishra, with all the major events behind us, global cues and Covid updates will dictate the trend. “Nifty tested the critical support at 14,500 points (on Thursday) and its breakdown will pave the way for further decline. Traders should maintain extra caution and limit leveraged positions,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-yields-sink-sensex-by-2k-pts-in-just-5-sessions/articleshow/81577346.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||A year of corona: All now run equal risk of Covid mortality||Ahmedabad: A year ago when coronavirus pandemic held Gujarat hostage to unprecedented disease and death, it was believed that the elderly and those with comorbidities having pre-existing illnesses like diabetes, obesity, heart disease etc were at a higher risk of succumbing to the viral infection. Analysis of 4,427 deaths in Gujarat from beginning of the pandemic last March 19, 2020, till March 16, 2021, has revealed that Covid-19 currently keeps no such differentiation based on the comorbid conditions. In fact, 49% of the 4,427 deaths had single or multiple comorbidities. Against this, 51% people who died had no comorbidities with 23% having no risk factors as well. According to the state health department officials, the international norms identify age, race, gender, etc. as risk factors. “If we see Gujarat’s analysis of the deceased patients, we see that over half the deaths (53.1%) have been recorded in 50-79 years age group. In fact, 60% or six out of every 10 deaths recorded in Gujarat are from the patients above 50 years of age,” said a state health department official. But change is apparent when one compares the first five months of the pandemic with the rest – while almost all other categories have witnessed a dip, the 18% rise is recorded in ‘no comorbidity with risk factors’ group – from 10% to 28%. The experts point at age as a major risk factor as major reason due to relatively lesser resistance to the viral infection. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Atul Patel said that the local trend is in synch with those witnessed in the US where younger people are now succumbing to the virus. “The biggest trigger for deaths in health or patients with comorbid conditions is the fact that Covid-19 triggers immune dysregulation which makes leads of uncontrolled inflammations turning the body's immunity against itself. This can prove equally risky in healthy patients," said Dr Patel. He said that subject to availability of the Covid-19 vaccine, it should be opened for all to safeguard larger population against the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/a-year-of-corona-all-now-run-equal-risk-of-covid-mortality/articleshow/81577552.cms||Parth Shastri

A former district board member, Dayanand was gunned down by armed assailants near Sirisia Chowk under the Naurangia police station area in West Champaran district on February 14. His wife, Kumud Verma, had accused the legislator of hatching a conspiracy to kill Dayanand. The state in-charge of the Congress, Bhakta Charan Das, told mediapersons on Thursday that the ruling dispensation was shielding the lawmaker and those involved in the crime. “We will fight in the House and outside to ensure justice to the party worker’s family,” he said. In the FIR Kumud claimed that Rinku and Shakeel Miyan of Valmiki Nagar, who had a heated argument with Dayanand near Sirisia Chowk, said they would teach him a lesson. One suspect in the case, Bablu Jaiswal, was caught by a mob when he was fleeing from the spot. Bagaha SP Kiran Kumar Jadhav told this newspaper over the phone, “Three people, including two named accused, have already been arrested and sent to judicial custody.

---||Ahmedabad||‘Will boost prey base outside Gandhinagar’||AHMEDABAD: The forest department is planning to develop the prey base around the capital city for wild animals in order to keep them away from human habitat. The department said so in an affidavit filed in the Gujarat high court. The chief conservator of forest, wildlife circle, Junagadh, D T Vasavada, has filed an affidavit in response to a PIL demanding a comprehensive plan for conservation of wildlife, especially the Asiatic lions, as expansion in wildlife habitat has been witnessed of late. The PIL cited a November 2018 incident of a leopard entering the Sachivalaya campus in Gandhinagar and the petitioners claimed that wild animals roaming in the city highlighted how the government has failed to manage the expansion of wildlife outside the protected areas, especially the Gir National Park and Sanctuary, as the Asiatic lions have spread out. In reply, the affidavit reads, “I say that the areas round Gandhinagar has good vegetation and has sufficient water availability due to which wildlife is attracted. The forest department is aware about such issues and is taking up mitigating measures such as developing prey base in the vegetated area around Gandhinagar.” The PIL accused the forest department of using force and caging animals every time when human-animal conflict is reported. The department has denied these allegations In response to other contentions raised in the PIL, the department said that it has plans in place for each of four national parks and 23 sanctuaries spread over 17,330 sq km, which is 8.9% of total geographical area of the state. It also stated that the department has created new wildlife divisions to manage the increasing numbers of wildlife and cited examples of Girnar sanctuary and Shetrunji wildlife division. The forest department asserted that the plan for Gir sanctuary was approved by the authorities in 2012 and the plan for conservation of all species and preserving the ecosystem was prepared by the serving officers. The programme has yielded good results and the conservation project has been appreciated world over. The forest department has said that it is well aware that due to increase in wildlife, the presence of animals can be found outside protected areas and it is taking action to meet the new situation. The department has incorporated fully scientific and technical approach for wildlife management and its officers are fully competent and skilled to undertake the tasks at hand. It said that there are seven satellite populations of lions outside Gir. Barda is also cultivated and developed as an alternative home for the lions. Three gene pool populations are developed at Barda in Porbandar district, Rampara in Morbi district and Sakkarbaug in Junagdh for breeding lions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/will-boost-prey-base-outside-gnagar/articleshow/81576987.cms||---

---||Patna||Nitish, Tejashwi row over liquor smuggling likely to die down after CM’s intervention||PATNA: The recent uproar in the state assembly over the alleged involvement of cabinet minister Ram Surat Kumar in liquor smuggling that even led to a faceoff between CM Nitish Kumar and the leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, is likely to die down after the CM’s intervention. Clarifying on the liquor smuggling issue, Nitish said, “The revenue and land reforms minister has explained that he has no ties with his brother, and the division of his father's properties was executed much earlier.” Moreover, Nitish pointed out that the minister had never said that action should not be taken against those, including his brother, found responsible in the matter. The CM's reaction came following Tejashwi’s concerted attack against Kumar, a two-term BJP MLA from the Aurai assembly constituency in Muzaffarpur district. “There is no point in raising the controversy again when CM has already clarified his stand on the issue. The CM’s statement is based on facts. Moreover, he appears to be satisfied by the minister’s reply in the House on the contentious issue,” a senior BJP leader said, requesting anonymity. Tejashwi had launched a frontal attack on Kumar, the revenue and land reforms department minister, both inside the House and outside alleging that the minister was directly involved in the illicit liquor trade. He also led a march to Raj Bhavan and threatened to gherao the CM’s residence if no action was taken against the minister. He had also demanded that the school from where liquor was seized in November last year be converted into a police station like it was done recently in another case of liquor seizure where the seized building was turned into a police station. The RJD leader didn't stop there and called Nitish 'weak' and 'helpless'. He also tweeted, “The CM is openly trapped in the liquor smuggling scandal, his minister is misleading the entire state. We have disclosed the exploits of the minister, including evidence. Even after the revelations, will the CM still save his minister for the sake of the chair?” Minister Kumar had earlier told the media that he had not been in touch with his brother Hans Lal Rai since the division of property among the brothers in 2012 through the court. He, however, admitted that he had visited the school named after his late father Arjun Rai on several occasions. The minister further clarified that Hans Lal had purchased the land on which the school was built with his money and subsequently leased it out to somebody else. “Even then, if he is found guilty, action should be taken against him,” Kumar told the media. As the controversy gained ground, the Muzaffarpur police accelerated the investigation into the case. Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant said the investigating officer has moved the special prohibition court to obtain an arrest warrant against 10 accused, including Hans Lal Rai. The SHO of Bochahan police station, Rajesh Ranjan, said five out of 15 accused got arrested. On the night of November 8, 2020, police had seized 516 cartons of Indian made foreign liquor and arrested three people. Later two others were also nabbed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-tejashwi-row-over-liquor-smuggling-likely-to-die-down-after-cms-intervention/articleshow/81575537.cms||Ramashankar

Caveat: they all hope that there is no second wave of the pandemic. While Club Mahindra has launched six resorts over the past six months, billionaire Prem Watsa-backed Sterling Holidays is adding four properties over the next three months after it launched its Rishikesh resort last November while Shruti Shibulal’s Tamara leisure group is opening one in Alleppey and lined up three more under ‘Lilac’ besides looking to aggressively add more locations. “The B-Leisure (Business+Leisure) is pushing growth. We will achieve 80% plus occupancy in March and the season ahead looks promising. (Last March the chain’s occupancy rates were 72%). With more people wanting to spend outdoors, our resorts are packed. We hope there is no second wave which will restrict movement,” said Kavinder Singh, CEO of Mahindra Holidays. “If the current momentum continues, the upcoming summer will be very good. We see people vacationing more within India over the next 3-5 years,” he added. Agrees Tamara’s Shibulal. “The bounce back on leisure travel has been very strong. We did not foresee such strong bounce back. Our Coorg and Kodaikanal properties are full,” she said. With the buoyancy returning, Tamara group is opening an Ayurvedic resort in Alleppey next month and lined up three, one each in Guruvayoor, Kannur and Kumbakonam under its budget brand Lilac. “We are seeing good opportunities to acquire properties. Some of these assets are cheaper today than what they were a year or two back,” she added. Sterling Holidays, which opened its resort in Rishikesh last November, is in final stages of negotiations to launch three properties over the next 3 months. “We are hoping that there is no second wave. Kerala market is a point of worry. From what we were, we are definitely much better and we remain cautiously optimistic,” said Ramesh Ramanathan, CMD of Sterling Holidays India. People who are travelling are spending more time on food and holidays. “Our average stay which was three days earlier is now 4.5 days and it has become a mix of work and leisure as many people still are on the WFH mode,” Mahindra’s Singh added. He also said that vacationers prefer driving down instead of public transport. “It’s not just our resorts, even our car parks are full,” Singh added. “We are looking to expand in Western and Eastern India aggressively.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/resort-owners-gear-up-for-summer-rush/articleshow/81577201.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

While 48 people got discharged, active cases increased to 541.If the current spike in cases turns into a wave, it could be serious than the previous waves in terms of death rates and the number of cases requiring hospitalization, epidemiologists warned. The new spike is expected to infect more vulnerable people either with co-morbidities or senior citizens as restrictions on movement have been removed.A study of the Covid-19 daily figures shows that fresh cases have been rising by 10% to 25% daily and has doubled in the last one week. But health officers said the spike cannot be considered a wave. “Only if figures reach at least 50% of our earlier highest figures, which was 650 cases a day, can it be considered a wave. This is a spike, and we are controlling it,” deputy director of public health Dr G Ramesh Kumar said.Epidemiologists, however, said the rate of increase in cases shows that a new wave is imminent. “Any flu or virus will keep returning in waves until every pocket is immune and the geographical space reaches herd immunity. In Coimbatore’s case, proximity to Kerala, where cases are high across districts including Palakkad, is also a factor,” said former director of public health Dr P Kulandaisamy. “This wave is likely to be deadlier because it will reach deeper into the community and infect the vulnerable people, needing a higher proportion of active cases to require hospitalization and even higher death rates,” he said.When the virus initially began spreading, men were infected in higher proportions than women as they were the ones stepping out, said Kulandaisamy. “By the second half of last year, women began getting infected in equal proportions. Now, in the overall data for Tamil Nadu, the male to female ratio among infected is almost equal.”The only way to prevent a new wave and avoid hospitalizations is vaccination, said city health officer Dr S Raja. “People must get vaccinated in large numbers to protect themselves and vulnerable people around them,” he said.In the last 10 days, 62,466 people got vaccinated in the district, including 6,354 people on Wednesday. Considering the district’s population of 36 lakh people, the numbers are still low, experts said. “If the corporation’s population is 18 lakh, all eligible sections must get vaccinated within three months for it to be effective,” Raja added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/experts-warn-of-second-covid-wave/articleshow/81577400.cms||---

Each team comprises a doctor, nurse and junior health inspector. District collector S Suhas inaugurated the mobile vaccination facility. “Out of the around six lakh elderly population in the district, one lakh received first jab. The district has planned to inoculate all the elderly population with first dose in one month,” the collector said. In the first phase, all inmates of old age homes in the district will be inoculated. Later, vaccination will be extended to other elders with the support of residents’ associations and other organizations. Meanwhile, five more mega vaccination camps started functioning in the district on Thursday. Aluva district hospital, which has been modified to treat tertiary care Covid patients, will start receiving category B patients from Monday. Though authorities planned to shift the tertiary care treatment from Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Ernakulam, to Aluva last month itself, it got delayed as a transformer was to be installed at the hospital. Patients in the Covid apex centre at PVS Kaloor will also be shifted to Aluva. The infrastructure facilities bought for treatment of Covid patients will also be shifted to Aluva hospital. “The ICU facility with 20 beds will be retained in the MCH for treatment of Covid patients. Covid ICU is mandatory in all government MCHs. Rest of the patients will be shifted to Aluva. It will take 10-15 days to admit critical patients as we have to be confident of the system. After that admission of category C patients will start,” said a health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mobile-vaccination-facility-launched/articleshow/81576193.cms||---

We have seen such things. They cannot deter us by such tactics,’’ he said.Kamal commenced his campaign stating that one thief should not be the alternative for another thief and urged the people to vote for MNM candidates who have a clean track record. “Media reports say 33% of MLAs have criminal cases. You must choose honesty as an alternative to this kind of group,’’ he said.Giving a clean chit to all his functionaries, Kamal said that he would be the first person to pull up his functionaries if they commit any mistakes. “I will question them. They are answerable,’’ he said.Earlier, talking to reporters in Coimbatore, he said politics could be the reason for the raid and said he would wait for the authorities to explain the reason for the searches. “Let them explain why. Then I would respond,” he said.To a query on delays he faced in obtaining permission for helicopter landings, Kamal said that there were hurdles thrown at him for three years to scuttle his movement and interaction with the public. “I don’t need a helicopter. It is to reach as many places and people in a short time that I use the helicopter,’’ he said.Kamal said that MNM’s election manifesto was ready and he was waiting for other parties to release them before MNM could do so. “We have learnt that our manifesto should be released after everyone else does,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/i-t-raids-on-mnm-treasurer-politically-motivated-kamal/articleshow/81577395.cms||---

The Jamnagar police with the help of UK law enforcement agency first stopped Patel’s extortion income, which left him financially distressed. This also forced the three contract killers, whom he had hired to eliminate advocate Kirit Joshi in 2018, return to India and they were arrested in Kolkata by the Jamnagar local crime branch. Patel used to send them Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh as expenses while being on the run every month through hawala channels. The killers, Hardik Thakkar, Dilip Thakkar and Jayant Gadhvi, were caught few days ago. In fact, when they left Senegal where they had fled and got stranded due to lockdown, they had only enough money to buy flight tickets to India, said police. The team led by Jamnagar superintendent of police Deepan Bhadran, who was tasked with breaking this dangerous crime nexus, started by collecting technical data. They traced the mobile applications through which Patel’s victims got extortion calls which were made using voice over internet protocol (VOIP). Police gathered these IP addresses. Cops then invoked the India-UK Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) which helped them seek details of Patel’s movements as well as details of IP addresses which he was using to communicate with his gang members and family. The investigators were already following the money trail from Jamnagar to London and Patel was collected extortion money through various illegal channels. Police then traced some people through whose accounts Patel was getting the money and found that most of them were in the UK.

The report says that the discharge of effluents through the drainage creates a lot of social and environmental problems. There is no onsite or offsite oil spill contingency plan for TTP Ltd. The company has an overall production of 40 to 45 tonnes of titanium dioxide per day. Around seven different types of chemicals were produced from TTPL. Around 1,000 employees (600 permanent and 400 temporary staffs) are associated with TTPL. So, in case of an oil spill, there is no existing contingency plan developed by TTPL. Proper checking of in and out pipelets was delayed by the company, the report says. As per the field inspection by a three-member team of SDMA for the assessment, the furnace oil leaked from TTPL is in the grade of class 3 oil types. Around 4,750 litres of furnace oil is estimated to have been leaked into the sea and beach following a rupture in the pipeline transferring furnace oil from 60KL storage tank to boiler. The report points out that the effluents from the factory are carried away by the existing drainage which opens directly to the sea. It should be checked whether the effluents are treated or not and whether they satisfy the legislation and norms of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board, it notes. Explaining the environmental impact of oil spill on water and soil, the report mentions about formation of a substance called mousse.The chemical composition of oil mixes with the water and creates a new substance known as mousse. This mousse becomes even more sticky than oil alone, causing it to stick to organisms and materials much more readily. Mousse resembles food for several animals and attracts certain curious birds and marine life. For people attempting to clean the slick, the oil-water mixture is extremely hard to dispose, according to the assessment report. The hazard vulnerability assessment report prepared for Thiruvananthapuram by SDMA in 2016 stressed the need for formulation of an oil spill contingency plan for the coastline in the district. The report had however focused more on causes arising from increased coastal transport owing to the upcoming Vizhinjam International Port. No possibility of oil spill was anticipated in the report pertaining to TTPL and the report mainly mentioned industrial hazard due to effluent discharge at TTPL. The oil leak happened in February. The sand was contaminated over a distance of 4.5km to the north of the discharge point. SDMA report also shows that the existing drain of TTPL was found to be clogged and solid waste was not segregated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sdma-for-contingency-plan-at-titanium/articleshow/81576204.cms||Aswin J Kumar

He said that party workers interact with the public and highlight the failures of Yogi Adityanth-led state government including issues like hike in petrol prices and the grievances of farmers. Tiwari was addressing Congress workers from trans Ganga and trans Yamuna areas at the district Congress office on Zero road here on Thursday. He arrived at the party office to review the preparations of panchayat polls. “Part workers have been asked to expose the underperformance of the Yogi government on several fronts. The state government has completely failed on the law and order front. As a result, there has been a steep rise in cases of rape, murder and loot. The CM has also failed to tackle inflation. Moreover, rising unemployment has also compounded the woes of youths in the state,” said the senior Congress leader. “Since the prices of petrol and diesel have surged, all essential commodities have become expensive and it has created a dent the pockets of citizens,” he added. Tiwari further said that Congress has managed to strengthen its organizational structure with the help of Srajan campaign at the panchayat level. The party candidates would be victorious in upcoming panchayat elections, he added.  Congress including Haseeb Ahmad, Munkund Tiwari, Suresh Yadav, Sudkhar Tiwari, RC Mishra, Talat Azeem, Alpana Nishad and others were present in the review meeting on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/congress-to-contest-panchayat-polls-with-full-strength-pramod-tiwari/articleshow/81576199.cms||---

AAI officials said that complacency has set in among passengers, with many seen wearing their masks below their chin or removing their PPE gown aboard flights. AAI authorities and airlines plan to step up compliance at airports, a move that comes even as Covid-19 cases increase in Goa. “Passengers feel that Covid-19 has gone. A sort of complacency has set in,” said an official at Goa International Airport. AAI officials at the Dabolim airbase made an earnest appeal to all passengers last week to wear masks at all time and to comply with the latest guidelines issued by the director general of civil aviation (DGCA). “AAI has put up sign boards at every location, urging passengers to wear face masks and to frequently sanitise their hands. The airport is also making frequent announcements asking people to comply with safety directions,” said airport director Gagan Malik. Malik said that right from the beginning, AAI has been strict about wearing masks and frequent sanitisation within the airport terminal. On March 15, AirAsia India offloaded two passengers from its Goa-Mumbai flight for not wearing PPE gowns before take-off. As per guidelines, passengers in the middle seats have to wear a PPE gown. On Tuesday, another passenger on an IndiGo flight from Delhi to Goa created a fuss about wearing the PPE gown and was handed over to the police on arrival in Goa. The airlines have also filed police complaints against the passengers. In light of these cases, AAI has stepped up vigilance. “From all sides we ensuring strict compliance,” said Malik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-airport-urges-flyers-to-comply-with-covid-norms/articleshow/81578563.cms||---

This is in addition to the Rs 15.57 crore already sanctioned for the purpose. The government has sanctioned 2.30 acres for the project last month.As per the order sanctioning the funds issued by the public works department (PWD), since there is no budgetary provision for the project in the ongoing financial year under the head from which funds have been granted, the government has instructed chief engineer PWD (buildings) to forward a proposal for additional authorization. The order issued by the PWD department has said that additional funds can be authorized in this case subject to the condition that the housing department should limit the expenditure under this demand.The government has already constituted a committee of secretaries chaired by additional chief secretary (revenue) A Jayathilak to supervise and take relevant decisions for the construction of the residential complex.The committee includes KSIDC managing director M G Rajamanickam as special officer (IAS residential complex), and also includes secretary (PWD), secretary (general administration), secretary (finance- resources), chief engineer (PWD- buildings), chief town planner and two other IAS officers with a background of civil engineering. The special officer will have the financial and administrative powers of a head of the department.The committee has been entrusted with the task of selecting the architect, finalization of design — both interior and exterior, award the contract, monitor the construction and frame the rules for allotment of the residential space to the officers and its maintenance.The revenue department had on February 5 issued an order allotting 2.30 acres in two separate plots for the project.

---||Delhi||Javadekar must quit for failing to curb pollution: Bharadwaj||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party’s chief spokesperson, Saurabh Bharadwaj, on Thursday called for the removal of Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar citing the World Air Quality Report 2021 prepared by Swiss organisation IQAir, which says 22 of the world’s 30 most polluted cities are in India. Referring to the report, Bharadwaj said that of the top 10 polluted cities in the world, eight were from India, and of those eight cities, the majority belong to Bharatiya Janata Party-run Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. He said Delhi government had taken multiple steps, which had brought the national capital down to the 10th most polluted city as opposed to the most polluted one earlier. Bharadwaj said how the Centre washed its hands of any responsibility towards controlling pollution, conveniently putting the blame on Delhi. The Centre’s own report had stated that Delhi’s pollution reduced by 25% and that PM2.5 levels reduced as well but the central government doesn’t wish to talk about it, he claimed. Delhi’s 300km radius has 13 thermal power plants with outdated technology and are a direct source of pollution to Delhi, he added. Bharadwaj alleged that Javadekar was directly responsible for 22 cities of India featuring among the 30 most polluted in the world and should be removed with immediate effect and a person who knew and understood the importance of environment should be made the environment minister. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said Bharadwaj was behaving like a failed school child telling his parents that he was not the only failure in the class but nine other students had failed too. Terming the behaviour “childish”, Kapoor said AAP should concentrate on Delhi and first set up an expert committee to study the causes of pollution and suggest remedial measures. He said Delhi needed to launch a five-year strategic campaign against dust and fuel pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/javadekar-must-quit-for-failing-to-curb-pollution-bharadwaj/articleshow/81577415.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It further asked the state as to when it would initiate the process of election to constitute the board. It also directed the appearance of a special secretary level officer before it on March 25 in order to assist it in the matter. A division bench of Justice DK Upadhaya and Justice Manish Kumar passed the order on a writ petition moved by one Asad Ali Khan. The petitioner’s lawyer Abhinab Singh pleaded that there was no provision under the Waqf Act 1955 and the rules framed there-under for appointment of any administrator in the board in case the elections could not be held on time. In course of hearing, the bench found that last election of the board was held on May 19, 2015, for a term of five years and the term of the elected body expired on May 19, 2020, but subsequently the election could not be held to constitute new body due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

---||Goa||Despite corporation tag, City of Panaji lacks powers, service delivery||PANAJI: There are 97 candidates vying for the 30 Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) council seats and as the poll date nears, they are dishing out promises left right and centre. From hop-on-hop-off buses and free parking to a new market complex and revitalisation of St Inez creek, everything under the sun is being promised. Leave aside the fact that these are old promises, the question is, does the CCP have any powers. The capital city, once administered by the Panaji Municipal Council, got the more glamorous ‘corporation’ tag courtesy of the City of Panaji Corporation Act, 2002. However, citizens say it hasn’t done any good. Residents say the corporation tag has led to an increase in taxes with no tangible increase in civic services. The services that the city provides today are no different from those provided by Class A civic bodies such as the Margao Municipal Council and the Mormugao Municipal Council. “We do not see much difference with the CCP and if we were a municipal council maybe much more could have been done,” Campal resident Armando Gonsalves said, while suggesting that CCP should revert back to a municipal council. “In terms of governance, CCP is a total failure on all fronts.” Presently, CCP collects garbage and cleans storm water drains, akin to what is done by the other municipal councils in Goa. In contrast, the municipal corporations of Vellore, Tumakuru and even Belagavi provide water supply, sewerage connections, operate health care facilities and educational institutions, and even property registration and mutation. Some of these services were envisioned by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar when he upgraded the capital from a municipal body to a corporation, but the reality is far different. “CCP was a residue of a failed exercise, wherein it was supposed to be a 50-member corporation which included large tracts of Porvorim, Penha De France and Santa Cruz. It is a residue of a stunt by the former chief minister, Manohar Parrikar, where he tried to delink Taleigao,” Elvis Gomes, former director of municipal administration, said. When the City of Panaji Corporation Act came into force from January 21, 2003, it was meant to provide for and constitute a municipal corporation for a larger urban area for the Panaji municipal area and other developed areas. Schedule I of the Act includes the whole of Panaji municipal area, and the villages of Taleigao, St Cruz, Penha da Franca and Bambolim, excluding the military area. Shrill political protests forced Parrikar to drop the idea and retain the erstwhile jurisdiction of the Panaji Municpal Council. Gomes, who also served as a municipal commissioner of CCP, said that one of the main reason why CCP failed to live up to expectations is because it lacks administrative powers. “Whether it is the Congress or the BJP, they have been reluctant to bring structural reforms, to delegate powers to civic bodies. Right from the time of JNNURM (Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission), the major focus on municipal governance reforms was to ensure that the common man did not have to run from pillar or post,” Gomes said. One person who has seen this first hand is outgoing CCP councillor Pundalik Raut Dessai. Dessai said that the CCP bylaws that were meant to give the corporation some teeth remain languishing with the state government. “In 2002, the Act came in and till now we don’t have all the bylaws. Unless you have the bylaws, no change can come to CCP,” Dessai said. CCP had submitted nine different bylaws to the directorate of municipal administration, of which just two have been notified. Out of the 18 functions that the 74th Amendment of the Constitution states should be devolved to the urban local bodies, only five functions are independently controlled by CCP, while 10 functions are handled by multiple agencies and three are completely under state control. “In my opinion, whether it is CCP or Vasco or Margao, all the administrative control must be given to the local bodies. Attach the service divisions to the urban local bodies so that they are answerable to the citizens. This is a wasteful exercise to get 30 people elected, because they have no powers,” Gomes said. As Dessai put it, CCP should cater to the needs of Panjimites from birth to death. “When you are born, you are registered with CCP and when you die, your death is registered with CCP. In between you require health, so better health care has to be given by CCP. You need education, which CCP has to improve. You need power, water, sewerage, which CCP does not give but other corporations do,” Dessai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/despite-corporation-tag-ccp-lacks-powers-service-delivery/articleshow/81578448.cms||Newton Sequeira

It made the air cleaner by cutting down on the pollutions levels significantly. A study conducted by Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Institute (CSMCRI) and Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR) Ghaziabad on the pollution levels in the world’s biggest ship dismantling facility shows that it is within threshold limits and suggests that overall Air Quality Index (AQI) improved significantly during lockdown. The study found four-fold reduction of PM2.5 and SPM values during lockdown.They took samples of ambient air, coastal water, coastal sediments, fish and bioaccumulation of heavy metals in and around Alang for five days during complete lockdown (May 12-16) for the study, which it conducted in collaboration with According to GMB data in the last 15 years a total of 3906 ships with 33.896 MMT of light displacement tonnage (LDT) were recycled at Alang. While comparing it with 2018 and 2019 data researchers found the results promising as PM10 values during lockdown were reduced by 3.75 to 4.5 times as compared with the previous two years. It also found gaseous pollutants like NO2 and O3 within safe limits.The report stated drastic reduction in the majority of the nutrient parameters in the coastal water. “This proves that the coastal environment has its efficient self-cleaning potential if there is considerable reduction in anthropogenic as well as industrial activity,” said the report.The study was done by Amit Chanchpara, Vasavdutta Sonpal, Gauravkumar Mehta, Tarini Prashad Sahoo, Ravikumar Thorat, Sanak Ray and Soumya Haldar who utilized the opportunity to collect baseline data in Alang ship recycling yard to find the environment level when there was no existence of this industry. This data can be treated as baseline data for new normal conditions and help to generate environmental standards for ship breaking yards across the world. When the ship arrives at Alang for dismantling they contain complex materials including hazardous substances which needs to be disposed of in environmentally safe manar following international parameters. Avantika Singh vice chairman and CEO of GMB said “A significant reduction in pollution levels was recorded. This data confirmed that the downstream waste management facility developed by GMB considerably reduced the impact of ship recycling activities at Alang.” Atul Sharma senior environment engineer, GMB said, “CSMCRI did the complete scanning of the environment here and found that 40 years of pollution was abolished in three months of lockdown. That means that the temporary pollutants are within the threshold value of the natural ecosystem so when we zero down all the activity the pollution level came down.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/three-months-lockdown-cleanses-alangs-lungs/articleshow/81576301.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

He also asked the officials to take the cases of violation of noise pollution rules seriously and act accordingly. “I have asked DMs and SSPs of all four districts that there should be a ban on public address system/loudspeakers between 10 pm and 6 am as per noise pollution rules,” he told TOI on Thursday. He added, “If any individual wants to enjoy music during marriage ceremonies, parties, etc., he or she should take permission from authorities concerned. Permission to play music in certain volume/ decibel would be given in only closed rooms/buildings.” He said that I have asked officials concerned to ensure that there should not be any violation of rules. The officials of police, administration and pollution board should also ensure that no one is allowed to disturb the peace of others between 10 pm and 6 am. The issue came up after Allahabad University VC Prof Sangita Srivastava recently complained to Prayagraj district magistrate Bhanu Chandra Goswami about high-decibel ‘azaan on mic’ at a mosque in Civil Lines near her residence disturbing her sleep and affecting her health. The VC also referred to the judgement passed by the Allahabad High Court in PIL No. 570 of 2020 (Afzal Ansari and 2 others Versus state of UP and 2 others) and demanded action.

There is no dearth of employment opportunities in the state now and 4 lakh youths got government jobs in a fair, transparent manner during these four years.” “We tackled the corona crisis and created 1.25 crore employment opportunities. We gave employment to 1.1 crore labourers under MGNREGA while 58,758 Banking Sakhi correspondents were appointed. Today’s Uttar Pradesh is ready to challenge cities like Bengaluru in IT as 75 lakh job opportunities will be generated with a data centre coming up at Noida. ODOP, startups and defence corridor will also create jobs,” he said. Mass copying in exams during previous governments dented the image of the state, but after coming to power we took action against copying mafia with the use of technology. Even during the Corona crisis, 3 crore copies were checked and results were declared in June, said Sharma. Kushinagar airport will increase tourism in Purvanchal while the Jewar Airport will open gates for development and prosperity, he added. The deputy CM also attended the fourth convocation of Siddharth University in Siddharthnagar district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/four-years-of-yogi-govt-golden-period-of-up-dy-cm/articleshow/81576095.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Aurangabad||Designer flees with over 770 gm gold||Aurangabad: A gold jewellery maker has been booked by the Aurangabad city police on the charges of cheating and criminal breach of trust after he fled with about 770gm of gold that had been given to him by four jewellers. The jewellers wanted ornaments made with the gold. The police said that the total market valuation of the stolen gold is more than Rs 33 lakh. Inspector Sambhaji Pawar said, “The suspect hails from West Bengal and had a good reputation amongst the city-based jewellers. So far, four jewellers have come forward with the complaint against this particular designer, but none of them have any proof to show that they had given him the gold.” Aurangabad and different parts of the state are heavily dependent on highly-skilled, traditional jewellery makers from West Bengal. The business is based on mutual trust between the jeweller and the skilled workers giving shape to and designing the precious metal. Based on the complaint lodged by Ajay Mevlani, a jeweller, the police have registered a case against the suspect. Mevlani stated that four jewellers (including himself) had given the suspect 357.5gm, 127.31gm, 54.66gm and 230gm of gold, respectively, on March 5. Days later, the suspect suddenly went missing. Even his mobile phone was switched off and his rented accommodation was found to be locked. A police team has already reached out to the suspect’s acquaintances, contacts and fellow technicians to gather clues. Pawar said, “His fellow technicians are worried about their own credibility and fear that they will lose trust. They have all voluntarily come forward to assist the police.” An officer privy to the probe said that the suspect had been working in Aurangabad for the past seven years and over these years, there had not been a single complaint or any issue in transactions with him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/designer-flees-with-over-770-gm-gold/articleshow/81574659.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Around 100 women associated with 10 self help groups have prepared herbal gulal and colours using flowers offered in temples and farm houses. Women groups in Chaka, Baharia and Bahadurpur blocks have collected flowers from several temples in the city, and in trans Ganga and trans Yamuna pockets. After receiving orders from traders’ organisations in Prayagraj and adjoining districts, they have begun preparing herbal colours. “Herbal gulal and colours are not at all harmful for the skin and do not have any side effects on public health,” said district mission manager (DMM) of National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM), Amit Shukla. He added, “Owing to the escalating demand for herbal gulal, abir and other colours, women groups have joined hands to prepare the same in three blocks of the district including Chaka, Bahadurpur and Baharia. SHGs in trans Ganga and trans Yamuna pockets will also follow suit soon.” Herbal gulal and colours made from flowers, fruits and ingredients such as turmeric, marigold, rose, beetroot, spinach and pomegranate are beneficial for health. Women groups have collected flowers used in marriage ceremonies, and from fields of farmers involved in flower cultivation in trans Yamuna belt. They have prepared herbal gulal in nine different colours. Several women had returned to their native villages in trans Ganga and trans Yamuna areas during the intitial days of the pandemic, and had made efforts to set up small businesses for their livelihood. This is the first time when women associated with SHGs have collected funds under the Community Investment Fund (CIF) to run their businesses in the blocks. Sudha, a volunteer of the group, said, “Initially, we thought to prepare items which could be easily sold in the market. But eventually, we realised that demand for herbal gulal and colours has increased manifold in the market, and statrted started preparing the same.” The SHGs have also planned to prepare food items for Holi such as gujia, and stalls will be set up in the city, and trans Ganga and trans Yamuna pockets for sale. Sushma, another volunteer, said, “We are happy to have found work in our own villages. With more and more orders, we will get more work, and will earn more.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/women-groups-prepare-herbal-gulal-and-colours-for-a-safe-holi/articleshow/81576279.cms||---

The victory in Jalgaon has helped elevate Shinde’s image before the state leadership.  “The way Shinde in Thane handled the situation even as the state leadership was busy with the Mansukh Hiran murder case is likely to be noticed and will bring him closer to his boss,” a political observer said. Senior politicians from Thane said that after the unease among BJP corporators in Jalgaon was spotted, the state leadership along with Gulabrao Patil, a party colleague from Jalgaon, sought Shinde’s assistance. Shinde then activated his team here, who ensured the BJP corporators were kept away from the public eye, especially the BJP units looking for them. While most BJP corporators had their phones switched off, a few were connecting with loyalists on social media but without disclosing locations. “The group of corporators was brought in secretly together and housed in a Ghodbunder hotel for the last five days. We were keeping a hawk-eye vigil to ensure no outsider was allowed to meet these netas till the polls on Thursday morning. The exercise was executed by a handful of trusted lieutenants from Thane and Mumbai,” said mayor Naresh Mhaske. Corporator Siddharth Owalekar, who stayed at the hotel with the Jalgaon netas, said they were impressed with Thane’s development and had assured the Shiv Sena leadership of helping the party gain a majority in the next polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-senas-jalgaon-victory-scripted-by-eknath-shinde-and-team-in-thane/articleshow/81578584.cms||Manoj Badgeri

Based on monthly mobility rate of the people within the state after lockdown, V-shaped recovery was attributed to the state, said the report. It said monthly unemployment rate in the state had fallen from 14.7% in May 2020 to 7% in December 2020. V-shaped recovery means that the economy bounced back quickly to its baseline before the crisis, with no hiccups along the way. Growth continues at the same rate as before. This is one of the most optimistic recovery patterns because it implies that the downturn did not cause any lasting damage to the economy. The other two symbols of economic recovery, according to experts, are U-shaped recovery and L-shaped recovery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-records-v-shaped-recovery/articleshow/81577446.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Following the resurgence of Covid cases in urban and rural areas of district, the administration has urged health officials and police to step up enforcement of Covid norms. The drive in Bela is aimed at ensuring enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour with a humane approach. The rural population of Bela, which is around 50km from city having population of around 14,000, is appreciating the initiative. Beginning Wednesday, Waghode collected more than Rs6,000 fine in 33 cases and distributed around 300 masks for free. The API had procured the masks through his own network. Waghode said before starting the drive he first held a meeting with the villagers and volunteers to spread awareness. “We observed that a section of population, especially the economically backward class, was using clothes, torn napkins, handkerchiefs and such things to cover faces,” he said. “One section of the population did not have access to masks due to economic reasons. On the other hand, there was a section which could afford to buy masks but was not doing so due to ignorance,” he said. “We were slapping fines on people who were not using masks despite being aware and having capacity to purchase them. Masks are being given for free to those who really appeared to be needy one,” said the API. Waghode, who suggested replicating the ‘Bela pattern’ elsewhere in the rural parts, said his drive would continue in the coming days as a part of his experiment to fight the pandemic with humane approach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bela-api-giving-masks-for-free-to-needy-going-tough-on-violators/articleshow/81576329.cms||Soumitra Bose

The loco pilot, assistant pilot and guard were suspended on Thursday. The train was close to its destination, Tanakpur, on Wednesday around 4pm when an animal strayed onto the tracks. "The snag developed after the train hit cattle,” Izzatnagar railway division PRO Rajendra Singh told TOI. The loco pilot appears to have hit the brakes hard, because of which the air pressure vacuum pipe burst. “The driver may have lost control of the engine and the train started moving backwards,” a railways official said. In the train compartments, there was panic. “Initially, we thought the train was going back to change tracks. But it gathered speed, and we realised something was wrong,” said Dev Singh, a TTE on board the train at the time. In video clips that went viral, the train can be seen running in the opposite direction as curious onlookers scream that there are passengers inside. “We were surrounded by passengers who wanted answers, but even we didn’t know what was happening … Those were the most frantic moments of my life,” said Lakshman Singh, the other TTE on board. Tanakpur, at an elevation of 259m, is higher than the other stations. “The loco pilot could not stop the train as it started rolling backwards. He informed the control room immediately and all nearby stations were alerted. Our team went to several crossings, and placed sand and boulders on the tracks,” the railways official said. All crossings along the route, meanwhile, were shut. “The field staff was advised to alert locals to stay away from the tracks,” Rajendra Singh said. Some passengers tried pulling the chain, but the train did not stop. "Then, we got calls from our seniors telling us the brakes had failed,” said Lakshman Singh. “We did not want the people to get hurt. So, we gathered them in the compartments at the front (closer to the engine, away from any possible impact if the train hit something on the tracks),” Dev Singh added. The train finally stopped near Chakarpur, two stations away from Tanakpur. “Passengers were unhurt. They were sent back to Tanakpur on two buses,” KD Kapri, station superintendent of Khatima, near which the train stopped, said. Izzatnagar divisional railway manager Ashutosh Pant said a three-member team has been set up to conduct an inquiry Watch Uttarakhand: Train rolls backwards for 35km in Tanakpur||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/43-on-board-train-runs-backwards-for-20km-after-brakes-fail/articleshow/81574705.cms||Prashant Jha

The state government has allotted a total of Rs 2,381 crore in its annual financial budget for the 2021-22 for various components of water utilities. On Thursday, the government announced allotment of Rs 725 crore to build an independent head works at Nagarjunasagar. It aims to draw raw water directly from the foreshore of Nagarjunasagar from deeper water levels. The estimated cost of this project is Rs 1,450 crore. Sunkishala independent intake head works was proposed in 2012 to ensure stabilised supply from Krishna for all the three phases, but it could not materialise. “Now, the water board need not install pumping station at Puttamgandi to draw and pump raw Krishna water and spend Rs 5 crore to Rs 9 crore every year, which is heavy financial burden for us,” said a senior HMWS&SB official. Additionally, Rs 250 crore was proposed for the supply of free drinking water to avoid financial burden on water board for 20 kl free water scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rs-2-3k-crore-allotted-for-water-utilities/articleshow/81577450.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Nagpur||Siblings of Walker-I and II a mating pair in Painganga||Nagpur: After a gap of nearly 25 years, the Painganga wildlife sanctuary in Yavatmal district has got a pair of breeding tigers, with male T1-C2 being joined by female T3-C2 from Pandharkawda territorial forest. The last official record of two resident tigers in Painganga was in 1997. The female is said to be the sibling of T3-C1 aka Walker-II, which had reached Gautala Autramghat wildlife sanctuary, 70km from Aurangabad, traversing 2,100km. APCCF & Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) field director MS Reddy said the female was sighted some 10-15 days ago in the park by staff and also by tourists from Adilabad. Both the siblings, T1-C1 aka Walker-I & T1-C2 had dispersed together in June 2019, from Tipeshwar sanctuary (148sqkm). “While Walker went towards Telangana and again returned to Painganga and further moved to Dnyanganga, T1-C2 stayed put in Painganga and was very much in the sanctuary for a year-and-a-half. Now, he has been joined by a young female,” said Reddy. According to Kharbi RFO Nitin Atpadkar, “Though T1-C2 was in Painganga, it was shy and rarely seen during patrolling. However, after the arrival of female T3-C2, the male has suddenly become active. Both were also seen mating several times. If all goes well, Painganga will turn a new leaf with the arrival of cubs in July.” “We have been regularly patrolling and the area where tigers have been sighted is completely inviolate and free of habitation and grazing. In Kharbi range, there are six villages that need to be relocated but these habitations are over 10km away from the tiger-bearing area,” said Atpadkar. Pandharkawda DFO (wildlife) Subhash Puranik said, “The dispersal of female T3-C2 crossing all hurdles and using small forest patches and perennial nullas show how important they are. Usually, farmers tend to clear them, causing conflict.” “Though the distance between Tipeshwar and Painganga is 75km, T3-C2 must have traveled around 150km as migration study shows that tigers move towards Adilabad, Pimalgaon, Ambadi, and Kinwat to enter Painganga. The dispersal shows that it is a viable corridor and needs to be strengthened,” adds Puranik. According to forest officials posted in Pandharkawda earlier, there was sporadic migration of tigers from Tipeshwar to Painganga. “Even if there were dispersals, they were not known due to the absence of advanced technology like camera traps and radio collars,” they said. As reported by TOI, a report by NGO Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT) said a tiger from Pandharkawda had travelled 150km to reach Kawal Tiger Reserve in Telangana in January 2016. Later, on March 19, 2017, the forest department found that a tigress from Tipeshwar had dispersed to Painganga. Whereabouts of this tigress were not known as she moved further, deserting Painganga. In 2019, WII radio-collared T1-C1 that logged 3,020km to reach Dnyanganga. “Due to the relocation of villages, Tipeshwar has become a source population of tigers, but its area is too small to hold a sizeable number of tigers. In Painganga, there are ungulates for tigers to survive. Tigers can boost the local economy by way of ecotourism. It is also high time Tipeshwar and Painganga (550sqkm) are combined to be notified as a tiger reserve for better management,” said wildlife photographer Sarosh Lodhi.

Attending the ceremony in Lucknow, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said there was no bigger charitable act than performing “kanyadaan”. Saying that no construction or infrastructure development was possible without labourers, it was the duty of a welfare government to take care of them and his government had launched several schemes for them. “I feel that of all state government schemes, community marriage scheme has been one of the most appreciated ones. I had said that all will be benefited under the scheme, irrespective of their caste or class. We have held several mass wedding programmes for daughters of labourers and just last month, 2,700 girls got married in Moradabad,” he said. The CM added that Rs 51,000 is given to each couple under the scheme and when it was launched, the Opposition had attacked it, saying that this was an insult to poor families and to girls. “However, over the past four years, marriages of 1.75 lakh poor girls have taken place under this scheme,” he said. Referring to the Covid-19 lockdown in March 2020, Yogi said the government had launched the first scheme for labourers. An allowance for food and other necessities was given to 54 lakh labourers, including registered construction workers, street vendors, coolies at railway and bus stations, palledar in mandis. In addition to this, he said, free ration was given to families who returned to the state during the lockdown under the PM Garib Kalyan package. Gas cylinders for six months, an additional allowance for three months, advance pensions for widows, destitute women and differently abled were also distributed to needy families. “There are a lot of schemes about which people do not know even now, and therefore, are notable to benefit from them. I am directing all concerned departments to publicise these schemes property. One such scheme is the Atal Residential School programme, under which the state government is building 18 residential schools for children of construction workers and orphans,” he said, adding that lives of construction labourers were uncertain as they had to move around for work and this affected the lives of their children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/3500-daughters-of-labourers-tie-the-knot-at-mass-marriage-event/articleshow/81578589.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Hyderabad||Oppn parties fail to make an impression in WKN seat||Hyderabad: The BJP, Congress, TDP and left parties have failed to impress the graduates as candidates from these parties were trailing in fourth, fifth and sixth positions in the Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda (WKN) graduates MLC constituency. The BJP, which was expected to put up a good show in the MLC election after its victory in Dubbak bypoll followed by its stunning performance in the GHMC election, could not find favour with the educated lot in WKN seat. After five rounds of counting of first preference votes in thes constituency, BJP’s G Premender Reddy polled only 28,991 votes and was placed in fourth position. Palla Rajeshwar Reddy of the TRS was leading with 79,113 votes, followed by Teenmar Mallanna with 60,564 votes and TJS candidate M Kodandaram who polled 49,200 votes. However, the BJP is giving a neck and neck fight to the TRS in Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar constituency where its sitting MLC N Ramchander Rao is trailing S Vani Devi by only 5,000-odd votes. The poor show of Congress continued even in the MLC elections. Both its candidates — former MLC S Ramulu Naik who is in the fray from WKN seat and former minister G Chinna Reddy in HRM seat — are training in fifth and fourth places respectively. AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan, however, exuded confidence of putting up a good show by the time counting of votes is completed and result is announced. AICC secretary SA Sampath Kumar and Sravan said no one expected the graduates and unemployed to vote for the TRS but the ruling party is leading in both the MLC seats. “Despite leading in both the constituencies, its vote share is less than 30 per cent which means 70 per cent of the vote share is anti-TRS government and has been divided among the opposition parties and independents,” said Sravan. The CPI-CPM combine fielded Jayasaradhi Reddy, who is trailing in the sixth place in WKN seat, while TDP state president L Ramana had polled just 2,700-odd votes after three rounds of counting by 9 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/oppn-parties-fail-to-make-an-impression-in-wkn-seat/articleshow/81577455.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Hyderabad||Mallanna emerges tough challenger to TRS, oppn||Hyderabad: Independent candidate Teenmar Mallanna has emerged as a serious challenger to the TRS, BJP, Congress and TJS president M Kodandaram in Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam graduate MLC constituency election. This journalist-turned-politician who became popular for his sharp criticism of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and his family, had taken up 1,650-km padayatra in the constituency in the run-up to the MLC polls. After the first four rounds of counting of first preference votes, he was in second place with 48,004 votes trailing only behind TRS sitting MLC Palla Rajeshwar Reddy who had polled 63,442 votes. Professor Kodandaram, who is tipped to emerge as a dark horse going by the trends on the polling day on Sunday, was in third place behind Mallanna and Palla Rajeshwar, followed by BJP’s Premender Reddy in fourth place and Congress’ Sabavath Ramulu Naik in the fifth spot in the constituency. This is not the first time that Mallanna is contesting. He had earlier too contested from the MLC constituency and finished third with BJP in second place and TRS candidate being the winner in 2015 elections. He had also contested the bypoll to Huzurnagar and lost deposit. However, Mallanna is confident of pulling off a win this time. “In Dubbak, BJP’s Raghunandan Rao sent back finance minister T Harish Rao home. In GHMC polls, BJP’s Bandi Sanjay sent KT Rama Rao home. In this election, I am going to send KCR to his farmhouse permanently,” he said. Despite some popular candidates like M Kodandaram, Cheruku Sudhakar and Ramulu Naik, who were in the forefront of Telangana agitation, being in the electoral fray from Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam constituency, Mallanna is confident of defeating them at least with second preference votes. Mallanna himself had participated in Telangana agitation. “Many graduates thought I was a safe bet for second preference vote as I don’t belong to any political party. People are searching for a candidate who is fighting for them at the ground level,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mallanna-emerges-tough-challenger-to-trs-oppn/articleshow/81577507.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Hyderabad||Most independents confined to single-digit votes||Hyderabad: Some candidates in the graduates MLC elections have got zero votes or votes in single digits. As counting progressed for Khammam-Warangal-Nalgonda and Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar graduates’ constituencies on Thursday, several independent candidates got hardly any votes. In the Khammam-Warangal-Nalgonda graduates’ constituency, out of 71 candidates, as many as 39 candidates got votes in single digits at the time of counting on Thursday evening. This was at the juncture when a total of 55,994 votes had been counted in which 52,771 were valid and 3,223 were invalid. At this point, two candidates had not even opened their score as the sheet showed zero votes against their names. Some were better. Four candidates got one vote each. Other candidates among the 39 who got single digit votes got anywhere between zero and eight. Some scraped through to get into single digits. Three candidates got 10 votes. A large number of contestants jumped into the fray in the MLC elections. While some independents got a respectable number of votes and even gave the candidates of political parties a run for their money, most of them could boast of nothing but single or double digit votes. In the Hyderabads-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar graduates’ constituency, the situation for many independents was slightly better. While candidates of the major political parties and a handful of independents polled a good chunk of votes or a respectable number, several others were stuck in single or double digits. Of the 93 candidates in fray until 1,68,032 votes were counted, 1,57,950 were valid and 10,082 were invalid. None of the candidates got zero but five were in single digits, with one candidate having polled two votes. As many as 69 candidates got votes in double digits – a performance much better than what is noticed is Khammam-Warangal-Nalgonda constituency. The exception among independents is K Nageshwar who polled 25,505 votes out of the 1,68,032 votes counted so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/most-independents-confined-to-single-digit-votes/articleshow/81577485.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Hyderabad||Second preference votes will decide winner: Kodandaram||Hyderabad: Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) president M Kodandaram said that the result of the Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam seat is unlikely to be decided by first preference votes. He said the second preference vote will decide the winner and he is expecting a turn-around in his favour when the counting for second preference votes begins. Kodandaram has made his electoral debut from Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam graduates MLC constituency. Dumped by TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao after the formation of the state, this election is crucial for Kodandaram. The political scenario in the state will change drastically if Kodandaram wins. Several prominent leaders who are not interested to stay back in TRS, Congress, BJP or those who are yet to join any party, are expected to join Kodandaram’s party, if he wins.  Kodandaram said that given the trend, it is clear now that there is a lot of resentment against the TRS. “There is a huge anti-government vote which has unfortunately got divided among opposition parties and independent candidates. This is a great loss to the opposition , independents as well as the majority who had voted against the government,” he said. The feedback is that a large number of electors who gave first preference votes to either TRS, BJP, Congress or Teenmar Mallanna, gave second preference votes to Kodandaram, a TJS leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/second-preference-votes-will-decide-winner-kodandaram/articleshow/81577534.cms||Roushan Ali

The Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR) said the TDP has assets worth Rs 193 crore which puts the party in the fourth position, while the TRS stands at sixth with Rs 188 crore assets. The YSRC with Rs 93 crore occupies the eighth rank in the financial year 2018-19. The Samajwadi Party tops the list with Rs 572 crore assets, followed by Naveen Patnaik’s BJD with Rs 232 crore assets. Tamil Nadu’s ruling AIADMK party is in third position with Rs 206 crore assets. The total assets of TDP include fixed deposits of Rs 115 crore. The TRS has Rs 152 crore FDs. The YSRC tops other parties among other assets category with Rs 79 crore assets. In 2018-19, the TDP declared Rs 18 crore as its liabilities, the highest declared by any party, followed by JD(S) which had Rs 18 crore liabilities. Forum for Good Governance Padmanabha Reddy said political parties and the Election Commission of India should ensure better transparency in recording donations. “The electoral bonds’ details should also be revealed. Huge money is being spent by the parties. The real value of assets could be much more than what is cited. Auditing and accounting should also be improved,” he said. Reddy said electoral malpractices and spending money should be checked so that political parties need not resort to corrupt practices. ADR’s analysis showed that assets and liabilities declared by 39 regional parties in 2016-17 were to the tune of Rs 1,267 crore, while the worth of 41 regional parties in 2017-18 was Rs 1,320 crore. The total liabilities declared by the regional parties in 2018-19 were to the tune of Rs 79 crore — Rs 47 crore under borrowings and Rs 32 crore under other liabilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tdp-trs-ysrc-among-top-10-rich-regional-parties/articleshow/81577531.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Hyderabad||6% votes invalid as grads err on jumbo ballot paper||Hyderabad: To their shock, the election authorities found a large number of invalid votes during the counting process of two graduates MLC constituencies on Thursday. Though the voters are graduates, a majority of them erred while voting on the jumbo ballot paper and also while giving their preferential vote to the candidates. For instance, by the end of the fourth round of counting for Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar constituency, 13,364 votes were invalid out of the total 2.24 lakh counted till then. This amounts to 6 per cent of votes going waste, an official explained. In Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda constituency, out of total 2.8 lakh votes counted after five rounds, around 15,533 votes turned out to be invalid. The officials attributed the invalid votes polled to circling the number, putting a tick mark instead of writing the preferential number and marking the same preferential number to multiple candidates. BJP candidate G Premender Reddy, who is in the race from WKN seat, said several graduates have enrolled online this time. “They have not voted in a graduates MLC elections before. Apart from the fresh graduate voters, elderly voters due to ageing issues may have found it difficult to mark preferential voting in the jumbo ballot,” he observed. He said the preferential voting system was introduced when there were only a few thousand voters. “Now, there are more than five lakh voters in each graduates MLC constituency. The election authorities, Centre and state governments should change this system. There should be a direct election for graduates MLC seats,” he said. He also expressed concern over wasting of resources and time. “Counting is taking almost three days. It’s high time an amendment was brought,” he felt. Independent candidate professor K Nageshwar said the invalid votes show lack of awareness among voters. “Even several bogus voters have been enrolled. Booth-level officers did not do proper verification during enrolment,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/6-votes-invalid-as-grads-err-on-jumbo-ballot-paper/articleshow/81577513.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The loco pilot, assistant pilot and guard were suspended on Thursday. The train was close to its destination, Tanakpur, on Wednesday around 4pm when an animal strayed onto the tracks. “The engine brakes failed after the train hit cattle,” Izzatnagar railway division PRO Rajendra Singh told TOI. The loco pilot appears to have hit the brakes hard, because of which the air pressure vacuum pipe burst. “The driver may have lost control of the engine and the train started moving backwards,” a railways official said. In the train compartments, there was panic. “Initially, we thought the train was going back to change tracks. But it gathered speed, and we realised something was wrong,” said Dev Singh, a TTE on board the train at the time. In video clips that went viral, the train can be seen running in the opposite direction as curious onlookers scream that there are passengers inside. “We were surrounded by passengers who wanted answers, but even we didn’t know what was happening … Those were the most frantic moments of my life,” said Lakshman Singh, the other TTE on board. Tanakpur, at an elevation of 259m, is higher than the other stations. “The loco pilot could not stop the train as it started rolling backwards. He informed the control room immediately and all nearby stations were alerted. Our team went to several crossings, and placed sand and boulders on the tracks,” the railways official said. All crossings along the route, meanwhile, were shut. “The field staff was advised to alert locals to stay away from the tracks,” Rajendra Singh said. Some passengers tried pulling the chain, but the train did not stop. "Then, we got calls from our seniors telling us the brakes had failed,” said Lakshman Singh. “We did not want the people to get hurt. So, we gathered them in the compartments at the front (closer to the engine, away from any possible impact if the train hit something on the tracks),” Dev Singh added. The train finally stopped near Chakarpur, two stations away from Tanakpur. “Passengers were unhurt. They were sent back to Tanakpur on two buses,” KD Kapri, station superintendent of Khatima, near which the train stopped, said. Izzatnagar divisional railway manager Ashutosh Pant said a three-member team has been set up to conduct an inquiry||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/43-on-board-train-runs-backwards-for-20km-after-brakes-fail/articleshow/81574713.cms||Prashant Jha

This is the highest single-day tally recorded this year. On December 27, Delhi had reported 757 new cases. Friday’s cases came out of 77,352 tests — 47,078 RT-PCR and 30,274 rapid antigen tests. The positivity rate was slightly up at 0.93%, officials said. Health officials said the total Covid tally had touched 6,46,348. With four more deaths in the past 24 hours, the fatality count has reached 10,953 — the fourth highest in the country. Maharashtra has recorded maximum deaths due to Covid-19 in the country with 53,208 fatalities, followed by Tamil Nadu at 12,582 and Karnataka at 12,425. Covid-19 cases have been rising daily in the capital over the past four days. Since Monday, 368, 425, 536 and 607 cases were recorded respectively. The number of active cases now stands at 3,165 as against 2,924 a day ago. “The trend is worrying. It is signalling another peak in cases. We have to strengthen testing and tracing mechanisms in addition to increasing the infrastructure for isolation and treatment of persons suffering from moderate to severe symptoms,” said a senior doctor at Safdarjung Hospital. While the first case was recorded in Delhi on March 2 last year, the outbreak peaked about four months later, with the city recording over 2,000 cases daily in June. The peak continued for nearly five months, before the situation improving since December. In February, Delhi recorded only about 140 cases daily. However, since March 1, the city has recorded 7,059 new cases, averaging a daily tally of around 372 cases. The demand for Covid beds has also gone up significantly over the past few weeks. On Thursday, the Delhi Corona app showed 839 out of the 5,711 beds as occupied. The occupancy of ICU beds with ventilator and without ventilator support stood at 155 and 188, respectively. “There are around 1,624 patients under home isolation,” an official said. “Like Maharashtra, Delhi is also witnessing a resurgence in new cases. We need to act fast in putting in place containment and contact tracing measures to prevent another potential crisis. Also, testing must remain high,” said an expert. Those at high risk of developing severe symptoms due to the infection should be vaccinated at the earliest, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/daily-covid-tally-crosses-700-for-first-time-this-yr/articleshow/81595344.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

While Vani Devi, daughter of former prime minister Late PV Narasimha Rao, was leading with 53,007 votes in Hyderabad-RR-Mahbubnagar constituency against BJP’s sitting MLC N Ramchander Rao who polled 48,563 after three rounds of counting of first preference votes. However, Rani Rudrama Reddy, who was in the forefront of the Telangana statehood agitation, managed to get in all 5,764 first preference votes after five rounds of counting in Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam MLC constituency. She had gone to the hustings with all guns blazing against the TRS government appealing to the graduates to teach a lesson to the KCR-led government for suppressing the aspirations of the people of the state through unfulfilled promises made during the Telangana movement and the various elections in the state. During campaign, she had said that she would become the voice of the neglected graduates and question the government on promises made to them in and outside the legislative council, if she was elected as MLC. Yuva Telangana Party was floated to fight against the government on people’s issues and pending promises made by the chief minister during the Telangana agitation and after the formation of the state, she said.

---||Delhi||Open up walk-in jabs for all: Delhi CM to centre||NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged the central government on Thursday to relax the guidelines to allow walk-in vaccinations for everyone. He also said that Delhi government was going to vaccinate 1.25 lakh people per day instead of the 30,000-40,000 in a day currently by doubling the inoculation centres and keeping the centres at Delhi government hospitals open till 9pm. “On one hand, India has taken a lead in making a vaccine for the coronavirus. On the other hand, we are unfortunately observing a rise in Covid-19 cases across the country. I appeal to the central government to bring some relaxation in the corona vaccination guidelines in terms of age groups that are eligible for the vaccine,” Kejriwal said in a digital press briefing, describing the current regime guidelines as very rigid. TimesViewMaximising every state’s vaccination potential is imperative. With cases rising at an alarming pace, this is an innovative suggestion which should be considered.Kejriwal said that production of vaccine in India was adequate to meet all demands. So, he argued, instead of complicated lists that make eligibility on the grounds of age or the presence of co-morbidities, etc., there should instead be just a list of who were ineligible to receive the vaccine, such as those below the age of 18 year and people might have some specific medical condition. The CM advised those who were eligible to get vaccinated because there was no cause to be scared or hesitant about the jab. Kejriwal said that everyone should be allowed to take the injection now and that there should be walk-in vaccination centres. “If the central government allows vaccination for all, and if we get a sufficient supply of the vaccine, we have a plan already formulated to administer the vaccine to the entire capital over the next three months,” he claimed. The CM appealed to the centre to decentralise the system, exert less control over it and allow the state governments to administer the vaccine on a war footing. As for Delhi, Kejriwal said that apart from doubling the vaccination centres from 500 to 1,000, the inoculation timing of 9am to 5pm has been increased from 9am to 9pm. “In the last few days, we have seen a spike in the number of Covid cases,” he noted, adding that the surge was not steep like in June, September and November, 2020. In the last three days, however, the growth has been more than over the last few weeks with more than 500 cases recorded in a single day. “Delhi government is deeply concerned about the situation,” Kejriwal said, assuring that the increase not dangerous and the situation was being closely monitored. He added, “We observed a certain amount of laxity in the entire system because the cases had gone down. We will be implementing the tracking, tracing and isolating system with full dedication again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/open-up-walk-in-jabs-for-all-cm-to-centre/articleshow/81576499.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Nagpur||ISRO’s S-TIC at VNIT to provide future space entrepreneurs & leaders: Padole||Nagpur: To boost space exploration activities in Vidarbha, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has chosen Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) for setting up its ‘Space Technology Incubation Centre (S-TIC).’ This is the first centre from western region to cater to the needs of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Goa and UTs of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu besides Maharashtra. A memorandum of understanding was inked online between ISRO’s capacity building programme office (CBPO) director PV Venkitakrishnan and VNIT director Pramod Padole on Thursday. ISRO chairman K Sivan presided over the programme. The Bangalore-based premier organization plans to open six such S-TICs across the country. On Friday, it opened a new one at NIT Rourkela. Speaking to TOI, Padole termed the collaboration as a proud moment for VNIT that would open up new opportunities for research and development as well as space start-ups.Excerpts...What is the objective of S-TIC?To attract and nurture young academia with innovative ideas/research aptitude for carrying out research activities. The centre would motivate and support them to initiate startups and business in the field of space technology and applications. It also aims at establishing academia- industry eco-system in the entire western region. S-TIC will provide space entrepreneurs and leaders for the future.In what way will the S-TIC operate?VNIT will receive Rs 2 crore as annual seed money for two years. A major part of it will be utilized for carrying out research activities and product development along with facility augmentation for the projects. ISRO would initiate relevant projects which can be later taken up by VNIT. The hi-tech facilities at ISRO would be made available to our teachers and students as well.Will S-TIC be available for other students as well?Any engineering student from the entire western region can approach our S-TIC monitoring committee which would comprise of senior and junior professors and those from the industry. During the signing of the MoU, ISRO chief K Sivan presented ‘YUKTI-Sanchita 2021’ which contains a list of 108 problems. We will offer this list to the students and invite suggestions for solving these problems. If the committee finds their concepts good then incubation grants would be given to them. They can make prototypes by using software and hardware at VNIT and in this regard Siemen Siemens Centre of Excellence can play an important role.What would VNIT offer S-TIC?We’re offering around 5,000 sq ft area on the sixth floor of our academic block for setting up S-TIC along with other facilities and laboratories. Our electrical engineering department’s associate professor Sunil Bhat has been appointed as the coordinator. We’ll also involve our faculty members, students, alumni and local industries.Why was VNIT chosen from the entire western region?We’ve been making efforts to strengthen industry-institute interaction and create an ecosystem for pre-incubation, incubation, and startups along with research and development activities since many years. In the last three years, VNIT received 18 patents and ranked fourth in India by an ‘India Today’ survey. Currently, we’re working on over 100 projects amounting to Rs 55 crore. We’ve also improved our NIRF ranking from 31st last year to 27th.Box S-TIC research & products to be used in future space missions: SivanHailing the tie up with VNIT, ISRO chairman K Sivan said space technology related research and products at S-TICs would be used in future space missions. The Bangalore-based agency would also provide projects of practical relevance where students can work. “The trio of ISRO, academia and industry through S-TIC can help solve problems in space technology. Testing and validation of students’ products will be carried out at S-TIC and if required from ISRO labs. Startups at S-TIC can eventually approach the ‘Indian National Space Promotion Authorization and Centre (INSPACE)’,” he said, adding that it would help in nation building through Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan in space technology and applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/isros-s-tic-at-vnit-to-provide-future-space-entrepreneurs-leaders-padole/articleshow/81608506.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Hyderabad||HC picks holes in revenuetribunals’ 16k judgments||Hyderabad: Wondering whether the newly-constituted revenue tribunals are burying justice with their hurried verdicts, the Telangana high court on Thursday put a question mark over 16,000 such judgments delivered by these tribunals in the last few weeks. Following a PIL filed by N Srinivas Rao from Bhadradri Kothagudem district charging the state government and the tribunals with passing unilateral orders without hearing the parties and without allowing the advocates, a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy directed the government to ensure a fresh hearing in each case if the opposing party objects to the process. “This time, give more publicity to the process. Let the tribunals notify the parties. Give them sufficient time to convey their stand. And then pass orders,” the judges said. Advocate general BS Prasad furnished an affidavit filed by chief secretary Somesh Kumar who informed the court that they had transferred all the cases pending with the revenue courts to the revenue tribunals under the new Pattadar Passbooks Act. Of a total of 16,296 cases transferred thus, as many as 16,294 had already been resolved through the new tribunals, the CS said. The bench pointed out that the tribunals did not allow advocates in 90 per cent of the cases and were allowed only in 10 per cent of cases. Referring to the assurance of the CS in his affidavit, the AG said that those aggrieved with the tribunal orders can approach the tribunals again for a fresh hearing. “The same will be done within one month,” he said. The judges said they would allow the tribunals to overcome the legal difficulties in doing so. “We will help them. They need it because the law does not allow them to revise their orders once they were passed,” they said. “The objective behind heralding the revenue tribunals may be laudable, but we are tweaking it to some extent because we find that the hurried approach is not in tune with the law,” the judges said. “Needless to say, if parties resort to dilatory tactics, the tribunals are free to proceed further,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-picks-holes-in-revenuetribunals-16k-judgments/articleshow/81577545.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Centre wrong in depriving MLA citizenship: State to HC||Hyderabad: The state government on Thursday rushed to the rescue of Vemulavada MLA Chennamaneni Ramesh and urged the high court to protect him from the incorrect actions of the central government. Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili, who was hearing the case, directed all other parties to file their rejoinders to the state’s affidavit within two weeks and adjourned the case. The Union home ministry, following a complaint from Congress leader Adi Srinivas, had inquired into the way MLA Ramesh, who was working in Germany and became its citizen, re-acquired his Indian citizenship to enter the electoral fray in his native Karimnagar district in 2007. Citing the Indian Citizenship rules, the central government gave certain findings that Ramesh had purposefully misled the Indian authorities on the aspect of compulsory 12-month stay in India before he applied for reacquiring his Indian citizenship. He went back to Germany during this period. He left blank the relevant column in the application that sought details about his mandatory stay in India before his citizenship application to Indian authorities. Saying that an MLA trying to mislead was a more serious offence, the home ministry had earlier cancelled Ramesh’s Indian citizenship. On a petition by Ramesh, the high court had earlier stayed the cancellation order and asked the central government to examine the issue from the rules of citizenship that allow people to acquire and continue their citizenship, if it was not a hindrance to the peace in society. The state home department’s principal secretary, in his affidavit, said the same and stated that Ramesh has no history of having been involved in any criminal or anti-national activities. Hence, the central government cannot deprive citizenship to Ramesh because it could do so only in respect of terrorists and persons involved in anti-national activities, he said. “Adi Srinivas is a political opponent to Ramesh and was defeated at the hands of the latter. Acting at the behest of such a person is not correct,” the state home secretary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-wrong-in-depriving-mla-citizenship-state-to-hc/articleshow/81577558.cms||---

He said the decision was taken by the previous government due to shortage of doctors and paramedical staff. He assured that now no primary health centre will be run on PPP mode. Sharma was responding to a question during the Question Hour. He said the previous government had decided to run 70 primary health centres and 26 UPHC in urban areas of the state on PPP mode as per the budget announcement for the year 2015-16. UNder the ‘Run a PHC’ scheme, the these health centres in rural areas will be run by medical colleges, private hospitals, trusts and general practitioners.

---||Delhi||More Covid cases inside sealed zones than outside in Delhi||NEW DELHI: More active Covid cases in the capital are within containment zones as compared to those outside it and the district authorities are tracing 28 to 34 contacts for each positive case to check the recent surge. The highest number of active Covid cases are in South district, followed by North West and South East districts. According to a report on the status of active cases till March 15, Delhi had 2,133 active cases, out of which 1,167 were within containment zones while 966 were outside. South district has 402 active cases, North West 384, South East 278, South West 202 and West 201. North East district has the lowest number of 24 active cases and Shahdara district 84 cases. Only two among the 11 districts have lower than 100 cases though both have higher population density as compared to the rest. A health department official said multiple factors were behind the differences in active cases across the districts. “It is difficult to point out causes for high cases in some districts or low cases in some. The recovery of people with comorbid conditions is usually slower than those without comorbid conditions. It is also a factor behind the rise in active cases,” said the official. The tally is surging for the past several days and the positivity rate is also slowly going up though it’s still below 1%. The number of active cases has, however, tripled in the past one month. On February 19, Delhi had only 1,053 active Covid cases while it rose to 3,165 on March 19. In the same period, the number of containment zones has increased from 649 to 682. The demand for home isolation is also high, with the count currently standing at 1,624 as against 430 witnessed a month ago. An official said all districts had been tracing a high number of contacts in each Covid-positive case. On average, each district is tracing 28 to 34 contacts for each of the positive case. “The contacts include all those who have come in contact with the positive person. Since the movement of people is greater as compared to the lockdown period, the number of contacts is also high. The close family members are tested on priority,” said the official. On average, 31 contacts are being traced for each case. The current situation has also led to a high number of daily tests. Each district is conducting 5,000 to 7,000 daily Covid tests and up to 80,000 tests are being conducted across the capital every day. Experts are insisting on expanding the test net as that will help in early detection and more effective treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-cases-inside-sealed-zones-than-outside/articleshow/81595367.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Lucknow||CBI arrests two directors of Bengal-based chit fund firm||Lucknow: Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) Ranchi unit arrested two directors of a West Bengal-based Chit Fund Company from their hideout in upscale Gomtinagar area of Lucknow on Thursday. The accused were identified as Saket Banerjee and his wife Kamaljeet, both directors of Global Infra Energy Limited. They had been absconding since 2017 after duping small-time investors in Jharkhand of several crore of rupees. A CBI official, privy to the probe, said the couple was part of a 10-member gang, which operated a chit fund company in different districts of Jharkhand from 2010. The head office of the company was based in Burdwan district of West Bengal. After failing to make any gains in West Bengal and Odisha, the accused tried to defraud people in the neighbouring Jharkhand. “The gang members gave lucrative offers to gullible people by promising higher returns of investments as low as Rs 10,000. When the investors got no returns after one year, they tried to approach the directors. After failing to contact them, they lodged an FIR at Mihijam police station in Jamtara district of Jharkhand in 2014,” said the officer. Later, multiple cases were reported in the state, following which a PIL was filed in the Jharkhand high court. In 2017, these cases were transferred to the CBI. CBI sources said, in mere four days in September 2017, as many as 84 FIRs were lodged against 44 companies, which were divided among three different wings at Ranchi CBI unit for the probe. Referring to the case of Global Infra Energy limited, an officer said, the accused had conspired with other directors of the company — Bidyut Gorai, Ranjit Banerjee, Subrata Sarkar, Rangeshwar Ghosh, Koustav Majumder, Paramjeet Kaurasi, Suman Mukherjee and Faruqzzamman Chowdhury — all named in the FIR filed at Mihijam police station along with the two arrested duo. “The accused lured people by promising high returns of their investments, claiming that the company was authorised by the statutory bodies like the RBI and SEBI. The victims were made to part with their money by way of investing in the various deposit schemes of the company. The directors later fled without making payment of the maturity amount,” said the official. The officer said the probe was still pending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cbi-arrests-two-directors-of-bengal-based-chit-fund-firm/articleshow/81578636.cms||---
---||Delhi||Mamata Banerjee pens her support to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on tiff with Centre||NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has come out in support of her Delhi counterpart, Arvind Kejriwal, against the Centre’s Bill that aims to give overarching powers to the lieutenant governor. The Bill is a “surgical strike on the federal structure as enshrined in the Constitution”, Banerjee said. In her letter of support, the Trinamool Congress chief argued for a united fight by non-BJP parties to protect the federal structure and prevent dilution of powers of state governments. Thanking Banerjee, Kejriwal said, “Anyone who supports India and its democracy cannot support this Bill.” In his tweet, Kejriwal added that he would pray for her “handsome victory in the coming (assembly) elections”. Banerjee argued that the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill 2021, introduced in the Lok Sabha, had made a mockery of the letter and spirit of democracy by disempowering the elected government. It “violates the unambiguous verdict by a five-judge Supreme Court bench in 2018, which upheld the pre-eminence of Delhi’s elected government in all matters other than police, public order and land.” She added, “I am writing this letter to convey that my party, Trinamool Congress, and I stand in full solidarity with you in your principled opposition to the Center’s devious, anti-democratic and anti-constitution move... to reduce the status of Delhi chief minister to a subordinate to the lieutenant governor.” Both PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah couldn’t digest BJP’s humiliating defeat at the hands of AAP in the assembly elections and want to govern Delhi by proxy, Banerjee alleged, adding that she would write to all non-BJP CMs to support AAP.

---||Kolhapur||Finish night landing work at Kolhapur airport in 2 months: AAI||KOLHAPUR: The long-pending issue of night landing at the Kolhapur airport is expected to be resolved soon as the Airport Authority of India (AAI) has asked the local administration to complete all the required work within two months. The decision was taken at a meeting in Delhi that was attended by AAI chairperson Anuj Agrwal, committee member Anilkumar Pathak and Rajya Sabha member Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje. District guardian minister Satej Patil also attended the meeting. Apart from night landing, the meeting also discussed other issues like extension of the runway and starting the cargo facility at the airport. It was decided that an expert committee will be sent to Kolhapur to identify the works that need to be taken for night landing facilities and also to review the works that have already been completed. The length of current runway at Kolhapur airport is 1,370 meter and it needs to be extended to 2,300 meter. In addition, the airport approach lights will have to be operational in the night for safe landing of the planes. Now, the local administration is expected to acquire 64 acres for the extension and development of Kolhapur airport. Deepak Kapoor, the managing director of Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC), during his last week’s visit to Kolhapur, had asked the revenue department to expedite the process of land acquisition. Kolhapur airport has experienced a rise in the number of passengers in the recent past, but all the flights are operating only during the day. Recently, air services were started for Ahmedabad and Tirupati and they have evoked good response. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who also holds the finance portfolio, had announced in his budget speech that the state government would provide all financial assistance to the Kolhapur airport. The state government had also deposited a joint measurement fee for the 64 acres with the local administration. Last year, the state government had sanctioned Rs 10 crore for several development works, including the runway extension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/aai-finish-night-landing-work-at-kolhapur-airport-in-2-months/articleshow/81575424.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||City gets little manna from Harish||Hyderabad: Belying all expectations of greater allocations for Hyderabad, the state government gave very little to the city in Thursday’s budget. In the previous budget, the government had allocated Rs 10,000 crore for development of Greater Hyderabad. But, that allocation was more to do with December GHMC elections which the ruling TRS was keen to win. The government allocated Rs 2,200 crore for city drinking water supply, Musi rejuvenation project and Metro Rail project. Senior officials were hopeful that the government would make huge allocations for modernisation of city’s stormwater drainage network and infrastructure works in view of flashfloods in September-October last year. Finance minister Harish Rao said a new drinking water scheme would be taken up for providing water supply to Hyderabad Metropolitan Region. The new scheme, which will be taken up to draw water from Sunkishala near Nagarjuna Sagar to Hyderabad, would augment the future drinking water requirements of the city, he said. “The estimated cost of this project is Rs 1,450 crore,” he said and allocated Rs 725 crore in the budget. Apart from this, the government indicated it would spend Rs 250 crore for providing drinking water for newly-formed colonies within the Outer Ring Road (ORR). “The government has kept up its promise made during the GHMC elections on supply of drinking water. We are supplying 20,000 litres of drinking water free of cost to every household in GHMC limits. An amount of Rs 250 crore is proposed in this budget for supply of free drinking water,” the minister said. Like in the previous budget, this time too, Rs 200 crore has been earmarked for Musi rejuvenation project that includes beautification works. Apart this, for expanding Metro Rail connectivity, Rs 1,000 crore has been allocated in the budget for the first time. The Forum for Good Governance (FGG) has recently written to Harish Rao urging him to allocate Rs 10,000 crore in the 2021-22 budget for improvement of infrastructure in GHMC limits in the wake of flashfloods that wreaked havoc in the city in which 33 people died and property worth crores of rupees was damaged. FGG secretary M Padmanabha Reddy said the city’s population has touched one crore and 60% of the state’s wealth is generated from Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-gets-little-manna-from-harish/articleshow/81577567.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Pune||Panel to study inclusion of Std XII scores with CET||Pune: Concentrating on just the entrance examinations and ignoring standard XII board exams may not work in the future. The state government has decided to form a committee which will check how to incorporate the standard XII board exam marks along with entrance exam marks for admission to professional courses, besides the weightage to be given to scores in both exams. Experts have mixed feelings about the move as some feel this will dilute the quality of students in professional courses.On Wednesday, a meeting by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on agriculture education led to the discussion on giving weightage to standard XII marks along with the Common Entrance Test marks for admission to all professional courses. A decision was also taken to constitute an expert committee to decide the policy on agriculture education in the state. Chintamani Joshi, commissioner of state CET cell, said, “In the discussion, a point was raised that many students in class XII only study for entrance examinations and ignore their standard XII studies which should not be the case ideally. Hence a committee will be formed to decide incorporation of the standard XII exam marks along with CET marks for admissions to professional courses. The report will be submitted to the state by April 30.” However, there is no clarity on when and whether there will be changes in the admission process only after submission of the report.W N Gade, former vice chancellor of Savitribai Phule Pune University, said it was not a good move as nationally, admissions to all professional colleges are based on entrance examinations. “Considering the standard XII exam marks is an outdated concept. One cannot establish the aptitude and understanding of the student based on those marks. Moreover, there are internal marks given to these students which have no transparency and there are many boards. Hence, we should stick to the standard practice of CET marks for admission,” said Gade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/panel-to-study-inclusion-of-std-xii-scores-with-cet/articleshow/81576526.cms||Ardhra Nair

Article 239A of the Constitution clearly states that Delhi will have its government, which will form a vidhan sabha and the elected government will be accountable to it,” Jain said. “Now the Centre wants to change Delhi’s elected government with the lieutenant governor,” he added.“The real reason why the central government is stressing to bring this change is that it wants to delay the developmental work in Delhi,” he alleged. “We will continue to work for the welfare of the people of Delhi, come what may.” When all files used to go to the LG following a high court verdict, the files of mohalla clinic, CCTV cameras and Wi-Fi stood pending with him for a long time, he pointed out. To get these cleared, he had protested at the LG’s house along with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia and cabinet colleague Gopal Rai and even went on a hunger strike with Sisodia for 11 days, Jain added.The minister said that in a healthy democracy, there should be healthy competition. “If you want to compete with us, work better than us. If we have made 200 units of electricity free in Delhi, you make 400 units free in BJP-run states.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-delaying-citys-development-says-jain/articleshow/81576535.cms||---

---||Pune||Uncertainty, delay mess up college yr for agri courses||Pune: Higher education in agriculture courses in the state has been hit by uncertainty and delays as the academic year will now begin on April 1. It was to start six months ago. The lockdown postponed admissions to all courses last year, followed by incessant delays by the state Common Entrance Test cell in implementing the Centralised Admission Process. The delay has also resulted in fewer admissions this year as only 45% of the seats have been filled till now, with more rounds to go. The officials said both semesters are expected to end by December 31. Harihar Kausadikar, director (extension and resource development) with the Maharashtra Council Of Agricultural Education And Research, Pune said the delays have negatively impacted the admissions this year. “In the last five years, we have had almost 100% admissions. We have 15,250 seats for various BSc in agriculture courses. Generally, every year we get around 70,000 applications but this year, the number was just half at 38,000,” Kausadikar said. Another official blamed the organisation chosen to conduct the CAP rounds for all the problems. “Even less number of forms would not have mattered but with a new organisation being chosen for conducting the CAP rounds, the entire process went for a toss. There were so many delays and so many technical problems that many students did not even apply. We are hoping that the last round, which is a college-level round will yield better admissions,” an official who did not wish to be named said. When higher and technical education minister Uday Samant had come to Pune for an open house last month, he had said that a committee has been set up to look into the technical glitches during the CAP rounds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/uncertainty-delay-mess-up-college-yr-for-agri-courses/articleshow/81576543.cms||Ardhra Nair

Sharing the information, agriculture minister and newly-appointed government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said, “The government is committed to organising a grand and divine Kumbh. Some projects related to roads, electricity, drinking water and toilets, are yet to be completed. Therefore, the cabinet has provided relaxation in the procurement manuals to speed up the projects on time.”  The state cabinet also approved the proposed extension of the contract awarded to Fortis Healthcare for one year. On March 8, 2011, Fortis Healthcare was awarded a 10-year contract to set up a centre at Deen Dayal Upadhyay (Coronation) Hospital. The contract expired on March 7 this year. “There is a condition that the hospital will provide facilities only to the people of Uttarakhand,” added the minister. In another decision, the cabinet approved the change of name of the confidential department to the department of council of ministers. Also, the state cabinet has approved Rs 1 crore for soil testing and other related works for the proposed Kotdwar Medical College in Pauri district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-cabinet-relaxes-procurement-manuals-to-speed-up-kumbh-related-projects/articleshow/81575434.cms||Kautilya Singh

Speaking on the eve of the fourth anniversary the BJP government in the state, Singh claimed that the UP government followed the path of ‘Antyoday’ in ensuring that welfare schemes reach the last person in the queue. He said, the electorate had voted for a ‘double engine’ government with the BJP at the Centre and the state. It is because of this that as many as 44 schemes of the Centre are being implemented in the state. Singh said, the state was in a bad condition when the party came to power in 2017. “Lawlessness was at its peak, people were forced to migrate and coffers of the state were virtually empty... BJP pursued the policy of ‘sabka saath, sabka vishwas’ to resurrect the state from a deplorable condition.” He praised the CM for taking the challenges head on and putting the state on a growth trajectory. “The state is free of anarchy and has become one of the favourite destinations for the industries and investment,” he said, pointing out how the state recently achieved the second position in ease of doing business in the country. The UP BJP chief said, the policy of zero toleration against corruption and crime has been the hallmark of the state government. He said, the transparency in food distribution, rural development, uninterrupted power supply, quality education, tourism development and cow conservation have driven the state on the path of growth and prosperity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-upheld-states-cultural-spiritual-ethos-up-bjp-chief/articleshow/81578647.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Fire NOC in hospitals: Action sought against CFO||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court was requested on Thursday to take action against the chief fire officer (CFO) for allegedly misleading the court by presenting wrong figures of the fire NOCs issued to the hospitals in the city. The Gujarat high court had directed the authorities to ensure that all hospitals should have fire NOCs with adequate firefighting equipment in place. This was with regard to a PIL seeking action against the responsible in the Shrey Hospital fire tragedy and for proper implementation of the fire safety norms. Petitioner advocate Amit Panchal filed an affidavit in response to two reports filed by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) chief fire officer which reflected discrepancy in number of hospitals and the claims made earlier about the number of NOCs issued to the hospitals. The petitioner submitted that the AMC claimed that there are 2,247 hospitals in municipal limits, and 1,960 hospitals have been issued fire NOCs. There are 170 hospitals that are closed at present. Advocate Panchal submitted that there was no detail about 117 hospitals in the report. During a hearing, the lawyer had claimed that AMC’s figures were incorrect. By comparing the two reports filed by the chief fire officer on affidavits, the petitioner stated that his apprehension was justified and the court was being misled. He requested the court “to take appropriate steps against Respondent No 4 (chief fire officer) in public interest to prevent this court from being misled with regard to the figure of the number of hospitals and high rise buildings in the city”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fire-noc-in-hospitals-action-sought-against-cfo/articleshow/81576529.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||MP raises waqf land grab issue in Parliament, demands CBI probe||Aurangabad: Raising the issue of waqf lands being grabbed, Aurangabad MP and waqf member Imtiaz Jaleel demanded a CBI probe in the illegal sale, transfer, development and encroachment of the waqf properties across Maharashtra. He highlighted the example of the Jalna Road-based prime plot (CTS number 12503) and said the plot was illegally developed by a handful of builders in connivance with land sharks and officials from different government departments. This one project alone has a valuation of over Rs 100 crores, and against each of the illegal transactions carried out at the developed site, waqf is getting a meager of Rs 1.5 lakh. Citing a landmark Supreme Court judgment, Jaleel said: “The SC has clearly stated that once a waqf is always a waqf. In Maharashtra, a total of 93,000 hectares is under the waqf , but unfortunately, most of this is only on paper. Most of these lands have been usurped, encroached upon and even sold off by the builders, land sharks and even politicians. Officials in the land record office, the sub-registrar’s office, the civic body, the revenue authorities, including talathis and circle officers, have played a role in the illegal transfer and sale of these waqf properties.” He alleged that most of these properties were sold, purchased and even encroached upon during the consecutive Congress and NCP governments. “Now, both these parties are again in government in the state. Therefore, we are less hopeful of any action being initiated in the waqf land scams in Maharashtra. If the CBI carries out a probe, I am sure that the role of several politicians, including those in the Congress and NCP, will come to the fore,” said Jaleel. After raising the issue in Parliament, the MP said: “Waqf lands are meant for the welfare and sustenance of the widows, orphans, unemployed and the needy. But due to the alleged connivance of the authorities, these lands are being usurped by builders and land sharks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mp-raises-waqf-land-grab-issue-in-parliament-demands-cbi-probe/articleshow/81575436.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The chief minister made a slew of new announcements including a huge hike on MLA area development fund which was raised to Rs 5 crore from Rs 2.25 crore. The only dissenting voice was of revenue minister Harish Chaudhary. He said when the country was grappling with Covid and even MP area development funds had been frozen, it was inappropriate for such a huge hike. The chief minister said his government had given employment to 97,000 youths so far while recruitment of about 73,000 was in various stages. Gehlot announced renaming of universal health scheme worth Rs 3,500 crore as CM Chiranjeevi Yojna and said registrations will start from April 1. Gehlot in his reply targeted the central government. He said the Centre only paid lip service to co-operative federalism. He said the Centre had been not only curtailing its share in the centrally sponsored schemes but is not fulfilling its obligations under the GST putting the state finances under strain. The chief minister sought cooperation of the opposition in getting approval from the Centre for the ambitious eastrn Rajasthan canal project (ERCP) and to get preferential treatment to the state in the Jal Jeevan mission. He demanded the Centre should bear 90 per cent of the cost considering the topography and difficult climatic conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mla-fund-raised-to-rs-5-crore/articleshow/81576555.cms||---

The NSUT administration, however, said that online exams were not feasible now and all safety measures were in place for the offline exams. “It is necessary that since we have safety measures in place, we conduct physical exams. Tomorrow, UGC or AICTE may not approve degrees or student promotion based on online exam.

He, however, cautioned against any complacency and urged people to wear masks and maintain social distancing.Jain said Delhi’s positivity rate was 0.6% on Wednesday, which was the lowest compared with states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana. “The positivity rate is between 0.6% and 0.8%, and since the past two months, it is under 1%. For the past five months, it’s been under 5%,” he pointed out.Stressing that Delhi government is careful, Jain said, “The situation is well within control as compared with other states. But I will still emphasise about staying cautious of the novel coronavirus.” The minister said while the positivity rate in Delhi was 0.6% on Wednesday, the same was 19.3% in Maharashtra, 4.9% in Punjab, 4.8% in Madhya Pradesh, 3.4% in Kerala, 2.8%in Haryana and 1.9% in Gujarat. On the rise in cases just before the festive season, Jain said “the benchmark set by World Health Organization is 1%, 5% and above 5%. Right now the positivity rate is below 1% and the fluctuation in the positivity rate is normal” as the virus was still there. “Ahead of the festive season, people get relaxed and it is my humble request to all to not defy the precautions,” he added. The testing capacity in Delhi has been increased to 80,000 per day, which, Jain said, is five times of the national average and is the highest in the country. “That’s why we can identify and effectively treat the active cases.” The government is also effectively monitoring people coming from other states, Jain said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/positivity-rate-low-no-reason-to-panic-jain/articleshow/81576544.cms||Sidharatha Roy

This would not have been possible had Auda not reorganized land around Ahmedabad’s periphery by an art which planners call ‘land reconstitution.’ For the first time AUDA revealed that since 1999, 83 major Land Reconstitution (LR) plans totalling an area of 51.6 sq miles or 13,376 hectare had been completed and that additionally 48 new local area plans totalling to 26.3 square miles or 6,803 hectares are under various stages of preparation in the AUDA region. “On an annual basis, this is equivalent of supplying 3.9 sq miles per year of services land,” said a senior AUDA official. The Land Reconstitution (LR) process was used extensively according to Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act for SP Ring Road in 1999. “In the initial days of the SP Ring Road AUDA wanted a 52m-wide corridor with 120m-wide road and 200m-wide green belt on both sides of the road,” said the AUDA official. He added, “Initially the plan was to acquire a 1,640 feet wide and about 31 mile long corridor using compulsory purchase for reserving the rights of way.” This according to the AUDA official would have caused huge displacement with large scale acquisition. “The very first notification for land acquisition for SP Ring Road invited 40,000 public objections,” said the AUDA official in the town planning division. Most of the land parcels were irregular and devoid of access . These plots were painstakingly reconstituted to avoid land acquisition and disputes. The acquisition ranged from smaller land holdings that together accumulated into 185 acres in more populated areas like Ambli and Shilaj villages while layouts involving large land parcel holdings together constituted 2,770 acres. these large land holdings had less population and were around areas like Sarkhej and Okaf-Makarba. “In all some 22,700 acres of service land was available to us around SP Ring Road in a self-financing manner,” said the AUDA official. Today this same technique is being used to make available some 6,803 hectares of land for development purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/auda-readying-6-8k-hectares-for-utilities/articleshow/81576556.cms||---

Additional senior civil judge Kiritkumar Gohel issued the direction while hearing plea of a cheating victim who had approached the court alleging that police did not register his complaint despite it being a criminal case. Court ordered that Patel be booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). It also ordered a deputy commissioner level officer to investigate the case. According to case details, Jaydeep Nathani had approached court alleging that despite him submitting an application of cheating against his business associate on September 28, 2020, the Sarthana police did not register an FIR in the case. After a preliminary inquiry, Sarthana police had closed the case saying that the nature of the complaint was civil in nature and not criminal. In its order, the senior civil judge observed that the preliminary inquiry should have been completed in seven days of receiving the complaint and the parameter of a preliminary inquiry should be to decide if a cognizable offence can be registered or not. “In this case, the dispute is between two business associates and police initially found that it is a financial matter hence an offence was not registered. It seems the fault on part of the police is the inquiry was not completed within seven days.

She said the textbook contains personal opinions rather than facts and, the language is poor. For example, the textbook says maize is pollinated by wind when it is an angiosperm (a flowering plant that has seeds enclosed by fruits which develop from carpels). It adds that a giraffe survives in famine and heat when it should say the African desert.

Maharashtra is regarded as a most advanced state in the country and it would be a matter of disgrace for the educational field if academicians outside the state were to see these mistakes.” Balbharati’s director Dinkar Patil said the matter would be studied and corrections would be incorporated in the new version. Subject experts from Savitribai Phule Pune University supported Sane’s claims and said the textbook must be reviewed immediately. Rajesh Gacche, head of the department of biotechnology, said the errors pointed out by the senior academician are apt and need immediate rectification. “Final conceptual proof reading should be conducted with seriousness so that mistakes can be minimized,” he added. Last year, Sane had carried out a similar exercise for the biology textbook for standard XI and pointed out equally appalling errors. The Balbharati had duly corrected the errors in the new version. Sane also pointed out that the rulesof singular and plural were glaringly missing in the standard XII textbook in some passages andtenseswere notin agreement. “English is the medium of teachingin thescience stream and hence the grammar in the textbooks should have been clean,” she said. Balbharati has an expert group of 25 members that decide, review and take decisions on thecontentof eachtextbook published. Sane said none of the members could see the mistakes and the books have been published with more than 100 errors. “The diagrams are extremely funny in some cases. For instance, on page 65, a coloured image of ‘Bonellia viridis’ is given. It looks like some animal is crossing a bridge. Experts must refer to some standard books and not go wrong with images,” Sane said. Patil said they have received Sane’s report and all the corrections would be duly made in the next version. “Suggestions are sought every year anderrors,changes and rectifications pointed out are incorporated in the improved version of thetextbook.Thesecorrections are being reviewed by the committee and just like last year, most of it would be duly incorporated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hsc-biology-textbook-strewn-with-facts-syntax-spelling-errors/articleshow/81576585.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Officers said the suspect had left behind barely any trail of evidence. Therefore, the preliminary probe was handed over to the crime branch.City Chowk police station’s senior inspector Sambhaji Pawar told TOI: “This case appears to be just the tip of an iceberg. We are in the process of collecting corroborative evidence to arrest the suspect, who is a resident of the Yunus Colony area.”As per the complaint lodged by Shaikh Malik Ahmed, a 32-year-old resident of the Subhedari Guest House area, in 2010, the suspect told him that he had bagged a tender for running Setu Suvidha centres in Ranjangaon Shenpunji, Maliwada and Gandheli. The suspect then asked Malik if he was interested in operating the centres. The suspect said that he will charge Rs 2.5 lakh for the first centre and Rs 1.5 lakh each for the subsequent ones. The suspect allegedly allotted the Ranjangaon centre to Shaikh, while the other two centres were given to Syed Mehraj and Shaikh Afroz.When they did not get the allotted centres, the three men sought their money back, but the suspect kept dilly-dallying. The trio had earlier lodged a complaint in 2017, but in vain. Recently, they reached out to police commissioner Nikhil Gupta, who ordered the crime branch to ascertain the facts. After the probe indicated the suspect’s role, a case was registered on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sethu-suvidha-scam-aurangabad-man-booked-for-duping-3-people-of-rs-5-5-lakh/articleshow/81575457.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Mumbai||BMC’s decision to pay developers with credit notes, TDR draws flak||MUMBAI: Facing a massive funds crunch after a year oif Covud, the BMC has decided to go cashless for its Rs 8,800 crore housing plan for project-affected persons (PAPs). For the first time, the BMC will give out credit notes instead of money to contractors who will construct 12,000 housing units for PAPs. The developer may use these credit notes to pay municipal taxes and premiums to the BMC, or even sell the credit notes to other developers. The opposition alleged that this will turn out to be a Rs 9,000 crore scam since the BMC will lose income when developers start paying their premiums using the credit notes at a time when the BMC is in a financial crisis. Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh wrote to CM Uddhav Thackeray asking him to scrap the plan. As per the plan, land owners who own land parcels reserved for PAPs or housing for the dishoused have to come forward and offer their lands to the BMC. These owners must also do the construction for the BMC and hand it over. The BMC will house people affected by its various infrastructure projects like road widening, laying of drains, constructions of flyovers and bridges, among others. Officials said the BMC has shortlisted developers to build 12,000 PAP units of 27.88sqm in five zones. “We will pay the land owners or developers land TDR for the land, construction TDR for the cost of construction, and by way of credit notes for the premium or profit that they charge us. The value of the credit notes is Rs 6,000 crore and of the land TDR and TDR is around Rs 2,800 crore. In all we will pay them Rs 8,800 crore in a phased manner,” said an official. “The BMC has awarded a contract for construction of homes of a similar size and nature as the PAP units as part of its Ashray Yojana scheme. Here the cost is only Rs 2,000 crore for construction of 12,000 units. So there is a massive disparity in cost. Concept of credit notes needs to be discussed at the highest level and needs detailed financial examination. Handing out credit notes can lead to the BMC losing sight of the need to curtail expenditure. The BMC will lose income of around Rs 2,000 crore per year. The municipal commissioner did not inform us about credit notes in his budget in February,” Shaikh said in his letter. “Instead of paying out Rs 9,000 crore for 12,000 units, the BMC can pay out the project-affected persons as per the ready reckoner rates of the area. This will work out to be much more cost effective. This entire scheme is a Rs 9000 crore scam and will turn out to be a white elephant for the BMC,” Shaikh further said in the letter. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal refused to comment on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaibmcs-decision-to-pay-developers-with-credit-notes-tdr-draws-flak/articleshow/81576589.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The alumni council also held a meeting to discuss the future course of action to “protect the academic freedom in the university”. They also discussed how faculty members and students could get representation in the management. Sources said a few trustees of the university also met Mehta. The students’ body had issued a form showing solidarity with the two professors. While the alumni council and students signed the form, it was also open to all those who wanted to express their solidarity. A statement from the students said, “We firmly believe that as members and stakeholders of the Ashokan community, we should be able to demand transparency from the founders and trustees regarding the events that have taken place. We strongly condemn the conditions that led to the resignations and lack of transparency from the university administration. Professors Mehta and Subramanian are invaluable members of the Ashokan community and we are extremely saddened that they submitted their resignations.” As a part of their demands, the students want the university to re-offer Mehta his position. They also want the process of resignation to be made more transparent. “The events that transpired point to failure on the part of the chancellor and vice-chancellor in protecting the university’s faculty members from external pressures. More importantly, it also points towards the failure of the founders to ensure the same. We are concerned about the larger implications this has on the freedom of speech for Ashoka’s students and faculty. This is not the first time that professors have come under fire for their opinions and/or their course content,” said the statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stir-by-ashoka-univ-students-on-alumni-map-future-action/articleshow/81595406.cms||---

On the perceived disagreement over the preference of the seats to the alliance parties and choice of candidates in the DMK, Nehru said that DMK has done fair enough to the Congress and other alliance partners. “The selection of candidates comes under the purview of the president. Others have no authority to interfere in the decision. They can no longer be in the party by scolding the president. So, they are scolding me.” He also maintained that the alliance parties in the DMK-led secular progressive alliance remain united. Nehru also dismissed the allegation that Tamil Nadu was reeling under power shortage during the DMK regime. “Tamil Nadu is a power surplus state because of the schemes brought in by the DMK government,” he said asking whether the AIADMK government led by Edappadi K Palaniswami had implemented any new power project. It is the fifth straight time that he is contesting from the Trichy West constituency since 2006. Of the four elections including a by-election in 2011, Nehru won twice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/dmk-never-tried-to-topple-aiadmk-govt-says-nehru/articleshow/81577583.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

She also accused her husband and in-laws of harassing her physically and mentally. A complaint in this regard was filed with the Women’s Police (West) on Wednesday. In the FIR, she states that her husband, a resident of Naranpura, picked a fight with her for the first time during their first night in 2013 when he gave her “some weird gift”. When she expressed her displeasure about the gift, he allegedly pushed her against a wall and injured her. Later, she expressed a desire to go to honeymoon to some exotic place. Her father-in-law allegedly took objection to this, saying they must not spend money on honeymoon. A month later, her husband took her to Goa. She alleged that during their honeymoon, they were supposed to go out. “When I was getting ready, he began fighting with me saying I was taking a long time to dress up. When I tried to pacify him, he pinched me badly all over my body,” she said in the FIR. She also alleged that her husband and in-laws did not allow her to go for higher studies and did not permit her to get a job. Later, she started a food delivery business but her husband and in-laws did not like that too and taunted her constantly.

---||Lucknow||Akhilesh: Four years of zero governance, soaring crime||Lucknow: Describing the four years of BJP rule in Uttar Pradesh as an epitome of gross misrule, rampant corruption, rising crime and failure at all fronts, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday said it was nothing less than Uttar Pradesh being BJP’s ‘andher nagri’ (lawless state) with ‘char saal chaupat raj’ (four years of zero governance). “One can imagine the state of affairs prevailing in the state from the fact that recently BJP leaders and MLAs at the party’s working committee meeting described tehsils and police stations as places where nothing moves without paying bribes,” the former UP chief minister said, adding: “If this is the experience of ruling party leaders, one can imagine what the common man must be going through .” The SP chief said BJP’s four years of aimless governance has brought the state to a position where 11 of the 22 most polluted cities in the world happen to be from UP as per latest media reports. He said the deterioration is overall and rampant. “As per statistics the unemployment rate, which was 5.92 per cent in 2018 has shot up to 9.9 per cent in 2019,” he said. During the SP regime cycle tracks were constructed and projects like Gomti Riverfront, Etawah Lion Safari, Janeshwar Mishra Park and Metro rail were executed, he said, adding the main aim of strengthening the public transport system was to check the rising pollution and offer a clean environment. However, many of these projects were abandoned. Had all the projects launched by the SP government been completed by the ruling BJP, the state government could have avoided the embarrassment that it is facing today at the international level, the SP chief added. The former UP CM said farmers have been hit the worst during the BJP rule. “The farmers are not getting the MSP that the government has announced. They were promised that the government will do everything to double farmers’ income, but they are finding it hard to sell their produce even at the cost price. Around Rs 10,000 crore are due on cane growers. The government has turned a deaf ear to their demand, seeking withdrawal of farm laws despite the community staging protests “Instances of hooch deaths are on the rise, reflecting the standards of policing in the state. The government has done absolutely nothing to increase production of electricity. On the contrary the government went ahead to purchase smart meters and eventually ended up with a scam,” he said. Attacking the BJP government on the law and order, he said in UP the rate of crime against women and minor girls is the highest in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-four-years-of-zero-governance-soaring-crime/articleshow/81578681.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Trichy||20 DMK candidates are leaders’ kin: EPS||Nagappattinam: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Thursday raked up dynastic politics to launch a frontal attack on DMK and its chief M K Stalin, saying the party had fielded 20 candidates who are family members of its leaders. Terming DMK as a corporate company with Stalin as chairman and family members constituting the board of directors, he said people will reject the party. EPS said that as a person who began as a farmer and went on to become the chief minister, he wanted to put an end to dynasty politics to enable everyone to reach the heights of power. “DMK is fully steeped in dynasty politics. The party has fielded 20 candidates from the families of the leaders. Functionaries follow the path of the leader and DMK obviously is not concerned about the people. The intention of its leaders is to make their heirs come to power,” he said. The CM campaigned in Thiruthuraipoondi, Vedaranyam, Nagappattinam, Sembanarkovil, Mayiladuthurai and Sirkazhi for candidates of the AIADMK alliance. Dismissing Stalin’s allegation of heirs being promoted in AIADMK too, EPS sought to differentiate it thus: “Our heirs may become MLAs but it is wrong if the heirs head the party. Those who are working for the party should become the head of the party, but in DMK it was Karunanidhi, then Stalin and Udhayanidhi Stalin.” He described DMK as a corporate company with Stalin as chairman and Kanimozhi, Dayanidhi Maran and Udhayanidhi Stalin as board of directors. He reiterated that Stalin can never become the CM and DMK cannot come to power for 100 years. Stating that AIADMK was determined to help rural students in NEET by giving them 7.5 % internal reservation, Palaniswami said the AIADMK would put up a continuous fight to cancel NEET. “We are conducting NEET because of the court order but DMK had allowed NEET when it was part of the Congress government at the Centre in 2010,” he said. Accusing the DMK MLAs of creating ruckus in the assembly instead of speaking about the people, EPS said Stalin complained about AIADMK to cover up the corruptions cases against 13 former ministers of DMK.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/20-dmk-candidates-are-leaders-kin-eps/articleshow/81577584.cms||---

A first-generation politician in his family, Veerasakthi said he preferred his mother over others as she, as a single mother, was instrumental in educating him. The 48-year-old businessman, who owns a hotel and pharmacies in the city, said he made it clear among his party functionaries that his mother D Maragathavalli will be one of the two to accompany him. The elderly woman and MNM Trichy central district secretary Suresh accompanied Veerasakthi to the Trichy corporation’s zonal office in Palakkarai for the important occasion. “After my father left us when I was a child, it was my mother who worked as a tailor on daily wages to support my education. It was not just a sentimental act but an effort to acknowledge the hardships she faced as a single mother,” Veerasakthi told TOI. Many candidates choose their party leaders and alliance party representatives to accompany them on the occasion. However, this time, the ECI’s Covid protocol allows only two people to come with a candidate. Veerasakthi said that initially he was a salesman for a pharmaceutical company who later became an entrepreneur. “I was initially not interested in his political foray as I did not want him to spend his hard-earned money on it. Later, I was convinced that the common people should also enter politics, ” Maragathavalli said. Meanwhile, the MNM candidate’s gesture has won the hearts and respects of local people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/candidate-takes-mom-along-to-file-papers-recalls-her-sacrifices/articleshow/81577591.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Hyderabad||MLAs and MLCs to get Rs 5 cr fund each||Hyderabad: Amid allegations about legislators not utilising their constituency funds optimally, the Telangana government enhanced the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) from Rs 3 crore to Rs 5 crore a year, on Thursday, announcing a total allocation of Rs 800 crore towards CDF in the 2021-22 budget. To be disbursed among all MLAs and MLCs, the money can be used for any developmental work in their constituencies, like construction of school buildings, roads etc. While state finance minister, T Harish Rao, in his budget speech said that guidelines for the use of these funds will be released shortly, there has been some criticism over MLAs and MLCs not utilising their funds or recommending works only by the end of the financial year, for fear of the corpus lapsing. In 2019, the state government had even stalled the development fund but revived in last year when many works, proposed by MLAs in their constituencies, could not be completed due to financial crisis induced by the lockdown. Interestingly, few years ago, the government has created a CM’s special development fund with about Rs 5,000 crore, but it was discontinued. “Nowhere in the country are there offices for MLAs in their constituencies. Until now, MLAs were using their residences as offices but the Telangana government has built camp offices for all MLAs. So far, construction of offices have been completed in 89 assembly constituencies,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mlas-and-mlcs-to-get-rs-5-cr-fund-each/articleshow/81577592.cms||Koride Mahesh

It is learnt that Waze exercised such control that some of the officers higher in rank, like inspectors and senior inspectors of the crime branch units, received orders directly from him. Some officers told TOI it was humiliating to receive directions from a junior officer who wielded clout. Joint CP (crime) Milind Bharambe has reportedly conveyed this to the home department in the discussions following the Waze episode. Bharambe did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. Some officers believed Waze was just conveying orders from senior officers and followed it. An officer said they were all aware about his proximity to city police chief Parambir Singh who was shunted out on Wednesday. A police officer close to Singh said he just gave Waze a chance to start afresh after suspension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaicase-fallout-rejig-at-crime-branch-likely/articleshow/81576615.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Trichy||DMK tries to woo centraldists with 335 promises||Trichy: The district-level manifesto released by DMK for all the 38 districts in the state has touched upon several sectors, mainly health, solid waste and sewage management, water conservation and new infrastructure. The opposition party has listed 335 promises for the nine central districts with the most number of assurances for Thanjavur district. However, several key assurances anticipated for Trichy such as integrated bus terminus (IBT) and shifting wholesale operations of Gandhi market to city outskirts were missing. Shifting of women’s prison in the heart of the city near Marakkadai to the outskirts has been proposed by the party. The proposal was a long-standing demand of vegetable traders in Gandhi market who were batting for retrieving the prison space so that it can be used as market instead of relocating the market to the Kallikudi integrated market complex. In the MSME sector, DMK has promised to constitute a committee comprising MSME entrepreneurs, Bhel Trichy and government departments to address discrepancies. The manifesto for Trichy district has stressed on the need to revive the Elcot IT park at Navalpattu and increase the number of IT and ITES firms operating here. “There is no word on upgrading the government medical college hospital in the city. The manifesto is also silent on installing new flyovers to decongest traffic. Proposal to establish an arts college in Manapparai is a welcome move,” Sakthivel Rengasamy, a resident of Manapparai, said. The party has proposed a new semi ring road connecting Thanjavur NH with Chennai NH via Vengur. Though a proposal on integrated bus terminus is missing, Thuraiyur was promised a new bus stand on the outskirts. The party was also silent on the utilisation of Kallikudi integrated vegetable market facility. “Our leaders are repeatedly talking about setting up IBT for Trichy city once we assume power. Other announcements that have not found a place in the manifesto will also be implemented,” a source in DMK camp said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/dmk-tries-to-woo-centraldists-with-335-promises/articleshow/81577589.cms||Deepak Karthik

A Deccan Gymkhana police team, including senior inspector Muralidhar Karpe and sub-inspector Babasaheb Zarekar, nabbed the realtor, Jagdish Hiralal Unecha (58), from Bhosalenagar off Ganeshkhind Road. The wife and son of the realtor have also been booked.“Unecha is into the business of plot schemes as well as construction,” said Karpe. His office is located in the Deccan area.Karpe said, “In 2015, Unecha had floated a financial scheme promising handsome returns to people investing in it. As of now, we have received only one complaint but the possibility of some more investors coming forward to lodge their complaints with us cannot be ruled out.”He said, “We conducted a search at Unecha’s office and found many receipts stating that he had accepted money from people. We have invoked provisions of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act, along with cheating and criminal breach of trust in the case.”Sub-inspector Zarekar said “The complainant is a resident of the Sinhagad Road area. After going through the scheme of Unecha promising monthly benefits to investors, he invested Rs1 crore in it. The architect received monthly benefits only till September 2016. The victim’s investment amount (Rs1 crore) was supposed to mature in January 2021 but Unecha did not return it also. The architect did not receive the interest amount of Rs91 lakh either.”Karpe said, “The victim had approached the police last week. After studying his complaint application, we registered the case and arrested the realtor, Unecha. We appeal to people at large to approach the police if they have been cheated by Unecha.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/developer-arrested-on-charge-of-duping-architect-of-rs-1-9cr-with-hefty-returns-bait/articleshow/81576598.cms||---

A senior criminal lawyer having expertise in wildlife and forest-related crimes conducted the training session. “It has been observed that many wildlife criminals are acquitted by court due to lack of law-related knowledge of the forest guards. The training will be helpful in improving legal proceedings which in turn will pave the way for the wildlife criminals’ definite conviction by the court,” said Naveen Khandelwal, PTR’s deputy director. “The forest guards have to prepare reports regarding forest and the wildlife crimes, including the recovery and the seizure report, the arrest memo and the preliminary offence report. These reports form the base for the trial of the criminal. Therefore, knowledge of legal aspects is necessary,” the forest official said. In the next training session, forest inspectors will undergo training on the same lines, Khandelwal said. At the training session, forest guards were informed about various IPC sections and provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act and the Indian Forest Act, said Naresh Kumar, senior project officer, World Wide Fund-India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/in-a-first-ptr-forest-guards-learn-about-legal-aspects-of-wildlife-crime/articleshow/81575473.cms||Keshav Agarwal
---||Delhi||Covid-19 re-infection threat high for 65+: Study||NEW DELHI: People over the age of 65 are at greater risk of catching Covid-19 again, with only 47% protection against repeat infection compared with 80% for younger people. This has been confirmed in the first large-scale study of Covid-19 reinfections published in The Lancet. The researchers say these findings underline that measures to protect the elderly, including social distancing and vaccinations, are essential even if people have already been diagnosed with the viral infection. The study, which is based on an analysis of the data collected as part of Denmark’s national Covid-19 strategy during the first and the second wave of the outbreak, also suggests that people who have had the virus should still be vaccinated, as natural protection – particularly among the elderly – cannot be relied upon. “Our study confirms what a number of others appeared to suggest: reinfection with Covid-19 is rare in younger, healthy people, but the elderly people are at greater risk of catching it again. Since older people are also more likely to experience severe disease symptoms, and sadly die, our findings make clear how important it is to implement policies to protect the elderly during the pandemic,” Dr Steen Ethelberg, the lead author, said. Why are the elderly people at higher risk of re-infection? The Danish researchers say it could be explained by natural age-related changes in the immune system of older adults. “These changes affect both the innate and adaptive immune system and coordination of immune responses, and hence result in older people being more susceptible to emerging infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other viruses,” they add. “Further studies are needed to assess how protection against repeat infection might vary with different Covid-19 strains.” In line with findings from other studies, the authors identified no evidence that protection against repeat infection with Covid-19 waned within six months. Because Covid-19 was only identified in December 2019, the period of protective immunity conferred by infection has still to be determined. Dr Daniela Michlmayr from the Staten Serum Institut, Denmark said: “In our study, we did not identify anything to indicate that protection against reinfection declines within six months of having Covid-19.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/re-infection-threat-high-for-65-study/articleshow/81576621.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Delhi||607 new Covid cases in Delhi, the highest in nearly 2 and a half months||NEW DELHI: Delhi on Thursday recorded 607 new Covid-19 cases, the highest in about two and a half months, while one more fatality pushed the overall death toll to 10,949. The number of active cases stands at 2,924, from 2,702 a day ago, according to Delhi government’s health bulletin. The new cases came out of 80,253 tests, including 48,737 RT-PCR and 31,516 rapid antigen tests, health officials said, adding that the infection tally has touched 6,45,632 — the sixth highest in the country. The positivity rate — the number of positive cases from those tested — stands at 0.76%. On Wednesday, it was 0.66%. In terms of fatalities, Delhi stands fourth. “There is a clear trend of rise in new cases. It could get worse in the days to come, if we don’t follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Also, genomic testing needs to be pursued aggressively in areas with a cluster of new cases to rule out the possibility of spread of newer variants of novel coronavirus,” said Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant of internal medicine at Apollo hospital. While the first case was recorded in Delhi on March 2 last year, the outbreak peaked about four months later with over 2,000 daily cases in June. The peak continued for nearly five months. The situation improved dramatically since December, and in February, the daily cases were around 140. However, since March 1, the count has been on the rise, and the city has recorded 6,343 cases over the past 18 days, averaging a daily tally of around 352 cases. The demand for Covid beds has also gone up significantly. On Thursday, the Delhi Corona app showed 806 out of the 5,711 Covid beds were occupied, with the occupancy of ICU beds with ventilator and without ventilator support standing at 160 and 174, respectively. Around 1,519 patients are under home isolation. “We need to act fast in putting in place containment and contact tracing measures to prevent another potential crisis. Testing must remain high,” said a senior doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/607-new-covid-cases-the-highest-in-nearly-2-and-a-half-months/articleshow/81576617.cms||---

OFT said that 11,500 locally-made Trichy assault rifles (TAR) were dispatched to various security forces including the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). OFT celebrated its ordnance factory day on Thursday. OFT sources that the financial year was very productive with the launch of an exclusive assembly line for producing an indigenous weapon named stabilized remote controlled gun (SRCG). SRCG, which is designed for marine applications, will be mounted on warships and patrol boats, and can be controlled without human intervention. The factory has also dispatched 72 air defence gun during the corresponding period for the armoured fighting vehicles of defence forces. A new weapon, an under-barrel grenade launcher (UBGL) for AK-47/TAR was also launched by OFT. Lt Col Karthikesh Kasinath, security officer attached to the OFT was felicitated for being conferred as the best security officer (Ayudh Award) by the ordnance factories headquarters.

---||Lucknow||All jail inmates in UP to get jab, drive to begin next week||LUCKNOW: With coronavirus cases rising steadily, UP government would launch a special drive to vaccinate all inmates lodged in the state prisons. Sources said that while a decision to this effect has been taken, the standard operating procedure for the same is being drafted. There are 1.16 lakh inmates lodged across 74 jails, including central jails, in UP. “Jail inmates belong to the vulnerable group of Covid-19 infection. That’s mainly because they live close to each other in barracks and following social distancing at times is not possible,” said a health department officer on Thursday. In fact, he further said, many of them had taken ill because of the pandemic virus last year. In fact on Thursday, ten jail inmates in Kanpur tested positive to the pandemic infection. However, this is not the first incident. In January, 117 inmates and several jail officials in Basti tested positive. Similar incidents were reported in Siddharthnagar, Agra and Jhansi as well. Last year during the lockdown inmates were sent home, but doing the same every time is not possible as it is not certain how long the pandemic will stay. Talking about the SOP, sources said: “Local administration will moderate and hold vaccination camps on the jail premises. Ambulance network will be kept ready for transportation and management of inmates in case of any adverse event following immunisation. However, so far, less than 1% of people have reported side effects and no serious event has been recorded.” They also said that the data of inmates is already available with the state home department and also with district authorities. Going by the numbers, all inmates may be covered in two days. Once everything falls in place, the vaccine drive may take place on Tuesday and Wednesday next week. Experts noted that cases in jails always come in bulk and isolation of suspected and positive patients is a tough task. “Even a single positive case means launching a mammoth exercise to trace all possible contacts which may mean testing everyone in the jail. Therefore, vaccinating them is a logical idea,” said an officer of the state home department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/all-jail-inmates-in-up-to-get-jab-drive-to-begin-next-week/articleshow/81578685.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The capacity of the CCC will be 500 beds and will be operational within the next two to three days. The civic body had opened nine CCCs in the city, including in the hostel building, during the Covid outbreak. There had been a spike in cases in September 2020, when the city was recording 864 cases per day on an average. Followed by a drop in cases added per day in the next coming months. After the drop in cases, NMC had closed all nine CCCs in phases by December end. NMC had made operational its two covid hospitals- Bytco and Zakir Hussain hospital in the city. The city had reported only 99 cases per day on an average in the first week of February, but the cases started increasing from the second week. Between March 1 and 7, the city had reported around 262 cases per day on average, but the cases tripled to around 714 cases in the second week of March.  The city has recorded 950 cases per day on an average during the last four days between March 14 and 17. “As there has been a rise in new cases, we are opening the CCC at the building of the social welfare department in the next two to three days,” said NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-restart-ccc-at-hostel-building/articleshow/81574798.cms||Tushar Pawar

Like Delhi, other state governments can also utilise the technology and make it available free of cost to farmers, said Rai. “A delegation of senior officials from Haryana and Punjab has come to Delhi to understand the impact of the bio de-composer developed by the Pusa Institute to solve the problem of stubble burning. In a meeting, we informed the delegation about its effects,” said the minister. Rai also stressed the need for a centralised system for bio-composting and the need to set up a centre for the same in every district. “All the states will have to make concerted efforts to solve the problem of stubble burning,” he said. Before the meeting, the delegation interacted with farmers from Hiranki, Palla and Jindpur villages, and scientists from the Pusa Institute. Farmers told the delegation that spraying of the solution had so far been effective and it also reduced their fertiliser usage. “Farmers informed them that the fertility of their field has also improved,” said an official. Rai further said both short-term and long-term policies would be required to eliminate stubble burning. “Scientists from the Pusa Institute and officials of Delhi, Haryana and Punjab should work on this by forming a joint team,” he suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rai-calls-for-efforts-to-tackle-farm-fires/articleshow/81595418.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Cabral on safe ground, but BJP a divided house in Curchorem Cacora||MARGAO: With less than a year to go for the 2022 assembly elections, Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral will be looking forward to retaining his sway over the Curchorem Cacora Municipal Council (CCMC) by scoring a victory in the March 20 civic polls. With 12 of the 14 councillors who had won the last civic polls having pledged their allegiance to him, Cabral had virtually kept the CCMC under his thumb the entire term. Though neither the Congress nor any other political outfit yet to put up a semblance of a challenge for Cabral for the 2022 assembly polls, political observers are keeping a close watch on whether any anti-incumbency factor against Cabral plays out in the CCMC polls. Cabral has been representing Curchorem constituency in the state legislative assembly since 2012. Over CCMC’s last term, frequent change of guard in the municipality had led to development of the town taking a backseat, with the municipality failing to take any major public utility project or initiative to fruition. Frequent transfers of some efficient chief officers affected the administrative functioning and service-delivery mechanism of the CCMC. The proposal of construction of a commercial complex by demolishing the existing dilapidated municipal market building that was initiated by the CCMC several years back is yet to make any headway, leading to disenchantment among the local traders. Besides, several other proposed projects, including fish-and-vegetable market complex and the municipality’s administrative building, work on which had started years ago, are yet to be completed. For the cash-strapped CCMC, the new projects were expected to generate enough revenue for the civic body to make it self-sustainable. Nevertheless, signs of change are perceptible in the civic polls this time with several new faces and many women candidates throwing their hat in the ring. Of the altogether 48 candidates in the fray, 18 are women - 13 among them from five wards reserved for women. Following the delimitation exercise, the CCMC wards have gone up to 15. A close contest is on the cards in several wards. Former chairperson Jasmine Braganza, a long-time Cabral-supporter, is taking on new entrant Siddhesh Bhise in ward 5. In a four-cornered contest, former councillors Guna Naik and Maruti Naik are pitted against new faces Pramod Naik and Nandesh Vasta in ward 1. In ward 2, Cabral-supported former chairperson Felix Fernandes is in a direct contest against Prasanna Bhende, while a five-cornered fight is being played out in ward 4 where former councillor Abhay Khandekar is seeking a comeback after a decade-long hiatus from civic politics. Interestingly, as most of the candidates contesting against each other in key wards are BJP supporters, clearly, the saffron party is going to the Curchorem Cacora civic polls as a house divided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabral-on-safe-ground-but-bjp-a-divided-house-in-curchorem-cacora/articleshow/81577627.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

---||Delhi||Delhi: How 3 key transport hubs will be made future-ready||NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority has modified its Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) policy keeping in view future growth of the capital and introduction of modes of transport apart from the urban metro train such as RRTS, Metro Lite and Metro-Neo. DDA has identified Anand Vihar, Sarai Kale Khan and Kashmere Gate as key locations among the 12 ‘transit nodes’ to be developed as multi-modal transport hubs under the revised policy. The modification in the TOD policy was given final approval by DDA in its meeting held under the chairmanship of lieutenant governor Anil Baijal. TOD consists of a variety of high-density, mixed-use, mixed-income buildings within a short distance of a mass transit systems centre that facilitates people walking, cycling or using public transport rather than personal transport. Initially created with primarily Delhi Metro and the railway stations in mind, the revised TOD policy will also enable node-based TOD around upcoming modes of public transit, making the policy ‘future ready’. The revised TOD policy will allow mass public transit agencies to utilise their operational area like tracks, stations, depots, etc., for development, facilitating the use of more effective and sustainable operation and maintenance models for the transit agencies. In the first phase, 12 transit nodes have been identified for development as TOD hubs, which, apart from the Multi-Modal Transit Hubs at Kashmere Gate, Anand Vihar and Sarai Kale Khan, include the metro stations at Haiderpur Badli Mor, Rohini Sector 18, Mukundpur, Dwarka Sector 21, Trilokpuri, Karkardooma (both Pink and Blue Line stations) and the stations on the corridor between Dwarka Sector 8 and Sector 14. The other transit nodes selected for TOD in the first phase are New Delhi Railway Station and the Jangpura station of the upcoming Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System. The well-integrated multi-modal transit hubs will ensure seamless integration between various transport services, providing concourse level integration under one single roof, wherever feasible. The modified TOD policy will be now forwarded to the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs for its approval and final notification. DDA said the revised policy can potentially improve public transit ridership, reduce vehicular congestion, greenhouse emissions and pollution in the long run. The compact development under TOD Policy ensures ample provision of open and green spaces, up to 30% of the total area with at least 20% as public green space, promoting walkable precincts in the TOD nodes. Additional development control norms regarding active frontage, parking, and other building controls have been added for creating more vibrant public spaces that not only promotes walking, non-motorised transport and public transport as efficient modes of transport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-3-key-transport-hubs-will-be-made-future-ready/articleshow/81576647.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Agra||National Human Rights Commission seeks report from UP on death of five persons in septic tank in Agra||AGRA: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Thursday issued notice to the UP government and to the state police seeking reply within four weeks on the death of five persons in an open septic tank in Agra. Taking suo motu cognizance of the tragedy, the rights body said that responsibility should be fixed in the apparent case of gross negligence. NHRC issued notices to the chief secretary and director general of police, UP, asking for a detailed report mentioning measures being taken by the state government to avert such tragedy in the future. The commission has observed that five lives were lost due to the apparent negligence of the owner of the house as well as the authorities responsible for monitoring such work in their area of jurisdiction. Four from a family and a neighbour were killed on Tuesday after inhaling poisonous gas inside a septic tank in Agra’s Fatehabad area. The string of deaths began when a 10-year-old boy accidently fell into an under-construction septic tank which was filled with filth flowing from another tank nearby in Pratapura. According to villagers, the tank was dug three days ago and was not covered. “It is necessary to fix the responsibility and take action against the guilty so that such incidents of gross negligence are not repeated,” read the NHRC statement. District magistrate Prabhu N Singh has said, “The post-mortem report has said that the five persons died due to suffocation caused by the poisonous gas inside the septic tank. A detailed report has been sought from the sub divisional magistrate Fatehabad in the entire matter.” “State government has announced a compensation of Rs 2lakh to the kin of each deceased. Farmer Sonu Sharma was among the four deceased members of the family. His family will be provided Rs 5 lakh compensation under the Mukhyamantri Krishak Durghatna Kalyan Yojana. Required actions will be taken to ensure such an incident does not repeat in future,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/nhrc-seeks-report-from-up-on-death-of-five-persons-in-septic-tank-in-agra/articleshow/81575514.cms||Deepak Lavania

The TRS government has projected a total outlay of over Rs 2.30 lakh crore while it has actual revenues of less than Rs 1.20 lakh crore,” he said. Shabbir Ali alleged that the budget statistics indicate that the TRS government plans to burden the common man with Rs 30,225 crore in 2021-22 with new taxes or other means. “No state can progress by pushing its people into huge debt. Telangana is already spending nearly Rs 10,000 crore towards payment of instalments and interest on loans,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/budget-far-from-reality-cong/articleshow/81577619.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Bhopal||A year on, Bhopal’s first Covid-19 patient says patience is key to deal with a situation||Bhopal: “No matter what, the best way to deal with any situation is to be patient,” said the first person to be diagnosed with Covid-19 in Bhopal. A year on, “the universe is trying to make it up to me” said the 27-year-old. The infection now long gone, the person’s accomplishments since March 2020 include – merit distinction in Master of Law (Queen Mary University of London) and achieving a rare feat of being a member of both – Europe’s Visual Contract community and US- based Legal Design Alliance. In March last year, when the whole world was glued to the Covid-19 spread, all that this person was concerned about was upcoming exams and other related paper submissions. After 15 days of hospitalisation at AIIMS, studies took prominence. In sharp contrast, the world made unsolicited use of her Facebook and social media accounts. “Everything was in rush. People had a knee-jerk reaction to everything around Covid-19. I am a major in media law. Impatient and thoughtful reactions, lack of sensitivity, rumours all added to an uncalled for fear about the infection,” the recovered patient said. The only person directly to be infected in her close contact was her father. “I was told not to speak out,” the person said, who has seldom posted and given interviews on fighting and recovering from Covid-19. “I still get responses over my videos and write-ups pertaining to my Covid-19 experience. It has inspired a few,” the person said. The person does not forget to mention a directive by the Supreme Court of India to protect the privacy of Covid-19 patients. Jabalpur’s Golbazaar relives containment days The chief medical health officer (CMHO) of Jabalpur confirmed four cases of the novel coronavirus in the city on March 20, 2020. Three of the cases were members of a businessman’s family with an international travel history. Residents of Golbazaar area were the first to witness a containment zone in the state. Even today, residents of the area still get scared remembering that time. Golbazaar area is a residential area as per the master plan, but it has been converted into a commercial area due to its proximity to the main market. People have started doing business by opening shops in their homes. After four coronavirus patients were diagnosed in the area, the district administration declared the Golbazaar to be the first containment zone. Over time, commercial activity in the area has returned to a semblance of normalcy. A neighbour said that he had been following the instructions of wearing mask and maintaining social distancing since then. A local businessman from the locality said that containment was something new for them. “All we knew was that we had to take precautions and follow strict instructions under the lockdown. “ Another neighbour said that the day when his locality Golbazaar was declared as containment area and became the first to be declared in Madhya Pradesh. “Contact tracing information was also being collected on those who came in contact with the infected. We were in self-isolation. Did not meet anyone and a sense of terror prevailed even in touching things that were outside the perimeter of the house,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/a-year-on-bhopals-first-covid-19-patient-says-patience-is-key-to-deal-with-a-situation/articleshow/81575512.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||March against felling of trees for Metro line||New Delhi: After Delhi was declared as the most polluted capital city in the world in a recent report, people, including children, took out a march on Friday demanding protection of trees. They protested against Delhi Metro’s Phase-IV plan, which would lead to felling of over 10,000 trees. The march was organised under the aegis of Fridays for Future, which is a global initiative for conservation of environment. In an RTI reply dated February 7, 2020, DMRC had identified 10,438 trees for felling as part of its expansion work for three corridors. Ridge Management Board, which had recently conducted a meeting, deferred the matter related to expansion of Metro line passing through ridge areas. The protesters in their memorandum to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said, “The government should not allow this massive felling of trees or claim transplantation as a solution.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/march-against-felling-of-trees-for-metro-line/articleshow/81595444.cms||---
---||Lucknow||BJP netas to dine with Dalits in party’s mass outreach blitz in UP||LUCKNOW: While positioning itself to launch a slew of mass outreach programmes from Friday to commemorate four years of BJP rule in Uttar Pradesh, the saffron party chalked out a strategy to galvanise Dalits by dining with them in run-up to panchayat elections. Party sources said, the blueprint of the campaign has been hammered out by the party brass at the recently held state executive meet. Recently, state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh took the lead by breaking bread with a Dalit booth-level functionary after holding a gram chaupal at a village in Sultanpur. “The issue of ‘samajik samrasta’ (social harmony) was discussed threadbare at the state executive meet and it was decided that attempts by the Opposition to split Hindus on caste lines need to be foiled. For this, the party should associate itself with communities of all hues, including Dalits,” a senior BJP functionary told TOI, confirming the party’s plan to hold community lunch with backward and oppressed sections. This comes close on heels of the party’s decision to consolidate its position at the grassroots by organising programmes, showcasing achievements of BJP from Friday, when the Yogi Adityanath government completes four years in the state. The party has planned a grand function in Lucknow, which would be attended by all senior party functionaries. On Saturday, the party will hold events at all 403 assembly seats to highlight work done in respective constituencies. The programmes, which would be attended by BJP MLAs, MPs and MLCs, will also be shared with people through the audio-visual platform. The party would subsequently make a bid to reach out to farmers in 826 blocks, which comes amid prolonged protests by farmers, particularly in west UP, against new farm laws. Sources said, the party has already asked members of its Kisan Morcha to fan out across the state and hold discussions with farmers, apprising them about steps taken by the state government for welfare of farmers, including stepping up procurement of food grains and initiating steps to double their income. The party will move into micro campaign mode on March 22 when it will reach out to youth in all 3,051 wards of zila panchayats. This will be followed by programmes to consolidate its position amongst women on March 23 and then amongst street vendors on March 24. The party functionaries would then conduct door-to-door campaigning on March 25 and March 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-netas-to-dine-with-dalits-in-partys-mass-outreach-blitz/articleshow/81578688.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Woman among 3 in police custody in data theft case||PUNE: A magisterial court here on Thursday remanded two proprietors of a now defunct Aurangabad-based Marathi news channel and a woman MBA (finance) graduate in police custody till March 20 in connection with the alleged theft of pan-India sensitive data of corporate account holders in private banks and trading the information with buyers with an intent to siphon off funds. On Wednesday, the city cybercrime police arrested channel proprietors Rajesh Sharma (42) and Paramjitsingh Sandhu (40) and Sinhagad Road resident Anagha Modak (40), who is into share trading. She wanted to buy the stolen data for making quick money. Sharma and Sandhu, too, have been held for the same purpose. The police had on Monday arrested eight persons, including five software engineers and a film producer. Four of the arrested techies were working with the banks’ data management centres. The police are checking if they stole the data from these centres or banks. DCP (cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake told TOI on Thursday, “We have written letters to two private banks and the corporate firms that held these accounts. . We want to know from the banks how the data was compromised.” Another police officer said, “We are searching for a person in Hyderabad and another in Surat. There were primarily two groups in the two cities involved in the case. Vishal Bendre (45), a realtor from Aurangabad, had brought them together. We are probing how Bendre came in contact with them.”  Apart from Bendre, Modak, Sandhu, and Sharma, the other arrested suspects are Ravindra Mashalkar (34) of Latur, Mukesh More (37) of Yerawada, Rajshekhar Mamidi (34) of Hyderabad, film producer Rohan Ravindra Mankani (37) of Sahakarnagar, Atmaram Kadam (34) of Mulund, Varun Verma (37) of Uttar Pradesh and Vikas Yadav (25) of Surat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-among-3-in-police-custody-in-data-theft-case/articleshow/81576652.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Covid cases rise in Secunderabad, officals warn lax public||SECUNDERABAD: Danger bells of Covid-19 pandemic are ringing in Secunderabad Cantonment. Secunderabad Cantonment officials, who are in worry about spreading of Covid-19, have geared up arrangements for sanitisation in the jurisdiction. The reason is, officials have observed a spike of nearly 50 new Covid-19 cases, which have been reported within the span of just a couple of weeks. According to official figures, a total of 30 fresh positive cases were reported — 15 each at Bowenpally area and at Rasoolpura, followed by Picket, which reported a total of 12 new positive cases. In Trimulgherry areas, till now, a total of five cases and in Bollarum, three positive cases were reported. “Recently, we sanitised a residential colony in Vasavi Nagar of Kakaguda situated in Tirumalagiri, after three Covid-19 cases reported,” SCB senior superintendent (SWM), M Devender said. “We have alerted district medical and health staff and taken feedback on the surge in new cases in the Cantonment. According to them, cases are rising in Picket and Rasoolpura, where slums and other areas have thick populations,” he said. When TOI contacted Deputy CEO, Secunderabad Cantonment, Vijaykumar Balan Nair, he said, “It is true that positive cases are being reported in the Cantonment and decision on earmarking of containments has not been taken. It depends on the state government’s decision.” “Total negligence of the general public in following Covid-19 norms like wearing of masks, maintaining social distance in public areas like vegetable markets, shopping malls, bar & restaurants, malls selling groceries and vegetables, reopening of movie theatres, and people travelling from one place to other places across the states and outside, could be reasons for rising Covid-19 cases in the Cantonment,” a senior medical and health official said. In fact, people relaxed after Covid-19 cases suddenly dipped for the past few months and forget to follow Covid-19 norms strictly, she added. “Most residents who are affected with positive symptoms have failed to stay in home isolation and are roaming in public places, which is one of the reasons for increasing cases,” said a doctor from a government dispensary in Cantonment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-cases-rise-in-secbad-officals-warn-lax-public/articleshow/81577618.cms||Sunil Mungara

On Wednesday, municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav issued an order about slapping a fine of Rs 200 on each individual found without a mask. Moreover, police cases will be lodged against and their swabs samples will be collected for Covid-19 testing.

Of the 287 errant citizens, the civic body collected the throat swab samples of 88. Two of the samples tested positive for Covid-19. “These people, moving about without masks, are causing the spread of the virus. Had the action not been taken, the two citizens who have tested positive for Covid, would have infected many others,” said Jadhav adding that directives have been given to all the six divisional officers and other officials to take action against errant citizens. Bapsaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of NMC, said the current strain of the virus spreading in the city was more infectious, though not fatal. “Therefore, citizens should take all the precautionary measures like wearing masks, maintaining physical distance and using hand sanitizers to prevent the spread of Covid-19,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/wear-mask-or-be-ready-for-covid-test-nashik-civic-chief/articleshow/81574809.cms||Tushar Pawar

Over 500 contract workers, who are also frontline Covid workers, have been staging ‘dera agitation’ in front of the collectorate for the last 37 days demanding payment of their pending salaries of seven months and implementation of minimum wages Act. As the GMCH administration ignored their demand, contract workers agitating under the banner of Jan Vikas Kamgar Sangh had filed a complaint with the SHRC on March 9. President of the workers union Pappu alias Pradeep Deshmukh told TOI that both GMCH dean and the labour commissioner have been directed to be present before the SHRC in Mumbai on April 15 to clarify their stand. Deepak Chatap, who is representing the protesters, too has been asked to be present for the hearing.

---||Pune||1 held, minor detained for snatching mobiles||Pune: The police have arrested a man and detained his minor accomplice for molesting women and snatching their smartphones. The police claimed to have solved at least three such cases and recovered four cellphones from the duo. Senior inspector Vivek Mugalikar of Wakad police station said, “The duo would outrage the modesty of their victims before snatching their smartphones. We tracked them after checking CCTV footage from over 100 spots. Of the three robberies detected, two happened on March 7 and the third on March 12. We are yet to trace the owner of the fourth smartphone recovered from the arrested man Mukuldev Singh (23), a resident of Dehu Road.” He said two of the three women had lodged an FIR only of smart phone snatching as they feared mentioning the duo’s inappropriate behaviour. “A 35-year-old woman cyclist on March 7, filed a complaint stating that two men on a scooter outraged her modesty around 8am when she had taken a break while cycling and snatched her smartphone, worth Rs 9,000,” Mugalikar said. A police team, comprising assistant inspectors Santosh Patil and Abhijit Jadhav, swung into action and checked the CCTV footage. “We received the information that the duo was on the service road of Katraj-Dehu Road bypass. We laid a trap and took them into custody,” Mugalikar said. During questioning, the accused admitted that on March 7 they had molested a 22-year-old while she was on a morning walk at around 5.45am at Kaspate Vasti in Wakad and snatched her smartphone worth Rs 10,000. Five days later, they had struck in the evening at Thergaon. By using the same modus, they snatched the smartphone of a 19-year-old employee of a private company, who was waiting for her bus, the officer said. Mugalikar said, “We have recovered smartphones worth Rs 50,000 from them before they could sell them off. They do not have any previous criminal record. The 16-year-old suspect is a school dropout.” Last week, the police had arrested a Dehu Road resident and a minor boy for snatching cellphones in Wakad and Nigdi over a period of four weeks. On Friday, a police team spotted the duo on a moped in Tathawade area. They were detained and, upon interrogation, they said that they were in the area to snatch cellphones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1-held-minor-detained-for-snatching-mobiles/articleshow/81576665.cms||Mihir Tanksale

After a preliminary inquiry, Sarthana police had closed the case saying that the nature of the complaint was civil in nature and not criminal. In its order, the senior civil judge observed that the preliminary inquiry should have been completed in seven days of receiving the complaint and the parameter of a preliminary inquiry should be to decide if a cognizable offence can be registered or not. “In this case, the dispute is between two business associates and police initially found that it is a financial matter hence an offence was not registered. It seems the fault on part of the police is the inquiry was not completed within seven days.

---||Delhi||Two workers held for spitting on dough at eatery in Delhi, cops probe if act deliberate||NEW DELHI: After such cases in Meerut and Ghaziabad, two men working in a restaurant in Khyala in west Delhi have been arrested for the reprehensible act of spitting on the dough while preparing naan. This act of the two natives of Kishanganj in Bihar went viral on social media, alerting the cops. While the men claimed to use spittle to make the naan stick to the tandoor, police are probing allegations that this was in fact a malicious and deliberate act. The restaurant has also been booked for operating without a licence. According to police, they received information about the incident when people tagged the Twitter handle of @DCPWestDelhi and other officers, complaining about the unhygienic and unacceptable act of spitting on the dough in the process of making rotis and naan. An image and a video of the act were also brought to their notice. “Personnel at Khyala police station were asked to identify the food outlet shown on the viral video. They discovered it was Hotel Chand, located in N Block of Vishnu Garden. The hotel is run by one Aamir," said Urvija Goel, DCP (West). The two workers seen in the viral video have been identified as Sabi Anwer, in a blue T-shirt, and Ibrahim. Police registered an FIR against them under sections 269 and 270 of the Indian Penal Code pertaining to negligent and malignant acts likely to spread infection or disease dangerous to life. Section 272 (adulteration of food) and Section 273 (selling noxious food) have also been invoked. Aamir has also been booked under the Delhi Police Act for running an eatery without permission. In the wake of the incident, police have cautioned restaurants and dhabas to ensure cleanliness and prevent practices like these. Last month, a man was arrested in Meerut after being caught on camera spitting on the dough while preparing rotis at a wedding function. The accused was identified as Naushad. Last week, a 22-year-old Mohammad Mohsin was arrested in Ghaziabad after a video went viral showing him spitting on the roti dough. Mohsin had been engaged by a caterer for an engagement ceremony in Bhojpur, police said. These incidents caused an uproar on social media with users calling for a closer monitoring of eateries and their practices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-workers-held-for-spitting-on-dough-at-eatery-cops-probe-if-act-deliberate/articleshow/81576670.cms||---

The bus was going from Gurgaon to West Bengal. Passengers claimed that the driver was drunk and even locked his cabin door from inside when they complained. The accident took place around 1:30 am. Khandauli station house officer Arvind Kumar, who was patrolling the stretch, immediately reached the accident spot He took the injured passengers out of the bus and shifted them to hospital. He told TOI that around 90-100 passengers were present inside the bus at the time of the accident. Mohammad Salaluddin, who was travelling from Gurgaon to Malda on the bus, told TOI that the driver was drinking while he was at the wheel and when they raised objections, he locked his cabin from inside. Salaluddin, who works as a sanitation worker in a society in Gurgaon, said four persons were sitting on a sleeper berth meant for a single passenger. Transport officials said that usually in overloaded buses, the driver and the conductor charge less fare from passengers, mostly labourers, and accommodate several of them on just one berth. Yamuna Expressway corridor control incharge (Agra-Mathura sector) Major (retd) Manish Kumar Singh said that he lodged a police complaint against the driver for putting the passengers' lives at risk. The driver of the bus with UP registration number ran away from the accident spot. An FIR was registered against the driver under sections 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt by an act which endangers human life) and 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of IPC at Khandauli police station. When contacted, deputy transport commissioner, Agra, Jai Shankar Tiwari, said, a sleeper coach bus has a capacity of 42-44 persons. “I was told that the driver was drunk and the bus was overloaded,” he said, adding that he will write to the authorities concerned to cancel the permit of the bus. This stretch of Yamuna Expressway has witnessed several accidents, including the one in 2019, when 29 people died and 23 others were injured after a UP state transport bus travelling from Lucknow fell into a canal. In December 2020, five members of a Lucknow family were charred to death inside their car when it burst into flames after colliding with a truck on the same stretch||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/overloaded-bus-with-90-onboard-and-drunk-driver-overturns-on-yamuna-e-way-16-hurt-3-critical/articleshow/81575525.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The violators will be issued online challans on the basis of evidence collected. Talking with TOI, incharge, Yamuna Expressway corridor control (Agra-Mathura sector), Major Manish Singh (Retd), said it is a common practice for private and government buses drivers to park their vehicle at undesignated spots either for a halt to get refreshment from unauthorized roadside dhabas or to drop passengers mid-way. This usually causes accidents on the expressway, where roadside parking is not allowed, he added. Sharing the accident figures on the 100-km stretch of Yamuna Expressway from Agra to Mathura, Singh said, last year, 264 accidents took place only on this stretch. Of these, 366 accident victims sustained minor injuries, 177 were critically injured while 69 people died. “We had started collecting information, earlier this month, and will provide all evidence along with pictures of erring drivers to the transport department for issuing an online challan to them,” Singh added. Acting on their initiative, Agra regional transport officer (RTO), enforcement, Anil Kumar, has assigned duties to officials to ensure issuing of challans for “no parking” under the Motor Vehicle Act on the basis of information provided by Yamuna Expressway authority on parking vehicles at unauthorized spots. Rajesh Mohan, a public transport officer who has been assigned this task, said online challans are being issued to violators and “no parking” fine of Rs 500 is being charged. Almost 100 challans are issued every day in Agra and Mathura, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/drive-launched-to-collect-e-challan-for-unauthorized-parking-on-yamuna-e-way/articleshow/81575534.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Delhi||Twin DDA moves: Dynamic parking norms, Yamuna mgmt committee||New Delhi: The Delhi Development Authority’s meeting chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Thursday saw a slew of important proposals being approved, including a ‘Policy for dynamic parking norms for Delhi’ and the constitution of ‘River Yamuna Management Committee’.The parking norms of Delhi have been rationalised and revised to cater to the current and future requirements, DDA said in a statement. Currently, parking norms in Delhi are based on the designated use of the premise, which sometimes leads to vehicles from buildings spilling over, encroaching and congesting public spaces.The dynamic parking norms aim to provide a balance of parking provisions, which would include norms based on the number and size of the dwelling units in case of residential projects instead of the built-up area or carpet area. In case of banquet halls, parking norms have been tweaked in accordance with the orders of the National Green Tribunal. The enhanced norms are aimed at ensuring that there is adequate parking space inside such venues so that parked vehicles don’t cause congestion or block right of way.In case of government-run hospitals and government offices, parking norms have been aligned with the actual usage keeping in mind the end users. The rationalisation has also been done taking into account the usage of Delhi Metro and presence of multi-level car parking in an area.The norms will now be put in public domain for 45 days for inviting objections and suggestions. The authority on Thursday also approved the constitution of ‘River Yamuna Management Committee’ for monitoring of the Yamuna and its floodplain to ensure their conservation, protection and rejuvenation as per the NGT orders.The committee will be headed by the Delhi LG and members include Delhi chief secretary, DDA vice-chairman, representative of Ministry of Jal Shakti and other stakeholder departments from governments of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, apart from technical experts. The committee will coordinate with all the stakeholders so that restoration work is carried out smoothly.To create vibrant, sustainable and inclusive affordable rental housing avenues for urban migrants and urban poor, the authority has given preliminary approval for inclusion of Affordable Rental Housing Complex scheme in the Master Plan for Delhi-2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/twin-dda-moves-dynamic-parking-norms-yamuna-mgmt-committee/articleshow/81576697.cms||---

Her younger son secretly recorded a video of his elder brother spitting on their mother and informed the police, following which the accused was arrested. A senior police officer said the younger son approached them on Tuesday about his brother Anil Pande (65) torturing their mother. “The younger son provided the video clip of the harassment. The younger son said that his mother was the owner of the property where they resided,” the policeman added. In his complaint, the man told the police officers that his mother was very weak and paralytic, and could not speak or stand without any help. “We registered a case under Persons with Disabilities Act and Pande was arrested,” said a senior police officer. Last week, a 76-year-old woman had died after her son allegedly slapped her outside their house in southwest Delhi’s Dwarka on Monday. As per the police, the woman and her son had an argument over her picking fights with their neighbours over parking, during which the son attacked her. He was later arrested by the cops.

---||Goa||Ramanamurthy takes over as SEC, to review poll conduct in Goa||PANAJI: W V Ramanamurthy, former secretary of the water resources department and managing director of the Economic Development Corporation, took charge as the new state election commissioner (SEC) on Thursday. The appointment order was issued by the directorate of panchayats. Soon after taking charge, the new SEC told reporters that he would hold a review meeting on the conduct of the civic elections and that details would be issued shortly. When asked about when the polls to five municipalities — Margao, Mapusa, Mormugao, Quepem and Sanguem — would be announced, he said, “I am new. I have to study the matter.” Ramanamurthy served in the state administration for many years as an officer of the Goa Civil Service before he was elevated to the Indian Administrative Service cadre a decade ago. He succeeds law secretary Choka Ram Garg as the SEC after the Supreme Court passed strictures against the state government for giving charge of the election body to a serving bureaucrat. Although the state government had selected former joint chief electoral officer Narayan Navti as the SEC, he refused to take up the job as he did not fit the criterion of having served for 20 years in the Goa Civil Service cadre. On March 12, a Supreme Court bench of Justices R F Nariman, B R Gavai and Hrishikesh Roy rapped the Goa government for giving additional charge of the SEC to its law secretary. It said the decision “made a mockery of the Constitutional mandate that state ECs must be truly independent bodies”. The Supreme Court also upheld the verdict of the Bombay high court’s Goa bench that reservation to wards in five municipal councils were not as per the Constitution and that the state should rework the quotas and then conduct the polls. The apex court has set April 30 as the deadline for completion of the entire election process to these five municipal councils.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ramanamurthy-takes-over-as-sec-to-review-poll-conduct/articleshow/81577643.cms||---

One of the vehicles, a Prado, is registered in the name of Vijaykumar Ganpat Bhosle, a Shiv Sena functionary from Ratnagiri, officials said. The other vehicle is a Mercedes Benz. Three days ago, the police had seized a Mercedes being used by Waze. The state Anti-Terrorism Squad, which is probing the murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, who had possession of the Scorpio, will seek Waze’s custody during hearing of his anticipatory bail application in Thane sessions court on Friday. Meanwhile, the NIA and ATS probe based on CCTV images has revealed that on February 17, Hiran and Waze had a 10-minute conversation in the Mercedes near GPO at Fort. Hiran had travelled to South Mumbai in an Ola cab, claiming his Scorpio had developed a snag on Mulund-Airoli Road. The CCTV footage showed Waze leaving Mumbai police headquarters, where his office was located, in his Mercedes. His vehicle was again spotted outside CSMT at the main traffic signal. The signal was green, but the Mercedes didn’t move further, and Waze had switched on the parking light. After a few seconds, the camera showed Hiran crossing the road and getting into the Mercedes. The cameras spotted the Mercedes again opposite GPO, parked by the roadside. It was parked there for over 10 minutes, after which Hiran got down. The Mercedes was then seen entering the police headquarters. The driver of the Ola used by Hiran to travel to CSMT told ATS officials Hiran received five calls during the trip. Waze, who is believed to have made these calls, had asked Hiran to meet him outside Roopam showroom opposite the police headquarters, but during the last call, changed the spot to CSMT, sources said. The agencies have contacted L&T for maintenance and preservation of these images. The owner of the Mercedes seized , Suresh Bhavsar, has said he sold the vehicle in February to a car trading site.

---||Kolkata||CNI help for Cov lockdown victims||Kolkata: The Diocese of Kolkata under the Church of North India (CNI) started a project, which saw some of the poorest residents of different parishes start their new businesses, on Thursday. They are the ones who have no income and are somehow surviving on alms. The project has been christened as ‘The Neighbour’ by Bishop Paritosh Canning, head of the CNI in Kolkata and its aim is to help the poor people re-start their life and the churches under the diocese are trying to support them from all religious backgrounds. Most of the beneficiaries in the first phase of the project are non-Christians. From daily labourers, who have lost jobs in the pandemic, to widows, who work as domestic helps and are still unable to meet the expenses of their children, various people have come under the fold of the project. “The church has to play a diverse role and should not be restricted within the precincts of religion only. It is through ther service to humanity that we should aim to reach God since that is the need of the hour,” said Bishop Canning. Out of the 200 people, who have been identified by the 31 member churches of the diocese, 175 are from other religions. The churches were asked to identify those in need of immediate help. The idea was not to give them donations because that would not hold out for long, but to set up small businesses that they can run to plough back the money, which the church gives them as seed. While some got cycle vans, some got kiosks for small food business and some got sewing machines and accessories for tailoring units, some got electronic weighing machines to sell vegetables and fruits. Each got benefits between Rs 10,000 and Rs 20,000 to set up their business. Since they are novices, they will be helped in running their business too. The church is also opening bank accounts for these people. Take the case of Asha Dutta, a widow, who has an ailing mother of two school-going children. “With the paltry amount I earn as a domestic help, I was unable to bear the expense of my kids’ education. Now, I will start a business I will now be setting up a business of selling spices and the church is helping me with not only the supplies but also with the contacts,” said Dutta, a resident of Free School Street. Mohammed Akhtar had suffered severe losses and shut down his fruit business on S N Banerjee Road. “I have been given a cycle van along with an assurance of daily fruit supplies that I will sell daily,” he said. “This will be an ongoing project and we will be trying to bring in more people in phases. We will take stock of how much we have been able to accomplish after a year,” said Father Pradip Nanda, presbyter of St John’s Church and Union Chapel, who is co-ordinating the project for the diocese. “We have sourced funds for the project and if we are successful, we shall surely raise more funds to help more people,” said Ritesh Sarkar, finance secretary of the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cni-help-for-cov-lockdown-victims/articleshow/81576765.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI that a letter has been written by the government that Singh be given an extension of six months. Delhi government and the central government have equal stake in the DMRC, and its managing director is always designated by the state government with concurrence of the Centre. Once the Centre gives its concurrence to the Delhi government’s proposal, this would be the third extension for Singh who has been a part of Delhi Metro since the very beginning. Singh is DMRC’s second managing director and he took over from E Sreedharan on December 31, 2011. Singh got his first extension in December 2016 and the second one for three and a half months on December 15, 2020, which comes to an end on March 31, 2021. Sources said that the process of selecting Singh’s successor is going to begin soon. Singh oversaw Delhi Metro’s Phase-III expansion, when the network length doubled compared with the combined network built during Phase-I and Phase-II projects. Work on the Phase-IV project started in 2019-end and received a jolt due to the Covid-19 pandemic but has gained pace in the last few months. Singh cleared the elite Indian Railways Services of Engineers (IRSE) examination in 1981 and has been with the Indian Railways in various capacities, including deputy chief engineer, Kolkata Metro Railway (1989-1996). He joined DMRC in 1997 as chief project manager and moved upwards to executive director and then director (works).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/extend-tenure-of-dmrc-chief-till-sept-delhi-govt-to-centre/articleshow/81595481.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Chandigarh||CM says 112 Punjab farmers died during protests, farm bodies seek relief||BATHINDA: While Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday claimed that 112 farmers belonging to Punjab died during the protests against the farm laws enacted by the Centre, farm organisations claimed that in all, 302 farmers from various states died in the protests since November 24, 2020 and most of them were from Punjab. According to data compiled by Kisan Ekta Morcha, the official social media account of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, 302 farmers died during the protests since November 24. Of these, 12 farmers died before November 24 but after the protests started in Punjab on October 1. The data has been compiled in a blog named, “”Human cost of farmer protest.” Kisan morcha members also announced financial compensation to all bereaved families of farmers. So far, compensation has been provided by various farmer organisations in some of the cases. Kisan morcha members claimed that of the total of 302 fatalities, more than 200 were from Punjab. However, state-wise data is yet to be compiled. While Punjab government also has a policy of providing financial compensation of Rs 3 lakh to bereaved families, comprehensive data on how many bereaved families were given compensation could not be sourced. On Thursday, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh pegged the number of deceased farmers at 112 while addressing a press conference on completion of four years of his government. The farmers died due to cold, ailments (mainly cardiac arrest), accidents or by suicide. The morcha calls all those who died as Shaheed (martyr). The Kisan Ekta Morcha, another independent social media account of Tractor to Twitter, which is following the farmers’ suicides and farmer organisation BKU Ekta Ugrahan has launched a campaign named ‘Know your Shaheed’ wherein details of the deceased farmers with photos are being posted on social media. “We have collected data from various sources, including newspaper reports, farm organisations or individual farmers. As per data collected by us, so far, 302 farmers have died due to multiple reasons during the protests either at borders of Delhi or while returning to their villages or after a few days of reaching their places,” said Sanyukt Kisan Morcha IT cell member Harinder Happy. “Over 300 farmers died during the protests but the central government never cared to shed a tear. It is the Kisan Morcha leadership, which once, during one of the meetings with central ministers, forced ministers to pay respects to the departed souls by holding two-minute maun (silence). The kisan morcha has announced to provide financial assistance to bereaved families and it will be provided,” said morcha leader Darshan Pal. BKU Ekta Ugrahan president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said, “While we appreciate Punjab government’s concern for the plight of farmers, we want it to count the farmers who died in the protests as the figure from Punjab is much more than 112 and compensation should be provided in all cases.” Kisan Morcha stated that so far, no one has been found to be Covid positive at the protest sites. The postmortem and viscera report of the 302 persons who died did not indicate Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cm-says-112-pb-farmers-died-during-protests-farm-bodies-seek-relief/articleshow/81577655.cms||Neel Kamal

---||Chandigarh||Meetings being held in border districts to mobilise farmers’ for protest||Tarn Taran: Farmer leaders held village-wise meetings in border districts of Punjab to motivate more farmers and local residents to join their 9th tractor trolley jatha that would leave for Delhi on March 21. “We are getting huge response from farmers of different states of India, yet we want more and more farmers to reach Delhi so we can build pressure on the Centre and make it accede to our demands,” claimed state general secretary, Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), Sarwan Singh Pandher. Sources said due to ongoing vegetable sowing and ensuing wheat harvesting season, many farmers were returning from Delhi, due to which farmer leaders were trying to motivate farmers to join them. At Khara village near Sarhali in Tarn Taran district, many farmers were seen preparing for the jatha. “At least 30 to 35 farmers from each village will leave for Delhi. They are not going to return immediately but stay for a long time and that’s why they have modified their tractors and trolleys to beat Delhi’s summer,” said Sukhwinder Singh, adding that a minimum of two tractors and trolleys would join the jatha from every village. Meanwhile, farmer leader Lakhwinder Singh Waryamnangal claimed that they would oppose tighter restrictions imposed by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) on purchase of wheat crop. He alleged that FCI had reduced moisture content, foreign matter, damaged and discoloured grain and had made procurement specifications stricter to discourage farmers. “We plan to hold joint protests in food grain markets across the state and if the government delays procurement of wheat crop, we will intensify our peaceful protest,” said Waryamnanagal. He claimed that farmers who were agitating at multiple borders of Delhi would return only after achieving their target of repealing the three farm laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/meetings-being-held-in-border-districts-to-mobilise-farmers-for-protest/articleshow/81577660.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Failure to follow the rules will lead to a lockdown,” Bhujbal said after reviewing the district’s Covid-19 situation. The review meeting with Bhujbal and agriculture minister Dada Bhuse was attended by divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game, police commissioner Deepak Pandey, district collector Suraj Mandhare, civic chief Kailas Jadhav, zilla parishad CEO Leena Bansod, district surgeon Ratna Ravkhande, among others. Bhujbal, who termed the current wave of infection as second wave, called upon the administration to strictly implement the Covid-19 norms to discourage unnecessary movement of the people and ensure all the Covid prevention norms are being followed. “If the rate of infection continues in the same manner then lockdown is inevitable,” warned Bhujbal. Bhujbal also noted that 80% of the patients were from urban pockets like Nashik, Sinnar, Niphad, Malegaon, Manmad, Chandwad, Nandgaon. “In the first phase, the administration was learning to fight against Covid-19, but now they are all geared up to deal with the pandemic. It is the people who are still not taking things seriously. They should contribute by wearing masks, using sanitisers and maintaining physical distancing,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/follow-rules-or-face-lockdown-says-bhujbal/articleshow/81574837.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Chandigarh||FCI specifications are attack against Punjab, claims SKM||Bathinda: Reacting to various specifications in procurement of wheat and paddy set anew by the Food Corporation of India (FCI), the 30 agri organisations of Punjab in a meeting on Thursday declared that farmers of Punjab will not submit the land record related papers. The farm organisations also urged the farmers of Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and other states not to submit their records. In this regard, a memorandum addressed to the Prime Minister will soon be handed over to all mandi secretaries. The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has severely opposed the FCI move of tightening procurement specifications for foodgrain and stated that this defied the many decades of procurement work. The morcha stated that FCI was proposing that moisture content be brought down to 12% from 14% in wheat, foreign matter reduced to 0.5% from 0.75%, slightly damaged grain decreased from 4% to 2%, and prevalence of shrivelled and broken grains from 6% to 4%. The proposals for uniform specifications of foodgrain for procurement under central pool also mentions that from now on there can be no prevalence of other foodgrain in wheat whereas till now it was allowed up to 2%. SKM in a statement released on Thursday said FCI was seeking land records details to set up DBT of the price for procured grain, knowing fully well that the actual cultivators in many cases were different from the land owners. The morcha said these moves was an attack on the ongoing movement and on Punjab which was on the forefront of the struggle. “Punjab and Haryana farmers will resist this very strongly and will chalk out a strategy for the same,” said SKM. The morcha has decided to mark the Muzara Lehar Shahadat Diwas on Friday to highlight the plight of tenant farmers all over India, in addition to expressing its resistance to FCI’s changed procurement norms and specifications. SKM constituent Jai Kisan Andolan claimed farmers were receiving significantly lower prices than the MSP promised by the government in different markets for channa/gram in states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Gujarat. The farmers on the count have got nearly Rs 140 crore less in just the first fortnight of March in just this one crop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fci-specifications-are-attack-against-punjab-claims-skm/articleshow/81577670.cms||---

---||Mumbai||‘Comedy of errors’ in HSC biology text, finds retd prof in Maharashtra||From basic grammar to facts, the standard XII biology textbook brought out by the state board, has many errors. Over a 100 mistakes have been pointed out by Hema Sane, a retired professor of biology from a college in Pune, in an 80-page report to the Balbharati which publishes textbooks for the state board. She said that the textbook contains personal opinions rather than facts and the language is poor. For example, the textbook says maize is pollinated by wind when it is an angiosperm— a fruit, and not a seed. It says a giraffe survives in famine and heat when it should say the African desert. Sane told TOI, “There are some instances in the book that show a complete lack of knowledge of the subject. The board exams are approaching and it is high time Balbharati rectifies these mistakes. Maharashtra is regarded as the most advanced in the country and it would be a matter of disgrace for the educational field if academicians outside the state were to see these mistakes.” Balbharati’s director Dinkar Patil said that the matter would be studied and corrections would be incorporated in the new version. Subject experts from Savitribai Phule Pune University supported Sane’s claims and said the textbook must be reviewed immediately. Last year, Sane had done a similar exercise for the biology text for class XI and pointed out errors. Balbharati corrected the errors in the new version. She also pointed out that the rules of singular and plural were glaringly missing and tenses were not in agreement. “English is the medium of teaching in science stream and the grammar in the textbooks should have been clean,” she said. The diagrams are extremely funny in some cases, said Sane. “For instance, on page 65, a coloured image of ‘Bonellia viridis’ is given. It looks like some animal is crossing a bridge,” she said. “Experts must refer to some standard books and not go wrong with images.” Patil said that they have received Sane’s report and all the corrections would be incorporated in the next version. “Suggestions are sought every year and errors, changes and rectifications pointed out are incorporated in the improved version of the textbook.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/comedy-of-errors-in-hsc-biology-text-finds-retd-prof-in-maharashtra/articleshow/81577706.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Speaking to the media at the district collectorate, where he reviewed the situation along with district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal on Thursday, the minister said: “The situation in Malegaon is becoming very grim. The rate of Covid positivity in the Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) has touched 61%. All measures are being taken to bring the situation under control.” According to Bhuse, Malegaon commissioner Deepak Kasar, who is currently on the leave, has been instructed to rejoin work immediately and take charge of the situation. Commissioner Kasar has been on leave and his deputy, who was handed over the charge has now himself tested positive for Covid-19. It may be noted that Malegaon town was one of the hotspots in Maharashtra in the April-May period last year, during the first wave of the pandemic. Bhuse pointed out that the corporation has been asked to ramp up testing so that patients can be identified early and treatment is started on time. “The corporation has been asked to increase the testing as per the standards announced by the state government with the ratio of 30 people tested for every patient identified,” Bhuse said. Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare said the work to ramp testing has been ordered and the survey of the patients and their relatives in the containment zones has started. “Infrastructure-wise, we are better placed than we were last year. Testing is the important factor. At this time, the rate of recovery in Malegaon, as far as the cases reported after February is concerned, is 99.5%,” collector said. Malegaon on Thursday reported 716 active Covid-19 cases. On Wednesday, 174 fresh cases were added to the tally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/malegaon-positivity-rate-at-61-civic-chief-told-to-return-to-duty/articleshow/81574844.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Mumbai||Why was I assigned serious probes if I was not competent, asks shunted cop||MUMBAI: IPS officer Sanjay Pandey on Thursday wrote to the chief minister questioning how he was assigned serious confidential inquiries in the recent past if he has not been a competent officer. Pandey’s letter follows the government’s decision on Wednesday to shift him to the Maharashtra State Security Corporation, considered an insignificant posting. He is the seniormost IPS officer in the state. In his letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray and home minister Anil Deshmukh, Pande stated, “If I was an incompetent officer with a much maligned record these oversights might be reasonable. But on the contrary it was recognising my competence and integrity, from among all the police officers in Maharashtra, I was entrusted serious confidential enquiries in the recent past.” Pandey has submitted a report against an additional DGP following complaints of his links with people of questionable background. Pandey, who was asked by the government to probe the matter, has also mentioned how a former city police commissioner threatened witnesses in this case and a senior IAS officer’s interference to stall the case. Pandey spoke about another confidential probe pertaining to a Pune-based reputed company where a former state DGP attempted to scuttle the probe. Based on Pandey’s report, a case was later registered. The letter further read, “I am anguished to state that for reasons unknown to me, my career as a police officer in Maharashtra state has been purposely blocked. I have for last several years been bearing out this injustice, but now with your recent orders/actions in the past few months I feel it is just to place this on record, with a hope that some course correction may still be possible.” In the last two months, Pandey is the third senior IPS officer of Maharashtra cadre to have expressed anger against the state government’s interference in policing and transferring policemen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiwhy-was-i-assigned-serious-probes-if-i-was-not-competent-asks-shunted-cop/articleshow/81576817.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Goa||Tourism industry in Canacona pins hope on new council||Poinguinim: Plagued with delays from the authorities in issuing licences and temporary power connection, locals of Canacona, who are in the tourism industry, are hopeful that the councillors will help resolve their issues. Canacona’s urban populace goes to polls on Saturday to elect a new municipal council. The coastal wards in Palolem, Patnem and Rajbhag-Tarir are mostly dependent on tourism and fishing and, like others, locals here had also suffered heavy losses during the lockdown. They now hope that the new council will help reduce the high unit cost of water and electricity and higher fees levied by different government departments, thus bringing them some relief. Most residents of the coastal wards, who are into tourism businesses, are expecting that the new council would raise their issues with authorities concerned including delay in granting licences, temporary electricity connections, help reduce the high unit cost of water and electricity and higher fees levied by different government departments. The Canacona municipality has 31 candidates in fray vying for 12 seats. The issues that need urgent attention in the municipal jurisdiction are effective garbage collection and disposal, narrow approach roads, poor mobile and internet connectivity, irregular water supply and power problems and parking facilities. The coastal wards in Palolem, Patnem and Rajbhag-Tarir are mostly dependent on tourism and fishing, and hence the locals demand for facilities to make tourism sustainable. The coastal areas has also suffered job losses due to the pandemic and diminishing coast line due to sand erosion. In Canacona, since the local MLA Isidore Fernandes switched over from Congress to BJP, the political dimension has undergone a change. The opposition here is considered weak to fight the ruling.  Though there are no panels formed, Fernandes said that most candidates in the fray have loyalties to BJP. Sources said that this is likely to make it a tough competition for most candidates.  As many outgoing councillors were unable to seek re-election in their wards following reservations, the candidates fielded by them will be tested in at least two wards at the polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tourism-industry-in-canacona-pins-hope-on-new-council/articleshow/81577807.cms||Albert Fernandes

---||Delhi||Metro to stop in its tracks so that you can get down, switch trains||NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has a knack for coming up with unique engineering solutions when faced with seemingly unbeatable challenges. Very soon, trains running on the Green Line (Inderlok-Brigadier Hoshiar Singh, Bahadurgarh) will stop in the tracks between the Punjabi Bagh and Shivaji Park stations. This first-of-a-kind project in the country is taking shape in west Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh. DMRC came up with the idea of platforms and train stoppages in the middle of the viaduct after failing to install more conventional methods of providing interchange facilities between the Green and Pink Lines even though the corridors criss-cross each other. There, the passengers will disembark from the train to steel platforms on both sides of the track and proceed over a pedestrian bridge to the Punjabi Bagh West station of the Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar). Work on this unique site gathered pace last year. While the 230-metre pedestrian bridge is nearing completion, the platforms will also soon take shape. DMRC received all mandatory approvals from Indian Railways in early 2020. “The platforms for both up and down movement are being built in steel and will come up right above the Punjabi Bagh roundabout. The Green Line viaduct will be modified to install these prefabricated steel platforms,” a DMRC spokesperson said. The spokesperson said that in 2010, the Chhatarpur metro station was built with prefabricated steel, but this was for the first time that DMRC was using steel to build a halt platform on an operational corridor. The steel structures are being fabricated separately in a factory by the contractor and will be brought to the site for installation, he said. According to the spokesperson, “There will not be any ticketing facility on the interchange platforms, only boarding and deboarding facilities for the benefit of passengers wishing to change trains between the two corridors.” The platforms will be 155 metres in length and will be connected with the pedestrian bridge by staircases and two extra-large lifts capable of carrying 26 people each, one on either platform. “The total height from the platform level of the new platforms to the concourse of the Punjabi Bagh West station of the Pink Line is 16.7 metres. Therefore, the passage has been planned at two levels,” the spokesperson explained. After coming down from the platform through staircases or lifts, the passengers will again have to take the stairs, the two escalators or the ‘through movement’ elevator to finally reach the concourse area of the Pink Line station. Though this special project is not part of either the Phase III or ongoing Phase IV projects of DMRC, it was expected to be completed by 2020. The Covid-19 outbreak, however, put a spanner in the works as construction came to a halt during the national lockdown. Even when construction activity was allowed, the pace of work got affected due to the unavailability of an adequate number of construction workers. The 59-km-long Pink Line has been designed as a 'ring' corridor, forming a circle across the existing metro corridors, with interchange facilities at 11 locations. The Green Line is the only corridor that the Pink Line crosses but does not connect with, depriving commuters of areas like Paschim Vihar, Nangloi, Punjabi Bagh, Madipur, etc., of direct connectivity with south Delhi. DMRC had initially planned an interchange of Pink Line with Green Line, but the considerable distance of 800 metres between Punjabi Bagh West station of the Pink Line and Shivaji Park station of the Green Line meant that the company was thinking in terms of a pedestrian bridge with travelators. But this would have required a wider bridge and DMRC was unable to find sufficient land available in the area. Because of the paucity of land for such a bridge, DMRC decided to connect the two corridors through feeder buses. But even that plan couldn’t materialise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metro-to-stop-in-its-tracks-so-that-you-can-get-down-switch-trains/articleshow/81595511.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The woman later lodged an FIR with the police. Vishnu Tamhane, senior inspector, Samarth police, told TOI, “The elderly woman left her home around noon for buying some medicines from a nearby pharmacy store. She was walking alone when one of the duo approached her near the Jain temple.” “The man asked the elderly woman where she was going and what medicines she wanted to buy. He then told her that his employer had become a father and was giving free medicines to elderly persons. He asked the woman to accompany him for a visit to his employer and she agreed,” Tamhane said. Tamhane said “The man, about 25 years old, took her behind the Jain temple and asked her to wait there. Within few minutes, his accomplice came to the spot and the duo offered her water to drink. The duo then gagged her with a piece of cloth to ensure that she did not scream. They then forcibly removed her gold bangles and ran away.” Tamhane said “We have registered a case of robbery and a police team is studying CCTV footages from the area to identify the duo.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duo-rob-elderly-woman-of-bangles-worth-rs70000/articleshow/81576821.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Cong walkout on FRBM Act amendment||Shimla: Noisy scenes were witnessed in the state legislative assembly on Thursday during the passing of Himachal Pradesh Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (Amendment) Bill, 2021 as the opposition accused the government of deceiving the people by increasing the limit of taking loan from 3% to 5% of the state’s gross domestic product. In protest, the opposition later walked out of the House while raising slogans. In the absence of opposition, the bill was passed in the assembly. CPM MLA Rakesh Singha, Leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri, Congress MLAs Jagat Singh Negi (Kinnaur), Harshvardhan Singh (Shillai) and Asha Kumari (Dalhousie) had opposed the proposal to pass the bill. In the absence of chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj had introduced the bill in the House. Bhardwaj said increasing the limit of taking loan was only for one year but Agnihotri called it as black day in the history of state even as Singha walked out after speaking in the House. Speaking to media persons outside the assembly, Agnihotri said the state government, by virtue of strength in the House, is passing the bills and taking loans instead of seeking financial help from the Centre. He said that nowhere in the budget was it mentioned that more loans would be taken. He said that in its five-year term, the BJP government would be taking Rs 35,000 crore loan. “We had said that the cabinet should reconsider the bill or it should be sent to a select committee or government should seek financial package for the state from the Union Government. If needed, opposition too would accompany the government to Delhi to seek financial package,” he said. Raising expenses by increasing debt is not a solution as the state has a debt burden of over Rs 60,000 crore, he added. Bhardwaj said Himachal has its own act and this is a technical matter. He said that it is a matter of regularising the 2019-20 expenditure and this is a one-time relaxation in fiscal deficit proposed for 2019-20. He said that present government is rectifying the mistake of the previous Congress regime. The minister alleged that Congress has plunged the state into a debt trap as under the previous Congress regime, fiscal deficit of GSDP was 3.60% in 2013-13, 4.23% in 2013-14 and 4.05% in 2014-15. Provisions of FRBM Act were violated by not making the required amendments and thr now state government has rectified it by bringing the amendment, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-walkout-on-frbm-act-amendment/articleshow/81577697.cms||---

The report also noted that considering 2013 as a baseline year, property prices in Pune increased by around 38% till the end of 2020, the highest among seven major cities in India . The average cost of a square foot of housing space, according to the report, stood at around Rs 5,510 in Pune, in2020. Mumbai remained the most expensive and the largest real estate market across the country, with its average square foot cost nearly double that of Pune at Rs10,610 till the end of 2020. But the report also noted that despite unsold inventory declining by around 6%, and prices bottoming out, stamp duty cuts and historically low rates on homes loans, apart from cuts in construction premiums, are making houses more accessible to people. The city’s eastern and western extremities, such as Wagholi and Wakad respectively, were one of the most dynamic housing markets, with prices increasing by nearly 20% in the seven-year period. “Pune is also one of the most livable cities as per the report of the Union government.

---||Nashik||‘European strain’ detected among Covid patients in Nashik||NASHIK: Nashik district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal on Thursday said that a “European strain” has been found among some of patients who have tested positive for Covid-19. On instructions from NIV, Pune, the Nashik district administration had sent 26 random swab samples from Nashik city, the rural areas and Malegaon, of which 30% were found to have the said strain. “We have just received reports that 30% of the random samples have the European strain. People need to be careful about its spread,” Bhujbal said. Dr Utkarsh Dudhedia, chief coordinator for the Covid-19 tests in Nashik district, said the people whose samples tested positive at NIV did not have any travel history, which indicated that the strain was spreading in the district. The samples were randomly picked from respective regions as had been marked by the laboratory. Dudhedia categorically pointed out that the strain was not from UK but from other European nations. “The transmission of this strain is extremely fast and that is the primary reason why Covid-19 cases in Nashik are rising rapidly. Besides, the strain is relatively weak in nature and hence it could be possible that despite the rise in cases, the death rate in Nashik is still low,” Dudhedia said, adding that all those whose samples were taken about 15 days ago had been cured of the infection. Civil surgeon Ratna Raokhande said the treatment protocol for the new strain remains the same. “The best protective gear we have to combat this virus is wearing masks, washing hands and keeping physical distance. Citizens do not appear to be practising this and hence more people are getting infected,” Raokhande said. Raokhande said, “There is nothing to worry about this strain since the treatment protocol is the same and the rate of people getting cured is also very high. It may also be noted that most of those infected are either asymptomatic or very mildly symptomatic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/european-strain-detected-among-covid-patients-in-nashik/articleshow/81574857.cms||Abhilash Botekar

With help from Anand Van Mitra Mandal (AVMM), residents undertook an initiative to clean up the garbage along the road and footpath by planting bougainvillea saplings. This garbage is often burnt, giving rise to smoke, which is a major health concern. After repeated requests to local authorities to address the situation, residents found a solution themselves.“The residents of NIBM Road cherish the greenery around the place, but over the years empty spaces are being filled with garbage. We took up the responsibility of cleaning these areas and planting bougainvilleas to encourage people not to litter. The aim is to make the entire stretch from Bizbay chowk to NIBM chowk a garbage-free and green area,” said Parveen Tambe, president of NIBM-Undri Road Residents’ Forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-plant-bougainvillea-to-combat-garbage-dumping/articleshow/81576839.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Rs 113 crore plan to provide water, toilets to schools||KOLKATA: An international NGO that has been working on improving sanitation in public schools in Kolkata since 2012 plans to spend Rs 96 crore over the next two-and-a-half years to install water filtration systems, drinking and handwashing stations, and improved toilets and urinals in 1,200 government schools under the Sarva Siksha Mission, under which 4 lakh students are enrolled. It is also carrying out interventions that include delivering hygiene education and menstrual health training through focal teachers and child cabinets. “The interventions are intended to bring about long-term behaviour change in stakeholders,” said Splash India country director, Manish Joshi. Splash International is headquartered in Seattle, US. The Rs 113 crore WASH-in-Schools for Everyone (WISE) programme, which was rolled out in 2019 to provide safe drinking water, handwashing and improved toilets in all government and civic schools across the city, was disrupted by Covid in 2020. Till the end of last year, Rs 17.2 crore has been spent to provide improved drinking water and sanitation facilities in 194 schools, where 84,000 children study. This year, the programme will be extended to 130 more schools, where over 50,000 children study. The rest of the schools will be covered in 2022 and 2023. “In the context of the current pandemic, the programme is helping the state implement the guidelines on healthy and hygienic conditions in schools for their reopening,” said Joshi, adding that it will lead to healthier students and improved school attendance, especially for girls. The NGO is currently working across eight countries in Asia and Africa — Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Ethiopia, India, Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam. Kolkata is the second city after Adis Ababa, where the WASH programme is being implemented in all schools. Splash has also played a key role in providing access to safe drinking water at all orphanages across China. After the programme is implemented in Kolkata, the organisation intends to replicate ‘WASH in school model’ in partnership with other NGOs and state and municipal governments across India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rs-113cr-plan-to-provide-water-toilets-to-schools/articleshow/81576837.cms||Subhro Niyogi

---||Delhi||Govt honours handicraft artisans with state awards||New Delhi: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and minister of the department of industries Satyendar Jain felicitated handicraft artisans at the State Awards for Selected Craft Persons on Friday. Sisodia said that today the competition to produce products was very high, and many countries produce it very cheaply, other than 3-D printing. “These products are not as good as handicrafts and will never be. Handicrafts are very special and no other country or technology can bring such products,” he said, adding that handicrafts are not business to artisans, but a way of living and tradition for our country. “Art is life for Indians and that is why we respect artisans. We cannot survive only on machines. We will organise exhibitions and utilise platforms like Dilli Haat. If you have any ideas then please share that with us,” the deputy CM said. A total of 16 skilled artisans were selected for the awards for the years 2016 and 2017. Applauding the winners, Jain said that every state has its unique speciality, but Delhi has an amalgamation of all Indian cultures, terming the capital ‘Mini-Bharat’. Jain said that all governments should make vigorous efforts to promote handicrafts. He also said that the culture today was heavily influenced by the industrial ideology and hence, the focus is on quantity and not quality. “The pandemic caused a delay in the organisation of the function, but we will soon felicitate the artisans for the years 2019 and 2020. I think we must hold a public demonstration of the compositions by the awardees of the past 5 years to bring their art, craft, and talent before the eyes of the public so that they become cognisant of the rich cultural heritage of our nation,” Jain said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-honours-handicraft-artisans-with-state-awards/articleshow/81595522.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Insufficient contact tracing has led to sustained transmission’||MUMBAI: The Central team that recently visited the state to investigate the surge in Covid-19 cases has questioned the contact tracing methodology currently being used and asked for reorientation of field staff. On the ground, shortage of manpower in several districts appears to be the main hurdle in the “test, treat and track” initiative, considered key to control the spread of coronavirus. The team comprising Dr P Ravindran from the union health ministry, public health specialist Dr Sunil Khaparde and Dr Sanket Kulkarni, deputy director of National Centre for Disease Control, visited Maharashtra between March 7 and 11. Among other things, the team observed while on paper the case-contact ratio was 1:20 in the state, the field staff didn’t understand the concept of contact tracing entirely. The volunteers are mainly listing the immediate family and neighbourhood contacts for “the sake of listing”, the team found. “The high-risk contacts in workplace settings, social settings and family settings were not investigated and listed,” the team wrote in their report submitted to the union health ministry and even shared with the state. It has prompted them to ask for training of field staff involved in contact tracing with an emphasis on interpersonal communication skills. Significantly, they found monitoring of contacts was limited to conveying the message to high-risk ones for testing the very next day and not after five days as instructed by Indian Council of Medical Research. Worryingly, the “limited” tracing was leading to a large pool of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic contacts not being tracked at all. They said the absence of rigorous tracing, testing and containment was leading to sustained community transmission. A senior state government official said opening up of all sectors has led to increased movement across the state, which is proving to be a challenge in contact tracing. “In cities like Mumbai, we don’t find people at home,” said the official. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray also mentioned these challenges at the meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said Mumbai and Pune have established health systems and trained people to carry out contact tracing. Smaller districts with limited health infrastructure and personnel are finding it challenging. “During lockdown, we had pooled in state bus drivers and conductors for contact tracing, but such people have resumed their work,” he said. A senior official from Dhule said they are training people to take medical history more meticulously.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiinsufficient-contact-tracing-has-led-to-sustained-transmission/articleshow/81574852.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Vijayawada||Jagan launches RBK TV channel to improve cultivation practices||Vijayawada: Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, during a review meeting on agriculture at his Tadepalli camp office on Thursday, launched the Rythu Bharosa Kendra (RBK) television channel for farmers. The CM said that RBKs were established to support farmers in all activities, ranging from sowing seeds to selling their crop. He explained that new buildings were being constructed to house RBKs in villages so that farmers have a permanent place to approach for their needs. Jagan also reviewed the procurement of Rabi crop production for 2020-21 and preparations for Kharif 2021-22. Speaking about the RBK TV channel, Jagan said it will provide farmers information on crops and weather conditions. “With Smart TVs being set up at RBKs, the channel will help farmers get information on precautions to be taken while farming and information on weather conditions,” he said and added that a toll-free number (155251) has been set up to address problems raised by farmers at RBKs. The chief minister instructed the agriculture minister and secretary to come up with a system to address doubts of farmers in RBKs in an interactive manner with scientists. He said the state government has been taking revolutionary steps as part of the process of bringing them closer and making them more resourceful for the farmers. Jagan said farmers should not be cheated on purchase of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides through RBKs and added that authorities have been testing the products at RBKs in order to give guarantee and quality certification with government stamp on them. He said the aim is to make the orders available to the farmers in the villages within 48 to 72 hours of placing them. The chief minister wanted the agriculture assistants to work from village secretariats and be available to the farmers. “The price list of every crop and the crop pattern of every village must be displayed at the RBKs,” he said. He wanted officials to ensure minimum support price (MSP) to farmers. The CM said if any farmer has to sell his crop for less than minimum support price in any village, he can register a complaint with the RBK. The agriculture assistant of that village should inform the government by uploading details in CMAPP, he said. He further said that marketing department would intervene and ensure the crop is sold at a fair price and if not, it should procure the crop from the farmer directly. This process will be done under the purview of the joint collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jagan-launches-rbk-tv-channel-to-improve-cultivation-practices/articleshow/81575298.cms||Gopi Dara

The Bombay high court bench of Justice S S Shinde and Justice Manish Pitale had on Wednesday asked special public prosecutor Shishir Hiray to inform it on Thursday whether the state and police wished to continue their investigation against Goswami and ARG Outlier. On Thursday, public prosecutor Deepak Thakare appeared before the bench and said it wished to continue the investigation. “We have a right to investigate. We have some material,” said Thakare, appearing with Hiray. He said they would require some time to finish their investigation in the case. The high court bench asked how much time would they take and observed that with three months gone, there was not much to show as material to array the petitioners as accused. The HC was hearing a petition filed by Goswami and his company to quash the FIR in the TRP scam or to transfer investigation to the CBI. Goswami said they are not named in the FIR and his counsel Ashok Mundargi said it was intentional, to harass him, by keeping it open-ended. The court said if the petition succeeds, a clause in the chargesheet filed in the TRP case referring to owners and operators of the channel as “suspects” can be set aside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/arnab-will-not-face-coercive-action-for-two-weeks-state-in-mumbai/articleshow/81577843.cms||---

The term of the member secretary of GSPCB has also been extended. Shetgaonkar’s tenure had come to end in December 2020, and with the first extension for three months, his term ended on March 15. A senior official said that the government will invite fresh applications for the chairman’s post. Eight persons have applied for the top post - Shetgaonkar, Chandrashekher Rivonker, Dr KG Gupta, Rajas Salkar, Mahesh Patil, Dr Manoj Borkar, Dr Ulhas Sawaikar and Dr Dipak Gaitonde, and another four for the post of member secretary - current member secretary Dr Shamila Monteiro, Maria Fernandes, Derrick Fernandes and Dr Geeta Nagvenkar. “We have got very few applications for the post of the chairman of GSPCB,” the official said. In October, the department of environment and climate change advertised for the posts of chairperson and member secretary for GSPCB.

---||Amaravati||Encourage private players in power networks: Centre||AMARAVATI: In what could be a big jolt to public sector power companies, the Centre has directed state governments to encourage entry of private players in transmission and distribution networks. The Centre noted that private players would not only bring investments to the sector but also lower costs, helping consumers to benefit. The Centre’s advice is creating ripples in the energy sector in the state. In a letter to chief secretaries, Mritunjay Kr Narayan, joint secretary to the Union government (power ministry), has noted that Tariff Based Competitive Bidding (TBCB) adopted for inter-state power transmission has helped save huge monies to the exchequer. “It has been observed that competitive bidding has brought tariff down by 40 per cent thanks to the participation of a large number of bidders,” said Narayan. He explained that it has lessened the burden on the government and attract private investments for taking up developmental projects in the sector. Narayan said that the scarce funds could be utilized for other priority programmes. The TBCB would also encourage risk sharing with private sector and encourages bringing in advanced and new technologies to the sector. He, however, said that it is high-time for the state governments to switch to the new method in intra-state transmission as major share in the transmission sector is from intra-state. He said that state should take the success lessons from the TBCB adopted in the inter-state transmission for intra-state transmission. “It effectively lessens the burden on the state governments if they can move over to the TBCB system in the intra-state transmission,” said Narayan. He said that such measures would also help consumers to benefit as lower tariffs would enable state governments to bring down retail tariff. “In the larger interests of the consumers, it is strongly recommended that the state governments should adopt Tariff Based Competitive Bidding (TBCB) immediately,” the joint secretary said. Narayan said that Electricity Act, 2003 has provides conducive environment for investments in all segments of electricity sector by removing the barrier to entry different sectors. He said that Section 63 of the Act provides for participation of private sector on competitive basis in different segments so as to encourage private investment. “The Centre’s decision to force the state governments to go allow the private firms into transmission sector is nothing but going for privatization of entire transmission and distribution companies. This is what we have been apprehending about for the past several months since the Centre amended the Electricity Act,” said a senior engineer of AP Transco. He said that entry of private players would not help reduce the tariff but increase them multifold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/encourage-pvt-players-in-power-networks-centre/articleshow/81575637.cms||Samdani MN
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Dharavi 1st slum cluster to get vaccination centre next week||MUMBAI: Vaccination in slums is finally set to take off in the city and BMC plans to initiate the exercise next week in the dense slum cluster of Dharavi. Looking at rising Covid cases in the area, BMC aims to vaccinate the senior population and those with comorbidities by setting up a vaccination centre at an urban health centre, popularly known as ‘Chhota Sion Hospital’. On Thursday, Dharavi witnessed a single-day spike in cases to 30. The last time the locality had reported more than 30 cases in a day (33) was almost six months ago on September 11. Thereafter, the numbers had stayed below 30. Covid-19 had entered Dharavi on April 1 last year and there were days when it had reported more than 80 cases. For instance, on May 3 last year, 95 cases were reported in one day while on May 15, there were 84. On December 25, the area reported zero cases for the first time since the pandemic. For a long period, Covid cases stayed below 20. Now, looking at the rise in numbers, the plan to start a vaccination centre will be implemented soon. A senior BMC official said they are working out the logistics for setting it up. Currently, anyone from the locality who wants to be vaccinated mostly heads to the Bandra-Kurla Complex jumbo facility. Though the official population of the area is 6.5 lakh, it is estimated to be 8.5 lakh with unaccounted-for migrants. Senior citizens make up around 1.7 lakh of the total population. Civic officials estimate they would need to vaccinate around 2 lakh people if those with co-morbities are also considered. There are plans to rope in community leaders to request the locals to come forward to get vaccinated while private doctors would be asked to assist in giving out certificates for patients with co-morbidities. Well aware that several senior citizens in the locality may not know how to register on the Co-Win app, officials are also planning to set up desks in the area where NGO staff can help them. “We will also have multiple booths within the centre so that there is no crowding and vaccination doses can be administered in a phase-wise manner. We already have data from the ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ campaign of families in the locality which would be used to ensure maximum seniors and patients with co-morbidities are vaccinated. Certificates for patients with co-morbidities would be given at our health posts as well,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaidharavi-1st-slum-cluster-to-get-vax-centre-next-wk/articleshow/81574948.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Ahmedabad||Businesses take pandemic challenge head on||Ahmedabad: A tumultuous time had begun for each and every business soon after the lockdown of 2020 was announced just before FY 2019-2020 was about to close. While companies grappled with the new normal of staff working from home, industrial production in the manufacturing-heavy state of Gujarat came to a grinding halt. Consequently, the state revenues too, took a hit. However, by cutting margins, innovating, embracing automation, identifying the need-gap and scaling production to match market requirements, the businesses have bounced back, with several industry sectors eyeing growth and several others on the path of slow but steady revival as we approach the end of the financial year 2020-21. Pharma sector rises to the occasion The state’s pharmaceutical sector not only bounced back quickly after the disruptions caused by the lockdown last year, but also grabbed the opportunities thrown up by the pandemic. Pharma firms began producing key medicines, including remdesivir, used in the treatment of Covid-19. Large number of factories came up across the states to manufacture masks, hand sanitizers, PPEs and other protective gears. The supply of medical grade oxygen and vitamins was also stepped up with the entry of new players. Several big corporate firms ventured into making hand sanitizers and other protective gears. Raw material prices shock and shake At a time when industries were getting back on their feet, unexpected and sudden rise in the prices of raw materials dealt a blow to several industries such as real estate, plastics, ice cream, textiles, chemicals and engineering to name a few. The prices of numerous materials have shot up due to a variety of reasons, including supply constraints. Real estate and plastic industry bodies have even sought the government’s intervention to arrest spiralling prices of cement and steel as well as polymers. New normals with remote working Soon after the lockdown, companies across both manufacturing as well as services sector sent their employees to work from home. But for most companies, the phenomenon is here to stay. According to industry experts, a paradigm shift in job roles is expected and accordingly, companies are open to hiring talent from remote working locations. Hybrid models have worked well in manufacturing and services sectors. Part of the staff is working out of home and only those necessary to be present on the factory shopfloor are deployed there. Manufacturing back to full throttle With production activity coming to a grinding halt during the lockdown of 2020, the manufacturing sector was adversely hit not just in terms of supply chain and manpower challenges, but also in revenue inflows. Despite demand taking a major hit even post lockdown as revival of retail and exports was slow, industries in Gujarat shook off the de-growth phase and recovered well in the second half of 2020. While sectors such as textile and ready-made garments, chemicals, ceramics, engineering goods and auto component manufacturers witnessed a decline in industrial production, output levels bounced back by the second half of 2020-21. “Most companies cut costs by minimizing production to serve only pending orders and rationalising manpower costs by temporarily reducing income during the initial half. But as pent-up demand found release, pipeline stocks got exhausted and the market began reviving, so production levels improved. Industries also embraced digitization and automation in a big way,” said Chintan Thaker, chairman, Assocham Gujarat State Council. Gems and jewellery demand at all-time low The demand for gems and jewellery sector was at an all-time low in 2020, thanks to the rising gold prices and weakened consumer confidence. As gold prices kept on increasing, tracing the international rally and touching the peak of Rs 58,000 per 10 gram in the Ahmedabad market, demand for both jewellery as well as bullion took a major hit. Yellow metal imports in Gujarat declined by a significant 55% in the calendar year 2020 against 2019 backed by poor demand, increased recycling of gold and high gold prices. It was only after the very recent reduction in basic customs duty on gold that the demand improved to some extent. Tourism, hospitality and services grapples for revival amid third wave The tourism, hospitality and services sector was among those worst affected by the pandemic. With international travel coming to a grinding halt, revenue inflows of travel agents as well as hotels dropped by a significant 50% or even more. In the second half of 2020-21, industry players said that leisure travel within India began picking up, but the uptakes were low thanks to territorial lockdowns and restrictions. Occupancy levels at hotels have failed to revive and tend to get little cushion with weddings and events. The plight of the restaurant industry is also no better amid rising cost of operations and limited revenues. Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA) – Gujarat, said “At a time when the industry had barely begun to revive and hoping to recover its lost revenues, curfew timings were once again revised from 10pm onwards. With this, income will take a hit.” GST Collection declines 7.1% in 2020 As a clear impact of the lockdown imposed to keep Covid-19 in control, the collection in Goods and Services Tax (GST) has declined. According to data by the Union ministry of finance, total GST collection in Gujarat went down by 7.1% from Rs 76,791 crore in 2019 to Rs 71,328 crore in 2020. The decline in state revenues will clearly impact public spending of the government, say experts, and it will in turn affect the progress of public welfare projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/businesses-take-pandemic-challenge-head-on/articleshow/81576905.cms||Niyati Parikh

They thereafter used a ladder to jump the boundary wall. While two of them have been traced at their homes and brought back, the rest continue to be missing. A guard who went up to the children’s room in the morning was the first to discover that they were missing. District probation officer Vyoma Jain said, “When the guard after repeated knocking didn’t get an answer, he investigated and saw that the second floor window was broken and sheets and blankets were dangling from it. We immediately informed police, who reached the spot and started an investigation.” While six inmates were at the centre on charges of theft, the seventh was serving time under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. “Two of the boys were found within hours from their homes. We hope to find the rest soon,” said Nainital SSP Preeti Priyadarshini. Meanwhile, Jain added that an investigation was also on to see if there was a mistake on the staff’s part. “We will enhance our security system so that such an incident does not happen again,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/seven-inmates-escape-haldwani-juvenile-correctional-home-2-brought-back/articleshow/81575657.cms||Prashant Jha

She also accused the councillor of uttering caste-based abuses. Filing an FIR with Khokhra police on Wednesday, the woman, who works as in charge of urban health centre in Khokhra, said that sanitation worker Arjun Sodha and his father Jagdish threatened her first on February 26 over an issue of attendance irregularity. She said that even though Arjun remained absent most of the days in February, his father forced her to mark his presence. When she objected, he threatened her with dire consequences and gheraoed her in her office on February 26. She, then, submitted an application to Khokhra police. At the time, local Congress councillor Apoorva Patel reached there and forced her to strike a compromise in the case. As Patel had arrived with a huge crowd, she settled the issue with Jagdish and Arjun, the complainant stated. She told police, “On March 15, when she was attending a vaccination programme, Patel hurled casteist slurs at her. Upset, she took sick leave on March 16.” On Wednesday, she was informed that she has been transferred to another health centre. Aggrieved by this, she consumed poison to commit suicide. Later, she filed a complaint of harassment with Khokhra police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abused-by-councillor-woman-health-worker-poisons-self/articleshow/81577045.cms||---

The woman, who was returning from Bettiah after appearing in the Bihar police constable examination on March 14, was allegedly raped and murdered by an auto-rickshaw driver whom she had hired to return home after reaching Bagaha the same evening. According to the police, the auto driver had poured acid on her face after committing the crime at an unidentified location. The man has been arrested. The body of the deceased, a resident of Kadamahawa Chhopitola village under Chiutaha police station in Bagaha-2 block, was found dumped on the Tirbeni canal bank near Pratappur village under Semara police station on Thursday morning. The auto driver revealed the location of the body during interrogation, police said. The body was brought to the sub-divisional hospital at Bagaha for autopsy, where the police had to face the ire of villagers. Traffic remained paralysed for a few hours on the Bettiah-Bagaha- NH727 as agitators demanded capital punishment for the accused. The blockade was lifted after Bagaha SP Kiran Kumar Jadhav reached the spot and assured the protestors of timely and strict action. Police sources said the girl’s father had lodged a complaint at Chiutaha police station on March 15 after she did not return home the previous night. The girl’s father mentioned the registration number of the auto-rickshaw as she had told him over the phone after hiring it. Based on the complaint, police arrested the driver Raju Baidha. Bagaha SP Jadhav said prima facie the case was of rape and murder but he was waiting for the autopsy report. Local residents, including women and young girls, held a candle march in Bagaha town on Thursday demanding capital punishment for the accused.

The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act section for financing of illicit trafficking of drugs attracts a maximum sentence of 20 years. The defence cited the alleged recordings and its contents as additional grounds for seeking relief and urged the court to hear them in the interest of justice. Prakash had sought pre-arrest bail on October 31. A former manager of Deepika Padukone, she has been booked in the drugs case being probed in connection with the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput last year. In the plea, the defence said prior to November 25, 2020, Prakash was being forced to change her lawyers and appoint the one suggested. The plea further said there was a conference call between Prakash, the officer and the advocate he had wanted her to engage, where she was guaranteed if she paid heed, Section 27A would not be applied. The court directed the prosecution to reply to the plea. It will come up for hearing on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiceleb-mgr-cites-ncb-officers-recording-for-pre-arrest-bail/articleshow/81575048.cms||---

---||Bhopal||How first ‘containment zone’ Professors’ Colony became the face of pandemic||Bhopal: A year has elapsed since Bhopal residents first heard something called a ‘containment zone’. It was during the same period in 2020 when murmurs regarding coronavirus grew louder in Bhopal. When a girl, who studied in the UK and had returned home due to the pandemic in that country, she was found Covid-positive and Professors' Colony, where she lived with her parents, was barricaded from all sides and the entire locality declared a ‘containment zone’. Residents of Bhopal could see what lay in store for them if the pandemic took root in the city. It was also a period of political crisis in the state, but the fear of corona soon started dominating the people’s minds, pushing the then political upheaval in MP to the backburner. As we come full circle from the initial days of the pandemic, much of the rules put in place then have reversed.Initially, guidelines regarding containment zones were followed quite literally and people could see barricades for the first containment zone beginning from Roshanpura Square, just ahead of Raj Bhavan and MLB Girls' College on other sides.“One-km radius from the epicentre (house of the infected person),” was the rule and it was being followed quite literally.People were barred from coming out if their houses. Those liviing in 50 houses on both sides of the ‘epicentre’ were supposed to be medically tested for Covid-19 infection. A Rapid Action Force under the SDM’s supervision was in place to ensure that essential goods reached the houses of people and other things like sanitisation of the area in the epicentre’s proximity and testing of people living in the area is carried out and people not allowed to go in or out of the barricaded area. There were conflicting reports on how well all this was done, but there were complaints that residents of Professors' Colony had to struggle to get milk and vegetables for days together.There were also reports in media, including TOI, that testing was not carried out of as many people (residents in 50 houses on both sides of the epicentre as was the norm) nor was the area properly sanitised. Residents of the area also complained that the two milk parlours in the colony were closed during the period anf people were going out of the barricaded area to get milk. Policemen, who were deployed at the gates to stop them, were liberal enough to let them go to fetch essential commodities like milk.Yet, life in a contaimment zone was a terrible experience, more so for residents of the area, where infected persons were found initially. It was the administration’s belief that by isolating an entire area as containment zone, they could prevent or at least slow down the spread of the virus. Now, the situation is different. The administration itself is advising infected persons to live in ‘home isolation’ rather than packing them off to a Covid Care Centre, putting a notice on the gate of his house and barricading an entire area for four weeks.Incidentally, inner barricading in Professors' Colony had continued far beyond one month though the barricades on the outer edges had been removed. Now, in the same colony, if four persons of a family are found infected by coronavirus, they remain in home isolation, are treated by doctors through telephone and video calls and even their neighbhours don't come to know of their illness, let alone the whole colony or perhaps, the entire city coming to know that someone is down with coronavirus in Professors' Colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/how-first-containment-zone-professors-colony-became-the-face-of-pandemic/articleshow/81575675.cms||---

Addressing the media after attending an in-person inquiry at CID’s regional office in Vijayawada, Ramakrishna Reddy also claimed that around 3,000 to 3,500 acres of assigned lands to SC/STs are suspected to have been snatched in Tadikonda constituency as well. “If Chandrababu Naidu did not commit any mistake, why can’t he come out in the open and explain himself. Why can’t both (Chandrababu and Narayana) submit themselves for investigation,” he said. The MLA appeared before CID sleuths at their regional office in Satyanarayanapuram at around 11 am. He also stated that this case has nothing to do with CID’s insider trading cases that were filed in the past. “I have submitted whatever information I have to the CID. I also requested them to look into the irregularities with the assigned lands that took place in Tadikonda as well,” he added. Ramakrishna Reddy, who happens to be the complainant in the case, alleged that the previous government had brought in government order GO MS 41 to ‘snatch lands’ and not just those belonging to Dalits but also some of those owned by ex-servicemen as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/500-acres-assigned-lands-snatched-mla-tells-cid/articleshow/81575603.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Pune||Maharashtra: ‘Insufficient contact tracing has led to sustained transmission’||MUMBAI: The Central team that recently visited the state to investigate the surge in Covid-19 cases has questioned the contact tracing methodology currently being used and asked for reorientation of field staff. On the ground, shortage of manpower in several districts appears to be the main hurdle in the “test, treat and track” initiative, considered key to control the spread of coronavirus. The team comprising Dr P Ravindran from the union health ministry, public health specialist Dr Sunil Khaparde and Dr Sanket Kulkarni, deputy director of National Centre for Disease Control, visited Maharashtra between March 7 and 11. Among other things, the team observed while on paper the case-contact ratio was 1:20 in the state, the field staff didn’t understand the concept of contact tracing entirely. The volunteers are mainly listing the immediate family and neighbourhood contacts for “the sake of listing”, the team found. “The high-risk contacts in workplace settings, social settings and family settings were not investigated and listed,” the team wrote in their report submitted to the union health ministry and even shared with the state. It has prompted them to ask for training of field staff involved in contact tracing with an emphasis on interpersonal communication skills. Significantly, they found monitoring of contacts was limited to conveying the message to high-risk ones for testing the very next day and not after five days as instructed by Indian Council of Medical Research. Worryingly, the “limited” tracing was leading to a large pool of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic contacts not being tracked at all. They said the absence of rigorous tracing, testing and containment was leading to sustained community transmission. A senior state government official said opening up of all sectors has led to increased movement across the state, which is proving to be a challenge in contact tracing. “In cities like Mumbai, we don’t find people at home,” said the official. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray also mentioned these challenges at the meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said Mumbai and Pune have established health systems and trained people to carry out contact tracing. Smaller districts with limited health infrastructure and personnel are finding it challenging. “During lockdown, we had pooled in state bus drivers and conductors for contact tracing, but such people have resumed their work,” he said. A senior official from Dhule said they are training people to take medical history more meticulously.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mumbaiinsufficient-contact-tracing-has-led-to-sustained-transmission/articleshow/81580078.cms||Bhavika Jain

Covid-19 cases have started increasing again in the last few days and the state recorded three deaths and 278 cases on Wednesday. With a majority of colleges and universities holding examinations, the spread of Covid-19 in schools and hostels has triggered widespread panic among students and parents. The Telangana Engineering Joint Action Committee (JAC) has asked state universities to change the exam centre to colleges within city limits. Students rue that it’s not just the distance but also the pandemic due to which it was way more difficult to attend examinations at centres outside the city. “It is very difficult for students having back to back exams to travel 5-6 hours a day. Instead of making students travel outside the city to attend their exams, that too during a pandemic, please change the centre to colleges within the city limits,” Telangana Engineering Students’ Joint Action Committee said in a letter to JNTU-H and Osmania University on Thursday. Students of Osmania University have sought change in exam centres for the odd semester exams, scheduled to be held from March 30 and April 8. Students worry that these exam centres might turn out to be hotspots, if measures were not taken by the universities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rise-in-no-of-cases-worries-students/articleshow/81577815.cms||---

We have currently stationed the buses at the Verna industrial estate,” a KTC official said. The buses are going to be lined up near the Mercedes Benz showroom at the Panaji to Old Goa bypass road. The buses will be flagged off on March 23 at 10.30am by chief minister Pramod Sawant in the presence of transport minister Mauvin Godinho and KTC officials. The buses have been charged and kept ready for the big day. However, full-swing operations of the electric buses in the state will commence from April 1 onwards. Running on electric energy, the buses require to be recharged at designated electric charging stations – infrastructure for which is yet to be set up all over Goa. Currently, there is only one charging station in the state – at the KTC depot at Margao. This will be main hub for e-charging the vehicles and maintenance works. “More charging stations at other KTC bus stands are in the process of being erected. Two stations will be set up in Panaji, and one each in Vasco, Canacona and Mapusa,” the official said. A total of 30 of the 50 electric buses have arrived in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kadamba-set-to-flag-off-electric-buses-next-week/articleshow/81577822.cms||---
---||Goa||Rainfall forecast from Mar 21||PANAJI: There is a possibility of the formation of thunderstorm clouds over Goa that is likely to bring rain over parts of the state from March 21. The reason is being attributed to a trough forming in the western coast at a height of 1.5km. Observations of the India meteorological department (IMD) show that at 1.5km height and around 1km height there could be an increase in moisture inflow. By that time, there could be moisture incursion in the middle troposphere and a slight rise in temperature by around one degree Celsius from the present value. This could result in thunderstorm clouds. “We are therefore expecting some rainfall to take place from March 21 onwards. This may prolong for two to three more days – up to the first half of coming week,” IMD scientist, Rahul M said. He further said that the rainfall activity is likely to start from the eastern side and thunderstorm clouds developed over the eastern boarders of Goa are expected to move towards the coastal side. “We however do not expect widespread or vigorous activity of rainfall. Isolated thunderstorm activity only may begin probably during the afternoon hours from March 21,” Rahul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rainfall-forecast-from-mar-21/articleshow/81577852.cms||---
---||Delhi||Elevated corridor linking INA to IGI airport gets nod||NEW DELHI: A Rs 5,000 crore project, which will connect Sarai Kale Khan to Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport, was approved on Friday in the governing body meeting of Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning & Engineering) Centre—the apex body for traffic and transportation projects in the capital. The meeting was chaired by LG Anil Baijal. Sources said that while the Barapullah flyover already connects Sarai Kale Khan directly with INA, a new elevated corridor would be created from INA to the Delhi airport. The elevated corridor is expected to accommodate a rise in vehicular traffic when the redevelopment of eight General Pool Residential Accommodation (GPRA) colonies in south Delhi is completed. Baijal tweeted that he chaired the meeting with Delhi Development Authority (DDA) vice-chairman and other experts. He tweeted that after detailed deliberations, the proposals that were approved included an integrated transit corridor development and street network/connectivity plan for the corridor and influence zone from Sarai Kale Khan to IGI Airport. One of the other proposals that were approved was a multi-modal integration plan for Karkardooma Delhi Metro Station. He also tweeted that status of implementation of other projects earlier approved by the governing council was also reviewed in detail. “Emphasised on the officials of various agencies to ensure time- bound completion of projects by way of effective monitoring as against laid down timelines,” Baijal tweeted. The integrated transit corridor is expected to start from Kidwai Nagar and also cover other GPRA colonies in south Delhi — Thyagraj Nagar, Srinivaspuri, Kasturba Nagar Sarojini Nagar, Nauroji Nagar and Netaji Nagar. Though the final alignment of the elevated corridor is yet to be finalised, it is likely that after starting from Kidwai Nagar, it would pass through the Brigadier Hoshiyar Sing Marg to reach Africa Avenue and from there to Nelson Mandela Road and finally end at the Mahipalpur underpass near the Delhi airport. While the work of redevelopment of GPRA colonies is being carried out by NBCC, the corridor would be constructed by the central public works department. The feasibility study of the project, however, was carried out by the Delhi public works department. Once the Barapullah flyover is extended to Mayur Vihar, residents of trans-Yamuna would get direct access to the airport through the proposed corridor. This would also mean that traffic load on the existing Dhaula Kuan stretch would be eased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/elevated-corridor-linking-ina-to-igi-gets-nod/articleshow/81595597.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Mining mafia thrashes & abducts TV journalists from Roorkee||ROORKEE: Four journalists of local TV channels were allegedly thrashed and later abducted — two of them at gunpoint — from Manglaur near Roorkee on Wednesday evening by members of a mining syndicate when the mediapersons were attempting to film their activities. The miscreants after keeping the mediapersons hostage in their vehicle for around half an hour dumped them at Purkazi in Muzaffarnagar and fled after they were chased by police. Police officials said they have detained three persons for interrogation so far and registered a case under sections 147 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 365 (kidnapping), 392 (robbery), 504 (intentional insult) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code at Manglaur police station against half a dozen persons. According to sources, the four scribes were trying to film the activities of the mining mafia at Manglaur at about 8.30 pm when they were stopped. It is alleged that the mediapersons were brutally beaten up with lathis and belts.Two of the scribes, Salman Malik and Sandip Chaudhary managed to escape and informed police about the incident. Meanwhile, it is alleged that the two other scribes, Arshad Hussain and Prince Sharma were forcibly taken away at gunpoint in an SUV towards Muzaffarnagar. When police teams gave chase, the miscreants dumped the two scribes at Purkazi near Narsan borders and fled. "All four journalists are now safe at their respective homes. We have formed multiple teams for conducting raids on possible hideouts of the miscreants. We are expecting to make arrests in the case within the next 24 hours," said SP (rural) Pramendra Singh Dobal. Illegal mining of sand, earth material as well as gravel is a big problem in the area and goes on unabated on many rivers including Ganga, Banganga and Solani which pass through different parts of Haridwar district. The mining syndicates involved in these activities operate with such impunity that a few years ago, they had even attempted to run over with their tractors local officials from the revenue department including an official of tehsildar rank when they were challenged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mining-mafia-thrash-4-tv-journalists-abduct-2-at-gunpoint-from-manglaur-near-roorkee/articleshow/81575694.cms||Tapan Susheel

---||Ahmedabad||Pandemic boost for health infra, but a long way to go||Ahmedabad: The first thing the state government had to do after the pandemic started a year ago was to take stock of its medical infrastructure – the doctors and specialists had over 50% vacancy whereas in rural areas, the health centres were handled by even lesser staff. A year later, the vacancies are still an issue, but the health infrastructure has got a boost in terms of equipment, trained personnel and SOP in place. A senior state health department official told TOI that they had started the recruitment drive, but due to terms and conditions, the response is not very good. “It’s due to the present infrastructure that four major cities – Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot – could right away start Covid-dedicated hospitals almost immediately. Issues such as oxygen and medicines were taken care of by senior IAS officers at these facilities, whereas daily video conferencing with the district and taluka level units were taught about latest SOPs and difficult cases,” said the official, adding that the training would go a long way to ensure that the state can better tackle the next surge in the pandemic. On-ground infrastructure also included EMRI 108 ambulances – the vehicles made 10.78 lakh trips, shifting 1.35 lakh suspected Covid-19 patients. “The fleet has been increased with dedicated ambulances for the Covid-19 patients,” said a senior EMRI official. But the need of the hour is to fill up vacancies in a permanent manner and address employee issues, said a senior Ahmedabad-based doctor on condition of anonymity. “Right from DPCs to stipends, the state has witnessed multiple representations in the past one year – some have been successful, whereas for some the wait is still on,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pandemic-boost-for-health-infra-but-a-long-way-to-go/articleshow/81576923.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Big cat family of 4 missing from Ranthambore reserve||JAIPUR: Four big cats of the same family have mysteriously gone missing from Rajasthan’s Ranthambore National Park, which recently gained notoriety for poaching cases. The whereabouts of these big cats — tiger T-64 and tigress T-73 and her two sub-adult cubs — have not been traced for the past one year now. The missing of an entire family of big cats is unprecedented in the history of Rajasthan’s wildlife. Sources said the big cats had gone missing from the non-tourism zone, Dhundhar Mal Ka Durrah, and the last movement of the family was captured by a camera trap in March last year from a nearby area. Experts have not ruled out the possibility of suspected poisoning by villagers as widespread grazing in the tiger reserve continues. The forest department, however, remained tight lipped about the missing tigers. Chief conservator of forest (CCF) and field director Tikam Chand Verma said he was not aware of the missing tigers and added that he would seek information from deputy conservator of forests (DCF) Mahendra Sharma. Despite several attempts, Sharma was not available for comments. Tigress T-73 was a progeny of the famed tigress T-17 'Sundari', which also had gone missing from the same national park in 2013. In 2019 June, T-73 was captured by camera traps with three cubs. Later, it was discovered that she had given a litter of four cubs. “While two of the cubs have been spotted at a different location, two others along with T-73 tiger and T-64 are currently missing. The two cubs present in the area are also under threat,” sources said. Experts said that the grazing areas were a particular threat to big cats as it restricted movement and raised concerns of man-animal conflict. Since 2006, the park has lost 30 tigers mysteriously, including seven old and 23 young ones. Among the 23, 11 are tigresses, which do not usually venture out for marking their territories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/big-cat-family-of-4-missing-from-ranthambore-reserve/articleshow/81577881.cms||Ajay Singh

A resolution to bring Arpora-Nagoa under the jurisdiction of the Calangute police station was adopted by the gram sabha three years back and has still not been implemented, said Anna D’Mello, an Arpora resident, who raised the issue once again at a recent gram sabha of the panchayat. Earlier, the village was under the jurisdiction of Calangute police station, but it was later brought under Anjuna police station because of political pressure, D’Mello told TOI. It needs to be brought back under Calangute police station because as it is inconvenient to travel to Anjuna to lodge a complaint, she said, adding that Arpora-Nagoa is also part of Calangute constituency. Arpora-Nagoa sarpanch Rajesh Morajkar said the proposal will be discussed at the panchayat meeting on March 26. “We will be writing to the chief minister and other concerned authorities to bring Arpora-Nagoa village under the jurisdiction of Calangute police station,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/put-arpora-nagoa-under-calangute-police-station/articleshow/81577893.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Sleep disorder leads to adverse health conditions, shouldn’t be ignored: Doctors||HYDERABAD: The city is witnessing a steady rise in cases of sleep disturbance and insomnia for the past one year, say experts, on the occasion of World Sleep Day observed on March 19. This year’s theme: ‘Regular sleep, Healthy future’ that focuses on maintaining fixed timings to sleep and wake up. Multiple pulmonologists, cardiologists and general physicians that TOI spoke to said about 10 to 15 patients have been walking in to their chambers with various problems, including sleep disturbance, in recent times. “There is a lot of anxiety and sleep disorder issues being reported over the past year. The pandemic-induced anxiety and job insecurity have added to the problem,” said Dr Sai Ravi Shankar, senior consultant cardiologist, SLG Hospitals. Reiterating how insufficient or irregular sleep patterns lead to adverse health conditions, doctors said disciplined sleep hours ensure better mood, psychomotor performance and academic achievement. Sleep, they added, is involved with many physiologic systems such as memory consolidation, control of inflammation, hormone regulation, and cardiovascular regulation. “Reduced sleep can cause impairments in cognitive and executive function, while poor sleep has been associated with poor mental health,” said Dr V V Ramana Prasad, consultant pulmonologist, Kims Hospitals. “Breathing exercises, meditation, mindfulness and other practices that focus on self-management of sleep offer opportunities for further enriching our lives.” But the challenge is, sleep-associated disorders are often ignored. “Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is one condition associated with disorder that blocks the air coming inside our body, thereby reducing oxygen levels during sleep. The most common symptom of OSA is heavy snoring. The notion that snoring is a sign of healthy sleep is a myth. It may lead to serious cardiac issues, lung problems and can even cause death during sleep. There’s very little awareness among people regarding sleep apnea as only 2% patients visit a doctor,” said Dr Vishwanath Gella, director pulmonary medicine, AIG hospitals. Given the rise in cases, experts stress the need for incorporating sleep medicine in routine healthcare. “Most of the times the impact of sleep disturbances on health are ignored, both by patients and clinicians. Incorporation of sleep medicine in the healthcare delivery system can improve the quality of life in many patients and in turn improve their physical and mental health,” said Dr Raghukanth, senior consultant pulmonologist, Medicover Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sleep-disorder-leads-to-adverse-health-conditions-shouldnt-be-ignored-docs/articleshow/81577906.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Dehradun||Members of Congress protest across country over Uttarakhand CM’s ‘ripped jeans’ remark||Dehradun/Almora: Members of the opposition Congress on Thursday held protests across the state, condemning chief minister Tirath Rawat’s “ripped jeans” remark. The chief minister on Tuesday had said women clothes like ripped jeans set a bad example for children and ultimately led to degradation of the society. Former CM Harish Rawat said that “such a statement coming from a politician, let alone a chief minister, was a shameful act”. “Women in Uttarakhand have been at the forefront of all sorts of campaigns. Rather than focusing on what they choose to wear, the chief minister should focus on development. Tirath Rawat has been made the chief minister to cover up his predecessor’s failure. The replacement itself was enough to show that the BJP had admitted to its mistake. Rather than making unwarranted comments, the chief minister should focus on the responsibility he has been entrusted with,” the veteran Congress leader said. Congress state spokesperson Garima Dasauni added, “The comment is in bad taste.” Meanwhile in Almora, a group of around 20 women, led by Mahila Congress district president Lata Tiwari, raised slogans against the CM, burnt his effigy and demanded his resignation. Tiwari called the CM’s remarks “condemnable”. “In today’s society, girls are not behind boys in any field. The chief minister’s views on what is appropriate for them to wear clearly shows his mindset. It’s ironic that the remark came from the chief minister of a state ruled by BJP, a party that goes by the slogan “Beti Bachao Beti Padhao”. We demand that the CM issue an apology and resign from his post immediately.” Tiwari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/members-of-congress-protest-across-country-over-uttarakhand-cms-ripped-jeans-remark/articleshow/81575733.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Ahmedabad||One year on, Gujarat treads cautiously on pandemic path||AHMEDABAD: On March 19 last year, Gujarat announced the dreaded arrival of Covid-19 virus as a 32-year-old man from Rajkot, who had returned after a trip from Medina to Mumbai, and 21-year-old girl from Surat, who had returned from London, tested positive for coronavirus. 365 days later, cases have reached 2.82 lakh, at an average of 774 cases daily. Four days after the first case was reported, Gujarat recorded its first death – a 69-year-old man from Surat who succumbed to the infection on March 23. In 361 days, the state’s death toll has reached 4,433 at an average of 12 deaths daily. During the past year, Ahmedabad even became one of the major pandemic hotspots in the country, causing a central team to visit the city twice. With Thursday witnessing 1,276 daily cases – a 99-day high, the state is again facing a surge. The government has partially closed down public places to prevent crowding. Night curfew has also been imposed on four major cities of Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot, and Vadodara that account for over two-thirds of the daily cases. How does the second year of pandemic for the state pan out? Dr JP Modi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad, said that medical infrastructure and personnel are more prepared to tackle the pandemic. “When the pandemic started, the medical fraternity had the least idea how it would pan out for a populous country like India. As we complete a year, we are optimistic as protocols are in place. We have trained doctors and staff, and there is better awareness so mortality rate is not likely to be as high as the first two surges,” he said. But will life ever be back to ‘normal’? Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that the third surge – after the first two in September and November – could have been avoided with better caution. “After February, we have seen lax behaviour from almost all walks of life as if the pandemic has gone. How many of us make it a point to wear the mask when we are in public all the time? If we don’t want to witness lockdown-like restrictions again, we must be on our guard. The severity and mortality is less compared to the past two surges, but with the virus mutating, we are still not near the end,” he said, adding that AHNA is again starting its helpline and home care services. The citizens of Ahmedabad witnessed ‘curfew’ after a long time. During the lockdowns, the queues for daily essentials were long, and travel restrictions quite frustrating. The pandemic messed with the psyche of several citizens, causing rise in domestic feud and depression. Experts hope that one does not have to endure the phase again. “Most importantly, we have realised the importance of public health, surveillance for pandemic, and cleanliness. Good habits must continue,” said Dr Dileep Mavalankar, director of IIPH Gandhinagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/one-year-on-gujarat-treads-cautiously-on-pandemic-path/articleshow/81576938.cms||Parth Shastri

While BJP has turned the polls into a testing ground, having fielded its candidate in this constituency for the first time against Congress’ Pratima Coutinho, the outcome of the election will determine the measure of strength of the Congress bulwark in its traditional fortress. While Coutinho has publicly made known her larger political ambitions – she was reluctant to contest the ZP polls as she had set her sights on the assembly seat - BJP candidate for the Navelim bypoll, Satyavijay Naik, is also likely to be a strong claimant for the BJP ticket for the 2022 assembly elections from Navelim constituency. AAP, after its victory in Benaulim, is going all out for a victory in Navelim where it has fielded Matilda D’Silva. That both Congress and BJP have turned the contest into a battle royale is evident from the fact that top leaders of both the parties have descended on the battleground to campaign for their respective candidates. While chief minister Pramod Sawant, deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar, and BJP state president Sadanand Tanavade addressed campaign meetings in Navelim, Congress brass including leader of opposition Digambar Kamat, state Congress president Girish Chodankar, and Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro shared the dais at the party’s campaign meetings. While BJP has based its campaign on the propaganda that “BJP-ruled Centre, BJP-ruled state and BJP-ruled ZP” would fast-track development in the constituency, Congress is aiming to “teach BJP a lesson for its high-handed governance” with a victory in the March 20 ZP polls. With the Davorlim ZP seat, a part of the Navelim assembly constituency, already under its belt, a victory for BJP in the Navelim ZP constituency, will bolster its prospects for the assembly polls in Navelim.

The committee has asked the budget division to take necessary action in providing an additional Rs 485 crore to the institute. The committee’s report on demands for grants was tabled in the ongoing parliamentary session recently. The report stated that the institute demanded Rs 2,150 crore for the financial year 2020-21, but was granted only Rs 1,426.53 crore, which was less than that of 2019-20. The parliamentary standing committee directed PGIMER to inform it regarding the allocation of additional fund of Rs 485 crore under the supplementary demand at revised estimate (RE) stage 2020-21 as put forth by PGIMER, Chandigarh.The committee observed that in the past years, PGIMER has been successful in utilizing the maximum of the budget allocated to it. The committee said it was unable to comprehend the reason for the lower allocation of budget. It said shortage of funds should not affect the services at PGIMER, which was the leading tertiary care hospital of the region and catered to patients from all over Punjab, J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana. The committee, recommending higher grant, reasoned that PGI has absorption and utilisation capacity of the allocated money and the ministry of finance must have given it to the institute as per the projected demand. Money matters The institute’s demand was of Rs 2,150 crore under budget estimate for the financial year 2020-21 and was forwarded to the budget division.

Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) remains a hotspot, after Mumbai, since July last year, beating Thane and Navi Mumbai. The past 18 days have seen 5,440 new patients in KDMC—an 80% increase compared with 3,025 cases in February. Health officials said while cities such as Ulhasnagar and Bhiwandi have managed to keep cases under check, Dombivli and Kalyan have a huge floating population that travels to Mumbai for work by local trains. The civic administration has increased testing by 2,400 daily. The death rate has remained low at 1.7%. On Thursday, 565 new patients and one death was reported in KDMC. Cases now total 68,737, including 1,222 deaths. Active patients totalled 3,926 as on Thursday. Rural Palghar has witnessed a 78% surge in March at 411. In February (231 cases) and January (331), cases ranged between 30-38%. Tribal students and teachers residing in hostels have contributed to the rise in cases. Thane city remains in the number two position after Kalyan-Dombivli with a 31% spike in cases in the two weeks of March (4,222 cases). Between January and February, the rise in cases was restricted to 8%. Not following safety protocols, especially by those in the 31-40 age group, has contributed to the spike, say civic officers. Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) mayor Naresh Mhaske warned of stern action against individuals and commercial establishments flouting Covid rules.

---||Mumbai||Lateral-entry engg 3rd, 4th sems in 5 months in Mumbai||Mumbai: Students who took lateral entry into second-year engineering courses across the state this year are expected to complete their third and fourth semesters together in less than five months. Around 50,000 such students are forced to attend lectures for both semesters, which in some colleges run up to seven hours a day, when their classmates have to cover only one. The pandemic has had a severe impact on these students whose admissions concluded only in January when most colleges had completed exams for the third semester. “Prolonged lecture hours are making it difficult for us to find time for self-study or even our projects,” said an affected student. In Mumbai University, the third semester syllabus for these students has been cut by 20%, said a principal. Their third semester exams will be scheduled in April and the fourth in June, but there is no clarity from the university on the schedule. “Despite the reduction in syllabus, it is unfair for us to compete with students from our class who have the burden of only one semester. We are expected to study for 12 subjects in under five months,” said a student. Another said they don’t have time to study for internal assessment as they are flooded with assignments. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/lateral-entry-engg-3rd-4th-sems-in-5-months-in-mumbai/articleshow/81575759.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||India||SC saves Army the blushes, stops Maj Gen from being sent to jail||NEW DELHI: Averting a major embarrassment for the Army, the Supreme Court on Thursday stayed a Telangana court order sending Maj Gen R K Singh, General Officer Commanding of Telangana Andhra Sub Area, to two months in civil prison for alleged disobeying a court decree in a land dispute case that has seen litigation between the military and civilians for over 50 years. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a three-judge bench headed by CJI S A Bobde that it was unthinkable for an Army GOC to be sent to jail over a civil litigation. The bench immediately stayed operation of the trial court order in execution of decree proceedings. The Telangana HC had refused to stay the order sending the GOC and the defence estate officer to two months in civil prison for not honouring the decree. The case has a chequered history as the land, on which the TASA establishment is set up, was acquired initially by the Nizam of Hyderabad for military purposes over 100 years ago. The defence establishment had filed a civil suit in 1971 claiming ownership over 9 acres of land, which it claimed was encroached upon by civilians. The 1971 suit sought removal of encroachment over the 9 acres used for parade and training purposes by the TASA set-up. The Army had produced a Survey of India map of 1900 to substantiate its claim over the land and said it was regularly leased out every year by military authorities for grazing. The civilian defendants claimed ownership over the land through adverse possession for over 160 years and argued that the continuous adverse possession by them for more than one and a half centuries had completely extinguished the ownership rights of the cantonment over the said piece of land. A civil court in Secunderabad had dismissed the suit filed by the Army. The HC upheld the dismissal. With Army authorities continuing to claim ownership over the land, the defendants moved the trial court again for execution of the decree. The trial court by its January 27 order said the GOC and the defence estate officer be sent to civil prison for two months each for their wilful disobedience and violation of the decree of permanent injunction passed by the court on December 11, 2017. The GOC and estate officer were also directed to make good the damages done by them to the decree scheduled property and restore the same by erecting fence and gate within a period of one month, failing with the decree holders could do the same and recover cost from Army authorities. The Telangana HC had on March 9 simply adjourned hearing on the appeal filed by the Union government without staying the trial court order. This forced the Centre to move the SC to avert the GOC and estate officer from being taken to civil prison.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-saves-army-the-blushes-stops-maj-gen-from-being-sent-to-jail/articleshow/81579620.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The CM said, “Fears of a new lockdown in the state are misplaced. In the past too, when the government relaxed the lockdown, we had made it clear there will be no lockdown, but the government will adopt other measures for Covid-19 control.” He added that Covid-19 cases are not increasing in Gujarat alone, but across the country. “The PM has expressed concerns about the growing number of cases and has given us necessary guidance in the video conference yesterday. The state government is taking strong measures to control spread of the virus,” the CM said on Thursday. He added, “At the core group meeting, I have directed to increase the vaccination target to 3 lakh per day, which is twice the present capacity. We have increased RT-PCR testing and set a target of 60,000 tests per day.” Appealing to the people to be extra cautious, the CM said, “Earlier the government got lot of cooperation from the masses to curb the spread of Covid-19 and again we expect the same cooperation. In February, when the number of Covid-19 cases dropped, people started taking things,” Rupani said. “There was laxity in following the rules. I appeal to people to strictly follow mask and social distancing rules. I have directed the home and health departments to take strict measures,” he said. The CM said, “We made arrangements for 5,000 beds for Covid-19 patients. The process of reserving beds in private hospitals is ongoing. Citizens should not panic, but take necessary precautions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fresh-lockdown-not-being-considered-says-cm-rupani/articleshow/81576957.cms||---

Kingpin Muntiyaz Shaikh, a Powai resident and an auto driver, and associate Khushnoor Khan (37) were caught on March 16 when they came to take an auto parked outside an international school in Dindoshi (E). Khan used a starter plug that he carried along, which he connected to the stolen auto, after breaking the company-fitted seal to steal it. Shaikh used the auto to travel to Andheri (E) to steal the auto on March 13 belonging to Pappu Jaiswal (37), who resides near Marol Metro. Jaiswal lodged a theft complaint the next day after he failed to locate his auto. During the probe, police found out through Shaikh’s WhatsApp chat with his aide that they had stolen more than 75 autos from Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane. They were never caught as Shaikh uses to change the stolen autos’ registration, engine and chassis numbers with those of genuine one of those vehicles seized by a finance company for loan default. “Shaikh has purchased some autos that were kept for auction by the financial company, seized from loan defaulters. He gained the trust of the recovery agent, from whom he got hold of the defaulters’ vehicle database that he used on the stolen vehicles,” DCP (zone X) Maheshwar Reddy told TOI. The theft was noticed after Andheri police senior inspector Vijay Belge, inspector Shivaji Pawade, sub-inspector Digamber Pagar and detection staff scanned through CCTV footage, after Jaiswal’s complaint, and mobile call data records (CDR) from the location helped identify the accused. “Shaikh travelled in a stolen auto, for stealing Jaiswal’s auto, with a registration number that belonged to a person in whose name the vehicle was registered but was seized due to a loan default. We sought Shaikh’s bank details to know the amount he has earned from renting out stolen autos,” police said. Belge said they seized at least 40 autos worth over Rs 78 lakh that Shaikh and his associate have stolen since 2019. “Shaikh used to take the autos to a garage at Sasupada in Vasai, Palghar, where he uses to remove engine and chassis numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai61-year-old-powai-man-his-aide-steal-over-75-autos-rent-them-out-for-lakhs/articleshow/81576973.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Pune||Staying indoors brings troubles for some patients||Pune: Home quarantine is proving to be a worrying experience for some Covid-19 positive patients due to non-cooperation from their housing societies. Displaying the names of positive patients on common notice boards in the societies and demands for health reports from infected patients is leading to disputes with the executive committee members at some societies. “I tested positive for Covid-19 22 days ago. My name was put up on a notice board at the society gate. On testing negative, I informed the security guards accordingly and told them to erase my name,” said a resident of Undri, who is a single mother to two children. She said that the harassment by the so-called office bearers was such that she would receive emails from the secretary of her society reminding her of the infection. Visitors to the family were refused entry since there was a positive case on the premises. “I called the civic body and asked whether it compulsory to submit physical/hard copy of the negative test reports and they said it’s not so,” she said. Officials of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had said that office-bearers of housing societies in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad would be roped in to track Covid-19 patients under home quarantine. As part of the protocol, stickers are pasted on doors of home-quarantined patients and sign boards are placed at the gates. However, activists have said that the civic bodies ought to ensure the society office-bearers do not commit excesses by imposing unreasonable rules in the name of monitoring those under home quarantine. “The PMC has appealed to office-bearers of societies to monitor the patients. The initiative is intended for better coordination in Covid-19 management,” said a senior PMC official, who added that PMC had received no complaint about harassment of those under home quarantine. Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch said that a balance should be maintained between Covid protocol and monitoring patients. “The positive patients must adhere to guidelines while executive committee members should not use excessive power under the garb of keeping a watch,” he said. Vaishali Patkar, a city-based social activist, said that the situation should be handled amicably. “The pandemic has created many issues. It is leading to problems at personal and social level. They should be resolved in a friendly manner within the society,” she said. Despite repeated attempts, PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar remained unavailable for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/staying-indoors-brings-troubles-for-some-patients/articleshow/81576968.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: No night curfew; more challans, tracing||CHANDIGARH: While the Punjab government has extended night curfew in nine districts by two hours, the Chandigarh administration on Thursday decided not to impose it. The decision was taken in a review meeting chaired by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, who directed that testing, particularly RT-PCR, should be enhanced. He advised the hospital authorities to ensure that patients going for OPD consultation get themselves tested for Covid either from government or private facilities to check the spread of virus on hospital premises and prevent risk to health workers and other patients. The administrator directed municipal corporation (MC) commissioner to intensify contact tracing and enhance sanitization in the city. He asked the police to intensify challaning of those not wearing masks in crowded places, including markets. He appealed to the shopkeepers to get themselves and their staff voluntarily tested and display a signboard in front of their shops, stating that they were free from coronavirus. The administrator advised the owners of restaurants and other eating places to reduce the number of tables and ensure social distancing. UT adviser Manoj Parida said the administration was reviewing the situation on a regular basis and were in touch with health experts. At present, there was no need to impose night curfew in the city, he said. ‘Many young patients affected’In the meeting, PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said they have 108 Covid patients in Nehru Hospital Extension, out of which 29 belong to Chandigarh, 49 to Punjab, 19 to Haryana, eight to Himachal Pradesh and three to other states. The director said there has been 6% positivity in the samples collected by PGIMER. Another PGI doctor said many young patients have been affected in the recent surge with severe infection and a large number of them were from rural areas. Dr Minni of PGIMER clarified that reports on samples, which were sent for genome testing to Pune, showed that they contain the same corona strain as before.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-night-curfew-mask-challans-contact-tracing-to-be-intensified/articleshow/81576961.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||India||Murder case comes alive after 16 years, ‘dead’ convict held||MEERUT: For 16 years, Alok Singh had led an inconspicuous life as a security guard at Rudrapur in Uttarakhand. But two months ago, suddenly, his wife “disappeared” and he left for Bulandshahr, looking for work. On Wednesday, when the 55-year-old out on an errand was surrounded by police, handcuffed and taken away. Alok was in reality Aniraj Singh, a murder convict who had staged his own death in the infamous Meerut fire of 2006 and been on the run since. The bloody trail goes back to Sardhana in 1986. “That year, his father had been killed in a village rivalry,” said Sudhir Tyagi, in-charge of the SWAT team that arrested him on Wednesday. “In 1988, he murdered his father’s killer.” He was 22 then. When he stood trial in a district court, he was let go. Then, the prosecution approached the high court. As the case dragged on, Aniraj went in and out of jail on bail. “But in 2004, the Supreme Court upheld the high court verdict (on his life term). This time, Aniraj evaded arrest and went into hiding,” Tyagi added. “He was declared an absconder. In March 2006, a reward of Rs 20,000 was announced for information on his whereabouts,” said Sardhana SHO Brijesh Singh. A month later, a huge fire broke out at Victoria Park in Meerut. More than 60 people died. “Many of the bodies had been charred beyond recognition,” Singh said. Aniraj saw his chance. Days later, Aniraj’s family came up with a death certificate — Aniraj had died in the fire, they said. And the file was shut. Aniraj, meanwhile, forged documents to take on a new identity, Alok Singh. He was 39 then. He moved to Rudrapur, got himself a job as a factory guard. In early January this year, after a tip-off, UP Police arrested his wife and charged her with cheating and forgery. He was on the run again. “We got information that he had been seen at Syana in Bulandshahr,” said Singh. “This time, we finally got him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/murder-case-comes-alive-after-16-years-dead-convict-held/articleshow/81579617.cms||Sandeep Rai

The boy has been admitted to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) with injuries to his neck. A forest official identified the injured boy as S Eswaran, son of Sathish Mani- Chandrika couple of Sholayar Estate near Valparai. “While he is a Class VI student of a government middle school located on the tea estate premises, his parents are working with a hotel in Valparai.” The officer said the incident occurred when Eswaran and other children were playing near the tea estate around 5.30pm on the day. “They did not notice the leopard, which suddenly pounced on Eswaran and tried to drag him away. He suffered injuries to his neck. When other children raised an alarm, tea estate workers reached the spot and chased the leopard away.” They also took the boy to a hospital at the estate, where he was provided first aid. Later, the boy was taken to the government hospital in Pollachi, from where doctors referred him to the CMCH.

---||Ahmedabad||70% of children now delaying sleep by 60-90 minutes: Survey||Ahmedabad: The popular adage ‘early to bed, early to rise’ seems to have gone for a toss during the Covid-19 pandemic as sleep patterns for school students have drastically changed during this period, a recent survey points out. Compared to pre-pandemic days, about 70% of children delay their sleep by 60-90 minutes now, leading to many sleep-related problems that affect their routine life, according to survey analysis. Due to non-physical schooling, fewer physical activities, and extended screen times, the sleep timings of children have seen severe disruption, the survey says. The survey which comes ahead of ‘World Sleep Day’ on March 19 was carried out by four schools in Ahmedabad to analyze sleep patterns and insomnia related issues among the children. Close to 4,000 parents participated in the survey exercise done by Udgam School for Children (USFC), Zebar School for Children (ZSFC), Satellite School for Children (SSFC) and Bodakdev School for Children (BSFC). About 8,000 parents were invited to participate in the survey exercise of which 50% of parents responded to various questions related to their children’s sleep. According to the survey, 60% of children use mobiles/gadgets before going to sleep. Children prefer to watch videos, play games, chat with friends for time pass at night. The average screen time has shot up by 300% compared to the last year. 45% of children prefer to eat or drink something before going to sleep. Such a behavioural change has triggered sleep disorders. However, some other notable things also emerged in the findings. About 45% of respondents opined that they follow bedtime rituals like praying and chanting mantras with their children to get a good sleep. Young children have disturbed sleep due to nightmares. Almost 35% of children experience nightmares, and 30% wake up in the middle of the night due to nightmares, the survey found. “The revelations of the survey are a bit unusual and need attention from the society at large. Sleep is an essential element for a healthy and happy life...we are more focusing on off-line activities, lesser screen time, stress-free study and joyful educational experiences for the students so that they can get a night of sound sleep and be healthy,” said Manan Choksi, executive director, Udgam School For Children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/70-of-children-now-delaying-sleep-by-60-90-minutes-survey/articleshow/81576993.cms||---

The civic body has allowed rebates in the first two months of the new financial year, from April 1 to May 31, after which it will impose a hefty penalty of 25% over the entire amount and 12% interest over it for those who fail to pay the tax till the stipulated rebate period. The cash payment will be allowed till May 31 for rebate, but for cheque and demand draft (DD), residents will have to deposit these by May 26.“We will issue a public notice in this regard in a day or two. This is a golden opportunity for the taxpayers. We are hopeful that maximum residents will make the payment in this period to avoid penalty,” sources said.The municipal corporation (MC) has already started sending property tax related bills to the owners of both commercial and residential properties. “Since we have tied up with the postal department for sending these, over 90% bills will be delivered by them and the rest 10% by the civic body as some properties don’t have owners’ names due to multiple reasons,” sources said.The ongoing current financial year will end on March 31, and to date, the civic body has received over Rs 56.85 crore in property tax, which is over Rs 8 crore more than the target of Rs 48 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rebate-on-property-tax-if-paid-in-first-two-months-of-fiscal/articleshow/81576975.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Goa||Tough fight in Bicholim as 68 candidates battle for 14 seats||BICHOLIM: The Bicholim Municipal Council (BMC) will witness a multi-cornered contest for the Bicholim municipal council, with as many as 68 candidates vying to be part of the 14-member municipal body. Following the redrawing of wards, the number of wards has been increased to 14 from the earlier 12. BJP has fielded candidates in all the 14 wards, while Together for Bicholim - belonging to former Bicholim MLA Naresh Sawal - has fielded 12. Similarly, the Bicholim Vision panel, which is supported by ophthalmologist Dr Chandrakant Shetye and former Latambarcem ZP member Sanjay Shetye has fielded candidates in 12 wards. In addition, Bicholim taluka Vikas Parishad, which is supported by Goa Suraksha Manch (of former RSS chief Subhash Velingkar), is fighting in six wards, Congress is supporting six candidates, while there are 18 candidates contesting as independents. Interestingly, five of the 68 candidates own catering businesses and are hopeful that the goodwill they have among the people will hold them in good stead during the election. Also, 13 candidates are the former councillors, of which two are wives of former councillors. Political observers opine that the role of Bicholim MLA Rajesh Patnekar, who is speaker of the legislative assembly, is of crucial importance for the ruling party. Sources say that while Patnekar is not openly seen campaigning due enforcement of the code of conduct, however, he is subtly supporting candidates of the BJP-backed panel. In comparison, chief minister Pramod Sawant is solidly backing the BJP panel by participating in corner meetings. Analysts say that given the present scenario, the contest could be very close in many wards. A few of the sitting councillors could also face a tough fight. Initially, it appeared that the BJP-supported panel would easily be able to hold sway over the town, however, although the opposition is not united, a determined bid is being made to fight the saffron force. For some it is a matter of personal interest to defeat the BJP-supported candidates, mainly due to the interference of BJP’s organising secretry Satish Dhond in some wards. In BMC’s last term, 10 of the 12 councillors of the ruling council were from the BJP-backed panel. Satish alias Rajaram Gaonkar’s uninterrupted run as chairperson brought about stability to the council. However, there were five deputy chairpersons, with Ajit Birje, Chaitanya Teli, Gurudatt Pal, Vijaykumar Natekar and Kundan Falari holding the post for one year, following a mutual understanding. Gaonkar said that the major works undertaken by BMC over the past five years and that the “BMC had not burdened the people by increasing taxes”. Among the major demands by citizens are the construction and completion of the sewage treatment plant, setting up of a Ravindra Bhavan with an auditorium in Bicholim, and periodical cleaning and covering of gutters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tough-fight-in-bicholim-as-68-candidates-battle-for-14-seats/articleshow/81578003.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Right of states to identify SEBCs intact: Centre||New Delhi: As the Supreme Court is examining the validity of Maratha reservation along with the 102nd constitutional amendment for allegedly taking away the power of state governments to identify socially and educationally backward classes for granting reservation, the Centre told the court that the amendment has not altered any arrangement and states will continue to have the power to decide SEBCs. In an affidavit, the ministry of social justice and empowerment dispelled the impression of many state governments which had alleged that the 102nd amendment is unconstitutional as it was against the federal structure. It said the power to identify SEBCs lies with Parliament only with reference to the central list and states can have a separate lists of SEBCs for reservation. “It is evident that the power to identify and specify the SEBCs lies with Parliament only with reference to the central list of SEBCs. The state governments may have their separate state list of SEBCs for the purpose of providing reservation in recruitment to state government services or admission in state government’s educational institutions. The castes/communities included in such state lists of SEBCs may differ from the caste/communities included in the central list of SEBCs. It is submitted that the inclusion or exclusion of any caste or community in the state list of SEBCs is the subject of the state concerned and the Government of India has no role in the matter,” the affidavit said. The government filed its response on a petition challenging the validity of the Tamil Nadu law granting reservation beyond the 50% ceiling fixed by the SC. The Centre is likely to take the same stand before the constitution bench as attorney general K K Venugopal on Thursday relied on an affidavit to emphasise that there was no illegality in the 102nd amendment and apprehension of state governments was misplaced. The constitution bench of the apex court had earlier agreed to examine the validity of the 102nd amendment along with Maratha reservation after some state governments had insisted that both issues be examined together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/right-of-states-to-identify-sebcs-intact-centre/articleshow/81576983.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana govt treads on popular path, sticks to agri & welfare plans||HYDERABAD: Despite being hit hard by a pandemic-induced economic slowdown, the Telangana government proposed an ambitious outlay of Rs 2,30,825 crore in the 2021-22 budget presented on Thursday with a slew of allocations for various welfare schemes.  It was for the first time that the total budget outlay crossed Rs 2 lakh crore after the formation of the state. The outlay this year was Rs 48,000 crore more than what was proposed in 2019-20 (Rs 1.87 lakh crore). While keeping the focus on panchayat raj and rural development (Rs 29,271 crore), agriculture (Rs 25,000 crore), irrigation (Rs 16,391 crore) and social security pensions, finance minister T Harish Rao also announced a new scheme for SC welfare, “CM Dalit Empowerment Programme”, with an allocation of Rs 1,000 crore, an outlay of Rs 4,000 crore for school infrastructure and Rs 2,000 crore for improvement of digital facilities in schools. And at a time when opposition parties are raising questions over delivering on past promises, the ruling TRS regime chose to continue with its schemes and made provisions for all the flagship initiatives such as Rythu Bandhu, farm loan waiver schemes, Rythu Bhima, Aasara pension and Kalyana Lakshmi scheme in the budget. Crop loan waiver scheme got Rs 5,225 crore, while Rs 11,728 crore was earmarked for ‘Aasara’(social security) pension. The budget allocation for all other schemes in the previous year was maintained, but the promise of unemployment allowance did not find a place, upsetting the opposition. The government will also provide Rs 500 crore every year to mandal parishads and zilla parishads for development work, while Rs 500 crore was earmarked for model vegetable and non-veg (meat, poultry) markets in every city. Stressing that in the past seven years Telangana has surpassed states having 70 years of history, finance minister Harish Rao proposed that revenue expenditure for this budget would be Rs 1,69,383 crore and capital expenditure would stand at Rs 29,046.77 crore. Hoping for a bounce-back of the economy, the revenue surplus in the budget is estimated at Rs 6,743 crore and the estimated fiscal deficit is Rs 45,509 crore. “This would mean that the state will have less need for additional loans, but it would happen only if income expected is realised. In the current financial year, the state had a dent of Rs 50,000 crore. The state government must be hoping that the real estate economy generates more money into the market. The state may be looking for additional income sources,” Dr Krishna Reddy Chittedi, assistant professor, School of Economics at the University of Hyderabad, said. Interestingly, there is no mention of sale of land to raise funds in the budget like the previous year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-treads-on-popular-path-sticks-to-agri-welfare-plans/articleshow/81578022.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

From Friday, curfew will be imposed from 9pm to 6am and malls and cinema halls are to remain closed on Saturdays and Sundays. Rajiv Kumar Gupta, additional chief secretary (forests and environment), who is in charge of Covid management in Ahmedabad, said that after reviewing the situation in Ahmedabad city, it was decided to close the malls and cinema halls on Saturdays and Sundays and lengthen the curfew by one hour, starting from 9pm instead of 10pm. The AMC meeting chaired by Gupta also reviewed the preparedness in the city including availability of beds at Covid designated private hospitals. Not just parks and gardens, amusement parks and clubs in the city such as Rajpath and Karnavati have also announced closure and with activities permitted since Thursday. Late at night, these clubs sent messages to their members announcing the closure. The message read, “We are closing all activities of the club as per instructions from government authorities. Sorry for the inconvenience as the message is very late but we got instructions just now to close the club.” Club authorities said even the use of gardens at the clubs will also be stopped. If there are wedding functions, the organiser will have to follow government protocol and restrict the number of guests. “We will give them the option to cancel if they want,” said a club office bearer. Students and commuters were left in the lurch on Thursday, as they had to pay more for rickshaws or risk using shared rickshaws. The situation of those travelling from other parts of the country was unenviable. “As we got off at Ahmedabad station, the rickshaw drivers were charging exorbitantly high. We usually pay Rs 200 to go to Motera, but today rickshaw drivers were asking for Rs 350,” said Rajnish Sharma, who was returning from a wedding in Delhi. Even radio cabs were charging 1.5 times the usual fare. For a trip to Vastral, the usual fare is Rs 150 to Rs 160 but today it was in the Rs 230 to Rs 250 range. Parks and garden officials said the number of visitors was zero on Thursday as locks were not opened at all. Several visitors came and went back. Combined daily footfalls since the easing of the lockdown, on average, had been 2 lakh at the city’s gardens and the zoo. Law Garden and Parimal Garden were crowded on most days. The Kankaria lakefront recorded footfalls of about 10,000 on weekends and about 5,000 on weekdays. Prashant Leua, student: “I live in Modasa and travel to Gujarat University every day using ST and AMTS buses. Today the shared rickshaw was charging Rs 30 to go to Gujarat University from Gita Mandir. They usually charge Rs 10.” Priyansh Chaudhary, student: “The AMC decision to shut bus services has affected students the most as they have to use shared rickshaws or travel with friends on private vehicles. Some of my friends even had to hire exclusive rickshaws.” Vaishali Acharya, professional: “I usually travel from Shivranjani to Gujarat University in a shared rickshaw and today I realized that instead of four passengers the rickshaw driver had six and this put us at greater risk of getting infected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/curfew-to-begin-one-hour-earlier/articleshow/81576989.cms||---

Addressing a constitution bench of Justice Ashok Bhushan, Justice L Nageswara Rao, Justice S Abdul Nazeer, Justice Hemant Gupta and Justice S Ravindra Bhat on reservation for socially and educationally backward classes, including the quota for Marathas in Maharashtra, Venugoupal said it had become a regular feature of electoral politics to whip up sentiments of a particular caste or class on the eve of election by political parties by promising to include it within the ‘reserved’ category.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||CPM changing stands to fool devotees: NSS||Thiruvananthapuram: The Nair Service Society (NSS) has upped its ante against the LDF government on the Sabarimala issue with its general secretary G Sukumaran Nair talking tough on the changing stands of the CPM leadership on the issue. Referring to the contrasting views of CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on the issue, Nair on Thursday said their changing stands are aimed at fooling devotees. “The CM who had earlier said the government is committed to implement the court verdict is now saying that if the final verdict causes any sort of difficulties to devotees then it will be implemented only after holding discussions with all. However, Yechury’s stand was different,” said Nair. Speaking to reporters in New Delhi on Tuesday, Yechury had said he was not aware of the reason why minister Kadakampally Surendran expressed regret. “The party’s stance on the matter remains the same. It was the apex court which pronounced the verdict allowing women of all age to enter the temple and the state government was duty-bound to implement the verdict,” Yechury had said. Nair also slammed CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran for his statements on Sabarimala. “Kanam Rajendran has come up with the allegation that NSS organized people to blame the government after NSS had lost the case in court. It was a futile attempt by Rajendran to rescue the government. He however, is saying that NSS should wait till the final verdict. This statement itself makes it clear that the case exists,” said Nair. Recollecting the chronology of Sabarimala case and NSS’s association with it, Nair said the origin of the case in Supreme Court was in 2006. “NSS became a party to the case in 2008. The court verdict allowing women of all ages to enter the temple came on September 28, 2018. NSS had filed a review petition against this verdict before the constitutional bench on October 8, 2018. Based on that a five-member bench decided to hear the arguments in an open court on January 22, 2019, said Nair. The case was shifted to a larger bench and is still under the consideration of SC, Nair added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-changing-stands-to-fool-devotees-nss/articleshow/81575840.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

Analysts said the announcement of fitment of 29% and division of opposition votes with multiple candidates in the fray is helping TRS gain initial leads. In Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahabubnagar graduates assembly constituency TRS candidate Surabhi Vani Devi is leading with 5,553 votes against her closest opponent N Ramchander of BJP at the end of the third round. Professor K Nageshwar appears to be out of the race with poor numbers. By the end of the fourth round, TRS candidate Vani Devi had got 33.5% votes followed by BJP’s N Ramchander 30.8% and K Nageswar at 16%. In Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda graduates constituency, the fight turned out to be triangular, but TRS candidate Palla Rajeswara Reddy is leading with 18,549 votes at the end of the fifth round. Surprisingly, independent candidate Teenmar Mallanna surpassed professor Kodandaram of Telangana Jana Samithi to get the second position.By the end of fifth round, Palla Rajeswar Reddy got 30% of total valid votes followed by Teenmar Mallanna with 23% votes, Professor Kodandaram with 18%, BJP candidate Premender Reddy 11% and Congress candidate Ramulu Naik 7%. The result will not be declared soon as the second preferential vote will be counted in the elimination process on Friday. Professor K Nageshwar told TOI that in Nalgonda, it was a triangular fight. “Though TRS candidate has fair chance with second preferential vote, Teenmar Mallanna and Professor Kodandaram are still in the race,” he said. “There are two more rounds in first preferential vote. Elimination rounds will be crucial. Fitment announcement has helped TRS and the opposition vote is divided,” Professor Kodandaram said. Congress spokesperson Sravan Dasoju, meanwhile, said that with ruling TRS getting only 30 % votes it meant the remaining 70% are against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-gains-early-lead-in-mlc-vote-count-but-contest-open/articleshow/81578109.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Jodhpur||Rajasthan: Cops arrest neighbour for minor boy’s murder||JODHPUR: Police have arrested the neighbour of a minor boy who was kidnapped and later his body was found inside a sack in Polo Ground area on Wednesday morning. The boy was kidnapped for ransom but the accused killed him before placing any demand. According to police, Kishan Soni (23) had kidnapped Himanshu Prajapat (7) on Monday evening when he was playing near the house. “Soni had killed the boy in the same night, kept the body at his house the entire night and dumped it in a sack next morning in Polo Ground area in a shallow trench,” said a police official. Interestingly, the accused did not make any ransom call until Wednesday morning, just around the time the body of the boy was found by police. “Soni made a ransom call using whatsapp. So we roped in our cyber team to trace the call and get to the kidnapper,” said the official. Finally police got the number of Soni and arrested him late night. Another major lead that police obtained to get to the accused was the sack, in which the body of the minor boy was dumped. “The family of the accused was into making chapatis on order and wheat flour used to be taken home every 2-3 days in sacks,” said the officer, adding that the sack used for dumping the body was the one of those sacks. Interrogation has revealed that Soni used to work at a mobile shop, but lost his job during lockdown. He also had tried his luck in gambling, but lost money there too. Before planning the crime, he searched methods of hiding the identity in a ransom bid for 4-5 days on internet and learnt the ways of leveraging the feature of whatsapp call and escaping the eyes of CCTV cameras. Interestingly, he also remained present with the family members at the hospital during the post mortem of the kid and demonstration against police. His over-reacting also brought him on the radar of police despite being a neighbour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/cops-arrest-neighbour-for-minor-boys-murder/articleshow/81577042.cms||---

On an average, the difference between the day’s maximum and minimum temperatures in Shivajinagar had been 20°C this week. The highest temperature in Shivajinagar on Thursday was 36.9°C and the minimum was 17.9°C — a difference of 19°C. The doctors observed that amid hot days and cooler nights, cases of flu were on the rise primarily because of the change of weather and people’s habit of binging on cold aerated drinks and using air-conditioners (ACs). The doctors claimed that most of the patients coming with sore throat, cough and cold symptoms were in the age group of 20 to 40 years, and about half of them were adding the to the city’s Covid-19 caseload. Family physician Manisha Lakhani said whether it was common cold or Covid, a major line of defence was the mask. “One of the modes of transmission of the common cold or flu virus and coronavirus is air-borne droplets. So, masking is the need of the hour,” she said. Family physician Avinash Bhondwe said, “The wide variation in the city’s temperatures has been a ground for proliferation of respiratory viruses, causing an increase in cases of cough and cold. I have been getting an average of around 40 patients per day reporting symptoms like cough and cold, and half of them are getting diagnosed with Covid.” Family physician Hillary Rodrigues told TOI, “One-fourth of the patients coming to me with cough, sore throat and flu-like symptoms are turning out to be Covid positive, most of which are mild to moderate cases. Many of them are youngsters and office-goers. Common cold, cough and flu cases are on the rise not only because of a change in weather but also because of the habit among people to binge on aerated cold drinks.” Family physician Lakhani said the number of common cold and cough patients had increased at her clinic too. “A sudden change in temperature, from being in a warm environment to getting into an air-conditioned room, can make people more prone to cold and flu-like symptoms. The challenge that general physicians face now is to differentiate a common cold from Covid. Hence, a patient’s history like if s/he has been vulnerable to changes in weather and has reported similar symptoms during seasonal transition or it is a new occurrence has to be assessed. One also has to see if they have come in contact with a positive Covid patient,” said Lakhani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/huge-temperature-difference-triggers-surge-in-flu-patients-about-half-test-covid-positive/articleshow/81577052.cms||Neha Madaan

He had demanded the bribe as commission for clearing the payments of pending dues of the complainant. Senior officers of the ACB stated that serious complaints had been made against the officer Furkaan Ali Khatri for a long time. A complainant approached the ACB and narrated his plight stating that his bills for the developmental works have not been cleared and the accused has been demanding bribe. “The complainant had not received his outstanding payments for several development works carried out by him. Khatri demanded money as commission in return of releasing payments,” B L Soni, DG, ACB, told TOI. An ACB team was assigned the task of verifying the complaint. The accused had initially demanded a bribe of Rs 4 lakh out of which he had taken Rs 1 lakh at the time of verification. “He was asking 20% as commission for clearing the bills. During verification, he had already taken Rs 1 lakh and finally when he accepted Rs 3 lakh he was caught red handed by our team,” Soni added. “After the verification of the complaint, a team was sent to Sawai Madhopur, which laid the trap in which the accused was arrested,” Soni added. Senior officials stated that the complaint kept pleading for the clearance of his bills, but Khatri insisted that until his commission is not cleared he is not going to clear the bills. The accused was arrested from Sawai Madhopur and was booked under appropriate sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. “Searches at his residence in Sawai Madhopur and Kota are on,” said a senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pcf-of-wildlife-sanctuary-in-acb-net-for-accepting-bribe-of-rs-4-lakh/articleshow/81577055.cms||---

The accused were on Thursday produced before court that sent them to police custody for two days.Police said since the deceased was a hurdle in their relationship, the woman with her lover conspired to murder him and projected it to be a suicide.Budhiprakesh Meena was found dead in his house under suspicious condition on Sunday, DSP and circle officer of Etawa Vijashankar Sharma said. Since the family members of the deceased did not point out any suspicion of murder, police initially lodged a case of unnatural death under Section 174 of Cr PC and handed over the body to family members after post mortem by a medical board, he added. Later, investigation and inquiry by police revealed an illicit relation between the deceased’s wife Priyanka (30) and his neighbor Mahavir Meena (26), Sharma said.Call records of Priyanka led to her husband believe that she was in a relationship with Mahavir. This then led Meena and Priyanka to murder Mahavir.The DSP said while Budhiprakesh was asleep under heavy intoxication on Saturday night, Mahavir strangled his neck with a rope and murdered him. He added that the wife in the morning took the body inside the house and pretended to be in genuine grief over the death.Pic – the two accused in police custody on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/suicide-turns-out-to-be-murder-after-cop-probe/articleshow/81577044.cms||---

In his letter to chief electoral officer Teeka Ram Meena on Thursday, Chennithala said there are more such cases where same voter has been added more than once in the voters’ list and are holding more than one voters’ ID card. He cited the cases of Kannur (1,743 duplicate voters), Koothuparambu (2,795), Kalpetta (1,795), Thavanur (4,395), Pattambi (2,400), Chalakudy (2,063), Perumbavoor (2,286), Udumbanchola (1,168), Vaikom (1,606) and Adoor (1,283) constituencies. The opposition leader also submitted photocopies of voters list to substantiate his claims. “Our workers are working on mission mode to unearth each and every irregularity in the voters’ ID. I request you to rectify the discrepancies after examining the data enclosed at the earliest and take steps to punish the guilty,” he said. On Wednesday, the opposition leader had released the first list of bogus voters which he said was incomplete. The list included 4,506 bogus voters in Kazhakootam constituency, 4,672 in Vattiyoorkavu, 2,534 in Kollam, 1,436 in Trikaripur, 4,611 in Koyilandy, 6,171 in Nadapuram, 3,225 in Koothuparamba and 4,750 in Ambalappuzha. He alleged that in all the 140 constituencies in the state, bogus voters have been added in this manner. The election commission undertakes summary revision, updation and purification of electoral rolls in an elaborate manner. The large number of duplicate names as pointed out by the opposition leader is a serious matter of concern that can even affect the results in constituencies where the fight is close. The commission updates the electoral rolls by giving opportunity for public as well as political parties to raise their objections regarding any entries in the list when the draft list is published. The commission also runs software during the purification of rolls, to weed out duplicate entries. The chief electoral officer has asked district collectors of all these constituencies to investigate and file a report before March 20. He has also asked them to take legal action against the culprits if the charges are found true.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/oppn-identifies-over-21k-more-bogus-voters/articleshow/81575861.cms||---

The opposition parties also said that the assembly session should be adjourned and that chief minister Pramod Sawant could present the full budget a day after the polls are conducted. Sources said that Koshyari told the all-party delegation that he would discuss the issue with the authorities. Congress, GFP, MGP, NCP and independent MLA Prasad Gaonkar submitted the joint representation to Koshyari after speaker Rajesh Patnekar rejected their demand during the business advisory committee (BAC) held on Wednesday. Four of the seven members of the BAC said that presentation of the full budget with announcement of schemes and new policies would be a violation of the code of conduct for elections. “Today we met the governor and we gave him a representation and requested him and told him that while the code of conduct is in force, announcing schemes, giving grants and making announcements is not appropriate. This is unfair and not a level playing field,” opposition leader Digambar Kamat said. The opposition pointed out that the budget and the electoral process have clashed because of the government’s mismanagement. “We asked for the session to continue after the counting for the municipal council is completed,” Kamat said. GFP president Vijai Sardesai said that if the government goes ahead and presents the budget as scheduled, it would prove that the BJP is not confident of winning the polls. “The government is proving our statement that BJP cannot win any election without cheating,” he said. The GFP president also asked Koshyari if there are plans to dissolve the state legislative assembly prematurely and hold early elections in October. MGP MLA Ramakrishna Sudin Dhavalikar, who was part of the all party delegation said that chief minister Pramod Sawant does not appear well versed with administrative norms. “If one looks at the things that BJP is doing then it looks like destructive minds are at play,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oppn-meets-guv-asks-for-vote-on-account-budget/articleshow/81578136.cms||---

While citing efforts to bolster internet access and connectivity, Prasad also shared that IT sector in India has contributed 8% to the country’s GDP and two lakh new jobs have been added in the sector since 2019. “A total of 46 lakh people work in it, which include 14 lakh women. After 2019, two lakh people have got jobs in the IT sector,” he said during question hour. The plan for rural connectivity was shared in response to a supplementary question from NCP member Fauzia Khan who sought to know what the government was doing to strengthen access to online education in the remote rural areas. The minister said his focus was to keep the government schools in mind while providing digital education, so that students there are able to get the benefit of educational opportunities through the online mode. Prasad said the success of online education has been confirmed in the last one year as school education was not interrupted even during the pandemic. He also informed the House that a total of 70 lakh cases have been heard digitally by the Supreme Court and the high court during the pandemic. Highlighting the new developments in the IT sector, he said, India has become the top most performing country in the world in UPI in making digital payments. Responding to another supplementary question, Prasad said, “You will be happy to know that India has become the top country in the use of mobile applications. But we have to expand further and I'm quite sure in the coming years, Indian mobile app platforms on hosting of mobile apps will surely give a tough competition to the international platforms,” he said. The minister said that the government has started allowing Mobile Seva App Store to also host apps free of cost. “In our mobile government app, all have come on board and its total download is 8.65 crore. Therefore, it is an improvement in the right direction,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-wants-all-villages-linked-with-internet-in-1000-days/articleshow/81579752.cms||---

In Jodhpur, which is nearly always included in the list of the most polluted cities in the country, has PM10 and PM2.5 levels of pollution in the air from dust particles. Jodhpur is ranked at 35th spot in world most polluted cities 2020. The report says, “At the beginning of 2021, Jodhpur was experiencing a period of ‘moderate’ air quality with a US AQI reading of 91. The recorded level of PM2.5 was 31.2 µg/m³. With levels such as these, it is advisable to close doors and windows to prevent the ingress of dirty air. Those of a sensitive disposition, should avoid venturing outside until the air quality improves. If this is unavoidable, then a good quality mask should be worn at all times.”In Jodhpur, air pollution is mainly because of various natural and anthropogenic factors. Dust, biomass burning, industrial and vehicular pollution are the main causes. Also, this area is particularly prone to dust storms blown in from the Thar Desert,” the report says. In May 2018, three back-to-back major dust storms occurred that caused massive damage, loss of human lives, damage to property and had an impact on air quality and human health, the report recalls. Apart from pollution in the air from dust particles, the levels are also being measured in sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrous oxides (NOx). The level of pollution from sulphur, exhaust emissions are checked, but the lockdown (due to Covid ) has reduced the level of pollution in the air.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ranked-35th-in-worlds-most-polluted-city-jodhpur-prone-to-dust-storms-report/articleshow/81577065.cms||---

By adding 25,833 new infections, Maharashtra surpassed its previous record of 24,886 cases posted on September 11. Mumbai’s 2,877 new infections were more than its previous high of 2,848 cases recorded on October 10. The silver lining was that Thursday’s Covid-19 deaths in the state were one-eighth of September 11 toll, and in the city it was one-sixth of October 10 toll, but then the Mumbai Metropolitan Region crossed the grim milestone of 20,000 deaths. The state’s overall caseload is now 23,96,340 and Mumbai’s 3,52,851. In a Thursday meeting chaired by CM Uddhav Thackeray, the public health department presented a projection that at the current rate of growth, the state could have 3 lakh active cases by the first week of April (up from 1,66,353 now). Active cases have risen 114% since March 1. Till now, a total of 20,009 people have succumbed to the virus in MMR, the state’s most densely populated region, with Mumbai contributing to the maximum deaths, followed by Thane, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli.  After cities in Vidarbha and Marathwada region, the textile town of Malegaon is once again emerging as a worrying hotspot. State agriculture minister Dada Bhuse said Malegaon’s daily positivity rate is over 61%. It was one of the first pockets in Maharashtra to see a surge in cases in April-May last year.  Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that despite the surge, Mumbai is not starting at a lockdown or night curfew. “Deaths are under control. We are finding cases because we are testing nearly 24,000 people every day. We intend to double the number of daily tests; so, we expect to see cases rise further,” he said. Dr Sanjay Oak, chairman of the state’s Covid task force, told TOI, “The virus appears to be more infectious but less virulent. We are making sure that there are adequate beds for those in need.” He said people should be open to isolating in institutions rather than staying under home quarantine. The state’s daily positivity rate on Thursday was back to 21%, while Mumbai’s touched 13%.  Maharashtra’s Covid toll reached 53,138 with the addition of 58 deaths on Thursday, while Mumbai’s reached 11,559 with eight deaths. On September 11, Maharashtra’s worst day during the first peak, there were 442 deaths. Mumbai on October 10 had 48 deaths.  Thackeray has directed district authorities to ensure that all field hospitals were repaired and made ready before monsoon. “With the surge in cases, district administrations have been asked to hire health staff on contract basis and also ensure that adequate beds are available with them,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope.  In the last 24 hours, over 1.21 lakh tests were conducted across the state of which 25,833 came back positive. Over eight districts in the state have either imposed a partial lockdown for some days or have announced restrictions on movement and have shut down schools, colleges and even imposed time restrictions on shops. At the state level, Pune circle (5,583) added the highest cases while Mumbai circle reported the highest deaths (14).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/city-state-both-log-most-daily-cases-since-pandemic-began/articleshow/81579890.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Hyderabad||HC tells govt to save lakes in Hyderabad from realtors, encroachers||HYDERABAD: In a landmark order that could save Hyderabad’s dwindling lakes, the Telangana HC on Thursday asked the government to stop constructions within full tank level (FTL) of the sprawling Ameenpur lake, a biodiversity heritage site, and other lakes across the city. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, while hearing petitions seeking protection to lakes, said it was the duty of the government to protect lakes. Hyderabad is dotted with 169 big lakes, according to the government, down from more than 1,000 lakes a few decades ago. One of the petition was a PIL filed by Rajeev Khandelwal of Hyderabad Birding Pals, a society run by nature conservationists and bird watchers, who sought protection of Ameenpur lake from encroachers and steps from the state and the Centre to preserve its pristine beauty according to the true spirit of the Biological Diversity Act 2002 and in tune with past judgments. According to them, Ameenpur Lake was recognised as a biodiversity heritage site under Section 37 of the Biodiversity Act 2002 on November 21, 2016, and got the rare distinction of being the first urban lake in the entire country. C V Bhaskar Reddy, the counsel for the revenue department, urged the court to pass orders protecting this internationally renowned Ameenpur lake. A single judge had earlier passed an order, allowing road construction near it. Both revenue and irrigation departments filed appeals against this order, he said. S Sharath Kumar, the counsel for another PIL petitioner Merugu Ravi Goud from the Ameenpur area, said realtors have become very powerful these days and government counsel speaking against them was commendable. Sharath, who was also a state counsel till recently, said that GPs cannot utter a word against the realtors. “Now we are facing a threat of contempt because the court had allowed the road construction in the area,” Bhaskar Reddy said. The bench wondered why the revenue counsel was inviting orders from the court for protecting the lake and its land, pointing out that it was their duty. “Are you expecting the court to run the administration on your behalf?” the bench asked before adjourning the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-tells-govt-to-save-lakes-in-the-city-from-realtors-encroachers/articleshow/81578156.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai, Maharashtra both log most daily cases since pandemic began||MUMBAI: The state and the city smashed their previous single-day Covid-19 tallies to hit new peaks on Thursday. By adding 25,833 new infections, Maharashtra surpassed its previous record of 24,886 cases posted on September 11. Mumbai’s 2,877 new infections were more than its previous high of 2,848 cases recorded on October 10. The silver lining was that Thursday’s Covid-19 deaths in the state were one-eighth of September 11 toll, and in the city it was one-sixth of October 10 toll, but then the Mumbai Metropolitan Region crossed the grim milestone of 20,000 deaths. The state’s overall caseload is now 23,96,340 and Mumbai’s 3,52,851. In a Thursday meeting chaired by CM Uddhav Thackeray, the public health department presented a projection that at the current rate of growth, the state could have 3 lakh active cases by the first week of April (up from 1,66,353 now). Active cases have risen 114% since March 1. Till now, a total of 20,009 people have succumbed to the virus in MMR, the state’s most densely populated region, with Mumbai contributing to the maximum deaths, followed by Thane, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli.  After cities in Vidarbha and Marathwada region, the textile town of Malegaon is once again emerging as a worrying hotspot. State agriculture minister Dada Bhuse said Malegaon’s daily positivity rate is over 61%. It was one of the first pockets in Maharashtra to see a surge in cases in April-May last year.  Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that despite the surge, Mumbai is not starting at a lockdown or night curfew. “Deaths are under control. We are finding cases because we are testing nearly 24,000 people every day. We intend to double the number of daily tests; so, we expect to see cases rise further,” he said. Dr Sanjay Oak, chairman of the state’s Covid task force, told TOI, “The virus appears to be more infectious but less virulent. We are making sure that there are adequate beds for those in need.” He said people should be open to isolating in institutions rather than staying under home quarantine. The state’s daily positivity rate on Thursday was back to 21%, while Mumbai’s touched 13%.  Maharashtra’s Covid toll reached 53,138 with the addition of 58 deaths on Thursday, while Mumbai’s reached 11,559 with eight deaths. On September 11, Maharashtra’s worst day during the first peak, there were 442 deaths. Mumbai on October 10 had 48 deaths.  Thackeray has directed district authorities to ensure that all field hospitals were repaired and made ready before monsoon. “With the surge in cases, district administrations have been asked to hire health staff on contract basis and also ensure that adequate beds are available with them,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope.  In the last 24 hours, over 1.21 lakh tests were conducted across the state of which 25,833 came back positive. Over eight districts in the state have either imposed a partial lockdown for some days or have announced restrictions on movement and have shut down schools, colleges and even imposed time restrictions on shops. At the state level, Pune circle (5,583) added the highest cases while Mumbai circle reported the highest deaths (14).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/city-state-both-log-most-daily-cases-since-pandemic-began/articleshow/81578922.cms||Bhavika Jain

Music brings us together, we perform at a temple as well as gurdwara. We are all alike. Music, or any form of art, doesn’t come out of religion, it comes from our soul and experiences,” he added. They discussed Chaurasia’s autobiography ‘Breath of Gold’ penned by Sathya Saran, and the musician’s life and trysts. Coming from a family of ‘pehelwans’, Chaurasia picked the path of music at a young age. Now 82, he says his ability to adapt, learn, and re-learn made him the artist he is. Sharing a personal anecdote when he was spotted by legendary music composer Baba Allauddin Khan, who asked him to come to Maihar but the fear of his father not allowing him to take music lessons stopped him. Khan told him to find his daughter Annapurna Devi if he ever wanted to learn music. “It took me three years to convince her to teach me. I would learn from her and take lessons late at night after finishing my film recordings,” he added. He also spoke of his love for spiritual places, which inspire him to create music, and the power of meditation, which has become the most serene and quintessential element of his daily life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/music-emanates-from-soul-not-religion-pt-hariprasad/articleshow/81578161.cms||Aditi Singh

At this rate, it may take over two years to vaccinate nearly 70% of the population. Experts have estimated that 70-90% of people may need to be resistant against the virus to achieve herd immunity and for this, the pace of vaccination process must be accelerated. However, compared to neighbouring states like Tamil Nadu (1.84% received one dose of vaccine) and Karnataka (2.23%), Kerala is doing much better. The state that is leading the vaccination drive is Sikkim at 6.76%. States like Goa (4.4%), Tripura and Mizoram (both 4.17%), Rajasthan (3.75%) and Gujarat (3.49%) are a little ahead of Kerala. “In the past 60 days, around 14 lakh doses of vaccine were given in state. After initial hiccups, over the past few weeks the pace of vaccination picked up and now Kerala, on an average, vaccinates around 53,000-55,000 people each day. We need to give about 4.90 cr doses to cover 70% of the population and at this rate it will take 865 days,” said health economist Rijo M John, who has done a detailed analysis on the present Covid vaccine drive in India. He added that the vaccinated persons’ data may be two to three days old. Kerala, on an average, vaccinates only four days a week. Public health experts said that there is an urgent need to start vaccination each day and increase vaccination centres. “The faster we vaccinate before the future wave, it is better. Central government should now give permission for the sale of vaccine in open market so that people can be vaccinated at the earliest. Vaccines are absolutely safe,” said Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, lead researcher of IMA-Kochi’s national survey on post-vaccination symptoms and experiences of healthcare workers in India. Meanwhile, Kerala government is in talks with Indian Medical Association in Kerala to reach out to terminally-ill or immobile senior citizens at old age homes and residences. “A mass vaccination drive is being planned for senior citizens and those with disabilities who have difficulty in reaching the hospital. They will be vaccinated at their place of stay. With this, a large number of people aged over 60 will be covered,” said IMA secretary (Kerala) Dr Gopikumar P.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-needs-over-two-years-to-reach-70-vaccination-experts/articleshow/81575916.cms||Preetu Nair

Based on the request of state police chief Loknath Behera, government has granted permission to recruit SPC alumni members who are aged over 18 as special police officers for queue management on election day. The government has formally written to Election Commission of India seeking permission for utilizing the services of SPCs. As many as 15,730 polling booths are being set up additionally in state for upcoming elections as the number of voters permitted in one booth is only 1,000 due to Covid regulations, which would take the total number of polling booths in the state to 40,771. Cadets, who have successfully completed SPC training programme, will be roped in for the task. SPC cadets are chosen as they are trained for two years and are familiar with the functioning of police and community policing works. SPC scheme envisages a two-year programme for student cadets that combines both indoor and outdoor training programmes. SPC is a school-based initiative of the state police, implemented jointly by home and education departments and supported by transport, forest, excise and LSG departments. By April 2020, 702 schools under 19 police districts, with a combined strength of 60,000 cadets and 1,404 community police officers (CPOs are teachers trained as school-level police officers), are part of the project. The state has 34,000 regular policemen available for election duty. The police are tasked with the additional law and order management during elections, in addition to the regular deployment in booths along with central armed police force. Preparations for security deployment plan are underway and it will detail the critical, vulnerable and sensitive booths and hamlets in each district. It will be prepared jointly by the collector and district police chief. Also, for Kannur, Kozhikode rural, Wayanad, Malappuram and Palakkad, categorized as Left wing extremism (LWE)-affected districts, additional security plans will be prepared. Police have already identified LWE-affected polling booths in these districts. Once the final plan is prepared, the deployment of regular police and paramilitary forces will be finalized by a state-level deployment committee. Once this is done, SPCs will be roped in to fill the remaining areas like routine queue management on the election day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-plans-to-rope-in-spcs-for-queue-mgmt/articleshow/81575937.cms||KP Saikiran

This time around, the daughters of revenue minister R B Udhayakumar and former minister and DMK deputy general secretary I Periyasamy are among those seen on the campaign trail in the southern districts. Priyadharshini, daughter of Udhayakumar, has been meeting people seeking votes for her father who is contesting from Thirumangalam. ``I have given my father to you, please ensure that he wins,’’ she said while campaigning at T Kunnanthur, Periayur, Kallikudi and Maikudi in the constituency on Thursday. ``You made my father win with a margin of 24,000 votes. He has always thought about your well-being and done his best,’’ she said. She also hugs children and takes photographs with the elderly women.In Dindigul, I Periyasamy’s daughter Indira Dwaraganathan has been going on a door-to-door campaign seeking votes for her father in Athoor constituency. Appreciating it, P Shanthi, a resident of Chinnalapatti, says they are able to voice their needs before them easily. Another face who will be seen on the streets around Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple next week will be sitting MLA P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan’s wife Margaret Thiagarajan. ``She has participated in our festivals like Pongal and is very friendly,’’ said Shenbagam of M Colony. For a change, Madurai is also seeing a different type of campaign wherein Karunanidhi, husband of Thiruparankundram’s CPM candidate K Ponnuthai, is taking time off from his profession as an auto driver to take his wife around the constituency and seek votes. ``Women’s votes play a crucial role in elections as almost all constituencies have more female voters. Yet, that female connect goes missing when the candidate is a male,’’ said G Shanmugam, a teacher who keeps tab on election trends as a hobby.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/wives-kids-hit-campaign-trail-for-leaders/articleshow/81578196.cms||---

The current 2020-21 batch had also not written their Class X board exams last year.“When students come to Class XI, they usually struggle as they come into a new system with different subjects and the syllabus is also vast compared to Class X. This time it is even more difficult to adapt for students since schools were shut for so long. We are still covering Class XI portions for students ,” said the headmaster of a government higher secondary school. Schools are hoping that some form of exams are conducted at school or district-level to motivate them to study Class XI syllabus seriously.Teachers are also worried that while usually groups are allotted for students based on the marks scored in Class X by considering the difficulty level of subjects, this year, there was more freedom given to students to choose groups of their choice. “It is not easy for students, especially those who are slow-learners to pick up suddenly in Class XI if they have taken tougher science groups. In case of practical work as well, there is a gap and it will be difficult for them again in Class XII and when they go for higher studies,” said S Shanthi, a Class XII physics teacher. While students welcomed the decision to not hold board exams this year considering the limited preparation time, they are anxious of facing Class XII. “We need some more time to learn Class XI portions also properly before starting Class XII,” said N Srividhya, a Class XI student from a private matriculation school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/challenges-galore-for-students-promoted-to-classes-x-xii/articleshow/81578239.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC asks BJP MLA to deposit Rs 5L for PIL on Covid meds||Mumbai: Bombay high court on Wednesday directed BJP Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Ashish Shelar to pay a security deposit of Rs 5 lakh within seven days after the civic body raised preliminary objections to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by him last year. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni heard Shelar’s counsel, Deepa Chavan, in support of the PIL which seeks streamlining of medicines, disinfectants and sanitisers for Covid-19 to prevent “profiteering by a few”.However, senior counsel Milind Sathe, appearing for Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said the PIL was not maintainable. The HC order said, “According to him, the petitioner’s personal interest having been affected by the impugned action of the corporation, he has sought to raise a grievance by filing this PIL.”The HC then exercised its powers under the HC PIL rules and directed Shelar to deposit the amount. It adjourned the PIL for hearing to March 31.Rule 7 (a) requires that the PIL is not for any personal gain, private motive or oblique reason. The security deposit would be toward cost if the PIL is found to be filed with private motives.At the earlier hearing, the HC had sought BMC’s reply in January saying, “The concern expressed in this PIL requires examination after the pleadings are complete.” Shelar was given time to file his rejoinder in February.The PIL said hospital acquired infection (HAI) should be checked and disinfectant procurement by public hospitals should be of the highest standards to ensure the safety of common people, particularly the economically disadvantaged sections of society. The BMC had failed to evolve a proper framework to procure medicines and disinfectants through the tendering process in conformity with applicable norms for the civic hospitals, Shelar’s counsel Chavan had submitted in January.Sathe had questioned the bona fides of the PIL, which Chavan had refuted saying as an MLA he was concerned with safety of people.Sathe also said the tendering process was a technical matter decided by experts from civic hospitals and not an issue that can be gone into in a PIL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-asks-bjp-mla-to-deposit-rs-5l-for-pil-on-covid-meds/articleshow/81577131.cms||---

As a matter of fact, home quarantine cases have increased by more than10% since the beginning of March. The region had 10,300 active cases, of which 60% patients were in home isolation on March1. As per the data released by the district health office on Thursday, the percentage of patients in home isolation is the highest in Pimpri Chinchwad where 79% of total active cases have opted for home care. In the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) areas, 72% of the active cases have preferred to stay in home isolation, while in the rural pockets, 53% patients are in home quarantine. Sources from the health department said rise in home isolation cases has helped in reducing the burden on the health infrastructure to some extent. A PMC health official said, “Though the cases are on the rise, we have noticed in the last three weeks that the patients have very mild symptoms and no complications. Those having space to isolate themselves at home have been advised home quarantine.” The PMC has issued guidelines for patients in home isolation, including stamp on the hands. Sanjeev Wavre, assistant health chief at PMC, said, “We have been appealing to the patients to complete the home isolation period diligently and avoid stepping out. Close contacts with basic symptoms should get tested,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmrs-active-count-above-30k-but-most-patients-in-home-isolation/articleshow/81577114.cms||Sarang Dastane

Earlier, FDA had written to the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) for bringing uniformity in the selling price of the drug.The FDA, Nagpur division, from Thursday started sending out appeals to private hospitals and attached pharmacies to sell Remdesivir at less than the existing rate by keeping the profit margin not more than 20%. This was done following direction from FDA commissioner Abhimanyu Kale during a video conferencing in which he briefed about the efforts the agency can take to reduce the price of Remdesivir, especially for the economically weak population and the ‘uninsured’ patients. PM Ballal, assistant commissioner (in-charge) of FDA, said the hospitals and their attached pharmacies are already selling Remdesivir below the maximum retail price (MRP) but it can be further reduced if the vendors consider reducing their profit margin and keeping it to maximum 20%. “Several hospitals have responded positively and have decided to bring down the selling price of Remdesivir. This will be in addition to the discounts that the private hospitals many times give to the patients,” he said.Dr Anup Marar, convenor of Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA), said the government authorities should cap the rates of Remdesivir if they want to regulate it like many other essential drugs, implants and stents. “Considering the ongoing crisis, government should also appeal to shops to sell all items, especially food and groceries only with 10% profit margin and not as per the MRP,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fda-urges-pvt-hospitals-to-reduce-remdesivir-price/articleshow/81575944.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Nagpur police under pressure as 236 personnel test positive||NAGPUR: The fresh spike in Covid cases in Vidarbha, especially Nagpur, seemed to have gripped even the police department. On Thursday, when the city entered fourth day of stricter restrictions imposed from March 15, as many as 236 police personnel tested positive for Covid. Out of them, 12 have been admitted to hospital. During the peak of the pandemic last year, around 1,670 cops had tested positive while 17 had died in the city while trying to enforce lockdown and perform related duties. City police have already administered first dose of Covid vaccine to 6,213 and second dose to another 480. But, seven personnel have tested positive even after taking the dose. Commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar has expressed concern over rising Covid cases among cops as the success of Covid restrictions mostly depends on the efforts taken by forces under him. Apart from the enforcements, city police are also facing stiff challenge to keep crime rate down and have undertaken special tasks of detecting past murders like Eknath Nimgade case of 2016 which had taken place several years ago. “We are sensitive about the issue and have stocked rapid antigen test kits with the office of the zonal DCPs. Almost 2,000 antigen tests are being done for early detections and precautions. The cops who are regularly exposed to the infection while on duties are being preferred for the tests,” said the top cop. “We are repeatedly urging the personnel to use masks, sanitizers and follow Covid norms,” he said adding the health of the personnel is being monitored on a regular basis. Kumar said the personnel with comorbidities are being advised office or police station duties. “We are asking them to avoid getting exposed to the infection during bandobast and such duties,” he said. Dr Sandeep Shinde, chief medical officer of the police hospital at Takli, said five medical teams have been formed for conducting tests at the police stations and other places. “The cops have been advised to take preventive medicines like Vitamic C tablets immediately and follow other guidelines,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-police-under-pressure-as-236-personnel-test-positive/articleshow/81575947.cms||Soumitra Bose

Civic officials said the eatery was not functioning at 50% capacity and many inside were not wearing masks. Ward officials were checking if eateries in the area were following Covid norms. TimesViewOne of the sectors severely crippled due to the pandemic is the food and beverages industry. Although the state allowed restaurants to reopen and operate with 50% occupancy to maintain social distancing, many seem to be brazenly flouting this rule. This is unacceptable, especially when Covid-19 cases are frighteningly increasing again in Mumbai. The recent crackdown by BMC on eateries in Worli, Bandra and Andheri over the past fortnight is timely. But diners too must behave responsibly.Around 1am they found 245 people inside, many without masks and not maintaining social distancing. Assistant municipal commissioner (D ward) Prashant Gaikwad said an FIR was filed for flouting norms and the restaurant was shut down. “Our team also levied a penalty on all not wearing masks. A show-cause notice will be served to the restaurant for cancellation of licence,” said Gaikwad. A video of the restaurant shared by BMC showed patrons flouting social distancing norms. Wearing off a mask is mandatory, social distancing should be maintained and sanitizers should be kept around.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaibmc-files-fir-against-sobo-eatery-over-covid/articleshow/81577129.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Mumbai||Vaccinate 3 lakh persons per day, directs Uddhav||Mumbai: CM Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday directed the district administrations to carry out three lakh vaccinations everyday so that the inoculation of the priority group, numbering 1.77 crore people, with both the doses can be finished in three to four months. In a meeting of state officials and members of the state task force with the CM, it was strongly advised to accelerate the drive by moving it into communities. A day before, Thackeray had urged PM Narendra Modi to allow vaccination of all above the age of 45 years irrespective of co-morbidities. The state on Wednesday carried out 2,74,037 vaccinations, the highest number of doses it has administered in a single day. Mumbai’s average remained under 40,000 for the second day in a row, after touching nearly 45,000 vaccinations early in the week. On Thursday, 39,644 people took the vaccine, including 23,599 senior citizens and 4,525 people above 45 years with comorbidities. A third of the priority group in Mumbai has finished getting at least one dose of the vaccine, said an official. The state’s vaccination tally reached 36,39,989. The Centre has approved another 134 vaccination centres for the state on Wednesday. A day after Union minister Prakash Javadekar snubbed the state over low usage of Covid-19 vaccines, Thackeray said that Maharashtra was at the second position with a total of 36.03 lakh vaccinations. While Rajasthan is in first place, it is only marginally ahead with 36.8 lakh vaccinations. Health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said the pace of vaccinations was increasing by the day. He said that the state will need around 3.5 crore doses to vaccinate 1.77 crore people from the priority groups. Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the task force who attended the CM’s meeting, said the highest need of the hour was to ramp up vaccination. “We may have to have centres within 100-200 metres from people’s homes,” hesaid. Dr Sanjay Oak, who heads the Covid task force, said vaccination has to become the top priority. “Every major hospital has to find a way to take the drive to the community. If necessary, mobile vans have to be deployed,” he said. A BMC official said that like Dharavi, more vaccination camps will be started within communities. Meanwhile, 29 private hospitals from Mumbai are still awaiting the BMC’s nod to start vaccination. Thackeray said that there should be zero wastage of the Covid-19 vaccine. There are states that have a wastage rate of 20%, while Maharashtra’s wastage is just 6%, which too should be brought to zero, said Thackeray. With the temperature soaring in many parts of the state, the district administration has been asked to ensure facilities like drinking water for recipients. “It is likely that people will avoid coming to the vaccination centres during the afternoon due to the heat, and so vaccination must be done swiftly during the morning hours and extra hours should be added in the evening,” said Thackeray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaivaccinate-3-lakh-persons-per-day-directs-uddhav/articleshow/81577142.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Kolkata||KMC, hospitals ramp up tests as number of new Covid cases rises||KOLKATA: In the wake of a slow rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has decided to scale up its testing facilities across the city. The civic brass has decided to activate its ward-level antigen tests and keep its borough-wise infrastructure ready to bring more residents under RT-PCR tests. On Thursday, Kolkata recorded 99 fresh cases while Bengal had 323 new infections, up from 303 on Wednesday. Several private hospitals, too, have seen a rise in the number of patients seeking tests. In a preliminary step, the KMC health department has decided to offer antigen tests to citizens from its 100 centres located across 144 wards. These centres had seen heavy footfall during the peak of Covid. According to a KMC health official, till September, the urban primary health centres together were conducting over 600 antigen tests. However, by December, the number came down to 100-150.  “Now that positive cases are rising slowly, we have decided to activate all our antigen test centres to reach out to people who may show some early signs of infection,” said a KMC health official. Similarly, the KMC has also decided to ramp up its RT-PCR test facility borough-wise. “We have kept our infrastructure and manpower ready for sample collection from housing complexes, markets and office buildings and we will reach to any spots on demand from the citizens for collection of samples,” said a KMC health official. On Thursday, senior health officials at Swasthya Bhawan, in a video conference with district health and administrative officials, asked the latter to be more vigilant to detect hotspots (if any), ramp up testing and to be on their toes to prevent a resurgence. They were also told to encourage people to take the vaccine. “We are ramping up testing, administering vaccines and keeping the healthcare machinery prepared. But Covid protocols are being violated widely,” said IPGMER gastroenterology head G K Dhali, who is the state coordinator of Covid-19 containment and management. Healthcare experts said that mass gathering in political rallies could act as a catalyst in the resurgence of the virus. “We hope political leaders themselves are seen with masks and ask people attending rallies to do the same and encourage them to get vaccinated,” said a senior health official. Several private hospitals have seen a spurt in the number of tests over the last two weeks. At Peerless Hospital, for instance, RT-PCR tests had slid to less than 100 a day. It is now close to 200. “Along with the number of patients, number of tests, too, are increasing. But thankfully, the positivity rate remains just 4%. However, it was lower in January,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences ,the number of tests has spiralled to 4,000 in the last one month. “It has increased sharply over the last 2-3 weeks but positivity rate remains low,” said Narayana Health zonal head (east) R Venkatesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-hospitals-ramp-up-tests-as-number-of-new-covid-cases-rises/articleshow/81576004.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra justifies top cop Parambir Singh’s transfer: 'Lapses in probe unacceptable'||MUMBAI: State home minister Anil Deshmukh said on Thursday that the transfer of Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh was “not routine” but because of “serious lapses found in the preliminary probe” into the case of recovery of explosives from a car parked outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran. “The lapses were not acceptable,” Deshmukh said at an event in the city. “They pertained to the CP’s office and his subordinates. Therefore, I and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray decided to shift him immediately for an impartial probe,” he added. Deshmukh said the probe conducted so far by the National Investigation Agency and Anti-Terrorism Squad had revealed that serious lapses were committed by the police chief’s subordinates “which cannot be pardoned.” NIA on Saturday arrested API Sachin Waze in the explosives case. Deshmukh belongs to the NCP, which had been asking the CM to act immediately against Singh in the wake of the Waze controversy while Shiv Sena was in favour of waiting for a while. Meanwhile, NIA has detained a police inspector of the crime branch in connection with Hiran’s death and questioning is going on. The home minister, who has been at the receiving end for inept handling of the Waze episode, said, “The credibility of the Maharashtra and Mumbai police is highest across the world. Unfortunately, a section of police officer has committed serious mistakes. I have given instructions to investigating agencies to take stern action against erring officials.” Deshmukh said whenever explosives are found, the NIA by and large takes over the probe, and in the present case, NIA and ATS, both highly professional agencies, are working together and will get to the real culprits. On the allegation of leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis that Thackeray had been mounting pressure on him for the reinstatement of Waze when he was CM, Deshmukh said the reinstatement of a suspended officer of the rank of assistant police inspector comes within the jurisdiction of the police commissioner. “As per the rules, a committee headed by the commissioner of police takes a decision on reinstatement of API-level officials. The committee must have considered Waze’s case and on its recommendation, he was reinstated. So far as Fadnavis’s allegations are concerned, they are politically motivated. These files are never submitted to the government. All the powers of reinstatement are with the CP and not with the home minister or CM,” Deshmukh said. Deshmukh declined to reply when asked how Fadnavis had secured the latest information on the Waze episode. Asked if the home department was being controlled by three persons, he said, “I am the home minister, I run the department in consultation with the CM, who has the final word.” During the recently concluded budget session, Fadnavis made a series of disclosures on the Waze episode, particularly the death of Mansukh Hiran, which have caused a major embarrassment for both the CM and Deshmukh.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: ‘Ripped jeans’ jibe continues to draw flak, people flood Twitter||DEHRADUN: The backlash against Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat’s statement about “shock” at a woman wearing ripped jeans continued to flood Twitter for the second consecutive day, with the hashtags #RippedJeans and #RippedJeansTwitter together amassing over 1 lakh tweets on Thursday, even as the Uttarakhand State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (USCPCR) came to the CM’s defence. Around 5pm, #rippedjeans was top trending on Twitter in India. At the time of filing the report, #RippedJeansTwitter had over 63,000 mentions while #RippedJeans had over 45,000. However, unlike Wednesday, some supporters of Rawat had also started using these hashtags on Thursday to defend his statement. Opposition party representatives led the tweet storm. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted a photo of RSS karyakartas, saying, “Oh my God!!! Their knees are showing #RippedJeansTwitter.” Rajya Sabha MP from Maharashtra, Shiv Sena’s Priyanka Chaturvedi posted a photo of herself in black frayed denim, saying, “The country’s ‘sanskriti’ & ‘sanskaar’ are impacted by men who sit and judge women and their choices. Soch badlo Mukhyamantri Rawat ji, tabhi desh badlega. #RippedJeansTwitter.” Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra, too, lashed out. Activists condemned the statement. Child climate activist Licypriya Kangujam tweeted with the #RippedJeansTwitter hashtag, as did Kavita Krishnan: “What sort of values are you giving by asking to not value a woman by her work but by her knees…” A senior journalist posted a photo of herself wearing a torn kurta, with the caption “Don’t own ripped jeans but wore ripped kurta in solidarity..." A television presenter tweeted, “Oh dear, women who wear ripped jeans are asking for it. Wow. India going back to the dark ages. We have to stop this regressive thinking now. Women can wear what they want with as many rips as they want. Period.” Reacting to the controversy on Thursday, Rashmi Tyagi Rawat, the CM’s wife, who teaches at DAV PG College in Dehradun, said that “the CM was telling children about our culture and traditions and motivating them to take pride in their Indian identity.” “If in doing so, he gave some examples to bring home his point, it should not be seen in a negative way. His comment was about modern fashion trends and this should not be constituted as disrespect for women,” she added. As the Twitter storm raged, USCPCR chairperson Usha Negi released a press statement. “Rather than picking up a few lines said by the CM in an innocent way, the media should have focused on the theme of the workshop: substance abuse,” her statement said, adding, “The CM only meant that children these days are following the western culture when they should rather be following Indian culture.” Uttarakhand BJP chief Madan Kaushik sought to “clarify” what the CM meant: “His (Rawat’s) intentions were not at all how they are being presented. He only meant to say it is important to preserve the culture of a society.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-1l-tweets-storm-twitter-on-2nd-day-of-protests-against-ripped-jeans-comment/articleshow/81575996.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Chandigarh||Covid-hit Punjab faces consistent R-value rise||CHANDIGARH: As Punjab has been hit by a barrage of Covid-19 cases, the effective reproduction rate (R-value) — an indicator of how fast Covid-19 or any other infection spreads – is on a consistent rise in recent weeks. After dropping below the crucial threshold of one, the infection rate of Covid-19 started to pick pace after the first week of February and has been rising since then. For the pandemic to come to an end, the value of R needs to remain below one for a long period. According to the calculations done by Prof Sitabhra Sinha of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Chennai, the estimated R-Value went up to 1.04 +/- 0.01 on February 17 from value of 0.94 +/- 0.04 on February 7. By February 24, the infection rate touched 1.23 +/- 0.01 and further soared to 1.34 +/- 0.01 on March 15. The current value of 1.34 means that every 100 people, who are infected, will on average pass on the infection to about 134 people. If the value continues to rise for a long time, the number of infected people will increase rapidly. The state health department data revealed that 29,579 cases have surfaced between February 1 and March 17, 657 cases a day on an average. In the last seven days alone, 11,009 cases and 194 deaths have been reported. According to the projections, Punjab is expected to touch the figure of 3,000 cases a day by end of March. The daily growth rate of cases has more than doubled in the last two weeks, much higher than the national growth rate. From 2.4% on March 4, the growth rate touched 5% on March 17. On the All-India level, the growth rate went up from 0.9% to 1.5% during the same period. Terming the prevailing situation critical, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh in the recent week has been asking people to take precautions by adopting Covid-appropriate behaviour. The experts of the central government have also held people not following safety norms and large gathering as a key reason for the resurgence of cases in Punjab. There are 13,320 active cases in Punjab, third highest in the country. With 1,52,760 patients undergoing treatment, Maharashtra has the highest number of active cases in the country followed by Kerala where 25,394 are yet to recover. Of total active cases, 7,741 asymptomatic patients or with mild symptoms are in home isolation. Jalandhar has the most number of 1,701 active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-hit-punjab-faces-consistent-r-value-rise/articleshow/81577161.cms||Vinod Kumar
---||Chandigarh||Virus test report must for foreign pilgrims||Patiala: The Rupnagar district administration has appealed international passengers, who visit Sri Anandpur Sahib and Kiratpur Sahib for the Hola Mohalla celebrations, to bring Covid-19 negative report of last 72 hours with them. These orders will remain effective from March 24 to 29. An exhibition held every year during the Hola Mohalla has also been cancelled. The administration has also decided to conduct mandatory sampling of all those pilgrims who will stay at the hotels during the celebrations. For this, hotel or inn managers will have to inform visitors and health teams. Deputy commissioner Sonali Giri said the airport authorities of the two international airports in Punjab — Mohali and Amritsar — have also been asked to keep a close watch on international visitors coming for Holla Mohalla and persuade them to undergo Covid-19 test before moving towards Sri Anandpur Sahib. The district has around 135 beds with L2 facility, but no L3 bed facility and such patients were referred to Government Rajindra Hospital in Patiala, she added. Meanwhile, 13 separate teams have been formed for dispensaries, while more health teams will carry out sampling of guests. Ropar civil surgeon Dr Davinder Kumar said, “Each health team will comprise a doctor, pharmacist and a class-four employee at the dispensary.” Loudspeakers will be installed at entry points to carry out announcements for wearing of masks and social distancing. The gathering will be more than two lakh and it is not possible to conduct sampling of all, but the health teams would carry RT-PCR of guests at hotels. Talks are on with the NGOs to provide masks and sanitisers to the pilgrims who would be found without masks”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/virus-test-report-must-for-foreign-pilgrims/articleshow/81577172.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||India||Our target is to make UP biggest economy in terms of GSDP: Yogi Adityanath||A year of intense struggle with Covid-19 pandemic has passed. I remember the day of the Janata curfew when His Excellency the President and the Vice-President spoke to me on the phone about the preparation of the state amid the deepening crisis. They were concerned about how a huge state like UP with a dense population and poor health infrastructure will cope with this epidemic. But I assured them that UP would do its best to contain and combat the virus. We formed two teams — one consisting of members of the council of ministers and the other of officials called Team-11. Everyone’s responsibility was fixed. The situation of the pandemic across the state was minutely reviewed on a daily basis and prompt action was ensured wherever and whenever needed. The condition of UP workers in other states and the problems faced by them was constantly monitored, while we also catered to the needs of the people residing in the state. I have a sense of immense spiritual satisfaction while writing today that the whole of UP remained united in this global war. Moving on the path of development, the per capita income has gone up from Rs 47,116 in 2015-16 to Rs 94,495 today. More than 40 lakh families got housing and 1.4 crore families got electricity connection in just four years. Five expressways are getting ready to accelerate development whereas defence corridors are being built to make the country self-sufficient in the field of defence production. The result of the changing environment is that UP is the first choice of investors today. It was not an easy task to rise to number two in the national ranking of the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ within four years, but we did it. Today, our government is also focusing on the ‘Ease of Living’. Our Prime Minister has dreamt of a ‘self-reliant India’. He is pursuing the goal of making the country a US $5 trillion economy and UP expresses its commitment to achieve this noble goal. As we are marching towards becoming $1 trillion economy, our target in the coming year is to become the largest economy in terms of the GSDP. The ODOP and MSME would be our growth engines to generate employment. Doubling the income of farmers is our primary target. We will extend all technological support to them and help them diversify. Area under irrigation will be increased to ensure per drop more crop. These four years have been very satisfying for me on the work front and spiritually and have literally flown in the service of the state and its people.

A plea filed in NGT had opposed the project, claiming that the proposed construction was against environmental norms. Following an earlier order, a joint committee of experts from CPCB, IIT-Delhi and Delhi Pollution Control Committee conducted an environment impact assessment (EIA) of the project and submitted a report in January recommending that the project proponent must ensure that all necessary permission or approvals were obtained and valid. “An undertaking may be submitted that no groundwater will be extracted during the construction phase. Before dewatering (if needed) during construction, NOC may be obtained from the district advisory committee on groundwater. During the construction and occupancy phase, all environmental norms and proposed mitigation measures should be strictly adhered to,” the report stated. Finding merit in the suggestions, NGT said there was also “need for maintaining adequate greenery and to mitigate the adverse impact”. DDA will be the nodal agency for coordination and compliance. The committee, which will monitor survival of transplanted trees, may also evolve a plan for measures against pollution on account of traffic and traffic congestion based on realistic data, NGT said. A carrying-capacity study has said the project isn’t expected to result in an increase in the area population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ngt-asks-joint-panel-to-monitor-work-on-tower-above-bhikaji-stn/articleshow/81577219.cms||---

Union minister of state for jal shakti Rattan Lal Kataria told Lok Sabha on Thursday during the ongoing budget session of Parliament. His reply came on a question put up by Rajasthan MP Hanuman Beniwal, who raised the issue of polluted water being discharged into the Satluj and its tributaries which was then released into canals of Rajasthan through Harike Barrage built upon the confluence of rivers Satluj and Beas in Punjab. Some of the major cities and towns in Punjab where these sewage treatment plants are being installed include Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Kapurthala, Phillaur, Phagwara and Sultanpur Lodhi. Kataria said a large number of rivers, including identified stretches of the Satluj and the Beas in Punjab, were polluted mainly due to discharge of untreated or partially-treated sewage from cities or towns and industrial effluents in their respective catchments, poor operation and maintenance of sewage or effluent treatment plants, lack of dilution and other sources of pollution.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab CM announces 2-hour extension in night curfew in 9 worst-hit districts||CHANDIGARH: With tough measures and restrictions to be announced over the next few days, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday announced a two-hour extension in night curfew in the state’s nine districts worst affected by Covid-19. The curfew will now be in place from 9pm to 5am, instead of 11pm to 5am, in the districts of Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Patiala, Mohali, Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and Ropar. All these districts have been reporting more than 100 cases daily. The announcement came as Punjab’s daily cases shot up to 2,387 with 32 deaths on Thursday. Eight deaths were reported in Hoshiarpur, six in Jalandhar, four each in Amritsar and Ludhiana, two each in Nawanshahr, Ropar and Gurdaspur and one each in Sangrur, Kapurthala, Barnala and Patiala. Jalandhar reported maximum new cases (467), followed by Ludhiana (237), Amritsar (230), Hoshiarpur (216), Mohali (214), Patiala (187) and Ropar (165). Addressing a press conference to mark the completion of four years of his government, Amarinder said the Covid-19 situation in the state was critical and he was going to be tough. With 283 Covid-19 patients in high-dependency units (on oxygen) and another 27 on ventilators, the situation was dangerous, said Capt Amarinder, urging people to go to the doctor and get themselves tested if they feel even slightly unwell. He appealed to all citizens to wear masks and maintain social distance, warning that penalties may also be enhanced if required. Meanwhile, 2,617 health workers received their first dose of Covid vaccine, taking the number of health workers vaccinated to 1,09,790.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cm-announces-2-hr-extension-in-night-curfew-in-9-worst-hit-dists/articleshow/81577189.cms||---
---||Patna||Experts: Dip in population of sparrow a matter of concern||PATNA: Experts have claimed that the house sparrow, which is the state bird of Bihar, is disappearing gradually and steadily in urban areas due to habitat loss and diminishing ecological resources for sustenance. According to birdwatchers, factors like urbanisation, replacement of ventilators with air conditioners in houses, radiation from mobile towers, pollution, use of insecticides and pesticides in farms and emission of harmful gases have led to a drastic decline in the population of sparrows. “The radiation from mobile towers hampers the birds’ reproduction process as a result of which their eggs hatch prematurely,” state coordinator of the Indian Bird Conservation Network (IBCN), Arvind Mishra, says. In 2012, the Bombay Natural History Society had launched Citizen Sparrow, an online database targeted at recording the presence and absence of house sparrows. “The database suggests that the once-omnipresent sparrows are not as common as they used to be. Their population has declined considerably. That said, the situation is not all gloom and doom. We can still take measures to revive the population of sparrows,” Arvind claims and adds that a rise in the population of sunbirds was witnessed during the Covid-induced lockdown. Tarumitra director Father Tony Pendanath lays emphasis on raising awareness among the people about the declining sparrow population. “Earlier, sparrows could be seen in all houses, but their population has dipped significantly in the last five years,” he says. Meanwhile, Tarumitra, an organization to promote ecological sensitivity, will organise a programme on Friday as part of which students from different institutes will take part in activities like painting, clay modelling, and poem recitation. A short movie on sparrows will also be screened on the occasion. The Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, commonly known as the Patna zoo, will also organise a number of events for school and college students on World Sparrow Day. Principal secretary of the environment, forest and climate change department, Dipak Kumar Singh, told this newspaper on Thursday, “Activities like pot hanging, wall graffiti, and exhibition of Madhubani paintings will be conducted and people working for the conservation of sparrows felicitated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-dip-in-population-of-sparrow-a-matter-of-concern/articleshow/81576050.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Nagpur||Nagpur Municipal Corporation adds 8k pharmacists under healthcare worker category||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Thursday added around 8,000 pharmacists under the healthcare worker (HCW) category for vaccination against Covid-19. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the pharmacists are also constantly exposed to the virus and identified as high risk group. “They would need to show an I-card issued by their association and Aadhaar number to take the jab,” he said. Nagpur District Chemist and Druggist Association secretary Hetal Thakkar said its members are facing the threat since Day 1. “We thank the administration for considering our request. A lot of members have tested positive during the pandemic. We have also requested the collector to inoculate our members residing in other parts of the district,” he said. The development comes on a day when the vaccination figures fell by nearly 40% as compared to last week in the city. NMC medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said the response was poor only at private hospitals while the government centres continued to vaccinate good number of age-appropriate groups, HCWs and frontline workers (FLWs). “But citizens seem to be preferring government centres over private ones where they are supposed to pay Rs 250 for the jab,” he said. The final tally slipped to 7,538 in the city from 8,445 on Wednesday. The number of beneficiaries inoculated at some private centres were just in single digits while many were under 50. Multiple reasons were cited for the sharp fall in number of beneficiaries at private vaccination centres. Some said their immunization staff tested positive and thus the work came to a halt. Some blamed the unseasonal rains which led to people staying indoors. A doctor from Ramdaspeth said the lockdown and rising cases were the major reasons for steady decline in turn out of beneficiaries. Dr Chilkar said the drive would get a boost from Friday as pre-registration of elderly citizens would be proactively starting at each zone level. “The commissioner has ordered to reach out to elderly and ensure early vaccination. Our teams would help them get registered at zone level. We have instructions to increase the daily vaccination as much as possible,” he said. Regarding the pharmacists, Chilkar said the CoWin app is open now and they would be added under the HCW category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-adds-8k-pharmacists-under-hcw-category/articleshow/81577191.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Chandigarh||Will move apex court if President doesn’t give assent to Punjab Bills: Amarinder||Chandigarh: Making it clear that his government was totally opposed to the Centre’s farm laws, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday urged the Union government to shed its ego and immediately scrap the legislations and bring in new laws after fresh discussions on the issue with the farmers. “We will go to the Supreme Court if the President does not given assent to the state amendment Bills”, which unfortunately the governor is still sitting on instead of forwarding them for presidential approval, even though the legislative assembly had unanimously passed the bills, with all parties voting for them. He said it was tragic that the Akalis and AAP later started playing political games on the issue. Addressing media persons on the completion of four years of his government, Capt Amarinder said he could not see any middle path to break the stalemate between the farmers and the Centre. “What’s the use of making it a prestige issue?,” he remarked, asking the Centre, “How many more farmers do you want to kill (with your adamant stand)?” On the governor still sitting on the state Bills, the chief minister asked, “Are we a democracy or not?” Punjab took a unanimous decision and the governor had no business to sit on the files, which it was his duty to forward to President for assent under Article 254 (2) of the Constitution. Meanwhile, promising to fulfil all the 2017 poll commitments before the 2022 assembly elections early next year, Amarinder said the Congress in Punjab has no rival, as neither the Akalis nor the AAP offer any competition. More than 85% manifesto promises had already been implemented, he said, adding that it was a record for any party in any state, and the previous record was held by Chandrababu Naidu in Andhra Pradesh (for 81% promises fulfilled). BOX Won’t let peace to be disturbed Taking note of the perceptible increase in drone movement from across the border since the farmers’ protests started gathering heat in October 2020, the CM declared that “as long as I am here, no Khalistani or Pakistani or any other terrorist activity will be allowed to disturb the peace of the state.” BOX Against reservation for locals Responding to a question on reservation in jobs for local youth, as recently announced by neighbouring Haryana, which has reserved 75% of jobs for locals in private sector, Amarinder said, “I believe that India is one country and too much regionalisation is not a good thing.” Pointing out that there was no state in India where Punjabis were not flourishing and doing a great job, he said, “If we start regionalising, we will suffer.” BOX First to oppose EVMs Regarding electronic voting machines (EVMs) versus paper ballots, Amarinder said he was among the first to oppose them as they can be fudged, which he had even proved to the Election Commission at one time. He pointed out that advanced countries like Japan, Sweden and the UK were not using EVMs. The issue of EVMs was raised by a section of MLAs during the budget session of the Punjab assembly. BOX Sacrilege case: Won’t interfere with SIT The chief minister said the SIT probing sacrilege cases would soon complete its investigation and he will not interfere if they decide to challan any senior police officers or politicians. This follows SIT chief IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh recently saying that the final supplementary challan in the Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura firing cases would be filed in Faridkot court soon. “The CBI had been deliberately delaying the matter but now the Punjab Police had received the files in the cases, and everything was under control,” he said. BOX Claim on drugs twisted Listing out the achievements of his government, Amarinder said his government had successfully broken the backbone of the drug supply chain, which is what he had pledged to do with Gutka Sahib in his hands. Contrary to what was being wrongly claimed in the media, he clarified that he had never said he would eliminate the drugs mafia completely. “I had clearly said – main nasheyan di lak todanga (I will break the back of drug trade),” he said. BOX Lost 15kg in 7 months In a lighter vein, Capt Amarinder said he had lost 15 kilograms in seven months and he was acting under advice from a dietician from Delhi. “I will lose another 10kgs,” he said. BOX On Mukhtiar Ansari In response to a question regarding criminal cases against gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, who is currently lodged in a Punjab jail and whose custody is sought by Uttar Pradesh, the chief minister said the matter was sub judice. But if Ansari has committed a crime in Punjab, he will have to pay the price for it, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/will-move-apex-court-if-president-doesnt-give-assent-to-punjab-bills-amarinder/articleshow/81577205.cms||---
---||Kolkata||From final sem to alumni after a yr of sitting at home||Kolkata: In March last year, Sayani Mukherjee, a third-year Presidency student, was told her university was shutting down for two weeks to curb the spread of novel coronavirus, after which she will be able to resume her classes. A year later, she is already an alumnus of the university who never got an opportunity to bid goodbyes to her teachers and friends, attend a farewell for an emotional send-off that students cherish for their whole life or click group photos with her classmates. Thousands of students in the final year of graduation and post-graduation have missed out on the last year on the campus, which holds a special place in their hearts when they start realizing that they are on the cusp of stepping out of their student life into the real world. A year after the lockdown sent everybody indoors and shut down colleges and universities, several final year students recall the past one year with a hint of sadness in their voice. “I feel completely robbed by the pandemic,” said Mukherjee. “My entire life, the memories of my last year in college would be of attending online classes only.” Shrestha Baisnab of the economics department from Jadavpur University felt the pandemic also robbed the students of the valuable exposure in the final year. “I really feel depressed when I think of the entire episode. We missed out on everything — from farewell to convocation — that are very important to students,” said Baisnab. Final semester examinations were held in October and the students could only attend online classes as all the campuses were shut. Usually, juniors organize a farewell for the outgoing batch, which is an opportunity to bid goodbyes to teachers and classmates and click the mandatory photograph of the entire batch. “Many of us are in touch on social media but the feeling isn’t the same. I was really looking forward to my farewell that never happened,” said Sangita Tibrewal, a former student of Lady Brabourne College. Many students even lost out on campus placement opportunities because either the recruiters could not hold campus interviews due to the pandemic or cancelled the appointments. “An IT company verbally confirmed my appointment just before the lockdown started but the offer letter never arrived. They conveyed to the college authorities that they were cancelling all appointments. It was such a huge setback for me,” said Snehasish Gomes, a student of a private university in New Town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/from-final-sem-to-alumni-after-a-yr-of-sitting-at-home/articleshow/81576062.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The decision was taken on March 10 after DCP (detection) crime branch, Nagpur police, sought NMC permission to file the charge sheet. Now, the GAD has submitted a proposal just for information to the NMC House which will be meeting on Friday (March 19). In 2020, Dr Gantawar was made a co-accused in two different cases, including the sensational honeytrap case, by the crime branch. Offences had been registered against him at Tehsil and Mankapur police stations. TOI had reported about the honeytrap case after an audio clip had gone viral where Dr Gantawar’s alleged aide Sahil Sayyed and another were heard conspiring to honeytrap two leading BJP leaders. The people’s representatives had earlier raised a voice against alleged malpractices by Dr Gantawar. Tehsil police had registered an offence against Sayyed, his aide and also named Dr Gantawar as co-accused. Mankapur police too had made him an accused where Sayyed and his gang were booked for creating a ruckus at a private hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/civic-chief-okays-chargesheet-against-nmc-medical-officer/articleshow/81577209.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Now, govt to keep tabs on, ratify all Mhada decisions||MUMBAI: The state housing department will vet and approve all decisions of Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority (Mhada) before they are implemented. In a circular issued early this month, the department said several decisions of Mhada on redevelopment are contrary to government policies. Mhada has 56 layouts in Mumbai where redevelopment is allowed. “The government is unaware of decisions taken by the authority. When complaints are received, the government cannot resolve them as it has no information. The Mhada decisions that contradict government policies create unrest amongst the people and malign the government’s image,” states the circular. It further pointed out that when these issues are raised in the legislature the government finds it difficult to defend such decisions. The department has further said that it wants to bring in clarity and ensure government policies and Mhada decisions on important issues are in sync. Hence, all important decisions to be taken by Mhada will need the government’s approval. Sources said Mhada’s decisions have adversely affected redevelopment of several of its layouts. “We want to bring in planning standards which are completely absent today. Mhada layouts are originally cluster development with well-laid-out amenities. Today, Mhada approves redevelopment of single buildings in the layout, thereby affecting the future redevelopment of other buildings,” said a senior bureaucrat on the condition of anonymity. Many buildings have been unable to utilise the full floor space index available for redevelopment, no sale component has been created either. “How will Mhada generate revenue for constructing houses for the economically weaker sections if it cannot raise money from its land?” asked the bureaucrat. Housing minister Jitendra Awhad said Mhada must promote cluster redevelopment as it would help develop civic infrastructure and ensure all buildings are redeveloped and not just a few that are well located within the layout. The government is unaware of decisions taken by the authority. When complaints are received, the government cannot resolve them as it has no information.

---||Pune||Vaccination crosses the 4 lakh mark in the district||Pune: The number of Covid-19 vaccine beneficiaries in the district zoomed past the four-lakh mark on Thursday. The total includes over two lakh senior citizens and those aged 45 and above with comorbidities. According to data, the Pune Municipal Corporation has vaccinated over 2 lakh beneficiaries. It's followed by the Pune rural administration that has administered jabs to 1.24 lakh beneficiaries. In Pimpri Chinchwad, around 77,000 beneficiaries have received the shots so far. The Covid vaccination drive, which opened on January 16, has gained a massive surge in pace over the last few weeks. But Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), said more can be done to improve coverage. He said the Centre must allow the region to open up more vaccination sites. He said, “We barely touched 31,000 vaccinations per day. We hit that number just once. We need to take daily coverage to at least 50,000 beneficiaries. On Thursday, we requested the Centre to allow us to rope in smaller 20-bed capacity hospitals. That move will help us immensely." Deshmukh said there are more than 200 such hospitals in the district. "If they're roped in for the vaccine drive, our number of vaccination centres will go from 150 to 350," he said. Other officials said the current pace of coverage is encouraging. “The response to the vaccination has been good. All designated hospitals are carrying out the drive,” said Manisha Naik, a senior official with the PMC. Administrators of private hospitals said limited availability of vaccines remains a concern. “Our stock of vials is down by around 25%. This is impacting overall coverage. Many other private hospitals are facing a similar problem," an employee of a leading city-based private hospital said. The staffer added that many beneficiaries were being turned away without a proper substitute date. "Hospitals still aren't sure how many vials will come their way," the staffer said. Rajesh Patil, commissioner of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation said the civic body will only increase the number of sites if there's demand. "Vaccination will soon pick up pace in the twin towns," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccination-crosses-the-4-lakh-mark-in-the-district/articleshow/81577197.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Currently, one centre is already operational and four more will be restarted,” said Rajendra Muthe, a senior PMC official. Civic officials said that the facilities will come up at Hadapsar, Kharadi, Balewadi and Yerawada. The facility at Rakshaknagar is already operational. Patients can get admitted here and complete the quarantine period of 14 days. Discharge is given once the test results come negative. Doctors visit these centres for check-ups on a regular basis. “Patients come to these centres mostly from the congested areas of the city. Non-availability of space at their homes for isolation is a major concern. So, they prefer to get isolated at the Covid care centres,” said a PMC official. He added that the number of positive cases is not very high in the congested areas, so the demand for restarting these centres is low. If slums and peth areas start having more cases, the need for increasing these facilities will arise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-restart-four-covid-care-centres-for-institutional-quarantine/articleshow/81577212.cms||---

Sources in the KMC said that though no new water contamination spot could be detected by a team of civic engineers, the civic body’s water supply department officials replaced several worn-out century-old pipes that used to supply potable water to several households in large areas of Bhowanipore. “While conducting a search for the sources of contamination, we found some water pipes in a poor condition. We decided to replace these pipelines to minimize the scope of further contamination,” said an official of KMC water supply department. Similarly, the KMC water supply department engineers decided to repair pipelines in the suspected contamination zone to ensure safe drinking water to households. Meanwhile, the KMC water supply department on Thursday decided to keep its manpower posted at the suspected contamination zone in Bhowanipore for another week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/water-contamination-kmc-replaces-pipes/articleshow/81576066.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Every party has strategists: Amarinder on Kishor||Chandigarh: Justifying the appointment of political strategist Prashant Kishor as his principal adviser, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday said that in a democracy, every leader and party has a team of strategists. He said Kishor has been working for the Congress or its allies in other states too. In reply to a question, Amarinder added, “Incidentally Kishor is in Chandigarh today.” Kishor, who had successfully planned the campaign for Punjab Congress for the last Assembly elections in 2017, held meetings with senior officers of the government on his arrival on Wednesday. He was appointed principal adviser to the chief minister on March 1. However, since Kishor has been engaged by the Mamta Banerjee-led TMC in West Bengal, his full team is expected to focus on Punjab after the West Bengal polls. “Key claims made in the last manifesto have been fulfilled. Over the next few months, Kishor will take feedback from various departments to try and work on the grey areas so that the next lot of promises that he puts across sounds convincing. Many of the welfare schemes had hit a roadblock due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said a party leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/every-party-has-strategists-amarinder-on-kishor/articleshow/81577211.cms||---

Alt Balaji refused to comment when TOI reached out to the platform. Maharashtra Cyber officials have started recording statements of heads of various OTT platforms named in the FIR and actors starring in the allegedly obscene videos. “We are currently in the process of recording statements of the management of platforms, Prime Flix and Ullu. Alt Balaji’s Ekta Kapoor will be called for her statement soon. Actor Sherlyn Chopra’s statement has already been recorded,” said special inspector general of police Yashasvi Yadav. Some of the individuals named in the FIRs have approached court seeking protection from arrest. Chopra, 38, moved Bombay HC on February 15 after the sessions court rejected her pre-arrest bail plea. She told the court, through her lawyer, that she had been a victim and that someone had uploaded videos without her permission. Earlier this month, the HC granted her interim bail. Chopra’s statement was recorded between March 15 and 18. She was asked in detail about the videographer and editor of her videos and how the content was uploaded and transmitted online. The statement took time as she was unwell, her lawyer Charanjeet Chanderpal said. “We will wait to see what orders are passed by courts in instances where individuals have approached for anticipatory bail. In instances where pre-arrest bail is rejected, we will deliberate whether arrest should be made,” said a senior Maharashtra Cyber official. The FIR was lodged in November last year for an offence under section 292 (sale of obscene material) of the Indian Penal Code along with provisions of Information Technology Act and Indecent Representation of Women Act. A retired customs and central excise officer had lodged a complaint with Maharashtra Cyber that some websites were uploading obscene content on the internet. He downloaded the videos on a pen drive and handed them over to the police as proof, post which the offence was registered. Officials said pornographic content on the internet had grown multi-fold during the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/obscenity-fir-maha-cyber-records-statements-of-ott-platform-heads-in-mumbai/articleshow/81577285.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Mumbai||Despite surge, Mumbai not staring at lockdown: BMC||MUMBAI: A total of 20,009 people have succumbed to the virus in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the state’s most densely populated zone, with Mumbai contributing to the maximum deaths, followed by Thane, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli. After cities in Vidarbha and Marathwada region, the textile town of Malegaon is once again emerging as a worrying hotspot. State agriculture minister Dada Bhuse said Malegaon’s daily positivity rate is over 61%. It was one of the first pockets in Maharashtra to see a surge in cases in April-May last year.  Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that despite the surge, Mumbai is not staring at a lockdown or night curfew. “Deaths are under control. We are finding cases because we are testing nearly 24,000 people every day. We intend to double the number of daily tests; so, we expect to see cases rise further,” he said. Dr Sanjay Oak, chairman of the state’s Covid task force, told TOI, “The virus appears to be more infectious but less virulent. We are making sure that there are adequate beds for those in need.” He said people should be open to isolating in institutions rather than staying under home quarantine. The state’s daily positivity rate on Thursday was back to 21%, while Mumbai’s touched 13%.  Maharashtra’s Covid toll reached 53,138 with the addition of 58 deaths on Thursday, while Mumbai’s reached 11,559 with eight deaths. On September 11, Maharashtra’s worst day during the first peak, there were 442 deaths. Mumbai on October 10 had 48 deaths. The CM has directed district authorities to ensure that all field hospitals were repaired and made ready before monsoon. “With the surge in cases, district administrations have been asked to hire health staff on contract basis and also ensure that adequate beds are available with them,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope.  In the last 24 hours, over 1.21 lakh tests were conducted across the state of which 25,833 came back positive. Over eight districts in the state have either imposed a partial lockdown for some days or have announced restrictions on movement and have shut down schools, colleges and even imposed time restrictions on shops. At the state level, Pune circle (5,583) added the highest cases while Mumbai circle reported the highest deaths (14). While Mumbai’s first case was detected on March 11, most other corporations saw their first cases in April, barring Kalyan. In the initial months, Mumbai added more cases, which grew in the satellite townships since May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaidespite-surge-mumbai-not-staring-at-lockdown-bmc/articleshow/81577251.cms||Bhavika Jain

VTA president Shrawankumar Malu said, “The handling of Covid pandemic in our country and the ongoing vaccination drive are absolutely commendable. Kudos to our doctors, frontline workers, administrative offices and vaccine scientists for working 24X7 for humanity. Administering vaccines to more than 3.5 million people so far is a remarkable job. However, despite such wonderful awareness and availability of vaccines, we still find some citizens reluctant to take the shot.” Tejinder Singh Renu, secretary of VTA added, “We have realised that many youngsters and middle-aged people without any comorbidities are keen to take the shot, but being out of purview, they are unable to get vaccinated. By this letter, we appeal to the Union government and the administration to start phase 3 of vaccination in India so that those interested to keep themselves safe from this virus can take the shot without delay.” The association conceded that that the number of vaccine vials are limited, which is why there is a priority list, but stated that with many eligible people not attending their scheduled vaccination slots, precious time was lost. “During such a pandemic, it’s a race against time for safety. VTA requests the Union government to consider this in public interest and start Phase 3 as soon as possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vta-requests-centre-to-start-vax-phase-3/articleshow/81577215.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Academics slam Nagpur University decision to let colleges conduct PG exams||NAGPUR: The Nagpur University’s statutory members and academics in general have slammed the decision to hand over the postgraduate winter-2020 examinations to the colleges. The theory papers of PG third and fifth semesters of regular and ex-students are scheduled from March 25 to April 10. According to them, it would ensure that a majority of examinees clear the papers with flying colours. It would replicate summer-2020 exams, where maximum number of backlog students, who were consistently failing since last seven to eight years, cleared the papers, as they were conducted by the colleges. NU Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable defended the decision saying that they would be conducting online papers of nearly two and half lakh undergraduate students, which would be a big task. “In summer-2020, there were 72,000 final year examinees, while first and second year students were promoted. This time, we would be conducting exams of all three years,” he told TOI. Senior academician Baban Taywade, who’s also a college owner, said it would be difficult for their staff to conduct papers of such a large number of students, particularly in view of ongoing lockdown. “Right from paper setting to holding them, to evaluation, everything is to be done by our teachers. It’s difficult to conduct exams in view of restrictions of working with just 10 staffers.” Questioning NU’s decision, Senate member Manmohan Bajpyee said it would once again compromise with the quality and standard of education. “When the pandemic was at peak, it was okay to entrust responsibility on colleges. But after considering the consequences, NU should avoid handing them the exams work. It seems, NU is shrugging off its primary responsibility,” he said. MC meet to today to finalise exam agency Nagpur University (NU) has convened an emergent Management Council (MC) meeting on Friday to decide on the agency for conducting online exams. TOI on Wednesday reported how NU had failed to appoint agency even as papers were just 10 days away. Pro-VC Sanjay Dudhe refused to comment stating that the agency would be finalized during the meeting. Bajpayee, who had raised a query in this regard during recent Senate meeting, predicted that NU would most likely hand over the contract to Promarc Software that was blacklisted by Amravati University last year for a series of technical blunders. “Even as the exams are just a week away, NU is yet to finalise the tender. If the contract is awarded to any other agency, it would take a long time to get accustomed to NU’s system and get data of students. So, NU would have no choice but to rope in the same firm, despite a series of goof ups in summer 2020 exams,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/academics-slam-nu-decision-to-let-colleges-conduct-pg-exams/articleshow/81577218.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Chandigarh||Admit you failed to end drug menace and resign: SAD to CM||Chandigarh: The SAD on Thurssday asked Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to resign on moral grounds after admitting failure to end the drug menace and provide employment. SAD spokesperson Dr Daljit Singh Cheema criticised Amarinder for his refusal to reduce power tariff rates for both domestic and industrial sectors, admitting that the government would not implement the Rs 2,500 per month unemployment allowance to youth besides stating the Rs 90,000 complete loan waiver he had announced for the farming community would not be executed during the remaining term of the Congress government in the state. He also accused the chief minister of presiding over four years of corruption, scams, misrule and breakdown of law and order. “The chief minister claimed that he had never stated that he would end the scourge of drugs but had only maintained he would break the back of the drug menace,” Cheema told media persons. He also shared the CM’s written commitment in the party’s election manifesto which clearly states “drug supply, distribution and consumption four weeks vich bund”. The SAD leader said it was unfortunate that Amarinder, who had promised to waive of farmer loans amounting to Rs 90,000 crore, was taking credit for a marginal Rs 4,700 crore waiver which did not even cover the penalty imposed on farmers for not paying their loan installments and believing the loans would be waived off. He also criticised the VM for making bogus claims of implementing 85% of poll promises, saying not even 5% of the commitments made in the party’s election manifesto had been fulfilled. “The Congress government has also profited from the misery of the people by increasing VAT on petroleum products,” he added. The SAD spokesperson also said that the chief minister gave the impression that excise collection had gone up. “If this is so, why has the state debt increased by Rs 1 lakh crore in the last four years from Rs 1.73 lakh crore to Rs 2.73 lakh crore now?” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/admit-you-failed-to-end-drug-menace-and-resign-sad-to-cm/articleshow/81577220.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Dip in flu cases attributed to pandemic measures||Coimbatore: This is that time of the year when the district usually sees a spike in flu cases. However, this year is an exception. Doctors in most hospitals said they haven’t so far seen an increase in the number of patients with influenza-like illness and they attributed the dip in cases to people wearing face masks and schools remaining closed. According to them, there is also a section of people who are not seeking medical help, despite having cold and cough for fear of Covid-19 infection.The district has seen 705 people - 486 in February and 219 in March so far - visiting clinics with fever or flu-like symptoms since February 1. Of them, 220 were hospitalized. Government doctors said the figures for the same months were above 450 and 500 in the previous years.Dr Dinesh Narasimhan, professor, PSG Hospitals, said, “While we usually see a spike in flu cases at the beginning of summer, we are yet to see general fever cases among inpatients and outpatients this year.”Dr D Dhandapani, of Sundarapuram-based Sri Balaji Hospital, said while they used to get around 10-15 patients with fever, body pain, cold and running nose almost daily from February third week, the numbers were less this year compared to previous years. “The numbers were higher in December and January, with more than 25 people coming with fever, cold and cough and five of them testing positive for the Covid-19. The numbers are fewer so far this year.”Paediatricians too said they were not seeing any increase in viral fever or flu among children. Dr D Ashwath, KMCH, said, “This is mainly because schools are remaining closed and there is not much chance of viral transmission. And since Covid-19 is still around, children and adults go out wearing masks, limiting transmission of fever and cold to others.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dip-in-flu-cases-attributed-to-pandemic-measures/articleshow/81577216.cms||---

When the four cubs were last seen, the tigress’ carcass was nearly three days old. For some reason, they were not rescued. Foresters claimed they were yet to verify if the tigress was their mother. Kaushalendra Singh, a former member of the Uttarakhand state wildlife board, had said it was highly improbable that the cubs were the offspring of another tigress. Experts feared that without the mother’s feed and its protection from other carnivores, the cubs’ chances of survival were slim. Besides, they could fall in the hands of poachers. A day later, a massive search operation was launched by the forest authorities. But the cubs could not be traced. Not a single picture was captured on any of the camera traps set up in the vicinity where the carcass of the tigress was found. In the face of criticism, Naveen Khandelwal, deputy director of PTR, said, “It now seems that the field forest team mistakenly identified a jungle cat’s cubs to be tiger cubs due to complete confusion at the time the carcass was found. The massive combing operation was discontinued as it was disturbing other tigers in the area.” Surprised, GC Mishra, former field director of Dudhwa tiger reserve, said, “The tiger cubs are quite distinctive in colour and stripe pattern. A two-month-old tiger cub is bigger in size than a full-grown jungle cat. It is quite impossible for the field forest staff members, who spend most of their time in the wild and are deemed to be experienced enough in identifying a wild animal, should display such confusion.” Kaushalendra Singh accused PTR personnel of a cover-up for failing to rescue the cubs when they were first spotted. He said,“PTR has ultimately lost four future tigers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/ptr-loses-4-tiger-cubs-search-called-off/articleshow/81574597.cms||Keshav Agarwal
---||Kochi||Drive to clear catfish from Periyar Tiger Reserve||IDUKKI: To protect indigenous aquatic species inside the Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR), members of tribal eco-development committee (EDC) are carrying out a five-day special drive to eradicate African catfish from the Periyar lake. Within three days of the drive, about 475kg of African catfish was fished out from the lake, said PTR East division deputy director A P Sunil Babu. The drive was launched after it was found that catfish was posing serious threat to local fish species in the lake. The Periyar lake is home to 47 fish species and seven of them are endemic. “Thelake is known for the endemic fish fauna. Catfish species are posing a serious threat to the existence of local fish varieties and other species in the lake. The drive will end on Sunday,” said Babu. “It is believed that catfish might have reached the lake from nearby fish farms when they were flooded. Increasing number of catfish also raises threat to a group of tribal community. Their main source of livelihood is fishing from the lake,” said Babu. “If the number of catfish increases in the lake, it will predate on native fish species. The main factor that led to the depletion of local fish varieties in the lake was the spread of catfish that directly feed on native fish varieties. We hope the special drive will help to eradicate catfish from the lake,” said the official. “A group of people from Mannan and Paliyan tribal communities were engaged in fishing the catfish and the drive will continue till the International Day of Forest that falls on March 21,” added the official. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classification in 2016, seven of the 36 species in the Periyar Lake were critically endangered, six engendered and eight vulnerable, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/drive-to-clear-catfish-from-periyar/articleshow/81576091.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Nagpur||Change of guard during RSS triennial meet?||Nagpur: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s (RSS) first ever triennial meet — Pratinidhi Sabha — to be held out of Nagpur will start at Bengaluru on Friday. All eyes are on the event as speculation is rife that Bhaiyyaji Joshi may finally step down as the Sarkaryavaha, or general secretary of RSS. The Sarkaryavaha is like the CEO, who is actually involved in running the organization. Normally, the Sarkaryavaha also takes over as Sarsanghchalak or the RSS chief eventually. Joshi is, however, three years older than Mohan Bhagwat, the present Sarsanghchalak. The age factor too goes against him. There are chances that Dattatreya Hosabale, who hails from Shimoga in Karnataka, may take over, said sources. In a video released by RSS, Arun Kumar, the Akhil Bharatiya Prachar Pramukh or spokesperson, is seen saying ‘Bhaiyyaji’ and then, after a pause, adding ‘whosoever will be the Sarkaryavaha at that time will answer the journalists’ questions’. He was speaking at a press conference in Bengaluru before the two-day Sabha. Kumar was explaining that the general secretary will be briefing the media on the last day of the meet. In RSS, the Sarkayavaha is elected every three years, but extensions are also common. Joshi himself has been at the post since last 12 years. There were strong rumours during the Pratinidhi Sabha of 2018 that Joshi may be replaced by Hosabale. The meet was attended by Amit Shah, the then BJP president. Hosabale is known to be the favourite of Amit Shah-Narendra Modi group. Though Joshi continued, it is believed that his case was backed by Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari. If Hosabale gets the post it may also be an indication that BJP now has a bigger say in the Sangh Parivar. The Pratinidhi Sabha is attended by heads of RSS’ regional level units like Vidarbha apart from national heads of other Sangh Parivar outfits, including the BJP. The yearly meet of 2020 was planned to be held at Bengaluru, after that it was decided to also hold the triennial year meet there. A section of senior functionaries, however, said there appears to be no need to change the Sarkayavaha. This is because Bhagwat and Bhaiyyaji Joshi also share a good rapport with the BJP leadership and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “A number of factors need to be considered. Bhaiyyaji is 73 years old at present and RSS would need younger persons at the helm. If given an extension, Bhaiyyaji would be 76 years old by the time the next tenure ends. The organisation may prefer to have persons up to 75 years of age,” said Dilip Deodhar, an independent observer of RSS. Normally upto 1,500 persons attend the meet. The numbers are down due to Covid and the venue was also changed at the last minute. There were apprehensions that the state government may impose curbs due to Covid. Moreover, Bengaluru also has the required IT infrastructure for holding a virtual meet with those who will not be attending. To take over as Sarsanghchalak it is preferred that the person has been a Sarkayavaha. The age factor is against Bhaiyyaji for his transition to Sarsanghchalak’s post, as he is already three years older than Mohan Bhagwat. At 71, Bhagwat can easily continue for another four years, Deodhar said. Bhaiyyaji is also the first Sarkayavaha who is older than the present Sarsanghchalak, said Deodhar. There may still be a group within the RSS that may naturally prefer Bhaiyyaji over Hosabale, said Deodhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/change-of-guard-during-rss-triennial-meet/articleshow/81575127.cms||Shishir Arya

Chugh not only accused Amarinder of playing ‘deceptive politics’ but also of exposing himself as a “loser and a non-achiever” at the end of his four years in power. None of the poll promises made by the Congress have been fulfilled, be it pension for joblees youth, job for every household or doing away with drugs, he said. At best, the Amarinder government has been paying lip service to farmers and failed to waive off their loans to the tune of Rs 90,000 crore, give employment for family members of farmers who committed suicide due to heavy indebtedness and providing minimum income to farmers, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mere-lip-service-says-chugh/articleshow/81577248.cms||---

The FIR was registered on the order of the chief judicial magistrate court against sub-inspector Mahesh Dubey and constables Mohit Soni, Rakesh Singh and Balwant Kumar. They have been booked for attempted murder, conspiracy, destroying evidence and illegal confinement. Pulast’s mother Manjula Tiwari had filed a petition in court alleging her son had been picked up by police from their Sarvodaynagar house in Gazipur police station area on August 9, 2020 and later shot at and sent to jail. “My son was booked in a SC/ST case after which police slapped several cases one after another on him. Some sympathizers in police advised us to leave Aashiana where we had been living for 12 years and so we moved to Sarvodaynagar,” she claimed. “On August 9, 2020, SI Mahesh Dubey and constables Mohit Soni, Balwant Kumar came and took Pulast along with them. We kept pleading he was innocent but they didn’t listen. We recorded the conversation on phone. The CCTV footage also shows Pulast being taken by police,” she said. Later, police officials informed her that Pulast was asked to stop for checking while he was riding a bike without number plate but he tried to flee and opened fire at cops. He was hit in the leg when police fired in retaliation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fir-against-4-cops-in-tiwari-encounter-case-on-court-order/articleshow/81578402.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) plans to restart the jumbo hospital at College of Engineering Pune by next week in view of the rising Covid-19 cases. This will add 100 oxygen supported beds to the civic bed tally. “These 100 beds will be operational in four days. We are keeping a watch on the situation,” senior PMC official Rajendra Muthe said. According to PMC officials, the standing committee has approved Rs 7.5 crore for the facility. Rajesh Patil, PCMC commissioner, told TOI that they would increase the capacity of the beds by involving private hospitals in the civic limits. “There is ample bed availability and new medical facilities are to be roped in to ramp up the infrastructure to meet the needs of the citizens. The New Jijamata hospital and New Bhosari hospital will each have at least 25 ICU beds and if need be, we will be activating the Annasaheb Magar stadium jumbo hospital as well.” Rajendra Wabale, dean, Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital, said they were increasing their overall bed capacity for Covid patients, after it was lowered to less than 100 beds when patient numbers dipped significantly. Activist Maruti Bhapkar said the civic bodies should keep the bed availability data updated for the convenience of citizens. “We will write to the health minister Rajesh Tope and Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao about the update issue, and if the issue still persists, we will stage a protest,” he said.

---||Chandigarh||Capt has admitted he never promised complete eradication of drugs: AAP||Chandigarh: On the completion of four years of Congress government in Punjab, the AAP on Thursday said that chief minister Amarinder Singh has himself “admitted” that he never promised to eradicate drugs from Punjab and that he was only talking about breaking the back of the drugs trade. Addressing a press conference, leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema alleged that while the chief minister was claiming that 85% of the election manifesto had been fulfilled, in reality it would be 0.85%. “The Congress government had promised to provide employment to the educated youth and promised to eradicate mafia rule from Punjab, which has not been fulfilled yet,” he said. “Amarinder Singh, who talks about development works in Punjab, sees development only around the Siswan farmhouse, from where he never comes out. This is the reason why Captain feels that Punjab has developed,” he added. Referring to the ever-increasing power prices, the AAP leader said that the ruling party had promised to reduce it before coming to power. Even the CM, while showing the papers in the assembly, had said that the ‘white paper’ was ready and would be issued soon, but nothing has been released yet, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-has-admitted-he-never-promised-complete-eradication-of-drugs-aap/articleshow/81577261.cms||---
---||Mumbai||HC directs CAG to probe Mumbai-Pune E-way toll in Mumbai||Mumbai: Bombay high court on Thursday directed Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) to conduct a “thorough” inquiry into toll collection on Mumbai-Pune Expressway. “We require CAG to file a comprehensive affidavit in reply, dealing with points raised in the petition and the reply of MSRDC. Such an affidavit shall be filed after making a thorough inquiry into accounts of MSRDC,’’ said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni. The direction came on PIL filed last year by four activists based on CAG’S 2005 report, to declare illegal toll collection after August 2019, when a 15-year contract ended. MSRDC’s reply said toll will continue till 2030 as it had not fully recovered the project cost. It has to recover Rs22,370 crore toward capital outlay, which includes cost, operation and management charges, interest, etc, of the project after adjusting revenue received. On Wednesday, MSRDC said in 2004, the outstanding capital outlay was Rs3,632cr and, as of today, Rs22,370cr has to be recovered. The judges found it “difficult to believe” that the estimated capital outlay could not be recovered and that “Rs3,700 cr has become Rs22,000 cr”. They were miffed at not getting satisfactory replies on construction cost and maintenance in 2000-04. Senior advocate Milind Sathe, for MSRDC, submitted documents, saying they had CAG reports for three financial years. Petitioner-advocate Pravin Wategaonkar said the issue was whether capital outlay had been recovered or not. The judges told CAG’s advocate, “Tell us what was the capital outlay and if it has been recovered or not,’’ said the CJ. They directed CAG to look into allegations against the earlier contractor in an October 3, 2019, letter to state chief secretary to stop toll. The PIL said Mhaiskar Infrastructure Pvt Ltd was awarded toll rights from August 2004-August 2019 for an upfront payment of Rs918 cr for estimated revenue of Rs4,330cr. Revenue on July 31, 2019, was Rs6,773cr, so Mhaiskar made “undue gain’’ of Rs2,443cr. The judges posted the matter “for further consideration” on April 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-directs-cag-to-probe-mumbai-pune-e-way-toll-in-mumbai/articleshow/81578458.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Delhi||Rs 60-crore heroin seized, 2 arrested||New Delhi: Heroin worth Rs 60 crore has been seized from two smugglers who were arrested by Delhi Police’s Special Cell from north Delhi on Wednesday. According to DCP Sanjeev Yadav, the arrested men have been identified as Shehzad from Hapur in Uttar Pradesh and Amir Khan from Seelampur, Delhi. The accused have disclosed that heroin consignments were being pumped in north-eastern states of India through a porous Indo-Myanmar border, from where it was supplied to West Bengal, Bihar and other eastern states. “Probe has revealed that they took consignments of crude heroin from Bihar, as there was negligible chance of mixing impurities in crude heroin as compared to refined one. The crude drug was processed at destined places in UP and Madhya Pradesh to refined form and then only it was distributed through vendors in Delhi, NCR and other parts of the country,” the DCP said. For transportation purpose, they had got secret cavities made in vehicles’ doors and under the footrest. The smugglers were arrested by a team comprising ACP Jasbir Singh and inspector Krishan Kumar after they received a tip-off about the suspects coming to Majnu ka Tila. Shezad used to work as a bouncer earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-60-crore-heroin-seized-2-arrested/articleshow/81577318.cms||---

The premier institute, which has already reported Covid infection to 14 cadets on March 14, has announced closure of its campus till further notice. SPI director Col Amit Dalvi said all 17 cadets tested positive for Covid-19 were asymptomatic. “The new confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been detected during the second round of Covid testing carried out on the campus after the earlier outbreak. Three staff members who tested positive include one PT instructor, watchman and sanitation worker. All infected students and staff have been admitted to Covid Care Centre at Kil-e-Ark area of the city,” he said. SPI authorities said 69 cadets who have tested negative will leave for their homes as a precautionary measure. “Many parents were keen to take their wards home amid outbreak of Covid-19 on the campus. The district administration and health authorities have permitted us to send these students to their homes. The parents and guardians are expected to take these cadets homes in next 24-hours,” Dalvi said. The SPI, which has reported a total of 34 confirmed cases, will be sealed by the local civic body once all the students leave the campus. Meanwhile, the SPI has postponed the interviews of shortlisted candidates for admissions to academic year 2021-22 due to outbreak of Covid-19. The interviews were scheduled between March 22 and April 1 in Pune. “The revised time-table of interviews will be announced shortly after reviewing the Covid situation,” SPI has said in a statement. Established in 1971, the state-run institute prepares cadets for premier defence institutes in the country including National Defence Academy and Naval Academy. The institute had received as many as 13,082 applications for academic year 2020-21 against an intake capacity of only 60 seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/17-more-cadets-3-staff-members-test-positive-at-spi/articleshow/81572307.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Mumbai||Daughter can question validity of dad’s 2nd marriage: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Wednesday set aside a family court order and directed it to hear and decide a suit filed by the daughter of an industrialist who questioned the validity of his second marriage in 2003, after her mother’s death.  The daughter alleged she learnt only in 2016 that the second wife was “already married and not divorced, a fact she allegedly had suppressed” from the industrialist. The woman said she was divorced in 1984 through a talaqnama and, hence, her marriage was valid. A bench of Justices R D Dhanuka and VG Bisht said the family court was wrong in holding that the daughter was barred from questioning the validity of her father’s marriage invoking a rule meant to prevent multiplicity of litigation. The bench agreed with senior counsel Vineet Naik and advocate Sheroy Bodhanwalla that only the family court has the jurisdiction to decide on validity of a marriage and hence the rule barring multiplicity of suit was not applicable. The daughter, aged 66, had filed an appeal in 2019 against the Bandra family court’s rejection of her plea to declare the marriage invalid. The order noted that Deepti Panda with K Chandarana, counsel for the second wife, 66, vehemently argued the daughter had no right to question validity of her father’s marriage. She said no third party could seek a declaration over validity of a marriage. Observing that the family court Act provision was “widely couched”, the HC judgement said the daughter “has every locus to bring in question the validity of the marriage of her father” to the second wife and also to her marital status. While rejecting the daughter’s plea, the family court had said she had earlier approached the Bombay high court after her father passed away in June 2015, but she had not questioned the marriage then and, hence, had relinquished her right to do so. The daughter and her siblings on one side and step-mom on the other have disputes pending before the HC for administration of the man’s estate, with both sides alleging the other wants to usurp the assets. The daughter’s case is her mother died in February 2003 and her father remarried in July 2003 before a marriage officer in Mumbai. Her plea before the family court was to declare her father’s wedding void. The second wife, objecting to the plea, said it was barred by law of limitation and should have been filed within three years of the marriage. Since the daughter said she only learnt of the second wife’s “alleged fraudulent conduct” in February 2016, there was no delay in her petitioning the court, the HC held. It directed the family court to decide her plea within six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-daughter-can-question-validity-of-dads-2nd-marriage-in-mumbai/articleshow/81577333.cms||---
---||Lucknow||LU girl harassed, intimidated for complaint; VC takes note||LUCKNOW: A group of Lucknow University students, who first harassed a girl student and then tried to intimidate her in a classroom after she tweeted her complaint, have been let off by authorities with a verbal warning. Chief proctor Prof Dinesh Kumar said he was probing the matter and action will be taken if anybody is found guilty. LU vice-chancellor Prof AK Rai said the girl has said that she will formally lodge a complaint if the accused repeat the offence. The accused have been consistently denying harassing the student, he added. The victim, a commerce undergraduate girl student, had taken to Twitter on Wednesday to report the harassment. Naming a boy, a BCom student, she tagged CM’s office, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, VC and other LU officers and requested action against him. The VC responded swiftly, assured full security and strict action against the accused, besides sharing his personal number on which the girl can call in case of emergency. He also directed LU officers to look into the matter. The girl told TOI that the incident took place on Tuesday. "After classes, my friends and I went to Tagore lawn for lunch break. My friends sat on the bench and I was about to sit when a boy came running and took the seat. He was joined by other boys and together they started passing lewd remarks. One of the boys asked me to sit on his lap. We left the place. Later in the night, I searched on social media and identified one of the boys,” she said. The girl tweeted she complained in the wee hours (1.57pm) on Wednesday. In the morning, the VC took note of the tweet and replied to her giving assurance of security and called her to meet him in his office during the day. However, before the girl could go to meet the VC, the accused boys, who had also seen the tweet, came to her classroom and asked the teacher who was taking the class to send her and her friends outside. “When the teacher inquired the reason, the boys told him that the VC wanted to meet the girl. The teacher, however, told the boys that he himself will call the VC to verify the facts. At this, the boys left the classroom,” she said. “After the class, I went to meet the VC who assured me that I will be safe on the campus and take strict action against those boys. He also gave me his personal number for any emergency,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-girl-harassed-intimidated-for-complaint-vc-takes-note/articleshow/81578434.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Greens root for Aaditya as Maharashtra forest minister||NAGPUR: It is nearly a month that state forest ministry is without a minister after Sanjay Rathod quit. Though chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is holding additional charge, leading lights in the wildlife conservation field want environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray be handed over the reigns of forest ministry. Aaditya had recently spent some time in Tadoba. Even as rumours are doing rounds about someone from Vidarbha may head the ministry, greens say forest is linked to tourism and also environment and climate change and hence both the ministries should be with one minister. “Though Uddhav Thackeray is known as a green chief minister and has taken several bold decisions to save forest and environment, he would not be able to take time out for forest ministry considering his busy schedules,” feel the greens. “Forests and health; forests and climate change; forests and the environment — all are inseparable. Not just ministerial portfolios, it makes great economic and social sense for these three key ministries and departments to have a revolving door of cooperation and coordination between them,” says environmentalist Bittu Sahgal, Sanctuary Nature Foundation (SNF). “Forest department becomes most important, especially when the world is facing climate change crisis and pandemics. Hence, the department needs a full-time cabinet minister. Aaditya Thackeray understands forest and climate change subjects better than anyone else and is very dynamic. The state forest department needs a minister like him,” said wildlife conservationist Kishor Rithe. Anish Andheria, president, Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT), said, “Natural ecosystems form the foundation on which rests the present and future of all life on earth, including that of human beings. Therefore role of the forest minister cannot be overstated.” “On the sound decision-making ability of the minister depends sanctity of our wildernesses. Aaditya Thackeray and his family’s passion for nature and wildlife is well-known. His appointment as forest minister of Maharashtra will go a long way in giving importance to the natural ecosystems,” said Andheria. State wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre said, “If you see at the Centre, environment and forest ministry have always remained with one minister with independent charge. Aaditya Thackeray has shown his skills in saving forest and wildlife, demanding to scrap controversial coal blocks like Bandar and Marki Mangli-II. He leads the young generation, on whose shoulders the future of forest and environment depends. He also played crucial role in restoring Chandrapur’s historic Ramala Lake recently.” “Considering the rising human-animal conflicts, community development, protection of tigers, and other challenges the forestry sector is facing, Aaditya Thackeray is the fit candidate to take the reigns of the ministry,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/greens-root-for-aaditya-as-maha-forest-minister/articleshow/81575189.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||World||US, China spar in first face-to-face meeting of Biden admin||ANCHORAGE: Top US and Chinese officials offered sharply different views of the world on Thursday as the two sides met face-to-face for the first time since President Joe Biden took office. In unusually pointed remarks for a staid diplomatic meeting, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese Communist Party foreign affairs chief Yang Jiechi took aim at each other's countries' policies at the start of two days of talks in Alaska. The contentious tone of their public comments suggested the private discussions would be even more rocky. The meetings in Anchorage were a new test in increasingly troubled relations between the two countries, which are at odds over a range of issues from trade to human rights in Tibet, Hong Kong and China's western Xinjiang region, as well as about Taiwan, China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and the coronavirus pandemic. Blinken said the Biden administration is united with its allies in pushing back against China's increasing authoritarianism and assertiveness at home and abroad. Yang then unloaded a list of Chinese complaints about the US and accused Washington of hypocrisy for criticizing Beijing on human rights and other issues. ``Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability,'' Blinken said of China's actions in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and of cyber attacks on the United States and economic coercion against US allies. ``That's why they're not merely internal matters, and why we feel an obligation to raise these issues here today.'' Yang responded by demanding the US stop pushing its own version of democracy at a time when the United States itself has been roiled by domestic discontent. He also accused the US of failing to deal with its own human rights problems and took issue with what he said was ``condescension'' from Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and other U.S, officials. 'There is no way to strangle China,`` he said. US-China ties have been torn for years, and the Biden administration has yet to signal whether it's ready or willing to back down on the hard-line stances taken under Donald Trump. Just a day before the meeting, Blinken had announced new sanctions over Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong. In response, China stepped up its rhetoric opposing US interference in domestic affairs. Trump had taken pride in forging what he saw as a strong relationship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. But the relationship disintegrated after the coronavirus pandemic spread from the Wuhan province across the globe and unleashed a public health and economic disaster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/us-china-spar-in-first-face-to-face-meeting-of-biden-admin/articleshow/81579815.cms||---

---||Vadodara||VMC playing with fire as hospitals go easy over NOC||Vadodara: It has been over six months since fire broke out in the Covid-19 ward of SSG Hospital and yet, the authorities are yet to wake up from their stupor. No action has been taken against designated Covid hospitals that are operating without no-objection certificate of the fire department. The fire at Vijay Vallabh Sarvajanik Hospital on Mandvi-Panigate road on Wednesday night should serve as a final wake-up call as many hospitals continue to operate without proper fire-fighting equipment and NOC especially at a time when coronavirus cases are peaking again. Reliable sources in Vadodara Fire and Emergency Services said that the department is not allowed to take any action against hospitals, especially if they are Covid-designated and do not have fire NOC. Vijay Vallabh Hospital too does not have NOC and was “in the process to install all fire-fighting equipment”. However, fire already broke out in the server room and spread in the building. “The administration has given permissions to the hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients without going into the details whether the hospitals are equipped or not. If any untoward incident will take place in future, we will be held responsible,” said the source. At least 10 hospitals treating Covid patients do not have NOC, the source added. All attempts by TOI to contact municipal commissioner P Swaroop and chief fire officer Parth Brahmbhatt went in vain. On Wednesday night, panic gripped the area as fire broke out in the Vijay Vallabh Hospital and amid the chaos, nearly 25 patients, including 17 Covid infected, could be safely evacuated by the locals and firemen as the fire engulfed the four-storey hospital. Covid patients had to be sent to SSG Hospital in whichever vehicles that were available at that moment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vmc-playing-with-fire-as-hospitals-go-easy-over-noc/articleshow/81576115.cms||---
---||Delhi||Vice-chancellor says no threat to Ashoka’s liberal values, denies charges||NEW DELHI: “This is not my Ashoka.” Student after student attending a townhall with vice-chancellor Prof Malabika Sarkar repeated this even as the VC was winding up after a gruelling session that lasted for a little over 100 minutes on Thursday evening. A tight-lipped Sarkar had given out little even as she defended the trustees and the university amid a swirling storm over Prof Bhanu Pratap Mehta’s resignation, followed by economist Arvind Subramanian’s on Wednesday. The townhall, which was streamed live, was attended by over a thousand students, members of the faculty and alumni. The university community wanted the VC to give them the real reason for Mehta’s resignation since there were many rumours floating around and to tell them if the atmosphere of academic freedom was being compromised. Sarkar said she did not wish to discuss the contents of Mehta’s resignation letter because it was “confidential” as in any other university. Defending herself against accusations that there wasn’t any communication on the matter, she cited her busy schedule and the fact that things were happening very fast. However, she said that since then, she had called up Mehta and sent him an email too. “He has asked me to convey to you in no uncertain terms that he will not withdraw his resignation,” she said. Addressing a member of the editorial board of Ashoka’s student newspaper, ‘The Edict’, which had quoted a source – an unnamed faculty member – to claim that Mehta’s resignation was endorsed by the founders to help the university’s efforts to acquire a plot for its expansion and also get recognition of its fourth-year post-graduate diploma, Sarkar said the claim was “completely mistaken”. She added that the trustees had told her clearly that they didn’t ask Mehta to resign. When a member of the faculty told her that the university should have gone out of its way to persuade Mehta to stay back, Sarkar said: “I phoned Bhanu and told him not to resign. When I received the letter, I was in dilemma that I will be able to persuade him. So, I did not even put out a statement. I intended to ask him to withdraw his resignation. Upon my communicating with him, it became certain that he was not willing to withdraw. I have worked with Bhanu since 2015 and I really value him. He has worked to establish Ashoka as a research university.” On Subramanian’s letter, the VC said she had not responded yet as he wished to continue till the end of the semester. Asked by the faculty if they and the students needed to be alarmed in view of Ramchandra Guha’s accusation that the trustees had chosen to crawl when asked to bend, Sarkar said, “Ashoka is safe and I do not accept this.” “There was a time when the liberal values of the university were under threat. All of us fought and I had even signed a petition. Those times are gone. Today, Ashoka, I firmly believe, is a free space where people are encouraged to express. Let us not roll back to those days as we have traversed that. Our document on freedom of speech and expression was drafted after that. Today all of us should be confident…I think Ashoka has an exceptionally nurturing environment,” she said, insisting that in her one-and-a-half years as VC, she had seen no interference. Responding to a faculty member, she said she had no idea of what had transpired between Mehta and the trustees and that she was not part of any conversation or involved in any way. Insisting that the trustees have always been “facilitators”, she told the students and the faculty that they would soon hold a townhall with them. Soon after the townhall ended, Mehta’s letter began to circulate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vc-says-no-threat-to-ashokas-liberal-values-denies-charges/articleshow/81577342.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Kochi||Agrarian crisis crops up as poll plank||Idukki: The farmers of Idukki feel their various concerns -- from a decline in crop prices to damages caused by wild-animal attacks -- have largely gone unaddressed. With the assembly election around the corner, the farmers of the hilly district have urged the political parties to solve the agrarian crisis. "The government recently announced fixed prices for vegetables. But the farmers haven't received the benefits," said K Jayaprakash, president of vegetable farmers' society at Vattavada. Jayaprakash drops the example of carrot and cabbage farmers in the district. Vattavada and Kanthalloor are considered as the hub of cool-season vegetables and according to Jayaprakash, the harvest was much better this season. "But a farmer gets Rs 5-7 per kg for carrot and Rs 6 for cabbage (sold for approximately Rs 40 and Rs 25 per kg respectively). In this situation, the farmers have no option but to abandon the farms," Jayaprakash added. It is not just vegetable farmers who are calling for an intervention. The cultivation of cardamom, cloves, coffee, and pepper have all been hit. While the prices of coffee and pepper have remained low for several years, the price of cardamom that had averaged Rs 3,000-4,000 per kg last year has plummeted to Rs 1,200 per kg. As for cloves, a farmer reportedly gets Rs 470 per kg for the commodity that is sold in the market at around Rs 800 per kg. Jomon Kizhakkekara is a clove farmer in Idukki who has suffered losses. “The price fall of agricultural goods is a major challenge to farmers. The farmers cannot survive with this income,” said Kizhakkekara who has decided to destroy his cloves to plant cardamom next season as the latter though not as profitable as before is relatively better placed in the market. For medium and small-scale farmers wild animal attacks on farms and residential areas is another issue. Fr Sebastian Kochupurakkal, general convener of High-Range Samrakshana Samithi (HRSS) said: “Years back, farming was considered as a major source of income in the district. The two floods in recent years have only widened the severe crisis. The agrarian issue should be the focus of political parties in the election.” DCC President Ibrahimkutty Kallar has said that Congress will raise the issue as its main poll plank in the district. Meanwhile, CPM leaders have reiterated that the Rs 12,000 crore special package that was announced recently for the district has remedial measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/agrarian-crisis-crops-up-as-poll-plank/articleshow/81576140.cms||Sandeep Thomas

The accused Varun alias Arun Patel was detained on Thursday for stabbing Devji Solanki, a labourer, to death outside the latter’s home. According to police, when Solanki’s daughter Anjali was walking back home after seeing her aunt off, Patel stopped her outside the lane of her house. Patel made lewd comments at her, hearing which she went home and told her parents about it. Solanki went to Patel’s house in the same neighbourhood to confront him about his behaviour, but he was not found there. Solanki returned home after telling Patel’s wife about the harassment. Some minutes later, Patel went to Solanki’s house with a knife and shouted at Solanki. The 50-year-old man rushed outside the house but Patel stopped and stabbed him. As Solanki’s family members screamed in horror, Patel fled from the scene. Solanki was rushed to SSG Hospital where he succumbed during treatment. Based on Anjali’s complaint, an offence of murder and under sections of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act was registered against Patel at Karelibaug police station.“We have nabbed the accused but he will be formally arrested after his Covid-19 report arrives,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/50-yr-old-killed-by-daughters-harasser/articleshow/81576149.cms||---

The groom, Muhammad Yaseen, 23, and five other family members were shoved into a vehicle and taken to a nearby police station. Local police claimed to have recovered beef from their house which they said will now be sent to a forensic laboratory for confirmation if it was that of a cow. Meanwhile, even as the beef made its journey to the laboratory, police invoked UP’s Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act against the accused. All the six men, Yaseen, Mohammad Rafi, Muhammad Islam, Salam, Bhura and Babu Haji were produced before a magistrate and sent to jail. National Security Act (NSA) and Gangster Act will also be invoked against the accused, said Shagun Gautam, superintendent of police (SP), Rampur. “Tanda police had received information that the prohibited meat was brought in the house to be cooked and served in the wedding ceremony. A raid was carried out in Lalpur village and the accused were caught while they were chopping the meat. National Security Act (NSA) and the Uttar Pradesh Gangster Act will also be invoked against all the six offenders,” the SP said. When contacted, village head Haroon said, “The entire celebration has now turned into mourning. The family had purchased the meat to serve the guests.” Back home, with all the men in jail, women were now busy pulling down everything, the lights, decorations and tents. Orders were being cancelled and calls being made to stop relatives from boarding trains and buses for the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/wedding-called-off-groom-his-5-kin-land-in-jail-after-up-cops-recover-beef-from-their-house/articleshow/81574628.cms||Nazar Abbas

Cochin shipyard constructed the vessels at a cost of Rs 3.80 crore each. The Rs 2.70 lakh includes the amount spent for transportation, accommodation and service charge of the service engineers, who come from Maharashtra to repair the snag. Since the shipyard used sophisticated machinery in the vessels, unavailability of engineers in Kerala to repair the machine poses huge headache for KSINC. Besides the expenditure for repairing thruster control panel, the corporation has to spend additional amount for minor issues that the vessels develop. The trouble is repeatedly reported at the aft thruster control panel, which is getting heated. The first technical snag was reported in the module of the thruster control panel last year during summer. The same panel developed snag two weeks ago and it was fixed by placing a blower with the capacity of half HP to cool the panel room. “The same panel developed snag again two days ago and we placed one more blower with the capacity of half HP to cool down the panel room. Though the vessel resumed operation on Thursday afternoon, the snag was developed again in the night. We assume the panel getting heated might be one of the reasons for the breakdown of the vessel midway. The service engineer from Mumbai is expected to reach Kerala by next week. The other vessel has not developed any such snags so far. The vessel which developed snags was dry-docked last year,” said another official in KSINC. “The thruster control panels, installed in the vessels, were manufactured by a European company, which does not have service engineers in Kerala and corporation’s engineers are also not equipped to address the snags in the panel,” said a KSINC official. “Only one control panel develops snags regularly. We don’t know whether to replace it or not. We are awaiting the visit of the engineers from Mumbai to take a decision in this regard. Replacing control panel means we will have to shell out more than Rs 30 lakh. The vessels’ performance is satisfactory. Each vessel is operating continuously for nearly 15 hours per day,” said a senior official with KSINC. Fort Kochi-Vypeen ferry passengers’ association said the ferry boat, which was operating along the stretch, has suspended service for the past six months. “This makes matters worse. If any vessel develops snags, the passengers could have utilized the boat service. Kochi corporation is not willing to operate the boat on this stretch. The jetty where the boat can be anchored needs to be repaired. Until then the boat cannot be anchored there,” said Francis Chammany of the association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/repair-of-vessels-costs-ksinc-nearly-rs-3l/articleshow/81576174.cms||T C Sreemol

The revenue of Rs16 crore per day has gone down to Rs10 crore at present. However, instructions have been issued to all depots to ensure that the Covid protocol is not ignored,” Parab told TOI.An official with the Pune division of the MSRTC said they had recorded a 25% dip in passenger traffic. “Many districts have recorded a spike in cases and some districts have announced lockdown, so people are avoiding short travels. Many people have started working after being unemployed for long and don’t want to take any risk, which might jeopardise their work. The other reason is that people don’t want to get infected,” the official said.State transport body officials said that instructions have been issued to all depots across the state to be strict about following Covid protocol. “They must ensure that passengers wear masks during travel. Now, buses don’t stop for break during trips. Thermal checks of passengers are expected to begin in major depots soon,” another MSRTC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msrtc-records-lower-revenue-as-covid-arrests-movement-of-people/articleshow/81577343.cms||Joy Sengupta

Victim Ravindra Chandanshive (47) of Wagholi lodged an FIR on Thursday. An officer from the Mahalunge police chowkey, which comes under the Chakan police, said, “Chandanshive had parked his truck loaded with auto spares consignment on the roadside at Kuruli. He was in the vehicle when four men barged into the truck’s cabin and beat him up around 3am.” The officer said, “Later, the suspects covered him in a bedsheet and snatched the keys of the truck from him, taking control of the vehicle.” The four men then drove the truck towards Mahalunge and stopped near a logistics firm. Three of them transferred the spare parts into another vehicle, while one of them held Chandanshive inside the truck cabin. Chandanshive informed the transporter about the robbery and lodged the complaint after the suspects fled the scene. The police have registered the case under Section 394 (voluntarily causing harm while committing robbery) of the Indian Penal Code. The police said they were working on some clues and would arrest the suspects as soon as possible. “Our investigation is in progress,” the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/truck-driver-robbed-of-auto-spares-worth-rs-20l/articleshow/81577368.cms||---

Summer events like the flower show, fruit show and rose show would attract more tourists to the district. It would lead to crowds and create a difficult situation,” the letter said.The association requested the administration to take steps in advance to handle such a situation and offered help to check virus spread.

---||Lucknow||Virus shows July 2020 pattern, cases jump to 77||Lucknow: The spike in new Covid-19 cases continued in the city on Thursday with 77 more persons testing positive. On Wednesday, 54 persons had tested positive in the city. The steady rise in cases is now similar to the pattern witnessed in July first week last year, just before the big surge occurred that peaked in August-September. Sample this: in the past eight days, the number of new infections recorded daily increased from 17 to 77. A similar increase was witnessed from June 29 to July 6 last year when per day cases rose from 17 to 79. Another common factor between the two periods is that the number of recoveries is continuously lower than the new infections for several days. On Thursday, only 16 patients recovered in the city. As a result, patients with active infection cases have increased to 381. Of these, 182 patients are in home isolation and the others in hospitals. A week ago, on March 11, the number of active cases in Lucknow was 235. Among fresh cases in the past 24 hours, Alambagh recorded 13, Indiranagar 8, Gomtinagar 6, Talkatora 5 and Hazratganj, Rae Bareli Road, Aashiana, Aliganj and Aminabad 4 each. Health officers, however, said there was no need to panic now. “The fresh cases are limited to households/offices where one of the members/workers tested positive recently. Among those found positive on Thursday, 12 were trainees of the railway training centre in Alambagh. They were among 139 trainees who were tested after three of their colleagues tested positive on Tuesday. The camp has been converted into a containment zone,” said an officer. The time, said district immunisation officer Dr M K Singh, is to take precautions and not to panic. “Had people found positive and their families and colleagues taken due precautions, the infection would have not spread,” he said and added “Extensive contact tracing is underway to break the chain of virus”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/virus-shows-july-2020-pattern-cases-jump-to-77/articleshow/81578487.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

During the month of Ramzan, faithfuls keep a fast from dawn to dusk. Notably, government-run healthcare centres and private hospitals are administering the vaccine during daytime. The imam of the Jama Masjid in Daltonganj, Mufti Shahnawaz Qasmi, said Ramzan may start on or from April 13 depending on the sighting of the moon. Qasmi said that people are wise enough to decide what is good for their health and society. “Roza does not break owing to the administration of vaccine, as the latter is injected and does not affect the stomach directly.” However, a civil activist from Daltonganj, Mumtaz Ahmad Khan, said, “We understand that some people will find it difficult to visit the session sites during the day of fasting.” District reproductive child health officer Anil Kr Singh said, “The Covid vaccine is not a food item. So, there is nothing to worry.” A shopkeeper in Chainpur, Imtiayz, said that visiting a vaccination site while one is on fast might be a little discomforting. Rajnikant Mehta, a businessman, demanded that vaccination be held during the evening hours as well. “Sparing time for other things during working hours affects our sale. If the vaccination process is carried out well into the evening, then both shopkeepers and Muslim beneficiaries can take the vaccine without any hesitation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-problem-in-taking-vaccine-shots-during-ramzan-cleric/articleshow/81577038.cms||M F AHMED

A letter of confirmation issued by IBR said Maken, who hails from Namkum area, has set a record by recalling the multiplication tables from 75 to two in the reverse order in 11 minutes and six seconds. Maken's record will feature in the IBR publication soon. Virat, who is in Class 1 at the Phantom Army Pre-Primary School, achieved the feat by using unique calculation methods called "waves calculation" and "hand calculator’" which were developed by his father, Gagan Maken, during the lockdown period. Gagan said, "My son has an inclination for mathematics and when I introduced him to the new methods of addition and subtraction, he learnt them quickly. Soon, he was reciting tables in both forward and reverse orders at lightning speed.” Impressed by his son's skills, Gagan contacted the IBR which informed him that it has no instances of a child reciting the tables in the reverse order. He added that after a practice session, a video footage of Virat reciting the tables with his eyes shut was sent to the IBR. After a forensic examination of the video and the photos, the IBR confirmed the record. Gagan is a mathematics teacher and runs institutes in Namkum and Kantatoli localities. He has left the managerial job of a private bank to pursue his passion for mathematics. He claimed to have developed the waves calculation and hand calculator methods when he got spare time during the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/7-year-old-recalls-multiplication-tables-in-reverse-order-enters-record-books/articleshow/81577058.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||‘Unruly’ trainee cops hold up Ranchi vaccination drive||RANCHI: The vaccination drive and the work at the district Covid-19 control room at the district hospital were disrupted for more than an hour on Thursday after a group of trainee police inspectors created a ruckus and had a verbal spat with the healthcare workers on duty. According to sources, a group of trainee inspectors from a unit of the special police branch arrived at the hospital to collect their Covid-19 test reports around 11:30 am. As the result portal was experiencing a technical glitch, the staff on duty took a few minutes to fetch their reports. However, a couple of trainees lost their temper and started abusing the staff on duty saying that they are a part of the chief minister’s security and needed their reports immediately. Soon after, a verbal spat ensued and the healthcare workers started protesting and boycotted work charging the trainee policemen with ill-treatment. The boycott disrupted the vaccination drive at the centre. The matter was resolved after the local police intervened and both the parties agreed not to file formal complaints. A lab attendant, who was on duty, said, "We have been working without any leave since the last one year and have been providing assistance to everyone who visits us. If people in uniform start behaving like rowdies then what can we expect from others? The server was slow and that was the reason behind the few minutes' delay in providing them with the report but they started abusing one of our colleagues and threatened them with dire consequences, saying that they come from the chief minister's office and are part of CM security.” Lower Bazar police station officer-in-charge Satish Kumar, who visited the hospital, said, “The matter was settled amicably and the work resumed after the two unruly trainees were asked to step out of the centre. No complaints have been registered with us in this regard.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/unruly-trainee-cops-hold-up-ranchi-vax-drive/articleshow/81576258.cms||---

On Wednesday, Ranchi alone accounted for 45 of the 82 fresh Covid cases recorded in the state. The city accounts for 373 of the 599 active Covid cases in Jharkhand — the figure had fallen below below the 200-mark to 198 on February 5. The move also came after state health secretary K K Soan on Wednesday directed all deputy commissioners of the state to launch intensive campaigns on Covid-appropriate behaviour to ensure use of mask, sanitizers and social distancing in their respective districts. While launching the ‘No Mask-No Entry’ drive, deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan asked shop owners to follow ‘SMS (Social distancing, Masking, Sanitizing)’ protocols. Addressing the members of GEL Church Shop Owners’ Association, Ranjan said, “The district administration alone cannot beat coronavirus until people support us in the fight. The only solution for is to follow appropriate Covid behaviour.” He said, “It has been noticed that people have become relaxed and aren’t taking Covid-19 seriously due to the ongoing vaccination drive. The government has provided relaxations in rules for normalising life by allowing operations of cinema halls, shopping malls, restaurants and others with a few conditions and we need to ensure that they are being followed in toto.” The area of focus during Ranjan’s visit was jewellery, footwear and fabric shops where he asked the shopkeepers to ensure sanitisation of all visitors and employees at regular intervals. “Jewellery items, footwear, and fabrics are items that are touched by several people, which increases the chances of the infection spreading,” he said, adding the administration will soon slap fines if violations continue. Meanwhile, police were found warning people not wearing masks at Albert Ekka Chowk, Lalpur Chowk and other junctions of city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rising-cov-figure-gets-admin-on-streets-to-pull-up-masks/articleshow/81576991.cms||---

His joy knew no bounds when he wore the mayor’s gown soon after getting elected as ‘first citizen’ of the city on Thursday. Manohar was a strong contender when the Congress decided to spare the post for Kapu community in 2005. However, Kanna Lakshminarayana, then a minister in YS Rajasekhara Reddy’s cabinet, succeeded in getting his son Nagaraju appointed as mayor under Kapu quota. Manohar joined YSRC along with his local mentor and senior leader Lella Appireddy soon after YS Jagan Mohan Reddy launched the party. He worked as the new party’s youth wing president and was subsequently appointed as Pedakurapadu assembly constituency in-charge. He lobbied for assembly ticket in the 2019 elections, but Jagan decided to go with Namburu Sankara Rao. Upset with the development, Manohar’s followers threatened to quit the party. However, senior party leaders including Botcha Satyanarayana pacified him and promised him that his services would be rewarded once the party came to power. “I owe a lot to chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. He kept his promise and has given me an opportunity to serve the people of Guntur,” said Manohar after taking over the reins of the city’s civic body. He said he would soon chalk out developmental plans for the city as per the chief minister’s vision, adding that he would put the city’s development on the fast track with the support of legislators and corporators. Guntur Municipal Corporation has got a new governing council after nearly 12 years as elections were not held after the expiry of the previous council’s term in 2009. District collector Vivek Yadav presided over the swearing-in ceremony of the new corporators at the GMC council hall in the presence of SEC observer Lakshminarasimham. GMC commissioner C Anuradha conducted the proceedings. YSRC corporator Vanama Balavajra Babu was elected as deputy mayor. Home minister M Sucharitha, legislators Mustafa, Maddali Giri and KS Lakshman Rao attended the session. The ruling YSRC won 45 seats in the 57-member council. TDP got nine seats, while Jana Sena won one seat. The remaining two seats were won by YSRC rebels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/manohars-16-year-wait-comes-to-an-end/articleshow/81575269.cms||Samdani MN

Special public prosecutor A K Ray said, according to an amended law, a minor aged between 16 and 18 years can be tried as an adult at a children court. The gang-rape survivor had told police that the minor accused, who was around 17-year-old at the time of the crime, was the most aggressive and had also threatened to kill her. The court order said the minor will undergo “rigorous imprisonment for life term which shall mean imprisonment for the remaining period of natural life”. Ray said, “Justice K M Prasad passed the life term order and fined the minor Rs 50,000, both under Section 376 (D) (gang-rape) of the IPC. He would have to serve an additional simple jail term of one year in case of default of payment. The court also sentenced the minor to 10 years in prison and fined a sum of Rs 10,000 under Section 366 of IPC (kidnapping). He would undergo an additional term of six months in case of failure in paying the fine. Furthermore, the minor was handed over a prison term of one month under Section 341 (wrongful restraint) and one year term under sections 342 (wrongful confinement) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and three years rigorous imprisonment each under sections 379 (theft) and 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) of the IPC.” The court also stated that the amount collected as fines will be paid to the rape survivor. The accused was initially referred to the Juvenile Justice Board which transferred his case to the children court after an inquiry. Taking a serious view of the case, the Jharkhand high court had also ordered a speedy trial in the case. The 11 other accused in the case have already been convicted in March 2020 by judicial commissioner Navneet Kumar who awarded life sentences to all of them under Sections 376D, 366, 342, 379, 411, 323 and 120B of the IPC. The convicted persons are Sunil Munda, Kuldip Oraon, Sunil Oraon, Sandip Tirkey, Ajay Munda, Rajan Oroan, Naveen Oraon, Basant Kacchap, Ravi Oraon, Rohit Oraon and Rishi Tirkey.

---||Nagpur||99% less crowding in markets, shows drone study by police||Nagpur: The city police on Wednesday conducted a study using a drone in the localities surrounding Shanti Nagar on Wednesday to guage the impact of enforcement of extended restrictions. The study has underlined the fact that places like markets, where crowding takes place, had 99% lesser footfall between 12 noon and 5pm as compared to other days when restrictions were not in place. The extended restrictions kick-started from March 15 for seven days to put brakes on spike in Covid-19 cases. Zonal DCP Lohit Matani said a drone’s footage has shown there was an encouraging decrease of around 80% of the office-goers’ rush on the roads and least crowding in the inner lanes. “The beat marshall cops and police vehicles were pressed into action to send back loiterers inside their homes. The crowding at market, garden, malls and such places were mostly curbed with stringent enforcement strategies,” he said. More such studies will be conducted in coming days. City police seized 1,165 vehicles and recovered fine of around Rs 3.48 lakh on Wednesday. Around 267 people were pulled up for not wearing masks and another 1,006 for violating Covid distancing norms. Around 28 offences were registered by police. A supermarket was sealed at Panchasheel Chowk, and fine of Rs 25,000 was slapped on a financial institute at Gokulpeth. Also, a drive was undertaken at Walker’s Street, Japanese Garden and Futala Lake by making announcements in which six cycles and one car were detained while eight walkers were fined, said city police commissioner Amitesh Kumar. A video of a woman creating ruckus protesting police action at Shaheed chowk too went viral drawing criticism. City police had tough time calming down the woman who was later taken to Tehsil police station. The prospect of another round of restrictions in the backdrop of rising cases has left the people anxious. But the civic administration seems to think otherwise, say sources. The restrictions may be further extended till Holi (March 29) to prevent public gathering, sources added. The civic administration is of the opinion that given the community spread of the disease, at least fortnight-long restrictions may help in containing the spread of coronavirus, sources said. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that a decision on whether to extend the lockdown or not will be taken in a review meeting to be held on March 20. If the lockdown is extended, it will have more relaxations than previous weeks, sources said. With the ongoing lockdown, NMC had already reduced Aapli Bus fleet from 252 to 90. These buses are almost plying empty during afternoon hours. Passenger rush was only witnessed during morning and evening peak hours, said an official from NMC’s transport department. The nuisance detection squad of NMC also penalized 18 establishments, mostly shops, for disobeying Covid-19 protocols and recovered Rs 1.65 lakh fines from the owners. It has sealed two establishments, including an eating joint in Sadar and a shop in Jaripatka. Prabhakar Deshmukh, president of Nagpur Retail Kirana Association, said soon they will try to meet guardian minister Nitin Raut to discuss about relaxations in restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/99-less-crowding-in-markets-shows-drone-study-by-police/articleshow/81576216.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Rather, the whole process of corporatization is being implemented in an urgency. This has left the unions miffed. In a letter issued on March 15, joint secretary (land systems) Puneet Agrawal has asked the principal controller accounts of ordnance factory board (OFB) to urgently finalize the commercial accounts for the fiscal. The letter clearly says that accounts of each of the OFB units need to finalized soon considering the decision to corporatize the ordnance factory board (OFB). The letter says, “It is learnt that normally accounts are finalized after 3 to 4 months of financial year ending. However, for the year ending on March 2021, the process needs to be done faster to facilitate corporatization as decided by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS).” The secretary has requested the principal controller of accounts to personally look into the matter and also pool in extra resources if required. The union representatives told TOI that this is a clear violation of section 33 (1) of the Industrial Disputes Act abiding to which unions had called off the indefinite strike. The strike was supposed to start from October 12 last year. However, before that the three unions called off the strike and agreed for conciliatory talks with the government. Till then, the government too was expected to put its plans on hold, said the union leaders. This was under section 33 (1) of the Industrial Disputes Act. An alternate proposal instead of corporatization has also been submitted by the unions to the government. “We have already highlighted instances of violation of section 33 (1). Now, the unions will be meeting again and also take up the issue with central labour commissioner,” said C Srreekumar of All India Defence Employees Federation (AIDEF), a left-based union. He said the unions may also consider the strike option if the government continues with its stance. In a joint email sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and defence ninister Rajnath Singh, the three unions said that March 18, which happens to be the 220th ordnance factory day, is being observed as save ordnance factory day. The unions have been opposing corporatization saying that it would be the first step towards privatizing the ordnance factories. Once a public corporation, the factories will have to sustain on their own resources. The unions argue that due to the fluctuating nature of orders by armed forces, it may not be easy for the factories to be financially sustainable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/amid-talks-with-unions-govt-going-ahead-with-ofb-corporatization/articleshow/81576267.cms||Shishir Arya

Though the prisoner expired on June 3, 2013, and the death certificate was sent to the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC), the HC wasn’t informed for over two years. It was only after the HC directed the Amravati jail superintendent to furnish a report about Sarode’s mental status on July 22, 2015, that led to the revelation about his death.After Mugdha Chandurkar’s appointment as amicus curiae, she highlighted lack of coordination among respondents regarding the convicts’ status in jails. She pointed out irregularities and lapses on jail authorities’ part that led to hearing of an already abated appeal due to the prisoner's death by HC. “It’s because of non-supply of necessary information about Sarode’s health and death, the proceedings remain pending,” she mentioned.Earlier, HC registrar (judicial), while quoting emails of HC’s central project coordinator in Mumbai, informed that the prisons department would be changing its PRISMS software into ‘ePrisons’ developed by NIC in the meeting held on February 4. Once the data is successfully migrated, it would be easy to integrate ‘ePrisons’ with the Court Information System (CIS) software. After successful migration, about three months will be required for its integration with CIS.“The IG (Prisons) is directed to complete work of software migration and intimate it to the central project coordinator of e-Courts project in Mumbai and also to Nagpur bench,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said.While flaying jail authorities for lapses in Sarode’s case, the judges said similar blunders were committed and even by HC’s legal aid committees earlier. “In many cases, the convicts’ cases aren’t filed through the legal aid sub committee, but allocated to lawyers on their panel. Upon overall review of non-filing of the appeals through the legal aid sub committee or non-governmental organizations (NGOs), we find that it’s necessary for the state legal aid committee to look into all such appeals and matters of the prisoners/convicts to ensure actual filing,” they said.In its affidavit, the Maharashtra State Legal Service Authority informed that it’s in the process of establishing a prison reporting system through electronic link between jail and legal services authorities based on Karnataka’s module. In the ‘prison reporting system’, details regarding the current population and admission of under trial prisoners and other information can be accessed.ABOUT THE CASE* Prisoner Bhagwanta Sarode filed a case against govt in HC* He expired on June 3, 2013, death certificate sent to SHRC* Jail authorities failed to inform HC on his death for 2 years* His case was heard on July 22, 2015 & HC sought his status* Jail SP then informed that he expired about 2 years ago* Suo motu PIL filed for preventing lapses & better coordination||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/expedite-work-of-e-prisons-software-in-3-mths-hc-to-ig/articleshow/81576324.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The PM peppered his “development” narrative with references to Trinamool’s “appeasement politics” and its alleged culture of “tolabaazi (extortion)” and “cut money”. "Otyachar onek korechho, Didi. Bhoi dekhanoi tomar ostro. Rukhe darabe ebar Banglar manush. Ma Durgar ashirbade korbe tomay porasto (You have tortured people enough. Your only weapon is fear-mongering. People of Bengal will rise in opposition. They will defeat you with the blessings of Ma Durga),” he said at Hutmura in Jangalmahal. “I know how your rights and benefits are being denied. If Didi had any concern for the backward communities, she wouldn’t have turned this region into a hotbed of Maoists. People in Bengal know how coal mafia and the sand mafia are getting indulgence here.” As in his first Brigade rally in Kolkata on March 7, PM Modi said Trinamool even distribution of relief in the wake of the devastation wrought by cyclone Amphan last year wasn't spared by Trinamool's alleged system of taking cut money. "They (Trinamool) wanted the victims to deposit commission in the party office first to get relief materials," Modi said. "Under this process, you can get relief even if you didn’t face any loss. We believe in direct benefit transfer (DBT). They believe in 'transfer my commission', which stands for TMC. This is why Ayushman Bharat or the PM Kisan Nidhi schemes were not implemented, because 'TMC' doesn’t apply in those projects." The PM accused Trinamool of never considering Adivasis, backward classes and Dalits, who constitute a large section of voters in the Purulia belt, as its own. "These sections have been the worst victims of the cut-money culture and tolabaazi by the party," he said. Questioning why water-starved Purulia didn't have a water project yet, PM Modi said these were issues BJP would address. "The khela (game) over recruitment of teachers will also be done away with." Modi reminded the gathering that 36 lakh people in Bengal had received free LPG connections under the Bharat Ujala Yojana. "We have also increased MSP for forest produce. We have made huge allocations in the Budget for the education and employment of Adivasis and Dalits. Hundreds of Eklavya schools are being opened." Targeting CM Mamata Banerjee for her "stand" on issues concerning national security, the PM said, “People of Bengal have a strong memory. Bengal remembers who accused the Army of plotting a coup, and whose side you (Mamata) took during the Pulwama attack. People remember the stand you took when Delhi police officer Mohan Chand Sharma was killed in the Batla House encounter. A Delhi court has since exposed the forces behind it. The court sentenced one of the accused to death for killing the officer. These people (Trinamool) had sided with the terrorists and questioned the encounter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vikas-hobe-chakri-hobe-didir-khela-sesh-hobe-pm-modi-in-bengal/articleshow/81579824.cms||Amit Singh Deo

---||Nagpur||City lawyers oppose Maratha reservation in apex court||Nagpur: During online hearing on Maratha quota issue before the Supreme Court’s constitution bench, city lawyers on Thursday strongly opposed the Maharashtra government’s move to grant 13% reservation to the community.The lawyers were arguing for petitioner Devendra Jain, who challenged the state legislature’s competency to enact ‘Maharashtra State Reservation (of Seats for Admissions in Educational Institutions in State and for Appointments in Public Services and Post Under the State) for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018’. Initially, the enactment had provided reservation to the extent of 16%, but was reduced by the Bombay high court to 12% for education and 13% in public service for SEBC candidates.The lawyers led by Ravi Deshpande (Retired HC judge), Ashwin Deshpande and Hrishikesh Chitaley asserted that the SEBC reservation doesn’t stand the test of equality and can’t be permitted to operate and deserves to be stayed.According to them, the state’s endeavour under Article 15 (4) and 16 (4) of the Constitution of India, 1950, is to achieve equality and not to deracinate and annihilate its notion.Quoting the famous judgment in Indira Sawhney case, the lawyers contended that the Article 16 (4) is broader than Article 15(4) and not limited to SEBC. “The expression “backward class of citizens” employed under Article 16(4) include SCs, STs and all other backward classes of citizens, including the SEBC, who aren’t adequately represented in the services under the state.”Pointing out that the Government of India brought into force the ‘National Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993’, from February 1, 1993, the lawyers said its Section 2(a) defines “backward classes” as other than SCs and STs. Full report on www.toi.in“Its Section 2(c) defines “lists” prepared by the government from time to time for the purposes of making provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of backward classes of citizens which, aren’t adequately represented in the services under the government and any local or other authority within the territory of India ,” they said.Citing 102nd Amendment in the constitution, the lawyers said the state’s powers under Articles 16 (4) and 15 for making reservations are denuded in so far as SEBC are concerned, but for other ‘backward classes’ it remains same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-lawyers-oppose-maratha-reservation-in-apex-court/articleshow/81576339.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Nagpur||New rules for appointment of judges challenged||NAGPUR: A lawyer has moved the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court challenging the new rules framed by the Centre for appointment of judges in consumer forums. A division bench of Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Avinash Gharote on Wednesday issued notices to central and state governments asking them to file a reply within four weeks. The Union ministry of consumer affairs, Maharashtra government’s principal secretary, and state consumer commission’s registrar are the other respondents. Petitioner Mahindra Limaye challenged the New Rules 2020 framed by the central government under Section 101 of Consumer Protection Act, 2019, for appointment, qualification, eligibility, and removal of members of state consumer commission and district forums in India. Through counsels Tushar Mandlekar and Amit Malviya, the petitioner also challenged the February 2 vacancy notice for appointment of 33 members in state consumer commission and district forums. According to Limaye, the new rules are illegal and need to be quashed as those are contrary to the Supreme Court’s verdict in Madras Bar Association and UP Consumer Protection Bar Association cases. “The rules exclude lawyers having 10 to 20 years of experience from becoming members of the state commission. Those having 10 to 15 years of experience are barred from becoming members in district forums, thus violating Article 14 of Constitution of India,” he said. Contending that the rules are derogatory to constitutional principles laid down by the apex court regarding separation of powers and independence of judiciary, the petitioner said those create unreasonable classification amongst applicants where ordinary citizens are equated with the district judge. “The state conducts examinations of JMFC and district judges through MPSC, but there is no exam for consumer courts in Maharashtra. Therefore, there are possibilities that incompetent and less meritorious candidates will be appointed as judges,” said Limaye.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/new-rules-for-appointment-of-judges-challenged/articleshow/81576373.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Justice J R Midha held that the Kishore Biyani-led FRL “wilfully violated” the EA order and said it must face the consequences – slapping a cost of Rs 20 lakh, while ordering the debt-laden group against taking further action on the deal. HC also demanded an explanation why Biyani and others must not be sent to three months imprisonment since FRL’s intention is not honest while directing the presence of Biyani and others before it on April 28 and attachment of properties. Future Group and others associated with it have been directed to deposit the Rs 20 lakh cost imposed on them in the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund within two weeks for providing Covid-19 vaccines to senior citizens in the Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. “The respondents have taken Rs 1,431 crore from the petitioner solely on the basis of the rights provided by FRL to FCPL that they would not transfer their retail assets without the prior consent of the petitioner and never to a Restrict Person. Admittedly, the respondents have breached the agreements. However, there is no remorse. The intentions of the respondents do not appear to be honest. The whole thrust of the respondents before this Court is that the petitioner is a trillion dollar company and Rs 1,430 crore invested by them in the present case is peanuts for them and they should forget about this money as it is worth zero today,” Justice Midha noted in his order. HC cited Section 209 of the Indian Penal Code which says dishonestly making a false claim in a court is an offence punishable imprisonment up to two years and fine. “Section 209 is a very important provision to curb false claims but has been rarely invoked in our country,” the court noted while penalising Future Group and said for deliberately and wilfully violating the interim order dated 25 October, 2020, they are liable to face the consequences. HC’s order came on Amazon’s plea seeking direction to order enforcement of the award by Singapore’s EA on October 25, 2020, restraining FRL from going ahead with its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail. Future Group and Amazon have been locked in a battle after the e-commerce giant took FRL into the emergency arbitration over alleged breach of an earlier contract between them. The court held that the EA is an arbitrator for all intents and purposes and had rightly invoked the ‘Group of Company’ doctrine in relation to the Future Group companies. It said the respondents have raised a vague plea of nullity without substantiating the same and directed Future Group to approach authorities for recall of approvals granted for the FRL-Reliance deal and asked them not to violate the EA order. The high court also asked the Future Group to furnish details of action taken by it in connection with the Reliance deal after the EA order. Amazon, in its interim plea, has sought to restrain FRL from taking any steps to complete the transaction with entities that are a part of the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (MDA) Group. The three domestic firms -- FRL, FCPL and Reliance – have, however, contended before the high court that if Amazon’s claim -- that it indirectly invested in FRL by investing in FCL -- was accepted then it would amount to a violation of Indian foreign direct investment rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/setback-for-biyani-as-hc-restrains-future-reliance-from-moving-ahead-on-deal/articleshow/81579818.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Goa||Testing visitors not a solution: Travel body||PANAJI: With neighbouring states reporting a spike in Covid infections, there are demands that the state government commence testing travellers. However, the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) said that this would not serve the purpose, especially as the state lacks the infrastructure to smoothly test the 7,000 to 8,000 passengers who arrive daily, and the industry is struggling to stay afloat. TTAG said that instead Covid protocols have to be scrupulously implemented with no leeway given to violators. “I don’t know if checks or asking people to travel with a Covid-negative certificate will really help. Even in October and November, when cases were high, we did not have restrictions,” president TTAG Nilesh Shah said, adding that presently, in Goa, Covid cases are still on the lower side. Chief minister Pramod Sawant while admitting that the risk of Covid1-19 has increased, on Wednesday, had said that presently the government does not have any plans to impose any restriction. Sawant had placed the onus of Covid responsible behaviour on tourists and hotels. Echoing the sentiment, Shah said that hotels should refer their guests for testing if suspected to have symptoms. More than having border restrictions, the emphasis has to be on ensuring that people follow Covid appropriate behaviour, he said. “The government should penalise those who do not comply.” The TTAG’s demand with the government to install signboards in public places to warn people, specifically tourists, that they would face action if they do not wear masks and maintain social distancing has fallen on deaf ears. “We have had a sluggish February. Hotels are struggling to stay afloat. With Covid infections rising in other states automatically footfalls will go down,” he added. A health official said checking at borders is not practically easy. Besides having the required manpower deployed to do the work, it has to be seen that people are not left waiting in a queue for hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/testing-visitors-not-a-solution-travel-body/articleshow/81576604.cms||Bindiya Chari

The order was issued by district collector Ajit Roy, after health officer of the Panaji urban health centre brought to his notice that a large number of cases had been detected among its visitors. The sub-divisional magistrate, Tiswadi, has been made overall in-charge for sealing of the premises and maintaining law and order. Over the past many days, Panaji has been registering a rise in fresh infections. On Thursday, its caseload climbed to 110. State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said this is what they will have to do since cases are rising. “We have to stop people from visiting such places,” he said. He said the order shouldn’t be construed as something is wrong with the hotel. “Whenever, a collector issues orders to seal any premises it is done to contain the spread of the virus. It was good on the part of the hotel that they brought it to our notice about visitors testing positive. It means our standard operating procedure (SOPs) are working,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/city-restaurant-sealed-after-guests-test-ve/articleshow/81576623.cms||---
