---||Kolkata||Kolkata’s famous paanwallahs spread sweetness amid odds||A chewy, juicy paan has been India’s answer to mouth fresheners since Southeast Asian traders introduced it around 3,500 years ago. And the elaborate rituals we see our paanwallahs practice while making us a mouthful are over 1,500 years old. Paan making has been a thriving business, often handed down generations, in India since then. But then came the quick-fix alternative—gutkha. Shops that once saw people queuing up for a special paan were forced to sell gutkha and cigarettes to stay afloat. The situation is no different in Kolkata, where iconic paan shops have been battling the odds for quite a while now. And then the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Kalpataru Bhandar near College Square has been grappling with the changing reality for a while now. “Mine was an exclusive paan shop, but I’m now selling cigarettes and gutkha to keep the business afloat. People don’t have the patience for a special paan because it takes time to make,” said the current owner of the 92-year-old shop, Shyamal Dutta. The pandemic and the ensuing lockdown made things worse. For Arvind Kumar Chowdhury, owner of the 30-year-old Chowdhury Paan Corner on Sarat Bose Road, reopening his shop after the lockdown felt like starting all over again. “It was a struggle. Three of our employees went home to Bihar and one stayed back,” said Arvind, whose shop is known for its meetha gundi paan. For Md Shahbuddin, an owner of the 77-year-old Taj Mahal Paan Shop near New Market, sales have dipped drastically. “Before the lockdown I made around `25,000 a day selling our specialty ice paan. Now, I barely make `5,000 a day,” he rued. Some like Parsuram Sah, who runs a family of 13, are still hopeful about the future. “Last year was tough, but it couldn’t stop me from being positive about the future. The love I get from my regular customers gives me the courage to keep pushing ahead,” he said. A different futureAmong the many paan shops along the Gariahat road, Parsuram Sah has been running one since 1974. But Parsuram is not too keen on letting his children carry the legacy forward. “My eldest daughter is preparing for CA second round, my eldest son is studying MBBS in the Armed Forces Medical College, my younger son is studying in IISC Bangalore and my youngest daughter is awaiting her Class VIII results. She’s a keen dancer and has been participating in various reality shows,” said the proud father. Famous customers, goodwill galoreTaj Mahal Paan Shop has had many celebrity customers over the years. Owner Md Shahbuddin said, “I wasn’t born when Md Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar visited the shop for paan, but we have photographs of their visits. Since then, songs of Rafi saab always play in our shop.” Celebs and dignitaries have been visiting Kalpataru Bhandar for years now. “Ours was the shop of choice for Uttam Kumar and Manna Dey. Dilip Kumar, Md Rafi and PC Sorcar Senior also visited us. Former Presidents Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Dr Zakir Husain and former Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and PV Narasimha Rao also ordered paan from our shop whenever they visited Kolkata. We have certificates from them,” Shyamal Dutta told us.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkatas-famous-paanwallahs-spread-sweetness-amid-odds/articleshow/81675758.cms||Debolina Sen

---||World||Dawood’s ‘top henchman’ tells UK court it would be oppressive to extradite him to US||LONDON: Pakistani national Jabir Motiwala, who is alleged to be a lieutenant of the D-Company, has appealed against his extradition to the US. District judge John Zani, in a London court in February 2020, had ordered Motiwala’s extradition to the US to face trial for money-laundering, extortion and drugs trafficking. Appealing that decision at the high court on Wednesday, Edward Fitzgerald QC, representing Motiwala, argued that the US government had referred to Motiwala being the top henchman of Dawood Ibrahim throughout the extradition papers so it was highly likely that a “terrorism uplift” would be applied upon sentencing, leading to him being held in solitary confinement in a max security prison and sentenced to life without parole. This, he said, would be a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). “They say he is a member of the D-Company based primarily in Pakistan, India and the UAE, headed by Dawood Ibrahim, an Indian Muslim who has been in exile in Pakistan since 1993 when D-company was implicated in the Mumbai bombings,” Fitzgerald said. The US government has given an assurance that Motiwala will not be charged with terrorism offences but Fitzgerald said the terrorism assertions could be taken into account at sentencing and Motiwala’s severe depression would be exacerbated by a US high security prison and it would be oppressive to extradite him. He also presented a recording to the court which he claimed was of someone in the US prosecution service confessing he had been bribed to fabricate charges against Motiwala. John Hardy QC, representing the US government, said this allegation was so implausible even a TV producer would turn it down as a script. He also said the “US is not a third world country” and the risk of suicide in a US prison could be contained. Fitzgerald also claimed that since FBI informants caught Motiwala in an undercover operation in Pakistan without permission, the extradition was an abuse of process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/dawoods-top-henchman-tells-uk-court-it-would-be-oppressive-to-extradite-him-to-us/articleshow/81676719.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||Lucknow||Liquor bottles in Uttar Pradesh to carry 'responsible drinking' message||LUCKNOW: From April 1, any liquor you purchase in Uttar Pradesh will carry three messages aimed at promoting responsible consumption of alcohol. The messages, aimed at discouraging underage drinking, drunken driving and promoting responsible consumption of liquor, will be printed in bright red colour on all bottles, meant for sale in the state. Bottles being sold at present carry the messages like ‘Don’t drink and drive’ and ‘Consumption of liquor is injurious to health’ but these are printed in tiny lettering at the back of bottles, often almost invisible in the midst of other details printed on the bottle, said an official, adding that often, the colour of the font would be the same as the colour of the liquid which would make the print unreadable. Calling it a move similar to that of putting out warnings on cigarette packets, additional chief secretary (excise) Sanjay Bhoosreddy said that the state government had started a drive to promote responsible consumption of alcohol under the latest excise policy, for which Rs 1 crore had been allocated in the budget as well. “All bottlers were given directions to print these messages prominently on all bottles meant for sale in UP. Printing of labels for the fresh stock which will be available in shops from April 1 would have started by mid-March. This is applicable for liquor which is being bottled anywhere in the country but meant for sale in UP,” said Bhoosreddy. The stock from the previous year which will be rolled over to the new financial year already has two lines of warning printed on it. “Under the new excise policy, the government has made beer cheaper, done away with the roll over fee for stock from one financial year to the other and not increased excise duty on any brand. However, while making liquor more affordable and easy to access through shops in malls etc, it is also focussed on ensuring responsible consumption which is why this dedicated awareness drive is being launched,” said an official. On Tuesday, the government had declared the upper limit of liquor under various categories which can be stored at home legally. Keeping anything above that will require a person to purchase an annual licence for Rs 12,000 with a security deposit of Rs 51,000. From 44.6 litres, the limit for free storage of liquor under the new excise policy of 2021-22 has been reduced to 26.5 litres in a bid to crack down on illegal trade of liquor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/liquor-bottles-in-uttar-pradesh-to-carry-responsible-drinking-message/articleshow/81676807.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Forget enemies, this Holi should be a hug-free, socially distanced event even while celebrating with friends and family. Last year, due to coronavirus fears, several Holi parties were cancelled. This year, too, Delhi Disaster Management Authority has banned gatherings, congregations and public celebrations during Holi, Shab-e-Barat and Navaratra due to the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. So if you are planning to attend a private party, here’s your safety guide for a low-key Holi celebration: No sharing of drinks, no pool partiesThose who have recently attended Holi parties say that it’s a common gesture to offer your drinks to your loved ones at such parties, and that too, from your own glass. But if you are an attendee or an organiser, ensure that doesn’t happen this time. Sahiba Kaur, a consultant, who works with infrastructure and transport systems, recently attended a Holi party at a hotel in Gurgaon. She says, “Every year, people would offer bhaang to each other and we would even drink from each other’s glasses. This year, I have made a mental note to finish my drink and ensure that I do not touch anyone else’s drinks.” Experts suggest that you should wear a mask and maintain social distancing while attending Holi parties While swimming pools used to be the most favoured location for Holi parties, this year, people are ensuring that there are no pool parties and have shifted the venue to indoors or terrace. Abhijeet Pratap, who works in the catering business, says, “We are planning to organise a Holi party with close friends and we have decided to not include any water games at all. We’ve also shifted the venue from the swimming pool area to the terrace.” Smaller gatherings, private rooms for Holi partiesOther factors that people are keeping in mind while attending a party include vaccination and the number of strangers coming to a party. An event organiser says, “All major Holi events and parties have been cancelled, but small parties are being organised across the city with only a handful of close friends and colleagues in attendance. For such parties, most of the bookings are at hotels. But these are close group parties of five to 10 people as we do not want to take any risks.” Another event organiser adds, “Holi parties could be super-spreader if precautions are not taken. Gale milne se, gulaal udane, aur bhaang share karne mein risk hai.” He adds, “Only those parties are organised where people know each other or are meeting in the office anyway and are well aware that there’s no risk in partying together.” — With inputs from Riya Sharma||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-plans-low-key-intimate-holi-parties/articleshow/81670696.cms||Niharika Lal
---||World||Biden taps Harris to lead diplomatic effort to stem immigrant flow||WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has entrusted his Vice President Kamala Harris with the task of leading the diplomatic effort and working with neighbouring Mexico and Northern Triangle nations of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to stem the flow of immigrants to the southern border. Biden said nobody is better qualified than Harris, who ran the second-largest attorney general's office in America, for this. "This new surge (of migrants) we are dealing with now started with the last administration but it is our responsibility to deal with it humanely and to stop (it from) happening and so this increase has been consequential," Biden told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. "The vice president has agreed... to lead our diplomatic effort and work with those nations to accept the returnees and enhance migration enforcement at their borders and we are already talking with Mexico about that," he said. In an interaction with reporters before his meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on this issue, Biden said his administration is going to be dealing with a full team. "I (can) think of nobody who is better qualified to do this than... this is a woman who ran the second-largest attorney general's office in America after the United States attorney general in the State of California," he said about Harris. In her remarks, Harris said there are many factors that lead residents to leave these countries. "While we are clear that people should not come to the border now. We also understand that we will enforce the law...," she said. Harris stressed addressing "the root causes that cause people to make the trek, as the president has described, to come here". "I look forward to engaging in diplomacy with government, with the private sector, with civil society and the leaders of each in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to strengthen democracy and the rule of law and ensure shared prosperity in the region. We will collaborate with Mexico and other countries throughout the Western Hemisphere and as part of this effort, we expect that we will have collaborative relationships to accomplish the goals the president has and that we share," she said. According to the White House, the vice president's leadership on this issue will focus both on the goal of stemming the flow of irregular migrants to the United States and on the establishment of a longer-term strategic partnership with these countries based on respect and shared values. "We need to deal with what's happening in the Northern Triangle and address it in a way that is about not only diplomacy, but bringing our allies together," Harris said. The vice president will oversee diplomatic efforts and work with these nations to accept returnees and enhance migration enforcement on their borders, implement the strategy to address the root causes of migration and work to create economic prosperity, fight corruption, improve good governance and strengthen the rule of law. In addition, Harris will work closely with various Cabinet members, including the Secretary of State and the Administrator for International Development, as well as the Special Envoy for the Northern Triangle. She will also engage with civil society, international organisations and governments in the region to build, strengthen, and expand Central and North American countries' asylum systems and resettlement capacity and increase opportunities for vulnerable populations to apply for protection closer to home. Meanwhile, the Department of Defence approved a request for assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to temporarily house unaccompanied migrant children at a vacant dormitory at Joint Base San Antonio – Lackland, Texas and an area of land on Fort Bliss, Texas to construct a suitable temporary housing facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-puts-vp-harris-in-charge-of-border-influx/articleshow/81676223.cms||---

The HC is likely to hear his appeal on Thursday. Akbar has challenged the findings and observations made against him that were recorded by the trial court in its order while acquitting Ramani. Akbar’s plea is listed before Justice Mukta Gupta in which he has assailed the trial court order. The ex-minister’s appeal questions the logic of the trial court in the ruling against him even though it admits that the content cited by him is “defamatory in nature”. The trial court had also rejected Ramani’s argument that only a part of her article in a magazine referred to the former editor. The trial court had, however, found prima facie merit in her claim that Akbar harassed her and noted that a woman has the right to put grievances before any platform of her choice even after decades. The trial court had dismissed the complaint filed by Akbar, saying that no charges were proved against Ramani. It had also observed it is shameful that crimes against women are taking place in a country where mega epics like Mahabharata and Ramayana were written about respecting them. Ramani had made allegations of sexual misconduct against Akbar in the wake of #MeToo movement in 2018. Akbar had filed the complaint against Ramani on October 15 that year for allegedly defaming him by accusing him of sexual misconduct decades ago. Two days after filing the complaint, he had resigned as a Union minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/metoo-mj-akbar-moves-hc-against-ramani-acquittal-order/articleshow/81677352.cms||---

The terror act is against the community as a whole,” the officer said. The sections invoked can attract life imprisonment. The NIA had earlier invoked the Explosives Substances Act, among other sections. The ATS probe so far has reportedly found that the plot to kill Hiran was hatched on March 2 during a two-hour meeting Waze held with two of his colleagues at the police HQ.

During the interrogation of arrested constable Vinayak Shinde (51), it transpired that Waze was communicating with him with a SIM card procured from Gujarat,” an official said. “At 7pm, Waze left the police commissioner’s office and reached Thane around 8.20pm and called Hiran. We believe that Waze himself called Hiran but told him to inform his wife that one inspector Tawde had called.

---||India||SC wants govt to check misuse of electoral bonds||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved its verdict on a plea to stay issuance of electoral bonds, scheduled for 10 days from April 1, even as the Election Commission said it supported the mechanism for donations to political parties but wanted more transparency by revealing the identity of donors. “We do not know who has the solution to stop black money,” said a bench led by CJI Bobde, adding it was worried about anonymous donations through electoral bonds getting misused by political parties, which could use the funds so received for disruptive activities. “Can the government look into devising a mechanism to check the misuse of funds received through electoral bonds for illegal purposes,” it asked attorney general K K Venugopal and solicitor general Tushar Mehta. The bench also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian reserved order on a plea filed by an NGO after its counsel Prashant Bhushan said electoral bonds were a tool to inject black money into electoral politics. Bhushan said RBI and the EC had strongly opposed it by arguing that these would increase the role of black money in elections. However, Bhushan was countered by the CJI, who read out from documents filed by the lawyer to say that RBI was agreeable to electoral bonds if they were operated in demat format rather than as scrips. It asked Bhushan whether he could explain the difference between demat and scrip, to which the counsel expressed inability. However, Bhushan repeatedly said electoral bonds would increase the role of black money in elections and its issuance from April 1, ahead of assembly elections, needed to be stayed. Venugopal said the government learnt its lessons after the bad experience of bearer bonds. "Now, all payments for purchase of electoral bonds, which has a small lifespan within which the political party should encash it, must be made through demand drafts, cheques or bank transfers, thus bringing the transaction into the open for scrutiny. Moreover, the SC in its March 27, 2019, order had asked all political parties to submit details of donations received through electoral bonds to the Election Commission in sealed cover. So, there is little chance of black money being used as donations to political parties," he said. Mehta said electoral bonds were not transferable and hence could not be purchased by one and used for donation by another. The EC, through senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, said, "The EC is supporting electoral bonds and not opposing them. Without electoral bonds, donations used to be made to political parties through hard cash, enhancing the chances of use of black money in elections. However, the commission favours more transparency and wants the name of donors as well as the amount donated to be made public."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-wants-govt-to-check-misuse-of-electoral-bonds/articleshow/81677385.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Noida||Supreme Court seeks fresh offer to take over Jaypee Infra||NEW DELHI: The insolvency proceedings against real estate company Jaypee Infratech, which was initiated way back in 2017, is going to be further delayed with the Supreme Court on Wednesday directing that fresh proposal be sought to take over the debt-ridden firm in which more than 20,000 homebuyers invested money and are waiting anxiously for resolution of the legal dispute. The resolution plan submitted by NBCC (India) Limited was approved by the Committee of Creditors in December 2019 by a vast majority of over 97% of voting share of the financial creditors and the PSU was all set to take over the company to complete the unfinished housing projects in NCR. But it was opposed by various parties, including some creditors, and the legal dispute finally reached the apex court which was the third round of litigation in the court on insolvency proceedings pertaining to Jaypee. After holding extensive hearings and considering the pleas of all stakeholders, a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna directed the Interim Resolution Professional to complete the proceedings within 45 days. "We direct the IRP to complete the CIRP within the extended time of 45 days from today. For this purpose, it will be open to the IRP to invite modified/fresh resolution plans only from Suraksha Realty and NBCC respectively, giving them time to submit the same within 2 weeks from the date of this judgment. It is made clear that the IRP shall not entertain any expression of interest by any other person nor shall be required to issue any new information memorandum," said Justice Maheshwari who authored the judgement for the bench. The court said the course which is being adopted is for the complex and peculiar features of this case but this repeat exercise concerning the CIRP of JIL cannot be an unending process and needs to be taken to its logical conclusion. This court also took note of the fact that there was unanimity among all the parties that liquidation of JIL must be eschewed and an attempt be made to salvage the situation by finding out some viable arrangement which could subserve the interests of all concerned. In its 375-page voluminous judgement, the apex court also ruled that there is no scope for the adjudicating authority to interfere with the commercial aspects of the decision of the CoC. "If, within its limited jurisdiction, the adjudicating authority finds any shortcoming in the resolution plan vis-à-vis the specified parameters, it would only send the resolution plan back to the Committee of Creditors, for re-submission after satisfying the parameters delineated by the Code and exposited by this court," the court said. In a relief to Jaypee’s parent company, Jaiprakash Associates, the bench quashed the company law tribunal order which held that Rs 750 crore deposited by it in the apex court would not be refunded and would go to the account of the insolvent company. "We have also disapproved the decision of the Adjudicating Authority in relation to the said amount of INR 750 crore with accrued interest and have held that this amount is the property of JAL and the stipulations in the resolution plan concerning its usage by JIL or the resolution applicant cannot be approved. However, the final treatment of the said amount of INR 750 crore with accrued interest shall be determined by NCLT after the reconciliation of accounts between JAL and JIL," the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/sc-seeks-fresh-offer-to-take-over-jaypee-infra/articleshow/81677361.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The last time the country had surpassed this tally was on October 23 when 54,350 cases were recorded. However, unlike in the second half of October, when the first wave was receding after having peaked on September 17, this time around the pandemic is surging rapidly. On September 17, the peak of the first wave in India, the daily count was just around 2,000 cases short of the one-lakh mark. For the second consecutive day, the daily Covid toll breached the 200-mark with 248 victims succumbing to the virus on Wednesday. The toll was lower than the previous day’s figure of 276. On October 23 — when the cases were just about 1,000 more than March 24 — the day’s toll was 665. However, the active cases on October 23 stood at 6,86,792 and during the second half of October they were decreasing rapidly with each passing day as the number of patients getting discharged was outnumbering new cases. In contrast, active cases now have been rising at a very fast pace and stood at 3,96,889 on March 24. The last six days have seen an increase in active cases by a whopping one lakh.

---||India||Bobde endorses Ramana for CJI as SC junks Jagan’s plaint||NEW DELHI: A month before his retirement, Chief Justice of India S A Bobde on Wednesday recommended senior-most Supreme Court judge Justice N V Ramana to the Centre as the next CJI. In the process, Bobde dismissed an unprecedented complaint against Ramana submitted by Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy after an in-house inquiry held the accusation to be “false, frivolous, baseless, motivated” false and an attempt to “browbeat” the judiciary. In his letter to Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Bobde said Ramana was eminently suitable and fit to be appointed the next CJI, the first from Andhra Pradesh and the second Telugu to head the country’s judiciary after K Subba Rao. Ramana will take oath as the 48th CJI on April 24. TOI learnt the CJI and two other senior judges examined Reddy’s complaint threadbare, the charges being two-fold — that Justice Ramana's two daughters had bought land in Amaravati, the proposed capital of Andhra Pradesh, for a song even before the notification for the future capital was issued, and that Justice Ramana had a stranglehold over the Andhra Pradesh judiciary which was passing adverse orders against the Reddy government. The two judges gave lengthy written opinions on the complaint and termed the charges “false, frivolous, baseless, motivated" and said these were levelled to "browbeat the judge" who was heading a bench which had passed orders to expedite snail-paced criminal trials against sitting and former MPs/MLAs. Documents perused by TOI showed that Justice Ramana's daughters, like many others, bought land in Amaravati area in June 2015 from a local property dealer more than a year after then Union minister Panabaka Lakshmi in February 2014 announced Amaravati as the new capital. When he takes oath, Justice Ramana will be the second Telugu to head the judiciary. The figures of Justices Rao and Ramana are a contrast. Justice Rao was born in a wealthy advocate family and his father-in-law was a judge of Madras HC. Rao enrolled as an advocate in Madras HC in 1926 and was appointed as its judge in March 1948. After Andhra Pradesh was formed, Justice Rao was appointed its chief justice in July 1954. He was appointed to the SC in January 1958 and became CJI on June 30, 1966. Nine months into his tenure as CJI, Justice Rao resigned to contest the presidential election as a united opposition candidate, the first CJI to do so. He was defeated by Congress's Zakir Hussain, but earned laurels by getting 44% of the vote. Justice Ramana was born in an agricultural family on August 27, 1957, in Ponnavaram village in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh. He enrolled as an advocate on February 10, 1983, and practised in Andhra Pradesh HC and the SC in civil, criminal, constitutional, labour, service and election matters and specialised in constitutional, criminal and service laws and laws relating to inter-state river water disputes. He was appointed as a permanent judge of Andhra Pradesh HC on June 27, 2000. He was appointed chief justice of Delhi HC on September 2, 2013 and became a judge of the SC on February 17, 2014. Being the executive chairman of National Legal Services Authority for the last one and a half years, Justice Ramana has focused on providing speedy justice to citizens and is determined to provide meaningful access to justice to the downtrodden, poor, women and children in distress. Outlining his views, he said, "The idea of access to justice is deeply embedded in the constitutional vision of justice. Legal aid is an important element in ensuring that access to justice is available to all people, irrespective of their social or economic position. The concept of access to justice in India is much broader than confining it to providing lawyers for representation before the courts. It includes increasing legal awareness and also providing legal assistance to the poor and the marginalised for actualisation of their rights and entitlements."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bobde-endorses-ramana-for-cji-as-sc-junks-jagans-plaint/articleshow/81678132.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||RS approves Delhi govt bill amid opposition walkout||NEW DELHI: Amid loud protests, a heated debate and walkouts by opposition parties, the NCT of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was approved by the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday by an 83-45 vote, establishing primacy of the lieutenant governor in the Capital, which is a Union Territory with a legislature. Passed by the Lok Sabha on March 22, the Bill is set to be law once the President approves the legislation and it is notified. The Bill was passed by a voice-vote, but a division was sought before it went through. No member abstained from voting after a fractious debate where the opposition accused the Centre of undercutting the Delhi legislature and BJP leaders responding that the Bill settled a persistent ambiguity in the roles of the LG and the city government. The law, which may face a fresh legal challenge, establishes the status of the LG as in any other UT, equating the ‘government’ in Delhi with the LG. The proposed law is a blow to AAP’s campaign for full statehood for Delhi. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal vehemently opposed the Bill. The debate in the Rajya Sabha, which saw 17 members participate, began with protests and MPs storming the well and calling it unconstitutional. This resulted in two back-to-back adjournments soon after the Bill was taken up for discussion. Opposition parties demanded that the Bill be referred to a select committee and dissent was registered by Congress, AAP, SP, RJD, DMK, BJD, TMC, YSRCP, CPM, Shiv Sena, SAD, TDP and NCP. While parties like BJD, YSRCP and SP walked out after registering their dissent, Congress, led by leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge, exited the House after division of votes was declared. The Bill states that it will promote harmonious relations between the legislature and the executive, and further define the responsibilities of the elected government and the LG, in line with the constitutional scheme of governance of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, as interpreted by the Supreme Court. The objects and reasons of the Bill said the SC’s interpretation that the city government need not obtain the LG’s “concurrence” on every issue of day-to-day governance was the rationale for the legislation as the amendments look to end the “ambiguity” and “uncertainty” in the current legislative framework. BJP speakers like Bhupender Yadav pointed to committees being set up which were in the manner of inquiries and which exceed the brief of even Lok Sabha panels. However, AAP member Sanjay Singh, who protested vehemently, described these amendments as “unconstitutional” and an attempt to “finish the role of the elected government in Delhi”. Congress member Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued that the Bill sought to convert the government of Delhi to a puppet. Addressing BJP, he said, “This is not about AAP, Congress or West Bengal, these amendments hit at the root of federalism.” Countered Singhvi’s allegations, Yadav said the Bill only tried to end ambiguity of the powers and role of the LG within the constitutional provisions applying to Delhi to ensure smooth governance. Replying to the debate, junior home minister G Kishan Reddy said, “The Bill does not curtail in any manner any of the powers enjoined on the NCT of Delhi, which is provided by the Constitution of India. The bill is also not attempting any amendment of Constitution of India and is in consonance with the Supreme Court.” Countering the opposition’s allegations, Reddy said, “This 1991 law was not brought by the BJP government, it was the Congress government. If everything was fine with the law, why did we need to go to the Supreme Court and high court? The problem was that there was lack of clarity, there was ambiguity and discussions on interpretation were happening at different forums. As a government, we felt that it is our responsibility to bring in clarity. Nothing is being added to the Act that is contrary to constitutional provisions.” In a tweet on Wednesday, TMC MP Derek O'Brien had said his party MPs had rushed to the Capital to stop “bulldozing” of the bill in Rajya Sabha. He registered strong dissent against the bill in the House in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rs-approves-delhi-govt-bill-amid-opposition-walkout/articleshow/81678605.cms||---

The case has been registered against Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, an official said. The FIR was registered on March 15. According to FIR, DHFL created over 2.5 lakh fake home loan accounts in a non-existent branch purportedly located at Bandra, Mumbai between 2007-2019. The FIR alleges that the accused claimed to have sanctioned and disbursed Rs 14,000 crore worth home loans on these accounts under the PMAY scheme. Thereafter, the company allegedly deposited and routed Rs 11,755.79 crore of the loan amount to several fictitious firms, named ‘Bandra Book firms’. For these fictitious loans, DHFL received Rs 539.40 crore interest subsidy, states the FIR adding that it was to further receive an interest subsidy of Rs 1,347.80 crore from the government taking the total amount to Rs 1,887 crore. The CBI also suspects the involvement of some bank officials who are yet to be identified. The fraud came to light during an audit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cbi-books-dhfl-directors-over-fake-home-loan-accounts/articleshow/81678811.cms||Rajshekhar Jha
---||India||HC: Give Arnab 3-day notice before TRP case summons||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday allowed Mumbai police to continue the probe against Republic TV and its editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami in the TRP (television ratings point) rigging case but granted Goswami interim protection from summons/arrest without a 72-hour notice. The HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale gave these directions while admitting a plea by Goswami and ARG Outlier Media that runs all Republic channels seeking quashing of the case or transferring it to CBI, and posted it for hearing on June 28. Public prosecutor Deepak Thakre said it will complete the probe in 12 weeks. The HC accepted his statement and directed that the investigating officer should give a “clear notice of three days (excluding holidays)” in case he wants to summon Goswami. If Goswami receives such summons, “he shall appear and co-operate with the inquiry before the IO” as assured by his counsel Harish Salve last October, the HC added. The police are probing an FIR registered on October 6, 2020, about meters being rigged to induce viewers to watch particular channels. Seeking interim protection for Goswami, senior counsel Ashok Mundargi had argued mala fide intentions of the state and pointed out that despite a magistrate having closed the abetment of suicide case, the Alibag-Raigad police had arrested Goswami last year and he was released only after the Supreme Court granted him bail. During the TRP investigation “if IO has reasons to believe that he needs to take coercive action against (Goswami), he shall give clear notice of 72 hours before taking such coercive action’’ to allow him to “approach competent forum for appropriate relief”, said the HC. The interim order is granted keeping in mind the “peculiar facts and circumstances of this case”, keeping in view the “serious mala fide” alleged by them against the state and in view of Goswami’s arrest in the Anvay Naik abetment of suicide case. Mundargi also argued that under the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) there was “no concept of ‘suspect’ and that investigation and proceedings can be undertaken only against accused persons”. The court said the petition deserves to be admitted for five legal questions it raises, including whether the HC can entertain a quashing plea on the grounds of ‘serious mala fide’ and grant any interim protection if the petitioners have not been named as ‘accused’ in the FIR, and if the police can continue the probe by naming ‘owners/managers of Republic TV and persons associated’ with it as ‘suspects’ in its chargesheet. The HC said the police cannot invoke the chargesheet clause regarding ‘suspects’ to take coercive action against Goswami. Mundargi also argued that despite two chargesheets filed, there was “no material found yet against Goswami or ARG Outlier”. He submitted that the purpose of putting a ‘suspects’ clause was only to “continue to harass the petitioners with such open ended investigation, which does not seem to be culminating”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-give-arnab-3-day-notice-before-trp-case-summons/articleshow/81678845.cms||Swati Deshpande

Special CBI judge MK Nagpal summoned them on April 7. “I find sufficient material and grounds for proceeding further in the matter against all the ten accused persons named in the complaint,” the court stated. It is alleged that Karti exerted influence on Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) to prevent punitive action against M/s INX Media Pvt Ltd, which had violated the foreign exchange guidelines related to foreign direct investment. In lieu of the favour, a substantial amount was paid to the companies in which Karti had sustainable interest, directly or indirectly, the ED has alleged. According to the investigating agency’s complaint filed on June 1, 2020, Chidambaram generated proceeds of crime by granting and subsequently regularising FIPB approval to M/s INX Media Pvt. Ltd. The agency alleged that the direction to help Karti is one of the important steps of the scheme of money laundering devised by Chidambaram along with his son and close confidants. It is also alleged that the proceeds of crime generated in this case were laundered by Karti and other co-conspirators and invested in immovable and movable properties||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-court-summons-pc-karti-in-inx-case/articleshow/81678875.cms||Aamir Khan

Justice VG Arun, however, directed that no coercive proceedings, including arrest, be taken against the ED officials on the basis of Kerala police’s FIR till the court examines the matter in detail on March 30. The agency had filed a petition urging the court to quash the FIR. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor generals SV Raju and KM Nataraj represented ED’s Cochin zone deputy director P Radhakrishnan, the petitioner in the case. Citing the documents produced, Raju argued that the two women constables who gave statements about ED officials forcing Suresh into naming the CM were not even on duty on August 12 and 13, when the alleg-ed coercion took place. The FIR was filed just when court proceedings in the gold smuggling case were to begin. Senior public prosecutor Suman Chakravarthy argued that the petition filed by an ED official who wasn’t an accused in the case was not maintainable. He also said it was “unnatural” that statements of the accused in the gold smuggling case were being produced along with the petition. The court then sought to know how these documents came to be produced before it, at which additional solicitor general Raju said these had been placed before the lower court. The CPM state secretariat, meanwhile, said the allegations against the government and the assembly speaker in the gold smuggling case were part of a larger politically motivated conspiracy. While electioneering is in progress, central agencies are being used as a tool against the LDF government, it said. According to the CPM secretariat, statements that weren’t part of the 1,000-page chargesheet have been “leaked” as statements of the accused. It was only after the Kerala assembly considered the breach of privilege motion with regard to the Wadakkanchery Life Mission flat case that the ED came up with allegations against the speaker, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-hc-refuses-to-stay-polices-ed-probe/articleshow/81678896.cms||---

Hundreds of farmers and labourers joined the protest march demanding the withdrawal of the laws and demanded a legal guarantee for the purchase of crops at MSP. The protest, however, was interrupted by police near JP Golambar, where the protestors staged dharna for a couple of hours. The protest was led by the BRKS’s president Ramchandra Singh, who addressed the gathering and appealed to farmers and labourers to join the nation-wide lockdown on Friday. Singh said since January 22, the government is deliberately avoiding talks with farmers. “The PM Narendra Modi is constantly misleading the country by saying that it will be resolved soon, but he is not taking any initiative. Farmers are ready to talk to the government, but the government should clear its intention about the three agricultural laws. If the government announces the withdrawal and the legal status of the MSP, then the farmers are ready to negotiate,” he said. The BRFLU vice-president Nagendra Nath Ojha said this law was not only against the farmers but also labourers. Meanwhile, several farmers' associations and labourers in the state will join the pan-India strike on March 26. BRKS’s general secretary Ashok Singh said all activities, including transportation, business establishments, would remain shut on Friday. To intensify the protest against farm laws, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait, along with other farmer-leaders, would participate in a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Rohtas district on Thursday. Besides farm laws, issues such as rise in petrol, diesel and LPG cylinder prices among others will also be raised in the Mahapanchayat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/farmers-workers-hold-protest-march-in-city-against-farm-laws/articleshow/81676430.cms||Faryal Rumi

A source confirmed that the man has suffered from hemiparaplegia (paralysis of one side of the lower half of the body). Doctors at Sion hospital said there was nothing to outrightly suggest that the stroke was linked to the vaccination. “It could be 100% coincidental,” a doctor said. The doctor said the man had recovered and was likely to be discharged soon. “He may not regain complete movement as was prior to the attack, but he will improve,” the doctor said The man had taken the first dose of Covishield in a Chembur hospital on March 15 around 4.30 pm. He developed hemiparesis, a weakness or inability to move one side of the body, day later on March 16 and was take to Sion hospital at 6.30pm. Doctors said they would submit a detailed report to the adverse event following immunisation committee and the Centre. The administration of Covishield was halted in several European countries after reports emerged that it could cause a blood clot in rare cases. The WHO expert committee, though, ruled out such a connection and said Covishield was an efficient and safe vaccine for Covid -19. On Wednesday, Dr VK Paul, a member of NITI-Aayog (health) said experts in the country too had found no thrombosis events linked to the vaccine. “There is no signal whatsoever for this concern. It is safe.

As a mark of protest, the woman MLAs along with their male counterparts boycotted the functioning of the lower House on Wednesday and sat outside the House offering bangles to the CM. Even on Tuesday evening, Rabri had expressed her wrath over the treatment meted to the woman MLAs of opposition parties, especially former minister Anita Devi, whose saree came undone while being dragged by woman cops. The MLA described the thrashing of her opposition male colleagues and misbehaviour with woman MLAs as unprecedented. “Never in the history of this country, such an incident has occurred. We were dragged by the cops, beaten and kicked. My hair was pulled and my saree came off because of the way they dragged me. The entire episode was captured on camera. This was the treatment given to MLAs inside the assembly, imagine what the government and their goons can do to our mothers and daughters walking on the street,” Anita said. However, JD (U) state spokesperson Anjum Ara criticised Rabri for not telling the truth. “Opposition MLAs on the instruction of Tejashwi Prasad had entered the Speaker's chamber without his permission. They had mishandled the chair and crossed all limits. As far as Rabri Devi is concerned, she is the same person who had thrown her daughter-in-law out and today she is using all wrong words for women on social media,” she said. Anjum even criticised the opposition members for using bangles as a symbol of weakness. “Bangles signify our Indian culture and not weakness. But opposition MLAs have portrayed these bangles in a poor light,” Anjum added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rabri-compares-nitish-to-dhritarashtra/articleshow/81675545.cms||Sheezan Nezami

But irrespective of the lockdown’s efficacy in controlling transmission rates, it rapidly turned into a nightmare for daily wagers and workers in the unorganised sector. At least one lakh stranded overnight had to shelter in relief camps in AP for weeks, while thousands took to the highways, walking home hungry and thirsty for days on end, braving the summer heat. While the effects of the first phase were most visible for the economically weaker sections, the ensuing phases of the lockdown sounded a death knell for almost all sectors, resulting in job retrenchments and putting an end to the entrepreneurial and business dreams of lakhs of people in the state. The Andhra Pradesh government sent about 1.3 lakh migrant workers back to their native states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, etc. through various means of transportations after restrictions were eased in May 2020. The state witnessed a reverse migration of nearly one lakh people, including those who migrated to other districts within the state. Srikakulam received the highest number of migrants at about 13,000. Nearly 4,600 fishermen stranded in Veraval, Gujarat, Madh Island of Maharashtra and Malpe village in Udupi district of Karnataka were brought back in special buses. According to an official statement issued in Parliament, it has been estimated that the decision to impose a lockdown, by slowing down the spread of pandemic in India, prevented between 14 to 29 lakh cases and 37,000 to 78,000 deaths. Based on the inadequacies of the health infrastructure when the outbreak broke, experts say the lockdown might have saved the country from the severity of a magnitude that hit some Western countries. Explaining the outcomes of the lockdown in Covid-19 management, AP Covid-19 nodal officer, Dr K Rambabu said the decision successfully blunted the aggressive spread of the pandemic, despite financial hardships and other challenges. “This crucial period helped the state augment its health infrastructure for its battle against the unprecedented pandemic. For instance, dedicated oxygen beds recorded an increase of 44 times and ventilators by 20 times to what existed in March 2020. But now we cannot afford any complacency considering the recent spurt in daily case numbers,” said Dr Rambabu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/job-losses-migrant-exodus-define-a-year-of-lockdown/articleshow/81675718.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Andhra Pradesh is one of the seven states handpicked for this pilot project. Based on the outcomes in the pilot project, the NCERT would make changes in the testing patterns and other measures before advancing to the large-scale pan-India NAS that is likely to be conducted in November 2021. The NCERT has been periodically conducting the National Achievement Survey since 2001 to monitor improvement in children’s learning levels and to assess the health of the government education system as a whole. The NAS report gives a national and state-level picture, rather than scores for individual students, schools or districts. Speaking to TOI, SCERT faculty and NAS state coordinator Ch V Ramesh Kumar said that 40 schools of Visakhapatnam would be covered in the pilot. “The competencies of 405 students of classes III, V, VIII and X would be tested in a written format in this study. The question papers would be sent by the NCERT and they should be opened only in the presence of the representatives of the NCERT on the test date. As Visakhapatnam district is a mix of urban, semi-urban, rural and tribal parts, the district has been chosen for the pilot study as it may rightly represent the overall state,” said Ramesh Kumar. State assessment cell members D David and M Prasad said the pilot study would be conducted from March 25 to 27 in Visakhapatnam. “The objectives of the NAS are to identify gaps and diagnose areas that need improvement. This information can be used to impact policies and interventions for improving children’s learning,” said David. It is envisaged that over the next few years, the content of teacher professional development programmes will focus on student attainment of outcomes. For this, the outcomes of large-scale studies like NAS can be used to plan and design training and professional development programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizag-dist-chosen-for-nas-pilot-study/articleshow/81675756.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The move comes as the financially stressed construction-to-consumer durables enterprise looks to pare liabilities. On the other hand, Adani has been on an acquisition spree in the renewable energy space, having inked multiple deals amid the pandemic. The SP Group and its partner Khurshed Daruvala together owe Rs 1,200 crore to the publicly listed Sterling and Wilson Solar, for which the company had given them time till September 30 to settle the entire outstanding amount. In a letter to the Sterling board, the partners said that they will be receiving Rs 250 crore from the sale of the two solar assets and the entire amount will be transferred to the company towards repayment of part of the outstanding loans. Adani is buying a 50MW solar energy plant in Telangana and a 25MW unit, also in Telangana, from SP and Daruvala. The two solar plants, which were commissioned in late 2017, had a combined revenue of Rs 70 crore in fiscal 2020. The transaction will be concluded before the end of this fiscal, Adani’s green energy firm said in a regulatory filing. Adani Green, in which French major Total also owns a stake, will increase its operating renewable capacity to 3,470MW after the transaction is completed. After the Rs 250-crore repayment to Sterling, SP and Daruvala’s dues to the company will be reduced to Rs 950 crore. The two have been servicing the interest component and the Rs 950 crore is the principal amount. The duo said in the letter that they have put into action multiple plans to clear the dues and the proposed repayment of Rs 250 crore is the first step in that direction. SP had offered assets, including immovable properties, as security towards the pending amount. SP owns 51% of Sterling, but nearly 74% of its holding — or about 37.4% of the company — is pledged. Daruvala holds 24% of the company, which had a market cap of Rs 4,823 crore as on Wednesday. SP, whose main business is construction and real estate, has been facing a liquidity crisis precipitated by the pandemic that slowed down projects. It has a debt of over Rs 22,000 crore and has sought its restructuring under the special RBI scheme introduced following the Covid crisis. The debt-restructuring plan, among other components, includes SP selling a part of its stake in three group companies — Sterling, Eureka Forbes and Afcons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sp-will-sell-2-solar-plants-to-adani-for-rs-446cr/articleshow/81676770.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Allahabad||Allahabad HC seeks information on Dr Kafeel Khan’s plea to quash criminal case||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court on Tuesday directed the state government counsel to seek instructions from the state authorities concerned with regards to a petition moved by Dr Kafeel Khan, a paediatrician seeking to quash the chargesheet and criminal case filed against him for his alleged inflammatory speech delivered at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) during CAA protests in December 2019. Hearing a petition filed by Dr Khan, Justice JJ Munir directed to put up this petition before the court on April 6 for the next hearing. In the petition filed under section 482 (saving of inherent powers of high court) of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), Dr Khan had challenged the order passed by the chief judicial magistrate of Aligarh taking cognizance of the charge-sheet for the alleged offences under sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration) and 505 (2) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). To recall, on December 12, 2019, Dr Khan had addressed a rally at AMU which was organized in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. An FIR was lodged against him in this connection on December 13, 2019, at Aligarh police station. Later, the police investigated the matter and submitted a chargesheet against him. The CJM took cognizance of the chargesheet on July 28, 2020. Both chargesheet and cognizance order are under challenge in the present petition. In the present petition, the counsel for Dr Khan has taken the plea that the police, while lodging the FIR and chargesheet against him, has not followed proper legal procedures. It was contended that order of taking cognizance for the above mentioned offences without prior sanction from the Central or state government is without jurisdiction and is nullity in law. Further, the entire speech does not disclose hate speech and no ingredients are available to attract sections under which FIR was lodged against him. Subsequently, on February 13, 2020, Dr Khan was booked under the National Security Act (NSA) alleging that he delivered inflammatory speech in AMU during anti-CAA protests. On September 1, 2020, the Allahabad high court had set aside the detention of Dr Khan under the NSA and had directed the state government to immediately release him. In this decision, the high court had observed, “Dr Kafeel Khan’s speech does not promote hatred or violence, it gives a call for national integrity and unity among citizens.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-seeks-info-on-dr-khans-plea-to-quash-criminal-case/articleshow/81675713.cms||---

However, chief minister Nitish Kumar came down heavily on the opposition MLCs in the second half of the session and reprimanded them for their unruly behaviour. A clash-like situation occurred in the second half after opposition MLC Subodh Kumar started showing bangles to CM Nitish, after which several ruling party MLCs came to the well, standing face to face with the opposition MLCs after which opposition MLCs staged a walkout. Nitish stood at his place and angrily said ruling NDA legislators were sitting quietly in the assembly, only those from the opposition were doing hooliganism and creating ruckus and attacking the Speaker’s chair. He further said people were watching everything and will give them a proper reply. “Quietly participate in the proceedings. What is your number? And what is the number on this (NDA) side? Do you even know? Go and find out what happened yesterday?” the CM said even as the acting chairperson kept appealing to the legislators to take their seat. The first half of the session, too, witnessed an uproar after opposition MLCs demanded suspension of work and a debate on Tuesday’s incident, which was rejected. They then came to the well, sloganeering against the government. The House was adjourned within five minutes and opposition MLCs continued to sit in the well for some time and then protested outside the Council. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra while talking to media persons outside the Council said, “March 23 will be remembered as a black day in the history of the state. For the first time, legislators were dragged, thrashed and kicked inside the House. All we want is a debate on this issue.” Senior RJD MLC Ram Chandra Purbey also criticized Tuesday’s incident. However, BJP MLC Sanjay Mayukh criticized the opposition for creating ruckus in the House and not letting it function smoothly. “They have stooped too low and behaved unruly with the chair,” Mayukh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oppn-mlcs-create-uproar-in-council/articleshow/81675577.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Kolkata||Candidates use ‘star’ skills against trolls||Kolkata: They may be new to politics, but the stars contesting the Assembly election are veterans of handling social media trolls — at times even better than many seasoned politicians. While they unanimously said they ignore trolls, when their followers become abusive on social media, they even block them. Some celebs, however, pointed out that blocking an individual seldom gives them any reprieve since they are back with another profile, and with more aggressive language. Papiya Adhikari — a popular face on Bengali television — tries to defuse the intense conversations with humour. “I am extremely patient and deal with the trolls with a calm attitude,” she said. Actor Payel Sarkar, who recently joined BJP and is contesting against Ratna Chatterjee from Behala East, has corrected trolls with logic and data. “If the discussions maintain the decorum of a social media platform, and if the person engages in writing comments by citing false data, then my team has tried to rectify and respond with facts. But, in most cases, the trolls are vicious people and their intention is to vilify us. As actors, we are soft targets,” she said. Actor Kanchan Mullick of Trinamool, who will take on BJP’s Prabir Ghosal from Uttarpara constituency, faced trolling after he decided to join politics. “They can never take away my achievements. I have a strong presence on social media and I interact with my voters and followers there,” Mullick said. Rudranil Ghosh, who joined BJP in Delhi, at Amit Shah’s residence in January, said he had never countered trolls. “It is their personal choice. Many people on social media react without going into the depth of an incident. I prefer to engage in conversations even with those who hold an opposing political ideology and counter them with reason and logic,” Ghosh said. He added that the trolls lack courage. Though there have been cases of a police complaint filed by actors against abusive trolls online, some actors explained that the social media fan pages have a policy laid down by the team. Thus, when the language becomes abusive, bullying is incessant and threats are issued, many followers are immediately reminded of the established policy, turn off the comment section and screen the members before allowing them access to the private group page. Actor Saayoni Ghosh, the Trinamool candidate from Asansol South, said, “In the recent past, I chose not to respond to the trolls. Right now, my focus is on campaigning and winning the election for my party,” she said. The actor had earlier complained to the cyber cell when death and rape threats were made against her. Koushani Mukherjee, who debuted with the movie ‘Parbona Ami Chartey Tokey’ in 2015, is fighting the assembly elections on the Trinamool ticket from Krishnanagar Uttar, rued that actors often face trolling because people refuse to respect their privacy. “When they become abusive on the social media platforms, I do not respond to them,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/candidates-use-star-skills-against-trolls/articleshow/81676215.cms||Somdatta Basu
---||Kolkata||Wary revellers stay away from colour markets||Kolkata: Holi is just around the corner, yet there is a sudden slump in demand for colours, abir and accessories in wholesale hubs like Burrabazar and Old China Bazar. The reason clearly is the rise in Covid cases, which has already forced several organisations and residents’ associations to scrap Holi celebrations. KMC has also advised housing societies to avoid any gathering in their complexes. The situation was different even a week ago. The jump in sales held a lot of promise for a good year ahead for traders. “We thought our sale will exceed than that of pre-Covid days of 2019,” said Samiran Pal, a wholesale trader in Burrabazar, who sells 14-15 quintal of colour and abir every year. The sellers deal in crackers during Diwali, X-mas trees, Santa caps during Christmas and colours and abir during Holi. According to traders, while the first two festivals were already marred by Covid, they had hoped to bounce back during Holi. But the rising numbers meant they are staring at further loss. “Leave apart retailers, even stray customers who used to buy accessories from us on their way home are not stepping into the market this year. We have already halved the prices but still there are no takers,” said Old China Bazar businessman Panchdeo Pandey, who sells a variety of sprinklers and balloons. However, the pre-booking of abir by political parties for May 2, the day of poll results, holds a lot of hope. “During the Left regime, there was dominance of red abir. After that green abir played a lead role with the Trinamool leading from the front. This time, the demand for green and saffron is almost equal, hinting a very tough competition,” said Babulal Manot, wholesale trader at Burrabazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wary-revellers-stay-away-from-colour-markets/articleshow/81676226.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The monthly trust board meeting was held in the temple’s board meeting hall in the city on Wednesday and 36 key resolutions were approved. Trust board chairman Paila Sominaidu said that they have focused on improving facilities for devotees. The trust board allocated the maximum amount to development works and the master plan. Protective wall construction and safety measures to prevent landslides were given top priority in the annual budget. “Kanaka Durga temple is the most well-known landmark in the city, and hence we have decided to construct arches in major junctions across the city. Best architects will design these arches. Similarly, ‘Boddu Bomma’ will be relocated to its actual place as he is considered the ‘Dwarapalaka’ for the city,” Sominaidu said. The trust board has also decided to request Indian Railways to name any train passing through Vijayawada as Kanaka Durga Express. With ‘Anna Danam’ discontinued at the temple due to rising cases of Covid-19, the trust board decided to distribute 5,000 food packets to the needy and devotees every day. “Safety of the pilgrims is the top priority. We are strictly following Covid-19 guidelines and maintaining physical distance in queues and other places. We have stalled special darshan in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple and are providing ordinary darshan for devotees to prevent congestion,” executive officer Suresh Babu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/devpt-works-corner-highest-portion-of-durga-temple-budget/articleshow/81675774.cms||Venu Lanka

As people remained cooped inside the homes following lockdown and wide-scale restrictions in its aftermath, mental ill-health also took a toll. Four major cities of Gujarat — Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot — saw 150 more suicides between October, 2019, and September 2020, as per the data tabled in the Gujarat assembly. In fact, Vadodara recorded the highest jump of 22% where 269 persons ended their lives in the same period against 219 in 2018-19. Ahmedabad city saw a jump of 10% in suicides as 791 persons ended their lives. Across Gujarat, 7,508 persons committed suicide in 2019-20, three more than 7,505 persons who ended their lives in the same period in 2018-19. Of the total suicides, 2,288 took place in the four major cities. Ahmedabad also reported 331 attempted suicide cases, which were a five-year high, as compared to 218 attempts to end life recorded in 2015-16. More alarmingly, the city saw 29 students ending their lives between October 2019 and September 2020 as against as against 18 in 2018-19. This was also highest in past five years. Overall, 51 students ended their lives in the four major cities of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot during this period. Anju Sheth of Saath Suicide Helpline said lockdown adversely impacted mental health of people. “During and post-lockdown, there was an average 20-25% rise in mental disorders, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder cases, phobia and isolation. Many people battled severe financial crisis. Education and family life due to constant run-in with family members also led to mental discord. I feel the number of attempted suicides would be higher than reported as many do not report it fearing stigma,” said Sheth. She feared that the worst may not be over. “As third wave of coronavirus engulfs the state, uncertainty over jobs, education and health is far from over,” Sheth added. Pravin Valera of Jeevan Aastha helpline said they saw calls on the helpline double after Covid-19 struck. Women and children are worst affected. "Students have experienced unprecedented uncertainty, anxiety and depression due to online education. Students also battle stress due to lack of smart phones for education and constantly staying at home under strict eye of parents and elders," said Valera. Valera says that the suicides of celebrities like actor Sushant Rajput Singh also led to copy-cat suicides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/4-major-guj-cities-record-7-spike-in-suicides-in-covid-year/articleshow/81676417.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Business||PSU banks to get Rs 19k cr Bhushan windfall this week||MUMBAI: Public sector banks are in for a windfall this week with JSW Steel set to close the Bhushan Power and Steel acquisition for Rs 19,350 crore. As the loan has already been fully provided for by lenders, the amount will add to their bottom lines for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. Although JSW had won the bid for Bhushan Power and Steel in 2019, the transaction was pending because of litigation. The Supreme Court recently paved a way for the transaction to get through by directing lenders to return money to JSW in case the enforcement authorities attached Bhushan’s assets. Banks had classified the loan as a fraudulent one after the Enforcement Directorate attached assets worth over Rs 4,000 crore as part of its money laundering probe against the former promoters of Bhushan. Lenders have claims of over Rs 47,000 crore, against which they are to receive Rs 19,350 crore. The biggest gainer will be SBI, which is owed about Rs 9,800 crore. Against this, around Rs 4,000 crore of recovery is expected. PNB will get about Rs 4,000 crore after including the claims of erstwhile Oriental Bank of Commerce and United bank of India. Other major recipients are Canara Bank (approximately Rs 1,600 crore) and Union Bank of India (Rs 1,500 crore). For public sector banks, this recovery is expected to offset any additional provisioning that could arise because of the Supreme Court order lifting the stay on classifying defaults during Covid as non-performing assets. This would also make up for any outgo that these banks might have to bear towards payment of interest on the interest that they have to compensate borrowers for the lockdown period in terms of the Supreme Court order. JSW is expected to fund the acquisition through debt. This debt, in turn, will increase the loan book of banks and enable them to show growth in advances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/psu-banks-to-get-rs-19k-cr-bhushan-windfall-this-wk/articleshow/81676555.cms||---

This will reduce the 30-day morbidity and mortality, reveals an international study on surgery conducted by the University of Birmingham and funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).World’s largest-ever Covid surgical collaborative international team of researchers led by experts at Birmingham published its findings on Wednesday in BJS – the British Journal of Surgery and the European Journal of Surgery. “As we are experiencing our second wave of Covid-19 and have now made vaccines available, it will make sense for surgeons to insist on vaccination for elective surgery patients. This will decrease morbidity and lead to safe surgery,” said Dr Vishal Bhende, paediatric cardiac surgeon at Shree Krishna Hospital (SKH), Karamsad. Bhende, along with onco surgeon Dr Raghunandan, and a team of six junior doctors from SKH — Dr Hardil Majmudar, Dr Tanishq Sharma, Dr Shivang Amin, Dr Saptak Mankad, Sohilkhan Pathan, Rohit Kumar — were part of this global study. Study was carried out with collaborative efforts of 56 hospitals of India and 1,667 hospitals of 116 countries including Australia, Brazil, China, India, UAE, the UK and USA.As per the study, between 0.6% and 1.6% patients develop Covid infection after elective surgery. This particularly applies to those over 70 and those undergoing surgery for cancer. Based on the high risks surgical patients face, scientists have calculated that vaccination is more likely to prevent Covid-19 related deaths than vaccines given to general population. “This could be particularly important for low and middle-income countries where mitigation measures such as nasal swab screening and Covid-free surgical pathways are unlikely to be universally implemented,” the study states. “Vaccination is also likely to decrease post-operative pulmonary complications,” it states. “Restarting elective surgery is a global priority. Over 15,000 surgeons and anaesthetists from 116 countries contributed to this study, making it the largest ever scientific collaboration. It is crucial that policy makers use the data we have collected. Covid vaccination should be prioritised for surgery patients ahead of general population,” said co-lead author Dr Dmitri Nepogodiev from University of Birmingham.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vaccinate-surgery-patients-on-priority-to-cut-risks/articleshow/81676301.cms||Prashant Rupera

The board has suggested an action plan to curb growing incidents of crime against women passengers on priority. According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, railways has decided to keep a close vigil on the suspects and allow railway security personnel to visit vulnerable spots on regular basis in and around the railway station premises. However, railways has proposed to install more CCTV cameras and light masts at each vulnerable place under the long term plan, he said. Besides, railways is to provide proper lightings inside circulating areas, parking slots, foot overbridges, approach roads, railway yards, washing pits and maintenance depots he said, adding railways has decided to demolish isolated and abandoned structures so that criminals do not make these places as their hideouts. In another major decision, railways has decided to allow entry of passengers inside waiting rooms only after proper check. Railway staff on duty must wear their identity cards. Railways has strictly warned against use of alcohol and smoking on railway premises and running trains. Delinquent passengers would be forwarded to jail as per railway laws, the CPRO said, adding ‘meri saheli’, a wing of RPF women team, has been deployed at all major stations in the wake of Holi festive season. Besides, ECR has started a cell for women safety and launched the numbers 09771425718/09760534063 for that purpose. Women passengers could dial either on this number in case of any problem facing them on running trains or on railway platforms. Altogether 42 women constables headed by nine women sub-inspectors have been deployed at all major stations, including Patna Junction, sources said, adding that 400 long-distance mail and express trains passing or originating from ECR jurisdiction were being escorted by both RPF and GRP men during the pre-lockdown period. Railways has also displayed the numbers of RPF and GRP officials in a few long-distance trains to contact them in any emergency. “Mock drills are being held frequently to check alertness of railway security personnel during night train escort duty,” an RPF official of Danapur said. To provide assistance to women on railway platforms, railways has set up helpline booths at Patna Junction and other stations. These helpline booths are being managed by woman RPF constables on platforms, sources said, adding long distance special passenger trains originating from Patna Junction and Rajendra Nagar Terminal are now under strict surveillance of the RPF and GRP personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rlys-beefs-up-security-to-women-passengers/articleshow/81675627.cms||Kumod Verma

The council chairman said that petitioner Buddha Venakteswara Rao of TDP and his counsel have failed to put forth arguments before him in support of their petition. “The petitioner did not show any valid reason as to why the disqualification petition could not be dismissed,” the chairman said regretting that the petitioner had failed to attend the hearing of the case several times. The chairman said that MLC Buddha Venkateswara Rao had given a representation on January 22, 2020 seeking the disqualification of MLC Sivanatha Reddy for violation of the party whip in voting in the council. However, the chairman said that the petitioner failed to show the party’s whip circulated to the members. The chairman said that Sivanatha Reddy had claimed that there was no written whip to the MLCs on a particular day and challenged Buddha Venkateswara Rao’s claim of the party whip and the request for his disqualification. Sivanatha Reddy challenged that he was nominated to the council by governor and he did not belong to TDP as claimed by the petitioner. He further claimed that the disqualification did not apply to him even if a party whip was issued. Council chairman Shariff said that petitioner Buddha Venkateswara Rao or his counsel were not available to the office of the chairman for correspondence.

Covering every nook and corner of the city, they will sensitize people to the importance of wearing face masks at public places. During the event, the DM urged Patnaites to maintain social distancing, use sanitizers and wash hands regularly. He directed the officials of all the circles under the Patna Municipal Corporation to ensure that the awareness campaign was carried out uninterrupted. E-rickshaws playing audio messages will run in Azimabad, Bankipore, Kankerbagh, New Capital, Patliputra and Patna City circles from 1pm to 9pm. The remaining three will operate in Danapur, Khagaul and Phulwarisharif. They will also keep tabs on the locals and ensure that they abide by the safety protocols. The DM said, “Covid-19 cases are on a rise in Patna. Since remaining cautious is the only way to keep the virus at bay, people need to be vigilant and follow the safety measures strictly.” He added, “Altogether eight teams have been formed to carry out an intensive mask checking drive at public places like shops, malls, and vegetable markets. The authorities concerned have also been instructed to seal such establishments that violate the Covid safety guidelines.” Admn buckles up to contain virus spread: With thousands of people returning home from other states for Holi celebrations and a sudden spike in the number of active cases, the Patna district administration is taking several steps to contain the spread of coronavirus. Covid-19 testing has been ramped up at the Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport, Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Danapur station as well as Bankipore and Mithapur bus stands. Testing and vaccination facilities have also been launched at the primary health centres and subdivisional and referral hospitals.

Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy chaired a review meeting on the vaccination drive here at the camp office on Wednesday. The chief minister directed the officials to start the vaccination process in urban areas from March 29 as the civic polls are over. He also asked the officials to take up the drive for four days in a week in each mandal on a pilot basis, covering two villages on each day. The chief minister also emphasised on the concept of village doctor and directed the authorities to implement it at the earliest. He ordered the authorities to make sure there is no shortage of doctors in primary health care centres. “While each mandal should have two PHCs, two physicians should be deployed in each PHC. Similarly, each mandal should have two 104 vehicles with one doctor in each vehicle,” he said. The chief minister asked the officials to hire doctors as per the requirement and directed officials of the finance department not to be negligent in disbursing the required funds. Officials explained that as many as 3.97 lakh health and frontline workers and 59.08 lakh people who are either 60 years and above or suffering from comorbidities are yet to be vaccinated. They said the Union government has decided to provide the vaccine to all those aged 45 and above from April 1. The officials said that the number of cases in schools is very low compared and added that if any student tested positive, the school would reopen only after all students underwent Covid-19 testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/stepping-up-vaccine-drive-govt-targets-1-cr-inoculations-in-5-wks/articleshow/81675728.cms||---

But in the remaining 105 smaller private Covid hospitals, just 50% bed occupancy has been recorded despite the daily number of new positive cases rising by 1,000 to 2,000.Speaking to TOI, Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav said the Covid patients who can afford the rates are choosing treatment at the bigger private hospitals. Moreover, many people in the city are still unaware that the smaller hospitals are also providing equally good Covid treatment. “To create awareness, we have decided to print 5 lakh pamphlets with the names and telephone numbers of all Covid hospitals across the city. The pamphlets will be distributed in residential areas,” said Jadhav. “Often, people don’t know hospital closest to them. These pamphlets will help the residents to find nearby Covid hospitals,” he said. There are a 4,330 Covid beds, in three categories, at civic and private hospitals in the city. These include 800 beds in dedicated Covid hospitals (DCHs), 105 in dedicated Covid healthcare centres (DCHCs) and 900 in the two Covid care centers of the NMC.The eight DCHs include five big private hospitals. The the remaining three are the civic and government hospitals. Around 99% of the beds in DCHs category have been occupied. On the contrary, there are 2,620 beds in 105 DCHCs, including 87% of the beds for Covid patients (oxygen, ICU and ventilators). But only 43% of the beds in 105 DCHCs are occupied. There are two CCCs with capacity of 900 beds. Of which, 70% beds are occupied.The NMC has already started a centralized bed reservation system (CBRS) for online allocation of beds. “We prefer hospitals that are near the patients’ homes. The beds are allocated through the CBRS,” said Rajendra Trimbake, the NMC officiating medical superintendent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/50-covid-beds-available-in-smaller-nashik-city-hosps/articleshow/81784353.cms||Tushar Pawar

Doctors also cautioned against multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB, especially for immunocompromised patients, such as those with diabeties, HIV and cancer. On average, around 15% of TB cases are MDR in India. Pulmonologist and civil surgeon at ESI Hospital Dr Phanender Ketha said, “TB is transmitted through droplets, which can spread when an infected person coughs, talks, sneezes, laughs or sings. The TB-causing bacteria can be present in everyone but those who have a strong immunity can resist the infection and transmission. The pandemic has been a blessing in disguise because most people wore masks and observed physical distance to save themselves from the coronavirus. Indirectly, this helped in reducing the infection rate. The annual decline of TB in the developed world has been seven per cent in the last one year.” “However, patients with comorbidities like diabetes and HIV are prone to transmitting tuberculosis due to their poor immunity. In fact, the risk of HIV patients contracting TB increases seven-fold. MDR TB can occur in patients who take inadequate and erratic drug doses and do not adhere to the prescribed treatment. Additionally, it may happen if the bacteria mutates and offers natural resistance to the drugs. Drug Resistance Sensitivity Testing can find out if a particular TB patient is resistant to drugs and accordingly, the medicines can be changed,” added Dr Phanender. District TB control officer Dr N Vasundhara said, “While it is true that wearing masks and social distancing measures will help to some extent in checking tuberculosis transmission, we also will have to take into account the pandemic shortfall in 2020. Due to the focus on Covid-19 and lockdown, testing was far less compared to other years and as a result, number of new cases registered was also less. Therefore, we cannot come to a definite conclusion unless we observe the trend of low transmission rate continuing this year as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/pandemic-yr-lowered-tb-transmission-rates/articleshow/81675742.cms||Sulogna Mehta

One of them, Mamta Kumari from Panapur in Saran district, told this newspaper, “I have been waiting for my turn to submit the application form. Now, I am not sure if I will be able to catch a bus to Panapur.” Meanwhile, in view of the applicants’ plight, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad member Rajani Kant Singh requested vice-chancellor Faruque Ali for a deadline extension.

Alok was the station house officer of the Town police station in Gopalganj under Khajurbanni was under his jurisdiction. Altogether 19 people had lost their lives and two became permanently blind after consuming poisonous liquor. All police personnel posted there were suspended after the incident. Alok’s reinstatement order was given by the bench of Justice Anil Kumar Upadhyay. The bench also ordered for giving full salary and other emoluments for the period during which he remained out of service. On Tuesday, the same bench had ordered forthwith reinstatement of four constables, namely Murali Yadav, Pushpendra Ojha, Shailendra Singh and Dineshwar Prasad Yadav. Senior counsel YV Giri, assisted by Sanjay Kumar Giri, had appeared in both the matters for the petitioners while counsel Saroj Kumar Sharma represented the state government. Till now, the high court has reinstated 20 out of the 29 dismissed police personnel, who were posted at the Town police station when the hooch tragedy took place. They were dismissed on June 15, 2020. Petitions of sub-inspector Dilkash Kumar Singh and constable Rahul Kumar, who are also among the dismissed personnel, are presently pending for hearing before the bench of Justice Mohit Kumar Shah while rest of the matters are before other benches. It was the bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh, who had first ordered immediate reinstatement of five police personnel on January 6 this year. The bench had set aside the DGP’s dismissal order, terming it as illegal. The court had also observed that superior officers just completed formality by taking disciplinary action possibly to contain public anger and uproar. “No effort at all was made in right earnest to take disciplinary action against erring officials/personnel. The charges were framed on presumption of knowledge of the police personnel regarding the illegal activities going on in the village concerned,” the court had observed. Later, on February 4, the bench of Justice Ashutosh Kumar also ordered reinstating of 10 more dismissed police personnel in the same case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-reinstates-cop-dismissed-in-khajurbanni-hooch-case/articleshow/81675401.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||First day of Maoist bandh passes off peacefully||PATNA: The first day of two-day bandh called by CPI (Maoist) passed off peacefully in state as the security personnel remained on high alert in the Maoist-affected areas, especially Gaya. It was in Maunbar village of Gaya district where the CRPF had neutralised four alleged Maoist commanders on March 16. Three AK-47 assault rifles and one INSAS rifle were recovered from the encounter site under the Dumaria police station area. The bandh has been called in Bihar and Jharkhand to protest and take revenge for the killings of their four commanders. There are 16 Maoist-affected districts in the state, as per Union ministry of home affairs. When asked, ADG (operation) Sushil Mansingh Khopde on Wednesday said security forces were on alert in all strategic areas and the locations of vital installations. “Not a single incident has been reported from anywhere across the state till evening,” he said. Khopde said the probability of violence or attack by Maoists remains high during such bandh called by them. “Apprehending trouble, a unit of special task force commandos of state police was sent to Gaya for extra vigilance soon after the four Maoist commanders were gunned down,” he said. The ADG said operations in Maoist-hit districts, especially those in south Bihar, were launched on Tuesday itself so that any attempt by the Reds to create trouble during the bandh could be averted. “The operations will continue for some time even after the bandh,” he said. “Forces have been mobilized as Wednesday midnight is crucial,” he said. Khopde said areas around railway stations and halts are under surveillance. “Intelligence inputs are being gathered for all locations and sources about any suspicious activity planned by the Maoists,” he said and added that security forces would also start distributing pamphlets in Maoist-affected areas from Thursday about policies and benefits offered by the government to the Reds on surrendering and joining the mainstream.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/first-day-of-maoist-bandh-passes-off-peacefully/articleshow/81675423.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The two-day campaign, scheduled on March 25 and 26, will see the party’s top brass and workers fanning through the state and handing over folders and other documents on the UP government’s achievements to people. A senior party leader said a door-to-door campaign in every booth is also being planned to maximise the reach. Sources said the party has also decided to distribute booklets detailing about the works done for each of the 403 assembly seats. The move is seen as the party’s attempt to consolidate its electoral ground in the run up to 2022 UP assembly elections. “The panchayat elections give us an opportunity to strengthen our position before the next state elections,” said UP BJP vice-president and in charge of panchayat elections, Vijay Bahadur Pathak. Party sources said the two-day campaign is timed amid speculation of notification on panchayat elections to be announced this month. “In a way the booth level programmes will be a pre-election campaign ahead of the three tier rural local bodies’ elections,” a senior UP BJP functionary told TOI. The development comes close on the heels of the party holding mass contact drives in 55,000 villages through its gram chaupal campaign which was organised from March 11-20. While the party has decided against fielding its functionaries in the gram sabha and block development council elections, it seeks to lend indirect support to the candidates who adhere to the saffron party ideology in the two rural local bodies. Importantly, the BJP state executive meet held last week, had mandated the party leadership to reach out to every section of society to consolidate its position. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and party general secretary (organisation), Sunil Bansal had subsequently asked the party MLAs and MPs to be part of a mass contact programme in the run up to panchayat elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-bjps-booth-level-drive-to-project-govts-achievements/articleshow/81677817.cms||Pankaj Shah

Even if the state government had allowed schools to conduct physical classes, many of them began a combination of online and offline classes. A few only allowed their senior students to attend offline classes and continued imparting online education to the pupils of the primary sections to ensure their safety. Don Bosco Academy vice-principal Eric de Rozario told this newspaper, “We have decided to conduct online classes for pupils up to Class VIII because the Covid situation has worsened. Only the students of classes IX to XII are attending physical classes.” He added, “The 2020-2021 academic session has ended and the new one will begin from the first week of April.” Asked about the arrangements for imparting virtual education, International School directress Farhat Hasan replied that the situation was different last year, but “we are fully prepared to switch to online classes this time”. “We have already asked the pupils of classes I and II to attend online classes because they are very small and need to take precautionary measures. For the other primary classes, we are imparting both virtual as well as offline education on alternate days,” Hasan added. Baldwin Academy, which is conducting its final year exams, will remain shut till the new session begins. Principal Rajiv Ranjan Sinha said, “If the state government take a decision on closure of schools, we are ready for online classes as everyone is comfortable attending them.” He, however, claimed that the only drawback of online classes was that a lot of students appeared to be less attentive as parents did not monitor their activities. Carmel High School principal Sr M Serena AC also pointed out that providing online education was no more a problem because “the students and the teachers are used to it”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/schools-ready-to-switch-to-online-classes-effortlessly/articleshow/81675624.cms||Faryal Rumi

Srinivasan, who has steered the company since 1980, catapulting it to the league of top five global manufacturers of two- and three-wheelers, will become its chairman emeritus. Speth, a German engineer, is credited with transforming JLR into a global marquee brand from a niche UK-centric manufacturer. Speth became JLR’s vice-chairman after he retired as its CEO last September. Both Speth and Srinivasan are board members of JLR’s parent Tata Sons. In a statement, the Chennai-based TVS Motor said that it has appointed Speth to its board of directors with a “clear eye on the future”. Speth, 65, with his deep insights on the automotive industry, will guide TVS to expand its international play, specifically in North America and Europe. Currently, a third of TVS’s total sales comes from the international market. Last April, TVS had acquired Norton motorcycles in the UK. Commenting on Speth, Srinivasan said, “His passion for technology, eye for products and commitment to building brands are truly remarkable.” Before joining JLR in 2010, Speth had stints with Linde, Premier Auto Group and BMW. He had presided over the longest profit streak in the history of JLR, which Tata had acquired from Ford. JLR is the biggest contributor to Tata Group’s $106-billion revenue. TVS Motor, the flagship of the $8.5-billion TVS Group, has also inducted Kuok Meng Xiong (MX), a prominent venture capitalist, into its board as an independent director. MX has led early investments in Grab, ByteDance, Airbnb & SpaceX, among other leading startups. Come January 2023, when Srinivasan becomes TVS Motor’s chairman emeritus, he will join a list of retired leaders who have been conferred with this honorary title.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ex-ceo-of-jlr-to-replace-tvs-chief-srinivasan-in-23/articleshow/81676725.cms||Reeba Zachariah

He also demanded action against officials involved in the "manhandling" of the MLAs, including women members. “My name is Tejashwi. CM Nitish & his puppet officers must know that no govt is permanent. MLAs were abused and beaten inside the assembly. They have set an unparliamentary trend. If CM does not apologise for the incident, we may boycott the assembly for the remaining tenure (sic),” read a tweet posted by Tejashwi on Wednesday. RJD, Congress and the Left parties also issued a joint statement on Wednesday dubbing the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021, as an unconstitutional bill that would transform the police into a militia. Interacting with the media outside the assembly, the younger Yadav scion said no one remains in power forever. The present CM will one day become an ex-CM, and the same police will thrash him using the same law after entering his house. Tejashwi and his elder brother Tej Pratap, along with other opposition leaders, posted a series of tweets attacking the Nitish government over Tuesday’s incident. Opposition MLAs also held a joint meeting on Wednesday and demanded stern action against officials involved in beating the legislators. “The entire opposition held a meeting and we all condemned the incident which occurred on Tuesday. We all have the footage of how some officials were kicking and hitting MLAs. Never in the history of the entire country has such an incident of officials beating MLAs inside the assembly has occurred. We will boycott the session till action is taken against such officials,” said Congress legislative party leader Ajit Sharma. Former CMs Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi also came down heavily on the government, especially CM Nitish, for Tuesday’s incident. However, former deputy CM and Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi criticised the opposition for creating confusion over the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021, and compared their protest with that of the farmer’s protest at the Delhi border. “The way a few so-called leaders tried to provoke the police on January 26 and compelled them to shoot by deviating from the decided route, in the same way, RJD intended to compel the police to call the marshals inside the House,” read a part of SuMo’s tweet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oppn-may-boycott-house-in-future/articleshow/81675523.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Rane is currently in his 11th term as MLA. Terming the octogenarian and five-time chief minister as a visionary leader and a gentleman politician, members of the House urged him to contest the upcoming 2022 assembly elections. Rane, however, clarified that he was yet to make a final decision on this. Requesting MLAs with folded hands not to waste the House’s precious time over congratulating him, Rane said, “I am happy for the love showered upon me. Whatever you seek to say about me, be it good or bad, you can say outside the House. In the House, you have already congratulated me and I thank you all. But time will not wait for us. The business of the House is very important and must be a priority.” Goa’s longest-serving MLA advised his counterparts to meet members of the general public and patiently hear their grievances. He told the legislators that even if they get small works done for the people, they would continue to get elected for the next 50-100 years. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat who moved the congratulatory motion, praised the veteran politician for his contribution to the overall development of the state. “His long career as MLA will always inspire upcoming leaders. He has performed his duty with dignity, decorum and discipline by respecting the values and principles of democracy,” Kamat said. Health minister Vishwajit Rane said that he had sought to hold a function to commemorate his father’s achievement. Recollecting an incident during Rane senior’s tenure as chief minister, Vishwajit said, “One day, I was giving instructions to a person while my father was behind me. He immediately summoned me and told me in front of over 100 people that Goa is a democracy and that only he could give instructions as CM and not me.” As the motion proceeded, members of the House said Rane was instrumental in acquiring land in the state to meet future developmental needs. They also praised him for resolving the contentious issues of language and statehood.

While the infected patients were treated at the outpatient department OPD level, the health department of Nashik Zilla Parishad has rushed a medical team to contain the spread of the vector-borne disease. District malaria officer Motilal Patil said the situation is under control and the medical teams are in the village to check if the residents have symptoms of Chikungunya. “The five patients had come to the primary health centre (PHC) in the village suffering from fever and joint pain. After their blood samples were sent for investigation, they were diagnosed with chikungunya three days ago. We immediately sent a medical team to the village to take stock of the situation,” he said. “Since it is summer, people generally keep the water stored, this leads to mosquitoes’ breeding. The gram panchayat has also been instructed to take measures to ensure there is no water logging in the open sewers,” he added.This is the first case of Chikungunya in the rural district this year. Asha workers and health workers routinely visit houses in their respective jurisdictions to check if there are cases of fever.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/outbreak-of-chikungunya-in-tribal-village-in-nashik/articleshow/81674669.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Of 70,280 samples tested, 431 returned a positive result, according to a health bulletin issued on Wednesday. The number of cases in the last 24 hours was also highest single-day figure this year. For the past few days, the government has been steadily increasing the RT-PCR tests as asymptomatic caseload has seen an upward spiral. The state has capacity to do one lakh tests daily, but till now, even when 3,000 cases were reported on an average, 50,000 tests were being done daily. In the last few days, the state has been conducting over 60,000 tests daily. The number of tests have increased as clusters (staff and students have contracted the infection) were reported at several educational institutes. The number of primary contacts tested was also high, 44% (30,923), while the secondary contacts tested stands at 8,433 (12%). The state has so far tested a cumulative 97,89,113 samples. The cumulative caseload of the state reached 3,04,298, while with two more deaths, the death toll went up to 1,676. However, the high number of tests and number of positives indicate low positivity rate, but there was a huge jump in the positivity rate in the last few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-tests-70k-for-1st-time-431-found-ve/articleshow/81677843.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||Demand for beds increasing in Mumbai, mostly in private hosps’||Mumbai: Task force member Dr Niteen Karnik, head of medicine at Sion Hospital, said Mumbai should, like Nagpur, opt for a “restricted lockdown’’ for two weeks. District administration in Beed was the latest to announce a 10-day restriction on business and services from Thursday onwards. Reflecting concern over growing numbers, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray told his cabinet on Wednesday about the need to boost vaccination and strictly enforce Covid-appropriate restrictions. "Maharashtra has been strictly following the guidelines issued by Centre and has been transparent about data. There are some states that have elections and some others who are hosting events with huge crowds there. How is that cases are not increasing in those states?" said Thackeray during the cabinet meeting. A presentation by the state health department for Wednesday’s cabinet meeting underlined the key issues: active cases have ballooned since February 11 in 35 districts, with Sindhudurg the only exception; doubling rate of cases has fallen to 63 days from 194 days on February 28; and recovery has slipped to 88.7% from 94% in the same period. Cases in Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai, Thane and Nashik contribute 61% of the state’s active cases. The Mumbai administrative block comprising Mumbai, Thane and nearby corporations, accounted for nearly a third (9,147) of Wednesday’s tally of 31,855. In Mumbai, the picture is getting bleaker as demand for hospital beds rises. Dr Prince Surana of Surana Hospital, Chembur, said enquiries have risen sharply. “We have 160 beds between two of our hospitals and they are full,’’ he said. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said as most patients these days are from “highrises’’, private health facilities are more sought after. “We have about 2,900 private sector beds and these will be shortly be upgraded to 5,000,’’ he said. Around 41% of the 13,083 beds in the public and private sector are still vacant in Mumbai, he added. “More tests will result in more positive cases,’’ he said. Dharavi, which has emerged as the barometer of Covid in Mumbai, reported 62 cases--the highest in the areas since May 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/demand-for-beds-increasing-in-mumbai-mostly-in-private-hosps/articleshow/81677223.cms||Malathy Iyer

At present, the city has 11,147 active cases. Given the government’s projection, the civic body has decided to increase the number of beds in Covid care centres (CCCs), dedicated Covid health centres (DCHCs) and dedicated Covid hospitals (DCH) from 3,500 to 4,500 over the next few days. Jadhav said they have also identified a private vacant building in the heart of the city where they are going to establish a 300-bed CCC, which will be operational within a week. With the help of the Jain Sanghatna, the civic body will have another 100-bed private hospital in the Panchavati area. The NMC will also be adding more beds in the Bytco hospital. Jadhav said seven hospitals have been permitted to start Covid treatment with a total capacity of 250 beds. According to Jadhav, the main cause for Covid’s spread is that a large number of people are still violating the health protocols — wearing masks and maintaining social distance. There was a spike in Covid cases in September 2020, when 867 cases were reported per day on average. But in October and November, 2020, the number had dropped. Even the first week of February recorded 99 daily cases on average. But during the past week, the city registered 1,200 cases per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/govt-20k-active-cases-in-nashik-city-by-april-4/articleshow/81674678.cms||Tushar Pawar

This is for the first time, the NMC has received good response for the interviews of MBBS physicians for its Covid hospitals — Bytco, Zakir Hussain and other Covid Care Centres. Last year, the NMC wanted 50 MBBS doctors, but had received only five applications. These five doctors were hired on temporary basis for a period of three months and later were given extension till January. After drop in number of new cases in the city, the NMC had released these doctors. However, now as the cases have started going up, the civic body has started recruiting various health staff, including doctors,lab technicians, nurses and ward boys. The NMC is facing shortage of health staff owing to which it had organized walk-in-interviews for over 200 various posts, including 25 MBBS doctors. “We have shortlisted eight MBBS doctors and appointment letters have been issued to them. This will help us for providing better treatment to Covid patients,” NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav said. As the number of new cases started going down in the first two months of 2021, the NMC released 526 temporary health employees after the end of their contract. But now as the trend has changed the civic body is trying its best to get the health staff back to work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-ropes-in-eight-mbbs-doctors-to-treat-patients/articleshow/81674690.cms||Tushar Pawar

In the letter to Shah, the chief minister asked for immediate action against the attackers. “It is reported that two postulants, who recently joined the Sacred Heart congregation in Delhi were travelling for the first time to their homes accompanied by two nuns, were harassed and intimidated by around 150 Bajrang Dal activists. You would agree with me that such incidents would tarnish the image of the nation and its ancient tradition of religious tolerance. Such incidents require utmost condemnation by the Union government,” the CM’s letter said. Vijayan also wanted the home minister to instruct authorities to initiate strict action against those who infringed upon the fundamental rights of the nuns. In his letter to the PM, Chennithala expressed pain, anguish and strong displeasure over the incident. “The nuns were attacked by wrongly accusing them of forceful conversion. Despite the nuns showing the details required, the police misbehaved with them. They were released after intervention from lawyers in Delhi,” Chennithala stated in his letter. He urged the PM to take measures to book the culprits at the earliest so that such incidents are not repeated. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-writes-to-shah-oppn-leader-urges-pm-for-action/articleshow/81676252.cms||---
---||Goa||In Covid aftermath, Rs 1700 crore to give booster dose to healthcare sector||PORVORIM: As expected, the government has raised the budget allotted for the health sector for 2021-22. The health ministry has been allotted Rs 1,719. 9 crore, a hike of 19.6% as compared to 2020-21. The funds will largely go towards completion of some of the projects that were put on the backburner owing to paucity of funds after the pandemic. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, while applauding doctors and other healthcare workers for fighting the pandemic, in his budget speech on Wednesday, said the new South Goa district hospital will be inaugurated by May 2021 and full-fledged cardiac facilities will be made available there. The government has missed several deadlines in the past. Its plan to commission the South Goa district hospital in May may fall apart if the surge in Covid cases witnessed now spills over the next two months. He also emphasised the government plan of having a medical college for South Goa as envisaged. The government has provided Rs 10 crore towards the completion of the Goa Dental College building. As for expansion of facilities at the Institute of Psychiatric and Human Behaviour (IPHB), Bambolim, Rs 53 crore has been set aside in addition to Rs 17.3 crore for setting up a daycare centre for patients suffering from mental illness. Other projects that will be completed are the cancer centre at Bambolim, another ambitious state government project that has been delayed. The construction of primary health centres at Cacora, Tuem, and Cansualim will be completed. Under the National Ayush Mission, an Ayush mental healthcare clinic will be built. Sawant also declared the government’s plan to start M Phil in clinical psychology from the next academic year. He said the existing mediclaim scheme will include cancer patients and they would get credit facilities. With a super-specialty block built at Bambolim set to be commissioned shortly, the government has also allotted Rs 3 crore for the organ transplant programme. Plus, health for all, a new initiative which has been proposed to be started from September has been announced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-covid-aftermath-rs-1-7k-cr-to-give-booster-dose-to-healthcare-sector/articleshow/81677842.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||HC notices to T & Andhra on MFI Act implementation||Hyderabad: The high court on Wednesday issued a notice to Telangana and Andhra Pradesh on implementation of the AP Microfinance Institutions (Regulation of Money Lending) Act, 2011. It also issued a notice to Telangana DGP asking him to file a counter on the issue. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy while adjourning the case to June 30 for further hearing made Telangana a party to the case after the Supreme Court, which set aside the 2013 order of the high court, sent the matter back to the Telangana high court to decide the legislative competency of the state in the matter. Speaking on behalf of some MFIs, senior counsel L Ravi Chander said: “Today, there is no central law on the issue and there is only AP law. The state of Telangana has adopted it.” Though AP was a party to the case, none appeared in the court on Wednesday. The bench issued a fresh notice to AP also. The Act was enacted by the combined state of Andhra Pradesh in 2011 to control micro-lending firms at the grassroots. With nearly 45 persons taking their own lives due to alleged coercive methods by the MFIs to recover loans and charge exorbitant interest rates, AP brought a special ordinance in 2010 to rein in the erring MFIs. The state legislature later enacted it as a special legislation in 2011. When several MFIs challenged the legislative competency of the state by arguing that the Centre was bringing out a comprehensive law on the subject, the AP high court stayed the law in February 2013 and asked all the parties to wait for the central bill introduced in Parliament to turn into an Act. “There is no point in delving into the aspect of legislative competence of a state when the Union government is coming out with a law on the subject,” the HC in its 2013 order reasoned. Meanwhile, the state challenged the decision of the high court in the Supreme Court. But, the Centre’s bill did not become an Act and the matter was later shelved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-notices-to-t-andhra-on-mfi-act-implementation/articleshow/81677840.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Pollution scan on commercial vehicles||KOLKATA: A large number of vehicles, mainly commercial ones, like mini buses, mini trucks and taxis, failed pollution tests carried out by the anti-pollution cell of Kolkata Police on Wednesday. App cabs fared better. The police have, however, not been able to identify whether the vehicles failed the tests due to poor maintenance or use of adulterated fuel. Given the high diesel and petrol prices, there is a suspicion that cartels may be siphoning off subsidised kerosene meant for below poverty line (BPL) consumers and operating irrigation pumps to mix it with diesel for a pocket-friendly alternative. An activist said buses and trucks were resorting to adulterated fuel that emit toxic fumes. “Whenever fuel prices rise, adulteration happens,” said activist Prabir Bose. On Wednesday, cops challaned vehicles that did not meet emission norms. In Kolkata, commercial vehicles are allowed to operate for 15 years but some continue thereafter. Cops want them phased out. The Centre recently announced a scrappage policy for both commercial and private vehicles. Large commercial vehicles, including goods carriers and buses, accounted for 74%-80% particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and PM 10 in Howrah and Kolkata, found a study conducted by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI). The West Bengal Pollution Control Board — prodded by National Green Tribunal — asked NEERI to conduct the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pollution-scan-on-city-commercial-vehicles/articleshow/81676260.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Business||Plan to raise PF contribution cap could benefit government staff||NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s amendment to her budget proposal on taxing interest income on provident fund contributions is expected to largely benefit babus, who park their surplus funds in the general provident fund. Instead of the Finance Bill proposal of taxing interest earned on employee contribution beyond Rs 2.5 lakh a year, Sitharaman doubled the limit in cases where there is no employer contribution. There are only a handful of private sector employees who stand to gain with almost the entire benefit going to government employees. Under GPF, the employee is the sole contributor with the government only paying interest. A lot of junior employees as well as top civil servants contribute significantly more than the statutory level and were upset by the government’s budget announcement. The amendment by the FM will certainly change their mood. “Contributions to PF are made through the employer, and hence for employees in the private sector, there would not be a situation where the employee contributes and there is ‘zero’ contribution from the employer. Hence the limit of Rs. 2.5 lakh per annum continues to be relevant to the private sector. However, for government employees, where the employees are eligible for pension, there would be no employer contributions made to the PF account. In these cases, the contributions would be made only by the employees, and it is this category of employees who would be benefited by the enhanced limit of Rs 5 lakh,” said Saraswathi Kasturirangan, partner at Deloitte India. For private sector employees, there are several issues that the income tax authorities need to clarify, starting with when the tax will be deducted to how it will be accounted for. Tax experts are worried since it took Sitharaman’s team almost a year after announcing a tax in case where the employer contributes over Rs 7.5 lakh annually in PF to notify the rules. Later, the Rajya Sabha approved the bill and the amendments by a voice vote. With this, the parliamentary approval for the 2021-22 budget is complete The FM’s reply was interrupted by TMC members over the issue of implementation of central government schemes in West Bengal. Earlier while replying to the debate, the finance minister pointed to low inflation, robust economic growth, record foreign investment and lower fiscal deficit as signs of the government’s deft handling of the economy. She attacked the Congress-led UPA government for leaving a “mess” and mismanaging the economy which the Modi administration had set right. “India was one of the fragile five economies when Arun Jaitley (Modi government’s first finance minister) inherited (in 2014). It became one of the fastest-growing economies. You created a crisis, Jaitleyji and Prime Minister Modi handled it,” she said. “The 2008 financial crisis was nothing in comparison to Corona crisis of last year.” The finance minister also said that there is no risk of a downgrade of the country’s sovereign rating due to a higher fiscal deficit in the current year which is due to the increasing spending to provide a boost to the economy. “India enjoys an investment-grade rating and we are not foreseeing any change or any chance of a downgrade due to us incurring higher deficits,” she said, adding the higher deficit was resulting from higher spending and increased borrowings,” said Sitharaman. “So globally that is the advice everybody is receiving and we are also following. So it shouldn't hurt our rating,” the FM said, adding that India was following the advice of economists and rating agencies who say that government spending is needed to put pandemic economies back on track.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/plan-to-raise-pf-contribution-cap-could-benefit-govt-staff/articleshow/81679228.cms||---

A decision in this regard has been taken following complaints by residents that private hospitals are denying beds for Covid-19 patients and some are overcharging.“I, along with civic officials, will be making surprise visits at private hospitals to ensure that patients are not inconvenienced,” said municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav on Wednesday.

We will keep a watch whether beds under this quota are allotted,” he said. “We have already reactivated the auditors at 76 private covid hospitals to keep an eye on allocation of beds for the Covid patients,” added Sonkamble.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/audit-teams-reactivated-amid-plaints-of-hosps-denying-beds/articleshow/81674705.cms||Tushar Pawar

Talking to reporters at his residence on Wednesday, Rai claimed having a spotless public life of 30 years in which he won five assembly elections and contested twice against PM Narendra Modi. “Except some political cases, not a single criminal case has been lodged against me. From 2014, I have been exposing lapses in ongoing development works in PM’s constituency, which is healthy practice in a democratic setup,” said Rai. The state government is indulging in vendetta politics and is targeting me despite knowing that I am a complainant and a prime witness against jailed mafia don Mukhtar Ansari in the murder case of my brother Awadhesh Rai, he said. “The government withdrew my security cover and cancelled arms licences. When I tried to draw attention of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, one armed constable was provided to me in February for being a former MLA, but he was also withdrawn on March 21,” said Rai. If the government is really keen on ensuring punishment for Mukhtar, why it is put my life at stake despite knowing that my evidence will ensure capital punishment for him, he asked. Rai had opened front against the state government on January 7 by claiming threat to his life from Mukhtar and refusal of state government to provide proper security cover to him despite being a prime witness against the jailed don. He had also targeted BJP MLA and Krishnanand Rai’s widow Alka Rai for writing letters to Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and accusing Congress government in Punjab of shielding Mukhtar after Ropar jail authorities refused to hand him over to UP Police for producing him in court for hearing in cases pending against him. Rai’s brother had been shot dead outside his residence in 1991. Rai is complainant and prime witness against Mukhtar and other accused, though he enjoyed support of Mukhtar’s Qaumi Ekta Dal in 2014 parliamentary election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cong-leader-ajay-rai-accusesstate-govt-of-vendetta-politics/articleshow/81675743.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Compassionate jobs not a right of all married daughters: Telangana HC||HYDERABAD: In a significant observation, the Telangana high court on Wednesday said married daughters may need not be given jobs on compassionate grounds if they were no longer dependent on their parents. “It is alright to declare married women as eligible to gain employment on compassionate grounds upon the death of a serving parent, but it is also important to see whether such women were really in need of it,” said Chief Justice Hima Kohli, who along with Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, heard a plea from a woman, who wanted her mother's job on compassionate grounds The petition was filed by Bandari Divya, daughter of an employee of Ranga Reddy district court, who challenged the decision of the district judge for rejecting her application for employment. Her mother Bandari Swaroopa was employed with Ranga Reddy district court as a process server. In fact, she got this job on compassionate grounds upon the death of her husband seven years ago. After she died in April 2020, her daughter Divya sought the job on compassionate grounds. The high court standing counsel Nalin Kumar argued that Divya got married nine years ago and was leading an independent life elsewhere. “She is not dependent on her mother's earnings,” he said, while Divya’s counsel argued that Swaroopa had two daughters and since married daughters are also eligible to seek employment, they are eligible for the post. Divya’s sister gave a no-objection letter saying that the job can be given to her sister. The bench said the rejection letter given by the district judge was not properly worded. “It says that it is unconstitutional to exclude a married woman, but in the end, it rejects the application of a married daughter. The rejection letter carried no reasons for the rejection,” Justice Kohli said while setting aside the DJ's letter. The bench directed the district judge of Ranga Reddy to now pass an order assigning reasons for the decision within four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-compassionate-jobs-not-a-right-of-all-married-daughters/articleshow/81677889.cms||---

The event was organised in Jayapur, the first adopted village of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on the occasion. Under this programme, Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL), an entirely owned subsidiary of Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), will distribute high quality LED bulbs at an affordable price of Rs 10 per bulb in rural areas of Varanasi. Under phase 1 of the Gram Ujala programme, 1.5 crore LED bulbs will be distributed which will have a significant impact on India’s climate change action energy savings of 2025 million kWh/year and CO2 reductions of 1.65 million T CO2/year. This will lead to a better standard of life, financial savings, more economic activity and better safety for rural citizens. Singh congratulated CESL for its new initiative under which it will provide affordable and high-quality LED bulbs to the rural population. He also appreciated the Uttar Pradesh government for electrification of every village in the state in nearly four years after signing the ambitious ‘Power for All’ agreement with the Centre. The minister said that India is leading in energy transition as well as energy efficiency. “This scheme is designed specifically for rural homes keeping affordability in mind. It will also result in energy savings as a 12-watt LED bulb gives equivalent light as does a 100-watt incandescent bulb. He further lauded EESL’s efforts in implementing Ujala scheme under which 36 crore LED bulbs have been distributed and 1.15 crore street lights have been replaced with LED lights across the country. This has resulted in energy savings of thousands of megawatts in the country. Singh said that the scheme has crossed 6,150 distribution mark in Arrah, Bihar within two days of launch. Under the programme, 7-watt and 12-watt LED bulbs with 3 years warranty will be given to rural consumers against submission of working incandescent bulbs. The Gram Ujala programme will be implemented only in villages of the five districts where consumers can exchange a maximum of 5 LED bulbs. These rural households will also have meters installed in their houses to monitor number of hours of usage. Carbon credits will be prepared under the Shine Program of Activities with an option for verifying under the Voluntary Carbon Standard, depending on the needs of buyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/affordable-led-bulbs-to-be-distributed-in-all-rural-households-of-kashi/articleshow/81677019.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Varanasi||IIT-BHU scientists use teak, neem ash to extract toxins from water||Varanasi: The scientists of IIT-BHU claimed to have succeeded in the research of extracting many toxic substances from water by using ash made from teak and neem wood. This method is not only eco-friendly, but also inexpensive and can also be adopted to purify Ganga water besides reducing the cost of ROs while retaining the available minerals in the water. Dr Vishal Mishra, an assistant professor of biochemical engineering, and his team have prepared two different types of adsorbent from the ashes of teak wood sawdust and neem stalk, thereby separating the harmful metals, ions from the water that can be made potable. He said that in recent years, adsorption has been considered inexpensive and more effective than other chemical techniques. It costs less and is considered very effective in the prevention of water borne diseases. He said that the wood powder of teak (scientific name: Tectona grandis) is mixed with sodium thiosulfate and heated in an atmosphere of nitrogen to make activated charcoal (coal). Also, adsorbent is also made from neem (scientific name: Azadirachta Indica) stalk ash (neem twig ash). On one hand, the teak can extract harmful gases, ions, sulfur, selenium in water from coal made of wood, and on the other hand the study of neem ash is intended for the treatment of polluted water containing copper, nickel and zinc. He pointed out that many researchers in the world have already investigated available porous (perforated / extremely small holes) charcoal as an active agent, but their method of chemical synthesis involves several drawbacks. Porous charcoal made from sawdust wood powder is harmless and eco-friendly. Sodium thiosulfate is not a toxic reagent (a chemical substance helps in the discovery of other substances). Sodium thiosulfate has many medicinal applications. On the other hand, neem seeds, bark and leaves have been used as an adsorbent by various researchers but neem stalk ashes have not been used for purity of water. He said that the nickel present in water is responsible for asthma, neuro disorder, nosia, kidney and lung cancer. Zinc causes fatigue, lethargy, dizziness and excessive thirst, and the excess copper in the water is genotoxic, which can cause changes in DNA and also damage the liver and kidneys. According to him, this method can also be adopted to purify Ganga water. The Ganga is rich in nickel, zinc and copper. Packed Bed Column (PBC) method in Ganga is made clean with the help of ETP (Efficient Treatment Plant). In these ETPs, initiatives can be taken to clean Ganga water very cheaply using coal made from teak wood and ash made from Neem stalks. He said that it may also reduce the cost of RO being sold in the market. Currently RO systems are installed in almost every household. Coal made from teak wood sawdust can be used to purify water in place of the activated charcoal in the RO system. This will also reduce the total cost of RO and the available minerals in the water will be safe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/iit-bhu-scientists-use-teak-neem-ash-to-extract-toxins-from-water/articleshow/81694729.cms||Binay Singh

India looked hopelessly out of place in the opening half as Oman called the shots and took the lead through an own goal from Chinglensana Singh in the 42nd minute. In the next 45 minutes, though, as coach Stimac rang the changes, they were a much-improved side and equalised through Manvir Singh in the 55th minute Manvir has been on song in the Indian Super League (ISL) this season. The ATK Mohun Bagan striker, often playing out of position, scored six goals and was leading the charge in the absence of Sunil Chhetri. While all six goals in ISL this season have come from Manvir’s boots, the ATK Mohun Bagan striker scored with a header for the first time since leaving FC Goa. It was well timed. Ashutosh Mehta, among the six debutants at the start, was the one who started it all with an excellent press to win the ball. He passed it to Bipin Singh and the Mumbai City winger picked out Manvir inside the box with an excellent delivery. The goal provided some comfort to India who were poor in the first half. Oman were the superior side, far more than the 23 spots that separate them and India. At the start, they came hunting for the opening goal and it was a surprise that they had to wait for 42 minutes. After all, Oman had several shots on goal. And they even missed a penalty, poorly taken by Abdulaziz Al Maqbali, who had won it himself after being brought down by Rowllin Borges inside the danger zone. In-form Amrinder Singh, given the nod ahead of Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, didn’t have to do much to save the attempt in the 26th minute. Amrinder, though, was found wanting as India conceded the first goal just before the change of ends. Zahir Al Aghbari followed a through ball inside the box and squared it in the middle where the goalkeeper failed to collect cleanly and the ball hit Chinglensana before entering the nets. The goal should have deflated India and handed Oman the advantage. In the second half, the opposite happened. As Lalengmawia (Apuia), Raynier Fernandes and Mohammed Yasir took the field, India found balance and control. They were better with their passing and suddenly Oman found themselves with work to do. During this period of ascendancy, India equalised with their first attempt on goal. This was India’s third draw against Oman in 12 matches. Having lost nine, including both in the Fifa World Cup 2022 qualifiers, and given the start they had, Stimac will take this friendly result. “The game was very fast,” said debutant Suresh Singh. “The coach told us do not even sleep for a second on the field, watch your man, always remain focused. We did what the coach told us. The feeling was much better in the second half.” Apuia was among the first change for India in the second half and the NorthEast United FC midfielder gave a wonderful account of himself. “It was quite difficult. The intensity was very high and the opponents were strong. This was more difficult than I expected. Great experience,” said Apuia. India play United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the second international friendly on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/india-rally-to-hold-superior-oman/articleshow/81695021.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Annual examinations scheduled on March 25 and 26 for these classes, will now be scrapped. The decision comes two days after the government cited Holi vacation to suspend classes in government and private schools from March 23 to March 31 for students of class 1-8. Director general, school education, Vijay Kiran Anand, late Tuesday issued a notice to basic education officers of all districts, stating students of class 1-8 will be promoted and the new academic session will begin from April 1. An assessment/evaluation of students based on their performance in the previous class will be done in last week of April. Instructions for assessment will be issued separately, he said. Anand, however, had earlier specified that no student would be denied promotion to the next class in keeping with Right to Education Act, while issuing orders for holding annual examinations. “By conducting an evaluation test, the department wants to justify funds allocated for examinations. If no child would be made to repeat a class, what’s the purpose of assessment,” asked a government school teacher. Around Rs 6 crore was earmarked for conducting examinations in government schools. Class 9-11 students of schools recognised by UP Secondary Education Board will be promoted only after they pass the annual exam. “We won’t automatically promote students of higher classes. We suspended offline teaching in all schools till March 31. Courses are complete in most schools, but others can still hold online classes,” said deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/direct-promotion-for-1-6cr-up-school-kids/articleshow/81677888.cms||Isha Jain

While hearing this petition, the court had March 1 directed the people to observe hundred per cent masking. Besides, the court had also directed the police to see that one and all wear masks. In these directives, the court had made it clear that non-wearing of masks should entail penalties as have been enumerated in the Pandemic Act and other relevant laws. Besides, crowding should be stopped with immediate effect. The control of number of guests in marriages and other social functions, etc., should be observed and any violation should be strictly punished, the court had added. In addition to the above, the court had directed that the schools and colleges where small children go should not be asked to start physical classes. If, however, for any reason schools are physically functioning then all guidelines issued by the state government should be followed in letter and spirit. Institutions where students above the 10th class have to compulsorily attend classes, it should be seen that they observe social distancing and that they also wear masks, the court added. “Eateries should see that no food is served in the open, that is to say, people should take covered food in packets and should eat them at their home. Within the restaurants, tables should be laid in such a manner that social distancing is properly observed,” the court had directed. During the course of hearing, the police department informed that so far as masking is concerned, in between March 1, 2021 and March 21, 2021, it had challaned only 1,192 persons for not wearing masks in the city of Prayagraj. Chandan Sharma, advocate commissioner, also informed that almost nobody is wearing a mask. Taking a serious note of these submissions, the division bench comprising Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar observed, “This small number of penalisation shows that the police has also become complacent.” So far as observance of the Covid guidelines in the High Court is concerned, the court directed the counsel appearing for the High Court to inform as to how guidelines would be followed. The court has fixed March 26 for the next hearing of this PIL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-to-govt-why-covid-normsare-not-being-followed-in-state/articleshow/81675722.cms||---

A division bench comprising Justice A Muhamed Mustaque and Justice CS Dias issued the directive after considering a total of 30 cases filed by litigants before family courts seeking speedy justice. While issuing guidelines that would result in a uniform procedure for disposal of cases before family courts, the high court said it apprehends that the backlog is leading to a collapse of justice delivery system. Cases that are five years and older, are pending before family courts, the court pointed out. Family courts should designate the most competent ministerial officer as chief ministerial officer (CMO) for case flow management, the high court directed. It is the CMO who should fix dates for appearance of respondents, for counselling between the parties, for mediation, and for court hearing, the guidelines said. Stating that judicial time is wasted for roll calls, the high court directed presiding officers of family courts to bestow their attention only on matters where the courts have to pass judicial orders. Only execution proceedings, interlocutory applications requiring urgent orders, cases listed for trial and hearing, and day-to-day trial should be listed before the family courts, the high court said. Also, a special list of cases ripe for trial should be maintained by family courts and the CMO should fix the date for trial with the approval of the judge, the guidelines said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/focus-just-on-trials-hc-tells-judges/articleshow/81676286.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: CM Takes Poll Position With Swayampurna Budget||PORVORIM: From farmers to school children and mining-dependents to taxi operators, chief minister Pramod Sawant had something for everyone on Wednesday as he presented the budget for 2021-22. Sawant, who presented the BJP-led government’s final budget for the current assembly term, loosened the strings of an empty purse as he set about wooing voters for the upcoming 2022 assembly elections. Sawant’s Rs 25,058.65 crore budget is ambitious, but what it lacked was a clear roadmap for implementation. Of this, Sawant has kept aside just Rs 6,914 crore for capital works, with the remaining funds being kept aside for revenue expenses such as salaries, debt repayment and maintenance. The chief minister offered massive budgetary allocations for infrastructure development, tourism, power, health, education and tribal welfare. However, Sawant, who also holds the finance portfolio, could not give a clear picture of where the state would find the money to fund the projects. Among the major announcements made by Sawant in his budget speech are strengthening of tertiary care cancer facilities (for which Rs 150 crore has been allocated), increase in the income limit to Rs 5 lakh for eligibility under the Mediclaim scheme, setting up of a MLA-local area development fund (for which Rs 100 crore has been earmarked) and completion of water treatment plants across the state, amounting to Rs 1,960 crore. “I have scope till December to complete all the works of this budget,” Sawant said. “Our direct collections are Rs 14,787 crore. Definitely, it is our aim to implement this budget before the code comes into force,” he said in his two-hour speech. He also announced that the state expects to earn Rs 550 crore from the resumption of mining once the corporation is formed. Sawant also kept aside Rs 380 crore for sewerage schemes and proposed to formulate a house sewer connection scheme for households to avail sewer connection at a reduced cost. The chief minister admitted that the Covid-19 pandemic had affected the state’s finances, but still projected the state’s economy to grow at 9.72%. Though Sawant estimated revenue receipts to increase at 16.39% in the coming financial year, which he attributed to greater central assistance, finance department officials pointed out that the state continues to face a tax revenue deficit. In line with his endeavour to endear himself to voters, Sawant chose to keep taxes on liquor unchanged. Sawant’s budget projects a notional surplus of a mere Rs 58 crore, but finance secretary Puneet Kumar Goel admitted that for the current financial year, the state faces a deficit of Rs 133 crore. The chief minister generously laced his speech with the word Swayampurna, as he spoke about the need to make Goa self-reliant. However, as the opposition and financial experts pointed out, freebies such as free digital taxi meters and regularisation of illegal homes do little to encourage self-reliance. Sawant, who began his speech by recollecting Goa’s freedom struggle, said that his government proposes to construct a memorial for freedom fighters at Patradevi. A six-lane bridge including approaches at Rawanfond, Margao, a warehouse for storage of EVM & VVPAT machines, a bus stand at Mapusa, and a four-lane bridge at Hodar in Curchorem have been planned, along with upgradation of infrastructure of the primary health centre, Sanguem. For all this, Sawant has provided a capital outlay of Rs 450 crore for the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-takes-poll-position-with-swayampurna-budget/articleshow/81677882.cms||---

The arrested persons were identified as Anju and Sreeju. They were arrested for the murder of Arun, 36, a resident of Anadu. Arun and Anju were live-in partners and had been living separately for the past six months. Sreeju and Anju were reportedly in a relationship, which Arun had allegedly resented. Arun was employed as a temporary AC technician in a government guest house in the city. According to police, Arun went to Anju’s house on Tuesday night where he confronted Sreeju. An altercation and physical tussle ensued. Sreeju attacked Arun with a knife. During the tussle, Anju and Sreeju also sustained minor wounds. Later, Sreeju stabbed Arun below the left chest. Arun ran out of house screaming for help and he collapsed in the front yard. Sreeju fled the scene. The neighbours took Arun to Nedumangad hospital where the doctor referred him to Medical College Hospital. He was declared dead at the MCH. The police then took Anju into custody and also tracked down Sreeju from Anadu. Arun and Anju have a 9-year-old daughter who was also in the house when the incident happened. Sreeju was employed as the driver of a tipper truck. The police have charged Anju and Sreeju with sections related to house trespass, murder and act done by persons with a common intention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/two-arrested-for-murder/articleshow/81676291.cms||---

---||Goa||National Games projects to be ready soon, Rs 150 crore for organisation: Chief minister Pramod Sawant||PORVORIM: Chief minister Pramod Sawant has assured the National Games organising committee that there would be no shortage of funds for the conduct of the much-delayed event, as and when it happens. The 36th edition of National Games in Goa has been delayed since 2016 with no word yet on when the Games can take place. While initially the Games were delayed because the infrastructure was not ready, the coronavirus pandemic has made it worse. Sawant, though, has set aside Rs 150 crore for the “successful conduct of the National Games” and assured to complete the infrastructural work at the earliest. The organising committee has drawn up a budget of Rs 202 crore for the organisation of the Games and remain hopeful that the shortfall would be covered at a later stage. The organisational costs include accommodation, ceremonies, marketing, technology support, venue operations, transport, administration and volunteer management. “Out of the eleven sports complexes/stadiums constructed for the purpose of National Games, five complexes at Navelim, Fatorda, Sawalwadda, Campal and Ponda have already been completed and the remaining six would be completed soon,” the chief minister said in his budget speech on Wednesday. According to sources at the Sports Authority of Goa (SAG), work at several other places is expected to be completed in the next two or three months. “The swimming pool at Campal was scheduled to be inaugurated by March 31, but the contractor delayed. Work will now be completed in the next 15 days,” said one official. Other projects that are still waiting to see the light of day are changing rooms for the hockey stadium at the Peddem sports complex in Mapusa, upgradation of squash court at Chicalim sports complex and development of lawn tennis courts at Fatorda. The chief minister has also proposed to formulate a policy to monetise sports facilities on PPP model at no cost basis. The state government has constructed several sports facilities across the state, first for the Lusofonia Games 2014 and later the National Games. Most of the infrastructure is out of bounds for regular training with the Sport Authority of Goa (SAG) incurring heavy expenditure on maintenance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/national-games-projects-to-be-ready-soon-rs-150cr-for-organisation-sawant/articleshow/81677877.cms||---

It is the third time customs has issued a summons to Vinodini and in the third notice, which was delivered to her in person, she was asked to be present at the Kochi office on March 30. Customs had earlier served two notices to Vinodini, asking her to appear in its Kochi office. She did not respond to the first notice and in reply to the second one, which asked her to be present at the Kochi office on Tuesday at 10am, she sought more time. “If she doesn’t respond to the third notice and fails to appear for questioning, a warrant will be issued against her,” said customs sources. The customs decided to question Vinodini after the agency traced the IMEI number of one of the six iPhones, given by Unitac MD Santhosh Eappen to gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh, to a SIM card reportedly registered in Vinodini’s name. The SIM card was found to have been used in the phone for a particular period of time and Vinodini was summoned to get clarity on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/customs-issues-third-notice-to-vinodini-balakrishnan/articleshow/81676295.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Burqa ‘inhumane’ for Muslim women, should be banned like triple talaq: Min||Varanasi: After urging Ballia district magistrate to take action for not allowing ‘azaan’ on loudspeakers from during the hours prescribed by courts, lowering volume of loudspeakers and removal of excess loudspeakers from a local mosque, UP minister of state for parliamentary affairs and rural development Anand Swaroop Shukla termed ‘Burqa’ as an evil and inhumane practice. Shukla released videos on the issues over the last 24 hours and they soon went viral on social media. In one video released on Tuesday, he demanded action on ‘azaan’ via loudspeakers and said the orders of Supreme Court and High Court on use of loudspeakers should be ensured. In another video, he said, “Burqa is inhumane practice imposed on Muslim women. Many countries have banned it. Like we have abolished triple talaq, burqa should also be banned in the country.” Earlier, Shukla had written a letter to the DM on Tuesday seeking action against ‘azaan’ through loudspeakers. He alleged that the high volume of loudspeakers of Madina mosque at Kajipur in Kotwali area of his assembly constituency Ballia causes disturbance to three nearby educational institutions but also affects him when he does yoga, meditation, worship or official work at his home. “The high volume ‘azaan’ of five times and messages for donation for mosque construction continue the whole day. The noise pollution is leaving an adverse impact on the health of children, ailing and elderly people besides disturbing students studying for their exams,” Shukla said. Referring to judgments of the Supreme Court and Allahabad High Court on noise pollution, he asked DM Ballia to reduce the numbers of loudspeakers and lowering of their volume. When reporters asked DM Ballia Aditi Singh about action on the minister’s letter, she said, “All complaints received are properly investigated and action is taken accordingly.” Shukla released one more video saying, “Those who used to threaten that country’s roads will turn red with blood if Article 370 is removed from Jammu and Kashmir, triple talaq is abolished and Citizenship Amendment Act is enacted, have already seen all this happening. They should keep it in mind that the SC and HC have banned the use of loudspeaker between 10pm and 6am and also prescribed volume limits for the remaining hours.” After his remarks drew reaction, Shukla on Thursday said women should have the freedom to wear clothes of their choice. Last week, Allahabad University vice-chancellor Prof Sangita Srivastava had complained to DM Prayagraj against the high volume ‘azaan’ on loudspeakers from a mosque near her residence. The number of loudspeakers were reduced from four to two and their volume was also turned down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/burqa-inhumane-for-muslim-women-should-be-banned-like-triple-talaq-min/articleshow/81694743.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Goa||Uproar over double-tracking, House adjourned for 15 minutes||PANAJI: Chaos ensued on the first day of the budget session of the Goa assembly over the South Western Railway (SWR) double-tracking project. The House was adjourned for 15 minutes when opposition members ran to the well demanding a discussion on the issue for half an hour. The ruckus started during “Question Hour” over a question tabled by BJP’s Cortalim legislator Alina Saldanha who demanded an explanation from revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate. Saldanha said majority of land acquired for the doubling project proposed from Collem to Vasco was private and asked if a detailed study showing the proximity of the second track from people’s houses was carried out. She also sought information if a study was carried out to compute the impact of raising the level of the land proposed along certain stretches of the second track. Earlier, the revenue minister had told the House that notices were issued and hearings conducted for land acquired and a total of land acquired from private parties for the project was 8%. An MLA from the ruling party tried to disturb Saldanha when she was raising the issue which largely concerns her constituency. She had to admonish him since the speaker did not intervene. The Question Hour ended before Monserrate could reply to other questions raised by Saldanha. While speaker Rajesh Patnekar declared the end of the Question Hour, Saldanha said since it was an important question, it needed to be answered and the speaker should extend the hour, as was done in a few cases in the past. The speaker, however, said it was never done. This is when opposition members stood in support of her and said the issue raised by the Cortalim MLA deserves a reply. They demanded a discussion on the issue for half an hour. Congress legislator Aleixio Reginaldo Lourenco rushed to the well of the House followed by Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai and what ensued were noisy scenes compelling the speaker to adjourn proceedings for a brief period. But Patnekar declined saying Saldanha could place a written request if she wants it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/uproar-over-double-tracking-house-adjourned-for-15-mins/articleshow/81677946.cms||---
---||Goa||To placate cabbies, Rs 32 crore set aside for free digital meters||PORVORIM: The installation of digital fare meters may finally see light of day after missing countless deadlines. The transport sector will see the development of a scheme to encourage installation of digital meters in commercial vehicles, for which a provision of Rs 32 crore has been made. A one-time free-installation of digital fare meters has been proposed at this year’s budget by the state government. TOI had reported on March 24 that a decision with regard to the implementation of digital meters will soon be taken. Transport minister Mauvin Godinho, while speaking at the flag-off of 30 electric buses on Tuesday, had said that there are backhand services that are in the process of getting completed to monitor and track the vehicles. This is being handled by the National Informatics Centre (NIC). Presenting the budget at the legislative assembly, chief minister Pramod Sawant also proposed to establish three vehicle testing centres in the state. Schemes on which bus operators are dependent are also being revived this year. The existing fuel subsidy scheme has provided financial assistance to 508 private state carriage owners as of December, last year. A provision of Rs 18 crore has been made for this scheme, this year. The bus replacement scheme to weed out older and highly polluting vehicles from the road has received Rs 9 crore this year. In addition to this, the accidental death insurance scheme has received Rs 1.5 crore this year. Sawant also proposed to formulate the Kadamba Saathi scheme wherein the Kadamba Transport Corporation (KTC) can hire private carriage service to provide transport facilities on certain routes at subsidised rates. For the implementation of this scheme, an amount of Rs 10 crore have been earmarked for this year. Under ease of doing business, facilities have been expanded by adding more payment services this year like payment of road tax and passenger tax (for new registration and other state vehicles), bulk payment of passenger taxes, facilitation-cum-inspection fee payment by dealers, counter signature fees, payment and cess fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-placate-cabbies-rs-32cr-set-aside-for-free-digital-meters/articleshow/81677893.cms||---

---||Goa||Reeling under pandemic, tourism sector gets balm||PORVORIM: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday declared initiatives for the tourism sector, which has been one of the biggest casualties of the Covid-19 pandemic. A tourism trade support scheme for registered hotels in the category of B, C and D, and for travel and tour operators were announced. Potential beneficiaries will be provided with an interest subvention on working capital loans up to Rs 25 lakh. Sawant announced a budget allocation of Rs 5 crore for this initiative. The scheme will benefit more than 2,000 hotels/accommodations and over 1,000 tour and travel operators, he said. To reduce the burden of charter operators towards parking and landing fees at Dabolim international airport, the chief minister declared a provision of Rs 5 crore. Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) had been requesting the government to reduce parking and landing fees even before the pandemic. TTAG president Nilesh Shah said it is a good initiative, and that the scheme would be beneficial. “We had sought relief in the form of waivers, which has not been granted. The government has offered relief in other forms. It is good, but there could have been more,” Shah said. Atish Fernandes, director of First Class Holidays, said that making a provision to cut expenses of charter flights towards parking and landing fees will directly benefit the charter market. The support scheme, he said, will be an academic exercise until the eligibility criteria for cash flow is not clear. Another significant proposition announced was to develop villages by promoting homestays, backwater tourism and experiential tours under “Atmanirbhar Bharat, Swayampurna Goa.” “Model villages would be developed on unique themes such as tribal, agro, crafts, heritage, and other such concepts, which would allow tourists to visit offbeat locations instead of concentrating only on the coastal belt,” Sawant said, while announcing a budget provision of Rs 5 crore for the same. Fernandes said without a sustainable plan, these initiatives will do more harm than good. The chief minister further announced Rs 1 crore to set up the Goa Tourism Board. To increase the base of tourist guides, a “tourist facilitator programme” free of cost to Goan youth, was announced. He also announced plans to develop an advanced curriculum to offer training in soft skills, etiquettes, and one foreign language. To make beaches safe and clean, a provision of Rs. 48.6 crore were declared and Rs 75 crore for Goa Tourism Development Corporation for infrastructure projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/reeling-under-pandemic-tourism-sector-gets-balm/articleshow/81677921.cms||---

The fisheries sector has already been promised an investment of Rs400 crore by Union minister Giriraj Singh. The central government has approved the state’s proposals for this sector amounting tp Rs 44.66 crore, Sawant said. To provide a boost to estuarine and brackish water fishing as well as diversification from captive fishing to inland fishing, Rs 3.63 crore have been allocated. Similarly, a provision of Rs 14 crore has been made this year for subsidising VAT and fuel to the fishermen across the state. In addition, special drives are being undertaken to cover fishermen under the Kisan credit cards and so far 235 fishermen have already been issued cards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gaushalas-get-rs-10cr-shelter-in-budget/articleshow/81677938.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Collectors told to deploy special teams to weed out bogus voters||Thiruvananthapuram: The election commission has decided to come up with strict measures to avoid repetition of the same names in the voters’ list and thereby avoid bogus votes. In the wake of complaints from the opposition about the duplicate and multiple entries of the same names in the voters’ list, chief electoral officer Teeka Ram Meena instructed all the district collectors to take strict measures. In the examination by the district collectors, it was found that several names were repeated in the list, with the same photos and with minor changes in address and other details. Under normal circumstances, the duplicate entries are removed using ERONET de-duplication software. But in the case of states where elections have been announced, the direction from the election commission was to dispose of the applications received for adding the names to the voters’ list. All the district collectors have been asked to constitute special teams under the electoral registration officers and remove the duplicate names by March 25. Those names, which are either confirmed or are suspected duplications are to be verified using the “logical error” facility of the software and have to be sent to the respective local booths for physical verification. This has to be conducted along with the distribution of the voters’ slip. In this way, the list of duplicate names, after being verified by the booth-level officers has to be handed over to the returning officers before March 30. The voters in this list are to be specially noted and should be allowed to leave the polling booths only after the indelible ink is dried after application. If an anomaly is observed in a booth and that booth is not shortlisted for webcasting, such booths also will have to be covered under webcasting. The commission also said that even if the polling agent does not object, it is the duty of the polling officers to identify and flag impersonation. The commission warned that if any such fraud is found, action will be taken against concerned polling officials. The chief electoral officer asked all the district electoral officers and the returning officers to bear all these things in mind and supervise accordingly. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala had flagged more than three lakh duplicate voters in as many as 135 constituencies in the state and had approached the election commission for appropriate and immediate action in the matter. Meanwhile, BJP state president and candidate in Manjeswaram constituency K Surendran asked why the opposition leader did not flag the duplicate votes in Manjeswaram. He said there are more than 2,000 duplicate votes, and that he has approached the commission on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/collectors-told-to-deploy-special-teams-to-weed-out-bogus-voters/articleshow/81677233.cms||---
---||Goa||To woo dependants, govt to form mining corp||PORVORIM: In a pre-poll outreach to over 2 lakh voters in the state’s mining belt, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday announced the setting up of a Goa Mining Corporation to restart the industry through auctioning of leases. “The government will sign an MoU with the Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd (MECL)... and that will help the state government start the process for e-auction,” Sawant said, adding that in the current assembly session itself, a new bill would be introduced to form the corporation. Mining in Goa came to a halt three years ago. While it’s currently unknown if the industry would restart this financial year, Sawant has set a target to mop up Rs 550 crore from the industry. But he was evasive when asked if the industry would start post-monsoon, saying, “The government is 100% committed to restarting mining in the state, and that’s the reason we will form the corporation”. Of the state's 40 constituencies, ten have substantial areas dependent on mining, four in South Goa (Sanvordem, Curchorem, Sanguem, Quepem) and six in North Goa (Poriem, Valpoi, Bicholim, Sakhali, Mayem, Tivim). Eight of these are represented by BJP MLAs. Meanwhile, reacting to the state government’s decision, the Goa Mineral Ore Exporters’ Association (GMOEA) told TOI that resumption of mining operations in the state has always been the objective of the association and its members. “Resumption of mining has to be done as per prevailing laws and Acts, as well as in accordance with the matter before the court,” said president Ambar Timblo. The Goa mining people’s front (GMPF), a body of mining-dependent people, welcomed the decision with caution. “Declaring the intentions of a mining corporation without the road map to restore or protect employment has no meaning for mining-dependent people,” said its president Puti Gaonkar. “The road map of employment for workers at mines, trucks and barges needs to be spelled out along with the declaration of the intention to form the corporation.” “Government must immediately induct persons who have lost their jobs and are suffering for many years,” Gaonkar said. “It has no meaning if jobs are not restored immediately, and will remain a farce to the ears of the Goan people.” A political observer said that the decision of the state government would definitely bring some hope to mining-dependent persons, but the question was whether Sawant would be able to restart mining before the code of conduct comes into force before the next assembly election, in 2022. Mining in Goa has been dormant since February 2018, when the Supreme Court quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases and stopped mining activities from March that year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-woo-dependants-govt-to-form-mining-corp/articleshow/81677922.cms||---

Dr Niteen Karnik, a member of the task force and head of medicine at Sion Hospital, said more curbs have become essential to break the chain of transmission. “Like Nagpur that put a strict but restricted lockdown for two weeks, we must bring in such measures for Mumbai… unless there are legal enforcements, people don’t adhere to norms voluntarily,” he said. “A crowd of at least a lakh is thronging Juhu beach every weekend. We are not telling hawkers shouldn’t sell, but perhaps not post 6.30pm for the next few weeks,” he added. Karnik said the city could follow Kalyan-Dombivli where non-essential shops cannot operate for more than six days and beyond 7pm. The task force has submitted a set of recommendations vis-à-vis Mumbai. “We are clear people who have no essential reason to step out of their homes simply shouldn’t. There could be a temporary curb on morning walkers or people going to parks or just gathering in their neighbourhoods particularly during the weekends,” said intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, also a member of the panel. He said people must get back to working virtually and offices should adhere to the 50% attendance norm. The task force has always emphasised on increasing testing numbers which the city’s municipal corporation has been successful in achieving, said Dr Pandit. The city’s daily testing touched a high of 40,000 on Wednesday. “There is room to be more aggressive and push it to 60,000. Simply, by increasing testing, the positivity rate could be brought down from 15.6% to 12% on Wednesday,” Pandit added. Former KEM dean Dr Avinash Supe, who also heads the Covid death committee, said more constraints are needed and social activities cut down. He too said curtailed timing for non-essential shops and markets should be possible without impacting economic activity. Another task force member, who didn’t wish to be quoted, said night curfews should be considered at all cost. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, however, said as deaths are under control, BMC’s key strategy would be to test more and find as many positive cases for now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-task-force-says-slow-down-people-stop-night-activity/articleshow/81677236.cms||Sumitra Debroy

CCI, which took up the matter on a suo motu basis, said the investigation will be carried out by its Director-General, as it sought a final report in the next 60 days. CCI’s harsh stance comes close on the heels of the objections raised by the IT ministry on the proposed privacy update that, among other things, seeks to share business communication of WhatsApp users with parent Facebook. CCI expressed displeasure on the development, especially the fact that users have not been given an ‘opt-out’ option from the update as was given earlier. It said that WhatsApp may be taking the benefit of its dominant position in the instant messaging business to initiate such a move where users need to accept the update by May 15. “Given the pronounced network effects it enjoys, and the absence of any credible competitor in the instant messaging market in India, WhatsApp appears to be in a position to compromise quality in terms of protection of individualised data and can deem it unnecessary to even retain the user-friendly alternatives such as ‘opt-out’ choices, without the fear of erosion of its user base,” CCI said. “On a careful and thoughtful consideration of the matter, the conduct of WhatsApp in sharing of users’ personalised data with other Facebook companies, in a manner that is neither fully transparent nor based on voluntary and specific user consent, appears prima facie unfair to users. The purpose of such sharing appears to be beyond users’ reasonable and legitimate expectations regarding quality, security and other relevant aspects of the service for which they register on WhatsApp. In a statement, a spokesperson for WhatsApp said, “We look forward to engaging with the CCI. WhatsApp remains committed to protecting people’s personal communications with end-to-end encryption and providing transparency about how these new optional business features work.” CCI, however, felt that sharing of business communication data with Facebook may itself raise competition concerns. “Such data concentration may itself raise competition concerns where it is perceived as a competitive advantage. The impugned conduct of data-sharing by WhatsApp with Facebook apparently amounts to degradation of non-price parameters of competition viz. quality which result in objective detriment to consumers, without any acceptable justification.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/blow-for-whatsapp-as-cci-puts-lens-on-privacy-update/articleshow/81679406.cms||Pankaj Doval

They also cried foul over NU administration’s failure to start helplines for them like last year. Though NU’s ten helplines remained busy or calls were unanswered throughout the summer 2020 exams, it helped at least some harried students facing glitches in papers. In the absence of helplines, students uploaded their grievances on social media expressing apprehension over use of web-based links. Even many teachers supported their contentions, as NU didn’t provide them training in using web-link based technology like last year. They had just become familiar with the mobile app based exams and suddenly they were made to use a new system, which would take time to understand. Both students and teachers told TOI they were apprehensive of power failures during the papers, as NU has failed to say what happens in such a situation. “Since it’s a web-based exam, constant internet connectivity would be needed. In case of breakdown, whether we need to start again or continue from where we left off,” they asked, adding there were no such problems while appearing through the app. Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable clarified that NU would be launching helplines by Wednesday evening. However, nothing was uploaded on the website even as exams commence from Thursday. Stressing that examinees must have good internet connectivity, Sable said NU would be proctoring the entire paper till end. “They wouldn’t face any issues if there’s a breakdown of power. The web-link would restart from where they have left. If they have solved 20 of 40 questions, they can start from 21st question when power supply or connectivity resumes. This time, they would see one question at a time with answers,” he said, adding that he had uploaded a video on NU website for students to provide answers to all such queries. Exams scheduled on Thursday from 8 to 11 am* First shift – BSc, BCom & BBA fifth sem * Second shift – BE 7th sem & BSc (Home Sci) 5th sem * Third shift – BA & BALLB 5th sem Dates & no of students appearing in NU examsPhase ---------- Dates -------------------------- Examinees First ------------- March 25-April 5 ----------- 69,000 Second ------------- April 5-April 14 ----------- 72,000 Third ------------- April 15-April 25 ----------- 70,000 (Students numbers may increase as form filling underway) Dos & Don’ts for students for online examination#Dos: * Charge laptop, smartphone, tablet * Check power plugs & electrical connectivity * Ensure proper internet connectivity for devices * Properly light exam room & maintain silence * Keep admission card ready at time of paper * Ensure webcam & microphone working properly * Keep webcam’s focus on face & clearly visible * Keep a water bottle on table before start of exam * Appear for mock exams, which is mandatory for all * Make yourself available for entire exam duration * Check timetable on https://www.nagpuruniversity.ac.in # Don’ts: * Try to navigate from main screen * Talk to anyone or refer to any material * Start exam from multiple devices at a time * Leave your place for any reason during paper * Cover your face with hair, clothing (mask), hands * Use headphones, ear-buds, or any other equipment * Have background noise/voices/music or TV * Wear sunglasses or communicate with any person * Entertain any other people in the room. * Use applications like MS Teams, Zoom, or Google Meet||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-exams-today-students-jittery-over-connectivity-issues-no-helplines/articleshow/81676337.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The new buoy called Continuously Homing Submerged Autonomous Tsunami Underwater System (CHATUR) lies silent at 300m depth in the water and pops up to the surface only when its sensors detect abnormal water pressure on the seafloor. The buoy have been undergoing tests in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea since December 2019 and researchers are now ready for technology transfer. R Venkatesan, head of Ocean Observation Systems, NIOT, said the new system transmits data only when the sensors detect an unusual change in water pressure. “We have completed testing of the prototype. We will soon transfer the technology to industry. We will deploy it in the oceans in addition to the existing systems,” he said. At present, India has tsunami buoys at strategic locations close to the Andaman-Sumatra subduction fault in the Bay of Bengal and Makran fault in the Arabian Sea. They collect data and transmit on a daily basis to the Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre in INCOIS, Hyderabad, and mission control centre at NIOT through INMARSAT. Chatur has four main subsystems — bottom pressure recorder, extendable buoy system, motorised winch and brake system, and position mooring with acoustic release mechanism. Researchers said Chatur activates when it measures abnormal pressure associated with change in the height of the water column. The sensor sends out an acoustic message to the transceiver in the extendable buoy system, lying dormant at 300m, which then signals the winch to lift the buoy to the sea surface. The buoy then transmits the data through satellite to the servers on land. Once the pressure returns to normal, the winch pulls the buoy back to its original position underwater. Researchers said this operation of the buoy only on demand reduces acts of vandalism and reduces the mooring load because of relatively lower subsurface water currents. The instruments suffer less biofouling and hence reduced maintenance and the low ambient temperatures underwater also protects the life of the electronic systems, hence making them fit for many other strategic applications. In all, 31 buoy vandalism events were reported in the Indian Ocean during 2006-2010.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/city-lab-develops-advanced-buoys-for-tsunami-detection/articleshow/81676311.cms||U Tejonmayam

---||Goa||Sawant assures residential homes for migrant workers in industrial estates||PORVORIM: While trying to appease all sections of Goa, chief minister Pramod Sawant ensured that he did not skip Goa Inc. He earmarked Rs 10 crore to improve industrial infrastructure, a demand that Goa’s industry bodies have been making for years. Sawant said he would constitute a task force to examine and propose a viable solution for rejuvenating sick or closed industrial units. Sawant also proposed to improve local transport connectivity to industries and to create residential hostels for migrant workers and female staff in industrial estates. He also proposed to issue health cards to all the migrant workforce. These were some of the points on the wishlist submitted by the Goa State Industries Association (GSIA). He said that he proposes to extend employment subsidies to units in the service sector hiring Goans, which commence operations after April 1, 2021, with the scheme being extended to the cashew industry. He said that the Goa Investment Promotion Board has granted in-principle approval to 196 projects which comprises 79 new manufacturing units, 52 new hospitality projects, 13 new service sector projects, 48 projects of expansion of existing manufacturing units and four projects from existing hospitality units. “The total investment expected from all these units is Rs 15,780 crore and the employment potential is 37,247 people,” Sawant said. Meanwhile, Sawant also made a budgetary provision of Rs 7.5 cr for Goa Industrial Development Corporation to pay past dues to 23 respective local bodies. The Associate Fellow of Industrial Health organised by DGFASLI, Mumbai, and a one-month course for supervisors working in hazardous industries will be revived. A provision of Rs 2 cr has been made to obtain Geographical Indication (GI) tag for the Mankurad mango, bebinca, Taleigao brinjal, coconut feni, Kunbi saree and saat-shiro bhendi. While the budget is full of promises, given the current poor fiscal position of the state, the delivery seems doubtful. We expected the government to come out with some bold initiatives to resurrect the Covid-ravaged economy. However, barring some token, industry once again has been ignored The budget has really been a comprehensive one. Overall, it has addressed several growth indicators put forward by CII to help the economy pivot towards an accelerated recovery, revision of the start-up policy with non-IT services and the various tourism related initiatives||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-assures-residential-homes-for-migrant-workers-in-industrial-estates/articleshow/81677952.cms||---

The gaushalas have decided to provide home delivery of gokasth to people for Rs 2,100. This is being done following the announcement of deputy mayor of JMC-Greater Puneet Karnawat who said Holika Dahan in around 500 places in the city will be done using ‘gokasth’. Vishnu Aggarwal, member of Shri Narayan Dham Gaushala, said they had circulated their phone numbers across the city and started receiving orders. “Last year too we took the initiative, but this year with the help of JMC-Greater, more orders are coming. In Rs 2,100, around 150 kg gokasth will be transported anywhere in the city,” said Aggarwal. Shri Krishna Balram Trust (Hingonia Gaushala) has 30,000 kg of gaukasth and 20,000 kg of kande (fuel made from cow dung) in their stock and will be made available to the people on demand. Manager of Hingonia Ragu Pati Das Prabhu said they will provide gokasth to people, but transportation will be provided by other gaushalas. “We have participated for the first time. We have ample stocks of gokasth and the transportation will be provided by other four gaushalas,” said Raghu Pati Das Prabhu. Pinjrapol Gaushala in Sanganer had already received 50 orders and is expecting more soon. Karnwat said, “We called a meeting of all the five gaushalas members and the rates were fixed. We are expecting to complete our 500 holka dahan target with the help of gaukasth this year and from next year we will expand it further.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/city-set-for-eco-friendly-holika-dahan/articleshow/81677234.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Harappan people ate multigrain, high-protein ‘laddoos’, says study||LUCKNOW: A scientific study of the material found during an excavation in Rajasthan has revealed that the Harappan people used to consume high-protein, multigrain ‘laddoos’ (food balls) around 4,000 years ago, which indicates that the inhabitants practised agriculture under good (wet) climatic conditions. At least seven ‘laddoos’ were discovered in 2017 during the excavation of a Harappan archaeological site at 4MSR (earlier known as Binjor) in western part of Rajasthan (near Pakistan border) between 2014 and 2017. The study, jointly conducted by the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences (BSIP), Lucknow, and Archeological Survey of India (ASI), New Delhi, was recently published in the ‘Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports’ by Elsevier. “Seven similar big-size brown ‘laddoos’, two figurines of bulls and a hand-held copper adze (a tool similar to an axe, used for cutting or shaping wood) were excavated by ASI at the Harappan site in Anupgarh district of Rajasthan. These food balls, dating back to around 2600 BCE, were found well preserved as a hard structure had fallen in such a manner that it acted as a roof over them and saved them from getting crushed. Had they been broken, the 'laddoos' would have decayed entirely but since these were in contact with the mud, some of the internal organic matter and other green constituents were protected," senior BSIP scientist Rajesh Agnihotri said. He said the most peculiar thing about these ‘laddoos’ was that when it came in contact with water, the slurry turned purple. ASI handed over aliquots (samples) of these food balls to BSIP for scientific analysis. “At first, we thought that these food balls, excavated near the banks of Ghaggar (erstwhile Saraswati), had some connection with occult activities since figurines and adze were also found in close proximity,” Agnihotri said. “We were intrigued by their shape and size as they were clearly manmade. This curiosity led us to explore their composition. We initially presumed it could be a non-vegetarian food. However, primary microscopic investigations carried out by BSIP senior scientist Anjum Farooqui hinted that these were composed of barley, wheat, chickpea and a few other oilseeds. As the early Indus Valley people were mainly agriculturists, the composition of these food balls with mainly vegetarian items with high protein content made sense,” he added. The presence of pulses, starch and protein was further confirmed by discovery of significant excesses of magnesium, calcium and potassium. “These laddoos had cereal and pulses, and moong dal dominated the ingredients,” said senior scientist Anjum Farooqui. Full organic geochemistry of the food balls was later conducted at BSIP and National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI), Lucknow. A team of nine scientists and archaeologists from the two institutes concluded that the presence of seven food balls along with typical Harappan tools/items hinted that Harappan people made offerings, performed rituals and consumed multi-nutritive compact ‘laddoos’ as a food supplement for instant nutrition . The presence of bull figurines, adze and a Harappan seal in the vicinity of these seven food balls signifies that humans revered all these items due to their utility and importance to them. “The study provides important insights into types of food grain used in making food balls, which reveal contemporary farming practices by Harappan people. This scientific finding appears to be unique and opens up avenues for more intrusive scientific research in archaeology to reconstruct the unwritten history of India and its glorious past,” Agnihotri said. Food balls were used to perform rituals: ASI The discovery of food balls, along with figurines of bulls and copper adze, suggests that Harappan people used these items to perform some kind of rituals. Director (excavations), Institute of Archaeology at the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), New Delhi, Sanjay Manjul said, “After the scientific study, we can say that this is the first evidence to show that Harappan people performed some rituals on the banks of river Saraswati (now extinct). Though the nature of the ritual is not clear, it could be akin to ‘pind daan’ (offering of homage and food to ancestors)." “When we found the food balls at 4MSR Bijnor, it appeared to be a site where rituals were performed. We found terracotta bulls, painted pots, bones and adze from there,” Manjul said, adding that excavations were carried out in three phases in 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17. “The food balls appeared like a lump of soil but its colour was a bit different so we picked it up and sent it to BSIP for chemical analysis. The study confirmed it was a food ball,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/harappan-people-ate-multigrain-high-protein-laddoos-says-study/articleshow/81677957.cms||Mohita Tewari

In its 60th year of Liberation, Pratapsingh Rane completed 50 years as a member of the Goa assembly—the longest serving legislator of the state and among one of the longest in the country. In his 50-year career, Rane has donned many hats. He has been a minister and the longest serving chief minister, ahead of heavyweights like first chief minister Dayanand Bandodkar and Manohar Parrikar. His experience and integrity even made Parrikar give him the speaker’s post in 2000, despite Rane representing Congress. Rane first got elected on MGP ticket in 1972 and has since won 10 more elections. He joined Congress in the late 70s and has remained loyal to the party since then. There are politicians who have enjoyed longer stints in state assemblies than the Poriem MLA—M Karunanidhi, K M Mani and Jyoti Basu. All three are no longer alive. Then there is Ganpatrao Deshmukh, who was a member of the Maharashtra legislative assembly for 11 terms across 59 years. He retired last year. Former Kerala chief minister and Congress stalwart Oommen Chandy completed 50 years as MLA last year. He’s now ready for yet another election. And then there is Pratapsingh Rane in Goa, who is 82, and is going strong.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-goas-60th-year-of-liberation-rane-marks-his-own-milestone-50-years-as-mla/articleshow/81677943.cms||---

There were 20 manned level crossings (LCs) in the erstwhile single-line section. During the planning of the project it was decided to eliminate 11 manned LCs by constructing nine limited height subways (LHS) and remaining LCs by connecting the access road through the adjacent LCs. The doubling work was carried out in two phases. In the first phase, a newly-electrified track (downline, Ambalapuzha-Haripad) was laid and commissioned in March 2020. To facilitate the second phase works, traffic through the old single-line section was suspended and the track regraded with extension of LHS, wherever manned LCs existed. The upgraded track (upline, Haripad-Alappuzha) has been completed and commissioned on Wednesday. Train No. 06316 Kochuveli-Mysuru Daily Special was the first passenger train to run on the newly-commissioned track. Public residing in the vicinity of railway tracks between Ambalapuzha and Haripad were requested to avoid crossing/strolling on railway track as trains will start running (in maximum permissible speed) on both tracks from Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/track-doubling-works-completed/articleshow/81676322.cms||---

He said Goa will be at a loss if all Goans are not on the same page over Mhadei. “Taking a stand when you are a part of the government and then switching positions when you are not with the government, such politics can prove fatal for the state. The politics being played over Mhadei in the state should stop and in my view that all Goans should come together on the issue,” he said. He added that it is because his government fully understands the seriousness over the Mhadei matter that, during my tenure, a special application has been made in the SC over the neighbouring state’s attempts to illegally divert the flow of the Mhadei. “A separate contempt petition has also been filed over the neighbouring state acting against the directives of the Supreme Court and the Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal. And therefore, the Supreme Court has formed a joint monitoring committee of three concerned states, which will inspect the site and submit its report before the SC within four weeks,” the chief minister added. The work of testing the salinity of Mhadei’s waters is also on. All these actions will help strengthen Goa’s case and help Goans get justice in the Mhadei matter, Sawant said. “From this august house, I want to let all Goans know that there will be no compromises when it comes to our rights over Mhadei,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/practice-what-you-preach-cm-to-oppn-on-mhadei/articleshow/81677985.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Officials’ connivance cannot be ruled out: CEO||Thrissur: Thrissur: Connivance of election officials cannot be ruled out in the large-scale duplication of names in electoral rolls and strict action will be taken against them, chief electoral officer Teekaram Meena has said. Lack of alertness on the part of the voters and deficiencies in the software used in the online voters’ registration system may have also contributed to the duplication of names, he said in an interview with TOI. Some voters may apply for fresh ID cards, without bothering to correct the mistakes in the cards they previously received. Similarly, when they are relocated, they may apply for fresh cards without cancelling the old ones. The online registry may accept such applications, as the software is unable to detect duplications, Meena said. “Some officials may also be indulging in multiple entry of voters, with malafide intentions, and the political parties may also be conniving in this,” he said. There were about 64 lakh double entries in the voters’ list in the state till January 2019, and it may have been brought down to about 2 lakh now, after verification. The number of double entry could run into crores in the country as a whole. The electoral rolls in the country were not purified for the last 50 years or so, and elections were going on till then by relying on the list with duplications. In Kerala, about 1.56 lakh duplications were found till November 2020 during the summary revision. But the Election Commission directed that we cannot remove the entries now as we are going for elections. This is the situation in all the five states which were going to polls. Hence, we could not put into use the ERONET software after the final voters’ list was published, Meena said. “We had received nine lakh applications for inclusion in the voters’ list, within one and a half months of the publication of the final list on January 20. Out of them, seven lakh applicants were included. The most common reason for duplications could be that the DLOs may have avoided home visits for physical verification, during the Corona period,’’ Meena said. The CEO also appreciated the efforts of Ramesh Chennithala for exposing the flaws in the list as it has helped the panel to purify the list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/officials-connivance-cannot-be-ruled-out-ceo/articleshow/81677252.cms||T Ramavarman

Pointing out that the state fiscal deficit stands at 2.96% of the GSDP, Sawant said that in the coming financial year, the government would take steps to reduce the state’s borrowings. “My government has adopted a prudent fiscal policy and kept the deficit and debt stock, related to the GSDP, at a sustainable level. The fiscal deficit maintained for the current fiscal year is at 2.96% of GSDP, which is within the prescribed norms,” said Sawant. The state’s public debt as on March 31 is projected at Rs 17,952 crore with market loans forming a major part of the public debt. The economic survey 2020-21 indicates that central loans have shown a decline while market loans have shown an increase over the years. “The earlier governments, without looking at the financial situation of the state, borrowed irresponsibly and put a burden on the state. My government has considered the situation and has taken steps to repay some of the loans and reduce the state’s financial burden,” said Sawant. Among the steps taken by the state are repayment of loans taken by the Goa State Waste Management Corporation which had a 13% interest rate and a loan taken by Sanjeevani Sugar Factory which had an interest rate of Rs 12.5%. The state government has also managed to restructure loans taken from LIC and Power Finance Corporation which had an interest rate of 12%. In order to reduce its expenditure burden, the state government also proposes to dovetail nine state government schemes with similar schemes offered by the Centre which will save Rs 200 cr of the state exchequer. “My government is in the final process of empanelment of Consultancy firms for availing maximum Central funds for various projects in the State with minimal burden on State exchequer by adopting success fee mechanism. My government is in the process of rolling out new 49 centrally sponsored schemes which will be implemented for the first time and I expect to get an assistance to the tune of Rs. 772 crores during 2021-22,” said Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fiscal-deficit-at-2-96-sawant-says-govt-taking-steps-to-reduce-states-borrowings/articleshow/81677961.cms||---
---||Goa||Temperature spike a prelude to scorching summer||PANAJI: The already-scorching summer is set to get hotter. Even as the temperature is likely to rise by 2-3 degrees C till Friday, the India meteorological department (IMD) has forecast a hotter summer for the Konkan region, including Goa. “It is forecast that for the Konkan area, the seasonal average maximum temperature can be up to 0.25 degrees C higher than normal, and the minimum temperature will be around 0.5 degrees C higher than normal,” states IMD’s seasonal outlook for this summer. Reports state that the the Ratnagiri region towards the north Konkan zone has already started experiencing higher temperatures that have satisfied the heat wave criteria. Goa usually experiences higher temperatures during April and May, which cause some discomfort but not the severity of a heat wave. “It is likely to remain above normal of 32.4 degrees C by two or three degrees to around 35-36 degrees C. But as per present observations, temperatures may not rise up to the criteria of a heat wave,” said Rahul M, scientist, IMD, Panaji. “The maximum temperature should rise beyond 37 degrees C and persist for at least two days to meet the parameters of a heat wave,” the IMD scientist said. But IMD meteorologists expect the rise of mercury during day and night in hinterland areas, depending on topographical conditions, by two or three degrees higher than coastal areas. However, IMD, Panaji expects temperatures during day and night to fall after March 27, as the wind direction is likely to change.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/temp-spike-a-prelude-to-scorching-summer/articleshow/81677958.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Puducherry||Give report on Aadhaar ‘data misuse’: HC to EC||CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Wednesday chided the Election Commission over its failure to probe complaints about the Puducherry unit of the BJP illegally accessing Aadhaar data and using it to reach voters in the Union territory and asked it to file a report by March 26. “A matter of serious concern has been reported by the petitioner that a prominent political party has access to personal records of citizens to undertake a political campaign. It will not do for the ECI to say cyber crimes division is conducting an investigation. When the commission is up and about in all other matters and asserts its primacy and authority, it has to look into this allegation immediately and with the degree of seriousness that it deserves,” a bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said. A Anand, president of the Democratic Youth Foundation of India’s Puducherry unit, said in his petition that local BJP candidates had obtained the mobile phone numbers of voters that are linked with Aadhaar and were using them to create WhatsApp groups in their respective constituencies for campaigning. “Multiple WhatsApp groups have been formed in the Union territory using the same phone number specifically targeting voters in respective booths and constituencies through messages,” said advocate M N Sumathy, who is representing the petitioner. When the petitioner tried to reach the administrator of one such group, he came to know there were 952 WhatsApp groups created with voter details obtained from Aadhaar data, Sumathy added. The petitioner also said that voters have been receiving calls from the BJP seeking votes with accurate details such as names, election booths and constituencies from which they will be voting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/use-of-aadhaar-data-by-bjp-to-woo-voters-hc-seeks-ec-report/articleshow/81680457.cms||Suresh Kumar

But there is only a woman candidate. While none of the recognized political parties didn’t deem it fit to field a woman candidate, the sole woman candidate in the district was fielded by a registered party - Naam Tamizhar Katchi.The Nilgiris hasn’t sent a woman representative to the state assembly so far. The only woman to win an election in the hill retreat was Akkamma Devi, who contested from the Nilgiris parliamentary constituency in the 1962 Lok Sabha elections. Known as ‘daughter of the mountain’, she was the first Badaga woman to graduate from a college. She was fielded by the Indian National Congress.While the Nilgiris is one of the districts in the state where women voters outnumber men, it isn’t known why the recognized political parties are shying away from fielding a woman candidate from at least a constituency. DMK party cadre, who didn’t want to be identified, said, “In politics, women are not treated equal to men. As in the local body elections, seats should be reserved for women in the assembly elections too. Lack of encouragement from families is another reason for women not taking up politics seriously.”According to a source, a woman member of a national party had expressed her interest to contest from Ooty constituency on the party ticket. “Despite being a fairly familiar face in the constituency, the party denied her the ticket.”A district functionary of the AIADMK said the candidates were selected at the party’s high level based on several criteria.Dr S Suresh Babu, MNM candidate from the Ooty constituency, said, “Generally, women are not coming forward to take part in active politics. For that matter, general public are hesitant to join politics, as a stigma is attached to it. Politics is a different proposition altogether. Not only women, the general public should also enter politics with some ideology and change the existing proposition to see more women in politics in future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/recognized-parties-deny-tickets-to-women-in-nilgiris/articleshow/81677248.cms||---

Every year during Holi, lots of parties and events were organised where many gulal gota makers were called to showcase their art.“It was good business then. But this year, due to the pandemic, no tourists have arrived or no events held. Till last year, I had to work overtime but wasn’t able to complete the order. This year, we would be glad if we manage to recover whatever we invested,” said Khan. The pandemic has badly affected the markets this Holi. Shopkeepers said they were not able to make even 10% of sales as compared to previous years. After Mahashivratri, shops used to be decked up with gulal and pichkaris. Many temporary shops used to encroach the sides of roads, with people thronging the market. Due following the sudden spike in cases, footfall has dipped in the market affecting the livelihoods of traders. Irfan Khan, a gulaal seller in Tripoliya market, said not even 2% sale is happening in the market. “We didn’t purchase a lot of materials this year. The entire market is quiet because of pandemic as people are worried that may be the government will ban the Holi celebrations as well,” said Khan. Deepesh Saini, a toy shopowner in Raja Park, said before the pandemic, he purchased a variety of pichkaris for Holi but this year, stocks are limited. “We are expecting that in the weekend, the market will pick up some speed. Some of us are delivering the required material at homes to provide some assistance to the customers and have a means of earning,” said Saini. Some gulaal gota makers said that living in the city for decades, they have never seen the market being this low. Even at the time of riots and curfew, the business wasn’t this slow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pandemic-takes-colour-off-holi-business/articleshow/81677257.cms||---

The victim, identified as Kusumlata Sharma (65), was living alone in the independent house. The accused has been identified as Bhavesh who came through a placement agency in Delhi and started work just two days ago. Cops are trying to identify other accused. According to Ramesh Saini, SHO, Bajaj Nagar Police station, Sharma had replaced his old servant who had gone to his native place in Bihar. “Bhavesh along with two accomplices came to Sharma’s house at 10pm on Tuesday and blindfolded her eyes while she was sitting on a chair. The trio tied her hands and threatened her to keep silence else she will be stabbed in the chest. They forced her to smell sedatives to control her. The victim didn’t smell it and acted as if she is unconscious,” he said. The report filed by the victim said that Rs 1 lakh and valuables worth Rs 6 lakh have been missing from the locker. Bhavesh knew the place where the keys of the almirah were kept. He stole cash and ornaments which was not disclosed by the police. They had left the house leaving Sharma tied on the chair. Since she had not smelled the substance, she untied her hands soon after the accused left the spot. She called the neighbours and narrated the tale. The neighbours called the police who collected forensic evidence from the spot. Sharma’s two sons live abroad with their families. “We have reached out to the placement agency and collected vital inputs on Bhavesh,” said Saini.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/domestic-help-aides-tie-up-woman-rob-cash-ornaments/articleshow/81676326.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Techie turns weekend farmer, sows seeds to secure future||Hyderabad:A software engineer from an agriculture family is turning heads with his passion for farming, toiling in his family’s farmland in Nagarkurnool district during the weekends. Top agricultural officials paid a visit to V Goverdhan Reddy’s 13-acre sandalwood farm recently to understand his approach and look at the trees themselves. “A lot of learning and research has gone into planting sandalwood. There are big benefits to reap,” Goverdhan, who works for an MNC from Monday to Friday in Hyderabad, told TOI, explaining how he got into farming two years ago. According to Goverdhan’s calculations, an investment of Rs Rs 1 lakh in planting sandalwood would result in an income running into crores of rupees in 15 years. His calculations are based on the number of sandalwood trees planted in an acre of land, the present rate and the price of the precious wood after 15 years. Goverdhan does not want to keep the formula to himself. “I am willing to explain and guide anyone who wants to plant sandalwood. In fact, I have myself made a few mistakes. I do not want others planting sandalwood to repeat these mistakes,” he says. Recently, agriculture commissioner B Janardhan Reddy and local agriculture officials visited Goverdhan’s farm and saw for themselves how the software engineer-cum-farmer was taking care of his sandalwood farm. After his father’s death, Goverdhan dreamt of becoming a software engineer. He joined a business school and added an MBA degree to his resume. He worked for a couple of years and did courses in software. The farm then beckoned again. From 20 acres of farmland his family owned, he began sandalwood cultivation in 13 acres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/techie-turns-weekend-farmer-sows-seeds-to-secure-future/articleshow/81677263.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Lucknow||After encephalitis, UP CM Yogi Adityanath vows to eradicate tuberculosis by 2025||LUCKNOW: After bringing encephalitis under control, the state government on Wednesday pledged to make Uttar Pradesh free of tuberculosis (TB) by 2025, reports Shailvee Sharda. Addressing a programme to mark World TB Day at Vidyagyan School in Sitapur, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said, “Tuberculosis is a threat but it can be defeated. If Uttar Pradesh can beat polio and combat encephalitis, TB can also be eradicated.” The CM also launched facilities to strengthen the on-going battle against TB which affects more than one lakh people in UP every year. He called upon public representatives, government officials, civil society and people from all walks of life to join hands in battle against TB. “The least one can do is to adopt a child who has tuberculosis. This doesn’t mean that one will have to bring that child home. It involves tracking the health of children, asking them if they are taking medicines on time, enquiring from parents if their entitled nutritional support amount is regular or not and giving the child hope that they can overcome the disease by following the advice of doctors,” he said. Yogi also appealed to people undergoing treatment for TB to ensure that they complete the course of treatment which is provided free of cost at government health centres. “No one should be required to motivate the patient. You must fight back on your own. Breaking the course of medicine is an open invitation to a worsened form of the disease and life-threatening complications must be highlighted by the family, society and health system,” he said. The CM emphasised that the battle against TB could not be won unless private sector participates more aggressively. The CM virtually inaugurated the Regional TB Programme Management Unit in Gorakhpur and dedicated line probe assay (technology to decipher drug resistant TB) labs in Gorakhpur and Meerut Medical Colleges, 415 Trunat machines for faster TB testing in districts and 25 digital X-ray machines in districts. He also felicitated district tuberculosis officers Pradeep Varshney (Rampur), Vinod Agarwal (Sonbhadra), Narendra Singh (Unnao), Deenanath Mishra (Chandauli) and Vivek Srivastava (Maharajganj) for exemplary work against TB in 2020. The foundation of drug ware houses was also laid in 21 districts including Sitapur, Mirzapur, Sambhal, Pratapgarh, Hapur, Ballia, Fatehpur, Basti, Rae Bareli, Farrukhabad, Auraiya, Barabanki and Varanasi, among others. ‘70k PMAY houses built in Sitapur’: CM Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said that Sitapur district got record houses built under the PM Awas Yojana. “As many as 7,01,594 houses have been built under the scheme till March 1, 2021. Out of these, 70,000 houses were constructed in Sitapur alone,” he said. ‘Kayakalp transforming primary schools’: The CM said the image of government schools in the state was changing with the progress of Mission Kayakalp. “Under ‘Operation Kayakalp’, over 1.58 lakh schools have been developed and equipped with modern facilities,” he said, adding that enrolment of students in primary schools increased because of the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-encephalitis-cm-yogi-vows-to-eradicate-tb-by-25/articleshow/81678015.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The incident triggered a 10-km snarl between Deoli and Sarwar for 18 hours. The fire in the truck was seen from as far as 6-7 km away and the sound of exploding cylinders forced residents living in nearby houses to run for safer places. Traffic resumed after a team of experts cleared the road and removed burnt cylinders around 2 pm on Wednesday. The driver sustained minor injuries and is undergoing treatment in a Deoli hospital. Fear of explosion halted firemen from action for hours. They swung into action around dawn after the intensity of the fire became low. “Prima facie it appears that the truck ferrying cylinders from Nasirabad to Ramgangmandi in Kota was hit by a lightening. Fortunately, no casualty was reported. Traffic was diverted late in the night and resumed only after the road was declared safe for commuting this afternoon,” said SP Bhilwara Vikas Sharma. A team from the gas plant including experts arrived at the venue at 6 am and collected burnt and semi burnt cylinders. “The fear of an explosion of unburnt cylinders collected by the team is still very high. They were kept at a secluded place off the main highway. The team is evaluating the unburnt cylinders,” said Sharma. Incidents of debris of cylinders reaching nearby hotels were reported. “The fire could be seen from 7 to 8 kilometres,” said a witness. Driver Sartaj Meena (35), a resident of Bijeta village of Nasirabad, suffered minor burn injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/450-lpg-cylinders-explode-after-lightning-strikes-truck/articleshow/81680901.cms||---

At least six others in the top bracket have decided similarly while two students in this bracket have decided to set up a start-up firm to give free legal aid to the underprivileged. NUJS has completed its placements for the academic year, which comes to an end in July, completely in the virtual mode, and though the pandemic has had an impact on the offers “qualitatively”, the university announced a 100% success. Topper Subhrojyoti Mookherjee bagged admissions in Oxford, Cambridge, London University and London School of Economics. “This is definitely a first and we are proud to have a student who thinks so differently,” said university VC Nirmal Kanti Chakraborty. The second highest scorer, Parmeet Singh, has been offered a seat at National University of Singapore. At least six others have taken admission for masters programmes at Cambridge University, London University and Pennsylvania State University. “I am also proud of the two woman students who have scored extremely well but have decided to set up a start-up firm to give legal aid to undertrials who cannot afford lawyers and villagers in need,” Chakraborty said. There were a total of 120 students in the batch and the highest offer of Rs 22 lakh was lower than last year’s Rs 30 lakh. “Every year the placements are done on campus with the recruiters meeting candidates face-to-face. But this year the placements were co-ordinated by a team via virtual meets. That was bound to have an impact,” Chakraborty said. There are some who have also opted out of placements to prepare for the civil services examination and at least 10 are joining the Supreme Court, the Delhi HC and the Calcutta HC. “These students chose the courtroom instead of corporate houses,” the VC said. The top recruiters this time include law firms, like Amarchand Mangaldas, AZV, Trilegal Law Firm, Nishith Desai Law Firm, Khaitan and Co, Bharucha and Partners, Indus Law, and others. Corporate houses that made multiple offers included ICICI Bank, ITC, Gail, Tata AIG among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nujs-top-scorers-skip-placements-for-academics-free-legal-aid-firm/articleshow/81676381.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Coimbatore||MNM entry to make AIADMK-DMK fight for Pollachi tough||Will the AIADMK be able to continue its winning streak from Pollachi is the question looming large with the main opposition party DMK raking up the infamous sexual assault case and making it a poll issue. With less than two weeks for the state to go to polls, political parties’ fortunes would also depend a lot on how they react to the people’s long-pending demand to make it a separate district.A cross-section of voters say while the Pollachi sexual assault case had weakened the AIADMK in the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, the issue was unlikely to have the same impact now.Formed in 1952, Pollachi is one of the oldest constituencies in the state. While the Congress won from the seat in the 1952, 1957 and 1962 polls, the DMK tasted victory in the 1967, 1971 and 1996 elections. The constituency has favoured the AIADMK nine times – in 1977, 1980, 1984, 1989, 1991, 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016.It’s for the fifth time the AIADMK is fielding Pollachi V Jayaraman from the constituency. In three of the four earlier outings, he had tasted victory thrice - in 2001, 2006 and 2016.The deputy assembly speaker represents the 24 Manai Telugu Chettiar community, which along with schedule caste, forms a sizable chunk of the vote bank. The DMK candidate, however, belongs to the Gounder community that has a major presence in the constituency.An AIADMK functionary, who didn’t want to be named, said, “This will be a tough fight for Jayaraman. Opposition party leaders have dragged his sons’ names into the Pollachi sexual assault case. Moreover, the CBI have arrested the party functionaries for their involvement in the case. While the DMK had used the case to tarnish the image of Jayaraman and turn the tables in favour of it in the 2019 parliamentary elections, the issue will hopefully have lesser impact this time.”The entry of Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) is, meanwhile, likely to give the Dravidian majors a tough time. With its president Kamal Hassan promising to take steps to turn Pollachi into a new district during the campaign in January, he is likely to have already created a feel-good factor among the electorate. Only time would tell how much of that would turn into votes. While both the AIADMK candidate Pollachi V Jayaraman and the DMK candidate Dr K Varadharajan have promised the electorate to take steps to announce Pollachi as a separate district, they feel the ruling party has not genuinely recognized their demand.It is to be noted that people from Udumalpet and Madathukulam also wanted to become part of Pollachi district, instead of Tirupur, as Pollachi is geographically closer.Bureaucrats had earlier advised the AIADMK government against forming a district out of Pollachi as that would shrink the administrative area of Coimbatore district. As a district, Pollachi would seemingly encompass Pollachi, Kinathukadavu, Anaimalai, Valparai, Madathukulam and Udumalpet taluks.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 450 LPG cylinders explode after lightning strikes truck||AJMER/JAIPUR: Around 450 domestic LPG cylinders exploded for hours after the truck carrying them was hit by a lightning near Tikad village on Jaipur-Kota highway on Tuesday. The incident triggered a 10-km snarl between Deoli and Sarwar for 18 hours. The fire in the truck was seen from as far as 6-7 km away and the sound of exploding cylinders forced residents living in nearby houses to run for safer places. Traffic resumed after a team of experts cleared the road and removed burnt cylinders around 2 pm on Wednesday. The driver sustained minor injuries and is undergoing treatment in a Deoli hospital. Fear of explosion halted firemen from action for hours. They swung into action around dawn after the intensity of the fire became low. “Prima facie it appears that the truck ferrying cylinders from Nasirabad to Ramgangmandi in Kota was hit by a lightening. Fortunately, no casualty was reported. Traffic was diverted late in the night and resumed only after the road was declared safe for commuting this afternoon,” said SP Bhilwara Vikas Sharma. A team from the gas plant including experts arrived at the venue at 6 am and collected burnt and semi burnt cylinders. “The fear of an explosion of unburnt cylinders collected by the team is still very high. They were kept at a secluded place off the main highway. The team is evaluating the unburnt cylinders,” said Sharma. Incidents of debris of cylinders reaching nearby hotels were reported. “The fire could be seen from 7 to 8 kilometres,” said a witness. Driver Sartaj Meena (35), a resident of Bijeta village of Nasirabad, suffered minor burn injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/450-lpg-cylinders-explode-after-lightning-strikes-truck/articleshow/81677266.cms||---

While work of hotmixing 142km of national highways will be completed before the onset of monsoon, another Rs 100 core has been earmarked as area development fund for all MLAS to “ensure developmental works are carried out smoothly in their constituencies”. “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, new infrastructure works could not be taken up due to financial and workforce constraints. However, with the economy back on track, I now propose to hotmix all roads of the state lying in bad condition,” Sawant said. Of the new works to be taken up, construction of the long-pending new bus stand for Mapusa is on the cards. Four projects have been identified by the state government to be completed and commissioned “on a war footing before the monsoon”. While of these, the new high court complex at Porvorim is already set to be inaugurated later this week, the others include construction of headquarters for the commissioner of commercial taxes, Panaji, Ashram School at Moshiphond in Poinguinim, and bus stand and mini depot in the CM’s constituency at Sakhali. Meanwhile, Goa Infrastructure Development Corporation will get a capital outlay of Rs 450 crore, as per the budget announcement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/roads-to-be-hotmixed-within-4-mths-rs-600cr-for-maintenance/articleshow/81678026.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Water scarcity grips many zones of Ranthambore Tiger Reserve||JAIPUR: Even before the summers have arrived, water crisis has gripped Ranthambore Tiger Reserve ( RTR), especially the outer zones where most of the ponds have dried up. A recent picture of pregnant tigress T-114 made it evident that wildlife in many pockets including Zones 7,8,9 and10 are in need of water. Though, forest administration has re-filled the artificial waterholes, a regular exercise is required to prevent the animals from venturing out. A forest staff, who wished not to be named said, “In the outer zone, there are 8 natural waterbodies, out of which 4 have dried up. The artificial waterholes are being recharged using tankers.” Along with tigress T-114, three more big cats including T-108, T-58 and T-99 are living in the region. Environmentalists alleged that Ranthambore officials are focusing on VIP zones such as 3 and 4, which generate higher revenue. “As mostly VIP tourists prefer zone 3-4, the forest staff’s focus remains to maintain these areas. It should pay equal attention in all the areas,” said a source, who send a letter to TOI on this issue. Experts warned in such a situation, many wild animals including big cats can stray into human habitations in search of water. “In the absence of ingesting, water usually forces wild animals including big cats to venture into human habitats to quench their thirst, resulting in man-animal conflicts. Last year, a young tiger was spotted near a hand-pump outside the reserve. As these big cats are living on the periphery, the forest administration should put extra efforts maintain the adequate water supply.” Forest officials, however, claimed that water tanker supply has been started as per the requirement. “We are monitoring the waterholes and supply will be maintained.” As per the estimation in peak summers last year, 25-30 water tankers were required per day. Meanwhile, a senior official at Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) said, “So far, there is no water scarcity. ICICI Bank under corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme will instal solar water pumps.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/water-scarcity-grips-many-zones-of-rbore/articleshow/81677269.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||In CPM, MVR now prevails over EMS||In the 1984 parliament elections, late Congress leader K Karunakaran decided to go for an experiment in Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha constituency. He decided to pitch A Charles, a member of the Nadar community with no political background, against A Neelalohithadasa Nadar of LDF. To everyone's surprise, Charles won. What turned out to be the biggest embarrassment for LDF, especially for CPM supremo EMS Namboodiripad, was not the failure of its candidate but the fact that Kerala Varma Raja who contested under the banner of Hindu Munnani secured 19.80 percent of the polled votes. “EMS was very shocked that Hindu Munnani candidate got so many votes. In the erstwhile Thiruvananthapuram East assembly constituency, a section of which is now part of Nemom assembly constituency, Rama Varma Raja came second pushing Neelalohithadasa Nadar to third position. The main campaigner and helmsman for Raja’s election was none other than Kummanam Rajasekharan,” recalls Jacob George, political observer. By then, Kummanam had attracted attention through his key role in the Nilackal protests against a Christian sect setting up a church close to the base camp of Sabarimala. But more importantly, the Nemom result set in motion a chain of extremely significant events within CPM. “EMS was very upset with the increased vote share of Hindu Munnani candidate. He found that it was the growth of Muslim communalism promoted by certain political parties that became the catalyst for the growth of Hindu communalism", says Jacob. EMS argued that no communal parties should be there in LDF. But, CPM strongman and popular leader MV Raghavan strongly stood for expanding the LDF by including Kerala Congress (M) and Muslim League. MVR presented an alternative policy document at the state conference demanding that LDF should be expanded by including Kerala Congress (M) and Muslim League. But, EMS made an emotional speech at the meeting and the alternative policy introduced by Raghavan was voted out. Later, this rift grew subsequently leading to the expulsion of Raghavan from CPM. More than three decades later when Kummanam Rajasekharan contests from Nemom, Muraleedharan, son of K Karunakaran, has been roped in as the UDF candidate. The election to Nemom assembly constituency has become a prestige issue for all three fronts. In 2016, BJP candidate from Nemom K Rajagopal sprung a surprise by opening an account for the party in Kerala assembly. “The increasing mass base of BJP in the state has instilled a sense of insecurity in the minds of secular people as well as minorities. So, both LDF and UDF have to woo the secular voters and minorities,” said N M Pearson, political observer. “The Congress was very fast to sense the damage and give a message that the party is the one which is at the forefront of the fight against BJP in Kerala. The hype regarding Congress fielding a mighty candidate against BJP in Nemom made the constituency a symbol of the political fight in the whole state,” Pearson said. After more than three decades, as Nemom once again hogs the spotlight, the political alignments reveal that EMS's original ideological position has been reversed. Kerala Congress (M), which EMS wanted to be kept away, joined LDF. Indian National League (INL) with which LDF had been making electoral understanding in the past several years formally joined the LDF fold. RSP joined UDF by snapping decades-long ties with left parties and Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) which had switched over to UDF rejoined LDF. “Now power has replaced all political values. All parties now claim that we are less corrupt or less communal compared to others. There is only quantitative difference not any qualitative distinction,” said J Prabhash, political analyst.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/in-cpm-mvr-now-prevails-over-ems/articleshow/81677279.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The draft vision document may be sent to the prime minister’s office for a final nod. “Grand Ayodhya is the dream project of the Uttar Pradesh government and is top priority for the Centre too. The PMO may be interested to vet the vision document, but we are yet to receive intimation,” said vice-chairman of Ayodhya Development Authority (ADA) , Vishal Singh. The development authority along with three consultant firms — Canada-based multinational firm LEA Associates South Asia Private Ltd and two Indian firms, L&T and Kukreja Architects — is working round-the-clock since the second fortnight of February to make the framework error-free. Talking to TOI, Singh, said, “A macro vision is possible through micro analysis and survey of land to the minutest detail. We are working in coordination with the consultants to chalk out the blueprint soon. The vision document envisages development of not just the temple town, mutts and ancient temples, but also adjacent districts of Ayodhya. Opinions of 500 people, including residents and experts are being included in the document.” In February, Ayodhya Development Authority finalised three nodal firms to chalk out the blueprint for developing Ayodhya into a world-class city. Sources said, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has set a deadline to develop infrastructure projects in Ayodhya, however the date has not been made public. “Consultant firms are conducting surveys, evaluating demand and gap, identifying stakeholders through consultation, while keeping intact the religious character of the temple town,” said the ADA vice-chairman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ayodhya-vision-docu-by-june-in-sync-with-temple/articleshow/81678028.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

A total of 1,252 recipients — 1,006 in the first category and 246 in the second — got their first doses. Till now, the city has inoculated 80,465 recipients out of its total target of 1.5 lakh in Phase 3. As many as 52 session sites were set up in private facilities. With Wednesday being a regular immunisation day, government facilities did not set up any sites, which was the reason behind the overall low turnout, said Gurugram chief medical officer Virender Yadav. “At present, we are preparing for April 1 when we will start inoculation of people who are 45 years and above. We are also planning to create more session sites in the coming days,” he added. As per the 2011 census, the target for phase 4 will be around three lakh in the city. “Keeping in view the present scenario, we will have to inoculate about two lakh people after April 1. Hence, the session sites are likely to increase to 200. The irregular immunisation sites will be added for vaccination. We will create a routine for each week where sites can be created in these centres,” the CMO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-sees-vax-phase-3s-second-lowest-turnout/articleshow/81678062.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Double mutation variant not linked to surge yet||Pune: Nearly 15-20% of 1,600 Covid samples sent from the state for genome sequencing have been found with a variant of SARS-CoV-2 that has a double mutation.The double variant has a combination of two mutations — E484Q and L452R. The E484Q mutation has been detected in Maharashtra before and the L452R was found in patients in California, where experts believe it caused higher Covid spread.But director of the National Centre for Disease Control Dr Sujit Singh said, so far, no link has been established to say mutations alone have been responsible for the Covid-19 spike in some states. “There are various other reasons behind a surge,” he said.Genome sequencing of 223 samples from Mumbai has found the presence of the UK strain in 22 so far. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said all 22 patients have been treated and discharged. “We haven’t been told of any other variant or mutation being found in Mumbai so far,” said Kakani, adding that the results pertained to samples collected between December and February.Experts have said virus mutations are common and since December-end, at least 771 ‘variants of concern’ (VOCs) — from 10,787 positive samples — have been identified in the country. “Genomic mutation in RNA viruses is a normal phenomenon. About 5-6% mutation is considered normal,” said Singh.Singh said scientists are keen on going into the micro level to establish district-wise epidemiological linkage. “Only when these mutations are correlated with the existing public health scenario can we say that these new variants are a matter of concern. As of now, more scientific evidence is needed to say, with certainty, that the surge in Maharashtra is attributable to new virus variants,” he said.Singh said of the 1,600 samples from Maharashtra, 1,149 were from the community. Of these, 206 samples reported the double mutations (E484Q+L452R). Another 118 samples with just the L452R mutation and 112 samples with only E484 were also detected. “We are correlating the results. The mere presence of mutants does not reveal much, unless they also possess characteristics that are associated with faster transmission or severe infection.”The variant with a double mutation has now been categorised as a potential VOC.(With inputs from Sumitra Deb Roy in Mumbai)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-double-mutation-variant-not-linked-to-surge-yet/articleshow/81677389.cms||Nisha Nambiar

UP energy minister Shrikant Sharma on Wednesday asked officials of Madhyanchal distribution company to scale up registration of targeted consumers under the OTS scheme to recover dues. Sharma gave the instructions after cycling his way to conduct inspection of power distribution sub-stations in Indiranagar. In case of Lucknow, only 30% of the 1.82 lakh consumers erring on payment of around Rs 172 crore have got registered under the OTS scheme which will end on March 31, LESA officials said. The minister expressed his displeasure over power officials not establishing dialogue with consumers and motivating them to clear electricity bills on time. He asked Madhyanchal MD Surya Pal Gangwar to fix accountability of officials engaged in recovering revenue from consumers. Sharma also inspected the testing laboratory of the distribution company and expressed his annoyance over lack of proper arrangements. He asked the power officials to get a technical audit done of the laboratory.

A fresh supply of Covaxin hasn't arrived yet, officials said. State immunization officer, Dr DN Patil, said Maharashtra got 9.06 lakh doses of Covishield on Tuesday. They have already been distributed among the districts. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said Pune district received around 1.18 lakh doses. Solapur and Satara were given 35,000 and 18,000 doses respectively. Dr Deshmukh said both Covishield and Covaxin are now being used to inoculate first-time beneficiaries. A few days ago, due to a shortage of Covishield doses, first-dose beneficiaries in Pune were only being given Covaxin. “ The brand that is immediately available is being given as the first dose,” said Dr Deshmukh. He added that the new vaccine stock also will be used for the newest group in the Covid inoculation drive — those who are above the age of 45. “But the supply will also be used to administer second doses to healthcare and frontline workers who have completed the prescribed interval between Covishield doses,” he said. Hospital officials said Covishield supply has improved significantly. They said they’ll use the fresh stock to give healthcare workers their second dose, but according to the new recommended wider interval between two shots (the government this week had extended the dosage window to 4-8 weeks, from 4-6 weeks). Dr Madhur Rao, deputy medical administrator of KEM Hospital, said, “We have been told by PMC that either vaccine can be given as the first dose now, depending on availability. We have managed to get some Covishield doses, which, however, will be used for our staff. For citizens, we are using Covaxin. We still have nearly 1,000 staffers who're waiting for their second shot of Covishield. We will make them the priority.” Dr Deshmukh said registrations for above-45s will start from April 1. Beneficiaries in this group will not need to provide a comorbidities certificate while registering. Proof of age is mandatory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-gets-fresh-supply-of-over-1-lakh-covishield-doses/articleshow/81676384.cms||Neha Madaan

More than 600 women are engaged in making herbal gulal from natural flowers, leaves, fruits and barks plucked from the forests since a month. In a joint collaboration initiated by the Rajeevika Mission under supervision of the tribal development department and Udaipur zilla parishad, it is for the first time that natural colours are being manufactured at a mass scale from forest produce. The colors are being prepared at four cluster level centres each at Magwas (Jhadol), Kanore (Bhinder), Juda & Gogrud (Kotra) in the district. “We tried making herbal gulal last year, however, due to the pandemic, the production was kept low with around 20 quintals. This time we set a target of 60 quintals and already have manufactured 70 quintals and around 61 quintals have been sold in a month. The project is almost near completion,” says Narpat Singh Jaitawat, district project manager Rajeevika, Udaipur. With the district administration promoting the project on social media, the women received bulk orders from far and wide including Bhubaneshvar, Guwahati, Bengaluru, Dehradun, Chandigarh, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata.“The uniqueness of the project is that from plucking of flowers from the jungle to preparing the colours by boiling, grinding, blending the mixtures and packaging are completely handled by women. Their zeal and enthusiasm to work is commendable. Undoubtedly, it is a colour revolution taking place in the tribal belt which would go a long way in providing financial freedom to women, help them evolve as decision makers in the community,” Neha Giri, joint secretary, TAD department told TOI.The women work as self-help groups functioning under the Vandhan programme. The centres function from 10 am to 5pm where these women are busy preparing the natural extraction of flowers, bark, leaves and fruits to make non toxic, eco friendly and safe herbal colors. “They gather palash, bougainvilla, marigold flowers from temples while kanher and rajka leaves are found aplenty in this region. The flowers and leaves are boiled for three to four hours to get the pure extract which is blended with arrowroot flour and grinded well,” Jaitawat said. Presently pink, green, red, orange and yellow colours are being made. Workers are paid Rs 150 to 250 per day. Udaipur collector Chetan Ram Deora instructed government departments to participate in marketing the herbal colours for institutional and personal use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/herbal-gulal-by-udaipur-tribal-women-selling-like-hot-cakes/articleshow/81677280.cms||---

The programme was aimed at spreading awareness on the need to conserve the tree, which was once found in abundance in the region.Collector Chetan Deora, regional conservator of forests RK Jain, retired CCF Rahul Bhatnagar, wildlife activists and volunteers participated in the programme held at Dhai Mata, Kitoda in Girva block, a patch blooming with Palash flowers these days. “Like many other trees growing in forest, Palash (Butea Monosperma) is also used for fuel wood and other purposes. So we need to conserve it like many other trees. We need to create awareness about its importance to children and general public,” Bhatnagar said. Authorities stressed on the need to develop Palash groves near cities to create a bond between the tree and people, so that they can also appreciate its beauty and association with birds and animals. “Palash is part of our history and culture. It finds mention in our art, litrature and ancient texts like Puranas. Palash is known as Kimshuk, Harni, Dhak, Cheela, Khakara and Tesu. Its scientific name is Butea monosperma. It is a small tree and mostly grows up to 15 metres in dry deciduous forests. Palash leaves are arranged in bunch of three leaflets to be made into ‘donas’. The flower is fleshy and remains fresh for quite some time. Colour and shape of its flower is unique and beautiful”. Plates and other utensils are made from its leaves. The flowers are soaked in water before bath since it is an excellent moisturizer and an antidote for skin aliments of children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/beautiful-palash-flowers-paint-forest-red/articleshow/81677282.cms||---

A forum of city-based NGOs has raised the pitch for having vaccination camps in the housing societies following the recent rise in the Covid-19 cases. “The Union government manages the entire operation of setting up vaccination centres. I will request the Centre to look into the demand for vaccination camps on the housing society premises,” Pawar said, adding there would be adequate stock of vaccines in the state to ensure shots for the people aged above 45 years. The Pune District Citizens Forum Connect Group wants a medical team to be deputed for overseeing the vaccination camps in housing societies, for which SOPs can be worked out. Activist Ravindra Sinha, who represents the forum, said societies with a sizeable number of people with comorbidities should be prioritised for the programme. “Authorities should adopt innovative methods to improve the vaccination rate,” he said, adding the forum has written to CM Uddhav Thackeray, deputy CM Ajit Pawar, health minister Rajesh Tope, among others on the issue. Tope said the state was following all the guidelines issued by the Centre.

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Lockdown opened up many couples’ insecurities, personality disorders||RAJKOT: While possessiveness between partners, be it lovers or husband-wife, is considered normal but that emotional attachment too comes with its own boundaries. If the ‘clinginess’ starts to suffocate or intrude your personal space, it’s a sign of psychological problem. Such a syndrome is then labelled as ‘possessive personality disorder.’ And what better could have been than the lockdown period to discover over possessiveness — forced confinement for a long time within the four walls exposed many couples’ insecurities, reveals a survey conducted by the psychology department of Saurashtra University (SU) on 1,350 men and women during this specific period. The survey conducted by assistant professor Dimpal Ramani along with her student Krishna Kabariya in the last one year showed 85 percent of the surveyed married women over possessive, while the same sentiments were shown by 76 percent unmarried men. According to psychologists, relationship between couples is a very delicate matter and often crosses the limit. Over possessiveness invites ownership feelings which impacts relations. There is a very thin line between protecting your partner and expressing your right over your partner, they opine. “It’s good that somebody loves you. But over possessiveness or somebody expressing ownership over their partner induces bitterness in the relationship. When a person continues to think about the partner without any relaxation, such a psychology is termed as a mental disorder.” “This starts with jealousy or suspicion about a partner and thereafter a person becomes insecure and slowly it reaches to it’s extreme when a partner feels discomposure and it becomes emotional harassment,” Ramani added. Yogesh Jogsan HoD, psychology department said, “Over possessiveness is a common disorder among couples but lockdown revealed it further when couples had full access to each other’s mobile phones, WhatsApp and Facebook chats. This is a personality disorder that leaves the other partner mentally stressed. Over possessive people also try to become rough with partner’s opposite sex contacts, upset them by calling up frequently to verify his or her status etc. At this stage professional counselling is required.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/lockdown-opened-up-many-couples-insecurities-personality-disorders/articleshow/81677298.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The manifesto released by Union minister Prakash Javadekar also promises UP model legislation against Love Jihad. The manifesto seeks a public mandate to create a new Kerala by standing close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The hallmark of the manifesto, claims the document, is that it speaks only about what can be translated into action. The manifesto promises houses, drinking water facilities and electricity for all and vows to introduce minimum wages in all labour sectors. Another major promise by NDA is establishment of a politicians-free and devotee-controlled administration setup in all Hindu temples. It promises to end political murders and vows to bring in a piece of legislation for protecting Sabarimala custom and tradition. The manifesto says NDA, if voted to power, would take immediate steps to distribute five acres of agricultural land to landless SC/ST families. One of the major objectives would be to create a hunger-free Kerala. Another highlight of the manifesto is the promise of Rs.5000 assistance per month to bedridden patients in BPL families. The manifesto promises six free cooking gas cylinders to BPL families per year. Elaborating the plans for good governance, the manifesto said NDA would introduce online monitoring on government projects and expenses. In order to assess the performance of ministers and MLAs, a report card system, with the active participation of public would be introduced. A development oriented performance appraisal (DOPA) would be put in place for this purpose. The document vows to abolish pension for personal staff of ministers and cut down the government expenses by 30%. It proposes to introduce a slew of mechanisms to contain the spread of terrorism activities and promises strict action to block funding to extremist outfits. The manifesto promises to set up a special taskforce to conduct a probe into murders committed by religious fundamentalists. In the labour sector, the manifesto promises to introduce a code of conduct for trade union workers. The document says NDA, if voted to power, would put an end to the state’s over reliance on the sale of lottery and liquor for revenue earnings and proposes a ban on Islamic banks. Instead of the proposed Silver Line project, NDA proposes to take steps for laying a third railway line. It promises to restructure KIIFB and bring it under the audit of CAG.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/nda-manifesto-vows-pensionhike-legislation-on-sabarimala/articleshow/81677292.cms||---

On Tuesday, Santacruz had recorded a maximum of 35.3 degrees. Weathermen said temperature is expected to stay in this range for 48 hours. Colaba recorded a maximum of 35.4 degrees, up from 33 the previous day. The maximum recorded at Colaba and Santacruz was 3.8 and 5.3 degrees above normal. Shubhangi Bhute, scientist, IMD (Mumbai), said as per seasonal forecast, Konkan belt is likely to experience more heat waves this year. Mumbai falls under North Konkan region. “The rise is because of subsidence of hot and dry air from middle level as well as wind, which is easterly,” she said. The minimum at Colaba and Santacruz was 25.6 and 23.7 degrees respectively. In Colaba, it was 2.3 degrees above normal, while in Santacruz, it was 1.6 degrees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-boils-at-38c-to-stay-hot-for-2-days/articleshow/81676434.cms||Richa Pinto

Later, when the ACB moved to the official residence of Jain, he was found burning Rs 20 lakh cash on a gas burner in an attempt to tamper with the evidence. Acting on a complainant that Jain is seeking a Rs 5 lakh bribe for granting a contract of growing gooseberry in Pindwara to a private party, the ACB team verified the complaint and assigned Pali’s ACB team for the operation. “Singh called the complainant with Rs 1 lakh as an advance amount against Rs 5 lakh. The accused once had received the amount called up Jain informing him to have received Rs 1 lakh over the phone. There he was nabbed by the ACB team,” said BL Soni, DG (ACB). Jain sensing that the ACB team is arriving to arrest him locked his house from inside. He didn’t open the door forcing the ACB team to take the help of local police in entering his house. “When the team entered the house, he along with his wife was burning the currency. The sleuths recovered the burnt and half-burnt notes from the spot and arrested the accused,” said Soni. Another Rs 1.5 lakh was collected from Jain’s residence. Soni says that the recovery of huge cash from his residence reflects that he has been involved in corrupt practices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/two-officials-in-acb-net-over-bribery-in-sirohi-dist/articleshow/81677289.cms||---
---||Pune||No link between double-mutation variant and Maharashtra surge yet: Experts||PUNE: Nearly 15-20% of 1,600 Covid samples sent from the state for genome sequencing have been found with a variant of SARS-CoV-2 that has a double mutation. The double variant has a combination of two mutations — E484Q and L452R. The E484Q mutation has been detected in Maharashtra before and the L452R was found in patients in California, where experts believe it caused higher Covid infectivity. But the director of the National Centre for Disease Control, Dr Sujit Singh said, so far, no link has been established to say mutations alone have been responsible for Covid-19 spikes in some states. “There are various other reasons behind a surge,” he said. Experts have said virus mutations are common and since December-end, at least 771 ‘variants of concern’ (VOCs) — from 10,787 positive samples — have been identified in the country. “Genomic mutation in RNA viruses is a normal phenomenon. About 5-6% mutation is considered normal,” Dr Singh said. Health authorities said the samples sent for sequencing included those from international passengers tested at airports and from local communities. Dr Singh said of the 1,600 samples from Maharashtra, 1,149 were from the community. Of these, 206 samples reported the double mutations (E484Q+L452R). Another 118 samples with just the L452R mutation and 112 samples with only E484 were also detected. “We are correlating the results. The mere presence of mutations does not reveal much, unless they also possess characteristics that are associated with faster transmission or severe infection.” The variant with the double mutation has been categorised as a potential VOC. Experts said currently there are three VOCs in circulation — the UK, South African and Brazil variants. Some studies have linked them to higher transmission. Dr Singh said, “Only when these mutations are correlated with the existing public health scenario, can we say that new variants are a matter of concern. As of now, more evidence is needed to say, with certainty, that the surge in Maharashtra is attributable to new variants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-link-between-double-mutation-variant-and-maha-surge-yet-experts/articleshow/81676406.cms||Nisha Nambiar

It was the highest number of single-day beneficiaries the region has recorded so far.Pune rural, which saw a slump in coverage on Tuesday (4,000 jabs), recovered on Wednesday with a record 19,224 shots administered. In Pune city, around 11,686 people received their jabs and in Pimpri Chinchwad, 4,685 beneficiaries got the shot. The district on Wednesday also had the highest number of vaccination sites — at over 300. There were 158 vaccination sites in Pune rural; 100 in Pune city; 58 in Pimpri Chinchwad.But perhaps the most important development was the decision by PMC to start at least five 24x7 vaccination centres from March 24. Officials said they have decided to operate 24x7 centres at Kamala Nehru Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Hospital, Sutar Hospital, the Muralidhar Laigude Hospital and the Annasaheb Magar maternity hospital in Hadapsar.Officials said the hospitals have all been asked to keep staff ready for round-the-clock operations. They added that since the night curfew is on, only healthcare workers and frontline workers would be given the jab during the late hours.  Authorities overseeing the vaccine drive said efforts are on to add more sites.Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical) health services, Pune circle, said, “We are doing well in terms of vaccination coverage and it will improve with more sites. We had forwarded a proposal to the Union government requesting vaccination drives at over 100 civic-run hospitals with over 20 beds in Pune city. On Wednesday, we forwarded another proposal, requesting the addition of such hospitals from Pimpri Chinchwad. There are at least 32 such units there. These additions will improve pace.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/record-vax-numbers-on-wed-five-hospitals-to-start-24x7-inoculations/articleshow/81676428.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Chennai||Star constituency to see a battle royale between doctor & actor||Chennai: Thousand Lights constituency, where DMK supremo M K Stalin recorded a hat-trick, is now the venue of a doctor-versus-actor tussle. While actor-turned-politician Khushbu Sundar’s ‘Lotus’ dance to popularise her poll symbol has gone viral on social media, her opponent Dr Ezhilan is sticking to door-to-door canvassing. In terms of star value, this constituency is next only to Chepauk. Khushbu’s eleventh-hour nomination by the BJP took everybody by surprise, as the national party had only a few months ago received into its fold the DMK’s sitting MLA Ku Ka Selvam. Earlier there were rumours that Khushbu might be fielded against Udhayanidhi in Chepauk, and visuals of Khushbu’s roadshow in that constituency only added fuel to the story. Khusbu seems to be in no mood to miss out on this opportunity. Right from the day of her nomination, her rallies have attracted crowds. But the larger question is whether or not it will be converted into votes. The BJP is confident that her popularity and star value will be of great help here. Besides, they also pin hope on that the fact that the minority population at Thounsand Lights area might support Khushbu. Around 10% of the voters are Muslims. Maulana Ghulam Mohammed Mehdi Khan, Chief Qazi at the Thounsand Lights Mosque, however, said, “Though there has been no major disturbance to communal harmony here so far, we are skeptical about some of the changes proposed by parties in power now.” It is a loaded statement, indicating that it would take Khushbu much more than a dance-and-charm campaign to breach the DMK bastion. The DMK has won nine of the 15 assembly elections here and Stalin three elections between 1996 and 2006. The party’s present candidate Dr Ezhilan is the son of N Naganathan, renowned academic and former vice-chairman of the state planning commission. Ezhilan, who gained prominence through his relief work during the 2015 floods, Covid outbreak and protests against NEET and NRC, has assured the electorate that he would improve the living standard of every resident by developing housing board settlements, schools, hospitals and decongesting roads. “There is an urgent need to develop entrepreneurial skills of youngsters at Thousand Lights constituency, which has hundreds of small-scale enterprises like textile shops and printing presses,” he said. Resident welfare associations here say that MLA Ku Ka Selvam’s limited availability and absence of corporation ward councillors made their lives more difficult. For instance, Greater Chennai Corporation had proposed to construct an elevated corridor from Sterling Road junction to Nelson Manickam Road to reduce congestion on Choolaimedu’ High Road. But till date, it hasn’t materialised and there letters sent to all stakeholders went unanswered, said Kasturi Rangan from Choolaimedu Exnora.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/star-constituency-to-see-a-battle-royale-between-doctor-actor/articleshow/81676449.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Coimbatore||Some down with Covid after getting 1st vax shot||Chennai/Coimbatore: Amid the Covid surge, doctors noticed a spike in people testing positive despite having taken the vaccine. Senior infectious diseases experts in Coimbatore and Chennai said that over the past 10 days, at least 20 patients tested positive about a week to 10 days after getting their first short. Though the state does not have numbers, both government and private hospitals have reported such cases. KMCH has seen two people who took the first dose of Covishield earlier but got infected with the virus. One of them was a patient in his early 40s, who got vaccinated a fortnight back. He decided to test himself when he developed fever, cough and body pain exactly seven days later. He tested positive. “The vaccine produces antibodies only after 14 days, so the beneficiary must have caught the infection from somewhere else before his body produced anti-bodies,” the hospital’s infectious diseases expert Dr Varun Sundaramoorthy said. The second case was one of the hospital’s anaesthetists, who took the shot one month ago but got infected recently. “Both patients had only mild flu symptoms with no lung involvement. While the doctor getting infected is a cause for concern, we can assume that the one dose of vaccine mellowed down the infection,” he said. Deputy director of public health, Dr Ramesh Kumar said vaccinated people, even those with two doses, must continue to take all precautions until 15 days after the second dose. “The immunity takes 45 days to occur and even then will only make infections milder than what it could be. People must continue to take all precautions so that they don’t infect others who are not yet immune.” “Fewer people tested positive after the second dose. Among them the infection is mild,” Apollo Hospitals infectious diseases expert Dr V Ramasubramanian said. “On the other hand, some patients who have taken one dose come in with high fever, cough, cold and other complications.” Doctors said people testing positive after their first shot is mainly because they let down their guard, stop wearing masks and violate distancing norms. “Most vaccine centres in Chennai do not maintain social distancing norms or insist people wear masks while they wait inside the observation rooms for thirty minutes. It is even worse in buses, trains, religious places, malls and beaches,” Gleneagles Global Hospitals infectious diseases expert Dr Subramanian Swaminathan said. His hospital has seen about 15 such cases in the last few days, including some under treatment in the intensive care unit. This may not have happened if vaccines were available when the rate of transmission was lower between January and February, senior virologist Dr Jacob John said. “This is the reflection of the speed of transmission of the virus. The infection rate for UK strain is two times higher than the mother virus,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/some-down-with-covid-after-getting-1st-vax-shot/articleshow/81677299.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Besides, 42 patients succumbed to the infection in the region in the last 24 hours, highest since mid-October last year, taking its toll to 9,682. The Pune municipal areas added 3,509 cases on Wednesday, followed by the Pimpri Chinchwad areas (1,865) and the rural and cantonment pockets (1,367). With this, the region’s total positive caseload has reached above 4.86 lakh. As for tests, the PMC areas checked around 16,185 samples, while the PCMC and rural areas tested over 4,100 samples each. The sample testing in the region surged beyond 27 lakh on Wednesday, of which over 13.66 lakh samples have been tested in the PMC limits. The daily cases and tests have been on rise for the last few days in the region. Both municipal corporations have ramped up swab collections, following case rise. The daily recoveries continued to stay above 3,000 in the region on Wednesday. A report released by the district health officer, Bhagwan Pawar, stated that as many as 3,221 patients were discharged in the region in the last 24 hours, of whom 1,410 patients were declared cured in the PMC limits, 987 in the rural areas and 824 in the Pimpri Chinchwad areas.

---||Pune||Private pathology labs under lens amid high positivity rate||PUNE: Private pathology laboratories have come under the scanner of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) amid high rate of positive results, prompting civic officials to cross-verify their testing methods. Nearly 11,000 tests are being conducted at private labs every day, compared to 3,000 at civic and government-run facilities. PMC data showed that positivity rate of government-run labs was around 25% against private laboratories’ 40%. A total of 26 major testing centres are operating in the civic areas, including 24 private labs. Two test centres operated by the government include National Institute of Virology (NIV) and the Sassoon hospital. These facilities are doing RT-PCR tests. “We had invited all the leading labs in the city for a meeting. The data about the types of tests they are conducting was taken from them. Information about their testing kits was also checked. Cross-verification of standards used for tests and SOP was also done,” said Sanjeev Wavare, a senior official of the PMC’s health department. The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation on Tuesday barred private hospitals from conducting Covid-19 tests following complaints about high positivity rate. When asked if PMC was going to take action on the same lines, Wavare said banning private labs was not an option. “But case-specific action can be taken after checking facts. The demand for per day tests is very high. Handling the load only with the help of government-run labs will not be possible,” Wavare said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pvt-pathology-labs-under-lens-amid-high-positivity-rate/articleshow/81676432.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

---||Mumbai||Give 3-day notice to Arnab Goswami before TRP case summons: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday allowed Mumbai police to continue the probe against Republic TV and its editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami in the TRP (television ratings point) rigging case but granted Goswami interim protection from summons/arrest without a 72-hour notice. The HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale gave these directions while admitting a plea by Goswami and ARG Outlier Media that runs all Republic channels seeking quashing of the case or transferring it to CBI, and posted it for hearing on June 28. Public prosecutor Deepak Thakre said it will complete the probe in 12 weeks. The HC accepted his statement and directed that the investigating officer should give a “clear notice of three days (excluding holidays)” in case he wants to summon Goswami. If Goswami receives such summons, “he shall appear and co-operate with the inquiry before the IO” as assured by his counsel Harish Salve last October, the HC added. The police are probing an FIR registered on October 6, 2020, about meters being rigged to induce viewers to watch particular channels. Seeking interim protection for Goswami, senior counsel Ashok Mundargi had argued mala fide intentions of the state and pointed out that despite a magistrate having closed the abetment of suicide case, the Alibag-Raigad police had arrested Goswami last year and he was released only after the Supreme Court granted him bail. During the TRP investigation “if IO has reasons to believe that he needs to take coercive action against (Goswami), he shall give clear notice of 72 hours before taking such coercive action’’ to allow him to “approach competent forum for appropriate relief”, said the HC. The interim order is granted keeping in mind the “peculiar facts and circumstances of this case”, keeping in view the “serious mala fide” alleged by them against the state and in view of Goswami’s arrest in the Anvay Naik abetment of suicide case. Mundargi also argued that under the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) there was “no concept of ‘suspect’ and that investigation and proceedings can be undertaken only against accused persons”. The court said the petition deserves to be admitted for five legal questions it raises, including whether the HC can entertain a quashing plea on the grounds of ‘serious mala fide’ and grant any interim protection if the petitioners have not been named as ‘accused’ in the FIR, and if the police can continue the probe by naming ‘owners/managers of Republic TV and persons associated’ with it as ‘suspects’ in its chargesheet. The HC said the police cannot invoke the chargesheet clause regarding ‘suspects’ to take coercive action against Goswami. Mundargi also argued that despite two chargesheets filed, there was “no material found yet against Goswami or ARG Outlier”. He submitted that the purpose of putting a ‘suspects’ clause was only to “continue to harass the petitioners with such open ended investigation, which does not seem to be culminating”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/give-3-day-notice-to-goswami-before-trp-case-summons-bombay-hc/articleshow/81676455.cms||Swati Deshpande

SI Prashant Yadav (35) was hit in the neck and died within minutes. State’s chief minister Yogi Adityanath expressed condolences to the family of Yadav and announced Rs 50lakh in compensation to the bereaved family as well as a government job to a dependent. Yogi also announced that a road will be named after the ‘shaheed’ sub-inspector. This comes a month after a constable, Devendra Singh, was stripped, dragged into a field and beaten to death in neighbouring Kasganj district allegedly by a criminal whose illicit liquor brewing business ran in the region for over seven years. A sub-inspector, Ashok Pal, was also injured in the attack which took place on February 9. On November 8, last year, police constable Sonu Kumar Chaudhary was run over in Agra district by a tractor-trolley allegedly owned by members of the local mining mafia. Recruited in 2006, SI Yadav is from Bulandshahr’s Chattari village. He is survived by his wife and two children. “His family has been informed about the death. They are on their way to Agra,” said Babloo Kumar, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Agra. The incident took place when SI Yadav and constable Chandrasen had gone to Nehra village after getting information about a clash between two brothers. According to police, Shivnath and Vishvanath, were involved in a dispute over harvesting of potatoes in their field, which is equally divided among them and their father Vijay Singh Pehalwan. Both brothers live separately. Shivnath lives with his father while Vishvanath with mother. Shivnath had sowed potatoes in his father’s field. But, at the time of harvesting, his younger brother raised objections and demanded half of the harvest. This led to a clash. On Wednesday evening, Vishvanath took out a country-made weapon and threatened labourers who were involved in harvesting. When SI Yadav reached there, Vishvanath tried to run. During the chase, Vishvanath allegedly opened fire and a bullet hit the SI in the neck. He was taken to a hospital but could not survive. ADG (Agra zone) Rajeev Krishna and SSP Kumar rushed to the spot after getting information. Talking to TOI ADG Krishna said the accused will be arrested soon. Police didn’t know if Vishvanath had a past criminal history. They said it will come out soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/sub-inspector-shot-dead-in-agra/articleshow/81675622.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The KCB has over 220 Covid-positive cases till date.KCB chief executive officer Pramod Kumar Singh told TOI, “We continue to take action against commercial establishments to maintain Covid-19 norms in the bazaar and other localities in Khadki.”The cantonment board restarted the 60-bed capacity Covid Care Centre at its sports complex on Tuesday. “The paucity of fund will be a major concern for us as monthly expenses of the Covid Centre would be close to Rs 10 lakh. The cantonment’s revenue generation has dried up due to the pandemic. We would need financial assistance from the district administration to run the facility,” Singh added.KCB is also in the process of starting a six-bed intensive care unit (ICU) at its Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar general hospital. “We need ICU beds to treat critical Covid-19 cases,” Singh added.The board is reporting cases from across areas, unlike earlier. “Last year, we had cases mainly from densely populated areas but this time cases are being reported from all localities. So, we are unable to create containment zones,” Singh added.ZP to hire 250 medical staffers Zilla Parishad (ZP) plans to hire 250 medical staffers, including doctors, for the 500-bed Wipro Covid-19 hospital at Hinjewadi. ZP chief executive officer Ayush Prasad said, “They would be hired on contract for three months. If required, we may extend their contract. Some of the staff members have already joined the facility.

Mumbai mirrored the trend with an unprecedented daily tally of 5,190, albeit against a record 40,400 tests. Nine out of the 10 districts with the highest caseloads in the country are currently from Maharashtra (Bengaluru Urban is the only non-Maharashtra district). The Maharashtra government’s Covid-19 task force has now called for stringent checks on movement in Mumbai, including shutting down popular spots like Juhu beach for a few weeks, restrictions on post-7pm trips within the city, and early closure of commercial establishments in the non-essential sector. Task force member Dr Niteen Karnik, head of medicine at Sion Hospital, recommended that Mumbai should, like Nagpur, opt for a “restricted lockdown’’ for two weeks. District administration in Beed was the latest to announce a 10-day restriction on business and services from Thursday onwards. Reflecting all-round concern over growing numbers, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray told his cabinet on Wednesday about the need to boost vaccination and strictly implement Covid-19 appropriate restrictions. "Maharashtra has been strictly following the guidelines issued by the Centre and has been transparent about the data. There are some states that have elections and some others who are hosting events with huge crowds there. How is that cases are not increasing in those states?" said Thackeray during the cabinet meeting. A presentation made by the state health department for Wednesday’s cabinet meeting underlined the burning issues: active cases have ballooned since February 11 in 35 districts, with Sindhudurg the only exception; doubling rate of cases has fallen to 63 days from 194 days on February 28; and recovery has slipped to 88.7% from 94% in the same period. Cases in Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai, Thane and Nashik contribute for 61% of the state’s active cases. The Mumbai administrative block comprising Mumbai, Thane and smaller corporations nearby, accounted for nearly a third (9,147) of Wednesday’s tally of 31,855. In Mumbai, the picture is getting bleaker as demand for hospital beds rises. Dr Prince Surana of Surana Hospital, Chembur, said enquiries have risen sharply. ``We have 160 beds between two of our hospitals and they are full,’’ he said. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said as most patients these days are from “highrises’’, private health facilities are more sought after. ``We have about 2,900 private sector beds and these will be shortly be upgraded to 5,000,’’ he said. Around 41% of the 13,083 beds in the public and private sector are still vacant in Mumbai, he added. ``More tests will result in more positive cases,’’ he said. Dharavi, which has emerged as the barometer of Covid in Mumbai, reported 62 cases--the highest in the areas since May 2020. In the Kalyan-Dombivli belt, 881 cases were detected—highest in a 24-hour period. Ditto with Thane where 793 cases were registered. Navi Mumbai reported 519 cases, while Panvel 283 cases.

The accused Harish Kami, a native of Nepal, returned home on Monday night and strangulated his son Dinesh in a fit of rage. Police said he allegedly committed the heinous crime in front of his five-year-old daughter.  After killing Dinesh, Kami tried to pass it off as a natural death and called his relatives and neighbours. He even buried him as per rituals.  However, Kami's daughter revealed the truth to her mother who immediately contacted the man's brother Naresh. Naresh then approached the police and the boy's body was exhumed and sent for postmortem to Jamnagar Civil Hospital on Tuesday evening.  Kami was working as a cook in a private canteen in the day time and as a security guard at a construction site during the night.  "Naresh Singh told us that he was fed up the medical expenses of his son who had polio for the last four years. Despite doing two jobs, he was unable to afford medicines," said investigating officer BG Bhatt, Mundra police station.  Kami came to Mundra four years ago and was living with his family. “Kami has been detained. After getting the postmortem report, we will lodge the official complaint,” said Bhatt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/unable-to-afford-treatment-man-kills-polio-affected-son/articleshow/81676647.cms||---

He hiked the monthly assistance to widows from Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500 and made a provision of Rs 2.5 crore for a new scheme, ‘Mukhyamantri Devdarshan Scheme’ for senior citizens using Indian Railways to visit pilgrimages sites. The chief minister also sought to enable the economically weaker sections to avail benefits of social welfare schemes. He proposed to revive the ‘Goencho Dayaz’ scheme with “modifications” and made a provision of Rs 5 crore to support people involved in traditional occupations such as the padeli (coconut plucker), vodekar (boatman), chari (artisan), kumbhar (potter), kansar (coppersmith), mitkar (salt extractor), mhalo (barber), cobbler, murtikar (sculptor), pilots and madvall (laundryman). Sawant’s budget speech also had something in it for persons with disability where he proposed to provide “doorstep consultation and therapy for digyangs by starting a divyang rath”, besides providing various aids and assistive devices. He also made empty assurances that government buildings would be made accessible under the central government’s Accessible India Campaign, a task that has been pending for several years. He even proposed to support certain NGOs in the social welfare sector through grants to “boost their morale”. “I propose to upgrade the infrastructure of Provedoria as most of the premises are in bad shape,” he said. Sawant assured that his government would continue to provide scholarships to SC, OBC, and economically backward students with central government assistance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-showers-sops-on-widows-sr-citizens-traditional-workers/articleshow/81678157.cms||---

Sources informed that goods worth lakhs were gutted in the fire which raged on for more than four hours. According to the fire department, the fire broke out at around 4.30 am on Wednesday at Shreeji Agarbatti Works. By the time firemen reached the spot, flames had engulfed a large part of the manufacturing building due to which a ‘major call’ was announced by the department and fire vehicles were dispatched from all fire stations in the city. No injuries were reported in the incident as those present in the building had rushed out just in time and informed Vadodara Fire and Emergency Services. As many as 17 fire vehicles and 35 firemen were deployed to douse the fire. “Initially, we faced difficulty in rescue operation as there was just one door to enter the building. So, we used the hydraulic platform to sprinkle water from the top,” said fire officer Nikunj Azad of Makarpura GIDC fire station. He added the blaze spread quickly due to the presence of chemicals stored at the ground floor of the building. It took over four hours to douse the flames, but cooling operations continued even after that. Fire officials said that the building got heated so much due to the fire that they had to continue to sprinkle water until around 2 pm. The reason for the cause of the fire is still being investigated. Fire department sources said that the unit owner suffered losses running into lakhs in the mishap. Several women working at the unit gathered outside when the fire fighting operations were on. Many of them started crying on seeing the condition of their workplace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/massive-fire-breaks-out-at-incense-sticks-factory/articleshow/81676288.cms||---

The KCB has over 220 Covid-positive cases till date.KCB chief executive officer Pramod Kumar Singh told TOI, “We continue to take action against commercial establishments to maintain Covid-19 norms in the bazaar and other localities in Khadki.”The cantonment board restarted the 60-bed capacity Covid Care Centre at its sports complex on Tuesday. “The paucity of fund will be a major concern for us as monthly expenses of the Covid Centre would be close to Rs 10 lakh. The cantonment’s revenue generation has dried up due to the pandemic. We would need financial assistance from the district administration to run the facility,” Singh added.KCB is also in the process of starting a six-bed intensive care unit (ICU) at its Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar general hospital. “We need ICU beds to treat critical Covid-19 cases,” Singh added.The board is reporting cases from across areas, unlike earlier. “Last year, we had cases mainly from densely populated areas but this time cases are being reported from all localities. So, we are unable to create containment zones,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/kcb-acts-against-shops-for-violating-ncov-related-norms/articleshow/81676447.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Thane||Daily cases top 31,000 in Maharashtra, 5,000 in Mumbai; task force calls for curbs||MUMBAI: The second wave of Covid-19 in Maharashtra resulted in the highest-ever number of cases in a single day—31,855—on Wednesday. Mumbai mirrored the trend with an unprecedented daily tally of 5,190, albeit against a record 40,400 tests. Nine out of the 10 districts with the highest caseloads in the country are currently from Maharashtra (Bengaluru Urban is the only non-Maharashtra district). The Maharashtra government’s Covid-19 task force has now called for stringent checks on movement in Mumbai, including shutting down popular spots like Juhu beach for a few weeks, restrictions on post-7pm trips within the city, and early closure of commercial establishments in the non-essential sector. Task force member Dr Niteen Karnik, head of medicine at Sion Hospital, recommended that Mumbai should, like Nagpur, opt for a “restricted lockdown’’ for two weeks. District administration in Beed was the latest to announce a 10-day restriction on business and services from Thursday onwards. Reflecting all-round concern over growing numbers, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray told his cabinet on Wednesday about the need to boost vaccination and strictly implement Covid-19 appropriate restrictions. "Maharashtra has been strictly following the guidelines issued by the Centre and has been transparent about the data. There are some states that have elections and some others who are hosting events with huge crowds there. How is that cases are not increasing in those states?" said Thackeray during the cabinet meeting. A presentation made by the state health department for Wednesday’s cabinet meeting underlined the burning issues: active cases have ballooned since February 11 in 35 districts, with Sindhudurg the only exception; doubling rate of cases has fallen to 63 days from 194 days on February 28; and recovery has slipped to 88.7% from 94% in the same period. Cases in Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai, Thane and Nashik contribute for 61% of the state’s active cases. The Mumbai administrative block comprising Mumbai, Thane and smaller corporations nearby, accounted for nearly a third (9,147) of Wednesday’s tally of 31,855. In Mumbai, the picture is getting bleaker as demand for hospital beds rises. Dr Prince Surana of Surana Hospital, Chembur, said enquiries have risen sharply. ``We have 160 beds between two of our hospitals and they are full,’’ he said. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said as most patients these days are from “highrises’’, private health facilities are more sought after. ``We have about 2,900 private sector beds and these will be shortly be upgraded to 5,000,’’ he said. Around 41% of the 13,083 beds in the public and private sector are still vacant in Mumbai, he added. ``More tests will result in more positive cases,’’ he said. Dharavi, which has emerged as the barometer of Covid in Mumbai, reported 62 cases--the highest in the areas since May 2020. In the Kalyan-Dombivli belt, 881 cases were detected—highest in a 24-hour period. Ditto with Thane where 793 cases were registered. Navi Mumbai reported 519 cases, while Panvel 283 cases.

---||Chennai||Int’l body plans spl pass to make travel abroad hassle-free||Chennai: Soon, travellers need not have to constantly check up on Covid rules on a variety of websites for different destinations abroad ahead of their journey. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) and airlines are trying out a special travel pass that can be used when scheduled flights resume. Passengers can access rules of the destination country and also upload all their health details, including Covid-19 test reports and vaccine certificates, before their online check-in so airlines and immigration officials will have easy access to their information. This pass is expected to be the norm. “The initiative is useful as passenger health credentials can be at a single point that can be accessed by airlines and immigration officials. Now, the scrutiny of documents is taking time,” an airline official said. Airlines in India are yet to sign up and IATA is in talks with authorities and airlines to implement the system. “We are in talks with Indian authorities and airlines for Travel Pass to be used in India,” confirmed Vinoop Goel, regional director, airports and external relations, Asia Pacific. Seventeen airlines, including Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways, Thai Airways, Malaysia Airlines, have signed up to try out the IATA travel pass. These airlines fly via transit hubs used by travellers from Chennai to fly to Europe and the Far East. Singapore Airlines has begun using the pass on its London-Singapore route. British Airways is trying out its own system, by which passengers upload their Covid test results on it site, on its route to Chennai and other cities. Online check-in is allowed only after the airline authenticates the documents. Basheer Ahmed of Travel Agents Federation of India said this is likely to gradually turn into a travel passport. “As many countries are demanding such uploads, IATA is trying to regularise it and make it easier for travellers to fly multiple countries without a hassle,” he said. The loophole in the current system allows passengers coming from the US or UK to dodge tests in Delhi or Mumbai and fly domestic to Chennai. It is difficult for airlines to track travel history of a passenger. At present, staff check passports at transit hubs like London and Dubai. There have been instances of people breaking journey at a foreign transit airport and flying to Chennai to skip tight scrutiny. The pass may prevent such violations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/intl-body-plans-spl-pass-to-make-travel-abroad-hassle-free/articleshow/81676459.cms||V Ayyappan

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), along with the district administration, on Wednesday issued orders banning public celebrations of Holi and Rang Panchami. Officials stated that the decision was taken to curb any further spread of the coronavirus cases across the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). “The directives were issued in accordance with relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897,” PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said. The order stated that public gatherings should be avoided due to pandemic. Celebrations of Holi on March 28 and Rang Panchami on March 29 should not be carried out at hotels, resorts, community halls, roads, grounds, gardens and schools. “People should also avoid celebration even at the personal level as part of the state government’s ‘Me Jababdar’ drive,” the PMC order stated. The PCMC’s order was on the same lines of the PMC and the district administration’s directives. The ban will be effective in all areas under the PCMC’s jurisdiction. “Zonal, enforcement and flying squads will a keep tab on the Covid-19 guidelines and its violation,” PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil said. As per the orders, 24 squads will operate across the PCMC areas. “There will be eight flying squads, eight enforcement squads and eight ward officers’ squads,” stated the order that became effective from Wednesday and would be in place till the next directive. The order stated that the squads would also monitor the violations pertaining to Covid-19 norms.

The woman was discharged from hospital on Tuesday night, but her son and daughter-in-law locked their house in Narhe and went out. Despite repeated calls from the elderly woman and the policemen, the son did not come to unlock the house. “The doctors informed the man that his mother would be discharged on Tuesday. However, he did not go to to pick her up. The hospital contacted us and sought help,” senior inspector Devidas Gheware of Sinhagad Road police said. “A police team took the woman to her flat and called up the son. After repeated calls, he informed that he was in the Sassoon hospital as his father-in-law had passed away there,” he said. “On Wednesday, the couple refused to open the house. We realised the couple was afraid of contracting the virus from the woman,” Gheware said, adding that the couple were counselled, after which they agreed to take the woman back home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-refuses-to-let-mother-enter-home-after-isolation/articleshow/81676462.cms||---
---||India||Param Bir allegations serious, but he should go to HC: SC||NEW DELHI: While observing that allegations levelled by former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh are quite serious, the Supreme Court asked Singh to approach the Bombay HC in pursuance of his plea for a fair and impartial probe. Referring to the allegations levelled by the cop and the minister against each other, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and R Subhash Reddy said it seems that parties in the case were “hunky-dory” for a long time but they started making allegations and counter-allegations as a consequence of their falling out. Singh has accused Deshmukh of asking disgraced “encounter” copy Sachin Waze, currently in NIA custody, to raise Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai. “We’ve no doubt that the matter is quite serious and affects the administration at large. It also appears that a lot of material which has come in public domain is a consequence of the personas falling out,” the court said. It asked senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi why his client SC directly and suggested that Singh knock at the doors of Bombay HC. The court also pointed out that the minister against whom allegations had been levelled was not made a party. Rohatgi said it was a mistake and that he is willing to forthwith implead Deshmukh as respondent. “If probe by an independent agency is being sought for, that is a relief which can also be granted by the high court. There have also been subsequent developments in the matter as has been noticed in terms of the report of Rashmi Shukla, commissioner, state intelligence department. The HC has the requisite authority to address the same,” it said. Rohatgi agreed to withdraw the petition and told the court that he will file it in HC on Wednesday itself. As the petitioner referred to SC verdict on police reforms to impress upon the court to intervene to protect him, the bench expressed concern that its verdict had not been followed by states and the issue always cropped up when a controversy, like the present one, erupted in public glare. “In our view, this is only a mantra recited periodically, wherever the occasion so suits, and there has been no seriousness by all concerned to ever implement the directions enshrined in the judgment. These directions were based on the principle of insulating police machinery from political/executive interference to make it more efficient and to strengthen the rule of law. It appears that none want to give up, inter alia, the control of police transfers or implement measures that would insulate the police machinery from performing its role without any uncalled for interference,” the bench added. Singh, a 1988 batch IPS officer, sought a comprehensive CBI probe into Deshmukh’s acts of alleged corruption and criminality. He also claimed that he was transferred out immediately after he briefed CM Uddhav Thackeray about the minister’s alleged activities. Singh challenged Deshmukh on his statement to that he was transferred to facilitate a fair probe into the explosive-laden vehicle found near Mukesh Ambani’s residence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/param-bir-allegations-serious-but-he-should-go-to-hc-sc/articleshow/81679611.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

DJs are usually hired to perform for various parties during Holi. However, the lockdown last year meant they could not perform anywhere. With fresh restrictions in force this year as well due to a spurt in Covid-19 cases, they are travelling out of the state to pocket some earnings. DJ duo Noise Faktory, comprising Vicky Hundani and Sukhvinder Gujral, are heading to Goa to perform for Holi. “It is a safer bet to perform in other cities, where the situation is relatively stable,” said Gujral. Abhinav Girdhar, aka DJ Faith, is headed to Raipur to perform for a Holi event. He claims DJs have better opportunities in cities such as Kolkata, Goa, Delhi, Chennai. “The club culture in Pune has been so badly affected that many DJs have been completely out of work for over a year. Though there are better opportunities out of the state, they are far and few.” DJ A-Yo, aka Akshay Yeole, who will be performing in Goa, said, “Two of my friends, who are also DJs shifted to Bengaluru for better prospects. The pay is also better in other states, such as Goa, because the venue owners are not insecure about another lockdown happening or permissions being revoked by the government.” Anil Chainani, aka DJ Lemon, said, “Established DJs are getting gigs in other metros but those just starting their careers are not even getting to play in Pune. The restrictions at night are damaging to our community, which is anyway struggling to survive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/djs-look-out-of-state-to-cash-in-on-colour-fest-revelry/articleshow/81676483.cms||---

Talking to reporters in Kannur on Wednesday, Chennithala demanded that all bogus voters should be removed from the electoral rolls and urged the election commission to take steps to prevent such fake voters from casting votes. Scrutiny by Opposition has revealed that there were 1,09,693 people who had votes in other constituencies apart from their original place of residence, he said and citing the case of Irikkur in Kannur, he added that there were 537 such bogus voters in Irikkur alone. It included 242 people from Thalipparamba, 127 from Payyannur, 91 from Kalliyassery, 47 from Azhikode and 30 from Kannur constituencies. He said it has been found that all the double voters were given voter ID cards by the election commission in multiple constituencies as well. With this the total number of bogus voters in the voters’ list in the state has crossed more than 4.25 lakh. “We suspect that Left-affiliated officials have deliberately included such double voters to help the front. There is a conspiracy behind this and it is being done by the ruling front to scuttle the mandate of the people of Kerala. CPM is suspected to have played a serious role in this as the party had been regularly engaged in including double voters in the electoral rolls and providing those facilities to remove indelible ink and making them vote again,” he added. Later when asked during a media interaction in Kozhikode whether UDF would take the stand that it doesn’t need BJP votes in Thalassery and Guruvayur constituencies, Chennithala countered by asking if CPM has taken such a stand. “No party would say they don’t need votes in an election. There are many people without any political affiliations and they would vote as per their wish,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/chennithala-left-leaning-officials-added-bogus-voters-in-list/articleshow/81677311.cms||---

After registering an FIR, police in Etah launched the operation to arrest the three accused policemen including Kotwali Dehat station house officer (SHO) Indreshpal Singh, constables Santosh Kumar and Shailendra Kumar. All the three are under suspension and missing. They have been booked under IPC section 384 (punishment for extortion), 211 (false charge of offence made with intent to injure), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) and section 7/13 of the prevention of corruption act. Additional director general of police (ADG) of Agra zone, Rajeev Krishna, had ordered a probe.The eatery owner, Praveen Kumar Yadav, had alleged that on March 4, the two constables had refused to pay Rs 400 bill after eating food. “They were offering only Rs 80. My elder brother requested them to pay at least Rs 200. Some of the customers also asked them to pay the bill. Following an argument, the policemen started beating my brother. They were drunk and threatened to send us to jail.” Yadav said that after the argument, constables left the eatery at Agra Road. “Soon, 15 policemen arrived and took my brother and cousin along with eight costumers to Kotwali Dehat police station and registered an FIR against them.”In the FIR, they alleged that the 10 people were part of an organized gang and were hatching a plan for loot. Police also claimed that they were held following an encounter. They also showed country-made pistols and liquor in recovery.After initial investigation conducted by ASP Kumar, it came out that SHO Singh had shown fake recovery in connivance with liquor mafia Bantu Yadav. However, he was not named in the FIR. According to sources, Bantu was booked under the Gangster Act by Etah police in 2017. He has several other criminal cases pending against him. IG Piyush Mordia said, “Role of Bantu is under investigation. His name will also be added to FIR. No one involved in the entire matter will not be spared”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-cops-who-framed-10-people-after-an-argument-over-payment-of-bill-go-missing-search-on/articleshow/81675633.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Mumbai||Zero-tolerance policy a must to break cop-criminal nexus: Anami Roy||MUMBAI: Nearly a fortnight after the arrest of controversial encounter specialist Sachin Waze for his alleged involvement in placing of an explosives-laden vehicle near the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani, former Mumbai police commissioner Anami Roy on Wednesday said it was high time the state government brought in a zero tolerance policy for officers with any kind of nexus with the underworld or organised crime syndicates. “When I led Mumbai police, a cozy conversation was brought to my notice. It was between a senior police inspector and a member of the Dawood Ibrahim family, which was booked under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act. I dismissed him the same night using powers under Article 311-2 of the Constitution of India in 2005. He could never return to service. Subsequently, as a DGP (director general of police), I also dismissed senior inspector Pradeep Sharma, invoking the same provisions. All actions were taken notwithstanding great opposition from all quarters. In fact, it was questioned in the media too, but I held steadfast with my actions and decisions,” Roy told TOI. An IPS officer of the 1972 batch, Roy was Mumbai police commissioner from 2004 to 2007 and retired in May 2010 as the DGP. As Mumbai CP, Roy cut to size all self-styled encounter specialists. It was Roy’s opinion that most encounter specialists were projected as larger than life and they illegally used powers at their disposal. “I found that many crime branch officials had installed privately acquired gadgets with or without the knowledge of their seniors. These were ostensibly for collecting information on criminals and organised crime syndicates. But obviously this was against the prevailing rules. As a Mumbai CP, I ensured that all such units were dismantled. All operations are to be carried out under the guidance of senior officials,” Roy said. He said rampant and unauthorised holding and use of automatic weapons was also a serious issue; it was completely checked and brought in line with permissible rules. Roy took over the reins of the Mumbai police in 2004 in the backdrop of the infamous Telgi scam and Khwaja Yunus custodial death case, followed by the arrest of several high profile police officials. “Then, the image of Mumbai police was at a low ebb. The scenario regarding encounters and encounter specialists was very smoky and shady. These specialists had acquired a larger-than-life image and were not operating within the legal framework. We took drastic measures to clean up the system and stem the rot that had set in,” Roy said. When Roy found that several officers were camping in the elite crime branch for a prolonged period, some for more than a decade and monopolised the unit, he drafted a new policy in consultation with all joint police commissioners. “We fixed the tenure of officers so that all get a level playing field and rotation of jobs. Certain officers who were in the unit for a long period were indulging in malpractices. We brought in a new policy for posting from the police station to the crime branch and from the crime branch to the police station, mainly to end the monopoly,” Roy added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-zero-tolerance-policy-a-must-to-break-cop-criminal-nexus-an-roy/articleshow/81677320.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Speaking to reporters, Kamat likened the budget to an empty vessel, more noise than anything else. “These are just paper announcements. There is no action taken report placed before the House as far as the last announcement is concerned,” he said. Kamat also said that while Sawant has not said where the money to meet all the announcements will come from. He has made the promises because of the upcoming elections, he said, adding that some of the schemes are old one that are repeated every year. “The administrative building and the Tuem Electronic City were announced in the 2017 budget, too,” Kamat said. Hotmixing, too, he said the CM had announced last year and has been reannounced now within a gap of four months. “We are completing March and after April we cannot do hot mixing in Goa because of the monsoon. I don’t know if he wants to do hot mixing during the monsoon,” he said. Most of the budget is about central government schemes. “There are no innovative schemes that can help the marginalised sector, which has become weak having suffered due to Covid.” Reacting to the mining corporation, Kamat said that if the government wanted to set up one up, then why did they wait for so long. “They have to see whether they can form a mining corporation. You just cannot say anything. You have to see the legal implication,” Kamat said. On the Mhadei issue, he said that Sawant had said that they would protect the river, but now the matter is no longer in the state’s hands. “The government has not said what steps they will take,” he said. These are just paper announcements. There is no ‘action taken’ report placed before the House as far as the last announcement is concerned||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/budget-lacks-innovation-will-hit-marginalised-says-kamat/articleshow/81678174.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Tourism industry gives thumbs up to Budget, rising bookings cancellations a worry||Jaipur: Leading travel and tourism industry associations in the state on Wednesday thanked the government for making various provisions in the Budget 2021-22 to support the sector even as the second wave of corona virus is threatening to peg back the recent recovery with cancellations of bookings pouring in.“The Budget provisions for tourism sector is a milestone decision in the history of the tourism industry. In the 70 years of India’s Independence, it is for the first time that such a huge Budget (Rs 500 crore) has been announced for the state. Relaxation has also been given in the bar license fee and ease of availing a new bar license is a great relief for the industry,” said Kuldeep Singh Chandela, president of both Hotel, Restaurant Association of Rajasthan (HRAR) and Rajasthan Association of Tour Operators (RATO).He said that the recently announced curfew norms as a part of the Covid guidelines will soften the blow the on the restaurant industry.But they also they also made an appeal to the government to give the industry benefits on electricity, water and UDH tax. “While the government has supported the industry, they should also go the extra way to give the hospitality sector the industry benefits,” said Randhir Vikram Singh, Indian Heritage Hotels Association (IHHA).But many hoteliers said that the industry is not out of woods and there are tough times ahead because of the second wave of corona virus. Rajendra Singh Pachar, member, executive committee of IHHA, said, “The industry in Udaipur made a smart recovery after lockdown. But now, like the faster recovery, the decline has been also equally sharper because of the requirement of negative RT-PCR report for people entering the district. Now, the impact of the restriction is everywhere in the state.” But the representatives of the industry bodies said that they cannot blame the government because the wellbeing of the society comes first and business next. Ran Vijay Singh, joint secretary, HRAR, said, “The hotel industry has received 70-80% cancellations because of the mandatory RT-PCR report guidelines. Instead of a blanket decision, the government can look at the hotspot states and make it mandatory for travelers from those states to carry negative RT-PCR report.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tourism-industry-gives-thumbs-up-to-budget-rising-bookings-cancellations-a-worry/articleshow/81676491.cms||---
---||Jaipur||RERC relents, net metering benefits to stay till June 30 till further decision||Jaipur: Buckling under pressure from industry and in view of a possible revision in net metering for load up to 10 kilo watt and gross metering above 10 kilo watt by the Union ministry of power and Central Electricity Authority, the Rajasthan Energy Regulatory Commission (RERC) has deferred implementation of new rooftop solar net metering norms that threatened to affect 90% of the projects.In an order on Wednesday, RERC said that while the commission proposed to issue finalized regulations in due course of time, it said that to bring regulatory certainty it is clarified that ‘Rooftop and Small Solar Grid Interactive Systems’ commissioned under net metering agreements up to June 30, 2021, will continue to avail the net metering benefits.The commission had issued draft regulations on December 21, 2020, and said that “these regulations shall be applicable to all grid interactive distributed renewable energy generating systems that are commissioned on or after April 1, 2021”.In February this year, the Union ministry of new and renewable energy had also written to RERC saying it has received a number of representations to review the provision as this will adversely impact in achieving the targets set for rooftop solar industry in the country. “The MNRE has requested the MoP to review the provision related to net metering and MoP is likely to come up with a revised provision,” it had said in the letter to the RERC.Under net metering, the consumer uses the cheaper rooftop solar power instead of the costly discom power. Under the gross billing or metering, as per the draft proposals, the project owner will have to pay normal electricity rate to discoms even though it uses cheap power from its rooftop plant. The discoms will pay the gross meter to the project owner for the solar rooftop energy generation at rates discovered through auction along with 25% incentive which would be far lower than the discom rates of around Rs 8 per unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rerc-relents-net-metering-benefits-to-stay-till-june-30-till-further-decision/articleshow/81676489.cms||---

Roofs of many temporary houses in Pak-displaced colonies in Jaisalmer city were blown away, while two jawans of 139th BSF battalion deployed at the Indo-Pak border in Tanot area were injured when tin sheds flew and hit them. There is also information of deaths of cattle in many areas. It is estimated that crops on 1 lakh hectare land in Barmer have been damaged. Looking at the seriousness of the case, chief minister Ashok Gehlot has sent revenue minister Harish Choudhary to Jaisalmer, who will inspect the affected areas. Cabinet minister and Pokhran MLA Saleh Mohammad on Wednesday visited affected areas in Nachana area in the district and took information from the farmers about the damages. Jaisalmer district BJP president, writing a letter to Gehlot, has demanded to give compensation to farmers by getting the survey done. The storm on Sunday and Monday nights created havoc here and in Jaisalmer alone, crops worth Rs 2 billion (in approximately 2 to 2.5 lakh hectare land) have suffered damages. The Pak-displaced people on Wednesday submitted a memorandum to district collector Ashish Modi that they are residing in Narsing Oad Basti, Babar Magra since 2015 and around 34 families live there. In the last two days due to the storm, their houses and roofs of houses have blown away and thus they demanded to get compensation. Similarly, house of Rasool Khan, a resident of Raimal village in Ramgarh area collapsed in the rains. Two jawans of 139th battalion of BSF during their duty at the international border in the Tanot area were injured after they were hit by tin sheds that were blown away due to the storm. They were brought to BSF Hospital where they are undergoing treatment. More than 30 sheep of a cattle herder died at Poonam Nagar. Jaisalmer district collector Ashish Modi directed revenue officers of the district to assess the loss in their areas and submit a report to the district administration. On the other hand, crops on around 1 lakh hectare land in Barmer were ruined due to the rain and storm. In Barmer district, around 1.5 lakh farmers have got the crops insured by paying a premium of Rs 70 crore for 2020-21 Rabi crops, but due to the strike by patwaris, the girdawari is not being done and the loss is not being assessed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/storm-damages-crops-in-over-3l-hectares-in-jaisalmer-barmer/articleshow/81677313.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Overconfidence of coalitions in Kerala||On the eve of the elections in Kerala, one feature that characterizes all political leaders is overconfidence. It is common practice for politicians down the ages to express optimism about victory even when they know that they are down in the doldrums. But here, the overconfidence makes them say and do things without being aware of the dangers lurking around them. Kerala has a healthy tradition of bringing the two coalitions to power by turns so that each can spend half their term to undo what its predecessor had done and the other half to make their own mistakes. This disproves the theory that Kerala is a politically polarized state. There is obviously a swing group which remembers the evils of the previous government and votes for a change in the fond hope that the other side may deliver better. Consequently, the progress of the state is stalled. This time, the incumbent LDF government is confident that it will continue despite a battalion of scandals, corruption charges, allegations of anti-national activities in collusion with a foreign country and mishandling of sensitive issues, which should normally have brought the government down even before it completed its term. The campaign slogan of the coalition is that “return is certain.” Not only that, the latest opinion polls by different agencies and TV channels indicate that continuity is possible. Unsurprisingly, the ruling coalition bristles with overconfidence. The main opposition coalition, UDF, of which Congress is the leading partner is no less confident, as it believes that it is the only viable alternative for Kerala, even though not a day passes without defiance of the state and central leaderships on the selection of candidates. The release of the list of candidates in the name of the High Command culminated in a tonsure by a spirited lady leader. The coalition is expecting to return to power on the strength of the number of cases raised by it to discredit the ruling coalition. Muslim League, a component of UDF, has quietly planned things in advance, expanded the number of seats and announced its candidates. Normally, announcements by the supreme head of the party is never challenged by the party, but this time the candidate selection was questioned by some. The overconfidence of NDA is a true mystery as a wave in its favour is not in evidence. Metroman E Sreedharan has much to be confident about and he naturally expresses that confidence in modest terms. One swallow does not make a summer. He should have brought in some like-minded and capable people into the fray. The reality does not match the aspirations as of now. Hope the Metroman, with his outstanding credentials, will be in the Rashtrapati Bhavan a la Dr APJ Abdul Kalam one day. The confidence of parties has engendered a phenomenon this time, which can be characterized as “localitis”. The political parties have always been suspicious of “imported” candidates as they have their own hierarchy based on working at the grass roots levels. The recent experience of fortune seekers entering politics at high levels has led to extreme caution. This time the “localitis” became so acute that some good people became victims of this prejudice. The tragic flaw of overconfidence makes any prediction difficult and pollsters are waiting for the completion of the flow of “prominent” people from one coalition to another even at the last minute, believing that even a week is a long time in politics. The only prediction that can be made at this time is that there will be many surprises when the voting machines deliver the results.

S Nagarajan has been appointed as the new collector. S Davidson Devasirvatham is the new city police commissioner. The transfer orders, issued by ECI secretary Malay Mallick, were sent to the Tamil Nadu chief secretary on Tuesday. According to Mallick, ECI directed the state government to transfer Rajamani and Sharan to non-election posts based on inputs received. DMK functionaries had claimed that Sharan supported municipal administration minister S P Velumani. They had slammed police for registering cases against people who protested against the 24/7 drinking water supply project being executed by Suez Projects Private Limited. Two days ago, DMK filed a petition to Rajamani, who is also the district election officer, against AIADMK cadres for allegedly committing atrocities during campaigning. DMK’s legal wing approached ECI against the two officials, claiming that proper action was not taken. Additional director general of police (ADGP) Devasirvatham was attached to the Tamil Nadu Police Academy. Nagarajan was the director of the Entrepreneurship Development and Innovation Institute in Chennai. They will take charge on Thursday. Meanwhile, DMK has lodged a complaint with ECI against 14 cops. Besides Sumit Sharan, 11 police officers in the ranks of deputy superintendents of police and additional police officers were transferred to various posts.

---||Delhi||PM Modi acting as roadblock to AAP’s good work, says Sisodia||New Delhi: A day after the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill was passed in Rajya Sabha, deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Thursday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the move. “The GNCTD Bill passed by the Modi government reflects the deep insecurities of the PM and BJP. The nation and the world are talking about the Arvind Kejriwal model of governance. People have started looking at Kejriwal as an alternative to Modi. Due to this, a worried BJP made the move to stop the good works of the Kejriwal government,” said Sisodia. In a press conference, Sisodia said, “Nobody in this country has anything good to say about the PM or BJP’s style of governance. BJP has failed people in providing even the basic amenities. If Delhi can provide free water and electricity, then why can’t other states? Because the BJP or Modi model is just a tokenistic form of governance.” “AAP is consulting legal experts and will take a decision based on their advice about moving the Supreme Court. The AAP government will continue to fight for the people of Delhi and deliver despite all hurdles,” added Sisodia. Mentioning that the AAP government would continue to fight against “negative politics”, the deputy CM said, “Modi is endorsing negative politics and acting as a roadblock in the good work and progress of our nation. He should promote and reinforce good work done by individuals and public representatives. The PM is like a father figure who should support and aid the good work done by the CM of any state belonging to any political leaning instead of imposing blockades. This sort of revenge politics is not right. If someone is trying to do good work, you should support it instead of trying to erase history and blur lines.” “People of Surat voted for the Kejriwal model of governance. BJP is now losing sleep as we contested and won the panchayat and municipal elections. They know people are now understanding the positive politics of work by the Kejriwal government. This contentious Bill is purely a reflection of their fear and insecurity. But Arvind Kejriwal is a fighter and he will ensure the good work for the people never stops,” said the deputy CM. Claiming that the work done by the AAP government in the past six years was being talked about across the country, Sisodia said people of other states were also imploring their governments to provide basic facilities like free and 24x7 electricity. He added that people wanted free and excellent education and hospitals with proper facilities. “BJP is creating barriers to ensure that we cease to carry out all our activities and projects for the redevelopment of Delhi. The CM introduced home delivery of ration, which is a very important initiative, especially during the pandemic. But this, too, faced an obstruction from BJP. The Modi government could have replicated such a policy across other states, but it did not. Instead, it is creating hindrances in Delhi government’s work. They are creating obstructions towards providing quality education and healthcare to people of the city,” said Sisodia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pm-modi-acting-as-roadblock-to-aaps-good-work-says-sisodia/articleshow/81695999.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Coimbatore||Covid testing ramped up as cases spike||Coimbatore: The district recorded 147 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, taking the total number of cases to 57,563. While 95 people got discharged, the number of active cases rose further to 879 on the day. The district also recorded one fatality due to the virus, taking the death toll to 689. The victim was an 87-year-old man who was admitted with fever, cough and difficulty in breathing on March 19 and died on Wednesday morning.The vaccine shortage was felt across the district with major hospitals like PSG Hospitals and KMCH running out of the vaccines on Wednesday. Many people who contacted the above hospitals to take their second shot of Covishield were told to call back a day later. When TOI contacted them, both hospitals said they had received a small batch of Covaxin doses but had run out of Covishield.With Covid-19 cases in the district increasing by anywhere between 1% and 19%, the positivity rate seems to be galloping ahead of 3.5% that the district saw during the second week of March.Though deputy director of public health Dr G Ramesh Kumar insisted that the positivity rate over the last 10 days was only 2.9%, other health officers admitted that the positivity rate in the city had ranged between 5.7% and 6.8% since March 19. In a desperate bid to bring down both the number of cases and positivity rate, health officers have ramped up testing and contact tracing.“The number of samples being tested was around 2,500 a day in March first week. It was increased to 3,500-odd samples a day in the second week,” Dr G Ramesh Kumar said.“Now with cases increasing further, we have asked PHCs who do contact tracing to test more contacts of a positive case or family cluster including neighbours, work contacts etc., and isolate them to contain the spread of the virus,” he said. On Tuesday, more than 6,200 samples were collected and tested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/covid-testing-ramped-up-as-cases-spike/articleshow/81677316.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Those who got vax will also have to produce Covid -ve report to enter Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Those entering Rajasthan from other states will have to produce a Covid negative report (RT-PCR) not older than 72 hours from today (Thursday). Earlier, it was mandatory for travelers from Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Puunjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh, but now it has been mandatory for all the states. On Wednesday, the state reported the biggest single-day spike this month recording 669 cases. Health department teams will remain deployed at the entry points of all the districts to ensure that travelers entering the state by road should carry a negative report. The state government has made Covid-19 negative report (RT-PCR) mandatory to minimise chances of spread of new variants in the state. “Steps need to be taken in states to prevent spread of new variants of Covid-19 virus. In Rajasthan, those coming from other states must produce a RT-PCR negative report not older than 72 hours. Those found without a report, will be kept in quarantine for 15 days,” chief minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted. In another tweet, Gehlot said, “Ministry of health informed that in 18 states, new strains of Britain, South Africa and Brazil have been found, which is a cause of concern. According to experts, these strains spread fast. In such a situation, more alertness is needed.” From Thursday, the surveillance at airport, railway stations and bus stands will be intensified. “We held a meeting with the North Western Railway today in which we asked the officials not to allow any passenger getting off the train at Jaipur railway station without a negative report,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer, Jaipur (I). Tests will also be done at airport, railway stations and bus stands. Moreover,the health department has clarified that those who have received the two doses of vaccine will also need a negative report to enter any part of Rajasthan. “A vaccinated person may spread infection and so a negative report is mandatory,” said a senior health department official. Chief medical health officer (Dholpur) Dr Gopal Prasad Goyal said, “Testing has been intensified in the district. Since Dholpur shares border with UP and MP, checking of negative report for travelers of other states will be done at the entry points.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/those-who-got-vax-will-also-have-to-produce-covid-ve-report-to-enter-state/articleshow/81676535.cms||---

Calling governor BS Koshyari a ‘BJP family member’, he said, “So, opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis and other leaders meeting with the governor was like a family gathering." Speaking on Fadnavis’s allegations that Thackeray chose not to act on a report on the alleged police transfers racket, Raut told TOI: “The CM will speak at the right time...they (BJP) do not have any atom bomb, rather a damp firecracker which does not even have a wick...” On the Fadnavis-Koshyari meet, he said, “They all are official BJP workers. Some are in the state administration and some in Raj Bhavan. So, it was like a family gathering... The government is run by the CM, and not the governor. If they (BJP members) had met the CM and submitted documents, it would have helped to have a good dialogue between the two...Till Wednesday, Koshyari was a RSS pracharak, the chief minister of a BJP-ruled state, and held a Union minister’s post as a BJP member. So, is it an insult to call him a BJP worker?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cm-will-speak-at-right-time-governor-is-from-bjp-family-raut/articleshow/81679624.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Mumbai||Company slashes price of key drug by 70%; will cost Rs 900 a vial||Mumbai: Remdesivir, a critical drug being used in Covid-19 therapy, has become more affordable. Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila on Wednesday reduced its price by nearly 70%, from Rs 2,800 to Rs 900 per 100mg vial, while Mylan of Bengaluru is now offering it at Rs 600 for government procurement, sources told TOI. Other companies are expected to follow suit and reduce the MRP in the same range soon, said a top executive with a company that manufactures Remdesivir. The MRP of other brands currently ranges between Rs 4,000-5,400 per vial. The markdowns come after reports over several months of price gouging and black marketing of the drug, and shortages in several cities, including Mumbai and Delhi. Patients at private hospitals in Maharashtra have been shelling out at least 250% more for each dose of Remdesivir than the drug’s wholesale price. This had also prompted Maharashtra’s Food and Drug Administration to seek price caps from the central government. A minimum of six vials are required to treat a patient suffering from severe Covid-19, as per the protocol. Remdesivir is a part of the standard treatment protocol for moderate to severe hospitalised Covid-19 patients, with over 40% of such patients being treated with it. The price reductions are being made possible by lower costs of raw materials and huge volumes of production. “The cost of raw materials has gone down from around Rs 2,500/gm to Rs 700, while the volumes are high now. Last year, when we started producing the drug, there was no surety whether there would be significant sales. Sales peaked during the September-December quarter, with a lull in January and February this year. Over the last fortnight, there has been a huge surge in cases in certain states, and we are gearing up to ramp up capacity by 30-40%. Soon, there could be half a million vials in the market,” said the pharma company’s executive. Sharvil Patel, managing director of Zydus Cadila, hoped that the price reduction “will enable people from every strata of society to access this critical drug”. Remdesivir was first launched in June by Hyderabad-based Hetero at Rs 5,400. The price settled around Rs 4,000 a vial when other companies entered the market. The wholesale price (what hospitals and stockists are charged) is around Rs 1000, while patients have to pay the MRP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/company-slashes-price-of-key-drug-by-70-will-cost-rs-900-a-vial/articleshow/81678209.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

There are set parameters on the basis of which a panchayat, district or a state will be declared as TB free, which include prevalence of TB and detection of new cases.A centre team recently visited Bhilwara and Rajsamand, which the state claimed have achieved significant results in NTEP. However, the result of the survey done by the Centre in the two districts is awaited. Besides, Covid-19 pandemic has made an adverse impact on NTEP as the work remained affected.A total of 1.37 lakh TB patients were notified under the programme in 2020, a decrease of 21% (1.75 lakh cases) as compared to the same period in 2019.This decrease in TB notification happened nationally which is due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on TB services, repurposing of available resources and manpower, as well as various restrictions imposed to contain the pandemic, the Centre’s report said.For early diagnosis, the health department has improved its TB testing facilities. In the state, 59 Truenat machines have been installed, which is a new molecular test that can diagnose TB. The state government is decentralizing molecular diagnostics at block levels for TB screening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-eyes-at-making-2-panchayats-in-each-district-tb-free/articleshow/81676548.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Random antigen test numbers stay low for 2nd day||MUMBAI: On the second day of the random rapid antigen test (RAT) drive in the city on Tuesday, the BMC managed to conduct 17,782 tests, and 5% of them came positive for Covid-19, said BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Wednesday. It is nowhere near the target of 47,800 tests in a single day and was marginally more than the 15,771 tests run on Monday. In fact, tests over the first two days — 33,553 — together fall short of the target. The RAT were conducted on Tuesday at various crowded places namely malls, stations, market areas and bus depots. Of the total 17,782 tests, the maximum (2,661) were in L ward (Kurla), followed by H-East ward (Bandra East, Kalina) where 2,530 tests were conducted, and K-East ward (Andheri East, Jogeshwari) where 1,906 were done. L ward has the Kurla Nehru Nagar ST bus depot, LTT terminus and also Phoenix Market City mall under its jurisdiction. “In malls, we are testing staff of stores too as they could be super spreaders. With many customers visiting a store, in case of a staff being asymptomatic, the virus could spread further,” said Dr Jitendra Jadhav, medical health officer of L ward. Reacting to these tests, the Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI), which represents many major malls in the city, wrote to Chahal requesting the civic body to reconsider its decision of RAT tests before entry to malls as this would dissuade genuine shoppers and have a spiralling effect on retail. Instead, the letter said, BMC can start vaccination camps at malls across the city. “As a public infrastructure, with ample parking space and training rooms, malls do have the requisite space to help carry out such an exercise that will likely benefit the larger cause of carrying out an extensive vaccination drive…”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-random-antigen-test-numbers-stay-low-for-2nd-day/articleshow/81677355.cms||Richa Pinto

Hiran, whose explosive-laden Scorpio was found parked near Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25, was known to Waze, confirmed CCTV footage. Waze was trying to convince Hiran to surrender in the case, but he refused. Officials claimed that Waze feared that he would get exposed, so he decided to kill Hiran with the help of his associate. Officials said that bookie Naresh Gor had procured several SIM cards in the name of a Gujarat-based company and most of them were given to former police constable Vinayak Shinde on Waze’s instructions. Both Shinde and Gor have been arrested. An officer said, “Gor had visited the Mumbai Police headquarters where the Crime Intelligence Unit, then headed by Waze, is located. Gor handed over some SIM cards to Waze. His entry was recorded in the register maintained at the HQ. One of these SIM cards were used to call Hiran just before his death.”Hiran’s widow told investigators that after receiving a call on March 4 evening, Hiran told his son to close their Thane car accessories shop and came home early. Hiran told his wife that a Kandivli policeman named ‘Tavde’ had called him at Ghodbunder Road to advise him about the ongoing investigation. Hiran gave his bike key to his wife and went to meet Tavde in an auto. The next day, Hiran’s body was found in Mumbra creek. His phone was untraceable. The ATS examined Hiran’s mobile call detail records (CDR), but there was no information of any suspicious call at the time mentioned by his wife. The ATS then suspected that the call may have been made on a messaging app as they are not reflected in the CDR. Officials examined all phone numbers using data services at that particular time near Hiran’s residential building and shop and found 11,000 IP addresses active in both locations. Officials said they examined their details and identified the phone number from which the call was made to Hiran on March 4 evening. ATS traced the company on whose name the SIM was procured and it led them to Gor, who admitted that he had handed over that number to Waze at his CIU office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/last-call-to-hiran-ats-scans-11k-ip-addresses/articleshow/81678892.cms||Vijay V Singh

The figure is about 38% of 241 cubic metric tons that were required at the peak of the surge recorded after Diwali festivities in 2020. “The figures reveal that while cases are on the rise, hospitalization or oxygen requirement– which indicates severity of the infection – has not increased proportionately. Thus, there are fewer number of hospitalized patients and majority of positive patients have mild to moderate symptoms,” said a senior health department official, adding that home isolation and treatment is preferred by many of the patients. Meanwhile, the surge in positive cases continued on Tuesday with 1,790 new cases in 24 hours – at the rate of average 19 cases every 15 minutes. The state also recorded deaths of eight positive patients, the highest in 2021 and in 97 days. The case mortality rate increased from 0.2% on Tuesday to 0.4% on Wednesday. The new cases included 506 from Ahmedabad and 480 from Surat cities. The cities also recorded two deaths each. The core committee on Covid-19 constituted by the state government met on Tuesday. Sources close to the development said that a majority of members opined that the surge could well be associated with mutation of virus and it requires further study. A few members stressed on improved random sampling from existing 5% of the samples to understand the surge in cities like Ahmedabad and Surat. “The experts have also advocated understanding the status of the new patients in terms of their vaccination intake. If we have the data on vaccinated persons coming with Covid-19 infection, it will provide us a peek into whether the vaccine is reducing the severity and mortality of the infection. As we are using the two vaccines, it can also help us compare the results,” said an official close to the development, adding that final decision is yet to be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/oxygen-use-at-38-of-post-diwali-surge-level-state/articleshow/81676619.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||First-time Cong MLAs flag late grants in sitting with Kishor||Chandigarh: At the first-time Congress legislators’ first interaction with the Punjab chief minister’s newly appointed political adviser, Prashant Kishor, on Wednesday, a section flagged unfulfilled elections promises and late release of promised grants to each constituency. Sources said Kishor had asked the MLAs about their perception of the incumbent Congress government and its chances of making a comeback under chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. The MLAs used this chance to list the pending developmental projects of their areas. Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar joined none of these one-on-one meetings. An MLA who attended the meeting said: “The state’s two issues are sacrilege and drugs, and the Congress government has acted on both but people expect us to do more, for which we still have a few months.” Bhoa MLA Joginder Pal said: “Kishor asked us if we were happy with the CM and our reply was yes.” On the condition of anonymity, another MLA said the group had highlighted the unfulfilled poll promises and how the late release of the pending rural development fund (RDF) was delaying the planned Rs-25-crore development push for each assembly constituency. Gill MLA Kuldeep Singh Vaid said Kishor had called the MLAs in batches of two to three and taken detailed notes. He said: “The discussion covered each constituency... I demanded that new bus permits for my area and a college on priority.” He denied any discussion on former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and other political issues. Hargobindpur MLA Balwinder Singh Laddi suggested to Kishor to cover more families under the ration card scheme and rationalise the electricity tariff. It was the first round of interactions with the Congress MLAs to get their feedback on the functioning of the state government. Reports are that 37 MLAs sat with Kishor at the CMs’s official residence. Kishor’s team had planned 2017’s winning Punjab election campaign of the Congress. After the meeting, Qadian MLA Fateh Jang Bajwa said the Congress government still had year to fulfil its promises. He said: “Voters, not the rival parties, will give a verdict on our performance. The Congress has a fair chance in the elections, if we got our polls planks right.

The changeover of traffic flow on Park Street and other adjacent roads at 1pm may take a break while the eastward movement of vehicles on Mahatma Gandhi (MG) Road may be restricted now. The reason behind trying out the new system is to assess whether a wider Park Street is better equipped than Theatre Road to handle the city-bound flow of vehicles from Parama flyover. Similarly, Strand Road (North) is now one-way but there is still no official notification regarding this. There is also an appeal to make MG Road entirely one-way and divert east-bound buses, allowed now on the road, via Canning Street and Colootala. These new plans are part of a robust exercise that has been undertaken by Lalbazar to review the existing one-way roads across the city. Sources said that almost 90% of one-way roads in the city were marked several years ago and a review has been pending for a long time. “Since then, there has been a change in traffic pattern. While some accidents took place due to the attempts of locals to disregard the one-way traffic rules, the timings might need to be changed on other roads. As this will involve the study of traffic across a long stretch, we asked the individual guards to submit their recommendations. We have completed the study at the guard level and a decision on implementing some of the decisions will be taken soon. We want the new recommendations to come into effect after the elections in May when we complete the trial runs,” said a police officer.  The review exercise, said sources, was launched almost three months ago. Some of the busy roads like Elgin Road, Loudon Street, Dargah Road and Monoharpukur Road come under the study. Other roads like Woodburn Park Road and Ironside Road don’t handle too much pressure. Once the one-way roads are finalised, cops will check whether proper signboards have been put up there for public awareness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/plans-afoot-for-one-way-traffic-rejig-on-city-roads/articleshow/81676629.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The revised price of petrol was Rs 97.40 per litre while diesel was retailing at Rs 88.42 per litre. The last time the price of vehicle fuel fell in the city was on September 22 last year, when it dropped by a few paise to Rs 87.74 a litre for petrol, after which it kept escalating. The last price rise for petrol and diesel came on February 27, when petrol touched Rs 97.57 per litre in the city and diesel, Rs 88.60. The rates remained unchanged for the 24 days till Wednesday. Parbhani, which had the highest petrol price in the state at Rs 99.72 per litre, saw the fuel pull back to Rs 99.55. Various factors impacted the price of fuel, which includes the rupee to dollar exchange rate, cost of crude oil, global cues and demand. The cost of crude for the country dropped below $64 per barrel from more than $68 a fortnight ago, and the downward trajectory marked a decline of 5%, which was in line with the global benchmark Brent declining 10%. In recent months, Shiv Sena, AAP and MNS had raised their voice against the rising fuel rates and there were agitations on the streets, but neither the state nor the Centre reduced taxes, VAT and excise duty on the fuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/petrol-down-by-17-paise-in-mumbai-city/articleshow/81676643.cms||Somit Sen
---||Delhi||Delhi: Mayors plan to approach lieutenant governor to get ‘dues’ cleared||NEW DELHI: With the passage of the GNCTD (Amendment) Bill in Rajya Sabha, the corporations are again planning to move the lieutenant governor’s office regarding their claims of funds pending from Delhi government. The mayors said they were forced to move court to get their share of taxes after every quarter. Earlier, a report had been prepared by North Delhi Municipal Corporation as a road map for financial recovery with proposals like merger of the finance departments. Plans are afoot to revive the proposal in the pre-election year. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said with the LG being empowered, they were expecting justice to be finally done to the civic bodies by getting their rightful share of funds. “At the end of the financial year, the court had intervened by ordering Delhi government to release Rs 900 crore to the corporations. If these funds had been released on time, we would have paid salaries promptly,” he added. The BJP-led civic bodies and Delhi government have been fighting over allocation of funds for long. While the corporations claimed that the AAP government had deliberately starved them of funds, the latter stated that all funds had been released. The matter was taken to Delhi High Court on several occasions. Meanwhile, the pendency of salaries kept on rising and strikes by staff became frequent. South Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Anamika said that senior functionaries were making a joint action plan to be presented to the LG. “The special powers of the LG have been increased because Delhi government was disrupting the constitutional order of things. Now, the functioning of the administration will be much smoother and the civic bodies will get their share of taxes,” she added. East corporation mayor Nirmal Jain said routine tax share allocation cannot be carried out with repeated intervention of the court. “Just yesterday, the court ordered Delhi government to release Rs 360 crore to EDMC. We were forced to sit on a dharna outside the CM’s house for 13 days just to get funds to pay salaries to our employees. Even routine things are being done with court orders. This is a clear violation of the constitutional scheme. We hope that things will turn around now,” he added. Jain pointed out that the annual budget allocation for the three corporations was decreased by Rs 600 crore. “If we consider the pending dues since AAP came to office, all three civic bodies have been deprived of Rs 13,000 crore,” he claimed. AAP has repeatedly denied such claims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mayors-plan-to-approach-lg-to-get-dues-cleared/articleshow/81696129.cms||Paras Singh

Health minister Eatala Rajender informed the assembly on Wednesday that to begin with the government wants to take up vaccination of those aged above 25 years in the state, depending upon the vaccine supplies from the central government. “The situation may turn alarming in two to three months, but the state government is gearing up to check the spread of Covid-19 coming in the form of a second wave. All those who have taken their first and second dose of vaccine should also follow Covid guidelines strictly.. Experts said those who had tested positive earlier and recovered, are also getting infected in the second wave. I appeal to everyone to take all precautions. The government and the people had collectively and effectively checked the spread of novel coronavirus last year and need to do it again now,” he added. Stating that already there was a surge in cases in neighbouring states, especially Maharashtra, and that there was a lot of inter-city travel between Hyderabad and Pune, Nagpur, Solapur and Bhiwandi, he said there was every scope of the coronavirus spreading in Telangana. As per the central government report, Telangana is among the three states in the country which have effectively checked the spread of coronavirus in the last one year. “Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has said there is no shortage of remdesivir. Over 5,000 beds with oxygen facilities have been created and 5,000 manpower recruited in hospitals on contract basis. Tertiary and secondary care hospitals are being strengthened,” he said. The minister also sought to assure the people that all the vacancies of specialists, doctors, nurses and paramedical staff would be filled up within 3 to 5 months. As many as nine medical colleges along with hospital facilities would be upgraded with facilities on par with tertiary care centres to reduce the load on Gandhi Hospital, Osmania Hospital, Niloufer among other tertiary hospitals in the state, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/faced-with-threat-of-2nd-wave-state-asks-centre-for-more-doses/articleshow/81676641.cms||Roushan Ali

With the touch of a button, he cleared the transfer of 10,099 teachers and volunteers to station of their choice purely on merit basis. Education minister Vijay Inder Singla was also present on the occasion. A total of 35,386 online applications were received from aspiring teachers and volunteers, of which 15,481 were found ineligible as they were short of the prescribed parameters of the policy. The remaining 19,905 were found eligible for transfer. For the first time, computer teachers and various categories of education volunteers were brought into the ambit of the Teachers Transfer Policy. Speaking on the occasion, Amarinder said the unique transfer policy has been instrumental in successfully achieving the goal of quality education through filling of vacant posts. This has helped in ensuring uninterrupted academic sessions, besides giving enormous job satisfaction to teachers to work at places of their choice exclusively on merit. Under the online system, so far over 50% transfer applications have been approved with utmost transparency. As many as 10,099 teachers, including 4,405 masters, 3,748 primary teachers and 718 lecturers, as well as adequate number of computer teachers working under Punjab ICT Education Society (PICTES), have availed the benefit of the policy, apart from different categories of education volunteers and education providers working under ‘Smagra Sikhiya Abhiyan’. BOX TEACHERS’ TRANSFER ACT ON ANVIL The chief minister said that the state government would soon enact the Teachers Transfer Act for transfer of teachers, in place of the existing system of notification issued by the school education department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amarinder-digitally-orders-mass-transfers-of-19k-schoolteachers/articleshow/81678216.cms||---

The maximum temperature may touch 38 degrees Celsius by Sunday, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). On Wednesday, the maximum temperature was 34.2 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 16 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal. The humidity oscillated between 74% and 33%. Met officials said the maximum temperature had dipped under the influence of a western disturbance and there would be a slight variation in mercury on Thursday. The maximum and minimum temperatures on Thursday will be around 33 and 17 degrees Celsius, respectively. Strong surface winds are also predicted. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “There would be a steep rise in temperatures in the next two days. However, there is no chance of a heatwave this month.” For the first time this year, the maximum temperature is likely to touch 36 degrees Celsius on Friday. On Saturday, it may be around 37 degrees. Meanwhile, Delhi’s air improved to the ‘moderate’ category on Wednesday due to rain and strong winds.

---||Chandigarh||Experience is my biggest strength, says Amarinder on suitability to lead Punjab||Chandigarh: Ruling out any threat from other major political parties in the next assembly elections in Punjab, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said he believed his experience in the Army and of governing the state will help him handle the challenges of the state beyond 2022. Speaking at a media event, Amarinder trashed the a voter survey that gave Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) a lead in the 2022 assembly polls, as a “paid job” of party supremo Arvind Kejriwal. The AAP leader has a huge media budget he can use to buy such surveys, he said, adding that Kejriwal’s party posed no risk to the Congress in Punjab. “This same company had predicted 100 seats for AAP in 2016/17, and everyone knows how many they ultimately got,” he said, adding that Kejriwal and his party would meet the same fate in 2022. Pointing out that the Delhi chief minister had failed to implement even 30% of his promises in his previous terms, Amarinder said Kejriwal should focus on his own state instead of talking rubbish in Punjab. “He talks about giving jobs to Punjab when his own track record in Delhi is pathetic,” he said. As for Akalis, said Amarinder, they are a divided lot and the party is splintering, with nobody to hold them together. “Badal is no longer in a position to lead the party due to his age,” he said. On the BJP’s prospects in Punjab, his response was “Which BJP?” “The party has no support base in the state, where people are in fact angry with them,” he said, adding that the BJP could even end up getting back with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in desperation. On his own suitability to lead his party in the next polls, Amarinder said no one was indispensable if they believed they could help Punjab. He said he had experience in handling the state, especially agriculture which he had been managing since 1985, whenever in office. “Industry has to grow, and they have to have confidence in the leadership,” he said, adding that the fact that the state has received Rs 73,000 crore on-ground investment since his government took over in 2017 showed their confidence. Further, said the CM, Pakistan also needed to be dealt with an iron hand and his past Army training could help him tackle the threat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/experience-is-my-biggest-strength-says-amarinder-on-suitability-to-lead-punjab/articleshow/81678214.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Locals oppose underground tank at Pramod Mahajan Park||MUMBAI: Thousands of Dadar (west) residents are up in arms against the BMC’s decision to dig up the 13-acre Pramod Mahajan Udyan to construct an underground water-holding pond. Residents fear they will lose the massive green space on Senapati Bapat Marg that is home to hundreds of trees, birds and fish ponds. Local BJP MLA Kalidas Kolambkar has written to municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal demanding construction work be stopped and the underground tank be moved to a BMC plot nearby. Times ViewTackling flooding in Hindmata is important, but it cannot be done at the cost of losing prime green space. There is a major dearth of open spaces in the city and this park is extensively used by senior citizens. The BMC must look for an alternative location for the water-holding pond.“The Pramod Mahajan Udyan is one of the best maintained green spaces in this area and is used by hundreds of senior citizens. Construction of the water-holding pond will completely destroy the park. There is a storm water drain (SWD) department plot nearby lying unused. The pond can be constructed there. Locals residents have protested against this project and I urge you to stop the work,” the letter states. He said over 2,500 residents had signed a petition to save the park. The park was developed in the early 2000s. Locals said hundreds of trees would be sacrificed for the project and they didn’t trust the BMC to restore the park to its original shape after work on the water-holding pond was completed. The BMC has set a target of constructing two tanks near Hindmata by June— one at the Pramod Mahajan Udyan and the other at St. Xavier’s ground in Parel—to prevent flooding during monsoon. Each tank will have a capacity to store about 30 lakh litres of water. The project will cost around Rs 40 crore. “Water-holding ponds are common flood mitigation measures adopted internationally. Locations decided are based on contour, slope and proximity to flooding areas. The tank will occupy only a limited area in Pramod Mahajan Park. Full restoration will be done on completion of work. Care has been taken not to disturb the local ecosystem too much. Only the lawn portion with some very minimal trees will be disturbed,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-locals-oppose-water-tank-in-park-at-dadar/articleshow/81677382.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The board has named Subir Bhattacharya, the senior-most faculty member, as the director-in-charge, till a director is selected. Bhattacharya, who teaches management information systems, will assume charge from Thursday. “Things will soon be normal. I am sure with the help of the board and the faculty, we will continue to achieve,” he told TOI. Seth and the board had sparred over several issues and in her resignation letter, which she sent to the chairman of the board and the PMO, she levelled several charges against the board and also some faculty members. She claimed “legacy issues” ailed the institute. The board issued a statement, saying Seth made “baseless and self-serving assertions against the institute and board”. A month before her resignation, Seth wrote to the ministry of education, claiming her executive powers were infringed upon by the board chairman, Srikrishna Kulkarni.

---||Mumbai||SGNP keeps tabs on radio-collared leopards’ moves||MUMBAI: Savitri, the 3-year-old radio-collared leopard has been tracked, taking a stroll around Tulsi lake at SGNP, then drifting towards Vihar lake and coming back. She frequents the southern part of the national park and Yeoor section of the forest. Tracking her trail by researchers has revealed she had feasted on a pet dog. Her resting place gives her a panoramic view of the city. Maharaja, between 6 and 8 years of age, has crossed over from SGNP into Tungareshwar wildlife sanctuary, climbed a hill which has a spectacular view of the sunset. Since he was collared on January 22, he has done two trips to the sanctuary. During one of his sojourns in Tungareshwar, his pugmarks were seen with that of a female leopard. The area is known to have a female leopard. Their relationship will be revealed as researchers continue tracking. “Maharaja has crossed Chincholi-Bhiwandi bypass, Vasai-Diva railway line to move from SGNP to the wildlife sanctuary. While he has crossed the road at the same spot, the railway line has been crossed at different points. He has used natural culverts to go across and we found chicken remains at one spot he had been to,” said Nikit Surve, member of Wildlife Conservation Society, which along with park authorities have undertaken a 2-year study of leopards using radio collars to know how they move and have adapted to an urban landscape. The site of Maharaja’s crossing will see three major infrastructure projects coming up in the future. Experts have suggested a connected underpass and an overpass for the animals to cross this section to avoid fatalities. The male leopard has walked 62 km by night and another 8 km by day and returned to the park. Savitrihas walked lesser. Both have fed on domesticated animals, indicating movement in proximity to human habitats. While Savitri has been fitted with a satellite-based radio collar, Maharaja wears a GPS-based collar. The battery life will allow tracking for 6,000 locations and can last for a few months or even two years before the collar falls off on its own, said Vidya Athreya, senior scientist Wildlife Conservation Society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sgnp-keeps-tabs-on-radio-collared-leopards-moves/articleshow/81677394.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Patna||Oppn gears up to legally challenge new Bihar police bill||Patna: A day after the passage of the Bihar Special Armed Police (BSAP) Bill, 2021, by the state assembly, major opposition parties and concerned citizens are actively contemplating challenging the enactment of the BSAP Act either in the Supreme Court or the Patna High Court through writ petitions. Asked if RJD is likely to challenge the BSAP Act, party senior in the House Alok Kumar Mehta said, “We are in the process of discussing the next course of action to be adopted to challenge the Bill. Things are in discussion.” Similarly, the Congress legislature party (CLP) leader in the assembly, Ajeet Sharma, is not averse to challenging the BSAP Act in the Patna High Court through a writ petition, while CPI(ML) MLA Sandeep Saurabh said his party would hold legal consultations with Supreme Court lawyers on the matter in Delhi “after two days,” so that a writ petition can be filed against the BSAP Act. Senior Patna HC lawyer Basant Kumar Choudhary has already made up his mind to challenge the BSAP Bill once it becomes an Act after the governor gives his assent to the Bill. “I will wait till the gazette notification is made. After that, I, as a citizen and lawyer, will move the high court through a writ petition. Any citizen can challenge the Act,” Choudhary said. The BSAP Bill first came to the House when its copies were made available to all MLAs on March 19 for amendments during the debate slated for March 23. However, it evoked strong reactions from the opposition members that saw protests from the opposition – RJD, Congress, CPI(ML) and AIMIM – in the House. In the absence of opposition members on March 23, energy minister Bijendra Yadav, in his reply backing the Bill, said there was nothing sinister about them and asserted that it had been brought in only to facilitate the name change of the Bihar Military Police (BMP) and give teeth for their deployment and use in the new avatar as the BSAP. Yadav also spoke on Section 7 that gives power to BSAP officials to arrest any person on mere suspicion and without a warrant, while Section 8 gives the power to conduct searches without a warrant, or when it is presumed by the BSAP official that the person under a cloud has committed the offence. Section 15 ensures that no court will take cognizance of the complaint against any BSAP official. Speaking on the occasion, CM Nitish Kumar referred to the terror attacks at Gandhi Maidan (in the rally of the then PM aspirant Narendra Modi in October 2013) or on Mahabodhi temple at Bodh Gaya in 2013, and asked, “If something is happening at Bodh Gaya, or even in Gandhi Maidan, will the BSAP personnel act only after seeking permission? If the firing is taking place, will they wait to seek permission? The BSAP personnel will be deployed at any place as per the decision of the government.” Be it, Congress's Sharma, RJD’s senior member Alok Mehta, or Sandeep Saurabh from the CPI(ML), and even Akhtarul Iman from the AIMIM, they had objections to Sections 7, 8 and 15. They also pointed to their fears about the grievous collateral damage, like tortures in custody to extract information, and even custodial death, as the law is perceived to assume that the person under suspicion is a criminal or has made the offence. “The Bill should have been sent to the select committee like it is done in Parliamentary Standing Committee in Parliament,” Sharma said. Iman said, “The Bill was brought in and introduced in the assembly in a haste. Its provisions are draconian whose implications immediately come to mind.

The project aims at reducing traffic congestion and improving connectivity in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. “We will have to measure around 860 hectare land in various tehsils by the end of this April. The appointed agency has worked in the Samruddhi Expressway project and got the required expertise and experienced manpower. We will work on a target basis to complete the work within the deadline,” MSRDC sub-divisional engineer Sandeep Patil. On Tuesday, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh and senior MSRDC officials held a meeting with the sub-divisional officers (SDOs) of Maval, Bhor and Mulshi to discuss the issues pertaining to issues such as land acquisition and opposition from the local farmers. The MSRDC will do 100% videography of the land plots to prevent any complications or allegations from the farmers in future. “Farmers often claim or allege that their houses or crucial property had been taken over for the project and seek compensation. If we produce videographic evidence, such challenges can be countered effectively in future. This strategy worked effectively in the Samruddhi project. We will implement the same model in in this project too,” Patil said. The MSRDC has decided to acquire land for a 68km western ring road that will pass through Maval, Mulshi, Velhe and Bhor tehsils.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msrdc-hires-agency-to-speed-up-ring-road-land-measurement/articleshow/81676670.cms||Sandip Dighe

In June 2020, the insurance watchdog had issued guidelines for insurance companies to roll out standard Covid-19 policies -- Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak – by July 10, 2020, for those between 18-65 years of age. Insurers were permitted to offer these policies till March 31, 2021. Coronavirus: Live updatesHowever, now insurers will be able offer and renew these short-term Covid-19 specific health policies up to September 30, 2021. Till January, around 1.28 crore standard Covid-19 policies with a total premium of over Rs 1,000 crore were sold by insurers. As per the norms, the Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak policies were allowed to be renewed for further terms of three-and-half-months, six-and-half-months or nine-and-half-months, as per the policyholder’s preference, till March 31, 2021. Now with the new IRDAI directive, policyholders will be able to renew these policies till September this year. In fact, in October last year, the regulator had also issued norms allowing porting as well as migration of standard Corona policies to comprehensive health policies. While the Corona Kavach is an indemnity-based product, Corona Rakshak is a benefit-based product. While benefit policies pay a fixed amount following a claim, indemnity plans provide either cashless or reimbursement facility for the money spent on medical treatment. Under Corona Kavach, apart from hospitalisation expenses for a minimum of 24 hours, home healthcare, Ayush treatment and pre as well as post hospitalisation costs is being covered. Under Corona Rakshak, a lumpsum benefit equal to 100% of the sum insured is payable on positive diagnosis of coronavirus, requiring hospitalization for a minimum continuous period of 72 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/insurers-can-sell-renew-standard-corona-policies/articleshow/81686792.cms||Swati Rathor

In June 2020, the insurance watchdog had issued guidelines for insurance companies to roll out standard Covid-19 policies -- Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak – by July 10, 2020, for those between 18-65 years of age. Insurers were permitted to offer these policies till March 31, 2021. Coronavirus: Live updatesHowever, now insurers will be able offer and renew these short-term Covid-19 specific health policies up to September 30, 2021. Till January, around 1.28 crore standard Covid-19 policies with a total premium of over Rs 1,000 crore were sold by insurers. As per the norms, the Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak policies were allowed to be renewed for further terms of three-and-half-months, six-and-half-months or nine-and-half-months, as per the policyholder’s preference, till March 31, 2021. Now with the new IRDAI directive, policyholders will be able to renew these policies till September this year. In fact, in October last year, the regulator had also issued norms allowing porting as well as migration of standard Corona policies to comprehensive health policies. While the Corona Kavach is an indemnity-based product, Corona Rakshak is a benefit-based product. While benefit policies pay a fixed amount following a claim, indemnity plans provide either cashless or reimbursement facility for the money spent on medical treatment. Under Corona Kavach, apart from hospitalisation expenses for a minimum of 24 hours, home healthcare, Ayush treatment and pre as well as post hospitalisation costs is being covered. Under Corona Rakshak, a lumpsum benefit equal to 100% of the sum insured is payable on positive diagnosis of coronavirus, requiring hospitalization for a minimum continuous period of 72 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/insurers-can-sell-renew-standard-corona-policies/articleshow/81676662.cms||Swati Rathor

The deputy chief minister said the local authorities had been given the power to enforce stringent measures, depending on the rise in Covid cases. He said some cities had gone for restrictions in movement during the night hours, while a few went for weekend closures. Ajit Pawar said restrictions should be in place as the cases were rising tremendously. He said the suburban trains were running in full capacity in Mumbai and it was a concern. Regarding the curbs in Pune, the deputy chief minister said some restrictions were enforced last week and he would review the situation again this week. He said he was taking regular updates from the commissioners and collectors on the same. Senior health officials are of the view that the local authorities should implement strict containment measures in marked zones. Earlier, state health minister Rajesh Tope had expressed concern over the rising cases in the state. During his visit to Pune on Monday, he had said districts like Pune, Nagpur and Mumbai were recording a spurt in cases. He had said while Maharashtra was carrying out adequate tests, there was a possibility of other states not reporting daily Covid-19 cases accurately. The Union health ministry on Wednesday stated that of the 10 districts in the country that were seeing a rise in cases, nine were from Maharashtra and one from Karnataka. The state’s nine districts are Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, Aurangabad, Nanded, Jalgaon and Akola.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-yet-to-take-any-decision-on-lockdown-ajit-pawar/articleshow/81676691.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Kavina argued that the notification for the appointment of Justice Mehta by replacing Justice (retired) K A Puj as sole member of the commission was faulty. He asserted that truncation of a commission is permissible, but replacement or substitution of a sole member is not permissible. This is possible only in the case of a vacancy or resignation, he said.In the rebuttal, advocate general Kamal Trivedi recounted SC’s criticism of state for the sluggish pace of action in fire incidents at Covid-19 hospitals. This led Justice Puj to tender his resignation and Justice Mehta was appointed, Trivedi said. He said there was a vacancy and it was filled, which the Commission of Inquiry Act allows.In response to HC’s questions, Kavina submitted that the relatives feel there is a cover-up and the people responsible are being shielded. He said relevant material was requested and permission sought to visit hospital’s ICU to expose the cover-up. To this, Justice Bhargav Karia of the bench headed by Chief Justice Vikram Nath commented that finding facts is the panel’s task. On the other hand, the advocate general submitted that the relatives, who have petitioned HC, did not remain present before commission when summons were issued to record evidence. Instead, he said, they chose to file plea demanding material and permission to cross-examine witnesses, to which they are not entitled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/shrey-fire-victims-kin-say-probe-panel-illegal-govt-rebuts/articleshow/81676702.cms||---

---||Delhi||AIIMS assault case: Bharti’s jail term suspended by HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Wednesday suspended the two-year jail term of AAP MLA Somnath Bharti in a case of assault on security staff of AIIMS. Justice Suresh Kait also stayed Bharti’s conviction in the case and sought response of Delhi government on his plea challenging his conviction and the sentence. The high court has posted the plea for further hearing on May 20. Earlier in the day, Bharti, who was sent to jail following his conviction on Tuesday, challenged the same before the high court. The trial court had upheld the conviction of Bharti under Sections 149 and 147 of the Indian Penal Code, along with Section 3 (mischief causing damage to public property) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. In his appeal Bharti argued that both the magistrate as well as sessions court “failed to appreciate that the petitioner had not committed any overt act nor used any criminal force nor assaulted anyone. Also, there is no evidence of formation of unlawful assembly for common object or for rioting, thus no ingredients of an offence under Section 147 /149 IPC can be made out against the petitioner.” The plea said that there is no incriminating evidence furnished by the prosecution to attribute any role / overt act to fulfill the ingredients of an offence under Section 3(1) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. In January a magistrate court had first found Bharti guilty and sentenced him to two year jail term which was then stayed by the sessions court. According to the prosecution, on September 9, 2016, AIIMS chief security officer RS Rawat lodged a complaint with Delhi Police accusing Bharti and his 300 supporters of misbehaving with the security guards of AIIMS. The complaint also alleged that Bharti gave permission to unauthorised people with earthmovers inside AIIMS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aiims-assault-case-bhartis-jail-term-suspended-by-hc/articleshow/81676718.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Vijayawada||Civic bodies in a scurry to boost tax collections||Amaravati: Authorities of urban local bodies, who were on their toes due to elections till recently, are running pillar to post to collect tax. Poor tax collections have put commissioners in civic bodies on tenterhooks as the state government has directed them to make all efforts to mop up revenue. According to latest reports, tax collections in over 120 municipalities and 13 municipal corporations have not touched 40% of the target. Property tax collections stood at Rs 1,129.76 crore against the target of Rs 2952 crore for the current fiscal, accounting for around 38% of the target. Continuous bank holidays over the next few days is also worrying civic authorities as owners of commercial properties would prefer to make cash transactions through banks. The commissioners have deployed additional teams comprising staff of ward secretariats for tax collection. With a week left for the closure of financial year, the government has asked municipal commissioners to open additional cash counters. It has also asked commissioners to ensure that special cash counters to work on Sunday and on public holiday on account of Holi on Monday. However, the commissioners said overall tax collections have gone up by 19% when compared to the previous year. Tax collections last year stood at Rs 942 crore when compared to the current year collection of Rs 1,129 crore. “We are hopeful of mopping up at least 15% to 20% in next few days from the total dues and take the total collections to nearly 75% of the target,” said a municipal commissioner. However, a senior official in the municipal administration department said that the current growth rate could not be compared with last year as entire normal life was hit due to the lockdown following the outbreak of Covid-19 in the last 10 days of last March and hence the collections were on the lower side. “We needed to put an extra effort to witness positive growth during the current fiscal. We can’t go soft on the dues now,” he said. Meanwhile, field level officials are in a fix as they have lost two months’ time before the end of fiscal due to poll preparations. This, along with the fact that markets had started functioning only from around October last year following the unlock guidelines, have impacted tax collections up until January. The entire administration was tied up with election work when tax collections were witnessing an up-tick in January. Water cess collections too have not been up to the mark across the state with only 35% of total dues collected. Civic bodies have collected Rs 205 crore against a target of Rs 561 crore for water user charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/civic-bodies-in-a-scurry-to-boost-tax-collections/articleshow/81675907.cms||Samdani MN

But on Tuesday, 3,468 beds were occupied in Vadodara and against these 1,522 active cases existed in nine districts including those sharing borders with Vadodara and even beyond. The 1,522 active cases include those being treated at home and those who have been kept at hospitals or Covid care centres in their respective districts. Sources said that it was largely serious cases and those wanting treatment in select hospitals that came to Vadodara.If details provided from districts are to be believed the number of patients coming to Vadodara was miniscule. For instance, details from Anand district reveal that the total number of active cases reached 69. Health officials from the district said that not a single patient from the district had been referred outside and all 55 hospitalised patients were being treated in the district.Details from Chhota Udepur reveal that the district has only 12 of the 62 active cases in hospitals. Sources said that only a couple of these were in Vadodara. Similarly, the health bulletin by Narmada district reveals that only eight patients from the district are being treated in Vadodara.Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel, however, explained the anomaly saying that the occupied beds included even suspected cases. “RT-PCR reports take time. Even if a person tests negative, he has to wait in the hospital till the test results arrive,” he said.Patel added that another major reason for occupancy of beds were delays in the processes of medical insurance. “We are trying to iron out the issues and may issue a notification with new guidelines,” said Patel.

The MP had complained against then ACP of Visakhapatnam I Chitti Babu and sub-inspector Murali for illegally detaining and manhandling him and using abusive language at Visakhapatnam airport on January 26, 2017. In his complaint, Vijayasai said the police stopped him and then leader of opposition YS Jagan Mohan Reddy by force and abused them when they were coming out of the airport to join a candlelight protest at RK beach. The privileges committee sought reports from AP police and Union home ministry. The state police said they had not granted permission for the candlelight protest and the attempt by the MP and other leaders was a clear violation of law and order. The police also informed the committee that they had informed the MP and others about the issue and the rejection of permission for the protest. The committee, after examining the facts, said there was no breach of privileges as Vijayasai had visited Visakhapatnam to take part in a protest and not to perform any parliamentary duty. It further observed that “protection of parliamentary privileges was not available” to Vijayasai at that point of time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vijayasai-plaint-dismissed-by-parliament-committee/articleshow/81675983.cms||---

His complicity in the crime is, prima facie, clear. If released on bail, there is a possibility that he may tamper with the prosecutions’ evidence and pressurise witnesses,” said judge Agarwal in an eight-page order. More was abducted by two men in a car on October 1, 2020, from a spot near the Shivajinagar district and sessions court and strangled to death in a moving vehicle. Later, his body was burned and disposed of in Tamhini ghat. His brother first lodged a missing person complaint with the Shivajinagar police on October 2 and later an abduction complaint on October 5. On October 18, the police arrested Kapil Phalke and Deepak Wandekar on the charge of executing the murder and lawyer Rohit Shende. Ghanshyam Darade was arrested on October 27. Investigations revealed that the anti corruption bureau (ACB), acting on More’s complaint, had trapped Shende on while accepting Rs1.7 crore on behalf of a revenue official in connection with an appeal over land in Parvati. Shende and the other accused were putting pressure on More to withdraw the complaint. but he refused. “This led to More’s murder,” police said. Special public prosecutor Ujjwala Pawar told the court that Shende had entered into a criminal conspiracy to eliminate More with the help of three accused, including Darade. Defence lawyer Harshad Nimbalkar prayed for Darade’s release on bail, He said Darade was arrested on suspicion, had no motive to kill More and nothing incriminating was found from him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/court-rejects-bail-plea-of-lawyer-in-murder-case/articleshow/81676716.cms||Asseem Shaikh

The government has proposed a Rs 3 garbage tax per day on every household within municipal corporations from the new financial year. However, civic associations are gearing up for protests opposing the decision. The municipal administration department has proposed a special action plan to handle garbage management across ULBs. Implementing door-to-door collection, segregation, scientific disposal of solid wastes, procuring vehicles for shifting garbage are parts of the action plan. The government had proposed the ‘garbage tax’ in September 2020 to get funds for garbage management. The proposal had sparked controversy across the state. Civic associations and taxpayers’ associations strongly condemned the proposal and staged protests. Following this, the state government in October 2020 suspended the proposal of ‘garbage tax’ for a while. But the proposal came to the fore again after the chief minister’s high-level meeting with municipal authorities. Authorities had proposed three different slabs of garbage tax for different categories of ULBs. The proposed tax is likely to add a burden of Rs 365 to Rs 1100 on residents. “The collection of garbage and scientific disposal is the responsibility of ULBs, and they are collecting property tax for it. Government imposed additional tax to escape duties of providing infrastructure to ULBs,” AP Urban Civic Forum convenor, Ch Babu Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/backlash-likely-as-govt-moots-garbage-tax-from-next-fy/articleshow/81675880.cms||Venu Lanka

Senior counsel P Raghu Sriram, Basava Prabhu Patil and Sanjan Poovayya appeared for the power generation companies and argued that the state government failed to implement the single bench orders and didn’t make payments as prescribed. “The court directed to pay Rs 2.43 paise per unit for wind energy and Rs 2.44 pause per unit for solar energy. But the discoms failed to pay single rupee and power generation companies are becoming bankrupt,” said the counsel for power generation companies.

In the wake of an increase in the number of Covid, cases and the government also directing that all educational institutions be closed temporarily, the film industry had urged the government not to consider imposing any restrictions on theatres. “We are strictly following protocols against spread of Covid by asking the audience wear masks. Sanitisation is also being done regularly. We are allowing fresh air into the cinema halls,” Telangana film chamber of commerce secretary M Vijendar Reddy told TOI. He said some theatre managements were also making masks available for sale for those who come without them. “In other cases is being given free of cost to people who ask for it,” Reddy said. Minster Srinivas Yadav said the Telugu film industry had suffered great losses due to the Covid situation. He said thousands of employees belonging to all the 24 crafts in the film industry were lost their income as there was no activity during the Covid lockdown. “There is no intention to impose any restrictions on theatres now. There are rumours that are being spread that the government wants to take such a step. Do not believe in such rumours. Theatres will continue to operate as they are doing now. Theatres will have to adhere to Covid guidelines which they are already following,” he said.

The double variant has a combination of two mutations — E484Q and L452R. The E484Q mutation has been detected in Maharashtra before and the L452R was found in patients in California, where experts believe it caused higher Covid spread. But director of the National Centre for Disease Control Dr Sujit Singh said, so far, no link has been established to say mutations alone have been responsible for the Covid-19 spike in some states. “There are various other reasons behind a surge,” he said. Genome sequencing of 223 samples from Mumbai has found the presence of the UK strain in 22 so far. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said all 22 patients have been treated and discharged. “We haven’t been told of any other variant or mutation being found in Mumbai so far,” said Kakani, adding that the results pertained to samples collected between December and February. Experts have said virus mutations are common and since December-end, at least 771 ‘variants of concern’ (VOCs) — from 10,787 positive samples — have been identified in the country. “Genomic mutation in RNA viruses is a normal phenomenon. About 5-6% mutation is considered normal,” said Singh. Singh said scientists are keen on going into the micro level to establish district-wise epidemiological linkage. “Only when these mutations are correlated with the existing public health scenario can we say that these new variants are a matter of concern. As of now, more scientific evidence is needed to say, with certainty, that the surge in Maharashtra is attributable to new virus variants,” he said. Singh said of the 1,600 samples from Maharashtra, 1,149 were from the community. Of these, 206 samples reported the double mutations (E484Q+L452R). Another 118 samples with just the L452R mutation and 112 samples with only E484 were also detected. “We are correlating the results. The mere presence of mutants does not reveal much, unless they also possess characteristics that are associated with faster transmission or severe infection.” The variant with a double mutation has now been categorised as a potential VOC.

Graphic: Ayaz DaruwalaA 350-metre long bridge with a barrage below will be constructed near the employees quarters of power station and will touch Sadar Bazaar Road on the other end of the Sabarmati river. These sluice gates underneath this bridge will create a reservoir holding some 12,000 million litres of water, about 15 days of water supply for the city. The barrage-cum-bridge was necessitated as water supply would be disrupted for 15 days because of repair work on the Narmada canal. The bridge will greatly ease traffic, which would get clogged on other routes at Maninagar and the main city bus stand at Geeta Mandir,” said a senior AMC official. The extensions will have promenades, a children’s park, a food plaza and a recreation zone. Following the irrigation department approval, experts from the Central Design Organisation (CDO) will help the AMC finalize the structure of the water barrage and the technology to be used. “Water levels of up to 4 meters will be maintained within the reservoir,” said an official in AMC water supply department. The total length of the riverfront, both banks included, will now be 34km. The two banks will also be connecting roads that will allow people from Maninagar and Narol to travel to Gandhinagar or towards North Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-tables-reservoir-project-for-govt-nod/articleshow/81676765.cms||---
---||Surat||Gujarat: Covid-19 +ve ‘thief’ jumps off ambulance, flyover; dies||SURAT: A vehicle theft accused, who had tested Covid-19 positive after being arrested, died after jumping out of an moving 108 emergency services ambulance and then jumping from a flyover. Diwan Bhabhor, a native of Banswara district in Rajasthan, was being shifted to the New Civil Hospital after testing positive. The incident happened late on Tuesday night and Bhabhor succumbed on Wednesday.  Bhabhor was caught by Kapodra police and handed over to Amroli police after his involvement was found in a motorcycle theft case in the latter’s jurisdiction. “He was sent to NCH in an ambulance and one policeman was sitting with him. He opened the glass window and jumped outside,” said an officer at Amroli police station. The door of the ambulance was locked.  “The cop sitting in the ambulance grabbed Bhabhor’s lefts to stop him from jumping and asked the driver to slow down the vehicle. But Bhabhor kicked him and jumped outside,” said Prashant Sumbe, in-charge deputy commissioner of police, zone IV.  The ambulance was on Katargam flyover bridge near Neelam Petrolpump at around 10pm when Bhabhor jumped off it. After falling on the road, Bhabhor got up on his feet and walked towards the flyover parapet. “He jumped from the flyover as well and suffered serious injuries. It looks like he wanted to escape police custody,” said police.  S M Patel, assistant commissioner of police, G-division, is investigating the case. “Since it is a custodial death case, a judicial inquiry will also be done and police will submit its inquiry report,” Sumbe added.  Bhabhor used to do casual labour work and lived on a footpath in Mota Varachha. His involvement was found in a motorcycle theft registered in Amroli police station on March 21. Police had recovered the stolen motorcycle from him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/positive-thief-jumps-off-ambulance-flyover/articleshow/81676403.cms||---

Or else, you will have to shell out Rs 800 for test and stay put in quarantine till the results arrive. AMC health teams will set up counters at the airport, railway station and highway entry points on Thursday to take samples for RT-PCR tests if you cannot furnish your test results. The notification from the state government states that passengers need to carry a negative RT-PCR test taken within 72 hours to enter the city. Almost 1,500 passengers arrive in Ahmedabad from 12 trains Mumbai and Pune at the Kalupur railway station. “A special counter will be set up at the exit by AMC health team to check for RT-PCR reports,” says the AMC health official. The Railway Protection Force will ensure that passengers wear masks before they alight on platforms to buy anything at vending outlets. On highways, thermal checking and RT-PCR report will be mandatory. “Those found with symptoms will not be allowed to travel further,” states the AMC health official, adding, “Passengers or commuters will have to pay Rs 800 for tests and move into quarantine till the test results come.” The state government issued a notification making RT-PCR negative test compulsory on Tuesday. Officials observed that contact tracing of Covid cases found in Gujarat over the past one week showed that a large number of infected people had returned from Maharashtra. A surge in Covid infections has forced several places like Maharashtra, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh to make the ‘negative RT-PCR test result’ mandatory for passengers seeking entry to the states. During first phase, AMC had carried out antigen tests on railway passengers. As many as 1,500 passengers had tested positive. Officials said that most of the passengers who tested positive were those travelling in second and third AC compartments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rt-pcr-camps-set-up-at-rly-station-airport-highways/articleshow/81676714.cms||---

With this, the cumulative tally of the hill state shot up to 98,880. Among those who tested positive for the virus on the day was former chief minister Harish Rawat and four of his family members. This comes a day after the senior Congress leader organised a ‘Holi Milan’ event, which was attended by hundreds of party workers, locals and folk artists. After his Covid-19 test returned positive, Rawat, in a Facebook post, wrote that he had finally been overpowered by “corona pehelwan (sumo)”. “Four of my family members and I have tested positive for Covid-19. All those who have come in contact with me till this afternoon must get themselves tested for the virus as a precautionary measure,” Rawat said in his post. Among other people found infected with Covid-19 on the day were seven students of Government Inter College in Ukhimath. They were tested by the health department during random sampling. Among the fresh cases recorded on Wednesday, the maximum of 71 were found in Haridwar, followed by 63 in Dehradun, 22 in Nainital, 14 in Udham Singh Nagar, eight each in Pauri, Rudraprayag and Tehri Garhwal, five in Pithoragarh and one in Almora. Meanwhile, the recovery rate of the state was recorded at 95.7% after 49 more people recovered from Covid-19 infection. The cumulative tally of cured cases now stands at 94,634 in the state. The active cases were recorded at 1,115 in the Himalayan state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-records-single-day-spike-of-200-covid-19-cases-after-two-months/articleshow/81675778.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Ahmedabad||Pandemic shrank Ahmedabad’s budget for the first time||AHMEDABAD: Call it the Covid effect — in a historic move, the municipal budget of Ahmedabad was cut by 23% compared to the previous year. In 2020-21, the budget approved was Rs 9,685 crore while for the 2021-22 financial year, municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar has proposed a budget of Rs 7,475 crore. Despite the blow, the focus is clear: more affordable housing and strengthening of civic utilities in newly acquired areas such as Bopal, Ghuma, Chiloda, and Kathwada. Provisions have also been made for 45 villages near the city, which may be taken into the municipal limits in the future. Another important aspect worth noting is that the AMC appears ambitious after the Rs 330 crore it earned from land monetization in 2019-20. This year, the target has been raised to Rs 1,000 crore. Also, the World Bank will provide its first installment of Rs 737 crore for sprucing up water treatment and distribution systems and augmenting sewage treatment facilities. “The construction of 20,000 affordable homes this year will have a catalyzing effect on the overall economy,” Mukesh Kumar said. Nevertheless, what stands out in the budget this year is the Covid hit. Revenue streams of the civic body have constricted. The biggest budget cut was seen in the 65% reduction in transfer to development expenses — or surplus revenue — by Rs 1,430 crore to Rs 754 crore in 2020-21 against the estimated Rs 2,180 crore. The budget estimates for development transfer for 2021-22 is Rs 1,425 crore, less than the envisaged development transfer in 2020-21. Even professional tax collection fell by one-third, to Rs 83 crore. “This may indicate loss of jobs, salary cuts, or closing down of units,” said a senior AMC finance department official. Similarly, general tax collection reduced by Rs 77 crore, water and conservancy tax by Rs 74 crore, and vehicle tax by Rs 39 crore, against what was estimated in the budget. Other non-tax revenue collections also fell short by Rs 960 crore. The only bright spot for the AMC is that the additional revenue receipts from grants, subsidies, and contributions from various sources will be Rs 1,180 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pandemic-shrank-citys-budget-for-the-first-time/articleshow/81676814.cms||---

Acting on Khalid’s plea, chief metropolitan magistrate Dinesh Kumar stated, “It is directed that while producing Khalid in the court on any day in future, sufficient steps should be taken by the jail superintendent and DCP, Delhi Armed Police, III Battalion, to ensure the safety and security of the applicant while bringing him from prison during his production in court and while taking him back to the prison.” The matter pertained to a rioting case registered by Khajuri Khas police station. Earlier, while dealing with Khalid’s plea on media trial, the court had highlighted that it was the duty of the press and media to inform and educate its readers or viewers of all relevant facts of a news report published or shown on a news channel. Khalid had stated that several news reports had relied on a “confessional statement”, which he had never signed, but news reports had attributed it to him. Khalid had stated that a supplementary chargesheet was leaked even before the court had taken cognisance. Taking note of his plea, the court highlighted that a confessional statement made to a police official was not admissible as evidence in law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-orders-police-to-ensure-khalids-safety/articleshow/81676739.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Aarey forest land for SGNP soon, but 5 acres for cop station||MUMBAI: Aarey forest land will soon be formally handed over to Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) but the total forest area is being reduced by five acres for Aarey colony police station. The government directed forest department to enable the park authorities to take possession of the land. Last year, the government declared 800 acres of Aarey Colony as forest. The state dairy development department, owner of Aarey Colony land, had proposed a police station for Aarey Colony and earmarked land for it but this portion was included in land identified for the forest. Early this month, the department requested the state revenue and forest department to exclude the five acres and take over the rest. It said the current police station functions out of a residential complex, and considering the rising population in Aarey Colony, it was difficult for the police station to work. On Tuesday, revenue and forest department wrote to the principal chief conservator of forests, Nagpur, to instruct SGNP authorities to take possession of 795 acres. It directed forest department to carry out a land survey and make changes in land records. The department will have to send a proposal for final notification for declaring the area as a forest. “There are increasing encroachments and fires in the area. This is maligning the government image. Take steps to provide sufficient staff to protect the forest and nearby areas,” the letter stated. In March, over 25 fires were reported from Aarey Colony, including Metro car shed. On Wednesday, park authorities requested the forest department for more forest guards and officials for the new area. G Mallikarjuna, director, SGNP, said the takeover would be done soon. “In the park, we draw fire lines and have squads who regularly patrol the forest to ensure there are no fires. There is a dedicated control room where messages are relayed and action is taken immediately if such incidents are reported. Once we take over the land, we can initiate similar protocol, but we will need more staff,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-aarey-forest-land-for-sgnp-soon-but-5-acres-for-cop-stn/articleshow/81676768.cms||Clara Lewis

The N440K variant that is associated with immune escape has also been found in samples from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The INSACOG is a grouping of 10 National Laboratories that was established by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, on December 25, 2020. INSACOG has since been carrying out genomic sequencing. “Genomic variants of various viruses are a natural phenomenon and are found in almost all countries,” it said. Since the consortium initiated its work, 771 variants of concern (VOC) have been detected in a total of 10,787 positive samples shared by States/UTs. These include 736 samples positive for viruses of the UK (B.1.1.7) lineage, 34 samples were found positive for viruses of the South African (B.1.351) lineage, one sample was found positive for viruses of the Brazilian (P.1) lineage. The samples with these VOCs have been identified in 18 states of the country. The N440K variant that is associated with immune escape has been found in 123 samples from 11 districts. This variant was earlier found in 33% of samples from Andhra Pradesh, and in 53 of 104 samples (50.9%) from Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/771-variants-of-concern-detected/articleshow/81676752.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Delhi||After half-a-century wait, Delhi firemen to finally get swanky new address||NEW DELHI: After around 54 years, Delhi Fire Service (DFS) will soon get its new headquarters by 2023. The plan for the new building, which would be built by the Public Works Department (PWD), has been finalised after several rounds of meetings and planning. Currently, DFS operates out of a building in Connaught Place, but has been facing a space crunch. The building was constructed in 1967 when Delhi had just four fire stations. From increased parking facility to technology-based infrastructure, the new headquarters will be a modern set-up. The state-of-the-art architecture will ensure all operational requirements are met and all administrative functionaries are accommodated. The building in Connaught Place consists of just the ground and first floors. Even though the staff strength has increased gradually, the space remains the same. Some of the officers are operating from temporary offices. The ground floor houses the fire control room, fire prevention wing, record room, reception and a few offices, while the first floor has the office of the DFS director, office of chief fire officer, deputy chief fire officer, accounts functionaries, legal wing, including the RTI section, and other related services. PWD will start construction of the new building from June. The height of the building will be 26 metres and the basement will be used for parking, service area and airconditioning plant. The lower ground floor will have the main control room, telephone exchange, wireless workshop, stores, media room and offices for the communication wing. Atul Garg, DFS director, said, “There will be a small exhibition hall, server room, facilitation cell, washroom and space for two fire tenders on the ground floor. On the mezzanine floor, a small conference hall, offices of fire prevention wing officers, recreation hall and gym will be made. On the second floor, there will be a double height conference hall for 120 people, fire prevention wing committee hall, record rooms, dining area and model room.” On the third and fourth floors, there will be space for officers of the fire prevention wing and a provision for the director's office, conference room, offices of the chief fire officer and their personal secretaries and a terrace garden. Apart from this, the new headquarters will also have an officers’ mess, guest rooms and changing rooms for decontaminated people. The building will also have a scape green, waterbody, provision for rainwater harvesting, a substation, circulation and access points, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-half-a-century-wait-firemen-to-finally-get-swanky-new-address/articleshow/81676773.cms||---

They handed over a memorandum to Baijal lodging protest over the move. Bidhuri also requested the LG to stall the AAP government’s plans to introduce doorstep delivery of ration. The BJP delegation told the LG that the government’s decision to close 500 government liquor shops and hand them over to the private players smacks of corruption. “Before 1980s, liquor trade in Delhi was in the hands of private traders. After regular complaints of sale of spurious liquor among other complaints besides mishaps due to spurious liquor, the then Delhi government took over the liquor trade and opened shops that have served the capital for the last around 40 years,” the BJP delegation stated. They added that the AAP government’s decision may put Delhi at risk of spurious liquor and cheap brands sale. The BJP functionaries also stated that the decision to open liquor shops in all wards may lead to disturbance of peace and law and order in many residential colonies. “It is strange that instead of working for equal distribution of water, the Delhi government is trying to ensure equal distribution of liquor,” said Gupta. The functionaries also opposed the lowering of the drinking age in Delhi. It is morally unwanted, they stated. Bidhuri said that he informed the LG that the Delhi government has decided to roll out the doorstep delivery of ration scheme without any nomenclature. “Under the doorstep delivery scheme, the AAP government wants to provide wheat flour in packets. I requested the LG to stall this scheme, which is not in sync with the National Food Security Act,” said Bidhuri. AAP did not react to the Delhi BJP’s demands. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia had on Thursday said that “the governance model of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is being lauded all across, which has rattled the BJP. It wants to stall the AAP government’s work through the amendment to the GNCTD Act.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-urges-lg-to-stall-new-excise-policy/articleshow/81696169.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While the active number of cases rose to 5,497 on Thursday from 4,890 a day ago, the positivity rate reached 1.69% from 1.52% on Wednesday. The positivity rate was 1.31% on Tuesday, 1.32% on Monday and 1.03% on Sunday. The new Covid-19 cases pushed the tally to 6,52,742, while over 6.36 lakh patients have recovered from the virus. There were 888 cases on Monday, 823 on Sunday, 813 on Saturday, 716 on Friday, 607 on Thursday, and 536 on Wednesday last week, said the data. Five deaths from the viral infection were resported in past 24 hours, taking the tally in Delhi to 10,978. The number of people under home isolation rose to 2,871 from 2,560 a day ago; while the containment zones rose to 1,076 from 976 on Wednesday, officials said. The caseload in the national capital on January 1 had stood at over 6.25 lakh and the total fatalities were 10,557. The number of daily cases had started to come down in February. On February 26, the month’s highest daily count of 256 cases was recorded. However, the numbers began to rise again in March and has been steadily increasing over the last few days. Health experts and doctors have attributed the “sudden rise” in coronavirus cases to people turning complacent, not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. The next two-three months may prove challenging, they said, adding the situation can be kept under control if vaccination is opened up for more people and Covid-19 protocols are strictly adhered to. Amid a rise in coronavirus cases, DDMA had on Tuesday ordered that there will be no public celebrations during upcoming festivals, including Holi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-cases-in-last-4-days-than-entire-feb/articleshow/81696187.cms||---

He said the government is planning to set up clinics in Karimnagar, Warangal and Khammam municipal corporations in a phased manner. Responding to queries of members in the assembly during question hour on Wednesday, the minister said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had sanctioned 350 clinics in the state. Of them, 224 have already been functioning in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits. “The concept of establishing clinics is to provide medical facilities closer to bastis. The poor people had to rush to corporate hospitals for small ailments and cannot bear the expenses. This concept was taken from Delhi Mohalla clinics, which became a huge success,” Rajender said. “The clinics were set up in bastis which have over 10,000 population and in areas where urban primary health centres are not available,” the health minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/basti-dawakhanas-to-be-set-up-in-more-corporations-in-t/articleshow/81676779.cms||---

Frequent closure of roads is causing inconvenience to over 3.5 lakh population and thousands of commuters using these stretches in the northeastern parts of Secunderabad. A delegation of Federation of North Eastern Colonies of Secunderabad (FNECS) met principal secretary, MAUD, Arvind Kumar recently and explained about the hardships they face due to closure of 21 civilian roads. They said the Local Military Authority (LMA) often resorts to closure of the roads without following due procedure.

A senior official with the PMPML traffic department Said that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has provided them with 30 men. Moreover, 10 additional men have been deployed at as many bus stops along the corridor. “It has been almost two months since the corridor was opened and many private vehicles were found illegally entering the corridor. Hence, we spoke to the PMC and they provided 30 men. In addition, we have deployed one person at each bus stop to provide information to commuters regarding buses and routes. Since the corridor doesn’t have automated doors, the men are there to ensure safety of commuters,” the official told TOI. The wardens alleged that most people do not listen to them. “While we have been successful in ensuring that a majority of private vehicles do not enter the corridor, some motorists refuse to adhere to rules. They forcibly enter the corridor and pick up a quarrel with us. The police are there in the morning and evening, but they cannot be present all the time,” one of the wardens said. The BRTS corridor is among the oldest corridors to come up in Pune and become fully operational from February after missing more than five deadlines. “Most people who do not follow regulations are locals. They tend to boss around and threaten to beat us up,” another guard said. The PMPML has a plan to install boom barriers along the corridors. Earlier, PMPML chairman-cum- managing director Rajendra Jagtap had said that procurement of barriers would begin in April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-employees-face-tough-time-dealing-with-errant-motorists-at-katraj-swargate-brts-corridor/articleshow/81676783.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Kozhikode||For UDF & BJP, Trikaripur would be an uphill task||Trikaripur: At daybreak on a warm Sunday, UDF candidate MP Joseph finds himself unusually busy. For him, the Sabbath is not a day of rest anymore. Just three days in Trikaripur constituency, a ‘red bastion’ for last 60 years, the former IAS officer clad in traditional Congress worker’s attire is preparing to leave for his first mass in the nearby church in town. “This place is like a West Bengal town where you are deprived of your basic right to vote a candidate of your choice without fear. Polling agents aren’t allowed inside booths, voters are threatened and votes are cast by CPM supporters making a mockery of the system. Where else do you see such a high voting percentage,” Joseph asks crossing his legs and leaning on the empty chair next to him at his temporary residence behind Trikaripur railway station. Trikaripur, which sent communist stalwarts like EMS Namboodiripad and EK Nayanar to the assembly, had registered a voter turnout of 81.5% in the previous assembly elections. Sitting MLA M Rajagopalan, who is seeking a second term, had trounced UDF’s candidate by 16,959 votes in 2016. But, UDF said it could easily flag 9,500 duplicates in the voters’ list and steps to contain malpractices like booth capture and bogus voting can change its poll fortune. Trikaripur includes Cheruvathur, East Eleri, West Eleri, Kayyur-Cheemeni, Padne, Pilicode, Trikaripur and Valiyaparamba grama panchayats and Nileshwar municipality. While panchayats like Kayyur-Cheemeni are traditional CPM fortresses, Joseph hopes to make inroads in places like East Eleri and West Eleri as those have a sizeable Christian population from Kottayam belt. “We are hoping that Congress rebels in places like East Eleri that had led to the party’s decimation in those areas and even ruled the panchayat by floating a new party Democratic Development Front, will work in our favour,” said a senior campaign member in UDF. UDF also pointed out several issues like backwardness of panchayats like Valiyaparamba, immensely blessed by nature with thick mangroves and water-locked on three sides, is yet to be a beneficiary of state-sponsored clean water projects. “I am crossing a river after every 0.5km and scarcity of drinking water in such a place is unheard of,” Joseph said. UDF blames CPM for suppressing development for political gains. “Even in issues like IS recruitment that were reported from places like Padne, happened because of frustrated youth; they lacked jobs and were vulnerable. Suppressing developments for vote bank politics would create several such problems,” he said. However, it seems CPM is not taking Joseph seriously. “Had it been a Congress candidate, they could have at least put up a fight,” is the first reaction of CPM district secretary M V Balakrishnan. Rubbishing allegations, he said that places like Valiyaparamba were traditionally with UDF and it couldn’t do anything for the place. He said that one should also look at the larger picture like Kasaragod and Manjeswaram that have traditionally sided with UDF. “If you compare backwardness of these constituencies with Trikaripur, you will get a better picture of reality. Even the hill highway project is stuck in Kasaragod,” said Balakrishnan, who is constantly moving in all constituencies for supervising poll preparations. He refuted opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala’s bogus voter claim. “All such cases that were flagged in Trikaripur and Kasaragod are from Congress strongholds. CPM won’t need a single duplicate or bogus vote to win there,” he added. In this scenario, BJP is focused on deprivation of basic amenities here. “My focus is only on development issues and not political accusations,” said BJP candidate Shibin TV.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/for-udf-bjp-trikaripur-would-be-an-uphill-task/articleshow/81676792.cms||KP Saikiran

The board of governors at GTU took this decision at a meeting held recently. GTU has 550 affiliated colleges. The varsity released a circular in this connection on Wednesday. In the case of diploma studies, students were required to complete the programme within six years while it was eight years in the case of degree studies. “The new education policy has provisions for candidates to re-enter a programme at any point of time after they quit. Even if a student quit the programme many years ago and wished to rejoin, s/he can do so at any time,” said GTU sources. Such candidates can resume studies after payment of fees of Rs 5,000, according to sources. The decision is likely to give a new lease of life to several hundred students who left their studies incomplete in the past due to varied reasons, sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gtu-degree-dropouts-can-resume-studies-midway/articleshow/81676781.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Charges fake, quash Mohan Delkar case FIR: Collector||MUMBAI: The collector of Dadra and Nagar Haveli has moved the Bombay high court to quash and set aside the FIR registered against him in the suicide of MP Mohan Delkar. Sandeep Kumar Singh is named in the FIR lodged by Delkar’s son, Abhinav, and charged mainly with abetment with eight others. On February 22, Delkar was found dead in a hotel room here. Singh’s petition said the FIR was “belatedly” registered on March 9 by the Marine Drive police station. He said the allegations against him were “baseless and false” and said there was no specific allegation by Delkar except that on August 2, or Liberation Day, he was insulted when Singh did not allow him to deliver a speech. Singh said the only action ever taken by him concerning Delkar was on the SSR Trust he chaired . Singh’s office had got a letter from the PMO about several complaints that the trust had encroached on government lands. After an inquiry and a notice under the Land Revenue Code, an eviction notice was issued, which was challenged in the high court. Arbitration proceedings are pending, said his petition. On Wednesday, before a bench of Justice S S Shinde and Justice Manish Pitale, senior advocate Amit Desai with advocate Sunny Bhimra, appearing for Singh, said the FIR was “politically motivated” as the entire administration, from the administrator, collector and others, was named in it. Desai referred to former police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s letter to the CM which stated that though the FIR ought to have been lodged in Dadra and Nagar Haveli as the alleged acts of abetment had taken place there, home minister Anil Deshmukh had insisted on its registration in the city. “The allegations against the collector do not constitute any offence,” said Desai. Prosecutor Vithal Konde-Deshmukh sought time to take instructions. The judges posted the hearing on Thursday and directed that till then “no coercive steps” be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/collector-charges-fake-quash-delkar-case-fir-in-mumbai/articleshow/81676809.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Nagpur||Nimgade murder: NCP wants SIT to probe Fadnavis role||Nagpur: Alleging complicity of Devendra Fadnavis in the murder of city architect Eknath Nimgade, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Wednesday demanded special investigation team (SIT) to probe the former CM’s role.NCP workers, led by former corporator Vedprakash Arya, Shailesh Pande and Shailendra Tiwari, NCP youth wing president, protested outside Dharampeth residence of Fadnavis, who is now leader of opposition in the state assembly, and burned his effigy.Reacting to NCP’s demand, city BJP president Pravin Datke said they (NCP-Congress-Shiv Sena) are running Maharashtra government and BJP is ready for any inquiry.Citing allegations by city lawyer Satish Uke, Arya said Nimgade had 57 acre land worth Rs300 crore near Nagpur airport. “Uke has claimed that in 2016, Fadnavis and his PA Kumar Masram had asked Nimgade to hand over the land as they were interested in constructing a mall at the spot,” said Arya. Uke alleged that Nimgade was murdered as he refused to part with the land, Arya claimed. “Nimgade’s sons too had alleged Fadnavis’s involvement in the murder. Yet, neither Maharashtra police nor CBI took any cognizance,” said the NCP leader.Sitabuldi police, led by senior PI Atul Sabnis, detained 11 NCP workers including Arya and Pande for holding the demonstration without permission. “The NCP workers have been booked under relevant sections of the IPC and under various provisions of the Epidemic Act,” said Sabnis. A war of words has erupted between BJP and NCP after the former demanded resignation of Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh over his alleged Rs100 crore per month extortion bid as claimed by former Mumbai commissioner of police Param Bir Singh. On Monday, BJP workers had protested against Deshmukh, while Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) activists had burned effigy of the home minister in front of his Civil Lines residence. Datke also claimed that Nagpur city police are treating BJYM activists like criminals after they blocked the convoy of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar near Amravati Road last month demanding electricity bill waiver for consumers.“The activists were demanding relief for consumers, but the city police clicked their photos holding slate having their name as is done with criminals.” A BJP delegation met commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar on the issue, he said.On the other hand, NCP workers pointed out that many ministers in the Fadnavis cabinet were accused of corruption, but then chief minister had not sought their resignation. “How can he (Fadnavis) seek resignation of home minister Anil Deshmukh over just an allegation,” asked Pande.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nimgade-murder-ncp-wants-sit-to-probe-fadnavis-role/articleshow/81676806.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The girl was diagnosed with primary biliary cirrhosis leading to end-stage liver disease. “In the girl’s case, her mother came forward and donated part of her healthy liver, paving way for an early transplant. Otherwise, organ donation is a time-consuming process. We planned for a living donor liver transplant using our advanced robot-assisted technology to ensure accuracy and faster recovery of the donor,” ABMH’s liver transplant surgeon Sharan Narute said. The surgery lasted for six-and-a-half hours. The donor had an excellent recovery and was sent home after three days of the surgery. The girl also responded well and was discharged home on the seventh day after the surgery. Rekha Dubey, chief executive officer, ABMH, said, “This is the first-of-its-kind robotic living donor liver transplant surgery in the Western part of India carried out on a paediatric patient.” The girl’s mother said, “She is feeling better and all her health issues have resolved post-transplant surgery.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/docs-successfully-perform-robot-assisted-living-donor-liver-transplant/articleshow/81676803.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Writing on the wall: Messages for netas replace poll slogans in Khwabgaon||Kolkata: A tiny hamlet with 17 tribal families in the forests of Jhargram in Jangalmahal has “walled up” the facades of their mud homes. No space has been left to write poll slogans on the outside of the houses as villagers have already painted them with colourful murals, depicting the daily joys and struggles of the rural life, safety measures against Covid-19 and even stories from mythology. “Since 2018, when we started painting murals on the walls, political workers have stopped coming here because there is no space for political graffiti,” said Bhopi Malla, a resident of Lalbazar, situated in a forest almost 25 km from Jhargram town. Lalbazar, or Khwabgaon—Hamlet of Dreams—is inhabited by Lodha and Sabar families, one of the most backward and deprived communities in the state. But what they have done can be an inspiration for homeowners across the state. Property owners have a tough time ahead of every election, as workers from all parties take over their walls to paint graffiti of party symbols, messages and slogans. In Khwabgaon, on the other hand, the villagers did not allow the workers the opportunity to paint graffiti on their walls. Instead, they painted them with colourful motifs and some even had messages for politicians and the political system, which they felt, kept them out of the mainstream and remembered them only ahead of polls. Most of them daily wage earners, the villagers pointed out the walls of their modest homes were a canvas for their children, where they gave shape to their interpretations of their surroundings, thoughts and their dreams. “Normally, politicians use walls to make promises, which they never fulfil. In our village, we use the walls to tell the politicians the life and the world we want to stay in,” said a villager. Perhaps because these murals are painted by the people of the forest, multiple murals depict the man-animal relationship. Some have painted numerous smiling faces of girls, possibly wishing for a safe and secured environment for them. The paintings of children playing merrily can be depicted as a wish for a healthy life for the children in rural areas.“Painter Mrinal Mandal visited our village a few years ago and suggested that we should start painting on the walls of the huts. Two painters started helping us learn the art. Today, our children paint the walls after every few months,” said Malla. The children have even converted a wall into a message board for Covid-19 safety protocol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/writing-on-the-wall-messages-for-netas-replace-poll-slogans-in-khwabgaon/articleshow/81676817.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Instead, the custodians of democracy disgraced the state.The visuals that emerged on Wednesday can’t belie the truth and certainly don't augur well for democracy. The scenes of the legislators laying siege to the Speaker’s chair in the House, holding him captive in his chamber amid unprecedented chaos on the floor, and marshals and riot police lifting, dragging and even beating some of the MLAs did not mirror the democratic values the elected members were supposed to stand for. Only time will tell if it is the beginning of a new era of democracy in Bihar, damn caring for rules, proceedings and public perception about them.“Unacceptable,” says Prof Prabhat P Ghosh, member secretary, Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI). “The issue (Bihar Special Armed Police Bill) and the circumstances were not so contentious to go to that extreme. In any case, such activities cannot be approved. What happened was without any serious provocation. It was unfortunate," Ghosh told TOI, adding, “Whatever happened indicates lack of order in the proceedings of the assembly.” When asked further about the controversial issue, he said any such Bill is not desirable in a civilised society. “In the Indian context, giving the police power to arrest without a warrant may be misused for political purposes and will lose its credibility,” he said.Former Patna College principal Prof Nawal Kishore Chaudhary feels the Tuesday incidents brought shame to Bihar. “Are we headed to jungle raj where chaos and anarchy rule? Yeh loktantra nahi bheedtantra hai jahan jiski takat hogi wahi bolega or manmarji karega (It's like mobocracy where only the mighty speak and act on whims). In a democracy, there are rules and systems to debate and decide any issue by number in a dignified manner. Those who indulged in such activities on Tuesday damn care for democratic values. A sad day, indeed!” Prof Chaudhary said.Deploring the incidents further, he said, “Virodh ka matlab nahi ki pathar mar dein, Speaker ko bandhak bana lein. (Opposition does not mean pelting stones and holding the Speaker hostage). Who is responsible for creating such situations where riot police had to be called inside the House? There are ways of peaceful protests and agitation in a democracy. We are headed to chaos and anarchy by destroying the fundamentals of democracy. This is what we are teaching our students? Let better sense prevail,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/power-to-arrest-without-warrant-may-be-misused/articleshow/81676840.cms||Jai Narain Pandey

These recruitments were made in the absence of vacant positions, according to the department. It has issued a circular in this regard to all universities where it has warned of strict disciplinary action against any official who does not adhere to this directive. “It has come to light that several academic and non-academic staff members were recruited in the absence of any such vacant posts in the past few years,” said sources in the education department. Also, the salary, allowances, and even promotions with hike in payscale were given to these new recruits, sources added. All this has been done in gross violation of the state education department’s guidelines, according to sources. The funds generated after cancellation of these recruitments should immediately be directed to the grants received by the university.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-directs-varsities-to-cancel-all-irregular-appointments/articleshow/81676802.cms||---

In the 2019 by-poll when UDF's TJ Vinod won by mere 3570 votes, KM Manu, the namesake candidate of LDF-backed independent candidate Manu Roy had secured 2,572 votes. Shaji George’s namesake candidate is also named Shaji George. To reduce the potential impact, the LDF-independent candidate has changed his electoral name to Shaji George Pranatha adding his publishing company's name as a suffix. The LDF leaders said that each vote is valuable this time as the LDF aims to secure victory in the UDF bastion. The LDF has strengthened its campaign to create awareness about the namesake through social media and asked the workers to tell voters to be mindful of it in the polling booth. “The UDF knows that they could not cleanly win the election this time. They want to fool and cheat voters by fielding namesakes. In the last by-polls, the namesake affected the vote share of the LDF and it should not happen. The namesake candidate Shaji George is a congress leader from Piravom and he has not even appeared anywhere in the constituency for the campaign. It is very clear the UDF uses him to steal LDF votes in Ernakulam,” said a CPM area committee member in Ernakulam. Shaji George said that adding the name of his publishing company will help him to be more familiar among the voters. “The voting machine will feature my name as Shaji George Pranatha,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ldf-candidate-in-ekm-adds-a-suffix-to-tackle-namesake/articleshow/81676823.cms||---
---||Pune||International cabaret goes online with stories of love, loss and loneliness||PUNE: The Q Theatre Productions (QTP), which organises the Thespo Youth Theatre Festival, has teamed up with two Canadian theatre movements and a pioneering South African actor to bring together an online cabaret show that will not only feature sensuous song and dance, but also some elements of pathos brought on by the pandemic. The live and recorded performances will be held on Saturday evening and Sunday morning, which will be streamed on Twitch, the gaming livestream platform, with 12 performers from India and Canada scheduled to perform. The event is being supported by Canada’s consulate-general in Mumbai, the organisers said. Tsholo Visions Khalema, an actor and a self-taught filmmaker, who is a transgender man born in apartheid South Africa, but is now based in Canada, is the facilitator of the entire event. Cabaret performances have been traditionally associated with bold and sensual experiences, performed at hotels and casinos, and includes theatrical performances, with dollops of song and dance, monologues, mime, drag, burlesque, and elements such as commedia dell’arte. In the show, titled Cosmocabaret, traditional elements will be incorporated in the performances, while engaging in a cultural exchange. There will be stories of love, loss, loneliness, all magnified over a year of quarantine and disease. “The two Canadian theatre movements -- Paprika Theatre Festival, and Social Distancing Festival -- have similar aims as ours, which is to find and mentor emerging artists in the theatre space. The performances on Saturday and Sunday will have 12 such emerging artists, and they will incorporate a lot of traditional cabaret elements in their acts. Since it is an event across two countries and two time zones, this will also be a cultural exchange, which is why the event is titled that way. One of the performers will sing a thumri as part of the act,” said Anushka Ghose, one of the organisers of the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/international-cabaret-goes-online-with-stories-of-love-loss-and-loneliness/articleshow/81676826.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Nagpur||Medical colleges lagging in Covid treatment despite 1,000-bed claims||Nagpur: The contribution of government medical colleges in the fight against Covid seems to have gone down though they had assured the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court to increase their bed strength by over 1,000 during a sou motu PIL hearing last year. Hence, it is not surprising the city is facing acute shortage of beds for Covid patients despite having three medical colleges GMCH, IGGMCH and AIIMS which have already gain considerable experience in treating Covid patients. The three hospitals have so far treated 1,345 (discharged patients) from March 1 to 23 when the daily cases have topped September 2020 which was peak of second wave. It was 2,565 patients from August 31 to September 29 even though cases had began falling from late September. On Wednesday evening, the situation again turned chaotic with beds becoming unavailable though NMC data showed 608 beds vacant. GMCH dean Dr Sajal Mitra, IGGMCH medical superintendent Dr Ravi Chauhan and his deputy medical superintendent Dr Sagar Pandey, who were at the forefront of the Covid fight, are also missing from action due to different reasons. GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande too went on leave at this critical juncture. Their absence at the helm has affected the Covid management to a large extent at the medical colleges. AIIMS was expected to come up with 500 beds by December which too has not been achieved. Though the NMC and district administrations had ordered the medical colleges to make all beds available at their respective hospitals, it is not clear why GMCH and IGGMCH stopped taking patients at just 50% occupancy of their total bed strength. In previous wave too, the medical colleges had submitted in the court that more beds would be available. A spokesperson from AIIMS Nagpur said, “Despite not having a dedicated functioning IPD, the Institute designated a special floor in the OPD block, and constructed a well-functioning 60 bedded Covid Isolation ward with 6 bedded ICU from scratch, and has successfully treated more than 1,500 patients since its inception. The much-needed construction of the IPD block that was planned to hold the remaining planned Covid isolation wards is underway despite various limitations brought by the pandemic.” IGGMCH spokesperson said not many had to return on Wednesday though some issues persists. “Dr Chauhan has returned and Dr Pandey is assisting the dean over phone. We have reached 480 to 500 beds now. We are getting more manpower. 85 admissions were done today,” the spokesperson said. Besides AIIMS, GMCH was also directed to set up 400 additional beds in November last year. “We are starting 300 beds in addition to 600 Covid beds in next 15 days. Half of these will be started in next couple of days. Technical issues had held up the 400 beds. We are facing staff scarcity of doctors, and nurses. Some doctors are working continuously on Covid duties,” said GMCH officials. At the start of the second wave, GMCH and IGGMCH had committed 600 beds each. This was not the first time incorrect bed availabity was shown.

---||Hyderabad||Tractors and farm tools just a phone call away for ryots||Hyderabad: Modelled on the lines of Uber cab services, the Telangana government has decided to provide tractors and other agriculture implements (tools) to farmers in the rural areas. Agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy said the farmers can make a phone call and get whatever they want in what he called Uberisation of agriculture. He said under the Uberisation concept, if a farmer needs a tractor and other tools for his farm, he can call those who provide them in his village or surrounding villages and they would be provided immediately. He said the government has decided to encourage farm mechanisation to overcome the problems of agriculture labour scarcity in the state. “Every year, the state requires an estimated 71 lakh hours for various agriculture works, but there is a scarcity of 16 lakh hours. Farm labourers from Chhattisgarh and other states come to Telangana for agriculture-related works,” Niranjan Reddy told members during the question hour in the assembly on Wednesday. To bridge the gap between the availability of workers and the demand, the government has decided to encourage farm mechanisation with a target of 95 per cent in agriculture works from the existing 45 per cent, the minister said. As of now, the government is providing agriculture tools and machines such as harvesters and innovators with 50% subsidy. “In 2020-21, over 6.60 lakh farmers got subsidy and the government had spent Rs 951 crore on farm mechanisation. This year, the government has allocated Rs 1,500 crore on farm mechanisation,” Niranjan Reddy said. He said the cultivable land has gone up, while some of the agriculture labourers had shifted to other occupations. “In the next four years, we may not find a girl sowing in an agriculture field in the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tractors-and-farm-tools-just-a-phone-call-away-for-ryots/articleshow/81676811.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Delhi||30 contacts of every person found positive to be traced||New Delhi: With the capital witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases, district authorities are carrying out aggressive strategies to curb the spread, which include tracing and testing at least 30 contacts of those found positive for Covid-19. “While the containment strategy has remained similar and the number of zones have gone up, we are now following the strategy of tracing a minimum of 30 contacts of those who test positive. Earlier, this number was around 20, but it was then increased,” an official from the south district said. He added that stress is also on vaccination of identified beneficiaries and the district machinery is trying to mobilise as many of the beneficiaries for inoculation as possible. “The North West district is conducting aound 5,000 RT-PCR tests in a day. We have increased the testing as we are doing ‘line listing’ of a lot of contacts and are getting them mandatorily tested,” Cheshta Yadav, district magistrate (north west) said. “The numbers have gone up from the 20-25 contacts earlier and now more contacts are being traced,” she added. Line listing is an organised and detailed list of cases with individual records that help in keeping track of multiple individuals at one place, particularly during an outbreak. Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Khirwar had recently issued an order asking all district magistrates to intensify surveillance efforts and boost Covid awareness in ‘super spreader’ areas like weekly markets, cinema halls, shopping malls, places of worship and Delhi Metro trains. Random testing of passengers arriving at railway stations and inter-state bus terminals (ISBT) — from states where Covid-19 cases are surging — has also been intensified. Shahdara district authorities started random testing of passengers arriving at Anand Vihar disembarking from buses near the Uttar Pradesh-Delhi border earlier last year, even before the ISBT reopened. The testing has been further intensified now, along with ISBTs at Kashmere Gate and Sarai Kale Khan. Yadav said surveillance of patients in home isolation is also being done thoroughly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/30-contacts-of-every-person-found-positive-to-be-traced/articleshow/81696207.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt to set up coaching institutes||GANDHINAGAR: The state government will set up special coaching institutes to prepare youth for competitive examinations, chief minister Vijay Rupani said this in the assembly on Wednesday. Speaking on a discussion on coaching for students of scheduled tribes during question hour in the assembly, the CM said, “The state government will introduce a new scheme to begin coaching centres for students who aspire to get admission into institutes like IIMs and IITs,” the CM said. He added that the government has already contacted reputed coaching centres based in Kota, Rajasthan. “The state government will open coaching centres in big cities like Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, and Rajkot. The state government will conduct tests to admit students in these coaching centres. Our aim is to ensure that more students from Gujarat do well in competitive examinations like NEET, JEE and others, and eventually get admission in reputed institutions like IIMs and IITs,” the CM said in the assembly. However, existing coaching classes which train students for competitive examinations, appeared to be skeptical about the idea. Requesting anonymity, the proprietor of a leading coaching institute said that teachers are paid about Rs 25 lakh annually for their services. “When the government has not been able to pay salaries of regular teachers, paying high salaries to coaching teachers will be difficult,” the proprietor pointed out. Another coaching institute proprietor said that there has been a saturation of institutes in Kota, and they have been branching out in other parts of the country of late. “Curriculum and syllabus of all competitive exams for which the government aims to prepare youth are already being taught in private institutes,” the proprietor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-to-set-up-coaching-institutes/articleshow/81676834.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Covid -negative certificate required to attend Kumbh Mela: Uttarakhand High Court||NAINITAL: Days after chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat made the statement that no RT-PCR test report is required to attend Kumbh Mela, the Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday directed the state to strictly adhere to the the SOPs issued by both the central and state governments and “implement the guidelines in both letter and spirit.” The order effectively makes the Covid-19 RT-PCR test report mandatory, thereby clearing up the confusion that was prevailing in this regard especially after the CM’s statement made soon after he took over earlier this month. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma which delivered the order said that “the government must insist that no pilgrim is allowed to enter Kumbh Mela areas or to enter the state, until and unless the person carries a medical certificate clearly indicating that he/she is not a Covid-19-positive patient.” The bench noted that Covid cases are rising in several parts of the country which has forced several states to go into partial lockdown as a result of which, the pandemic remains a cause of concern. “This is a clear indication that we are again entering the phase where the country will face the Covid-19 pandemic.Therefore, the state government is expected to be vigilant and to ensure that the Maha Kumbh mela does not turn into a breeding ground for the spread of Covid-19. Therefore, this court directs the state government to ensure that the SOPs issued by the central and state government are implemented in the strictest sense, both in letter and spirit,” read the court order. Meanwhile the inspection report presented by Shiv Bhatt, counsel appearing for one of the petitioners who has filed Public Interest Litigations (PILs) concerning the state’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, was also presented before the court on Wednesday. While the report, a copy of which is available with TOI, praised some of the works done — especially in Haridwar’s Har-ki-Pauri ghat — it also revealed that several important infrastructure projects are still incomplete. “There are no proper toilet facilities at several ghats and men were also seen taking pictures and videos of bathing women. Further there is a significant lack of toilets while ghats like the one at Tapovan are in shambolic states. Most of the roads leading up to them are also in a pathetic state,” Bhatt told TOI. The HC has now directed the chief secretary as well as secretary (health) to visit Haridwar to ensure that civil as well as medical works still pending are completed on time. “The chief secretary said that he will personally be in Haridwar for three days to ensure all the works are completed on time. The court has further said that enough women and male police personnel should be stationed at the ghats,” Bhatt said. Meanwhile, chief secretary Om Prakash told mediapersons after the HC recorded his statement saying that the Centre’s SOPs will be strictly followed for Maha Kumbh, “We are going to enforce the high court’s order. A Covid-19 negative RT-PCR report, of a test done within 72 hours, or a vaccination report, will be mandatory for attending the Kumbh mela in Haridwar,” he said. On Sunday, the union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan had written a strongly-worded letter to the CS, highlighting the need for stringent measures to control the spread of coronavirus during Kumbh Mela, saying a central team during its visit to Uttarakhand had found that 10 to 20 pilgrims and as many locals were testing positive for the virus everyday. In the letter, Bhushan had warned that there was potential of an upsurge in Covid cases in the local population after shahi snan days (April 12, April 14 and April 27) in Kumbh Mela.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||In CPM, MVR now prevails over EMS||In the 1984 parliament elections, late Congress leader K Karunakaran decided to go for an experiment in Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha constituency. He decided to pitch A Charles, a member of the Nadar community with no political background, against A Neelalohithadasa Nadar of LDF. To everyone's surprise, Charles won. What turned out to be the biggest embarrassment for LDF, especially for CPM supremo EMS Namboodiripad, was not the failure of its candidate but the fact that Kerala Varma Raja who contested under the banner of Hindu Munnani secured 19.80% of the polled votes. “EMS was very shocked that Hindu Munnani candidate got so many votes. In the erstwhile Thiruvananthapuram East assembly constituency, a section of which is now part of Nemom, Rama Varma Raja came second pushing Neelalohithadasa Nadar to third position. The main campaigner for Raja’s election was none other than Kummanam Rajasekharan,” recalls Jacob George, political observer. By then, Rajasekharan had attracted attention through his key role in the Nilackal protests against a Christian sect setting up a church close to Sabarimala. But more importantly, the Nemom result set in motion a chain of extremely significant events within CPM. “EMS was upset with the increased vote share of Hindu Munnani candidate. He found that it was the growth of Muslim communalism promoted by certain political parties that became the catalyst for the growth of Hindu communalism", says Jacob. EMS argued that no communal parties should be there in LDF. But, CPM strongman MV Raghavan stood for expanding the LDF by including Kerala Congress (M) and Muslim League. MVR presented an alternative policy document at the state conference demanding that both parties be included in the LDF fold. But, EMS made an emotional speech at the meeting and the alternative policy was voted out. Later, this rift grew subsequently leading to the expulsion of Raghavan from CPM. More than three decades later when Rajasekharan contests from Nemom, Muraleedharan, son of K Karunakaran, has been roped in as the UDF candidate. The election to the constituency has become a prestige issue for all three fronts. In 2016, BJP candidate from Nemom K Rajagopal sprung a surprise by opening an account for the party in the assembly. “BJP’s increasing mass base has instilled a sense of insecurity in the minds of secular people as well as minorities. So, both LDF and UDF have to woo the secular voters and minorities,” said N M Pearson, political observer. “The Congress was fast to sense the damage and give a message that the party is the one which is at the forefront of the fight against BJP. The hype regarding Congress fielding a mighty candidate against BJP in Nemom made the constituency a symbol of the political fight in the whole state,” Pearson said. After more than three decades, as Nemom once again hogs the spotlight, the political alignments reveal that EMS's original ideological position has been reversed. Kerala Congress (M), which EMS wanted to be kept away, joined LDF. Indian National League with which LDF had been making electoral understanding in the past several years joined the LDF fold. RSP joined UDF by snapping ties with left parties and Loktantrik Janata Dal which had switched over to UDF rejoined LDF. “Now power has replaced all political values. All parties now claim that we are less corrupt or less communal compared to others. There is only quantitative difference not any qualitative distinction,” said J Prabhash, political analyst.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/in-cpm-mvr-now-prevails-over-ems/articleshow/81676849.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Ahmedabad||A murder, an attempt every 5 days in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: One murder and one attempted murder takes place every five days in Ahmedabad. In the past five years, between October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2020, the city reported 371 incidents of murder and 395 incidents of attempt to murder. This was revealed in the data tabled in the state assembly on Wednesday. The highest number of murder and attempted murder cases were reported from Surat city. While Ahmedabad recorded the second highest incidents of murder and attempted murder in the past five years, the city had the highest incidents (119) of attempted murder in 2019-20 followed by 79 cases in Surat. The official data was tabled in the assembly in response to questions raised by Congress MLA Shailesh Parmar. The data reveals that number of murders was the lowest in 2019-20 since 2015-16 (October 1 to September 30). The officials said that in 2019-20, there were 60 murders — a decline of 18% as compared to 2018-19 during the same period. However, attempted murder cases rose to 112 in 2019-20 compared to 98 attempted murder cases in 2018-19. The data also revealed that a total of 967 accused have been arrested and only 13 accused were yet to be arrested. Also, in the cases of attempt to murder, the city police has arrested 1,196 accused while 23 were absconding. A senior police officer who asked not to be identified said the arrests of 36 accused in over 700 incidents of murder and attempted murder were pending as they may have left the state. The officer said that the number of murders was less due to lockdown as people stayed indoors, while the police patrolled the roads. “With people confined at homes, the chances of major dispute reduced. However, disputes with neighbours increased. This led to minor scuffles. The intervention of other neighbours helped prevent major incidents from occurring,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/a-murder-an-attempt-every-5-days-in-city/articleshow/81676839.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Parties in case were ‘hunky dory,’ says SC on Param Bir Singh plea||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked Param Bir Singh to approach the Bombay high court. Referring to allegations levelled by the cop and the minister against each other, an SC bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and R Subhash Reddy said it seems that parties in the case were “hunky dory” for a long time, but they started making allegations and counter-allegations as a consequence of their falling out. Singh has accused Deshmukh of asking disgraced encounter cop Sachin Waze, currently in NIA custody, to raise Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai. “We have no doubt that the matter is quite serious and affects the administration at large. It also appears that a lot of material which has come in public domain is a consequence of the personas falling out,” the court said. The bench asked senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi why his client approached the apex court directly and suggested that Singh knock at the doors of the Bombay high court. The court also pointed out that the minister against whom allegations had been levelled was not made a party. Rohatgi replied it was a mistake and said he is willing to forthwith implead Anil Deshmukh as respondent. “If investigation by an independent agency is being sought for, that is a relief which can also be granted by the high court. There have also been subsequent developments in the matter, as has been noticed in terms of the report of Ms Rashmi Shukla, commissioner, state intelligence department. The high court has the requisite authority to address the same,” the bench said. Rohatgi thereafter agreed to withdraw the petition and told the court that he will file it in the HC. As the petitioner referred to the apex court’s verdict on police reforms to impress upon the court to intervene to protect him, the bench expressed concern that its verdict had not been followed by states and the issue always cropped up when a controversy, like the present one, erupted in the public glare. “In our view, this is only a mantra recited periodically, wherever the occasion so suits, and there has been no seriousness by all concerned to ever implement the directions enshrined in the judgment. These directions were based on the principle of insulating police machinery from political/executive interference to make it more efficient and to strengthen the rule of law. It appears that none want to give up, inter alia, the control of police transfers or implement measures that would insulate the police machinery from performing its role without any uncalled for interference,” the bench said in its order. Singh, a 1988 batch IPS officer, sought a comprehensive CBI probe into the home minister’s numerous acts of alleged corruption and criminality. He also claimed he was transferred out immediately after he briefed CM Uddhav Thackeray about Deshmukh’s alleged activities. Singh challenged Deshmukh on his statement to media that he was transferred to facilitate a fair probe into the explosives-laden vehicle found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence Antilia. He said it was a red herring as there was not even a murmur that he had impeded the probe into the sensational incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/parties-in-case-were-hunky-dory-says-sc-on-singh-plea/articleshow/81676857.cms||---

The Uttamnagar police arrested them for celebrating their release from the Yerawada central jail on Tuesday afternoon after a large number of people assembled illegally at Shivane in the Uttamnagar area. The police said the five men were arrested three months ago for their alleged involvement in an-attempt-to-murder case. The five arrested men were identified as Sagar Bhagwat Warkari (21), Avinash Rampratap Gupta (20), Akash Sibban Goud (19), Sagar Rajendra Goud (19) and his brother, Suraj Rajendra Goud (24), all residents of Shivane. After their police custody lapsed in the murder bid case, they were remanded in magisterial custody in the prison. Sub-inspector Prakash Jagtap of the Uttamnagar police said the five men were released from the Yerawada jail on Tuesday morning on bail. Their supporters, about six, gathered near the Rahulnagar bus stop area around 1.30 pm. They busted firecrackers and shouted slogans. They also hurled abuses at the residents. The police said they terrorised the residents of the area, compelling them to shut the doors and windows of their houses. One among them made an emergency call to the police. The five suspects’ supporters ran away after spotting the police vans in the area. The five men were arrested again on the charges of unlawful assembly, disobeying the orders promulgated by the public servants, rioting and spreading infectious diseases. The Pune city police are keeping a close eye on the criminals after their release from prisons following the show of strength by the city-based gangster, Gajanan alias Gaja Marne. He had travelled to Pune city in a cavalcade of 500 vehicles from Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai on February 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/post-release-celebrations-land-5-prisoners-back-in-jail/articleshow/81676852.cms||---
---||Mumbai||MVA orders judicial probe into ‘letter bomb’, seeks report on phone tapping||MUMBAI: The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government on Wednesday night decided to conduct a judicial probe under the Commission of Inquiry Act into former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s ‘letter bomb’. CM Thackeray also asked chief secretary Sitaram Kunte to submit a comprehensive report on the phone-tapping in the alleged police transfers case when IPS officer Rashmi Shukla was state intelligence commissioner. “The cabinet took note of Singh’s letter as well as the outcome of the Supreme Court proceedings. It was decided that it would be appropriate if a judicial commission is set up under the Commission of Inquiry Act to probe into all aspects of the ‘letter bomb’. A retired Bombay high court judge will be appointed to conduct the inquiry,” a senior NCP minister told TOI. Welcoming the decision, home minister Anil Deshmukh said: “It was my demand that all charges should be probed. The CM has accepted our proposal.” A day after his unceremonious exit, Singh had written a strongly worded letter to Thackeray alleging that Deshmukh had asked arrested API Sachin Waze to mobilise Rs 100 crore per month from establishments. Singh had mentioned that the issues were brought to the notice of the CM, his deputy, and NCP president Sharad Pawar, but no action was taken. Earlier in the day, during a discussion in the cabinet, ministers called for action against Shukla for illegally intercepting communication and breach of privacy. “There was a row over whether Shukla had obtained permission of the competent authority before tapping phones. It was alleged that some phones were tapped without authority. So, the CM has asked Kunte, who was then the additional chief secretary (home) to submit the report as early as possible. We were expecting the report tonight, but it appears that he will submit it on Thursday,” the NCP minister said. Pointing out that phones can be tapped only under guidelines issued by the Centre, NCP minister Jitendra Awhad said: “The reasons given by Shukla were not in line with these guidelines. She sought permission to tap one person’s phone, but was tapping many people’s phones.” Earlier in the day, state Congress president Nana Patole sought a high-level probe under the Commission of Inquiry Act in the Waze episode and Singh’s allegations. “Had I been the head of the administration, instead of shifting Singh, I would have suspended him for exceeding his brief.” (Inputs by Bhavika Jain)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mva-orders-judicial-probe-into-letter-bomb-seeks-report-on-phone-tapping/articleshow/81677066.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Kunal Mourya, executive member, TogetherWeCan, said till March 22 GMCH’s daily bed chart showed 518 . “On Wednesday morning, 529 beds were shown and it was only in the second half it went up to 582. Still there was difference of 36 beds. It has to be around 618 or 608 in case they consider 518 as last position,” he said. Mourya added that the 36 beds is a huge number in the present circumstances. GMCH officials said the 90 beds were equally divided for male and female and almost all are full. “We are not denying there was admission problem. We are thankful to the court that it allowed us to run the 90 beds. All wait list has been cleared. It may be a human error that incorrect (if any) figures have been shown on the chart,” said a top officer. The officer said till 2pm on Tuesday the situation was manageable but suddenly at 3pm it turned disastrous. “We only followed SOP and moved application through the dean to collector. The collector sir said we must inform the court at night only and it agreed,” he said. The officer said the basement wards were reconstructed only five days back, when asked why GMCH was waiting for court order. “It is not that 90 beds were lying idle. The situation was also not as bad 5 days back as it was,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/90-beds-added-but-gmch-bed-strength-goes-up-by-only-54/articleshow/81676869.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Delhi||Delhi Police: When PPE kits replaced lathis, guns||NEW DELHI: The pandemic was an unprecedented challenge for Delhi Police that had no worthwhile knowledge about dealing with such a crisis. However, the lockdown not only brought about a paradigm shift in police’s functioning, but also gave them an opportunity to strengthen ties with the public. On the first anniversary of the lockdown, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava on Wednesday explained how he undertook metropolitan policing while spearheading a force that was at the forefront of fighting the pandemic along with healthcare personnel. “Enforcing the lockdown threw many challenges as Delhi has many activities that cannot be abruptly halted. It was necessary to reach out to police personnel on the ground and explain to them how to deal with the new situation with a positive frame of mind,” Shrivastava told TOI. Union home minister Amit Shah had made it clear that the lockdown would only be successful if it was implemented in a humane manner and people were made partners to achieve the objective. According to Shrivastava, police’s first task was ensuring that there was no panic among people and they could have unhindered supply of food, medicines and other essential amenities. “Besides providing food to the underprivileged, ensuring supply of essential commodities, emergency movement of people for medical purposes, addressing needs of senior citizens and taking care of stray animals were other concerns,” added Shrivastava. By March 27, 2020, all districts had started running community kitchens, the first being Najafgarh police station where cops and women cooked and gave food to the poor in the nearby colonies twice a day during the entire lockdown period. More than 1.2 crore food packets were distributed with the help of Good Samaritans. The police families welfare societies distributed special packets that not only contained food, but also essential commodities like sanitiser, soap and masks. “We came up with movement passes to help those who had no option but to step out. Simultaneously, a helpline was launched to inform people about the restrictions and relaxations, movement passes, etc. We were the first police force to start such a helpline in the country,” said the top cop. PCR vans became a pillar of strength for the public. While 997 women in labour were rushed to hospital, nine deliveries took place in the vans. Around 300 cops donated plasma in association with AIIMS by November 2020. Manning containment zones was another major challenge and lathis were replaced with PPE kits. Beat cops, who were flooded with SOS calls from the elderly seeking medicines and other essentials, acted on every such call promptly. Even non-residents who needed medicines were helped out. A person residing in Uttar Pradesh's Bahraich district requested South district police to provide medicines to his grandfather who suffered from heart disease. The medicine was available only in south Delhi. Police procured the medicines and got them delivered. The movement of migrant labourers was a tricky situation and police had to be careful not to be tough while handling large crowds at the borders. In the past year, Delhi Police lost 34 of its own, while 7,733 cops have tested positive for the virus till now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/when-ppe-kits-replaced-lathis-guns/articleshow/81676900.cms||Raj Shekhar

The complainant, whose husband works at Surat GIDC, filed a complaint in this regard with Vastrapur police. The investigating officer, A R Khatri, said that based on call detail records, the accused was arrested and his presence at the scene of the crime was also established. The accused has been identified as Sharda Sahay alias Suresh Yadav (29), a resident of Ramol and a native of Rajpur in UP. The woman’s boyfriend, Rakesh Pandey, is still at large. Khatri said Yadav is a security guard. Khatri said Yadav had called his brother, Nathu Yadav, who is also a security guard and lives in Satellite. This call established his presence at the scene of the crime. The woman, a resident of Surat, said she met Rakesh Pandey around a year ago. They were in a relationship when he lived in her neighbourhood. She told police that Pandey later moved to Ahmedabad and they used to meet frequently without her husband’s knowledge. On February 20, Pandey called her to meet him. When she expressed her inability, he insisted and told her to come to a residential building near Mansi Circle where they were to stay together in the security cabin. She said when she reached there, Pandey’s friend Suresh Yadav, was also there. According to the complaint, on the night of February 21, Pandey and Yadav allegedly got drunk and Yadav raped her and then Pandey. She stated that Pandey also took Rs 25,000 from her and then went incommunicado.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/security-cabin-gang-rape-1-held/articleshow/81676947.cms||---

While private schools’ bodies have welcomed the move, the parents’ bodies say that this will give a chance to the management of the schools to resort to unethical means to extract money and put burden on people who are still reeling under the economic impact of Covid-19 outbreak. “The officials of several schools are not allowing parents to pay their wards’ fees in instalments. Also, many schools are taking undue advantage of this decision and have started charging full fees from the students of Classes V and below,” said Lave Chaudhary, president of the United Parents’ Association. On the other hand, the schools’ associations have said that the decision will help them cover the financial losses that they suffered last year due to the pandemic. They further claimed that parents should pay pre-Covid-19 fee amount as the schools, especially for the above classes, are functioning normally. Meanwhile, Uttarakhand education minister Arvind Pandey held a departmental meeting with the education department officials in Dehradun on Wednesday. The minister directed officials to conduct exams to recruit teachers for Atal Utkrisht Schools. He said that the officials must focus on getting the CBSE affiliation for the Atal Utkrisht Schools while adding that those found working in an irresponsible manner will face strict action. TOI had earlier reported that the Atal Utkrisht Schools are expected to start from the upcoming academic year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/parents-protest-against-state-govt-decision-to-allow-schools-to-charge-full-fees-from-students-of-classes-vi-ix-xi/articleshow/81675886.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Kolkata||Vax solution: Longer hours, more sites||Kolkata: Expecting a rush for vaccines from April 1, when the 45-plus age group starts receiving the shot, several private hospitals have extended the working hours for their inoculation sites. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) health department, too, has decided to step up its vaccination drive with additional sites. The state will have a revised vaccination target of 3.3 crore when vaccination begins for the above 45 population next month. AMRI Hospital, which plans to scale up its daily vaccination number to 1,500 across its three units from April 1, will operate its inoculation sites seven days a week now. “Our working hours have been stretched to 8pm and we have decided to vaccinate on Sundays as well. The government has assured that there would be no dearth in the supply of vaccines,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) has extended its vaccinating hours as well. Its sites will now be open from 8am to 9pm. This is being done to ensure that the 45-plus recipients, who are busy during the working hours, get time to receive the shot either before going to work or after returning from work. “Unlike the 60-plus group, this is a working population and they will find it difficult to turn up during the morning rush hours. So, we are giving them an early morning window and the evening hours,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. He added that depending on the crowd, the vaccination hours could be extended further. At Peerless Hospital, a new and bigger vaccination site has been created to meet the rush. “We are keeping this space ready to accommodate more recipients. The number will be high initially for the new group will be eager to get the jab early,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Medica is looking at ‘streamlining’ its vaccination process to handle the rush. “There will be a scamper and it will be a challenge. We might have to involve more people to get things moving smoothly. But since the new group is a younger one, it should be faster and easier to handle them,” said chairperson Alok Roy. The KMC health department has also decided to scale up its vaccination drive. Currently, the civic body is running around 75 vaccination centres across 144 wards. “We have the infrastructure ready to open more vaccination centres. We may open 25 new centres at our urban primary health centres without delay. Slowly, we may need to convert more ward-wise health centres in next two months,” said a KMC health department official. A special team will be formed at every borough. It will visit areas where Covid-19 cases are on the rise. “Right now, we are concentrating on high-rises and crowded market places. Our team of trained workers are visiting door-to-door to convince citizens to visit the KMC vaccination centres without delay,” a KMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-solution-longer-hours-more-sites/articleshow/81675888.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Delhi||69 cases of UK & South Africa variants in Delhi so far||NEW DELHI: In the last six months, 69 samples of Covid-19 patients in Delhi were confirmed positive for the new coronavirus variants, namely the UK and the South Africa variants. According to a report by Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), which was formed in December last year to monitor variations in the coronavirus that causes Covid, 81 samples with mutations were of concern in the capital. Across India, the number of cases involving the established UK, South Africa and Brazil variants of SARS-CoV-2, the Covid-causing coronavirus, is respectively, 736, 34 and 1. The mutations of concern are mainly of six types and 800-900 samples have tested positive for them. “So far, no linkage has been seen between the surge in Covid cases and foreign travellers,” INSACOG has stated, adding further that the coronavisu variants detected in the community have been prevalent for six to eight months. Mutations are not uncommon in viruses, but it will be important to see whether the new mutations are significant enough to allow the virus to escape immune mechanisms and potentially effect vaccine efficacy, say experts. Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh, director, National Centre for Disease Control, said the available tests can detect Covid caused by all variants. The treatment also remains the same, he said. In Delhi, Lok Nayak Hospital has treated the maximum individual with variant-caused Covid. Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of the hospital, told TOI that most patients were asymptomatic or showed mild symptoms. “We have treated 28 patients suffering from the UK variant and one patient for the South Africa variant. Most of them had a history of foreign travel. They were kept in isolation until tests confirmed they were negative for the viral infection,” said Kumar, adding that only three patients required oxygen support. Singh stressed on the need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour to prevent the resurgence from turning into another crisis. Delhi has seen over a thousand new cases of Covid in the last three days after nearly three months. The situation in Maharashtra, Punjab and Gujarat is even more alarming. These states have also reported the presence of mutated variants of SARS-CoV-2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/69-cases-of-uk-sa-variants-in-delhi-so-far/articleshow/81676884.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Can BJP retain its fortress in Kerala?||T’puram:Political watchers, as well as voters and the three political fronts, are on tenterhooks over the eventual outcome in Nemom. As the campaign scrambles to a feverish pitch, the only sitting seat of BJP is already in the throes of a closely contested triangular electoral battle. The change in UDF camp is “quite surprising” this time, with the entry of K Muraleedharan. First time in a decade, there is a sense of euphoria. But the coalition lags behind the other two fronts in booth-level activities. At ward conventions, Muraleedharan tries to charge up the Congress workers. “My father was an MLA of this constituency for only 15 days. He opted Mala over Nemom then. Let my candidature be an atonement. I would remain with Nemom for the next five years… You stand with me till April 6. Thereafter, I will stand with you,” he says. During the campaign, Muraleedharan tries to bore holes in the development claims of LDF government. He also asks people to banish “communal” forces from Nemom. He vows that UDF is with devotees and appeals to all those who have distanced away from Congress to come back and support him in the “important” fight. He appears to be in a hurry as he runs from one meeting to another. His rivals have already made bigger strides on the campaign front. BJP’s Kummanam Rajasekharan seeks votes raising the development agenda of Narendra Modi government. He tells voters that only he can be a true successor of O Rajagopal and seeks an opportunity to carry forward the development initiated by him. According to BJP, Rajagopal had brought in developments worth Rs 400 crore in Nemom. But CPM and Congress challenge such claims. Kummanam also raises Sabarimala issue without out adding much colour to it. “I don’t believe in luck. I assure you that I would be with you for the next five years, if I win,” he quips often, adding that he won’t either destroy public property or bring shame to voters. The innuendos, the voters know, are aimed at Muraleedharan and V Sivankutty of the LDF. The BJP camp, with a well-oiled machinery at booth-levels, is working overtime to ensure that all voters who have supported the party in the assembly, parliament and local body elections are not won over by the rivals. “We are confident about Kummanam’s victory. But, this fight calls for extra vigil and grit,” says local RSS workers. They are a bit worried about how a few influential NSS Karayogams would act. The CPM has moved ahead of both BJP and Congress in campaign. The party is doubly cautious of the predicament Muraleedharan’s entry has brought in. The CPM narrative is that Congress fielded Muraleedharan to create a bogus impression in other parts of the state about its resolve to fight BJP. “Congress is not here to win. It is the LDF government that saved people in the times of Ockhi, floods, Nipah and Covid-19. Pinarayi has taken a bold stand against Citizenship Amendment Act,” Sivankutty says during the first day of his roadshow, and party supporters assembled at a junction admits that he is a fighter. There is a sort of unspoken ban on Sabarimala discussions in the LDF camp. “NSS would try to shift focus on Sabarimala. We need not to respond,” is the casual advice that local leaders give to workers as they wait for the arrival of their candidate at reception points. Both Kummanam and Muraleedharan are yet to begin their roadshows. CPM, like BJP is trying to ensure that votes that were polled in its favour, especially those of minority communities, remain with it. While BJP and CPM are trying hard to keep their votes intact, Congress is engaged in a dogged pursuit to raid both the camps searching for old pals ready for a homecoming.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/can-bjp-retain-its-fortress-in-kerala/articleshow/81676951.cms||B S Anilkumar
---||Patna||Bihar: Maheshwar Hazari elected deputy speaker amid opposition House boycott||PATNA: Four-time JD(U) MLA and former minister Maheshwar Hazari (58) was elected Deputy Speaker of Bihar Vidhan Sabha amid boycott of the House proceedings by the opposition comprising RJD, Congress, CPI-ML, CPI and CPM in protest against the use of police force against them when they were trying to block the passage of the controversial Bihar Special Armed Police Bill-2021 in the assembly on Tuesday. RJD MLA Bhudeo Chaudhary had filed nomination papers as the opposition’s nominee for the deputy speaker post. But the opposition parties did not participate in the election process. In fact, they held their “parallel House” proceedings in the lawn of the assembly building and, “unanimously” elected Bhudeo as the deputy Speaker, who conducted the mock proceedings, seated on a chair. The opposition members narrated their woes as how the district police and auxiliary force jawans manhandled and mistreated them. “If the government wants to run the House with the help of the police, then we will not participate in its proceedings. What happened on Tuesday was murder of democracy,” leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said. While congratulating Hazari, CM Nitish Kumar took a jibe at the opposition members, especially Tejashwi, for their opposition to the BSAP Bill in and outside the House. Without naming Tejashwi, Nitish wondered as to who all were advising him. “I don’t know as to what kind of thing some people are nursing inside them. Who all are advising him (read Tejashwi). They (opposition members) are not using the rights given to them by the rules of House business,” the CM said, adding they should have debated the Bill and moved the amendments. “What we have is democracy. They should participate in the process of the House,” he added. Nitish said the opposition members indulged in “undemocratic” action in the House on Tuesday. “What will they gain by doing all these things?” he asked. On Tuesday, the district police and auxiliary force jawans had bodily removed the opposition members from the assembly building for gheraoing Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha. In the process, they were also beaten up and many of them, including women members, were injured. Earlier, parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary requested the Speaker to elect the deputy speaker through voting. Nitish, being the member of the legislative council, did not participate in the voting and remained seated in his chair during the headcount. The six other MLCs who are ministers -- Ashok Choudhary, Janak Ram, Samrat Choudhary, Sanjay Kumar Jha, Santosh Suman and Mukesh Sahani – exited from the House during the voice vote and headcount. Three ruling party members – Shreyasi Singh, Subhash Singh and Speaker himself – could not cast their votes. Shreyasi and Subhash were out of the town and the Speaker casts his vote in case of a tie between the contesting candidates. Hazari, who secured 124 votes in the 243-member assembly, had served as the minister of urban development and housing as well as planning and development in the previous Nitish government. Cousin of former Union minister late Ram Vilas Paswan, Hazari also won the 2009 Lok Sabha election from Samastipur seat, defeating Ram Vilas’s brother Ram Chandra Paswan. In 2014 polls, Ram Chandra won the seat. As the BJP has won 74 seats, the post of speaker went to them. JD(U) won just 43 seats. Hence, it was given the post of deputy speaker. In the previous assembly constituted after the 2010 polls, when the JD(U) had won larger number of seats, the post of Speaker was given to its member Uday Narayan Choudhary and BJP MLA Amarendra Pratap Singh was elected the deputy speaker. After 2015 assembly polls, JD(U)’s Vijay Choudhary was made the Speaker though then the RJD had won larger number of seats among the three-party grand alliance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hazari-elected-dy-speaker-amid-oppn-house-boycott/articleshow/81676912.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Delhi||Sixth round of sero survey in Delhi likely next month||NEW DELHI: Next month, Delhi government is likely to carry out the capital’s sixth serological survey, sources said. Even though it is yet to get an official approval, it might see a small group of Delhiites who have been inoculated for Covid-19 being also tested for presence of antibodies. The fifth serological survey carried out between January 11 and 23 showed that 56.1% Delhiites have antibodies against Covid-19. With around 28,000 samples collected, including at least 100 samples from each of the 272 municipal wards, this was the biggest serological survey conducted in the country. The highest prevalence was in the South-East district, which stood at 62.2% and the least out of the 11 districts in Delhi was found in the North district, which stood at 49%. “There is no approval for the sixth serological survey yet and the sample size for the next survey has not been discussed yet. However, it is going to be carried out even though no date has been fixed yet,” a Delhi government official asserted, adding that it is quite likely to be carried out in April. “As soon as the survey is planned and finalised, written instructions will be provided to district authorities,” he said. “Right now, the planning will go on and the sample size could be slightly bigger so that one can cover a little larger population,” said Dr Suneela Garg, director professor at the department of community medicine in Maulana Azad Medical College and a public health expert who is part of the Covid-19 vaccination programme. “Basically, it will be approximately representative of the population and as the serological survey does testing only antibodies, there would be no information about different strains. For that genome sequencing is carried out and it is completely different from this survey,” she said. Dr Garg said that the results of the sixth serological survey would be a little different from the earlier surveys. “It is possible that those who had antibodies earlier, might not have that now anymore. We also don’t know about asymptomatic infection and that can also happen,” she said. The fifth serological survey was carried out at a time when vaccination against Covid-19 had just begun and Dr Garg said that a small sample size of the next survey would comprise Delhi’s population that has been inoculated. “There will be a different group one is looking at and there would be separate data of people who have been immunised,” she said, adding that the strategies for the sixth serological survey would be finalised soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sixth-round-of-sero-survey-likely-next-month/articleshow/81696289.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Senior inspector of Chikhali police station Satish Mane said that on the night of March 18, when the complainant was at his house, the woman contacted him on his cellphone. “She claimed that she was working for a job portal and offered him a better job with a prominent private company. The man believed her as she had sent him a link with the name of the job portal,” Mane said. The officer added that the man filled in his details in an online form. He was then told to pay Rs 100 for registration. “The complainant then shared the details of his debit card and later Rs 49,000 were siphoned from his account,” Mane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-duped-of-rs-49000-in-online-scam/articleshow/81675891.cms||---

Moreover, government hospitals in Gujarat have only five MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machines. The matter came up for intense discussion in the Gujarat assembly on Wednesday. Congress MLAs said that the state government has been waxing eloquent over its Covid-19control measures, but common people are having to shell out thousands of rupees for getting CT scans done at private labs, as doctors have been increasingly relying on CT scans to gauge Covid-19 and its severity. Data provided by the government in reply to a number of questions by Congress MLAs show that there are 20 districts which do not have a single CT scan machine and 28 districts do not have any MI machine. In the past two years, only one new CT scan machine has been purchased and installed at the Vadodara hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/only-16-ct-scanners-at-govt-hospitals/articleshow/81676882.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Season of discontent: Water woes focus of poll campaign in parched Purulia||Birchali/Baghmundi: The promise to alleviate water crisis is emerging to be the focal point in campaigns for all parties in Purulia, be it Trinamool or BJP. While the BJP, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cited references from The Ramayana to highlight ample availability of water in the mythological times, chief minister Mamata Banerjee charted out past and present government proposals to improve water supply. Though Purulia has a long history of water scarcity, it has worsened with the growing population. According to geologists, the primary reason is lack of geologically controlled aquifers in the area. Purulia has underlain hard crystalline rocks that constrains water percolation, restricting water table formation. Last year, the Purulia district administration sent a proposal for water projects at the source of 15 irrigation dams. In 2013, the state had tried to start piped drinking water project with the help of JICA (Japan International Co-operation Agency). “It was to be over in two years but there has been a delay from Japan. If the project is finished in a year, 8 lakh people will get water connection by March 2022,” CM Banerjee said at Kashipur in Purulia on Tuesday. At Raghunathpur, she said the state planned two projects—Jal Swapna (tap water at every household) and Mati Srishti, where 25,000 hectares would be irrigated. Even as the promises flew thick and fast, thousands of villagers in Bandwan, Baghmundi, Jhalda and parts of Purulia town, continued to reel under extreme water crisis. While some trek several kilometres to fetch water, some others, like residents of Birchali village in Baghmundi, have to dig river beds. They have blocked roads multiple times and even threatened to boycott the elections, slated this Saturday, pointing out they have been denied the basic amenity for years. “The two tube wells installed a year ago has broken down and another one yields muddy and smelly water. We have to dig the river bed to get drinking water. Even this water is not safe but it is the best we have,” said Ambika Mudi from Birchali village. Home to 200-odd families, Birchali, at the foot of the Ayodhya Hills, has several brick and concrete houses and almost every household has cattle, indicating moderate prosperity. But when it comes to basic amenities, like road and water, the place lags far behind. Women here are forced to dig small bore wells with steel spatulas, beside the Bandu river, a Kangsabati tributary. Sitarani Mahato said the water was found 3ft below, where they let it to settle. They then, strain the top layer to fill their buckets. Local Trinamool leader Nabakishor Mahato said they did install tube wells but the water level was so poor it dried up within days. BJP leader Arun Mahato blamed it on the lack of planning by the Trinamool. Congress MLA Nepal Mahato was unavailable for comments. Modi brought up the reference of Ayodhya hills last week. “When Sita was thirsty, Rama had sprung a fountain at Ayodhya hills. Today, villagers can’t have water to drink or till the ground,” he said last Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/season-of-discontent-water-woes-focus-of-poll-campaign-in-parched-purulia/articleshow/81676936.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The state administration has decided that containment zones will be brought back if necessary. Cops from local police stations have already begun visiting high-rises to urge them to avoid gatherings during the ensuing festive season. A meeting of senior officers took stock of the ground situation on Wednesday. “We are still awaiting instructions from the administration but we have decided to increase awareness so that Covid protocols are maintained during Holi. We have stepped up our drive against not wearing masks and we will be deploying more men on the ground,” said a joint commissioner at Lalbazar. Police will also assist KMC carry out campaigns in neighbourhoods, particularly those localities where Holi is celebrated in a major way. While cops will try to coax people to see reason, those who continue to violate norms will be booked under the Disaster Management Act. The ramped up security will be in place from Friday evening. The ministry of health and family welfare, in a letter to the state chief secretary on Wednesday, suggested curbs in observing public festivals in the wake of the renewed rise in Covid-19 cases. “In light of the order and in view of upcoming events, such as Holi, Shab-e-Barat, Bihu, Easter, Eid-ul-Fitr etc, it is strongly advised that states may consider imposing local restrictions in public observation of these festivals and limit or do away with mass gatherings under Section 22 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005,” ministry additional secretary Arti Ahuja wrote in a letter to the state.

In another major decision, railways has decided to allow entry of passengers inside waiting rooms only after proper check. Railway staff on duty must wear their identity cards. Railways has strictly warned against use of alcohol and smoking on railway premises and running trains. Delinquent passengers would be forwarded to jail as per railway laws, the CPRO said, adding ‘meri saheli’, a wing of RPF women team, has been deployed at all major stations in the wake of Holi festive season. Besides, ECR has started a cell for women safety and launched the numbers 09771425718/09760534063 for that purpose. Women passengers could dial either on this number in case of any problem facing them on running trains or on railway platforms. Altogether 42 women constables headed by nine women sub-inspectors have been deployed at all major stations, including Patna Junction, sources said, adding that 400 long-distance mail and express trains passing or originating from ECR jurisdiction were being escorted by both RPF and GRP men during the pre-lockdown period. Railways has also displayed the numbers of RPF and GRP officials in a few long-distance trains to contact them in any emergency. “Mock drills are being held frequently to check alertness of railway security personnel during night train escort duty,” an RPF official of Danapur said. To provide assistance to women on railway platforms, railways has set up helpline booths at Patna Junction and other stations. These helpline booths are being managed by woman RPF constables on platforms, sources said, adding long distance special passenger trains originating from Patna Junction and Rajendra Nagar Terminal are now under strict surveillance of the RPF and GRP personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/railways-beefs-up-security-for-women-passengers/articleshow/81675634.cms||Kumod Verma

The recent decision to allow such students write the exam from elsewhere — if schools forwarded their cases — has brought a sigh of relief to those stuck in other locations. Schools are compiling a list of such students and have started co-ordinating with the Board for their respective exam centres. A large number of city schools say that till the circular from the Board came to allow students take their exams from elsewhere, they were fretting if they would lose an entire year because of location issues. A majority of these students are stuck either because their parents or grandparents are ill or because their parents had been transferred in the midst of the pandemic. Some had gone abroad after their last-year’s exams and have not been able to return till date. They were all attending online classes from elsewhere but were not sure if they would be able to write the Board exams at all. At Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, there are two such students, one of them had been attending online classes from Dubai and taking all exams virtually. “We have sent the details of both these students to the Board and getting their alternative venues fixed. We are just as relieved as our students are,” said Meena Kak, director of the school. There are four such students in DPS Ruby Park. One of them will now write the exam from Giridih in Jharkhand and another from Tinsukia in Assam. The two others are in East Midnapore and West Burdwan. “These students are all writing their CBSE XII this time,” said Indrani Chattopadhyay, vice-principal of the school. A Class XII student of BDMI School who has been in Delhi with her mother, who had gone there for treatment, will now take her exam from there, confirmed principal Vijaya Chowdhury. “Had the circular come a few days earlier, we would have been able to help a Class XII boy who had to make a huge effort coming back to the city from Chennai, where he had been caught up with his parents,” said Amita Prasad, director of Indus Valley World School. However, the circular has come just in time for a Class X student of Birla High School whose father was transferred to Jodhpur six months ago. “We are now helping him with a centre at Jodhpur,” said principal Loveleen Saigal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/board-students-breathe-easy-as-cbse-gives-location-option-to-those-stuck-elsewhere/articleshow/81675899.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Delhi||Hawk Eye On Super-Spreader Areas Again||New Delhi: Weekly markets, cinema halls, malls, Delhi Metro trains and places of worship have emerged as super spreader areas in the city, believed to have played a big role in the recent spike in Covid cases. The positivity rate in Delhi is on a steady rise too. Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Khirwar has issued an order asking all district magistrates to intensify surveillance efforts and boost Covid awareness in these super spreader areas.Meanwhile, random testing of passengers coming from the states where Covid cases are surging has started at railway stations, inter-state bus terminals and other places where bus travellers disembark. In recent weeks, the majority of new Covid cases have been reported from the five states of Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.“The past fortnight has seen a persistent increase in Covid cases in Delhi and the positivity rate is also rising,” the commissioner’s order stated. “It has been observed that Covid-appropriate behaviour is not being enforced among the general public. There are several super spreader areas like weekly markets, cinema halls, malls, metro services, religious places, etc. All the DMs should greatly intensify their enforcement efforts and information, communication and information campaign in these areas.”DMs have also been asked to scale up the monitoring and enforcement exercise in areas that reported low seroprevalence in the city serological survey.Delhi Disaster Management Authority has ordered the district authorities to start random RT-PCR and rapid antigen testing to check any potential spread of the coronavirus in the capital by passengers travelling to Delhi from some identified hotspot states. The DMs have been asked to monitor the upscaling efforts as a topmost priority.A district official said teams of civil defence volunteers and other people have been constituted to carry out extensive monitoring of Covid-appropriate behaviour in such super spreader areas. “At weekly markets and other crowded markets, a special campaign will be run to inspect shops and traders on use of thermal scanners, compliance of mandatory face cover for customers, provision of hand sanitisers, etc,” disclosed the official. “We will also involve market associations in the strict compliance with Covid prevention norms.”After a consistent fall in the number of Covid cases by early March, many Delhiites seem to have thrown caution to the winds and disregarded preventive and protective measures like mask wearing and hand sanitation. In view of the upcoming festivals, the markets have been crowded, and it is common to see even the shopkeepers disregarding masks when it is mandatory not only for them to cover their faces, but also ensure that the shop visitors are similarly equipped.The DDMA order states that passengers travelling to Delhi from states reporting the Covid surge have to compulsorily be quarantined/isolated in their place of stay or go into institutional quarantine for 10 days if they are found to be positive for the infection. Travellers testing negative will be allowed to go home, but will need to isolate themselves and self-monitor their health for seven days. In case they develop symptoms, they have to inform the district surveillance officer on the 1075 phone line.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hawk-eye-on-super-spreader-areas-again/articleshow/81676956.cms||AlokKNMishra

The boy’s body was found lying on a cot while his father Prempal was found hanging from the ceiling, said police, adding that the post-mortem report ascertained that the boy died of strangulation and Prempal by hanging. Police said Prempal was employed as a daily wage labourer at a tea stall on the court premises and used to earn Rs 300 per day. Upon returning home from the work on Tuesday night, Prempal found his wife Lata and two minor sons — Raj (11) and six-year-old Kartik — had gone to a neighbour’s house as there was no electricity in their house following a thunderstorm, said police. He brought his children back home and asked his wife to sleep in another room while his sons would sleep with him. As Kartik started crying after some time, his mother took him with her while Raj was sleeping with his father. On Wednesday morning, when Prempal did not open the door even after knocking, his wife peeped into the room through a hole and found him hanging, said police. She immediately informed her neighbours and called police. Talking to TOI, station house officer of highway police station Vinod Kumar said an FIR was not registered as they had not received a complaint, so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/man-strangles-minor-son-to-death-then-ends-his-own-life-in-mathura/articleshow/81675127.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Kolkata||Stay@home side-effect: Screen-happy kids shun outdoors as lockdown habit lingers||Kolkata: The streets are buzzing, but the parks are no longer full of life. The lockdown might have ended several months ago, but the quick-switch to online — from classes to games — that it had necessitated, is proving a hard habit to break. In fact, its impact has been such on young minds that many children, who used to love outdoor sports earlier, are now reluctant to step out. Parks and play areas opened up since November last year in Kolkata, but the children are conspicuous by their absence. A number of them, in fact, got so hooked to playing with their friends online that they are refusing to quit the screen and return to the playgrounds. In residential complexes and neighbourhoods, parks wear a deserted look, with only a handful of senior citizens and fitness-conscious adults utilising them for morning and evening walks. Sports coaching camps have also recorded a significant drop in attendance. Piyush Shukla, who runs a badminton academy in south Kolkata, said many students have not yet turned up. While some parents continue to be cautious, there are also many who want their children to return to the playgrounds. Many, however, are unable to coax them on to the green. “I am having a tough time getting my 14-year-old daughter off her cellphone and make her go out even for a walk in the compound,” says Sujata Ghosh, who stays in a south Kolkata residential complex. Ghosh added that “nearly all” of the children in the compound were shying away from the outdoors. “Earlier, they used to play various types of games and ride their cycles, but they all stay confined to their homes now,” she told TOI. At South City Residential Complex, the scene is no different. Here, the park and game arenas opened three months ago, but very few kids reclaimed the spaces. “Less than 20% of kids are back at the playground,” says Manak Daga, president, South City Welfare Association. “We hardly see any teenager playing in the open these days.” Lockdown in Bengal was announced on March 23, a day after the nationwide ‘Janta Curfew’, but parks and public places had begun shutting down prior to that. Sports activities were allowed to begin last September and children’s parks were opened the following month. Many parents, such as Priyanka Nag, have no idea how to get their kids off the cellphone. Pre-lockdown, she simply refused to hand him over the device, but it’s now become an essential part of his study and relaxation routine. “Prior to the lockdown, he was engaged in lots of activities, from attending tuitions to playing with other children. Now, all his activities are confined to the screen,” she says. Psychologists say the effects of the pandemic on children is profound. “I have seen plenty of children in the past year, who are unwilling to step out despite being interested in outdoor games,” says clinical psychiatrist Siladitya Roy, adding, “Screens have become an addiction. Many students are feeling demotivated and disinterested in studies, and have developed lifestyle issues. They are turning obese owing to sedentary habits and a lack of exercise.” Child psychologist Devika De Ghosh is of the opinion that parents and teachers would have to play a more active role to get children off screens. “Parents have to encourage them to go out and play while maintaining Covid precautions. Teachers should also encourage them to play outdoor games. Kids should be praised and rewarded if they come up with responsible living and active behaviour. We all need to tread the middle path,” she said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stayhome-side-effect-screen-happy-kids-shun-outdoors-as-lockdown-habit-lingers/articleshow/81675903.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Nagpur||Despite revision, HCWs & FLWs continue to take 2nd dose after 4 weeks||Nagpur: Even as the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) has revised interval between two doses of Covishield to 4-8 weeks, in last two days, a few healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) in the city continued to take the second jab after a gap of four weeks from the first dose. The MoHFW in a letter dated March 22 to all state governments had said, “States and UTs are advised to ensure second dose of Covishield to beneficiaries within stipulated time interval of 4-8 weeks after the first dose.” The ministry had sent the letters accepting the recommendation of National Technical Advisory Group On Immunization (NTAGI). Earlier, the government had allowed second dose of Covishield and also Covaxin after 28 days (four weeks) of the first dose. Therefore, the minimum span is the same and maximum time period has been increased. The MoHFW said second dose should be taken within eight weeks and not later. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar told TOI, “A few HCWs and FLWs have taken the second dose of Covishield four weeks after the first dose in the last two days. This has been allowed by MoHFW. Accordingly, Co-Win application is also accepting their second dose after four weeks. It is up to the beneficiaries to decide when they have to take the second dose, but within 4-8 weeks period,” he said. On Tuesday, 261 HCWs and 595 FLWs took the second jab in the city. On Wednesday, the numbers were 246 HCWs and 416 FLWs. TOI had on March 14 reported about antibodies in eight HCWs after the first and second week of second dose of Covishield. A female radiologist happened to get high level of antibodies — 317. Vaccination in the district declined to 13,142 on Wednesday despite increase in number of centres. The NMC has continued vaccination in 74 centres while zilla parishad (ZP) increased centres from 86 to 93 on Wednesday. Thus, the number of centres in the district has gone up from 160 to 167. Despite increasing the number of centres, vaccination was less in Nagpur Rural on Wednesday with 6,389, including 5,440 people from age-appropriate group, taking the jab. In city, 6,735 including 4,815 senior citizens and 45-plus people with specified comorbidities took the vaccine. Total vaccination in a day had crossed 20,000 in the district on a couple of days last week. Guardian minister Nitin Raut had directed the NMC and ZP to increase vaccination to 40,000 per day and centres to 300. The NMC had, last week, sent a letter to the state seeking permission to begin vaccination in 32 private hospitals, which are not empanelled under the government’s schemes. The decision on it is pending. As per existing guidelines, the civic body can start vaccination centres in government-run hospitals and private hospitals which are empanelled under government schemes. Vaccination can be increased in the city if permission is received to start inoculation in these 32 private hospitals. Eleven of the 32 private hospitals had done commendable job in vaccination of the HCWs and FLWs. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari on Wednesday wrote a letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray urging him to give nod to the NMC’s request early. Meanwhile, as per data provided by Dr Chilkar, the NMC was left with around 40,000 doses of Covishield. The stock is sufficient only for four days. The government had supplied only 15,000 doses a couple of days ago. Also, the office of deputy director of health services (DDHS) is ready for stop-gap arrangement by taking doses from other districts of Nagpur division and giving for the NMC as like done in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-revision-hcws-flws-continue-to-take-2nd-dose-after-4-weeks/articleshow/81676960.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Delhi||Public meets banned for festivals, govt informs Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi government on Wednesday informed the high court that Delhi Disaster Management Authority has prohibited public gatherings, including for festival celebrations and protests, in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases. The submission was made before Justice Prathiba M Singh during the hearing of petitions filed by AAP MLAs Raghav Chadha and Atishi Marlena seeking permission to protest outside the residences of home minister Amit Shah and lieutenant governor Anil Baijal. DDMA has issued an order on March 23 prohibiting all public gatherings in the capital in view of the recent surge in Covid-19 cases, the government said. Following the contention, the high court asked the two lawmakers if they were still pressing their pleas challenging the denial of permission to protest as “circumstances have changed.” The counsels for the MLAs said they would file fresh affidavits. The government had earlier told the court that Chadha and Atishi cannot protest outside the homes of Shah and Baijal as political gatherings were prohibited by DDMA till January 31. On December 18, 2020, Delhi Police told the court that permissions were denied to the two AAP MLAs on the basis of the orders passed by DDMA. It had also said that in accordance with a Supreme Court order, a standing order was issued prohibiting protests and dharnas in residential areas. Both AAP MLAs were detained on December 13, along with other AAP members, for attempting to protest at the sites without necessary permission. They wanted to protest against the alleged misappropriation of funds by the north civic body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/public-meets-banned-for-festivals-govt-informs-hc/articleshow/81676968.cms||---

Built by Pathans from Peshawar over 150 years ago, the bridge, situated at an altitude of 11,000 feet, is of both historic and strategic importance. It offers a stunning view of the Nelong valley landscape and was part of a trade route between India and Tibet in earlier times. Pratap Singh Pawar, range officer of Gangotri National Park, who has jurisdiction over the area where the structure lies, said, “The area is rich in flora and fauna and is home to rare animals like snow leopard and Himalayan blue sheep. If all goes well, the region — which has a mountain desert landscape like Lahaul-Spiti — will be opened up for tourists by July. Other things like the number of visitors to be allowed, the ticket pricing and other formalities will be decided once 50% of the restoration work is complete.” He added that the PWD has started work on the structure earlier this month. Doon-based heritage activist and anthropologist Lokesh Ohri, who had visited the region in 2019, said that the bridge was earlier an important route for cross-border trade between India and Tibet.  “It was one of the oldest trading routes for transporting wool, salt, jaggery and spices among other items. Such trade and related activities were the source of livelihood for the Bhutia community in Uttarkashi,” he added. He stressed that the PWD must retain the uniqueness and originality of the bridge during its restructuring. Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board joint director Vivek Chauhan meanwhile told TOI that the plan to develop Gartang Gali as a major tourist destination was initiated after the Union government removed it from the innerline permit area sometime ago. RS Khatri, executive engineer, PWD (Bhatwari) when enquired about the progress of the work, said that the repairing of the bridge is being done at a cost of Rs 64 lakh and it is estimated that the work would be completed by June this year. He added that the repairs are being impacted due to continuous snowfall in the area and the precarious terrain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/gartang-gali-150-yr-old-wooden-skywalk-bridge-in-nelong-valley-to-be-open-for-tourists-soon/articleshow/81675910.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Ahmedabad||Jethava murder: HC to hear Dinu Solanki’s plea||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has decided to expedite the hearing on appeal filed by ex-MP from Junagadh, Dinu Bogha Solanki, who is convicted to life imprisonment along with six others in connection with the murder of RTI activist Amit Jethava. The bench headed by Chief Justice Vikram Nath has fixed regular hearing on the appeals against conviction from April 19. The bench had decided to give priority to the case following the directions issued by the Supreme Court in a PIL in which the apex court ordered all courts to expedite the prosecutions involving MPs and MLAs. Solanki is a prime accused in the case and therefore the high court can hear the appeal under the SC’s directions, the judges said during a hearing on Wednesday. The judges told the advocates involved in the case that they have to complete certain cases before March 31 and therefore, they would not be in a position to hear the case on Wednesday. This was after all the lawyers said that they were ready with the case. Earlier, both the sides – accused persons’ lawyers as well as the advocate representing Jethava’s father Bhikhalal – had sought time from the court saying that it would take time to prepare because the case record is voluminous running into some 20,000 pages. On Wednesday, the court’s attention was drawn to an appeal filed by Bhikhalal in the SC seeking direction to the HC that it should not hurry to hear the case and that the hearing should not be granted to these convicts out of turn, because many criminal appeals in life conviction matters older than this case are pending in the high court. The judges said that Bhikhalal’s appeal is pending in the apex court, which has not issued any restraining orders. Until the SC issues any direction in this case, the high court will go ahead following the directions issued by the SC in the PIL for expediting cases involving the politicians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jethava-murder-hc-to-hear-dinu-solankis-plea/articleshow/81676983.cms||---
---||Nagpur||In a 1st, HC hears GMCH plea to restart 90-bed basement ward at 10.15 in night||Nagpur: Responding to seriousness of the situation wherein many breathless Covid-19 patients were waiting in queue outside Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) to get admitted, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court conducted hearing at 10.15pm on Tuesday at the administrative judge’s home. Showing empathy for 60 patients, who failed to get Covid beds in view of the sudden spike in infection cases, a division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Avinash Gharote allowed the GMCH administration to accommodate them at its basement ward. Some of those patients were serious and needed oxygen immediately, prompting the GMCH administration to knock the HC’s doors at night. The GMCH had made arrangements for 90 oxygenated beds at the basement ward last year. However, after it was waterlogged following rains on August 31, the high court had on September 29 prohibited the GMCH to keep patients there stating that the area had become unhygienic. It all started when GMCH dean approached government pleader Ketki Joshi’s office at about 7.30pm on Tuesday to fix the hearing on the next day on an urgent basis citing the increasing number of patients. She then called up HC registrar (judicial) Amit Joshi, who assured her of fixing the hearing on priority. At 9 pm, the dean called Joshi stating that many patients urgently require oxygenated beds and the number of of such persons was increasing. If not provided immediate treatment, there’s danger to their lives. Joshi then asked the registrar to apprise the judges of the situation and try to arrange an urgent hearing. After the judges’ approval, within one hour, everything was arranged by the registrar’s office, including videoconferencing facility at Justice Shukre’s office in his bungalow. Even Justice Gharote, amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar, NMC counsel Sudhir Puranik, registrar and the GP reached the venue along with officials from the collectorate and GMCH dean. After hearing commenced at 10.15pm, the GP showed photographs of the refurbished basement ward on her mobile stating that PWD had addressed the drainage problem and mosquito nets have been fitted on all windows. She said all 90 beds have oxygen facilities where serious patients could be accommodated. Sensing urgency, the judges dictated order modifying its earlier decision and allowed GMCH to admit patients at the basement ward.

Assistant municipal commissioner Kishori Shinde (32), in-charge of Wanowrie-Ramtekdi civic ward, registered an FIR relating to rioting, obstructing public servants from discharging duty and disobedience against Babar and others with the Wanowrie police station on Tuesday night. Babar said, “I have twice discussed the issue of garbage collection with Shinde and she inspected the areas. She had sought eights days’ time to tackle the issue. Even after two months, no action has been taken. I have thrice raised the issue in the ward committee meetings, but the officials are not ready to take serious cognizance of the complaints.” “The civic body has shown promptness in registering FIR. They should instead show their efficiency in dealing with public complaints on priority,” he said. Senior inspector Deepak Lagad said, “Babar and others had barged into Shinde’s cabin in her absence and dumped dry/wet garbage there because PMC officials had failed to tackle garbage problems. MNS party workers pushed two civic officials and restrained them from entering the cabin. Shinde registered a complaint after seeking permission from the PMC commissioner. No arrests have been made in the case yet,” Lagad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/protesters-dump-trash-at-ward-office/articleshow/81675934.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Patna||Patna HC praises principal for cleaning school toilets||PATNA: The principal of Lokeshwari Girls’ High School, Alka Sinha, on Wednesday appeared before the Patna high court after cleaning the students’ toilets as a committee of three women advocates had found them dirty during inspection. Sinha showed to the high court the pictures showing her cleaning the toilets herself. The bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar as well as the counsels, including additional advocate general Anjani Kumar, present during the hearing praised the principal, who cited several constraints, including lack of human resources and funds for proper upkeep of the toilets. She assured the high court to keep the toilets clean in future. On Tuesday, the high court had directed Sinha and principals of four other girls’ schools in the city to physically appear as the toilets for students in their institutions were found dirty during inspection by the committee. Bankipore Girls’ High School principal was called because male police personnel stationed on the premises were found to be using girls’ toilets in the school during inspection. The principal submitted that they have been already removed. The bench had taken suo motu cognisance of the problems faced by girl students due to non-availability of clean toilets, water supply and other basic facilities in toilets inside school and colleges. The high court had turned into PIL a report published in a vernacular daily in this regard on April 10, 2018. On March 9, the high court had formed a three-member committee of Archana Sinha Shahi, Anukriti Jaipuriyar and Amrisha Srivastava for inspecting all colleges of Patna and Patliputra universities and government schools in municipal limits of Patna to know the reality of toilet infrastructure available for girl students against the information submitted by these universities and the government. The committee was surprised to find that four schools were running together from the premises of Bapu Smarak Girls’ High School on Nala Road. The committee also highlighted shortage of funds and regular cleaning staff in the institutions. The committee specifically mentioned the Government Girls’ Middle School at Shastri Nagar, Kanya Middle School at Lalji Tola, Adarsh Kanya Middle School at Yarpur, Kanya Middle School at Amla Tola, Lokeshwari Girls High School at Kadamkuan and Rajkiya Kanya Madhya Vidyalaya at Punaichak where the toilets and other necessary infrastructure for girl students were either absent or in a very poor shape due to funds crunch and lack of regular cleaners. The committee also mentioned that the government had not reimbursed funds to these schools since 2015 against the exempted fees and other charges for girl and SC/ST students under free education policy for them. Toilets constructed by Bihar State Education Infrastructure Development Corporation (BSEIDC) were found to be worst and non-functional at TPS College and Arvind Mahila College under Patliputra University. Dirty toilets were also found at RKD College and JNL College. Some departments in Darbhanga House campus of Patna university, College of Commerce, Art and Science and AN College were found to be without separate toilets for girls. The committee mentioned that Patna College, Patna Science College and BN college under Patna University, Arvind mahila College, College of Commerce, Arts and Science and AN College under Patliputra university have toilets but were found locked by contractors and not handed over to the institution even after payments made for constructions. Looking at the overall situation, the high court directed the education department principal secretary to file a reply in personal capacity about funds allocation and other necessary action required for providing all required facilities to the girl students at these places. The court has fixed April 15 for hearing the matter again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-praises-principal-for-cleaning-school-toilets/articleshow/81677018.cms||Debashish Karmakar

No, not that they will only use powder of that colour, but for these women in east Delhi, the festival offers a way to convert the enormous floral waste in temples into environmentally friendly gulal. Thus it is that the Su-Dhara project, initiated by the office of the principal scientific adviser to the government of India through NGO Vertiver, has till now produced and sold 200 kg of herbal gulal to organisers of kirtans and local Holi events. It all started two years back when the NGO was conducting various studies, collecting ground reports and interacting with local residents to promote the waste to wealth solutions in a scientific manner. “We began by mapping the organic waste streams that could be prevented from reaching the landfills,” said Dr Shailja Gupta, project leader and senior adviser at the principal scientific adviser’s office. “But people were reluctant to handle the waste themselves.” That is where Vertiver came in. Chhaya Bhanti, founder of the NGO, said they began by connecting with institutions and organising workshops to reach a wider audience. “We spoke to temple authorities and local municipal councillors Kusum Tomar and Suman Lata Nagar and convinced them to use flowers/organic waste for making compost for their parks and green areas rather than disposing of them in rivers or landfills,” said Bhanti. “We also spread this message among temple devotees.” To demonstrate visible solutions, Su-Dhara installed low-cost bio-digester drums at Durga Mandir at Durgapuri Chowk and Sain Mandir at Kabool Nagar in east Delhi to turn the flowers into compost in partnership with East Delhi Municipal Corporation. The idea caught hold and many groups and women expressed willingness to volunteer as swacchta sevadaars for the project. Bhanti added, “Two women, Babita Goel and Prabha Aggarwal of Balbir Nagar, took the lead and got many others to together collect flowers from temples for composting. All volunteers were issued identity cards by the temples.” When the season of Holi approached, however, some women wondered whether the flowers could be turned into natural gulal rather than compost. “We all appreciated the concept,” admitted Chhaya. So eco-friendly gulal came into being. It has no artificial fragrance, pointed out volunteer Neelam Tyagi, and its packaging is also environment friendly. She elaborated, “Kulhads are filled with the colours and wrapped in colourful old cloth collected from temples to make them attractive.” Vertiver now plans to generate awareness about the waste flower possibilities at other localities and temples in east Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/when-waste-flowers-into-a-riot-of-colours/articleshow/81676975.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||Delhi: Covid resurgence pours cold water on seasonal gains||NEW DELHI: The resurgence in Covid-19 cases has led Delhi Disaster Management Authority to curb Holi celebrations in public places. The big losers are the colour and water gun sellers, who otherwise make a killing at this time of the year. They had been spared the setback last year because Holi was celebrated on March 9, weeks before the lockdown was announced. Vishwanath, 62, who sets up shop in the season of colour at Sadar Bazar, hasn’t ever experienced a year when Holi celebrations were prohibited. “I do understand these are unprecedented times, but such announcements should have been made earlier and not at the last moment in March,” he grumbled. TOI spoke to the shopkeepers, who said most buyers are individuals and only a few who are unaware of DDMA’s order are purchasing items in bulk. “We are logging losses within a day of the order,” claimed Vishwanath. “The timing of the announcement just four days from the festival is unfortunate.” There’s a bit of ironic disappointment because the shops have mostly stocked items made in India. Shopkeeper Billu said, “The infection that has left our country paralysed originated in China, so there was no way that I would sell Chinese products. I can proudly say everything I am selling are made in India. Now it seems I will have to store them till the next Holi.” While most of the shopkeepers were upset with the order, one of them was convinced about the move. “I lost two family members to Covid and so understand how dangerous the infection is,” said Anil Kumar. “Had this not been my livelihood, I would have discouraged people from revelry this year. Since cases are increasing, I have again started to distance myself from my family members when I return home. There are very high chances of getting infected in Sadar Bazar because of the crowds that come here every day. I will surely record big losses this year, but I will accept it as hard luck and move on with life.” Varun Mahesh, a buyer at Kumar’s stall, knew of the ban order and will not be engaging in community Holi in public areas. “I am buying water colours for use at home with my kids. Holi is their favourite festival and they wait for it the entire year. I will make sure they enjoy at home,” Mahesh smiled. At another shop, Sheetal and her husband haggled over the price of five water guns and 20 packs of water balloons. They had planned to throw a Holi party for friends because this is their first after marriage. The restriction has almost ruined their scheme. “We realise we won’t be able to celebrate outside the house, but we will find a way out,” Sheetal said optimistically. Like them, the handful of buyers at the wholesale markets bought colours and sprays hoping that family celebrations would be allowed if they weren’t in a public space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-resurgence-pours-cold-water-on-seasonal-gains/articleshow/81677002.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

---||Dehradun||‘Behavioural changes among Van Gujjars dividing pastoral community’||DEHRADUN: For centuries, the nomadic forest dwellers of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, known as Van Gujjars, lived in the low-altitude foothills of Shivalik range during winters and migrated to the Himalayan meadows during summers for grazing their livestock. Though eventually their grazing pastures were turned into national parks, tiger reserves and wildlife sanctuaries, these tribes continued their nomadic way of life. However, the rehabilitation of some of these families — around 232 in and around Corbett Tiger Reserve and 1393 in Rajaji reserve — over the years has led to differences within the community — in particular, rehabilitated families refusing to marry into families that haven’t been rehabilitated yet. Speaking about the differences cropping up within the community, Mohammad Shamsher, a Van Gujjar from Gouhari range of Rajaji reserve, said, “My son Aarif’s wedding was called off by a rehabilitated family from Gandikhata as they felt that their daughter won’t be able to adjust to our ‘nomadic culture and atmosphere’. The community is facing division and a threat to its culture.” Meanwhile, speaking on behalf of the rehabilitated families, Mohamad Aalam from Gaindikhata said, “They (non-rehabilitated families) travel almost 200km with buffaloes which is not possible for our daughters who were born in the rehabilitated colonies. The extreme temperatures are also problematic. That’s why we refuse their alliances.” There are over 20,000 Van Gujjars in Uttarakhand and 2,000 in Uttar Pradesh. While they are given tribal status in Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, they are yet to be counted as a separate community in Uttarakhand and are classified under Muslim Gujjars. State census unit deputy director SS Negi said, “They don’t have any SC/ST status as they are not notified by the state government.” Pointing out that the particular problems of the community must be addressed, Society for Promotion of Himalayan Indigenous Activities director Praveen Kaushal said, “It is time all stakeholders are involved and a solution be derived to resolve the genuine concerns of Van Gujjars in Uttarakhand. The community is certainly undergoing behavioural, lifestyle and cultural changes. Their practices should be preserved in a positive spirit as they are guardians of ecology.” Meanwhile, worried about the escalating differences in the community and fast- disappearing pastoralist culture along with the ecological wisdom which accompanies it, some Van Gujjars have reached out to the Anthropological Survey of India (ASI) seeking help for a demographic survey of their population and spreading awareness by including their traditional knowledge, language and handicrafts in the ASI museum. Speaking about the communication sent to the ASI and the circumstances which necessitated it, Van Gujjar Tribal Yuva Sanghthan president Mohammad Meerhamza, said, “The rehabilitated sections seek more attention and hospitality, and have a feeling that they are superior. This superficial superiority feeling should be subtly removed as they are very much a part of our community only. A study by the ASI will encourage more members of our community to protect traditional cultural and ecological wisdom.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/behavioural-changes-among-van-gujjars-dividing-pastoral-community/articleshow/81675933.cms||Shivani Azad

However, the court has now overruled the announcement in view of the rising coronavirus cases. We will abide by the guidelines and have already asked the state government to ensure all the facilities necessary to implement the norms in place.” Meanwhile, teerth purohit Ujjawal Pandit said, “We are already following Covid-19 guidelines and are also asking the devotees to abide by the norms.

---||Noida||Guests capped at 50 for Holi parties in Gautam Budh Nagar||GREATER NOIDA: Flooded with requests for permission for organising Holi parties, GB Nagar police have restricted the maximum number of guests to 50, along with taking an undertaking from the organiser. Police have said several societies have sought permission for Holi parties, but they are checking the feasibility on the basis of the number of participants and the space available. Some societies back-pedalled when asked to submit an undertaking stating that they will be held liable for any deviation from the criteria on which permission is being given, officers said. Additional commissioner of police (law and order) Love Kumar told TOI that as per directions from the UP chief secretary, occupancy of 50% for closed areas and 40% for open areas shall be allowed. “Not more than 100 persons are to be allowed for a gathering. The space has to first be inspected by the ACP of the area concerned as well as the SHO, only after which a gathering can be allowed,” he said. Police said there have been several requests for parties with an expected attendance of around 400 guests or more. ACP-2 (central Noida) Yogendra Singh said at least ten such requests have been received but none have been approved yet. “When we are asking for an undertaking from the organisers to take responsibility that in case of a problem later on, they can be held liable, the organisers are backing out,” he said. In Greater Noida too, at least 40 such requests have been received from different societies. “Only small gatherings are being allowed, and we are looking at the available space in the hall. For around 50 or a number less than that, permission can be considered, but only with social distancing. Liquor is not being allowed to be served,” additional DCP (Greater Noida) Vishal Pandey said.  Action against renting, playing DJ sets? An internal notice issued by Bisrakh police, meant for all in-charges of different chowkis, went viral in social media on Wednesday. The notice states that as per the directions of the state government, under CrPC 144, nobody will be allowed to play or rent a DJ set. “If someone is found doing this, action will be taken against that person,” states the notice. It created a flutter on social media with residents, asking if it was indeed genuine and why it was limited to Bisrakh. This led police to issue a clarification saying the notice was “incomplete.” “We will get it re-issued, adding that DJ sets can be played as per the Supreme Court guidelines keeping the volume to certain decibels,” Bisrakh SHO Anita Chauhan told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/guests-capped-at-50-for-holi-parties/articleshow/81677474.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Martyrs’ forum to file 400 nominations in Nagarjuna Sagar||HYDERABAD: The Telangana Martyrs’ Forum (TMF) is planning to take a leaf out of Nizamabad turmeric farmers’ book and file 400 nomination papers for the forthcoming Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll. Hundreds of farmers had entered the fray from Nizamabad Lok Sabha seat in 2019 elections and also from Varanasi where PM Narendra Modi was seeking a second term to highlight their plight. The TMF announced that 400 members from the families (one from each family) of those who lost their lives in the Telangana statehood agitation will file the papers as independents. Forum president M Raghuma Reddy said the plan was to stir the conscience of the TRS government for failing to support the families of the martyrs. He said: “During the statehood movement, many had lost their lives. The government has identified 1,385 martyr families but 500 families did not receive any support till now. We have decided to file 400 nominations to highlight their plight.” He said though they want to file more nominations, they have restricted the number to 400 in view of financial constraints and other difficulties. He said there are some others who received injuries during the statehood agitation or tried to harm themselves in support of the movement. After the formation of Telangana, the TRS government had promised Rs 10 lakh financial support, a government job, a house and five acres of land for the martyrs families. Raghuma Reddy said many families, however, have not received a single penny from the government. Raghuma Reddy said they would seek the support of YS Sharmila, who is all set to launch her own party in Telangana. The TMF chief said several associations, including Dalit Joint Action Committee of Osmania University, are supporting their cause.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/martyrs-forum-to-file-400-nominations-in-nsagar/articleshow/81677032.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Delhi||Ration at doorstep in Delhi: Scheme to have no name||NEW DELHI: The doorstep delivery of ration scheme will not have any name now. Last week, the Centre had objected to the AAP government’s flagship scheme stating that highly subsidised foodgrains from the central pool under National Food Security Act couldn’t be used for the Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna, which was expected to be rolled out on March 25. The Delhi cabinet chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday approved the scheme to be rolled out without any name. The scheme will now be sent to the Centre for its approval. Kejriwal said beneficiaries face several issues while collecting ration from fair price shops. At times, they don’t even get the rations. This had prompted Delhi government to deliver packed rations at their doorstep. The Centre’s objection came as a shock to Delhi government. “Perhaps, the Centre had an objection to the word mukhyamantri. Therefore, we have decided to roll out the scheme without any name,” the CM added. The AAP government hopes that the Centre will give its nod to the revised scheme under which wheat flour, rice and sugar would be delivered to homes in packed bags in place of loose rations. The government believes that this will help weed out the ration mafia and beneficiaries will get the advantage of the scheme. Moreover, taking rations from public distribution system (PDS) shops will become optional. “We do not want any credit for this scheme. That’s why the name is being removed. There will be no mention of mukhyamantri anywhere. Delhi government just wants to provide ration in good quality and quantity to people,” said Kejriwal. The doorstep delivery of ration, which led to confrontation between Delhi government and the Centre, is the brainchild of Kejriwal, who struggled for years to make PDS transparent before he joined politics. The scheme was designed in early 2018, but could not be passed because the lieutenant governor had different views. He had asked the AAP government to send the proposal to the Centre with all implementation details for approval. This was one of the reasons behind Kejriwal and his ministers holding days-long dharna at Raj Bhavan in June 2018. Later, the food department referred the file to the law department to seek its opinion in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ration-at-doorstep-scheme-to-have-no-name/articleshow/81677042.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Delhi||Appointment of registrar sparks fresh row at JNU||New Delhi: Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) has raised questions on the appointment of the new registrar, stating that the move was not approved by the executive council (EC). Anirban Chakraborty was appointed as the registrar on March 17. The teachers said that an office order stated that Chakraborty was appointed following “due approval from the competent authority”. “The question is precisely this — who is the competent authority in the matter of appointment of the registrar? Statute 8(1) of university rules categorically states that the registrar shall be appointed by the EC and be a whole-time salaried officer of the university,” said the JNUTA statement, adding that there had neither been a meeting on the matter, nor any specific approval sought. The teachers also pointed out that the presence of the registrar in the executive council was not permitted under JNU’s statutes. “EC is the highest statutory body of a university, whose approval is required in all matters related to it.” “The newly appointed registrar’s backdoor entry into the executive council by a fiat issued by the vice-chancellor is not just suspicious, but also illegal. To make matters worse, for the first time in the history of JNU, the registrar has been recorded as being a member of the executive council. Statute 8 (3) explicitly states that ‘the registrar shall not by reason only of his being secretary of the court, the executive and the academic councils be deemed to be a member of any of these authorities’. Despite this, both the outgoing and the incumbent registrar have been mentioned as members of the EC in the agenda of the 294th executive council meeting due on Friday,” added the statement. JNUTA has also reacted to the statement issued by the registrar on Tuesday, where the association was termed as “handful of teachers” trying to disrupt the image of the university. The administration did not respond to the allegations of the teachers’ association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/appointment-of-registrar-sparks-fresh-row-at-jnu/articleshow/81677031.cms||---

With senior citizens being escorted by family members plus the regular crowd at any hospital converging, many feel that the area in and around a vaccination centre can itself turn into a super spreader. City residents say the hospital authorities must take due precaution so that their safety is guaranteed. Ramesh Jahagirdar, a senior citizen of the city, said “In order to avoid chaos at vaccination centres, the hospital staff should make different counters and queues for people who are getting the second dose and those who are getting the first dose of the vaccines. They should ramp up efforts so as to maintain Covid distancing at all times.” He said he will comply with the new government guidelines which suggest that second dose be taken after six weeks but another senior citizen, Maniklal Bombarde, is keen on taking the second dose at the first opportunity available. “I will take the second shot of the vaccine at the earliest. Covid has had a deep impact on the economy and many businesses haven't recovered ground yet even after a year. My daughter has been urging people around us to get vaccinated as soon as possible so that we could contain the spread of the virus and people will be back on track rather than struggling to make ends meet,” Bombarde said. He said that vaccination centres need to plan in advance. “They should take extra precautions to avoid crowding of first dose and second dose recipients. They can set up different timings for people who are supposed to take the second dose,” he said. TH Naidu, a retired city resident, too says he’s ready for the second dose. “The vaccination centres should admit more people during specific time slots so that maximum people are vaccinated and Covid guidelines are followed at the same time. The centres should segregrate people according to which dose they are coming for. Vaccinating more and more people in a short span of time is the way to go if we want to contain the spread,” he said. He said he is not at all hesitant about taking the second dose of the Covid vaccine as soon as the waiting period is over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/people-seek-better-planning-for-second-dose-of-vaccination/articleshow/81677029.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In the past one week over 722 such people were sent for RT-PCR testing of which 14 people tested positive.Despite repeated appeals being made to people for following Covid norms, a large section of the people are neglecting the importance of wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and following other norms.During the drive, two other people were also slapped with a fine of Rs 1,000 each for not maintaining social distancing. As part of the drive, the police also maintain vigil to ensure that shops for non-essential commodities and other establishments are closed by 7 pm as per instructions issued by district collector Suraj Mandhare.

According to the police, one of the accused — Sameer — runs an automobile repair shop in the area where the 15-year-old girl is living with her family. A month ago, he befriended the Class 10 student, and called her to his shop on March 11. His uncle Deepak was also present at the shop. She was raped by Sameer on March 11 at the repair shop, while a video of the act was recorded by his uncle, said a police officer, adding that Deepak also raped her after threatening her that he would circulate the video on social media if she resisted. The teenager, according to the police, was again called by Sameer and Deepak on March 21 to the shop, promising her that they would delete her video. However, the duo, along with their friend Shoaib, allegedly raped her again. A family member said she came home and didn't eat food for two days after the incident. She told her parents that she was not well. On March 24, the girl told her mother about the ordeal she had to undergo. Following this, her parents went to the police station and filed a complaint against the three accused. The girl’s father runs a dhaba in the same area. Nipun Aggarwal, SP (city-1), said that on the basis of the girl’s complaint, an FIR has been registered under the Section of 376D (gang rape) of IPC and under relevant sections of POCSO Act. “During interrogation, the accused confessed that they have raped the teen. We have recovered the phone on which they recorded the video,” Aggarwal said. “We arrested the three on Tuesday night.

---||Nagpur||Allow weddings in halls, lawns: Association||Nagpur: The association of owners of marriage halls and lawns has claimed that organizing marriage functions at home was a key reason for the spread of Covid-19 in the city. Addressing a press conference, Nagpur Mangal Karyalaya Va Lawns Association executive members questioned if weddings at banquet halls, lawns and hotels were responsible for the spike in Covid-19 cases and shutting them down was the answer. They asked, what about the risk associated with holding such functions at home? “Does a common person’s house have enough space to accommodate guests while following physical distancing norms? Is there any thermal screening of guests and a check on the mask norm?” the association asked. “Weddings hosted at banquet halls, lawns and hotels are safer given the ample space as compared to functions at home. All requisite safety norms like use of sanitizer, thermal screening, physical distancing and wearing face masks are strictly enforced by us,” said the association’s Sanjay Kale. “Besides this, we screen all agencies and workers involved in these weddings,” he said. The lives of those working or dependent on the wedding industry too are important, the association said. If stopping weddings at such facilities was the answer to stop the spread of Covid-19 infection, then what is the answer to the decision that sounds death knell for the wedding industry, ruining thousands of lives and livelihood of people dependent on it, the association asked. The association has urged Nagpur Municipal Corporation to allow weddings in halls and lawns with up to 200 guests or 50% capacity, whichever is less, as per unlock guidelines of Union ministry of home affairs. It also pointed out that such a relaxation was permitted by Pune Municipal Corporation till last week despite a high Covid-19 prevalence. The association urged the authorities to allow wedding functions at halls and lawns in the city to salvage the beleaguered wedding industry. In a memorandum submitted to all Maharashtra cabinet ministers, central ministers, NMC commissioner, collector and mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, the association’s Ashish Deshmukh pointed out that the administration should understand that clamping lockdown was not the answer any more because finally it is every citizen who needs to be made aware, and needs to follow protocols laid by the government to contain the spread of coronavirus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/allow-weddings-in-halls-lawns-association/articleshow/81677048.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Delhi||Delhi: Sarojini traders take Covid safety in their own hands||NEW DELHI: Taking note of increasing chaos at Sarojini Nagar Market, shopkeepers themselves are coming forward to implement measures for social distancing. Traders’ associations have installed hoardings at the entry and exit points asking people to wear masks properly, maintain social distancing and avoid gathering in large groups. “We have drawn circles outside shops for visitors to maintain social distancing. Two people at small stalls and three at big shops are allowed to stand at a time and the rest are asked to wait in a queue outside. Of late, crowding was observed around shops and stalls that could have led to the spread of the viral infection,” said Ashok Randhawa, president of Mini Market Traders’ Association, Sarojini Nagar. Some traders have also closed the trial rooms. Customers are being asked to try apparels at their home and return the bought items in 2-3 days if those don’t fit them well. “We have asked traders to minimise interactions and ensure people entering their shops wear masks and use sanitisers,” said Randhawa. Ashok Kalra of Sarojini Nagar Market Association (big shops) said that traders have installed hoardings at entry gates near their shops. “We have also planned to draw circles around shops and will take a final decision on this after the executive members’ meeting on Friday. Regarding sanitisation and awareness programmes also, we have taken some steps because we want all customers as well as shopkeepers to stay safe,” he said. The traders claimed to have requested Delhi Police and the local administration to increase the number of civic defence volunteers and staff for keeping check on violators and ensuring that people wear masks properly. “Most of the people visiting the market wear masks. But the problem is that they are wearing them below their nose or chin, a practice which will go only when there would be strict implementation of norms,” said a trader. At Connaught Place, the traders’ association has circulated a DM’s letter to follow the Covid norms. “Our members are already alert and following the norms strictly. Also, there are stickers pasted on the floor and gates of shops for maintaining social distancing,” said Amit Gupta, executive member of New Delhi Traders’ Association. Public gatherings during Holi and other upcoming festivals have been banned in the city in the wake of the recent surge in Covid cases. “In our market, we have already spread awareness about it,” said Rakesh Yadav, president of Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders’ Associations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sarojini-traders-take-covid-safety-in-their-own-hands/articleshow/81696339.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Lucknow||Buzz missing in biz; sops galore for customers||Innovation in providing services, added benefits to draw customers and assuring safety protocols are some of the ways which are helping local businesses cope with an unprecedented year of crises. Local grocery stores  Various local grocery stores have started home delivery services after the lockdown. “Unlike big retailers which have fixed minimum order amount for delivery, we have put no condition and even cater to low-income groups and give discounts on products to compete with big players,” said Jatin Bansal, a grocer in Triveninagar. Ruchir Awasthi, a store owner in Kapoorthala, has started home delivery only for the elderly and students living in small rented accommodations. “People in these groups do not order in bulk, but need support to survive. In return, we get some business,” he said. Iqbal, who has a makeshift vegetable and fruit shop in Rahimnagar, has put his two sons on home delivery duty. “We can’t cater to all, but serve the elderly and regular customers,” he said. Electronics  The electronics and gadgets market is still recovering from the beating. Traders said online giants had damaged prospects even before the pandemic, but the situation aggravated last year. Traders were expecting an increase in sales with work from home culture, but when that did not happen as per expectations, they came up with their own EMI schemes. Lucknow Traders’ Association secretary Pawan Manocha said, “Customers in low-income groups do not have credit cards required for EMI option offered by most online giants, hence we rolled out our own EMI scheme by taking photocopies of bank passbook and PAN card. Our scheme added benefits like repair guarantee and free accessories.” Multiplexes Both single-screen theatres and multiplexes are reeling under crisis because most new releases are now on OTT platforms and people are still avoiding theatres. Director in a multiplex chain, Yogesh Raizada, said, “Despite all provisions for Covid safety, our business has dropped by 90%. Before the pandemic, average footfall in a multiplex used to be 1,000 per day, but now it is 100.” Audiences are still not enthusiastic about theatres. Movie buff Aastha Sinha said, “OTT platforms are safer in times of a pandemic and also cheaper. I don’t think I will be going to watch a movie in a theatre till Covid-19 subsides completely.” Grooming Mohammad Rizwan, who runs a small salon in Gole Market, has divided his day into two. The first half is for customers who still visit the salon while the second is for home services to customers who are scared of visiting. “I follow all safety protocols, but people are scared and are switching over to app-based services. I had to find a middle path to survive,” he said. In Aashiana, Priya Kashyap had to shut down her small beauty parlour. “My parlour has just two seats with little space to move around, hence physical distancing is impossible. As people stopped coming, I had to pack up because I was unable to pay rent. Now, I am offering services at home to customers,” she said. Gyms Among the worst hit, gyms have not been able to return to even 50% business. “Forget about new customers, even those with two- or three-year membership are not coming,” said Parth Nigam, gym owner in Indiranagar. However, sales of gym equipment like dumbbells, barbells, bench press, cables and pulleys have increased. Tanay Gulati, owner of a gym equipment shop in Aminabad, said that sales have been record breaking. “The number of dumbbells sold from May 2020 till date is more than the sales in 2019 and 2020 till March.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/buzz-missing-in-biz-sops-galore-for-customers/articleshow/81677524.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

Rajouri Garden councillor Col Balram Oberoi earlier said that over 250 borewell points in parks in his area were getting sealed.Abhishek Dutt, Congress councillor from Andrews Ganj, raised the matter of compensation to the families of sanitation workers who passed away due to Covid-19 while performing their duties. They should not be treated differently from other Covid warriors and their families too should get Rs 1 crore, the councillor said.

The issue was raised by Congress MLA Kirit Patel in the state assembly where he stated that the poor implementation of the seventh pay commission benefits has resulted in pay cuts for teachers. The 2,000 odd faculty members, instead of getting a hike in their salary after moving from sixth pay commission to seventh pay, saw a significant reduction in their monthly cheques, according to Patel. The government needs to resolve this and few other issues including the replacement of the pension scheme introduced in 2005 with the earlier family pension scheme, he said. Two years ago, the state education department passed a general resolution clearing payment of Seventh Pay commission benefits to the teaching staff at college under University Grants Commission (UGC) from January 1, 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pay-of-2k-faculty-members-cut/articleshow/81677057.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Double mutation variant not linked to surge yet: Experts||Pune: Nearly 15-20% of 1,600 Covid samples sent from the state for genome sequencing have been found with a variant of SARS-CoV-2 that has a double mutation.The double variant has a combination of two mutations — E484Q and L452R. The E484Q mutation has been detected in Maharashtra before and the L452R was found in patients in California, where experts believe it caused higher Covid spread.But director of the National Centre for Disease Control Dr Sujit Singh said, so far, no link has been established to say mutations alone have been responsible for the Covid-19 spike in some states. “There are various other reasons behind a surge,” he said.Genome sequencing of 223 samples from Mumbai has found the presence of the UK strain in 22 so far. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said all 22 patients have been treated and discharged. “We haven’t been told of any other variant or mutation being found in Mumbai so far,” said Kakani, adding that the results pertained to samples collected between December and February.Experts have said virus mutations are common and since December-end, at least 771 ‘variants of concern’ (VOCs) — from 10,787 positive samples — have been identified in the country. “Genomic mutation in RNA viruses is a normal phenomenon. About 5-6% mutation is considered normal,” said Singh.Singh said scientists are keen on going into the micro level to establish district-wise epidemiological linkage. “Only when these mutations are correlated with the existing public health scenario can we say that these new variants are a matter of concern. As of now, more scientific evidence is needed to say, with certainty, that the surge in Maharashtra is attributable to new virus variants,” he said.Singh said of the 1,600 samples from Maharashtra, 1,149 were from the community. Of these, 206 samples reported the double mutations (E484Q+L452R). Another 118 samples with just the L452R mutation and 112 samples with only E484 were also detected. “We are correlating the results. The mere presence of mutants does not reveal much, unless they also possess characteristics that are associated with faster transmission or severe infection.”The variant with a double mutation has now been categorised as a potential VOC.(With inputs from Sumitra Deb Roy in Mumbai)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/double-mutation-variant-not-linked-to-surge-yet-experts/articleshow/81677281.cms||Nisha Nambiar

In fact, tests over the first two days — 33,553 — together fall short of the target.The RAT were conducted on Tuesday at various crowded places namely malls, stations, market areas and bus depots. Of the total 17,782 tests, the maximum (2,661) were in L ward (Kurla), followed by H-East ward (Bandra East, Kalina) where 2,530 tests were conducted, and K-East ward (Andheri East, Jogeshwari) where 1,906 were done.L ward has the Kurla Nehru Nagar ST bus depot, LTT terminus and also Phoenix Market City mall under its jurisdiction. “In malls, we are testing staff of stores too as they could be super spreaders. With many customers visiting a store, in case of a staff being asymptomatic, the virus could spread further,” said Dr Jitendra Jadhav, medical health officer of L ward.Reacting to these tests, the Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI), which represents many major malls in the city, wrote to Chahal requesting the civic body to reconsider its decision of RAT tests before entry to malls as this would dissuade genuine shoppers and have a spiralling effect on retail.Instead, the letter said, BMC can start vaccination camps at malls across the city. “As a public infrastructure, with ample parking space and training rooms, malls do have the requisite space to help carry out such an exercise that will likely benefit the larger cause of carrying out an extensive vaccination drive…”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/random-antigen-test-numbers-stay-low-for-2nd-day/articleshow/81677348.cms||Richa Pinto

The union claims it waited 10 days, and will now hold event whether it gets the permit or not. This is when the Covid situation has gone serious in Ropar. Hola Mohalla began on Wednesday with ‘Akhand Path’ at Kiratpur Sahib in Ropar district and the march of pilgrims to Anandpur Sahib has started. The crowd will swell to several lakh between March 24 and 29. Union convener Shamsher Singh said: “Our conference is on March 28 in Anandpur Sahib. Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) of Delhi is invited and farmer unionists Darshanpal, Gurnam Singh Charuni, and J S Dalewal will address the crowd. We will not wait for a nod from the district administration, which has sat on our request since March 15.” The convener added: “Hola Mohalla was always a political stage, except last year.” Anandpur Sahib SDM Kanu Garg appealed to the union to wait for permission, as the request was under consideration. No political conference was being held, and no party even sought permission. The Ropar administration has asked foreign pilgrims to carry a Covid-negative report not older than 48 hours. Guests at inns and hotels should also get tested, while travel agents have been asked to motivate foreign pilgrims to get examinied. Ropar health department has deployed 14 teams for voluntary random samplings. SDM said: “We cannot force pilgrims, but we appeal them to get tested and help us meet out 1,000 daily random sampling target.” The Virasat-e-Khalsa memorial will be open from 8am to 8pm. “The timings were extended for pilgrims but they’ll be ushered in only batches of 200. They’ll also need a pass. This is to ensure social distancing,” the SDM said. Ropar DC Sonali Giri said: “So far, we have received no foreign pilgrim for testing, but celebrations have just started and there’s not much crowd on first day. Hotel guests must either undergo Covid test or carry a negative report.” Of the 1,57,423 samples collected from the district, so far, 4,675 have tested positive. And 82 of those reports came on Wednesday, when 30,902 patients recovered. The district active cases are 584, while 1,195 sample reports are pending. The DC said the Covid situation in past 15 days had become worrisome and the government should issue people general guideline to wear mask and maintaining social distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-permit-but-hola-mohalla-is-on/articleshow/81677054.cms||Bharat Khanna

---||Chandigarh||Covid norms: Farm bodies take it easy||BATHINDA: Despite a steep rise in Covid-19 cases in Punjab with the new strain coming to the fore, the protesting farmer organisations have still not decided to direct the protesters to start wearing masks and maintain social distancing as a precaution. Farm organisations feel that any such move could be counterproductive for the sustained struggle as the protesting farmers could be scared away and may start staying away from the larger gatherings. The largest farm organization, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan), has categorically rejected the appeals to make farmers wear mask and maintain physical distancing. It says till now, more than 300 protesting farmers have lost their lives during the ongoing struggle and the postmortem has not revealed any case of Covid among the casualties. Even though organisation president Joginder Singh Ugrahgan has tested positive, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) said he had some health issues after getting exhausted from his unending schedules of addressing gatherings at Tikri and various other kisan mahapanchayats. This despite the fact that thousands of farmers are assembling at protest sites without any caution. “Though we do not reject Covid, we are not going to adopt the precautions suggested by governments. These are only to scare away us and defeat our strong struggle. If we ask our activists to wear masks, they will scare away which governments in the state and Centre want. We will not accept this. And if governments are so concerned, then why didn’t they make the norms must for the political rallies presently going on in five states. Is Corona not for them?” said BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri. (BKU Dakonda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh said so far, they have not felt any such need to ask the protesters to compulsorily wear masks as farm organisations don’t want protesters to fear from it. “But if anyone want to wear mask, he could,” he added. “We have not come across any fear of Coronavirus in the minds of protesters, so there is need to panic over it,” said BKU (Krantikari) president Surjit Singh Phool.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-norms-farm-bodies-take-it-easy/articleshow/81677068.cms||Neel Kamal

His family has received a message on the mobile phone, demanding a ransom of Rs 20 lakh for his release. Surendra’s uncle Shyodan Singh said his nephew had gone to the farm on Monday and had been missing since then. They tried to search for him at every possible place, but failed, said Singh. “We have, meanwhile, received a message on my nephew's cell phone number on Tuesday, demanding a ransom Rs 20 lakh,” said Singh, adding that they immediately informed police. The message sender's mobile number has been switched off since then, he said. SSP Muniraj G said the phone’s last location was traced to Hyderabad. “Teams have been formed and he will be rescued soon,” said the SSP, adding that an FIR was registered into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/iti-student-abducted-in-aligarh-rs-20-lakh-ransom-sought-for-release/articleshow/81675179.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Stating that the government should set right its priorities, Jaleel said that having well-equipped hospitals is need of the hour. “I wish to seek some honest answers from the finance minister who took away MPLAD funds from all the MPs for two years while citing that you will use the money for improving medical infrastructure of the country,” Jaleel said. “We all chipped in because we all were facing one of the worst times in the country hoping that the money will be used for improving medical infrastructure. Especially for improving medical facilities in rural parts of the country, especially Maharashtra, where the rural hospitals are still in shambles,” he added. All the MPs, including those from the BJP want the MPLAD funds reinstated. “None of the MPs including from the BJP and its alliance partners, will take up the issue. Instead they request us to speak on this topic as they claim that they cannot speak about it,” Jaleel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/improve-medical-infra-says-jaleel/articleshow/81674438.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: BJP team urges governor to send a report to Centre||MUMBAI: A delegation of BJP leaders led by opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis met Governor B S Koshyari on Wednesday morning, demanding that a report be submitted to the Centre on the current situation in Maharashtra. Terming the government as a “Maha Vasooli Aghadi,” Fadnavis said, referring to the alleged corrupt practices, that “all this was going on merely for power.” “All the incidents that are tumbling out are worrying but most worrying is the chief minister’s silence on it. He has not uttered a word on it. Pawar addressed two press conferences but the attempt was to cover things up. The Congress does not seem to exist. They have not taken a stand; they say something else in Delhi and toe a completely different line here. What is their share in all of this for their silence?” Fadnavis asked. “The government has shown no leadership. Despite such a huge racket being exposed, the one who exposed it, action has been taken against that official, but no action has been initiated against those who carried out the racket. This government has given up democracy and is doing as it pleases. It’s collecting haftas, indulging in transfer racket... It is not focused on tackling the corona crisis. It is time for action, not speeches. Our colleague Sudhir Mungatiwar has brought 100 incidents to the notice of the governor where the Constitution has been violated,” Fadnavis said. Reacting to Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut’s statement terming the expose as a “lavangi fataka,” Fadnavis said, “Whether it is a ‘lavangi fataka’ or atom bomb will be revealed soon. Why are they so frightened then? If it’s a ‘lavangi fataka’ then why was it kept under wraps since August 2020? Who are these people who are running the racket, receiving the money and who would be exposed because of this report? To protect these people, this report was kept secret. The truth will be out soon,” he said. On the accusation that a police officer was a BJP agent, Fadnavis said, “If an officer speaks the truth then that officer is a BJP agent and if the officer collects hafta, then is he a Shiv Sena agent? All of them are together in this hafta vasooli.” Fadnavis said he had exposed the racket for the good of Maharashtra, and if the government wants to register a complaint, it should file a complaint against him. “I shall go to court and prove the accusations I have made,” he said. Meanwhile, Nana Patole, state Congress president, told mediapersons on Wednesday evening that a delegation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi would meet Governor B S Koshyari on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-team-urges-governor-to-send-a-report-to-centre/articleshow/81677074.cms||---

The accused has been arrested, while a search is on for his associate. A video of the incident was uploaded on Facebook after which police traced the victim, who belongs to a minority community, and a case was registered. The accused thrashing the victim, Salman, was identified as Ajay Goswami, a resident of Old Garhi village, who runs a dairy in the area. Goswami had earlier been arrested in a northeast Delhi riots case and was out on bail. In the video, Goswami was seen thrashing the victim and asking him to chant “Hindustan Zindabad” and “Pakistan Murdabad”. The victim chanted the slogans and pleaded not to be thrashed. DCP (Northeast) Sanjay Sain said, “Once the viral video came to our notice, we took cognisance and sent a team to track the victim and the suspect, who were eventually identified on Wednesday. Goswami was arrested, while his associate Deepak, who was recording the video, is absconding. A case of voluntarily causing hurt and wrongful restraint has been registered at Khajuri Khas police station.” An initial investigation by the cops has revealed that Salman was caught allegedly trying to sneak inside Goswami’s dairy. However, police are yet to verify this and no case was registered against him till late on Wednesday. Police said the victim was also a criminal and involved in cases of robbery and murder.

Amarinder, who has also sought time from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a meeting on the issue, sought his personal indulgence to issue appropriate directions to the ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution, to defer implementation of the scheme for at least one year. The arhtiyas and farmers have long-standing relations, he pointed out, questioning the need to change the system when it was working very well. Around 50% farmers give their land on contract, so how will those who till the land get their money under DBT, said Amarinder at a media event. In his letter, Amarinder drew the Prime Minister’s attention to the ministry’s directions to Punjab to ensure direct payment to farmers along with online submission of details of landowners and cultivators. Pointing to the age-old relationship that Punjab has between arhtiyas, who are licencees under the Agriculture Produce Market Committee Act 1961, and farmers, noted that for the past many decades, the state procurement agencies and FCI have been procuring foodgrains for the central pool. Farmers have never complained of non-receipt of payment of MSP, and the state government is ensuring online payment to farmers, albeit through these arhtiyas, he said. Amarinder added that the land ownership and tenancy issues may give rise to various avoidable legal complications, especially during the ongoing farmers’ agitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-cm-to-pm-hold-dbt-scheme-for-farmers-for-year/articleshow/81677071.cms||---

---||Delhi||Registrar issue on JNU EC agenda||New Delhi: A day after JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) alleged that the appointment of the new JNU registrar Anirban Chakraborti was “illegal”, a related item was added in the agenda for the executive council (EC) meeting on March 26. “The EC may approve relieving Pramod Kumar from the university service and the action taken by the VC,” the agenda item 4.7 reads. The teachers’ association claimed that the move was triggered by their March 24 letter. In a statement issued on March 24, the teachers’ association had stated that the Statute 8(1) of University rules categorically states that the ‘registrar shall be appointed by the EC’. “There has been no Executive Council meeting where the EC has deliberated on the matter or approval for this decision has been specifically sought. The newly appointed registrar’s backdoor entry into the EC by a fiat issued by the vice-chancellor therefore is not just suspect but also illegal.” JNUTA on Thursday alleged that “the post facto inclusion of the item in the agenda appears to be clearly an afterthought, following the widespread reporting in the media of the gross illegalities committed by the caretaker VC.” Despite repeated attempts, the VC and the new registrar did not respond to TOI’s requests for a comment on the matter. The university administration had recently criticised JNUTA for referring to Kumar as the “caretaker VC” and said that according to the JNU Act and its statutes, there was no such nomenclature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/registrar-issue-on-jnu-ec-agenda/articleshow/81696360.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Can’t slash SSC, HSC syllabi any further: State’s edu min||Nagpur: School education minister Varsha Gaikwad ruled out any more cuts in SSC and HSC syllabi, citing logistical issues. In a public statement issued on Wednesday, Gaikwad said the state education board had already slashed 25% of the syllabi and now ‘there’s not enough time’. “Many parents and students wonder why we can’t cut it by an additional 25%, effectively reducing the syllabi by half. Everyone needs to understand that the state government requires at least four months to start preparing for board exams. If any changes are made now, then we will be off the schedule by months and that will be detrimental to students,” said Gaikwad. Since reduction of syllabi means question papers will again have to be set, and that will push the time needed for printing over a crore of questions papers. With almost 30 lakh students appearing for both SSC and HSC exams, with an average of five subjects, the number of copies to be printed and distributed securely is a major logistical challenge. Gaikwad said, “We have been consistently taking student-friendly initiatives. Last year, we started with reduction of syllabi by 25%. Now the current exam will be held under new guidelines, which include increase in paper duration.” Principals of schools, however, were not convinced. A senior academic, who did not wish to be named,said “I think the government misjudged the Covid-19 effect. Around November and December they were convinced that Covid-19 is gone, school attendance is rising sharply so there’s no further need to reduce the syllabi. And that’s how they stuck with the 25% cut. The government knows they have committed a blunder by not reducing it further, but now it’s too late. Hence all these sops of increased timings etc.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cant-slash-ssc-hsc-syllabi-any-further-states-edu-min/articleshow/81677082.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

After registering an FIR, police in Etah launched the operation to arrest the three accused policemen including Kotwali Dehat station house officer (SHO) Indreshpal Singh, constables Santosh Kumar and Shailendra Kumar. All the three are under suspension and missing. They have been booked under IPC section 384 (punishment for extortion), 211 (false charge of offence made with intent to injure), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) and section 7/13 of the prevention of corruption act. Additional director general of police (ADG) of Agra zone, Rajeev Krishna, had ordered a probe.The eatery owner, Praveen Kumar Yadav, had alleged that on March 4, the two constables had refused to pay Rs 400 bill after eating food. “They were offering only Rs 80. My elder brother requested them to pay at least Rs 200. Some of the customers also asked them to pay the bill. Following an argument, the policemen started beating my brother. They were drunk and threatened to send us to jail.” Yadav said that after the argument, constables left the eatery at Agra Road. “Soon, 15 policemen arrived and took my brother and cousin along with eight costumers to Kotwali Dehat police station and registered an FIR against them.”In the FIR, they alleged that the 10 people were part of an organized gang and were hatching a plan for loot. Police also claimed that they were held following an encounter. They also showed country-made pistols and liquor in recovery.After initial investigation conducted by ASP Kumar, it came out that SHO Singh had shown fake recovery in connivance with liquor mafia Bantu Yadav. However, he was not named in the FIR. According to sources, Bantu was booked under the Gangster Act by Etah police in 2017. He has several other criminal cases pending against him. IG Piyush Mordia said, “Role of Bantu is under investigation. His name will also be added to FIR.

Es karke jaag jaayo, na saade naal sharata karo, Punjab nal te Punjab de kisan naal (if Bhagat Singh can sacrifice his life the country, then same Bhagat Singh can even hurl a bomb in this assembly. So be warned, don’t play games with us, neither with Punjab not Punjab’s farmers),” he said. Earlier, Bittu was speaking against changes in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act and direct bank transfer scheme for farmers in the Parliament. During his address, he said, “Punjab’s biggest festival, Baisakhi, is approaching fast, but the Centre does not want us to celebrate it because 15 lakh farmers and their families are looking desperately towards it (Union government) because 40 years’ old APMC Act of our state has been ordered to be changed. How can it be that a law, based on which the relations of our farmers and arhtiyas (commission agents) have remained cordial for 40 years, is changed? How can the farmers adapt to changes like computerisation of records and feeding of data when procurement season in Punjab is starting next week?” Bittu, who is Congress’s leader in the Lok Sabha, claimed that the new changes had been introduced by the Centre with the aim of creating a rift between farmers and commission agents, and also taking revenge from Punjab farmers for not accepting the three agro-market laws. He said the Centre’s adamant attitude on the issue of farm laws was taking lives of Punjabis who gave so many sacrifices for the nation. In the day, Bittu also launched an attack against the Centre for raising rates of petrol, diesel and LPG, and criticised finance minister for not addressing this concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bhagat-can-throw-bombs-in-assembly/articleshow/81677087.cms||Mohit Behl

Also, all required construction in the temple will now take place in a time-bound manner, say officials. Dilip Jawalkar, secretary, tourism, Uttarakhand, said that an MoU will soon be inked with SLREF Foundation for the adoption of the temple. “This is an important scheme of the central government under which important heritage sites are adopted by private individuals/institutions to ensure their maintenance. As per the MoU, the ministry of tourism, Government of India, will be the first party; Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board (UTDB) will be the second party; director general, culture, uttarakhand would be the third party and SLREF will be the fourth party,” added Jawalkar. The tourism department is also planning to pitch important heritage sites of Uttarakhand such as — Gartang Gali-Nelong Valley, Pithoragarh Fort, Chansilibaganan area, Chaurasi Kutia, Sati Ghat, and Narainkoti temple — under the ‘Adopt a Heritage’ project. The authorities of the UTDB have called upon private institutions/organisations to come forward and take up the responsibility of the maintenance of these important heritage sites and ensure their contribution in strengthening the local economy by creating better tourism facilities in the state. “Such schemes will not only help us take care of the heritage sites but also create employment opportunities. Locals will get opportunities as guides and taxi drivers, through homestays and in providing food services. This will strengthen the local economy and make Uttarakhand an ideal destination for heritage tourism,” added Jawalkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/narainkoti-temple-to-be-adopted-under-central-govts-scheme/articleshow/81676077.cms||Ishita Mishra

A bench of Justices S P Deshmukh and Girish Kulkarni heard a PIL by BJP leader and activist Chitra Wagh for registration of an FIR, a probe by a special investigation team (SIT) and/or transfer to CBI “for proper and fair investigation’’ in the “'unfortunate case” of the 22-year-old, who was a TikTok star. On February 8, 2021, the woman allegedly died by suicide. The petition said the matter requires thorough investigation in view of audio clips containing conversations of “high-ranking political figures” and added that “despite a huge public uproar and resignation of a minister, the authorities failed to initiate investigation in accordance with law”. Senior advocate Atul Damle, for Wagh, argued that the state director-general of police said it would be treated as crime and investigations would be conducted. “Since February no action is taken. They must tell what they are doing,’’said Damle, pointing out that transcripts of the tapes have gone viral. He said police can verify their authenticity. Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare questioned the local standi of Wagh and said no family member of the woman had come forward. He said Wagh can approach police or a magistrate under CrPC. “Why FIR is not lodged?’’ asked Justice Kulkarni. The judge told Thakare to respond..

Calling governor B S Ko-shyari a ‘BJP family member’, he said: “So, opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis and other leaders meeting with the governor was like a family gathering.” Speaking on Fadnavis’s allegations that Thackeray chose not to act on a report on the alleged police transfers racket, Raut told TOI: “The CM will speak at the right time...they [BJP] do not have any atom bomb, rather a damp firecracker which does not even have a wick...” On the Fadnavis-Koshyari meet, he said, “They all are official BJP workers. Some are in the state administration and some in Raj Bhavan (governor’s official residence). So, it was like a family gathering...The governm-ent is run by the CM, and not the governor. If they [BJP leaders] had met the CM, submitted the documents... it would have help-ed to have a good dialogue between the two...Till yesterday, Koshyari was a RSS pracharak, the CM of a BJP-ruled state, and held a Union minister’s post as a BJP member. So, is it an insult to call him a BJP worker? If someone says I am a Shiv Sena worker, I would proudly say, ‘Yes, I am’.” Raut reiterated that home minister Anil Deshmukh will continue to remain in the post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cm-will-speak-at-right-time-guv-from-bjp-family/articleshow/81677106.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Nagpur||Working from Pune, biodiversity board official claimed allowances for city office||Nagpur: Even as the Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board (MSBB), having its headquarters at Nagpur, has got a new chairman after 14 months, the board was virtually defunct as its affairs were handled from Pune by sitting member-secretary and PCCF Jeet Singh. Singh was posted at MSBB on June 1, 2019. However, settled in Pune for the last 15 years on various forest department posts, he ran a parallel sub-office of MSBB from Pune but availed all benefits like peon allowance, telephone allowance, newspaper allowance and TA bills which are entitled to being at headquarters. Singh used to visit Nagpur at month-ends to take his salary. “During that 8-month Covid period, MSBB staff used to go to Jalna to get documents signed from Singh where he used to come from Pune. On administrative matters, the staff used to send papers on his personal e-mail address,” said sources. According to a series of complaints by contract employees to the forest secretary and others, though Singh claimed all the allowances, as per the GR, a mandatory certificate is required to be given for reimbursement about the installation of landline, internet facility at the official residence. As Singh doesn’t have an official accommodation at Nagpur, these allowances should not have been claimed. “Though Singh has been transferred to Nagpur about 1.5 years ago, he also did not vacate his official quarter at Pune, which has to be vacated after three months of taking over the new posting,” said the complaint. Owing to the NGT ruling making mandatory preparation of people’s biodiversity register (PBR), a document of biodiversity in gram panchayats, mandatory, the board prepared over 28,650 PBRs in three months without any public consultation and paid on an average Rs 20,000 to 1.15 lakh per PBR to biodiversity management committees (BMCs). Now, these PBRs are gathering dust and there is no staff to cross-check these PBRs. There are only three employees in the MSBB. As the board was defunct, many PhD students were not given the board’s permission for research works for flora and fauna. Only 2-3 applications were approved. The board is also losing crores of rupees towards access benefit sharing (ABS) from various manufacturing companies whose activities are based on natural resources. Such companies get registered with the MSBB office at Nagpur and pay a royalty to the board on the basis of their production. However, Singh refuted all the allegations. “The 8-9 contractual staffers are frustrated as I’ve removed them due to lack of funds. The board has no money to pay their salaries. We received Rs 47 lakh only in 2020-21, which is meagre sum to run the board. “There is no corruption of even Rs 10 in the MSBB. If proved, I’m ready to resign. I operated from Pune because there is a board office there and hence there is no problem in claiming allowances. With biodiversity being a big subject, 50% of the work is in Western Maharashtra,” said Singh. On the ABS issue, Singh said, “There is a court order hence we can’t take any cohesive action in the matter against companies. For the past one-year, the MSBB was not in existence and hence my role was limited. Now, the chairman has been appointed and we will work systematically.” On PBRs, Singh said, “It is true that preparing PBRs is an exhaustive process but had we not prepared these PBRs, the NGT would have imposed a fine of Rs 10 lakh per month. Hence, these were prepared hurriedly. We don’t have staff to scrutinize these PBRs.” WHAT HAPPENED · City-based MSBB headquarters got new chairman after 14 months · Its affairs were handled from Pune by sitting member-secretary and PCCF Jeet Singh · Singh was posted at MSBB on June 1, 2019 · In Pune for the last 15 years, he ran a parallel sub-office of MSBB · Availed benefits like peon allowance, telephone allowance, newspaper allowance and TA bills entitled only at the headquarters · Used to visit Nagpur at month-ends to take salary · MSBB staff used to go to Jalna to get documents signed from Singh where he used to come from Pune||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/working-from-pune-biodiversity-board-official-claimed-allowances-for-city-office/articleshow/81677089.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

It says that the second Covid-19 peak is likely to be more severe. A doctor, who is a part of it, says the study has been done by preventive and social medicine department of CMCH and is to be shared with the government only. “As per the mathematical calculations, the peak in the state in general and Ludhiana in particular will remain till about April 6, after which there are chances of cases declining. But the decrease is likely to be slow and not drastic,” he adds. “The calculations show that Ludhiana can witness a peak this and the next week till around April 6. As of now, it appears that the daily cases may break the last record,” he says. The CMCH official says the graph will depend largely on the way the authorities enforce restrictions. “Closing of schools will help check spurt in cases. People should come forward and get themselves tested. It is not right to keep it a secret,” he adds.A senior doctor at CMCH says people should not lower their guard.“Coronavirus is a threat and it will affect children and younger population also. So, everyone needs to take care of themselves and each other by wearing a mask and following Covid appropriate behaviour. Those with symptoms should report to the nearest health institution, get themselves tested and self-isolate themselves till their reports come. Wearing a mask is a sewa (service). Punjabis are known for sewa, so they should do it,” says Dr Clarence Samuel, head of the department of preventive and social medicine.Sept 16 saw highest case surgeDuring the previous year, the highest number of cases in a day in Ludhiana were reported on September 16, when the count was 562. A day later, 513 cases were reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/daily-covid-cases-likely-to-surpass-the-previous-high-cmch-study/articleshow/81675242.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Ludhiana||City gets app to help find lost, stolen vehicles||Ludhiana: Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal, on Wednesday, launched a mobile application, PP-VFS, to facilitate people find their lost / stolen vehicles. Police said the app has been designed to address several issues. “Sometimes, a stolen vehicle is recovered from the jurisdiction of some other police station or another district. The complainants find it difficult to know the status unless police contact them. And at times, the number plates are removed or changed and vehicles are sold multiple times, making it tough for police to trace the actual owner. A large number of vehicles are lying at police stations for want of identification of the owners. Data of about 1,500 such vehicles has been entered in this app,” said police.The app will help people find out whether their stolen vehicle has been recovered by any of the police stations. “PP-VFS stands for Punjab police vehicle finder system. People can search their vehicle through registration, engine or chassis number. There is an advanced search system in the app that enables search by vehicle make, model and colour, too,” they added.Ludhiana police said the app could be downloaded for Android phones from Google Play Store. The link for it is https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=punjabpolice.saanjh.com.vehicle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/city-gets-app-to-help-find-lost-stolen-vehicles/articleshow/81675254.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||State agrees to repeal 1 of 4 laws Centre suggested||Thiruvananthapuram: The Centre has recommended the state to repeal four acts as part of reducing the number of legal compliances. The acts include the 140-year-old Deccan Agriculturists’ Relief Act, 1879, the Kerala Panchayat Raj (Profession tax) Rules, 1996, Kerala Electricity Duty Act, 1963, and State Fire Safety Act.According to reliable sources in the government, while the state has agreed to repealing the 140-year old act, objections were raised with regard to repealing the remaining three laws, as that would affect the government’s revenue. The Deccan Agriculturists’ Relief Act, 1879, was originally enacted to provide succour to indebted farmers in certain parts of Deccan region, that was extended to the state as well. The Centre has suggested that since the state has a separate debt relief law, the purpose of this act has been subsumed by other laws. However, since the competent legislature for the subject of agricultural indebtedness is the state, the Centre sought the state’s permission to repeal it. It is reliably learnt that the agriculture department has given nod for repealing the act, and since it is a central legislation, the state has said that the Centre can take necessary steps to repeal it. However, the state is not in favour of repealing the concerned portion in the municipality and panchayat acts, dealing with profession tax, which is levied and collected by the commercial taxes department of the state. A person earning an income from salary or anyone practicing a profession such as chartered accountant, company secretary, lawyer, doctor, etc, are required to pay professional tax. It is a source of revenue for the local bodies. Since local bodies have very few revenue sources left, repealing this act would result in revenue loss for local bodies, the state feels. The state is also not in favour of repealing the Kerala Electricity Duty Act, 1963. According to the Centre, charging electricity duty may result in exodus of industrial units, and hence, this law must be repealed. The suggestion of the fourth act, is still under discussion of the home department. The State Fire Safety Act, which provides norms for the maintenance of fire and emergency services and to make more effective provisions for fire prevention and fire-safety measures in various types of buildings and premises in the state, is being felt as redundant in the wake of the new National Building Code. As per the Centre, such laws should be uniform for all states, rather than a separate law for every state, and so the building code should be the magna carta of the fire and rescue departments. The suggestions by the department of promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) is part of identifying the compliance burden for citizens, and to simplify them to make such services more people-friendly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/state-agrees-to-repeal-1-of-4-laws-centre-suggested/articleshow/81676157.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Chandigarh||Guv must explain bill delay: Captain||Chandigarh: Terming the growing economic and military ties between Pakistan and China as New Delhi’s “failure of diplomacy”, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said by delaying resolution on farmers’ crisis, the BJP-led government at the Centre was allowing Pakistan to take advantage of dissatisfaction emerging in the state. Urging the Centre to repeal farm laws in the interest of the nation’s security, if for no other reason, the chief minister asked, “Have you not thought of what Pakistan will do in this scenario?” Warning that the two neighbouring countries will take advantage of dissatisfaction among youth in Punjab, as they had done in the pas, he stressed on the need to “learn from history”. Is Delhi sleeping?” he said, citing figures on increase in arms smuggling into Punjab through drones since the farmers had intensified their stir. Amarinder rejected the suggestion that the state amendment bills against the farm laws were symbolic in nature. bills were passed under Article 354 (II) of the Constitution as was done by Gujarat for the land acquisition laws, he said. “The governor should explain what is stopping him from sending the bills to the President,” said the CM, adding that if they go to the President and he refused to give his assent, his government would move Supreme Court. tnn Asserting that he stood with farmers, and his heart was with them, Amarinder said if farmers, who had so far opposed any political interference, approached him for intervention, he would be happy to suggest a solution to the current crisis. He again urged the central government not to sit on ego or prestige, but to withdraw farm laws immediately. “This is not Hitler’s Germany or Mao Zedong’s China. People’s will has to be heard,” he said, adding that those at the helm should understand that the agitation was not political, but a matter of farmers’ survival. Pointing to his 52 years of experience in politics, Amarinder said he had seen the build-up of terrorism, and also the assassination of a chief minister of Punjab. The situation was worse today because of economic and military collusion between Pakistan and China, which was “very ominous for India”, he said, at a media event. “While the Indian Army is equipped to handle any situation, the question is why the Indian government is allowing the country’s two big enemies to get together?” he said. If there is a war, Pakistan and China will be in it together, and Punjab, which shares a 600-km long border with Pakistan, will be at the battlefront, he said. He warned against trusting Pakistan Army chief General Bajwa’s offer of peace, terming it Islamabad’s double-faced policy. “Pakistan has been at our throats since 1947, how can they bury the past?” he said. “Bajwa is, in fact, not fit to be an Army man; he is a liar,” said Amarinder, adding that the day the general made the peace offer seven encounters happened at the borders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/guv-must-explain-bill-delay-captain/articleshow/81677103.cms||---

According to the plan, vehicles would travel via Khadki Bazaar Road after crossing the Harris bridge. They can be back on the old Pune-Mumbai highway from the Khadki police station chowk. The traffic from Shivajinagar towards Bopodi would continue to ply on the old highway.The MahaMetro (Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited) said it had received the necessary permission from the traffic police department to go ahead with the work with the diversion in place. Officials from MahaMetro stated that the work was likely to continue for the next couple of months. The work of laying foundation, construction of pillars and other Metro-related works would be expedited during the closure, a MahaMetro official said.The commuters from the Khadki Bazaar area demanded deployment more police personnel at key chowks to avoid traffic snarls. Local MLA Siddharth Shirole recently visited the entire stretch and discussed the diversion plan with the police and residents of the area. He said, “All the issues would be addressed in the next couple of days. The police have been told to ensure minimum obstructions to the traffic during the rush hours.”The vendors from Khadki Bazaar area feared loss in business because of the diversion. They demanded some relaxations for the residents of the area.More police personnel have been deployed to manage the traffic.

The case was registered on the complaint of Sham Sundar, inspector of the anti-evasion wing of Central GST (CGST) commissionerate, Ludhiana. Joint commissioner of police Deepak Parekh said, “We have registered the FIR against Sahil Jain, a businessman and resident of Sundar Nagar, and others under sections 177, 199, 200, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471, 474 and 120-B of the IPC.”Jain has been summoned to appear before the court on March 26 in fake sureties case. Jain was booked and arrested by CGST on November 11 last for bogus billing of Rs 393 crore. He had committed the financial crime by operating multiple firms in his, family members’ and friends’ names and issued invoices without the actual supply of goods. In the course of hearing of the CGST case, Jain was granted bail on January 11 upon furnishing of two sureties of Rs 1 crore and bank guarantee or FDR of Rs 50 lakh. But the CGST department found the papers forged as the two men who were shown as sureties gave a statement before the department that they did not know Jain and never gave any kind of surety for his bail. The CGST department not only brought the matter to the knowledge of the court, but also filed a police complaint, seeking action against the accused for furnishing false information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bizman-others-booked-for-giving-forged-sureties/articleshow/81675261.cms||Mohit Behl

The institute has been granted autonomy for 10 years — 2021-22 to 2030-31. Over 40 colleges under the university have autonomy now. The autonomous status conferred on the institute will help it float its own syllabus and customise it as per the cutting-edge global technical trends. The institute is keen on offering an employment-centric syllabus. Suresh Ukarande, college principal, said that they will be able to teach from the latest and relevant technologies with experts from various industries and even academicians. “In an unconventional approach, learners can also choose from a wide range of elective subjects from other branches...,” he said. “In the post-pandemic scenario, competitiveness in the industry will entail graduates to possess proficient technical and management relevant skill sets. The autonomous freedom comes with a responsibility to balance practical training and a curriculum outlined to meet the job market dynamic needs.” The institute also plans to promote community service. While many of the Somaiya institutes on the Vidyavihar campus now come under the private Somaiya Vidyavihar University, this institute is in Sion and is still affiliated to Mumbai University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-somaiya-is-7th-of-mus-engg-colleges-to-get-autonomy/articleshow/81677669.cms||---
---||Pune||Residents of Kamgar Putala to get homes at alternative sites||Pune: Over 600 slum dwellers from the Kamgar Putala area in Shivajinagar will get houses at alternative locations as part of a lottery of homes, scheduled next week. The slum dwellers are being shifted to vacate the land for the Metro project.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) had held discussions with the slum dwellers about allotment of homes and completion of formalities in the last two months. The Metro work in the Kamgar Putala area had been delayed because the rehabilitation process was yet to get over. The land was required for three Metro lines — two being executed by MahaMetro and the other by the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA). Initially, the slum dwellers refused to shift from the Kamgar Putala area to other locations. The locals demanded rehabilitation within the vicinity, which was not feasible due to various technical grounds, a civic official said. The issue was taken up with the deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who had told the officials to work out a solution amicably. “For the last three months, we have been working on the rehabilitation proposal. Initially, we invited applications, following which talks were held with the families and the required formalities were completed. Around 847 names are being considered. Of these, the lottery will be held for 600 beneficiaries. They will get houses either in Vimannanagr or Hadapsar,” a PMC official said.The families are going to get houses of 25sq mtr. The buildings for rehabilitation are ready, an official said. Around 250 people have still not completed the process. The SRA will deal with all these cases by holding talks.The officials are looking forward to completing the rehabilitation process next month. The land will be handed over for the Metro work after the families are shifted. Two Metro lines, constructed by MahaMetro — Vanaz-Ramwadi and PCMC-Swargate — are meeting near Kamgar Putala. THe one constructed by the PMRDA is the Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar Metro line.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-of-kamgar-putala-to-get-homes-at-alternative-sites/articleshow/81676099.cms||---

Sources in the Congress said that the outline for the Bunkar Adhikar Yatra is being given a final shape at the office of party national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, while Ajai Rai, former five-times MLA, who also contested against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014, has done the required research work along with UPCC President Ajay Lallu in this regard. Slated for launch after Holi, the party will raise issues related to the weavers’ community in districts covering districts from Barabanki to Azamgarh. The final event will culminate into a programme in Varanasi which in all probability will be attended by Priyanka Gandhi. Nearly a dozen districts in the state have a significant weavers’ population. While in eastern UP, weavers mainly belong to the Muslim community those in the west are lower caste Hindus. In its bid to revive the party organisation in UP particularly in the rural sides, the Congress has decided to hold the bunker adhikar yatra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cong-to-woo-weavers-with-bunkar-yatra/articleshow/81677649.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Tamshettiwar, who had attended the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS) in which Hosabale was elected the new sarkaryavah, was briefing journalists in the city about the developments. Sarkaryavah is responsible for the day-to-day decisions in the RSS. Both the sarsanghchalak (chief) and sarkaryavah are stationed at Nagpur, which is also the RSS headquarters. “At present, Hosabale’s headquarters will remain at Lucknow. A decision to shift it to Nagpur would be taken eventually. This means Hosabale’s mailing address will remain RSS’s Lucknow office. However, this is just a formality,” Tamshettiwar told TOI. “Even administrative base of Mohan Bhagwat remained Kolkata for nearly two years after he became the sarkaryavah,” he said. Bhagwat later shifted to Nagpur. “The reshuffling of bases would happen soon. Even Hosabale would be coming to Nagpur, a decision on it would be taken in a few months or maybe a year,” he added. Giving details of the pratinidhi sabha meet at Bengaluru, Tamshettiwar said, “The first resolution taken in the meet was that construction of temple at Shri Ram Janmabhoomi is manifestation of innate strength of the country.” The month-long donation drive to collect funds for building the temple has got an overwhelming response throughout the country. In Vidarbha, over Rs57 crore was collected from more than 27 lakh families. This is much more than the expectations. “When the drive began, it was planned to contact 25 lakh families for getting the contribution. However, not only a larger number of people donated for the temple, but even the collections exceeded the target by Rs7 crore,” he said. Donations were received from villages in remote areas like Melghat and Gadchiroli also. Over 12,000 villages in Vidarbha were covered during the drive, said Tamshettiwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rss-gen-secy-elect-hosabale-may-soon-shift-to-ngp-hq/articleshow/81677117.cms||Shishir Arya

Tikait, speaking at a mahapanchayat at Meham Chaubisi Chabutra, said they planned to sit on Haryana-Delhi borders on all corners at least till the next winter as the central government had walked away from dialogue last winter and was likely to come on the discussion table next winter. On the new legislation for recovery of damages to property, passed in the state assembly amid huge pandemonium, Tikait said the first recovery should be made from chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar who dug national highways to prevent farmers from going to Delhi on NOvember 26 last year. “Let there be recovery made for destroying public property from Khattar, let there be an FIR against him under the new bill,” he added. Tikait said their demands included repeal of three agro-market laws and a new law on ensuring MSP. On a call given for a countrywide bandh on March 26, Tikait said it was the call given by Sanyukta Kisan Morcha and he appealed to shopkeepers, citizens and transporters to support them by keeping their establishments/activities shut for a day. On his visit to poll-bound West Bengal, he said they were appealing voters there to raise the demand of MSP for their crops to the ruling national party at Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tikait-dares-khattar-to-enter-hry-villages/articleshow/81677113.cms||Sat Singh

The district administration has appealed to patients and their families to raise their voice against such exorbitant charges.Aurangabad district logged an all-time single-day high of 1,791 new Covid-19 cases and 25 deaths on Tuesday, taking the total number of active cases to 12,949.Yogesh Dharashivkar, a private professional, who was searching for a hospital bed for his Covid-positive sister, said a few hospitals he contacted quoted a flat rate of Rs 9,500 for a bed. “My sister did not require an ICU bed. Any oxygen-supported bed would have sufficed. I looked for other options after hearing of these high rates,” he said. The district administration had appointed auditors at private hospitals to look into complaints of overcharging by private hospitals. Such grievance redressal authorities are to be present in all institutions even if the more private hospitals are roped in. Resident deputy collector of Aurangabad Anant Gavhane said patients or their families can take the help of the auditors at the time of admission too. “If the complaint does not get resolved, patients or their relatives can approach district administration or the Covid control room of the civic body,” he said.

The first incident occurred around 10.30am in Thergaon when a man claiming to be a police officer stopped a 73-year-old woman and took her to his seniors. “One of them told her that they were from the crime branch and asked the woman to keep her chain in purse,” an officer from the Wakad police said. While she was removing the chain, it got stuck in her hair. “One of the suspects then stole the chain worth Rs 1.6 lakh while pretending to help her,” the officer said. The second case occurred about two hours later near Dahanukar Colony in Kothrud where the suspects used a similar trick to steal a gold a chain worth Rs 60,000 from a 65-year-old woman. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/conmen-steal-two-gold-chains-worth-rs-2-2-lakh/articleshow/81676103.cms||---

All eligible persons must take the vaccine. At the same time, everyone, including those who have taken the vaccine shot, should follow Covid protocol as even a little ignorance can upset life forever,” the CM said at a programme on Wednesday. The CM also reiterated that the state was undertaking all possible steps to contain the pandemic but weakening the chain of infection was impossible unless every single person in the state wears mask, follows social distancing and washes hands with soap regularly. “Despite having a weak health infrastructure, UP’s management strategy especially tracking high-risk contacts helped the state step up the fight against the deadly coronavirus. This had become possible only because of effective health management and exemplary teamwork. But the momentum against the virus needs to be maintained at every level,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/all-eligible-persons-must-take-jabs-cm/articleshow/81677680.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Consultant picked for 1.6km Colaba-Nariman Point link plan||MUMBAI: The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority has finalised plans for a 1.6km-long sea-link connecting Nariman Point to Colaba. “The new bridge will overcome existing traffic problems and enable smooth travel,” said an MMRDA spokesperson. We have appointed a project management consultant (PMC), who will prepare a detailed project report (DPR), suggest alignment, conduct a traffic survey and study necessary permissions that need to be obtained for carrying out the project.” The 2+2 lane connector is likely to originate near NCPA and end at Cuffe Parade. It will ensure the completion of an effective ring road around Mumbai. Over a decade ago, Lea Associates had submitted a traffic survey report to the MMRDA, recommending the bridge. At present, there is only a single road -- Captain Prakash Pethe Marg -- connecting Nariman Point with Colaba. As a result, heavy traffic congestion, especially during peak hours, is reported almost daily. The PMC will undertake the tendering process and calculate the estimated cost of the project. There could be hurdles as the project is in a high security zone: the sea off the stretch is patrolled by the Coast Guard, and there is also heavy Navy presence. Environmental clearances will be required as there may be reclamation involved; there are concerns that work can endanger marine life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-consultant-picked-for-1-6km-colaba-nariman-point-link-plan/articleshow/81677733.cms||Manthank Mehta

Around 58 of the inmates were from Nagpur city, who had turned out to be headache for cops, as many of them had to be re-arrested for getting involved in various crimes. The arrests by the State ATS in the Mansukh Hiran murder case also included an accused who had been released on special leave from a prison in western Maharashtra. The HPC, following a decision of the Supreme court, had released around 11,000 inmates in the state to decongest prisons following the outbreak of Corona in the country last year. Nagpur Central Jail had released 541 inmates following the decision. As of now, 244 jail inmates and 89 personnel have tested positive despite the decongestion measure. The leave at first was for 45 days, but later it had been extended by one month at a time till now. With the Covid spike, there is likelihood of the leave further stretching for a couple of more months, said a highly placed source. “The inmates on special leave are supposed to visit local police stations periodically. They report their current whereabouts, activities and also inquire whether any fresh orders of the HPC have arrived for them,” said a jail official. City police chief Amitesh Kumar said special surveillance systems are in place for the jail released and also inmates on parole or furlough leaves. “We register offence and send them back to jail by getting their leaves cancelled if they are involved in any crime,” said the top cop. “We have surveillance list of 58 inmates who are out on special leave. They are being monitored,” said the CP. He added some of the inmates, who were on leave, had been found embroiled in criminal activities and hence action was initiated. The convicts with lesser serious offences were released, and not those with serious cases like MCOCA, narcotics, sexual assaults, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and so on. Among undertrials, only those booked under cases with punishment less than seven years, were considered. Though safeguards were taken, the involvement of many of these inmates in local crimes has raised concerns of the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/541-jail-inmates-on-special-covid-leave-to-remain-out-till-further-orders/articleshow/81677144.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Aurangabad||‘Mark containment zones in Aurangabad’||AURANGABAD: The state-level health authorities have stressed on the need to mark containment zones in the areas emerging as Covid-19 hotspots in Aurangabad and also pressed for the enforcement of strict restrictions in these zones. Dr Sudhakar Shinde, the CEO of Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY), in a review meeting held on Wednesday, asked the district administration to take the necessary steps at the earliest. “Large-scale prohibition on different activities within the containment zones can help contain the spread of Covid-19. Such a measure, along with a multi-pronged strategy involving effective contact-tracing and improved testing, can put a check on the rising number of cases,” he said. Notably, the central team that had assessed the Covid-19 situation in Aurangabad district on March 10, had wanted the option of containment zones explored. The health authorities here had said that mapping of Covid-19 cases in different parts would be carried out to identify large clusters of cases. Among other key instructions, Shinde has also stressed on the need to conduct a minimum of 10 RT-PCR tests per fresh Covid patient. “Both high-risk and low-risk contacts of positive patients must undergo testing without fail. It will help in breaking the chain of Covid infections,” he said. Shinde also said that private hospitals failing to reserve beds for Covid-19 patients as per the norms would face action. “As per the SOP, scrutiny of every death due to Covid-19 must be carried out. It must involve details right from the condition of the patient at the time of admission and treatment offered among crucial information,” he said. Stating that the government was committed to provide resources, including manpower and funds, to deal with the outbreak, MJPJAY chief said the government authorities should take proactive measures to beat the pandemic in 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mark-containment-zones-in-aurangabad/articleshow/81674530.cms||---

He branded them “traitors unworthy of using the state’s fields as backdrop”. He said, “International celebrities such as Rihanna tweeted in favour of the farmers, while these fake Punjabis who don turbans for shooting uttered not a word of support. And we called them brothers.” He has asked the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha to get after the government for the release of all the farmers and youth arrested in Delhi.

---||Lucknow||Made in UP, Covid animation series helping world fight against pandemic||LUCKNOW: ‘Super Villain Corona’, an animated video series made in Uttar Pradesh, has gone global and is helping individuals, governments and organisations across 20 countries in fight the coronavirus pandemic. The United Nations also re-posted a video on facemasks on its Facebook page on Monday. ‘Super Villain’ is a character which has been created to denote coronavirus which is on the prowl making people sick. Developed last year by Unicef (Uttar Pradesh) under an arrangement with the Yogi Adityanath government through departments of health and family welfare, women welfare, education, AYUSH and UP Police, the video series gives Covid-19 prevention messages such as importance of wearing masks, washing hands with soap regularly and maintaining social distance. Besides busting stigma related to the virus, it also gives messages like coronavirus is airborne, Covid-19 infection attacks the lung, and that early symptoms include mild fever or loss of smell and taste. “During a pandemic, it is critical to ensure that correct information is disseminated to the community in the shortest possible time. That’s why we came up with a completely visual film pack using an interesting personification device for the coronavirus. Every single film has undergone technical vetting and rigorous pretesting for comprehension,” said Ruth Lascano Leano, chief field officer of UNICEF, Uttar Pradesh. As expected, the package went viral organically. “An interim tracking of hashtags shows that the package received 31,17,488 video views, reached 1,24,98,187 people and had 2,42,687 engagements in less than three months. The films are still being shown on LED screens in many cities of UP and also in Delhi,” a health official said. With cases on the rise ahead of festive season and panchayat elections, experts believe that it is time to bring the mascot back into action. “Being free from any particular language is the film’s biggest strength. Crisp storytelling makes it engaging while simple presentation makes it relatable. These three things made it popular across boundaries of demography and geography,” said Vivekananda Roy Ghatak who, along with his friend Gautam Singh, developed the series. The duo are from the National School of Design, Ahmedabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/made-in-up-covid-animation-series-helping-world-fight-against-pandemic/articleshow/81677746.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Pune||Colleges drag their feet, post-matric scholarship numbers at 11-year low||PUNE: Red tape and a lack of will among colleges have led to a massive drop in the application for post-matric scholarships offered by the state and Union governments. Since students do not end up getting the benefit of the scholarship, the number of applications has dropped from 2.6 lakh in 2019-20 academic year to just over 15,000 in 2020-21 academic year in Maharashtra, a right to information plea filed by Student Helping Hand, a students’ union, has revealed. The scheme awards scholarships to meritorious students belonging to economically weaker sections of the minority community so as to provide them better opportunities for higher education, increase their rate of attainment in higher education and enhance their employability. Ten years ago, in the 2011-12 academic year, over four lakh students benefitted from it, but gradually the number of beneficiaries have dropped. In 2020-21, scholarship takers were at a new low. The allocation for the post-matric scholarship which includes diploma and professional courses after HSC, was Rs 375 crore in the 2020-21 academic year, but only about Rs 38.7 crore was utilised. Many students have used the scholarship for higher education and foreign education. The scholarship also covers technical and vocational courses in Industrial Training Institutes/ Industrial Training Centres affiliated with the National Council for Vocational Training of standards XI and XII level, including polytechnics and other courses. No information given on rejection of applications President of students’ union Kuldeep Ambekar said the academic year has ended long ago. Yet, this year only about 15,600 students have received their scholarship. “I was not even given information about how many applications were received by the state social welfare department and how many of them were rejected,” he said. Ambekar said if the past five year figures are to be considered, the applications are declining and it is only because of the numerous problems students face during the process, colleges not cooperating by not forwarding the applications,and also the application portal that is always having problems. “The beneficiaries never get the scholarship amount in the current academic year. They always get it two to three years later. These scholarships are a great support to minority students and it helps in completing their higher studies,” he added. Some disbursal soon, say social welfare officials When contacted, commissioner of the state social welfare department Prashant Narnaware, said it was true that this year only 15,000 scholarships have been disbursed. “There were some technical issues with the scholarship portal and hence the disbursement had stopped. In the coming two to three days, we will be disbursing another 40,000 scholarships to the students who applied which will be the second phase, and in the next few days, the verification of other applications would also be done and accordingly disbursed,” he said. Narnaware said many colleges were at a fault for the decline in the number of scholarship applications as they did not take enough interest. “We have issued show-cause notices to many colleges in the state asking them why had they not checked on eligible students to fill the form or followed up on the beneficiaries. It is noticed that they do not do the follow up on their own with their students. They could even subscribe to a bulk messaging system and send messages to students regarding the scholarship applications and improve the numbers.” Narnaware added that the department has held talks with many vice-chancellors in the state and had told them to create awareness about the scholarship among colleges and encourage them to ensure that eligible students take advantage of the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/colleges-drag-their-feet-post-matric-scholarship-numbers-at-11-year-low/articleshow/81676147.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Exemptions will be granted for a few hours to certain services like the public distribution system stores and other essential services. The announcement was met with opposition from people, some of whom gathered outside the district collector’s office here in the afternoon and raised slogans. After Nanded, Beed has become the second district in the Marathwada region to introduce such restrictions. Addressing a news conference on Wednesday morning, Beed district collector Ravindra Jagtap said the stricter restrictions would be implemented from March 26 to April 4.

Similar exemption has been given to lawyers, traders of seeds and agricultural-related services, media, fuel stations and LPG services. Jagtap said, “The increase or drop in Covid-19 cases is purely based on every individual’s behaviour in public or at public places. Fresh restrictions are aimed at breaking the chain increase in numbers.” He said cane cutters returning home from other districts will have to get themselves tested before entering Beed. Students appearing for examinations will have to carry identity proof. Exemptions are also in order for educational institutions hosting students for their exams. In Parbhani, the district administration has placed further restrictions in the form of a curfew from 7pm on Wednesday till 6am on April 1.

---||Lucknow||BJP reaches out to farmers via samvaad||Lucknow: The UP BJP has termed the ongoing farmers’ stir a ‘politically-driven’ protest but that has not made the party overlook the community as it has reached out to lakhs of farmers all over the state through its ‘kisan samvaad’ programmes held in 806 blocks of UP. The party, while planning its mass contact programmes to mark the four years of Yogi government in office, had ‘kisan samvaad’ programmes planned as a major event during the eight-day schedule. The event was meant to tell farmers what all the state government has done for them. Though the programmes were held for other target groups as well, like women, youth, street vendors and others, farmers were one of the considerable groups the party addressed as the `kisan samvaad’ programmes were held in 806 out of 826 blocks of the state, including the districts in western UP where the farmers’ resentment over the new farm laws has been most notable. “The programmes were held everywhere and nowhere did we get to see any protest by farmers. Why would there be a protest when Modi government and Yogi government has done so much for them?” said state general secretary of the party Amarpal Maurya. Again, the party office-bearers though said the mass contact programmes have nothing to do with campaigning for panchayat elections as similar programmes were planned in previous anniversaries of the government also, it’s the timing of the party’s campaign for panchayat elections and the completion of state government’s four years in office that has made the state BJP set an almost similar agenda for its election campaign and anniversary events. Because panchayat elections have farmers as the biggest set of voters the party’s mass contact programmes with the community, at this point of time, might bring dividends. In addition to `Kisan Samvaad’, programmes to highlight Yogi government’s schemes for women were held at 391 places and that for youth at 2,923 places. The mass contact programmes are going on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-reaches-out-to-farmers-via-samvaad/articleshow/81677782.cms||Neha Shukla

RR Bamane, extension officer at Indapur, said some 100 people were chosen for video creation and trained by tech-savvy teachers from across the state in creating good content for the students. “We have about 1,000 teachers and 20,000 students in the primary section. The school started online as usual on June 15 and children started watching the videos and learning. At the end of the week, we would send them assessment-worksheets via Google Forms which they would fill up and send back. Of the 15,000 children studying in classes I to IV in Indapur ZP schools, 11,000 would send in their completed worksheets which means we were successful in reaching these children. These worksheets were not sent to class I students, which means we had about 90% success rate,” Bamane said.The videos are uploaded on ‘Indapur Learn from Home’ YouTube channel and Bamane said many teachers would make these videos at night to avoid any disturbance. “This work was in addition to the daily work they had to do. To ensure that these videos had the least background noise, teachers would stay up after everybody in the family had gone to bed and then make the videos, edit and submit them. We also have published a book on the work done by teachers and put up QR codes of the videos it in,” said Bamane. Teachers across the state have been working hard to ensure that learning reaches the rural areas in a year when online schooling has posed many challenges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/indapur-zp-teachers-make-over-2k-self-learn-videos/articleshow/81676161.cms||Ardhra Nair

By Wednesday evening, the girls’ mother and younger brother were taken into custody for “honour killing”. The elder brother is absconding, police said. “Police asked how they died. Then, they said you must have been there, or your mother. I said she didn’t see anything either — she had gone looking for them. Then, they said your husband and mother-in-law strangled them to death. When I denied that, it was not possible, women cops beat me up with sticks,” the girls’ sister-in-law said. Kamal Singh Yadav, the SHO of Bisalpur Kotwali, under whose jurisdiction both the villages where they were from and where they were found lie, denied the allegation. Pilibhit SP Jai Prakash Yadav implicated the family. “It was a case of honour killing … We have collected evidence to prove this,” he told TOI on Wednesday evening. "Autopsy reports reveal the younger sister died by hanging and the elder sister died of strangulation." Asked why the police believed it was a case of honour killing, another senior cop told TOI that the girls had “continued to be in touch with their boyfriends” after their marriage had been arranged with other people. “We found out that one of the girl’s boyfriend was from a lower caste. The brothers found it humiliating. They killed their sisters and dumped the bodies. Many families in the area are aware of this. We also have eyewitnesses,” the cop added, on condition of anonymity. The girls had two brothers and two sisters. Their father had died six years ago. On Tuesday night, an FIR had been registered against an unidentified person for murder and causing disappearance of evidence. The elder brother’s complaint in the FIR stated, “My sisters had stepped out around 7pm on March 22 to answer nature’s call. When they did not come back for a long time, we started looking. The body of one of my sisters was found by the road around 9pm. We found the other body, hanging by a tree, around 7am the next day. We want this to be investigated.” The brother worked at a brick kiln, whose supervisor had been detained on Tuesday and was still in detention at the time of filing the report. The girls’ family had refused to conduct the funeral until the FIR was lodged. On Wednesday afternoon, amid tight police security, the two bodies were buried at their village. In videos of the excavation, the yellow tarpaulin-covered bodies are seen lying next to the spot where soil is being scooped out, right behind a huge pile of firewood. “Police had brought the wood to support the family and cremate the bodies,” a senior cop said. But the community’s rituals do not allow cremation of unmarried women who die; they have to be buried. Then, excavators were put to work since morning to expedite the burial. SP Yadav said, “The funeral was conducted in a peaceful atmosphere after the family members requested a burial."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/forced-to-confess-we-killed-them-says-kin-of-2-sisters-found-dead-in-up-village/articleshow/81675323.cms||Keshav Agarwal

Besides this, the new chairman is also expected to uphold the dignity of the commission by following merit-based and transparent recruitment process,” said the chief minister, while interacting with the mediapersons after the ceremony. He said one-time registration portal for group C and D category posts has been launched, paving the way for the youth to apply and submit fees on the portal only once. He said the state government has already announced to conduct a Common Eligibility Test (CET) by Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) for filling up different posts of group C and D categories. All these steps taken by the state government would not only bring about more transparency, but also speed up the recruitment process. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bhopal-singh-takes-oath-as-hssc-chief/articleshow/81677159.cms||---

BEST general manager Surendra Bagade has written to municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal seeking a go-ahead. “In order to augment revenue through non-tariff avenues, BEST had floated a tender for advertisement through kiosks on streetlight poles. The tender was awarded to Ms Prithvi for three years (2020-2023). Ms Prithvi had applied for BMC permission to install the kiosks, but the licence department has informed us the request is rejected in view of safety issues,” Bagade’s letter states. Bagade pointed out that BEST had implemented the safety measures suggested by the traffic police and that the kiosks would be installed at a height of 12 feet from ground level on streetlight poles. BEST officials said the illuminated kiosks were planned 25m away from traffic signals, junctions and traffic islands. “BEST is facing huge financial losses. The advertisement revenue through kiosks will be able to generate Rs 6-8 crore annually…I request you to grant permission to all agencies appointed by the BEST for display of advertisement through kiosks on streetlight poles,” states Bagade’s letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-advt-kiosk-project-nixed-best-stares-at-rs-24cr-loss/articleshow/81677786.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Kochi||P Rajeev, P T Thomas spar over flyover case||KOCHI: Palarivattom flyover became a topic of hot debate for P Rajeev, CPM state secretariat member and LDF candidate in Kalamassery, and UDF candidate in Thrikkakara and the sitting MLA P T Thomas during a ‘Meet the Press’ programme at Ernakulam Press Club. Thomas said that even though the Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala Ltd (RBDCK) had found structural damages in the Palarivattom flyover within a month of its inauguration, the LDF government intentionally delayed action to use it as a political weapon against UDF in the assembly polls. And when Rajeev condemned Thomas’s statement, saying that a senior leader like him should not justify corruption shamelessly, the friendly interaction programme heated up, keeping the election spirit. The programme was attended by Rajeev, Thomas and C G Rajagopal aka Muthu, the NDA candidate from Kochi constituency. All the three candidates campaigned for themselves during their addresses, highlighting issues in their respective constituencies. The debate kicked off when Thomas replied to a journalist on Palarivattom flyover, within Thrikkakara constituency. “Eighty percent work of the bridge was completed by the UDF government and the remaining work was completed during the LDF government rule. But within a month of its inauguration, RBDCK found issues with the structure and informed the government. But no action was taken then. They delayed action purposefully so that my friend Rajeev could use it as a campaign tool in Kalamassery against Ebrahim Kunju. There were several bridges constructed when Kunju was minister. If there is corruption, those behind them must be nabbed but it should not have been used as a political weapon with the name ‘Panchavadipalam’,” Thomas said. Replying to Thomas, Rajeev said it was the high court that used the term ‘Panchavadipalam’ while considering the Palarivattom flyover case.  “The corruption in the construction of the flyover is something that should not have happened in modern Kerala. Thomas, who is a senior Congress leader, should not justify corruption in an indecent manner by calling it a campaign tool. It became an issue and Kunju did not get to contest this because there was corruption in the construction,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rajeev-thomas-spar-over-flyover-case/articleshow/81676178.cms||---

A government spokesperson said that the land was located in Madanpur Khadar Village in Delhi’s Sarita Vihar and had been encroached for several years. First khasra number 612 was marked by the Head Works Division, Agra Canal, Okhla. Then the Jal Shakti department took action to free it from encroachment. “I wrote to the Delhi LG, the Delhi chief minister and leader of opposition about this issue. The LG gave us full support. Our team went to the site with JCBs and other machines and was accompanied by Delhi Police and a team from the local administration,” said Jal Shakti minister Mahendra Singh. He added that an anti-encroachment drive to free all other illegally occupied land in Delhi, belonging to the UP Government, will be taken up soon. “Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has issued orders to identify such land and take strong action against the encroachers. The UP irrigation department owns land in Okhla, Jasola, Madanpur Khadar, Aali, Saidabad, Jaitpur, MolarBand and Khajuri Khas,” he said. The spokesperson added that the government has set up an anti-land mafia task force to free public land of encroachment within the state. This task force has got freed over 67,000 acres of land. The government is using this land for public activity, giving priority to sports grounds which will be created by the sports department, the youth welfare department or for the MNREGS works. The government has also set up an online portal on which the anti-land mafia task force set up in various districts updates daily actions taken by them against those involved in illegal land deals and encroachment.

---||Bareilly||‘Miracle’ in jungle: 4 two-month-old tiger cubs rescued 12 days after mother’s death in UP||PILIBHIT: It is only when a tiger cub is eight months old that it can survive on its own. Any time before that, it needs its mother and can only go eight days without being fed. So, when officials of the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) found four cubs, two months old each, whose mother had died 12 days ago, they were both relieved and excited. On March 14, a field forest team found a two-day old carcass of a tigress and four cubs around it. But before the cubs could be rescued, they had strayed off and forest officials were worried — they could have fallen prey to other carnivores, been targeted by poachers or died of starvation. A combing operation was launched, with 25 camera traps installed around the area where the carcass had been found. But not one image came up, nor did anyone spot any cub. So, on March 18, the operation was abandoned. While tiger cubs can start eating meat when they are 40 days old, they continue to depend on their mother for food. Cubs this young were not expected to survive beyond eight days, according to wildlife veterinarians. Forest officials gave up. But on Wednesday morning, hope revived. “A forest patrol team saw pug marks of tiger cubs about 1km from the area where their mother had died,” deputy director of PTR Naveen Khandelwal said. “After a few hours of search, we found them alive and well, hiding within shrubs in the core forest’s Mala range.” While they are still trying to understand how the cubs went without food for so long, forest officials believe watering holes may have helped. “We had dug four watering holes for the cubs, which may have helped them stave off dehydration at least,” Khandelwal said. On Wednesday, after the rescue, they were hydrated with essential electrolytes and fed goat milk. “We did not, however, weigh them because we wanted to minimise contact. We didn’t want to frighten them too much with unfamiliar touch,” Khandelwal added. Now, they will be moved to the Lucknow zoo for better care. “But we will not keep them in zoo for too long. That would interfere with their wild nature,” chief wildlife warden of UP Pawan Kumar Sharma said. “We will release them into a rewilding enclosure soon, so they can adapt.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/miracle-in-jungle-4-tiger-cubs-2-months-old-rescued-12-days-after-mother-died/articleshow/81675356.cms||Keshav Agarwal
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra predicts 3 lakh active cases by April 4, alarming rise in deaths||MUMBAI: The public health department has projected that active cases in Maharashtra could exceed 3lakh by April 4, leading to a shortage of treatment facilities in several districts, especially Nagpur and Thane, if they do not scale up. Projections are based on the weekly average growth rate of nearly 1%. Future caseload is predicated on the current surge, but the forecast signals an alarming rise in fatalities, with toll spiralling beyond 64,000 over the next 11 days. As of Wednesday, the state had reported 2,47,299 active cases and 53,684 deaths. Using a cumulative case fatality rate of 2.27% -- a figure based on all deaths since the March 2020 outbreak – the department has arrived at 64,613 possible mortalities against a total caseload of 28,24,382. Effectively, it means a projection of up to 1,000 deaths a day over the next two weeks!  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); An expert speaking on condition of anonymity said a more accurate indicator for future deaths would have been the more recent weekly fatality rate that was under 0.5% in the third week of March. Covid death audit committee head Avinash Supe said weekly death rate has been under 1% since February. The disease appears to be less virulent now though more transmissible. “Death rates are low because patient management is better than what it was last year… but we have to ensure hospitals are not overwhelmed with patients,” he said.   Principal health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas has shared the projections with all districts in an apparent bid to forestall shortages. According to the numbers, the state has adequate non-oxygen beds, ICU beds and ventilators, but needs to be outfitted with nearly 4,000 more beds with oxygen support. Nagpur and Thane may prove unequal to the task unless they build up an inventory of beds in the thousands over the next 11 days.   Currently, over 41% of active cases are in hospital, of which 8% are critical and 0.71% are on ventilator. Going by the figures, active cases in Pune district will be highest at 61,125, followed by Nagpur (47,707) and Mumbai (32,927). A senior critical care physician said these were conservative projections as Maharashtra has added more than a lakh cases in the last 3-4 days. Vyas has said all bed allocation in Dedicated Covid Hospitals and Health Centres must be based on clinical condition of the patient and no other consideration. Those who have recovered and have no fever, cough for three days and have more than 95% oxygen saturation should be promptly shifted to stand-down Covid Care Centres, he said. Vyas said there should be four-hourly, six-minute walk tests and checking of oxygen and temperature so that deteriorating patients are picked up early.   Reacting to the warning, Thane collector Rajesh Narvekar said work has begun to add 3,000 beds in the next four days. “Several of our Covid centres that were shut down will be activated. Patidar Hall in Kalyan Dombivali and Dombivli gymkhana are also being active,” he said. A 1,000-bed DCHC in Bhiwandi readied last year but not commissioned will be activated as well. Nagpur municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said, "Around 250 beds were added in private hospitals in the last two days. More than 90 beds were made available at the government medical college and another 45 beds will be made available in government hospitals." Health minister Rajesh Tope said 85% of cases are treatable at home. The 80:20 formula of bed sharing by private hospitals, if fully implemented, will ensure there is no shortage in beds, he added. Vyas has also instructed that officers and staff involved in vaccination are kept separate from those for surveillance and containment. Immunisation centres must not get overcrowded, he warned, or they could become super spreaders venues. He also asked districts to ensure private hospitals do not block Covid vaccine doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-predicts-3-lakh-active-cases-by-apr-4-alarming-rise-in-deaths/articleshow/81677176.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The special court judge convicted 31 accused under Section 143 and 341 of the IPC and punished them by imposing a fine of Rs 3,500 each. It was the fourth conviction handed out by the court for public representatives ever since it was set up. Additional public prosecutor G Narayana, during the trial, produced witnesses to prove before the court that the accused had blocked the National Highway 765 on July 30, 2015. They staged a protest demanding Amangal be declared a drought-hit mandal. While raising their demand, they blocked the highway for sometime, which caused inconvenience to motorists. Following the protest, Amangal police had registered a case under Sections 143 (Unlawful assembly), 341 (wrongful restraint) of the IPC. The court, after hearing both the prosecution and defence, convicted the accused and directed them to pay penalty of Rs 3,500 each. If the accused fail to pay the penalty, then they would be imprisoned for five weeks. In the last two months, the special court had convicted four public representatives. BJP MLA Raja Singh was the only one to get one-year jail term, whereas the other three public representatives —Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy (Congress), Musheerabad MLA Muta Gopal (TRS) and Vamshichand Reddy (Congress) — were convicted by the court but they were punished by just penalty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/former-mla-30-others-convicted-for-blocking-nh/articleshow/81677794.cms||Srinath Vudali

The messages, aimed at discouraging underage drinking, drunken driving and promoting responsible consumption of liquor, will be printed in bright red on all bottles, meant for sale in UP. Bottles being sold at present carry the warnings ‘Don’t drink and drive’ and ‘Consumption of liquor is injurious to health’ but these are printed in tiny lettering at the back of bottles, often almost invisible in the midst of other details printed on the bottle, said an official, adding that often the colour of the font would be the same as the colour of the liquid which would make the print unreadable. Calling it a move similar to that of putting warnings on cigarette packets, additional chief secretary (excise) Sanjay Bhoosreddy said that the state government had started a drive to promote responsible consumption of alcohol under the latest excise policy, for which Rs 1 crore had been allocated in the budget as well. “All bottlers were given directions to print these messages prominently on all bottles meant for sale in UP. Printing of labels for the fresh stock which will be available in shops from April 1 has started in mid-March. This is applicable for liquor which is being bottled anywhere in the country but meant for sale in UP,” said Bhoosreddy. The stock of the previous year which will be rolled over to the new financial year already has two lines of warning printed on it. “Under the new excise policy, the government has made beer cheaper, done away with the roll over fee for stock from one financial year to the other and not increased excise duty on any brand. However, while making liquor more affordable and easy to access through shops in malls etc, it is also focussed on ensuring responsible consumption which is why this dedicated awareness drive is being launched,” said an official. On Tuesday, the government had declared the upper limit of liquor under various categories which can be stored at home legally. Keeping anything above that will require a person to purchase an annual licence for Rs 12,000 with a security deposit of Rs 51,000. From 44.6 litres, the limit for free storage of liquor under the new excise policy of 2021-22 has been reduced to 26.5 litres in a bid to crack down on illegal trade of liquor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/liquor-bottles-in-up-to-carry-responsible-drinking-msg/articleshow/81683813.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Kanpur||Liquor bottles in UP to carry ‘responsible drinking’ message||LUCKNOW: From April 1, any liquor you purchase in UP will carry three messages aimed at promoting responsible consumption of alcohol. The messages, aimed at discouraging underage drinking, drunken driving and promoting responsible consumption of liquor, will be printed in bright red on all bottles, meant for sale in UP. Bottles being sold at present carry the warnings ‘Don’t drink and drive’ and ‘Consumption of liquor is injurious to health’ but these are printed in tiny lettering at the back of bottles, often almost invisible in the midst of other details printed on the bottle, said an official, adding that often the colour of the font would be the same as the colour of the liquid which would make the print unreadable. Calling it a move similar to that of putting warnings on cigarette packets, additional chief secretary (excise) Sanjay Bhoosreddy said that the state government had started a drive to promote responsible consumption of alcohol under the latest excise policy, for which Rs 1 crore had been allocated in the budget as well. “All bottlers were given directions to print these messages prominently on all bottles meant for sale in UP. Printing of labels for the fresh stock which will be available in shops from April 1 has started in mid-March. This is applicable for liquor which is being bottled anywhere in the country but meant for sale in UP,” said Bhoosreddy. The stock of the previous year which will be rolled over to the new financial year already has two lines of warning printed on it. “Under the new excise policy, the government has made beer cheaper, done away with the roll over fee for stock from one financial year to the other and not increased excise duty on any brand. However, while making liquor more affordable and easy to access through shops in malls etc, it is also focussed on ensuring responsible consumption which is why this dedicated awareness drive is being launched,” said an official. On Tuesday, the government had declared the upper limit of liquor under various categories which can be stored at home legally. Keeping anything above that will require a person to purchase an annual licence for Rs 12,000 with a security deposit of Rs 51,000. From 44.6 litres, the limit for free storage of liquor under the new excise policy of 2021-22 has been reduced to 26.5 litres in a bid to crack down on illegal trade of liquor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/liquor-bottles-in-up-to-carry-responsible-drinking-msg/articleshow/81683808.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Considering a petition filed by ED seeking to quash the FIR during admission hearing on Wednesday, Justice VG Arun has however directed that no coercive proceedings, including arrest, should be taken against the ED officials on the basis of the FIR launched by crime branch until the court hears the case in detail on March 30. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor generals (ASGs) SV Raju and KM Nataraj represented ED’s Cochin zone deputy director P Radhakrishnan, the petitioner in the case. Citing the documents produced, ASG Raju argued that the two women police constables who gave statements about ED forcing Swapna were not on duty on August 12 and 13, when the influence was allegedly exerted. The FIR was launched at a time when court proceedings in the gold smuggling case was about to begin. Swapna had given statement before a magistrate on some serious matters and crime branch has not questioned this, the court was told. Senior public prosecutor Suman Chakravarthy argued that the petition filed by an official who is not an accused in the case to quash the FIR is not maintainable.  Chakravarthy also argued that it is unnatural that statements of accused in gold smuggling case are being produced along with a petition filed by a private person. The court then asked how these documents came to be produced. ASG Raju told the court that these documents were produced before the lower court. Stating that prosecution has clear answers to the contentions of the petitioner, the senior prosecutor sought time until March 30 to respond. Prosecution has serious concern about the documents produced along with the petition, he submitted while opposing the demand for a stay. Since no official has been named an accused there is no purpose for issuing a stay, he argued. While declining to issue a stay on investigation, the court directed that no coercive action should be taken against the officials until March 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-declines-to-stay-probe-against-ed-officials/articleshow/81676207.cms||---

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, while inaugurating 18 residential and non-residential buildings of the revenue department on Wednesday, said that Varanasi and Gorakhpur will be taken up as pilots for this project. “Most complaints that are received from villages pertain to the revenue department but in several places there aren’t even district or tehsil headquarters. Previous governments made political announcements for these buildings but never acted on them. How can the government function without an office? Now, we will work on constructing joint offices for the administration and division so that a person is able to get all work done at the same place,” he said. The CM said that buildings of several tehsil, administration and division offices were extremely old and dilapidated. These would be rebuilt while offices from which residential quarters of employees were far away, would also get residential buildings. “We cannot have employees wasting their time travelling for hours to get to work so we will build residential quarters within the office premises or close by,” he said. On Wednesday, Yogi inaugurated 12 non-residential and six residential buildings of the revenue department, a project worth Rs 118 crore. These buildings are located in 13 districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-one-building-for-offices-residences-for-better-efficiency/articleshow/81677813.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Set aside rift with Mamata to stop BJP: Hemant soren in Bengal||RANCHI: Barely three days before the first phase of voting in West Bengal commences on March 27, chief minister Hemant Soren on Wednesday hit the campaign trail for the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the neighbouring state’s Purulia district. From a dais at Bandwan assembly constituency, Hemant backed Didi and said his party chose to set aside differences with her to stop BJP. “Purulia, Bankura and Midnapore are not new to us. We have been coming here for ages, standing in support with the Adivasis and contesting elections for many years. But this election is different. This is an election to save the values, culture, existence, religious harmony and the interests of the Adivasis. The ideals of JMM and TMC are somewhat similar and my party chose to set aside differences with Didi to stop BJP,” Hemant said. “After winning a few seats in the Lok Sabha election, they (BJP) think it can win the assembly election here. They had made the same mistake in Jharkhand after winning 12 of the 14 LS seats, but we ousted them and now, Didi’s TMC will do the same here,” Hemant told the gathering in Santhali. He was speaking at Sindri village football ground in Barrabazar block of Purulia district under Bandwan (ST) assembly constituency which goes to poll on March 27. Hemant, flanked by TMC leaders and its Bandwan candidate Rajiv Lochan Soren, said BJP and its ideological organisation RSS is trying to win through money and muscle power. “RSS has pushed its workers in every assembly segment of West Bengal for over six months now. They are spending money like anything. Beware of them and their agents,” he said. Before arriving at Bandwan, Hemant flew in a chopper from Ranchi to Bamni Charki Pathar village under Manbazar assembly constituency in Purulia. From Bandwan, he flew to Simlapal village under Taldangra assembly segment, which goes to vote in the second phase. “No one in West Bengal feels strongly for the development of Adivasis except Didi,” Hemant said. “The fight in West Bengal is a directly between TMC and BJP. So be alert and see that none of your votes go to waste,” he said. Attacking the BJP government in the Centre, Hemant said, “They made lakhs of migrant workers walk back to their homes during the lockdown without food, shelter and water. Many died during the journey. Now, they are bringing black laws which will force farmers to work as labourers in their own land,” he said. Hemant’s public meetings drew sizeable crowds. The audience hooted, clapped and played drums when he raised the pitch. “The meetings were hugely successful and showed that there is a strong support for JMM in these parts,” JMM’s West Bengal unit chief Bittu Murmu told TOI over phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/set-aside-rift-with-mamata-to-stop-bjp-hemant-in-bengal/articleshow/81676221.cms||---

There are 12 designated Covid hospitals in the district. In less than a week, the number of active Covid cases in the district have doubled from 78 on March 16 to 161 on Tuesday night.

From May 12 last year when the first case of coronavirus was reported in the district till March 23, East Singhbhum has witnessed 18,523 cases. While East Singhbhum, with 356 Covid casualties till Tuesday evening, remains the worst affected of all 24 districts as far as the death toll is concerned, there have been no casualties here since January 16, when the only coronavirus-related death of this calendar year was recorded.

---||Rajkot||Six youngsters lose Rs 68L in hope of getting railways job||Rajkot: Six youngsters lost Rs 68 lakh to fraudsters who lured them with the promise of a job in the India Railways. The Rajkot detection of crime branch (DCB) on Wednesday booked three persons for cheating following a complaint filed by the father of one of the victims.DCB booked Shailesh Dalsaniya, a native of Falla village of Jamnagar, who lives in Rajkot; Kalpesh Sheth, a resident of Ahmedabad and Iqbal Khatri, from Rajpipla town in Narmada district based on a complaint filed by Ghanshyam Chudasama (40), a resident of Gokul Tenament on Jamnagar road in Rajkot.Chudasama alleged that the trio who had an office in Limda Chowk in Rajkot cheated six youths, including his son Jayvirsinh with the promise of a permanent job with the Indian Railways.According to the police complaint, Chudasama had approached Dalsaniya last year for getting his son Jayvirsinh and others a government job. “Dalsaniya promised jobs in railways, but asked for money. He made the victims file application forms and also sent them for interview in New Delhi,” said a police officer. In New Delhi, the victims were given job offer letters and about two week ago, all six youths were asked to report at Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, for training, he added.However, on reaching Lucknow, Jayvirsinh was suspended from training for not paying the full amount. The Jayvirsinh got suspicious and told his father what had happened. After inquiring about Dalsaniya and others, Chidasama approached the police.Police suspect that the accused were part of a larger racket of luring job aspirants across the country. They also suspect that the training centre in Lucknow was also bogus one.“We are trying to find out how many youths from Rajkot have become a victim of this job scam and how big was it,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/six-youngsters-lose-rs-68l-in-hope-of-getting-railways-job/articleshow/81676788.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Ranchi schools may shelve physical classes, move back to online mode as cases surge||RANCHI: With a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases and the state capital accounting for the bulk of the infections, several schools here are now contemplating going back to online classes. Most of the schools had barely resumed in-person classes following a directive from the state government last month which allowed students from Class VIII onwards to attend physical classes and now they are planning to take the parents’ views before switching back to the online mode of teaching. The principal of Guru Nanak Higher Secondary School, Dr Manohar Lal, said he is planning to hold a parent-teacher meeting before Holi regarding the continuation of offline class. “It is safer to conduct online classes, even for those in the new session. Offline class will just put the students as well as the staff at risk at the moment and most of the parents feel the same way. Given the current situation, online classes should continue till summer vacation at least. Besides taking parents’ opinions, we will also take the existing government directives into account before arriving at a decision,” he added. DAV Hehal principal M K Sinha shared a similar view and said that besides speaking to the guardians before going for online classes, the school will follow whatever instructions the government issues in this regard. All Saints School has planned a similar meeting with the parents in the first week of April. “We will take a final call on which mode of teaching to go for after our meeting with the parents next month,” the school’s director, Ujala Sahay, said. She added that during a similar meeting held earlier this month, most parents were not in favour of sending their children to school. A parent named Arun Gupta said, “No matter how many times we ask them to maintain safety norms, it is not feasible to expect children to do that all the time. As responsible parents, we provide our kids with sanitizers and masks, but the risk of contracting the virus is always there.” Meanwhile, Don Bosco School here, which was planning to resume offline classes from its next session starting next week, has decided to continue with its online class till the summer vacation. “Keeping in mind the parents’ views, we have decided to continue with online teaching,” school coordinator Uma Shankar Sahu said. Meanwhile, several colleges, including Marwari College and J N College, and the B.Ed department at Ranchi Women’s College had to shut down after many of their students and employees tested positive for Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-schools-may-shelve-physical-classes-move-back-to-online-mode-as-cases-surge/articleshow/81676180.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand govt’s decision to ban religious rallies comes under BJP fire||RANCHI: A day after the district administration issued prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC in the entire city to prevent the spread of Covid-19 during the upcoming Holi and Shab-e-Baraat festivals, state BJP president Deepak Prakash on Wednesday condemned the government’s decision to ban religious processions. In a video message, Prakash said, “Chief minister Hemant Soren is hurting the religious sentiments of people by banning the religious processions of Sarhul and Ramnavami. The processions are embedded in the religious beliefs and practices of the state’s people.” He urged the government to consider allowing processions under strict monitoring by the administrative officials who can ensure that participants are wearing masks at all times and adhering to social distancing. On March 22, Hazaribag MLA Manish Jaiswal had objected to the government’s decision to ban Ramnavami gatherings. “Ramnavami is a festival of reverence in Hazaribag and banning the processions will hurt people’s sentiments,” Jaiswal had said in the assembly. While Sarhul is scheduled to be held on April 15, Ramnavami will be held on April 21. Last year, Sarhul and Ramnavami processions did not take place owing to the nationwide Covid-induced lockdown imposed. In November last year, the state government had caved in to a similar pressure mounted by BJP and reversed its order and opened Chhath ghats across Jharkhand for devotees after banning their entry initially. Responding to Prakash’s statement, JMM said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week asked all the states to remain vigilant. Your governments in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have banned Holi celebrations and processions. Prakash must refrain from resorting to cheap politics.” Meanwhile, Prakash also said that BJP expects that Hemant will adhere to social distancing in the upcoming bypoll in Madhupur seat. “We hope that the CM will hold election rallies and public meetings in Madhupur while adhering to social distancing,” he said. The Madhupur bypoll will be held on April 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-govts-decision-to-ban-religious-rallies-comes-under-bjp-fire/articleshow/81676253.cms||---
