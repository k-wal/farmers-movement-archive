Delhi is the most polluted capital city in the world. Thirty-seven of the forty most polluted cities in the world are in South Asia. These are the findings of the 2020 World Air Quality Report released by IQAir.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Here is a look at the key findings of the report.  A mere 1.6% of the cities in South Asia met the WHO PM2.5 target in 2020. Thirty-seven of the forty most polluted cities in the world in 2020 are in South Asia.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();  Nearly 13 to 22% of deaths in South Asia are linked to air pollution. Air pollution causes a loss of 7.4% of South Asia's GDP. India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh generally experience the worst air quality in this region, with 32%, 67%, and 80% of cities averaging a US AQI measurement of “Unhealthy” (> 55.5 μg/m³), respectively.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();  India showed an overall improvement in several cities, with 63% reporting direct improvements over 2019 averages. All cities whose pollution levels increased in 2020 still show an overall downward trend from 2018 and earlier. South and East Asian countries continue to be the most polluted locations. Bangladesh, China, India, and Pakistan share 49 of the 50 of the most polluted cities worldwide.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();  Air pollution contributes to nearly 7 million premature deaths annually. A staggering 600,000 of these deaths include children. Air pollution is estimated to cost the global economy upwards of $2.9 trillion per year, which is equal to 3.3% of the global GDP. The Covid-19-induced lockdown resulted in a temporary reduction in fossil-fuel consumption. This resulted in a significant decrease in air pollution. 2020 saw a remarkable 65% of global cities experience air quality improvements from 2019, while 84% of countries saw improvements overall. The report was compiled by the world's largest database of ground-based air pollution measurements, aggregating PM2.5 data published in real-time from ground-based sensors throughout 2020. The 2020 World Air Quality Report includes data for 106 countries, up from 98 countries in 2019 and 69 countries in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-third-most-polluted-country-delhi-most-polluted-capital-report/articleshow/81537532.cms||---

The rule for testing of vehicles and mandatory recall under the Central Motor Vehicle Act, notified by the transport ministry, provides for the penalty in case manufacturers or importers fail to undertake a voluntary recall. While many are critical of the low penalty level, the ministry sought to defend its action with officials arguing that currently there is no penalty. The penalty will be in addition to the cost of fixing the fault. In 2012, auto industry lobby SIAM had refrained from levying any penalty and sought a code for voluntary recall, something that was not palatable to the government, which wanted a penalty provision as a strong deterrent. The new rules will apply to vehicles that are less than seven years old with the ministry defining defects as a fault in a vehicle or component or software that poses or may pose undue risk to road safety or environment. Mandatory recall of over six lakh two-wheelers or over one-lakh four wheelers will attract the maximum penalty of Rs 1 crore. In the case of vehicles carrying over nine passengers and all heavy goods vehicles, the maximum penalty of Rs 1 crore will be imposed, if more than 50,000 vehicles are recalled on the basis of a government diktat. The government has also finalised the threshold for triggering the recall, which will be notified soon. For example, in the case of a car or SUV, if the annual sale is up to 500 units, 100 complaints (20% of the sold units) will be enough to initiate the recall process. In the case of cars and SUVs, which register annual sale is between 501 and 10,000 units, the number of complaints have to be at least 1,050 and in the case of cars sold beyond 10,000 units in a year, the number of complaints need to be at least 1,250 for initiating the mandatory recall process. Similar formula has been worked out for two-wheelers, three wheelers and quadricycles. There will be a uniform formula for other categories of vehicles including large passenger vehicles, buses and trucks. In these cases, the complaints of defects equivalent to 3% of the annual sales will trigger the government to start the process of recall. The government intends to set up a portal for vehicle owners to register and lodge their complaints. Based on complaints notices will be sent out with auto companies given 30 days to respond. Based on the responses, the designated agency probe if the vehicle is a “defective motor vehicle” before ordering a mandatory recall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/auto-cos-to-pay-max-rs-1-crore-penalty-for-mandated-recall-of-faulty-vehicles/articleshow/81538163.cms||Dipak K Dash

In its report on the labour and employment ministry’s demands for grants for 2021-22, tabled in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, the Bhartruhari Mahtab-led House panel said that it was concerned to note that numerous tea gardens faced closure during the current fiscal and even in those that remained functional, many workers were reportedly not provided with social security benefits, minimum wages, Provident Fund benefits and Gratuity benefits. “The Committee, therefore, express the need for conducting a survey with a view to obtaining authentic data on the number of tea plantations, garden workers, particularly in Assam and West Bengal. The Committee also urge upon the Ministry to undertake suitable policy initiatives/measures apart from the on-going labour reforms so as to alleviate the socio-economic conditions of the plantation workers,” the House panel report said. Pulling up the labour ministry on the issue of social security for plantation workers in West Bengal and Assam, the committee also pointed out that while the government increased projected outlay for two social security schemes in 2021-22, its expenditure on social security for this segment of tea plantation workers has been “abysmally low” in the current fiscal. “The Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme and Family Pension cum Life Insurance Scheme are under implementation for providing social security to tea plantation workers in terms of the Assam Tea Plantations Provident Fund Scheme Act, 1955. For... 2021-22, against projected outlay of Rs 40 crore, an allocation of Rs 60 crore has been made for ‘social security for plantation workers’. While allocation for…2021-22 exceeds projected requirement…in…2020-21…expenditure on ‘social security for the plantation workers’ has been abysmally low amounting to only 30% of Budget Estimate (BE) amount for the year,” the committee said. Both Assam and West Bengal are facing assembly elections next month and political parties have made a beeline to lure the sizeable garden and plantation worker community. While Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was seen plucking tea leaves alongside tea garden workers in Assam, BJP launched door-to-door campaigns to inform tea garden workers about the Rs 1,000 crore package earmarked for them in the Union budget.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/parl-panel-concerned-over-tea-plantation-workers-in-bengal-assam-being-denied-social-security-benefits/articleshow/81538708.cms||Swati Mathur
---||India||India has ability to thwart Chinese hackers or any other cyber attacks, govt tells parl panel||NEW DELHI: The government has told the parliamentary standing committee on information technology that it has the cutting edge technology, standard operating procedures and processes to tackle any cyber-attack that may come India’s way. Appearing before the Shashi Tharoor-led House panel on Tuesday, IT secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney told the committee that India has robust cyber security mechanisms in place and that it is well prepared to counter and quell any attacks. In response to questions about the Mumbai outage, which Massachusetts-based cybersecurity firm Recorded Future had in February attributed to the infiltration of Chinese state-backed hackers in at least 10 electricity assets owned by NTPC and POSCO, Sawhney is learnt to have acknowledged “a problem”, but did not divulge details referring to them as “classified information”. Sources TOI spoke to also said the official told the panel that the government had identified and neutralised the threat. Earlier, the standing committee on energy had also pulled up the Centre for “laxity” in safeguarding the cybersecurity of India’s electricity infrastructure amid ongoing efforts to integrate the national grid infrastructure with the internet. “Since the country has decided to go ahead with the smart grid and smart metering technologies in a big way, the committee is of the view that such issues could wreak havoc in the energy sector, if we are not prepared with a fool-proof plan to timely avert them,” the committee had said in its report. On Tuesday, members of the IT panel also sought to know where India had located its servers and cyber security infrastructure, and whether the government had drawn up a list of “bad hackers” whose activities it would track. Sources said the government said it did not have such a list. Ministry officials were also unable to unable to provide data of the number of cyber-attacks India has faced over the last few months. A day earlier, the IT panel had also questioned the government over the new digital media rules it notified to regulate OTT and social media platforms. Panel members also argued that government did not have the right to demand that social media platforms part with information about the “originators” of messages on demand by government or courts, saying this would interfere with the encryption offered by various platforms. Government, however, argued that technical experts it conferred with had said social media platforms could, before messages were encrypted, identify where an offensive message had originated, and that the government was empowered, under Section 69(A) of the IT Act, 2000, to demand this information. In response, the government had told the House panel that “Energy Efficiency Services Limited had investigated the (Mumbai) incident and the disconnection was being done from HES (Head End System) and it has been moved to the MDM which is better practice. It was further said that so far, it has not come to any conclusion relating to cyber security aspect or of any sabotage and EESL has been asked to take corrective actions,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-has-ability-to-thwart-chinese-hackers-or-any-other-cyber-attacks-govt-tells-parl-panel/articleshow/81538677.cms||Swati Mathur

The report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour on the Demands for Grants for 2021-22 was tabled in Lok Sabha on Tuesday. The panel said though the ministry’s expenditure for the current fiscal was bumped up on account of the newly-launched Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), the government could only spend about 52.8% of the funds till February 15. The report also said two new schemes, the PMGKY and Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY) were launched with the intention to cater to the needs of people during the pandemic and emphasised that the ministry must make “accurate budgetary estimates” before seeking supplementary allocations. “The scheme wise analysis of utilisation of funds for 2020-21 (up to February 18, 2021) revealed that the Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS) and PMGKY are the only schemes which recorded expenditure to the extent of 100% and 109.62%, respectively vis-a- vis RE whereas for most other schemes, the percentage of utilisation has been to the extent of 70-80%,” the report said. In case of the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) and Social Security Schemes for Tea Plantation Workers in Assam, utilisation recorded was as low as 24.52% and 30% respectively. The committee also pointed to the government’s failure to meet physical targets of key schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-Dhaan Yojana (PMSYM) where against a target of enrolling 2 crore new beneficiaries, only 1.18 lakh were enlisted. The National Pension Scheme for Traders, Shopkeepers and Self-Employed Persons scheme suffered similarly, with only 6,213 beneficiaries enlisted against a target of 50 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/parl-panel-raps-labour-ministry-for-non-optimal-use-of-funds/articleshow/81538720.cms||Swati Mathur

The coverage of beneficiaries aged over 60 crossed one crore in 15 days, the health ministry said. On Tuesday, over 19.11 lakh doses were given till 7pm taking the total number of jabs administered so far to 3.48 crore. While 1.5 crore health and frontline workers have received at least one dose, 61.68 lakh have also received the second dose, indicating that merely 50% of the estimated three crore health and frontline workers have been covered with the first dose so far. The increase in coverage is largely driven by people above 60 years of age, accounting for nearly 33% of the total doses given till Tuesday evening. Besides, 21.43 lakh doses have also been given to those between 45 to 60 years age with specific co-morbidities.

Experts point to an urgent need to ramp up coverage by relaxing age restrictions, targeted vaccinations in high-burden districts, increasing the intervening period between two doses to achieve maximum coverage with the available doses and allowing more vaccines to expand the kitty.

While the Hajibal house belongs to Shakir Bashir Magrey, the owner of a furniture shop near the site of attack, the Hakripora one is owned by Tariq Ahmed Shah and his daughter Insha Jan, an NIA official said. Magrey, Shah and Insha had provided shelter to the attackers, he added. According to NIA sources, during initial interrogation, Magrey revealed that on several occasions, he collected and delivered arms, ammunition, cash and explosive materials to various Jaish terrorists, including those involved in the Pulwama attack. Magrey told NIA sleuths that he was introduced to Adil in mid-2018 by a Pakistani terrorist called Mohammad Umar Farooq, after which he became a full-time overground worker of Jaish. Shah and his daughter Insha had provided shelter to the Pakistani terrorist and Adil, according to NIA.

Towards this end, a language inspection by Suniti Sharma, director of official language department, ministry of human resource development, was conducted on the NIT campus recently. During their interaction, NIT-Srinagar director Rakesh Sehgal and registrar SK Bukhari apprised Sharma of the progress in adoption of Hindi language on the campus for official transactions. Sharma also interacted with heads of departments and faculty members, including in-charge of the NIT’s Hindi Cell, to take stock of work being done for OL implementation. She was informed that the Hindi Cell was created for the implementation of Raj Basha and that Sehgal had already placed his requirement of staff for the cell before the higher education department. Sharma said the main objective of OL is to conduct all official transaction in one language (Hindi) throughout the country. As per provisions of Section 3 (3) of the Official Language Act-1963, the website of the institute should be bilingual (Hindi and English). However, signboards, stationery items, forms, notice boards, rubber stamps, etc. should be prepared in the regional language, Hindi and English. “Official letters received in Hindi would be answered in the Hindi language only,” the OL Act says. In order to train in and learn the official language, the Centre has directed NIT-Srinagar to use computer-based software LILA (Leaning Indian Languages Through Artificial Intelligence), Hindi Prabodh, Praveen, Pragya, etc. for the benefit of officers and employees nominated for working in Hindi. Sehgal said they are duty-bound to fulfil the national mandate for implementation of the official language. “It is a national mandate. NIT-Srinagar would be actively involved in the implementation of the official language and fulfil its national duty,” he said, adding that learning different languages can prove highly beneficial for both faculty and the staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/srinagar-nit-set-to-adopt-hindi-as-official-language/articleshow/81539604.cms||M Saleem Pandit

He also confirmed that he will visit India in April. Launching the UK’s Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy, which sets out the UK’s vision of its role in the world over the next decade, Johnson singled out India for a mention, describing India as “the world’s biggest democracy”. he said the purpose of his trip was to “strengthen friendship with India”. The review states that the UK will agree an Enhanced Trade Partnership with India as a stepping stone towards a comprehensive trade deal, and that it will also join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and Asean as a Dialogue Partner. “In the decade ahead, the UK will deepen our engagement in the Indo-Pacific, establishing a greater and more persistent presence than any other European country. The region is already critical to our economy and security; is a focal point for the negotiation of international laws, rules and norms; and will become more important to UK prosperity over the next decade,” the review states. “We will pursue deeper engagement in the Indo-Pacific in support of shared prosperity and regional stability, with stronger diplomatic and trading ties. This approach recognises the importance of powers in the region such as China, India and Japan.” In his speech, Johnson said, “There is no question that China will pose a great challenge for an open society such as ours. But we will also work with China where that is consistent with our values and interests, including building a stronger and positive economic relationship and in addressing climate change.” In 2021 the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, one of the two largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy, will lead a British and allied task group to the Indo-Pacific on the UK’s most ambitious global deployment for two decades, exercising with Britain’s allies and partners along the way. “The UK-India relationship is already strong, but over the next ten years we seek transformation. India — as the largest democracy in the world — is an international actor of growing importance. Our vision is for re-energised trade and investment, rooted in science and technology and supporting levelling up in the UK and India alike; enhanced defence cooperation that brings a more secure Indian Ocean Region; and UK-India leadership to tackle global challenges like climate change, clean energy and global health,” the review states. The United States will remain the UK’s most important strategic ally and Britain is deeply committed to multilateralism and strengthening global bodies, such as WHO, it states. “The significant impact of China’s military modernisation and growing international assertiveness within the Indo-Pacific region and beyond will pose an increasing risk to UK interests,” the review states. “Opportunistic states will increasingly seek strategic advantage through exploiting and undermining democratic systems and open economies.” The review also highlights threats to the international order from Russia, North Korea and Iran, as well as from Big Tech, and points out that disinformation is being used against countries by non-state actors who are sometimes used as proxies by states. But Britain would act as a force for good in the Indo-Pacific region, promoting open societies, a strong rule of law, media freedoms and the respect for human rights, it states. “Global Britain is not a reflection of old obligations, still less a vainglorious gesture, but a necessity for the safety and prosperity of the British people in the decades ahead,” Johnson said. “We must show that liberal democracy and free markets remain the best model for the social and economic advancement of humankind. China’s increasing power and international assertiveness is likely to be the most significant geopolitical factor of the 2020s,” the review said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/boris-johnson-launches-foreign-policy-review-with-indo-pacific-tilt-confirms-visit-to-india-in-april/articleshow/81539750.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The United States will remain the UK’s most important strategic ally and Britain is deeply committed to multilateralism and strengthening global bodies, such as WHO, it states. “The significant impact of China’s military modernisation and growing international assertiveness within the Indo-Pacific region and beyond will pose an increasing risk to UK interests,” the review states. “Opportunistic states will increasingly seek strategic advantage through exploiting and undermining democratic systems and open economies.” The review also highlights threats to the international order from Russia, North Korea and Iran, as well as from Big Tech, and points out that disinformation is being used against countries by non-state actors who are sometimes used as proxies by states. But Britain would act as a force for good in the Indo-Pacific region, promoting open societies, a strong rule of law, media freedoms and the respect for human rights, it states. “Global Britain is not a reflection of old obligations, still less a vainglorious gesture, but a necessity for the safety and prosperity of the British people in the decades ahead,” Johnson said. “We must show that liberal democracy and free markets remain the best model for the social and economic advancement of humankind. China’s increasing power and international assertiveness is likely to be the most significant geopolitical factor of the 2020s,” the review said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/boris-johnson-launches-foreign-policy-review-with-indo-pacific-tilt-confirms-visit-to-india-in-april/articleshow/81539686.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||World||France says it has entered third Covid-19 wave; new cases highest since November||PARIS: French Prime Minister Jean Castex told Parliament on Tuesday that France had entered a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, as the seven-day average of new cases rose above 25,000 for the first time since Nov. 20. French health authorities reported 29,975 new cases on Tuesday, a 4.5% jump versus last Tuesday's total and the sharpest week-on-week rise in a month and a half. France is grappling with a steady rise of new cases, leading to a heavy strain on the country's hospital system, which prominent health experts say can be spared only by a new lockdown. Like other EU countries, France has lagged far behind the United States or Britain in vaccinating its population. President Emmanuel Macron is still hoping a vaccination drive can stave off the effects of a new pandemic wave triggered by more contagious variants, and thus prevent France from resorting to a third national lockdown. But suspension of the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, announced on Monday over safety concerns, could jeopardise the government's strategy. The health ministry said there were 4,239 patients in intensive care units for Covid-19, up by 20 over 24 hours and setting a nearly four-month high. The total number of people hospitalized for the disease was up by 23, at 25,492, a high since Feb 24. The number of people who have died went up by 408, at 91,170, the world's seventh-highest death toll. The seven-day moving average of deaths is 267. With 4.11 million people infected since the start of the outbreak, France has the sixth-highest case count in the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/france-says-it-has-entered-third-covid-19-wave-new-cases-highest-since-november/articleshow/81540486.cms||---

Pantnagar police have begun a probe and are yet to make arrests. The 42-year-old series-maker is based out of Kandivli (W). In early March, an acquaintance informed him that a starlet was keen to be cast in a series. He called her for an audition on March 6. The 24-year-old aspiring model told him she was ready to do bold roles. They had a conversation, following which they got intimate. Later, the model’s boyfriend called up the series-maker, accused him of exploiting her and threatened to file rape charges. The series-maker tried to explain that she had consented to having relations with him but her boyfriend was not convinced. The series-maker kept getting calls from the model’s boyfriend and he was summoned to Ghatkopar on March 10. At Arunkumar Vaidya Garden in Ghatkopar (E), the model and her three male associates intercepted the series-maker’s car and got in. The series-maker later told police that he overheard names of two who got in his car: Vishnu and Kushal. The group roughed him up and hurled expletives at him. At knifepoint, the men got him to drive his vehicle to Wadala and then to Sion. “Two of the men demanded Rs 4 lakh from him. They snatched his phone to transfer the money from his UPI-based payment application,” said a police officer. But the accused were not well-versed with using the app and ended up keying in wrong OTPs repeatedly. They could transfer Rs 1.4 lakh eventually. They then got him to halt the vehicle at an ATM in Sion and forced him to withdraw Rs20,000. After taking his money, they got out of the car, threatening him. The shaken-up series-maker summoned courage to approach Kandivli police only on March 13. An FIR was registered and the case was transferred to Pantnagar police station on Monday. “The series-maker was honey-trapped. We are probing the possibility of the group similarly duping others. We are checking call data records and will make arrests soon,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/web-series-maker-abducted-sees-drama-in-real-life/articleshow/81540526.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||India||Congress may appoint sulking Navjot Singh Sidhu Punjab deputy chief minister||NEW DELHI: Congress is mulling appointing the sulking Navjot Singh Sidhu as deputy chief minister in Punjab, an option that the party thinks can placate the volatile leader and settle things in the state unit ahead of assembly elections. It is learnt that Sidhu as deputy CM to chief minister Amarinder Singh is a combination the party leadership is actively considering as it considers options in Punjab. That Amarinder Singh would be the automatic CM face besides being actively projected as one may ensure that the veteran does not mind the solution offered by the peace brokers. Ever since Sidhu went out of the Amarinder Singh government, Congress has been trying to broker a compromise. The cricketer-turned-politician has a good relationship with the Gandhi siblings, Rahul and Priyanka, and this is a factor in his favour besides the fact that he is seen as an effective campaigner who can help the party at the hustings. What seems to weigh on the mind of the Congress brass is that Sidhu, if he joins a rival, has the firepower to hurt the party even if it does not help him much personally. While he cannot join Akali Dal, Aam Aadmi Party is surely an option for him and the CM would be wary of that — evident from the fact that he has hired pollster Prashant Kishor for the election campaign well in advance by making him an advisor in the state government. Kishor was an advisor for the previous poll as well. “Sidhu is important enough to be given something that will placate him while not upsetting the state leadership,” a source said. Lately, Sidhu has criticised the state of Punjab finances and also slammed the state government for not crafting alternative bills to neutralise the central farm laws — statements that have widely been seen as the dissident’s message to the party that he was still unhappy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-may-appoint-sulking-navjot-singh-sidhu-punjab-deputy-chief-minister/articleshow/81540703.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Goswami’s counsel Mundergi also drew attention of the high court bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale to the fact that the now suspended API Sachin Waze was in-charge of the probe. He alleged the first informant, Hansa Research group, was aware of the rigging since June 2020 and had been given the information by Waze and another officer. But an FIR was registered on October 6, 2020 by Kandivli police station claiming police had received secret information from an employee of Hansa Research group. Mundergi also said just two days after the FIR was lodged, the Mumbai police commissioner held a press conference claiming the involvement of Republic TV based allegedly on a report by Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC). The counsel said BARC had later clarified in writing that no such inquiry was on against Republic TV. Referring to Waze, Mundergi said, “The officer is also very controversial. The officer is in the news and close to the party in power.” Goswami and ARG Outlier, which owns Republic TV, had last year petitioned the HC to quash the FIR registered by Kandivli police in the TRP case. Neither are named in the FIR and, hence, their quashing petition is not maintainable is the state’s stand. But Mundergi argued that not naming him was also meant to defeat his rights. His plea is maintainable as the chargesheet has referred to the company as the “chalak-malak” (operator and owner), said the counsel, adding not naming Goswami is aimed at keeping investigation open-ended and to ensure that people connected with the channel can be harassed. The HC is hearing the plea and Goswami’s counsel will continue his submissions on Wednesday. Goswami has also sought transfer of the TRP case probe to the CBI or any other independent agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chargesheet-in-trp-case-attempt-to-target-arnab/articleshow/81540702.cms||---
---||Mumbai||NIA: Sachin Waze escorted SUV with explosives in his govt vehicle||MUMBAI: In a plea seeking suspended police officer Sachin Waze’s custody, the NIA alleged that he had used his own government vehicle to escort the explosives-laden Scorpio and himself drove the police vehicle to the ‘scene of crime’ on February 25. NIA sources said it was Waze who was at the wheel of the Innova which tailed the Scorpio to a spot near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, where it was parked. A policeman who was the official driver of the Innova told NIA that after his duty was over on February 24, he parked it inside the police headquarters and went home. It is still not clear who drove the car from there to Thane, where Waze resides. Officials said the NIA suspects the Scorpio was driven by a constable. Meanwhile, on Tuesday night, NIA seized a Mercedes car being used by Waze and seized cash worth Rs 5 lakh, a note-counting machine, documents and beer bottles from it. The car had a fake number plate, as was the case with the Scorpio and Innova. The Mercedes is registered in the name of one Manisha Bhavsar. Waze used it to commute to the police commissioner’s office, where he was posted. NIA officials on Monday night carried out a search of the Crime Intelligence Unit in the police headquarters and seized a CPU, Waze’s i-pad and some documents. Sources said there are no records of the seizure of the digital video recorder taken out of Waze’s housing society on February 27 by API Riyazuddin Kazi. The recorder contained images of the Scorpio being parked there. NIA officials suspect the image of a man in a PPE kit getting down from the Innova and walking towards the explosives-laden vehicle is of Waze. Sources said Waze has not admitted to his role in Hiran’s murder and more people are likely to be involved. “Specific inputs gathered by NIA had revealed the involvement of accused Sachin Waze, working as an assistant police inspector, crime branch, in the conspiracy leading to placing the explosives-laden SUV on Carmichael Road on February 25,” the NIA’s remand plea said. The investigating agency said it had seized the vehicle on Sunday. Earlier this week, Waze was remanded in NIA custody till March 25 in connection with the probe into recovery of explosives from the SUV found parked outside Antilia on February 25. The remand plea said that after Waze was questioned on Saturday, his “direct involvement in planting of the explosives-laden SUV… on the intervening night of February 24 and 25 had emerged”. “There is sufficient prima facie evidence to show the involvement of the accused in the conspiracy of a commission of the crime,” the remand plea said.

The NIA also said a threat letter was posted on Telegram by terror outfit Jaish-ul-Hind and a ransom demand was made claiming responsibility for the incident. It said the person lodged in Tihar jail who allegedly sent the message was taken into custody by the Delhi special cell along with the mobile instrument used. The NIA said Waze’s custody was required to check the evidence. It also said Waze’s criminal antecedents need to be brought on record to bring clarity regarding the current conspiracy and the probable links, if any. The NIA alleged the cases were being handled by four investigating officers till now, and Waze was the second. “There are discrepancies in handing over taking memos, which need to be clarified from the accused,” the NIA said. Read AlsoAmbani security scare: Sachin Waze says arrest illegal; files habeas corpus plea before Bombay HC​​​He alleged that Waze was “made a scapegoat by certain political powers’’ by using Vimla Hiren, widow of Mansukh Hiren whose whose body was found is Kalwa creek days after his Scorpio was found parked suspiciously late night outside Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month.Calling the offences grave, the NIA said the conspiracy angle needs to be thoroughly investigated and the identity of co-conspirators needs to be established by way of sustained enquiries with Waze. “Being a police officer with large amounts of wherewithal and influence at his disposition, the agency needs time to connect the missing links,” the remand plea said. The NIA said there are “reasonable and justifiable grounds” for Waze’s police custody and for confronting him with his associates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nia-sachin-waze-escorted-suv-with-explosives-in-his-govt-vehicle/articleshow/81540763.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The data on exports of 583.85 lakh doses — furnished by junior health and family minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday — assumes significance as the goal of vaccinating millions of Indians could fall behind given the existing rate of vaccination, experts told TOI. The highest number of vaccinations in a single day — over three million shots — was recorded on March 15.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Besides, the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in some states, including Maharashtra — raising fears that they could already be in the grip of a second wave — has led to a demand for expediting vaccinations across the country by covering those outside the priority population. Read AlsoNo shortage of Covid vaccine doses in any state in India, clarifies health ministryThe Union Health Ministry on Thursday clarified that there is no shortage of Covid-19 vaccine doses in any state in the country so far. Responding to a question on the Rajasthan government's claim that there is a shortage in Covid-19 vaccine stock, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said theSeveral health experts and doctors as well as CEOs, including Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra and Biocon executive chairperson Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, have urged the Centre to speed up vaccinations of the general population to counter the surges. “Vaccinations need to be increased rapidly. A scale of four or five of what we are doing today should be the minimum goal. The government should consider much greater private sector involvement and outreach vaccinations to get vaccines to the vulnerable. No doses should be wasted. So, while we continue to vaccinate the priority population, all excess vaccines should be utilised on non-priority populations. Where cases are increasing or are predicted to increase, we should consider all-age vaccination in defined high-risk areas,” recommended Gagandeep Kang, a professor at Christian Medical College, Vellore. Health economist Rijo M John felt that vaccinations need to be ramped up to at least 3.8 million doses a day to reach the target of 600 million doses by August. “If the supply of doses is comfortable in certain states and the vulnerable population has been given the jab, then it can be opened up for other age groups.” At present, vaccinations at government facilities in most states are available only four days a week. The government kicked off its vaccine diplomacy programme in January, days after launching the countrywide immunisation drive. It said it had received multiple requests for Indian-manufactured Covid-19 vaccines from many countries. “Keeping in view the domestic requirements of the phased rollout, India will continue to supply Covid-19 vaccines to partner countries over the coming weeks and months in a phased manner,” it had said then, adding that it will ensure that manufacturers will have adequate stocks to meet domestic needs. On Tuesday, Choubey reiterated this assurance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-exports-over-twice-the-number-of-doses-used-at-home/articleshow/81540812.cms||Rupali Mukherjee
---||Delhi||Delhi: Two inmates arrested for Tihar mercury poison plot||NEW DELHI: Two Islamic State operatives have been remanded in four days’ police custody after they were arrested by the Special Cell in connection with an alleged conspiracy to eliminate two Delhi riots accused inside Tihar Jail through mercury poisoning. Intelligence agencies are now learnt to be in discussions with the Tihar administration and Delhi Police to chalk out a plan to secure inmates in sensitive cases. As per the remand paper, the two operatives have been identified as Abdullah Basith (27) alias Khattab Bhai Khurasani and Azeemushan. Basith, an engineering dropout, is known to be a hardcore influencer of the IS ideology. He was earlier under the scanner for his alleged role in fomenting trouble in the backdrop of protests against Citizenship Amendment Act. This came to light after the arrests of a Kashmiri couple for allegedly making use of the protests to instigate Muslims to indulge in arson and riots. Basith was arrested by National Investigation Agency (NIA) in August 2018 in connection with the 2016 Abu Dhabi IS module. Azeemushan has also been arrested and charged by NIA in a terror case. In January, Delhi Police’s Special Cell arrested a Tihar inmate, Mohammed Shahid, and his associate, Aslam, in the alleged poisoning case. Shahid is serving a life sentence after being convicted of gang-raping a woman and killing her and her two children in west Delhi in 2015. The arrests reportedly helped the cell foil a plan hatched by a convict in Tihar to eliminate two Delhi riots accused in the jail. TOI had earlier reported that two Islamic State operatives lodged in Tihar had been questioned and were being probed as the brains behind the alleged plot. Their targets were two accused arrested for alleged murders and vandalisation of a mosque in northeast Delhi last year. The plan was allegedly to stage a brawl in their ward and administer mercury to them in the melee. Shahid had called up Aslam from Tihar and asked him to smuggle in mercury in thermometers. The Special Cell intercepted this call and nabbed Aslam with the substance. He led the cops to Shahid who gave information about Azeemushan, an operative of IS’ Roorkee module. They had met in jail number 3 and allegedly made the planning. Despite several attempts, senior Special Cell officials were unavailable for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-inmates-arrested-for-tihar-mercury-poison-plot/articleshow/81538594.cms||Raj Shekhar

Cleanliness and hygiene will be maintained and the canteens would be inspected by the DM, civil surgeon and other senior officials at regular intervals. To launch the programme, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed between the Bihar Rural Livelihoods Promotion Society and the State Health Society on February 21. Patna DM Dr Chandrasekhar Singh on Tuesday said the four facilities involved in the programme starting mid-April are the sub-divisional hospitals of Patna city, Danapur, Barh and Masaurhi. As per the MOU, 'Didi Ki Rasoi' would cost Rs 150 per day per patient. Instructions have been issued to the hospitals to arrange the basic requirements for the Jeevika canteens, Singh said. "The programme aimed at supporting the rural enterprise run by community initiative for improved service delivery in government hospitals while generating an economic return to entrepreneurs," the DM said. Didi Ki Rasoi canteen has been functioning in the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in Patna. On March 13, the DM visited the RBI canteen and spoke to bank officials and Jeevika workers. He also tasted the meal to be assured of the quality. This new canteen may begin at hospitals in Barh and Masaurhi from the first week where necessary arrangements have already been made, those at Danapur and City are likely to come up by April 15, the DM added. The deputy superintendent of the 50-bed Masaurhi hospital, Dr Sanjeeta Rani, said the Jeevika Didis will be provided with an apron, mask, headwear and gloves to work in the canteen space. As most beds remain occupied by patients from neighbouring villages, the quality meals provided would prove to be of much help to patients and their attendants, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/didi-ki-rasoi-to-come-up-in-four-patna-hospitals-soon/articleshow/81536940.cms||---

From March 17-31, the curfew has been prolonged by two hours and will now be effective from 10 pm to 6 am. The decision struck a discordant note with restaurant owners and traders who cried foul saying that it will impact their businesses adversely. Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA) – Gujarat, said, “The restaurant industry has been bearing the brunt of the government’s curfew decision from the start. When the industry had started showing revival signs, the extension of night curfew timings will again affect the revenues.” The state on Tuesday recorded 954 new cases of Covid-19 taking the total number to 2.8 lakh. Two deaths, both in Ahmedabad, were also reported. Surat reported 263 cases while Ahmedabad recorded 241. Many Covid-19 cases were reported from educational institutions. On Tuesday, of the total 263 cases reported in Surat, 39 Covid-19 cases were reported from schools and colleges. In Vadodara, 10 teachers and one student are currently undergoing treatment for Covid-19 after their samples for coronavirus tested positive. In all, 25 teachers have tested positive ever since the schools reopened. In the wake of rising numbers, Surat Municipal Corporation slapped a slew of curbs including closing down of all public gardens and taking off as many as 300 public transport buses off the city roads. The Sarthana Nature Park and Zoo too was ordered shut for public till further orders. The SMC also mandated weekly testing of people associated with textile and diamond industries. “Daily checking with a pulse oximeter (to measure oxygen saturation level) will also be mandatory,” stated the SMC release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/night-curfew-now-from-10pm-in-4-major-guj-cities-till-march-31/articleshow/81541682.cms||---

---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Mayoral race heats up with women, backward class aspirants in fray||AMARAVATI: The selection of candidates for mayor posts in corporations has become a tricky issue for the YSRC with chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy firm on giving a fair share to women and backward classes. The chief minister has asked the party observers and key ministers to ready the lists keeping in mind various social equations. Although the legislators had thought the list for mayor and deputy mayor candidates would be finalised by Tuesday, it is getting delayed due to prolonged discussions between the senior leaders. Party general secretaries, observers to different districts and in-charge ministers were besieged by aspirants and legislators with their own set of proposals on Tuesday. Sources said that senior leaders are trying to convince strong contenders for the top post in civic bodies as the party is looking for more women and BC candidates. Sources said it is possible that some strong candidates, even from the backward classes community, might lose the opportunity due to the chief minister’s resolve to accord top priority to women candidates in big cities. The State Election Commission (SEC) has issued notification for the conduct of the elections for the mayor, deputy mayor in corporations and chairperson and vice-chairperson posts in municipalities on March 18. According to sources, the chief minister has approved the names of B Y Ramaiah for Kurnool, Suresh Babu for Kadapa, Dr Sirisha for Tirupati and G Sujatha for Ongole mayor posts. Both B Y Ramaiah (BC) and Suresh Babu (BC) have been with the party since its inception and work as party district unit presidents. Ramaiah had even lost an opportunity to contest MP election. The decision about mayor candidates for Tirupati and Ongole corporations were taken much before the polls. Local legislators Karunakar Reddy and Balineni Srinivasa Reddy faced the elections by declaring mayor candidates with the CM’s permission. With both seats allotted to the women quota, the party is now scouting for at least another three places to appoint women as mayors. Sources said the post of Vijayawada mayor is likely to go to a BC woman aspirant. Although the party floor leader in the previous council Bandi Punyaseela was a strong contender, the equation has gone against her as the CM is keen on a BC woman for the post while Punayseela belongs to an upper caste community. Sources said that district in-charge minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy is still backing Punyaseela for the top post provided that women get fair representation in other cities. Sources said the party is also considering Rayana Bhagyalakshmi’s name for the top post as she belongs to the BC community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/mayoral-race-heats-up-with-women-bc-aspirants-in-fray/articleshow/81536374.cms||Samdani MN

With Rema in the fray as UDF-backed candidate, the constituency is set to witness an intense political fight which will once against bring to the fore the murder of rebel CPM leader TP Chandrasekharan as a key campaign issue. Though Rema had contested as independent in Vadakara in 2016, she came third despite managing to secure over 20,000 votes. But this time she has the support of UDF which was the runner-up in 2016 election and this is expected to help her mount a formidable electoral challenge against LDF. The seat was won by CK Nanu of JD(S) by around 9000 votes. Though RMP had initially favoured fielding party state secretary N Venu as Rema was reluctant to contest again, Congress and IUML exerted pressure on the party to field her as a common candidate. With UDF insisting on Monday that their support for RMP hinges on her candidature, RMP leadership met again on Tuesday and decided to field Rema. “During the past five years, CPM used its power tried to protect the murderers of TP Chandrasekharan and scuttle the case. So our fight in Vadakara is to oust the murderers from Kerala politics,” Venu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/udf-to-support-rema-in-vadakara/articleshow/81538581.cms||---

In the wake of state-wide spike in cases, chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan has instructed all district collectors to crack down on public functions, if conducted by not adhering to Covid-19 precautions. District collector K Rajamani said, “The daily Covid-19 count has increased to 800 from less than 400 in the state. The district too has recorded 81 cases today (Tuesday), compared to 44 to 45 cases a day till March. People need to understand the seriousness of following Covid-19 protocols. We need to curb the spread.” As part of enforcing the standard operating procedures, he said people not wearing masks at public places, election meetings and campaigns, and functions like weddings, would be fined. “This is to ensure that no one is stepping outside without a mask. Unless the public cooperate by following hand washing and sanitizing, and face mask rules, it will be difficult to control the increasing numbers,” the collector said. Health officers said small family clusters were a major contributor to the single-day spike in cases. Three family clusters with four cases each were seen on the day too. “We can only advise people with symptoms to isolate themselves within their houses and get tested. People have to realise their responsibilities. Almost all family clusters have a history of travel or attending a public function recently,” the collector said. Since hospitals are also a source for infection, they have been instructed to sanitise and disinfect surfaces and floors often, as they did during August-September last year, when the caseload was at its peak. The city corporation has collected a fine of Rs 63,800 from 319 people for not wearing face masks and Rs 6,700 from shops for their failure to ensure that customers were following the Covid norms. The violations were mostly reported from the east zone, followed by the north and west zones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/at-81-dist-sees-2nd-highest-single-day-spike-this-year/articleshow/81538582.cms||---

The EC will issue notification on March 23 and hold the election on April 17. The counting of votes would be held on May 2, along with some other constituencies across the state. Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency fell vacant following the death of sitting MP Balli Durga Prasada Rao of YSRC on September 16, 2020 due to Covid-19. Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency is reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC) and covers Tirupati, Srikalahasti and Satyavedu (SC) assembly constituencies of Chittoor district and Sarvepalli, Venkatagiri, Guduru (SC) and Sullurupet (SC) constituencies of Nellore district Meanwhile, the BJP, which had aligned with Jana Sena, has decided to contest the by-election and is likely to field retired IAS officer Dasari Srinivasulu. The BJP, which had won the Telangana’s Dubbaka assembly seat in a recent by-election, now wants to make its presence felt in Andhra Pradesh. The TDP had named former Union minister Panabaka Lakshmi as the party’s candidate in November 2020. However, with indications that Lakshmi not keen on contesting, the party has to announce the candidature once again. The YSRC had named noted physiotherapist Dr Gurumurthy as its candidate. Chief minister and YSRC chief Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy had cleared the candidature of Dr Gurumurthy after giving a promise to do justice to the late MP Balli Durgaprasada Rao’s family. Accordingly, Durga Prasada Rao’s son Kalyana Chakravarthy was recently sent to the legislative council. As the schedule was released in Delhi by the Election Commission, AP’s minister for panchayat raj and rural development Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy, declared the candidature of Dr Gurumurthy from the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tirupati-ls-bypoll-to-be-held-on-april-17/articleshow/81536716.cms||Gopi Dara

For every notch of rating downgrade thereafter, the coupon would be increased by 0.50% per notch.

The retail sector, along with several others, was crippled when India went in for a complete lockdown last March to arrest the spread of the pandemic. While other sectors have since recovered, retail had continued to lag. The quantum of de-growth in retail sales has reduced as most segments have started to show significant improvement. A survey by the Retailers Association of India (RAI) indicates sales in February 2021 were at -7% of last year’s sales on a year-on-year (YoY) comparison. RAI’s CEO Kumar Rajagopalan said, “We hope that the uncertainty regarding the rising cases of Covid in a few states will not cast its shadow on the growth momentum with the rollout of the vaccine. Restrictions or not, it has now become imperative for every retailer to adopt ‘phygital’ in various ways — be it social media, messaging platforms, or digital shopping in addition to their normal channels — to align themselves with the changing consumer mindsets of the Next Normal.” Consumer durables grew 15% YoY, while QSRs grew 18% in February. Categories like footwear, beauty, wellness & personal care, sports goods and food & grocery are showing a steady recovery, the survey said. Recovery across regions is showing steady improvement with eastern India indicating growth of 2% in the month of February. Southern & northern India have recovered better with sales nearing pre-Covid levels at -6% and -9% respectively YoY, while progress in the western region was slower at -16%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/retail-at-93-of-pre-covid-level-in-february-finds-survey/articleshow/81537855.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli
---||Patna||Stop playing vulgar songs in buses, autos: Transport dept||PATNA: The state transport department has asked district transport officers, motor vehicle inspectors and other officials concerned to cancel the permit of commercial vehicles, including autorickshaws, found playing raunchy songs and videos. Transport commissioner Seema Tripathi said the department had taken a decision in July 2018 to issue permits to public vehicles only on the condition that vulgar songs would not be played. “The order is still in force. The officials should ensure its strict implementation. They have also been asked to impose fine on vehicle drivers if they are found guilty of playing vulgar songs,” Tripathi said. State transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the department has received several complaints about playing of vulgar songs in public vehicles. “Such nuisances increase during Holi. Hence, the officials concerned have been asked to take action against the erring drivers of public transport vehicles,” Agarwal added. People, especially women, have hailed the initiative of transport department. “It becomes very embarrassing when such songs are played in autorickshaws. The lyrics of the songs contain vulgar words,” said Shikha, who was seen getting off an autorickshaw at Hartali Mor on Monday. “Loud songs which the drivers play in autorickshaws also harm our ears. The vulgar content of songs embarrass us,” said Neha, student of a city college. Ranjit Kumar of Patna Zila Auto Chalak Sangh said the autorickshaw drivers should abide by the order. “However, they should be allowed to play radio while driving,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/stop-playing-vulgar-songs-in-buses-autos-transport-dept/articleshow/81536399.cms||---
---||Patna||Tejashwi breaks free from shadow of Lalu, leads oppn charge in House||PATNA: Thirty-one-year-old Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, the younger son of former CM Lalu Prasad, is in new avatar as the youngest leader of opposition in the state legislative assembly. He has been able to create a buzz in political circles in his new role. He has emerged as a strong leader of opposition this time compared to his previous tenure as opposition leader as well as deputy CM. Tejashwi is leaving no opportunity to attack the ruling NDA in the House. As a result, noisy scenes in the House have become a routine affair. Though the ruling alliance has described him as a ‘twitter babua’ for being more active on social media, the Grand Alliance led by RJD sees him as one of formidable future leaders of Bihar. “He has become more mature in presenting the facts in the House. Undoubtedly, experience matters. Moreover, his confidence level is also high following RJD’s good performance in the assembly polls,” RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari said. The RJD had bagged 75 seats in the 243-member Bihar assembly in the 2020 assembly polls to become the single-largest party. “He missed the chair of the chief minister by a whisker. The more ruling NDA tries to corner Tejashwi on frivolous grounds, the more he will emerge as a strong leader of opposition. Challenges in political life have made him stronger,” senior RJD leader Chitranjan Gagan said. JD(U) MLC Neeraj Kumar, however, said, “Tejashwi is more active on social media platforms. People don’t take him seriously as his statement lacks evidence. Same is the case in the House. He is a leader by accident.” To buttress his point, Neeraj added, “Whenever a crisis happens in the state, he remains absent. Is it the job of the leader of opposition? Moreover, see the people around him. His behaviour shows his feudal mindset. He is not serious about his commitments.” Tejashwi's first brush with electoral politics happened in 2015 when he was made candidate from Raghopur in Vaishali district, the traditional seat of Lalu and Rabri, when JD(U) contested the assembly election with RJD-led Grand Alliance. Until 2015, his political activities had remained confined to accompanying his mother Rabri Devi in election rallies. After the 2015 elections, Tejashwi was sworn in as deputy CM and given key portfolios like road construction and building. As deputy CM, Tejashwi’s 18-month tenure was largely associated with Lalu Prasad virtually ruling all his departments by proxy. Officials close to Lalu were made advisers in Tejashwi’s departments. Tejashwi is now holding the reins of RJD in the absence of his father, who is serving sentence in fodder scam cases. “You say Tejashwi is in a new avatar. Only time will say whether it is a permanent feature or just a flash in the pan,” BJP leader Ravindra Kumar Singh, a BJP leader, said. There have been occasions when Tejashwi became more personal in his attacks on political rivals. Revenue and land reforms minister and BJP MLA from Aurai Ram Surat Kumar is a case in point. Tejashwi even raised questions about the minister’s ‘khandan (ancestors)’. Harkhu Jha, a senior Congress leader was more apt in describe Tejashwi’s role as leader of opposition in the assembly. “Tejashwi’s future is bright, but his struggles still continue,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-breaks-free-from-shadow-of-lalu-leads-oppn-charge-in-house/articleshow/81537076.cms||Ramashankar

Jha was shot dead in front of his wife, Jayanti Jha, and minor son in Mithilanchal Colony under the Beur police station area in Patna on September 12, 2016. The court of ADJ-IX Kumar Gunjan had pronounced Ranjeet Kumar alias Bittu, Ranjan Kumar, Bhola Kumar, Ajay Kumar alias Ajay Rai and Bhavya Prakash alias King and Vicky Kumar guilty on March 4. Except Ranjeet and Ajay, the rest were on bail. The murder was fallout of a financial dispute and business rivalry with Ranjeet. At least 13 bullet holes were found in Jha’s body. Jayanti and her son were hiding behind a car hardly 10 feet away when 15 people surrounded Ramchandra and fired more than 24 rounds. Jayanti had lodged an FIR and identified 10 of the 15 shooters. The court also asked Patna SSP to ensure security to Jha’s wife and her three minor children. Jayanti had kept fighting the legal battle to ensure that all those involved in murder are punished. Additional public prosecutor Braj Kishore Prasad said Ramchandra had taken Rs 5 lakh loan from Ranjeet and started a wholesale marble business in Beur which flourished. “After being provoked by associates, Ranjeet deliberately created a financial dispute with Ramchandra and took over his shop,” he said. The APP said Ramchandra started a new marble shop near his old shop which was captured by Ranjeet. “The new shop flourished too. His old shop run by Ranjeet flopped due to gathering of anti-social elements,” Prasad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/six-get-ri-for-life-in-trader-murder-case/articleshow/81537152.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Now when the officials are not even taking the chief minister seriously, what to talk about the poor cabinet ministers or anyone else in the government,” Akhilesh said. Akhilesh said now leaders of the ruling BJP are claiming that tehsil offices and police stations have turned into dens of corruption and that the chief minister’s zero-tolerance policy claims have been reduced to mere slogans. “Even more shocking is the fact that despite the growing resentment among the BJP cadres over the pathetic state of affairs prevailing in the state, the senior leaders seem unwilling to make any amends,” he said. He said the Uttar Pradesh government is indulging in false publicity. This was in apparent reference to a video that was recently shared by the state government in which a youth was shown thanking the CM for the job he got. The social media post was deleted after it was revealed that the individual had got the job during the Samajwadi Party regime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/officials-not-taking-cm-govt-seriously-claims-akhilesh/articleshow/81539816.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Bijendra was giving the government’s reply to the House debate on the combined Rs 13,973-crore budgetary demand of the home department for which the cut motion had been moved by senior Congress member Vijay Shankar Dubey. Leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav presented the opposition’s point of view on the prevailing situation on the crime front. Tejashwi also spoke on the general administration department (GAD). Nitish, who is also the home and general administration department minister, was present in the House, and the opposition did not walk out of the House, which passed the budget by voice vote. Presenting the 2019 data, Bijendra said Bihar stood at 10th position with respect to the incidents of murder, 12th in loot cases, 13th in kidnapping for ransom cases, 28th in crimes against women and at 31st in rape cases in the country. “Since the Nitish government came to power in 2005, it took several steps to improve policing machinery and control crime,” Bijendra said, adding in a bid to strengthen the investigation wing, dog squads were formed in all the districts. Bijendra referred to various steps that the government has taken to control crime. It included increasing the number of the police force, provision of increased number of vehicles and other resources for the police, improved training for the officials and police personnel, creation of separate investigation wing, early hearing in the courts and seedy trial of those arrested in rape cases. Earlier, Tejashwi had made frontal attack on the government on issues related to crime control, noting that there was “no governance in the state”. As to the general administration department, Tejashwi said the concept of hierarchy and seniority had been given a good bye, while the retired senior officials are being given new assignments. “There should be two-year cooling off period before such appointments are made,” he said. Tejashwi said in 2005, there were only 3,000 liquor shops in the state, including 500 in rural areas. However, the number of liquor shops had increased to 6,000 in 2015 before enforcement of total prohibition in the state, he added. Further, the number of liquor shops increased by 51 each year from 1947, but in 10 years of Nitish’s rule, their number increased by 300 shops per year, he also said, adding that since the enforcement of prohibition (2016), the couriers of banned liquor in the dry state were being put in jail, but no action has been taken against the suppliers of liquor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minister-crime-rate-in-bihar-low-compared-to-national-average/articleshow/81536995.cms||Abhay Singh

The number of such centres in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits would be increased to 100 from 86 and 50 from 26, respectively, in the current week, a senior health official said on Tuesday. Similarly, 30 new vaccination centres would come up in the rural belt. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical) of Pune circle, told TOI, “We are increasing the centres to meet the vaccination requirements of our target groups. Our target is to vaccinate almost 13% of the population in Pune district, 10% of whom includes citizens in the age group of 60 years and above. Another 3% are those aged 45 years and above and with comorbidities." Pune circle compries Pune, Solapur and Satara districts. Dr Deshmukh said Pune district currently had 2.25 lakh vaccine doses, including Covishield and Covaxin. “Before the arrival of the fresh stock, Pune had a balance of 75,000 doses. We received 50,000 doses of Covaxin on Sunday, adding up to 1.25 lakh total doses. On Monday, we received another lot of 1 lakh doses — 50,000 Covishield and 50,000 Covaxin. This added up to the total of 2.25 lakh doses in Pune district till Tuesday morning. All doses have reached the respective municipal bodies, as the latest policy mandates that no doses would be kept in the regional vaccine store. Upon arrival, all doses have to be directly sent to the municipal corporations,” Dr Deshmukh said. Pune zilla parishad chief executive officer Ayush Prasad told TOI that more private vaccination centres in the rural areas were being roped in, as the capacity of the primary health centres has been saturated. “Data entry is being done at the gam panchayat level during registration of the beneficiaries for the second phase of the drive. With the number of vaccination centres set to increase in the district, we plan to inoculate an entire village per day or session instead of ensuring jabs for some individuals from every village on each day.” Prasad added that the current average number of beneficiaries vaccinated in Pune rural was about 8,000 per day and expected to go up to 12,000-15,000 per day once the new sites were active.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/inoculation-site-venues-to-go-up-to-300-in-district/articleshow/81538578.cms||Neha Madaan

The authorities reasoned that the increase was due to the online-MCQ-based model adopted for the examination. Sources said the passing percentage increased by almost 25% compared to the last year. Some senate members have sought offline examinations so that the quality and standard of the examination are maintained. A Board of Examination and Evaluation member of the university, on the condition of anonymity, said the university examinations are quite tough to clear, and generally the pass percentage for all branches put together is around 30%. But, last year, in the October 2020 examination for final year students, the result was between 50% and 100%. “MSc biotechnology, which is a tough course and has generally a pass percentage of 20-22%, had a pass percentage of over 90%. There were cases of students who had failed for several years, passing the examination with almost cent percent marks in the last examination. Hence, it won’t be wrong to say that due to lack of proctoring, students did use unfair means easily to clear the examination hence the increase in pass percentage,” the member said, adding that the condition was the same across the universities in the country. Several questions were raised by senate members about the examinations and if the university saw an exceptional number of students passing the examination. They also wanted to know if there was a proposal under consideration for the university administration to study the reasons for the increase if qualitative changes will be made in the exam system. One of the management council members replied on the behalf of the university that there was indeed a huge increase in the number of students passing the examination in 2020 and this is being studied by a committee. Two Sides To The ProblemThe Examination Reform Committee has already been constituted by the management council to study all this. The structure of the examination in October 2020 was such that 40% of the questions were very easy, 40% of the questions were moderately difficult and the other 20% were difficult to solve. As per the order of the government, 40% of the questions were made available to the students for preparation. Hence it was noticed that the result of the examination increased in an exceptional manner SPPU’s reply to the Senate’s questionThis time we saw a pass percentage increase of 20-25% in the examination results which is very high. The examinations were not proctored and that could have contributed to this increase. We have appointed a committee to study these phenomena. Meanwhile, the upcoming first-semester examination from April 11 will be proctored and hence there will be proper monitoring of students attempting it Sanjay Chakane, member of board of examination and evaluation for the university||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sppu-accepts-exceptional-rise-in-pass-percentage-in-oct-2020-exam/articleshow/81546071.cms||Ardhra Nair

This, in turn, has led to a reduction in sales of anti-infective drugs this fiscal. The monthly sales of anti-infectives India declined by 11.3% and 2.4% in February and January to Rs 1,468 crore and Rs 1,547 crore respectively. The growth rate was 14.1% and 6.7% during the same months last year, shows data compiled by AIOCD AWACS, a market research wing of All India Organization of Chemists and Druggists (AIOCD). The anti-infective segment has struggled since the outbreak of Covid-19 with sales plummeting in 7 out of 11 months so far this fiscal. The sales declined by 20.8%, 9.7%, 10.2% and 11% in May, June, July and August respectively in 2020. The sales, however, showed some recovery with a growth of 6.6% in October and 5.2% in December only. As against this, the segment had seen an average growth of 10% in 2019-20. “Covid-19 pandemic saw an unprecedented awareness among people with regards to hygeine. Less eating out cut down on GI infections, constant wearing of masks cut respiratory infections. Overall, a heightened awareness about cleanliness led to a massive reduction in bacterial infections the whole of pat year and current year too," said Dr Pragnesh Vachhrajani, joint secretary of Family Physicians Association of India. Dr Bharat Gadhavi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals Network Association (AHNA) said apart from complete focus on hygeine which cut infections, planned surgeries which warrant heavy antibiotic also dwindled by 60-70 percent during Covid pandemic. "Overall, barring Covid patients, the number of patients have drastically reduced which reflects in poor sales of anti--infectives," said Dr Gadhavi. “At present, the level of precaution is much higher than what it used to be in pre-Covid time. As a result, cases of several other infections have reduced, which has kept anti-infective drug sales muted,” said Ameesh Masurekar, founding director, AIOCD AWACS. Apart from being a major retail market for medicines, Gujarat is also the top state in pharma production state and accounts for 32-33% of the total pharma production in the country. “Our lifestyles have changed after the pandemic. The awareness about personal health and hygiene has risen. People have started taking medicines to boost immunity. Hence, the cases of several other infections have gone down, which has brought down sales of anti-infectives, especially oral drugs,” said Alpesh Patel, president, Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists’ Association. Industry players also expect the anti-infective therapeutic segment will continue to remain sluggish in days to come as people continue to be cautious amid the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/anti-infective-med-sales-muted-thanks-to-covid-19-precautions/articleshow/81537843.cms||Kalpesh Damor

Usual mode of celebrations, they say, can exponentially increase infections. Earlier this week, the crisis management group of the state government had restricted Holi Milan events in the state. The fresh curbs have come at a time when various states like Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu are recording rise in Covid cases. It is in fact going to be the second consecutive Holi in the shadow of Covid-19 pandemic. Dr T Jacob John, former director of the ICMR’s Centre of Advanced Research in Virology, said avoiding social gatherings in all the festivals in the foreseeable future is mandatory. “The religious aspect of the festival can be solemnised as usual, but unrestricted celebrations and partying joyously should be avoided,” he said, adding use of dry colours should be avoided. “Children and senior citizens should refrain from meeting large number of people, exchanging gifts, shaking hands or consuming cold food or beverages,” John said. Dr Neeraj Nischal, assistant professor of medicine at AIIMS-New Delhi, said people should avoid colours to avoid the spread of coronavirus. “The very crux of the festival is the application of colours on each other by the use of hands. This clearly violates the physical distancing rule which should be followed strictly,” he said. Doctors have also opined that the district administration should intensify vigil on people, especially during the festival. Dr Arun Shah, a Muzaffarpur-based senior paediatrician, said, “There should be strict monitoring of people at public places. Gatherings should not be allowed at all,” he added. Dr Siddharth Kumar, a Patna-based ophthalmologist, said the festival should be celebrated with family members only and in a muted manner. “People whose whereabouts are known and who do not display any kind of Covid symptoms should only be present at family gatherings during Holi. Maintaining Covid appropriate behaviour is necessary,” he said. Citizens too are planning to spend yet another festival indoors. Suman Rajesh, a resident of Kadumkuan, said, “This is now the new normal. Festivals will now be celebrated in this manner for some more time.” Political parties cancel Holi Milan functions: Most political parties in the state have cancelled their Holi Milan events this time in view of the Covid pandemic. Rajib Ranjan, state vice-president of BJP, said the party has not planned Holi celebrations this time. JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad also said the party has decided not to organise Holi events due to the pandemic. RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said the party’s Holi Milan event stands cancelled this time. “We are extra cautious to avoid any future lockdown. We will have a proper Holi-like celebration only when our party president Lalu Prasad is released from jail,” Tiwari added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/health-experts-hold-subdued-holi-celebrations-amid-corona/articleshow/81536893.cms||---

But barely had they understood what was happening, there was more shock for them. The woman’s brother ran behind her and repeatedly dealt her nearly eight to 10 stabs with a knife, in full public view, till she died on the spot. The assailant Premsang Tank did not escape after killing his 22-year-old sister Reena, but walked around the area and the body, screaming, “I have killed my sister, I am not afraid of anyone.” When people told him to stay there till police came, he readily agreed and said he was not going anywhere. Ultimately, Tank surrendered. Preliminary investigation revealed that Tank had killed Reena because she had an affair. The video of Tank walking around his sister’s body and brandishing the knife, recorded by the neighbours, started doing the rounds on social media. Police said Reena had separated from her husband after a few years of marriage. She started living one with Bhavan Jogi in Maruti Nagar area of the coastal town. Moreover, Jogi had been acquitted in the murder of Reena’s father Narubha who was killed in 2014. In fact, the siblings’ mother was also an accused in this case. Her brother lived in the adjoining Mafatnagar area. Saurabh Singh, superintendent of police, Kutch (west), told TOI, “According to preliminary investigation, Tank got frustrated as some people kept passing remarks about his sister’s character. It looks like he suddenly flew into rage and killed her.” J N Panchal, deputy SP, Bhuj said, “There were three accused in the murder but all were acquitted in the case. Tank’s mother was living with him.” M B Jani police inspector of Mundra police station said, “The accused has surrendered himself and we also recovered murder weapon. We are investigating the exact motive of murder.” The accused Premsang was working as construction labour and he had a short temper.

We are confident that it can reach its full potential in the next few years,” said Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla. Magma HDI is a joint venture between Magma Group and German insurer HDI. The latest transaction involves the buyout of existing promoters for Rs 275 crore and an infusion of Rs 250-crore fresh equity in the company. The Poonawallas have invested through group company Cyza Chem and two family offices who are new shareholders in the company. Until recently, Magma HDI’s shares were held by Magma Fincorp (32%), HDI (26%), 18% by Jaguar Advisory Services and by Sanjay Chamria — original promoter of Magma, through investment companies. After the latest deal, Magma Fincorp will hold 24.2%, HDI 17.1%, ICICI Venture 16.7%, Jaguar Advisory 12%, Morgan Stanley PE nearly 10%, Serum Institute 8.2%, Cyza Chem 5.9% and another 5.9% by others, including family offices and employees. A statement issued by Magma HDI said that the fresh infusion of Rs 250 crore will provide growth capital to meet the needs of the expanding distribution capabilities of the company. The secondary sale of Rs 275 crore enables Magma Fincorp and its group companies to comply with the RBI’s guidelines for ownership of a stake in insurance companies. Magma HDI MD & CEO Rajive Kumaraswami said, “The growth capital which the investors bring on board will enable us to expand the business and explore new opportunities. The insurance sector is poised to see exponential growth, given the low penetration and the trigger of the pandemic, which has led people to look at insurance as protection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/poonawallas-icici-venture-others-back-magma-hdi/articleshow/81538630.cms||---

He has also offered to buy 17.5% of Vedanta from public shareholders as against the earlier 10%. The new open offer price — Rs 235 a share — is 47% higher than the previous open offer price of Rs 160 apiece. This is Agarwal’s latest attempt to shore up his holding in Vedanta, a key company of his business empire. The open offer will start on March 23 and close on April 7. Last October, Agarwal had looked at delisting Vedanta from the Indian bourses, but his attempt was unsuccessful. He then acquired Vedanta shares through block deals, thus increasing his stake by 5% to 55%. Later in January, he announced a Rs 5,948-crore open offer to acquire 10% of Vedanta. Securities market Rules allow a promoter with a stake of over 25% but less than 75% to acquire up to 5% stake in his company through creeping acquisition in a fiscal year. For additional share purchases beyond 5%, he will have to launch an open offer. Hence, Agarwal’s latest move. The revised open offer price of Rs 235 is higher than Vedanta’s current trading price. On Tuesday, Vedanta shares closed at Rs 227 on the BSE. The promoter will have to acquire at least half the public shareholding in the company, or 90% of the total equity capital, whichever is higher to become eligible for delisting. In a regulatory filing, Vedanta said the acquirer has decided to increase the number of equity shares to be bought in the open offer to up to 61.5 crore shares, representing 17.5% of the voting share capital — and increase the offer price to Rs 235 per share including interest of Rs 1.29 per equity share.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/vedanta-ups-open-offer-price-by-47/articleshow/81538659.cms||---

From March 17-31, the curfew has been prolonged by two hours and will now be effective from 10 pm to 6 am. The decision struck a discordant note with restaurant owners and traders who cried foul saying that it will impact their businesses adversely. Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA) – Gujarat, said, “The restaurant industry has been bearing the brunt of the government’s curfew decision from the start. When the industry had started showing revival signs, the extension of night curfew timings will again affect the revenues.” The state on Tuesday recorded 954 new cases of Covid-19 taking the total number to 2.8 lakh. Two deaths, both in Ahmedabad, were also reported. Surat reported 263 cases while Ahmedabad recorded 241. Many Covid-19 cases were reported from educational institutions.

---||Patna||Eye on jobs, cabinet nod to ethanol production policy||PATNA: The state cabinet took two major decisions on Tuesday -- approval of the much-awaited ethanol production promotion policy, which will lead to employment generation, and authorising CM Nitish Kumar to recommend 12 names for being nominated to the Bihar legislative council under the governor’s quota. A minister who was present at the meeting told TOI that following the resolution on the recommendation for governor’s quota, the CM indicated that two people to be nominated were already sitting in the cabinet meeting. "Building construction minister Ashok Choudhary and mines and geology minister Janak Ram are certain to be nominated under the governor’s quota as both of them are neither MLAs nor MLCs," the minister said. Altogether 39 proposals from various departments were approved by the cabinet. A senior official said the ethanol production promotion policy was among the major decisions taken at the meeting. The ethanol production promotion policy was floated by the state industries department headed by minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain. "Sugarcane and maize will be the two inputs for ethanol production. While Bihar is rich in sugarcane cultivation, the state also has an abundance of maize. The production of maize is so much in Bihar that at times the farmers struggle to get competitive prices," an official said. According to sources, several districts in Kosi and Seemanchal areas, including Kishanganj, Araria, Katihar, Khagaria, Bhagalpur and Samastipur among others, contribute around 30% of the total yield of maize in the country. Both Nitish and Shahnawaz have held several review meetings on the policy over the past few weeks and hailed ethanol production in the state. They have claimed that it will lure industries and investors, leading to employment generation as well as the betterment of farmers involved in sugarcane and maize cultivation. The production of the fuel-grade chemical would ensure 100% use of ethanol for mixing with petrol. The Centre has been promoting the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme (blending of ethanol with motor spirit to reduce pollution), wherein oil marketing companies sell petrol blended with ethanol up to 10%. Nitish has said on various occasions that the Bihar government had sent a proposal to the Centre in 2007 for setting up ethanol production units in the state, but the proposal was turned down by the then UPA government. He has expressed pleasure that the present central government has approved ethanol production. CM Nitish, in a meeting held on February 25 to review the ethanol promotion policy, had said closed sugar mills can be re-opened and new ones will be opened for ethanol production. Ethanol production policy apart, the resolution by the cabinet to authorise CM Nitish to recommend 12 names for filling the corresponding number of vacant seats in the upper House of the state legislature is also slated to end a long wait for the same. As per constitutional provisions, the governor can nominate 12 out of a total of 75 seats in the legislative council. Out of the 12 seats from the governors’ quota, two fell vacant after former state minister Pashupati Kumar Paras of LJP and JD(U) functionary Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh resigned in May 2019 following their election as members of the Lok Sabha. The remaining 10 seats fell vacant in May last year, after the 10 members nominated by the governor on May 24, 2014, completed their six-year term.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/eye-on-jobs-cabinet-nod-to-ethanol-production-policy/articleshow/81536519.cms||Piyush Tripathi

Headed by Jagat Guru Nanak Dev Punjab State Open University’s VC Karamjeet Singh, the members are on a visit to Bihar in connection with a case relating to the alleged misuse of grants sanctioned to different colleges during the period of the 11th and 12th plans. The team first interacted with PU VC Girish Kumar Chaudhary and the principals of nine colleges who were told to submit the required documents and utilization certificates by March 31. “Some other institutions were granted an April 15 deadline,” PU development officer Parimal Kumar Khan told this newspaper. The principals of 28 JPU and 26 VKSU colleges along with their VCs Faroque Ali and D P Tiwary also met the team members with the relevant documents and explained the reasons behind the non-submission of utilization certificates. They were given additional time to settle all their pending claims. The UGC team left Patna on Tuesday and is now likely to visit Magadh University (MU) and Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU). In 2017, Veteran’s Forum for Transparency in Public Life, an NGO, had filed a PIL in the Patna high court (HC) against universities for not submitting utilization certificates of Rs 287 crore to the UGC since 2007. The court on January 10, 2018 asked PU, MU, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Bihar University, TMBU, Chanakya National Law University, JPU, Lalit Narayan Mithila University, Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University, Bhupendra Narayan Mandal University, and VKSU to file counter affidavits within six weeks. Later, on January 28, 2020 the HC ordered the UGC secretary to physically appear before the court and explain the manner. Recently, the commission decided to get all the cases of utilization of grants examined and settled by sending its team to the universities concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/universities-get-more-time-to-submit-utilisation-certificates/articleshow/81537163.cms||B K Mishra

If you vote for him this time, he will bring the Cauvery itself for which he is working tirelessly,” says Rithanya Priyadarshini, 15, daughter of health minister C Vijaya Baskar, as she goes on the campaign trail with her father, exhorting the voters to give him a chance once again. In Viralimalai constituency, the 15-year-old has been hitting the campaign trail and accompanying her father to gather votes. Campaigning is not new for the school-goer who has been part of it in the previous elections too. His daughter has been helping him in reminding the voters on the schemes that he had brought to the constituency. Standing along with her father in the campaign vehicle with the party flag draped around her neck, Priyadarshini sought the voters to vote for him. As the campaign vehicle passes through the streets, Priyadarshini recalls her father’s contributions and tells the voters that he has been working for the people and would work even harder if they give him another chance. Over the last few days, Vijaya Baskar has been tirelessly campaigning like a new entrant into political, said a party functionary in Viralimalai. He has been seeking votes on the basis of his work in the constituency and as a health minister for the state unlike candidates from the opposition DMK and AMMK who are training guns on him by levelling corruption charges. “She is no novice when it comes to campaigning as last time she was accompanied by mother and younger sister during the local body election,” said a senior party functionary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/min-vijaya-baskars-daughter-15-hits-campaign-trail-again/articleshow/81538584.cms||Sampath Kumar

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: After warmer winter, brace for hotter summer||AHMEDABAD: Many Amdavadis did not feel the need to wear the sweater or drape themselves in the shawls this winter – the reason was apparent, the average maximum temperature for the city remained around 30 degrees Celsius and the minimum around 10 degrees Celsius, resulting in pleasant, but seldom cold weather. “The Gujarat region – minus Saurashtra and Kutch – this winter did not record any cold wave against four to five during the season,” said Manorama Mohanty, in-charge of India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Gujarat. “Saurashtra and Kutch recorded about three to four cold waves from November 2020 to February 2021.” Cold waves signify the sudden drop in temperature along with chilly winds, said IMD officials. Ahmedabad, in fact, recorded a maximum temperature of 34.3 degrees Celsius on December 9, 2020 — the highest temperature recorded in the month in the past five years which was a good 2.9 degrees higher than the average temperature for the day. Why Gujarat did not feel the cold this season? A senior IMD official explained that the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea witnessed multiple cyclones during the winter season this year. Cyclones Gati, Nivar and Burevi were experienced on the Indian coast to varying degrees of severity. “The chill sets in Gujarat once the wind direction becomes northerly. Due to the cyclones, the wind direction took more than usual time to be aligned naturally to the north,” said the official. The phenomenon was however felt across India – according to IMD data, the highest minimum temperature in India in January this year was 21.9 degrees, the warmest in the past 62 years. Central India which includes Gujarat was the warmest in 38 years with average minimum temperature of 14.8 degrees Celsius. State now stares at a harsher summer season. “Based on statistical models, the temperature is all set to be above normal over the region. Saurashtra and Kutch region might record higher temperature rise at 0.06 degrees Celsius compared to forecast of 0.04 degrees Celsius in Gujarat region,” said Mohanty, adding that the forecast is based on long-term average, and thus even a small rise can have significant impact.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-warmer-winter-brace-for-hotter-summer/articleshow/81537802.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Mumbai||Maha to PM: Allow state to make Covaxin at Haffkine||Mumbai: The Maharashtra government on Wednesday raised a demand with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow the state to manufacture the indigenous Covaxin vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech at Mumbai’s Haffkine Institute. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray raised the issue at the PM’s Covid-19 review meeting with all states on Wednesday. Public health minister Rajesh Tope who attended the meeting and later spoke to mediapersons said Modi was positive about this suggestion. According to a statement issued by the Maharashtra government, the PM said institutes in all states that can produce the vaccine will be encouraged to do so. Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh had a meeting with Haffkine’s management regarding the production. A new plant will be set up at the cost of Rs 154 crore at Haffkine to develop the vaccine, said Deshmukh. The manufacture will be undertaken in two phases. In the first, the vaccine will be taken in bulk from the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and repackaged and filled at the Haffkine plant. The second phase, which will entail actual production of the vaccine, will take over a year. A detailed proposal will be soon sent to the Centre for bulk supply of the vaccine from Bharat Biotech and funds to set up the new plant will be sought too. Thackeray sought a technology transfer under the Mission Covid Suraksha from Bharat Biotech to Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation, one of the country’s oldest and premier biomedical research facilities. “If the technology transfer happens, either the vaccine can be produced at Haffkine or they can work on a ‘fill and finish’ arrangement. Nearly 126 million doses can be manufactured at the Haffkine facility,” said Thackeray. “Haffkine has all the required facilities and it will help boost production. The state will also demand 25% of the doses produced at Haffkine be reserved for the state ” said Tope. Thackeray has also demanded that more vaccination centres be permitted in the state and vaccination of all those aged 45 years and below, whether or not they have co-morbidities, be allowed. Thackeray has urged intervention from the National Centre for Disease Control to help the state find out what is causing the surge in cases and the sharp spike in a few districts. Meanwhile, the Centre directed the state to step up testing and tracking. The positivity rate has risen to 16%. “We are testing nearly 1.3 lakh per 10 lakh population and doing over 70% of the tests with RT-PCR. States like UP and Kerala are doing fewer RT-PCR tests and so their positivity rate may be lower,” said Tope.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-to-pm-allow-state-to-make-covaxin-at-haffkine/articleshow/81556841.cms||---

Principal secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar told this newspaper that his department would evaluate the situation till March 22 and take feedback from various educational institutions before taking a call on closing the schools and colleges again. “So far, no decision has been taken regarding the closure of schools and colleges in the state because of rising cases of Covid in other states,” Kumar said. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh on Tuesday held a meeting with officials concerned to intensify the vigil on people coming states having a high number of Covid-19 cases. The DM said two teams of health professionals, including doctors, have been formed to operate at the Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport in coordination with officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI)- Patna. “They will work in two shifts during the flight operations from 6 am to 11 pm. The travellers coming from Kerala, Punjab and Maharashtra have to furnish the Covid-19 negative test report. If they fail to do so, travellers will have to go through Covid testing by the medical team,” the DM said. Singh told this newspaper that three teams each at railway stations, including Patna Junction, and the bus depots at Bankipore and Meethapur are there for a random collection of samples from travellers. “Random testing will be done on such people who are travelling without a mask. The medical team will work round-the-clock at stations and bus depots,” he said. Altogether 3,200 Asha workers and 1,100 ANMs have been deployed at the panchayat and block-levels to make the list of people coming from Punjab, Kerala and Maharashtra. Instructions have also been issued to make arrangements for isolation and quarantine centres in the district. At present, no such centres are functional in Patna district after the Covid-19 cases have dropped across the state. Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said selective quarantine and isolation will be re-opened as there might be a surge in Covid-19 cases. “Besides, testing facilities have been made available at airport and station,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-negative-report-must-for-people-coming-from-three-states/articleshow/81536870.cms||Faryal Rumi

Though villagers said the criminals stabbed the woman to death while committing robbery, police have not ruled out the possibility of insider’s role in the murder. SHO of Manjhagarh police station Deepak Kumar said there was a noose around her neck and blood stains were also found. “Prima facie, no injury mark was found in the woman’s body to suggest that she was stabbed,” he added. Kumar said Geeta’s father has suspected involvement of his daughter’s mother-in-law, Saraswati Devi (55), in the murder. “Saraswati has been detained for interrogation. She is not giving any clear reply. Geeta’s husband Raju Singh was not present at the village at the time of the incident.

Choubey was replying to a query raised by former deputy CM of Bihar Sushil Kumar Modi in Rajya Sabha. “The second AIIMS in the state will benefit the people of north Bihar. However, the state government has to provide 200 acres of land for the same free from all legal wrangling but we are yet to get it,” the minister added. AIIMS at Darbhanga will have 15 to 20 super specialty departments which will not only benefit the people of Darbhanga and the Mithilanchal region but also bordering districts of Nepal and West Bengal among others, the minister said in his reply. He also said that the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) would continue to function separately. The Centre under the same PMSSY has approved a super specialty block to be constructed on DMCH at a cost of Rs 150 crore to upgrade the hospital and over 77% work has already been done. Establishment of a new AIIMS involves creation of a hospital, teaching block for medical and nursing courses, residential complex and allied facilities and services, on the pattern of other AIIMS in the country. The proposed institution would have 750 beds in the hospital which will include emergency and trauma beds, ICU beds, AYUSH beds, private beds, specialty and super specialty beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minister-work-to-upgrade-dmch-near-completion/articleshow/81536448.cms||Faryal Rumi

The UFBU had called the strike to protest against the proposed privatisation of two PSBs. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced in her Budget speech that the government would soon privatise two PSBs. Over 50,000 bank employees in the state skipped work for the second consecutive day on Tuesday. Seven leading bank associations had supported the strike in Bihar. The bank employees took out a protest march in the city from Exhibition Road to Maurya Lok via Gandhi Maidan, Fraser road and Dak Bunglow Crossing. They staged demonstration near Kotwali police station and raised slogans against the government. MLAs from political parties like CPI-ML and CPI-M also joined the protest march. Sanjay Singh, convener of UFBU-Bihar and general secretary of State Bank of India Officers’ Association (Bihar and Jharkhand), said business transactions worth Rs 2,200 crore were affected in the state on Tuesday on account of the strike. “The strike saw 100% participation from all bank employees and senior officials,” he claimed. B Prasad, co-convener of UFBU-Bihar, said 7,000 branches of PSBs, 2,500 of regional rural banks and 6,615 ATM kiosks remained closed across the state. “The banking operations will resume on Wednesday. There will be huge rush of customers at all branches as the banks will reopen after a gap of four days,” Prasad, who is also the state president of Bank Employees’ Federation of India and Bihar Provincial Gramin Bank Employees’ Association, said. Meanwhile, people across the state bore the brunt of the bank strike. Most ATMs ran dry and people were seen making rounds of different banks only to get dejected. Shweta Priya, a resident of Lohanipur, said, “I needed cash to buy groceries. The local stores don’t accept cards and other means of online payment. I tried to withdraw money from four ATMs, but in vain.” Nikhil Shrivastava, a resident of Indirapuri, said at least ATMs should have been replenished with cash during the strike period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/2-day-strike-cripples-banking-services-in-bihar/articleshow/81536930.cms||Faryal Rumi

He may be a fraudster trying to dupe you of your hard earned money by promising to pay the rent if you scan a QR code sent by him. For a couple of years the Mewati gang that specialises in this fraud has become active in Gujarat and begun targeting unsuspecting citizens. In a bid to tackle such cyber frauds, the police department has formed three different teams under the cybercrime police. “We get several complaints of online frauds so I have formed three different teams to focus on different crimes. One team focuses on social media frauds wherein conmen make fake profiles and siphon-off money from people,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner. “The second team is investigating all OTP related frauds where gangs ask for bank account numbers and OTPs by giving some lucrative offers. And the third team is working on different kinds of online financial frauds. Having separate teams for each crime gives them an expertise in understanding the frauds and also ensures speedy investigation,” Singh told TOI. The police said that most cyber frauds below Rs 1 lakh are allotted to the concerned police stations. “We have already started an intensive social media campaign urging people to beware of cyber frauds. Our teams to keep an eye on the social media and try to track such gangs,” Singh added. Cybercrime sleuths said that they have registered nearly 300 online fraud complaints in last one year, many of which have been solved. “Most of these complaints are about some man morphing a woman’s image or starting a fake social media account in her name to harass her. Many of the complaints are about money being siphoned from bank accounts by asking for OTP,” a cybercrime sleuth said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/online-fraudsters-hatch-new-ways/articleshow/81536122.cms||Tushar Tere

Three candidates were initially in the race before results were declared on March 14. Andhra Pradesh State Fibernet Limited (APSFL) chairman P Gowtham Reddy’s daughter P Likitha Reddy was a contender for the post but was defeated in the election. Karimunnesa, who sought the post under the minority quota, was elected as MLC and is out of the race, leaving Bandi Punyaseela, who was earlier YSRC floor leader in Vijaywada Municipal Corporation (VMC), as the only candidate. Avuthu Sailaja Reddy, Chaitanya Reddy and others who won polls with a significant majority have stepped up efforts to convince the party high command but party sources said a BC woman would be given the chance to be mayor in view of social equations. Meanwhile, the government’s decision to appoint two deputy mayors for the city has raised hopes among YSRC corporators in the race to become deputy mayor. YSRC leaders said social equations would be followed in the appointment of deputy mayors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/corporators-intensify-efforts-to-bag-mayors-seat/articleshow/81536601.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Business||Diversity without inclusion causes chaos at workplace||By Mehernosh N Mehta“I can step down the ghats, bathe in the Ganga, walk up to the masjid for namaaz and then head straight to the Balaji temple for riyaz.” These deeply moving words of Ustad Bismillah Khan embody the composite culture of an ancient land and a modern nation — India. Over centuries, people of this great land have always denounced the idea of an exclusive belonging to readily embrace a rich diversity of faith, religion, language, art, music, cuisine, etc, by imbibing from them what they felt was essential for their growth. Indeed, ‘Vividhata ka Samavesh’ — or the ‘Inclusion of Diversity’ — is at the very heart of the idea of India, exclusivist tendencies notwithstanding. One has often wondered as to how this embrace has endured in such a vast and complex land… Has it been consciously adopted by the people as a way of life for their own cultural growth, or has it been driven by leaders over centuries through their sayings and writings? The answer perhaps lies in a mix of both. Inclusion of diversity, sustained and nurtured by an authentic leadership, has led to the creation of a composite culture with values like acceptance, tolerance and care at their very heart. Having said this, one does acknowledge how difficult or easy it is to facilitate such a culture — more so in an organisation. Let me give you two illustrations to highlight this point. As a young HR professional, my first adventure, or rather misadventure, of embracing diversity with inclusivity came through in an earlier organisation I was working for. We had a typical problem of high attrition and dearth of talent in one of the core functions of the organisation. Business blamed it on HR, and HR never failed to reciprocate the compliments. This ping-pong halted only when one realised that we had failed to cast the talent net wide enough for us to tap into various sources that were readily available. One such barrier was the ban on entry of women professionals in that function. It was a strange sight to be going to many colleges and universities across India to recruit students only to pleadingly apologise with them that women were still not welcome in that part of the organisation. Imagine our horror when we were repeatedly told by these colleges that the best students in their class were women. We decided to take the bull by the horns. The usual appreciative inquiry was carried out with leaders across the function and all kinds of reasons and excuses (the usual suspects) were put forth by the very ‘gentle’ men as to why women could not be recruited. While the entry on women professionals was finally lifted, nay, pushed down from the top, we failed to realise that including them into the organisation was equally important. Diversity had failed to be embraced by inclusivity, resulting in many cases of harassment and inappropriate behaviour. So obsessed were we by the goal of breaking this barrier, that a focused approach to inclusion was never thought necessary. This created a culture of conflicts and chaos. The leadership and HR had missed the woods for the trees. Contrast this with what happened during the 26/11 terror attack at the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai in 2008. Not one Taj employee abandoned the hotel and ran away. They helped the guests escape and, in the process, many died. Prof Rohit Deshpande from Harvard, while working on a case study, interviewed many employees, company and HR leaders to understand this behaviour. He studied the HR policies and practices of the organisation. His findings were deeply insightful. Taj did not recruit their employees from big cities like Mumbai and Delhi, but from smaller ones where traditional culture of ‘Atithi devo bhava’ still holds very strong. They recruited for attitude, not marks, by speaking with school heads to find out who were most respectful of their parents, elders, teachers and others. They trained their employees to be the voice of their guests to the organisation and not the other way around. Their reward policy was designed in such a way that whenever a guest would be delighted by an employee, he/she would be personally recognised by the organisation in less than 48 hours. Taj had broken several myths that the ‘best’ talent is available only in the cities, that marks and grades are the best measure of such talent and that employees are only supposed to be brand ambassadors of their organisation to the guests. By consciously recruiting from the smaller cities and towns, it not only tapped an untapped talent pool but readily embraced this diversity by an inclusive approach supported by a focused learning and reward strategy. The organisation, its leadership and the HR team sent out a very authentic message to its employees that ‘We care’ for you. In return, the most ordinary people ended up doing extraordinary things, even at the cost of their lives. The employer-employee relationship was re-defined like never before. Authentic leadership always includes diversity. It nurtures and sustains it to build a composite culture. Organisations of today need many more Bismillah Khans in their leadership and ranks.

The ASI, Vijay Kumar, was physically present before the bench of Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad along with Gopalganj SP Anand Kumar, sadar DSP Naresh Paswan and food safety officer. The court was hearing matters related to seizure of four pan masala-laden trucks in Gopalganj on September 11 and September 19 last year. The court observed that only after sensing trouble, an application was hurriedly filed in a Gopalganj court last month seeking permission for sending sample of seized pan masala to district food inspector for laboratory test to ascertain presence of any prohibited item. Manufacture, sale, distribution and transportation of pan masala or gutka containing nicotine or tobacco is banned in Bihar. The high court was also surprised to know that due to lack of space, trucks were kept in open and their silencers and 180 packets pan masala were stolen. The high court has asked state government to reply if transportation of such items through Bihar to a state where there is no such ban is also prohibited. The court has also asked the government to make it clear who would pay compensation for theft of seized items. The matter will now be heard in the high court on March 26. Consignment proprietors Kabir Singh and Brahma Nand Puri had filed criminal writ petitions in the high court, urging it to quash both FIRs and order release of seized goods and vehicles. Two Meghalaya-bound trucks were seized at Manjhagarh in Gopalganj. Two other trucks, on the other hand, were seized under the Town police station area in Gopalganj. These two trucks were bound for Siliguri. All the four trucks were loaded in Delhi. Another criminal writ petition in nature of habeas corpus on alleged illegal arrest of the drivers of the two trucks is being heard by a division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar. The DGP has been asked to file personal affidavit on the matter as the bench was dissatisfied with Gopalganj SP’s reply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/seizure-of-pan-masala-gopalganj-cop-draws-hc-ire-for-hasty-action/articleshow/81537190.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The Lalu Prasad-led party is contesting the Tinsukia seat, dominated by Hindi-speaking people, in the first phase as part of seat-sharing among the eight allies of the Congress-led Grand Alliance. The RJD is hopeful of getting one more seat – Gauhati West – in the third phase. Assam goes to polls in three phases on March 27, April 1 and 6. In Tinsukia, RJD candidate Hira Devi is locked in a direct contest with BJP’s Sanjoy Kishan, who is also the Assam’s labour and tea tribe welfare minister. Kishan belongs to the tea tribe community while Hira Devi has a strong base in Tinsukia assembly seat. As the Tinsukia constituency is dominated by the Hindi-speaking community, different political parties had given tickets to Hindi-speaking candidates in the past. Voting in Tinsukia constituency will be held in the first phase on March 27. “How can we forget the harassment caused to the Hindi-speaking people in Assam, especially in Tinsukia district, during the process of updating of the NRC. Hundreds of Hindi-speaking families were harassed. We are visiting the Hindi and Bhojpuri-speaking families having roots in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and requesting them to recall how they were harassed by the BJP-led government in Assam,” RJD’s Tinsukia unit president Mohan Sah, who has his roots in Bihar, told TOI over phone on Tuesday. “Genuine Indian citizens should not be harassed in the name of unconstitutional ‘doubtful category’ of voters as part of the NRC. We will also oppose the CAA,” RJD’s Assam state president Shonarul Shah Mustafa told TOI over the phone on Tuesday. Mustafa said the RJD also wants that the flood erosion problem of Assam is declared a ‘national problem’ and boundary issues of the state are resolved immediately. RJD’s Tinsukia candidate Hira Devi has prepared a two-page ‘Sankalp Patra’ in which she has highlighted 33 local issues related to Tinsukia constituency and the tea tribe community. She meets people with her ‘Sankalp Patra’ and promises to work for fulfilment of the 33 issues, if the Congress-led alliance comes to power in Assam. Besides supporting the demand of establishment of a university in Tinsukia district and converting all schools of tea gardens into government schools, Hira Devi, in her Sankalp Patra, has also promised to raise the daily wage of tea garden workers to Rs 365 from the existing Rs 165.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/assam-polls-rjd-to-highlight-nrc-caa-issues/articleshow/81537135.cms||Madan Kumar

From March 17-31, the curfew has been prolonged by two hours and will now be effective from 10 pm to 6 am. The decision struck a discordant note with restaurant owners and traders who cried foul saying that it will impact their businesses adversely. Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA) – Gujarat, said, “The restaurant industry has been bearing the brunt of the government’s curfew decision from the start. When the industry had started showing revival signs, the extension of night curfew timings will again affect the revenues.” The state on Tuesday recorded 954 new cases of Covid-19 taking the total number to 2.8 lakh. Two deaths, both in Ahmedabad, were also reported. Surat reported 263 cases while Ahmedabad recorded 241. Many Covid-19 cases were reported from educational institutions. On Tuesday, of the total 263 cases reported in Surat, 39 Covid-19 cases were reported from schools and colleges. In Vadodara, 10 teachers and one student are currently undergoing treatment for Covid-19 after their samples for coronavirus tested positive. In all, 25 teachers have tested positive ever since the schools reopened. In the wake of rising numbers, Surat Municipal Corporation slapped a slew of curbs including closing down of all public gardens and taking off as many as 300 public transport buses off the city roads. The Sarthana Nature Park and Zoo too was ordered shut for public till further orders. The SMC also mandated weekly testing of people associated with textile and diamond industries. “Daily checking with a pulse oximeter (to measure oxygen saturation level) will also be mandatory,” stated the SMC release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/night-curfew-now-from-10pm-in-4-major-guj-cities-till-march-31/articleshow/81541681.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Taken first shotbut no SMS yet,complain citizens||Aurangabad: A number of beneficiaries who have taken the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine have complained that they have not received SMS from the central server, creating confusion and upsetting their travel plans. The SMS carries the online link for downloading the provisional vaccination certificate and helpline number, both of which are vital for taking the second dose. One of the affected beneficiaries, who took the first jab on March 4, said he needed the provisional vaccination certificate for travelling abroad.“I inquired with different authorities but failed to get a satisfactory response. I was not expecting such a lapse when everything was supposed to be online,” he said, preferring anonymity. The beneficiaries who opted for walk-ins at vaccination centres were found to have among those who did not get the official message. Another beneficiary, a senior citizen, said she may face issues getting the second-dose. “I have no proof to show that my second dose is due on a particular day as I have not received any SMS. Considering crowding at vaccination centres, I may face issues in getting the second dose,” she said. Close to 49,000 beneficiaries have so far received their first dose of the vaccine within the municipal limits of Aurangabad. When contacted, civic health officer Megha Jogdand on Tuesday said technical glitches in the CoWin app along with manpower related issues have led to some beneficiaries not getting official SMS after vaccination. “Even if some beneficiaries have not received an SMS after the first dose, their credentials are recorded in the online system and they are bound to get the message carrying the link for provisional certificate after the second dose,” she said.Jogdand said those in need of provisional certificate for urgent reasons will be issued hard copies through the AMC. “Some vaccination data could not be entered into the system due to a lack of manpower. The issue is being addressed by roping in manpower,” said the health officer. Jogdand said that no beneficiary will face any difficulty in getting the second dose of the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/taken-first-shotbut-no-sms-yetcomplain-citizens/articleshow/81537336.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The members of the team in the OT clicked photographs and video of the surgery and posted them on social media and ended inviting action as they went viral soon. Taking serious note of the incident, the university administration constituted a team to probe the matter after serving notices to each person present in the OT at the time of surgery, said Prof Vinay Kumar Srivastava, dean of dental science faculty, Institute of Medical Science-BHU, which has been given the status of AIIMS-like institution, on Tuesday. A photo showing doctors conducting dental surgery in flashlight of mobile phones of two assistants went viral on social media. The dental science faculty staff said the surgery of the patient had been scheduled for the day earlier and started following opening of the OT at 10am on Monday. After some time, powercut took place and alternative light arrangements did not function. Since the doctors had started surgery, the supporting staff switched on the flashlights of their mobile phones to complete the surgery. When contacted dean on Tuesday he said, “The notification for powercut in the surgical wing for some maintenance and other works had been issued 15 days ago. Despite issuance of this notification, the OT was opened for surgeries. And, instead of informing me, photos were circulated in social media.” “It is a serious lapse,” said Srivastava, adding, each member present in the OT has been served notice and a team has been constituted for thorough investigation of the episode. Action would be taken as per the report of the committee, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bhu-docs-face-probe-for-conducting-dental-surgery-in-flashlight/articleshow/81537351.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||SC asks Telangana high court to hear afresh Kaleshwaram compensation case||HYDERABAD: Setting aside orders delivered by Telangana high court on compensation for certain parts of land for the mega Kaleshwaram irrigation project’s chain of reservoirs, the Supreme Court on Tuesday sent the case back to the high court to hear it afresh on March 26. According to state officials, the case will now be heard by a bench headed by Chief Justice Hima Kohli. The apex court’s decision came following submissions made by the state government that a division bench of the high court in July 2020 hurriedly passed the judgment during the pandemic without hearing the argument of the advocate general. The high court in its July 2020 judgment directed the state to freshly acquire the land under the new land acquisition act. It also directed the state to pass separate compensation awards for the land and residential houses, and asked the state to recognise every major member of the family who crosses the age of 18 as a separate family unit and accordingly grant them a separate rehabilitation package. The bench also censured Siddipet district collector and other officials and directed the state to record adverse noting in their service records for the scant regard they had shown towards the orders of the court. The state preferred an appeal against this order. The state argued before a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising Justice A M Khanvilkar, Dinesh Maheswari and Krishna Murari that the high court did not take into consideration the pandemic situation where the state counsel was finding it difficult to upload voluminous record to place it before the virtual court. “It requires a lot of assistance from the revenue officials to the state counsel which was not possible due to lockdown conditions,” the plea said. The state also expressed a grievance over a part of the order that asked it to reopen the cases of those farmers who sold their land to the state under GO 123 in 2016. “Reopening them after five years is a difficult task for the state,” the state counsel argued before the apex court. Though the high court itself said that only urgent matters should be heard during the pandemic, these cases were pressed by the counsel for the petitioners and the bench passed the orders without giving the chance for the advocate general to put forward his case, the state argued before the apex court. The bench requested the HC to decide the matter after hearing the AG on March 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sc-asks-high-court-to-hear-afresh-kaleshwaram-compensation-case/articleshow/81539884.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Agreements for redevpt under Mhada to be tripartite||MUMBAI: All redevelopment agreements for buildings in Mhada layouts will have to be tripartite agreements now. This will include the housing society, developer and Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority (Mhada). Till now such agreements were signed with society residents and developer. Mhada as landowner merely issued the NOC for redevelopment. The state housing department on Tuesday issued a GR on the change. Mhada has 56 layouts in Mumbai, and since 2018 has been planning authority solely for redevelopment of old and dilapidated buildings in its layouts. Redevelopment of Mhada buildings is governed by regulation 33(5) of Development Control and Promotion Regulations, 2034. Mhada constructs residential buildings mainly for economically weaker, low income and middle income groups that are allotted to citizens on lottery basis. The land is leased to the co-operative housing society formed by residents. Since many buildings are old and dilapidated, many housing societies opted for redevelopment. But in many cases, redevelopment has been stuck for many years, leaving many families homeless and in dire financial straits. “Since Mhada only issues an NOC, in case of violation of agreement conditions, it can do nothing to aid redevelopment. Not only are redevelopment projects stuck for years, even issues of paying rent cannot be resolved. Hence, tripartite agreements will now be mandatory,” the GR stated. Indian Institute of Architects (Mumbai Centre) members called it unnecessary government interference. “Most projects are stuck due to poor government policies, which are not framed well, open to all kinds of interpretation and keep changing. Government needs to fix its policies, mean what it says and ensure policies are clear-cut,” said members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/agreements-for-redevpt-under-mhada-to-be-tripartite/articleshow/81539916.cms||Clara Lewis

The stretch, located adjacent to the Masab Tank main road, is home to rows of residential properties and commercial establishments, apart from banquet halls. The citizen reporter, Venkat Reddy, who brought the issue to the notice of officials through TOI’s app said that the garbage has been left uncleared for the last 10 days. “I noticed that the garbage was left scattered on the road for at least 10 days,” said Reddy echoing the fear of other locals about such issues leading to rise in diseases in the area. “The place has become a garbage dumping point. When the garbage was not being removed, we feared that it would lead to vector-borne diseases,” said Abdul Aleem, a resident of Masab Tank. “Strays used to scatter the garbage all over the place. Mosquito menace and rancid smell were primary concerns,” he added. According to officials the garbage was removed from multiple places but people have started dumping waste there, again. “I had the waste removed from various places. But by the next day, garbage was piled up again,” said MK Ali, deputy commissioner, GHMC of Mehdipatnam. The garbage is piling up also because civic officials have removed the existing bins ahead of Swachh Survekshan Rankings 2021. This, as bins installed on roads carry negative marks in Swachh Survekshan. Municipal corporations that follow the bin-free city concept, by pressing into service vehicles to collect garbage from households will secure better rank as per Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.

A forest official said the calf might have fallen from a height and died while the male elephant died after infighting. Meanwhile, veterinarians are trying to save the male elephant which suffered serious injuries after hit by a speeding train. The decaying carcass of the calf was found by tribals at Boluvampatti block-III reserve forest in Coimbatore forest range when they went to collect forest products. After being informed, forest officials and assistant veterinary surgeon Karthikeyan went to the spot, which is 5km inside the forest, and carried out the postmortem. The carcass was later left in the forest for scavengers. The male elephant was found at Kavarkal in Valparai forest range in Pollachi forest division by a team of forest officials on a patrol. After conducting the postmortem, veterinarians said the elephant could have died after a fight with a male elephant at least five days ago. Meanwhile, the 25-year-old tusker which was hit by a speeding train in Madukkarai forest range early Monday morning was shifted to the Chadivayal elephant camp on the same night.

This is the first time that experts have come out with guidelines on DILI for the Asia Pacific region as the caseload increases here. The consequences of DILI may vary from being asymptomatic to self-limiting illnesses to severe liver injury leading to acute liver failure, and its incidence is likely to be more common in Asia than other parts of the world. The consensus guidelines on DILI is a concise account of the various aspects including current evidence-based information on DILI in Asia and is published in the medical journal Hepatology International. “We have collated the complete data and come out with guidelines for the Asia Pacific region. DILI is an underdiagnosed and underappreciated causal or contributing factor to liver injury. Diagnosis of DILI is challenging not only by the lack of specific objective diagnostic tests but also by the low incidence and suspicion for the diagnosis in the first place,” said Dr Cyriac Abby Philips of The Liver Institute, Center of Excellence in GI Sciences, Rajagiri Hospital, Aluva. Dr Philips participated in the preparation of the guidelines. The aim of bringing out guidelines is to provide hepatologists, gastroenterologists, internists and other clinical healthcare providers with information about DILI with emphasis on agents that will enhance awareness, aid diagnosis and help the management of patients with DILI. Asia is home to seven of the top 10 countries with TB burden. India accounts for about a quarter of the global TB burden. In 2018, the estimated TB incidence was 2,690,000 and in March 2017 the Government of India announced a new aim to eliminate TB by 2025. Kerala’s TB incidence rate is 67 per 100,000 population as against the all-India rate of 138 per 100,000 population. The first-line drugs used in the treatment of tuberculosis are a major cause of DILI, the guidelines state. The guidelines noted that “traditional and complementary medicines are indigenous to the culture of a number of countries and are often integrated into the health system of these countries”. More at increased risk of developing DILI are those with advanced age. “Earlier it was considered that anti-TB drugs were the number one cause of DILI in India and other Asian countries. But now the trend is changing and there is increasing evidence that alternative and complementary medicines also cause DILI. But this is not just in India but all over Asia,” said Dr Philips. “The problem with untested traditional medicines is that there is no specific treatment available. Either the patient recovers spontaneously or their condition can worsen, with patients requiring either liver dialysis or transplant,” added Dr Philips.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/anti-tb-drugs-traditional-meds-can-harm-liver-experts/articleshow/81537356.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Lucknow||UP: One-day BJP executive panel meeting deviated from many past traditions||LUCKNOW: The state executive committee of the BJP concluded in just one day against the tradition of members holding brainstorming sessions for two to three days. Some members also voiced their dissatisfaction that there were no resolutions on political and current affairs, agriculture and economy.  In the past, such meetings always brought in resolutions on different subjects and the members deliberated and adopted a resolution to draw a roadmap for the party’s future plans and programmes. Vice-president of the BJP Daya Shankar Singh though said that when the party is in power its role is to carry the government’s message to the people and showcase its performance and when in Opposition, it has a different role. Therefore, there was no need for adopting political and economic resolutions. Also, he said, the executive committee was actually for two days. On the first day, the office-bearers of the organisation had their separate meeting and the main conference was held on the second day. A section of the BJP office-bearers and executive members wanted to take up the issue of the high court rejecting the new reservation system in the state’s panchayat elections and the delay in holding them as well as the panchayats being run by administrators. Former MLA from Ballia, Ram Iqbal Singh, also attempted to raise the issue of corruption at the lower level in administration. Some members said that since hardly a year is left for the next assembly elections, the party should adopt political resolutions. Those who wanted detailed discussion in the state executive committee meeting lamented that the entire exercise of the conference turned into praising the government and taking its achievements to the public, while ignoring the main role of keeping a watch on the functioning of the state government and drawing a roadmap for the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/one-day-bjp-executive-panel-meeting-deviated-from-many-past-traditions/articleshow/81539851.cms||Subhash Mishra

Though the city recorded an average 11% dip in particulate matter 2.5 levels, the overall pollution levels in Hyderabad was above the norms prescribed by World Health Organisation (WHO) in 61.7% of the days. This, in other words, means every two of three days or eight months of the 12 months in a year, the city had bad air quality. Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to annual data on air quality compiled by IQAir in the form of the World Air Quality Report 2020 covering 4.700 cities across the globe, the pollution levels in Hyderabad are bad but not worse when compared with several major cities in India. Hyderabad does not figure in the top 15 most polluted cities in India. “Hyderabad recorded an average 11% dip in PM 2.5 levels. However, the pollutant levels were above the WHO prescribed limit in 61.7% of the days,” the report said. adding that Hyderabad’s annual average stands at 34.7 micrograms per cubic metre. This is three times the prescribed limit by WHO. None of the Indian cities met the prescribed annual limit of 10 µg/m3. This includes Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam. Also, Hyderabad’s PM 2.5 levels in December 2020 surpassed the January 2020 levels, indicating that the ‘better air quality’ has already faded away. While the improvement seems to be encouraging from a data point of view, its health and economic cost remain severe, the report warned. According to the report, south Indian cities recorded relatively better air quality and remained above the daily WHO limits of 25 µg/m3 for most parts of 2020. Last year, all Indian cities monitored observed air quality improvements compared to 2018, while 63% saw improvements compared with 2019. However, India continues to feature prominently at the top of the most polluted cities ranking, with 22 of the top 30 most polluted cities globally. Avinash Chanchal, climate campaigner at Greenpeace India, said the report indicated that citizens from south Indian cities like Hyderabad are also breathing polluted air.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-had-bad-air-quality-8-months-last-year-says-report/articleshow/81538607.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Kochi||Kerala assembly elections: Walayar mother takes on Pinarayi Vijayan||THRISSUR: The mother of the two minor dalit sisters who were asexually assaulted and murdered in Walayar in 2017 on Tuesday announced her decision to contest as an independent candidate against chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan at his home turf, Dharmadam in the upcoming assembly elections. Congress, which was looking to field a heavyweight candidate in the constituency, said it will support the independent candidate. “We have decided not to field our own candidate but will assure full support to the mother of the Walayar sisters,” said KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran. After picking K Muraleedharan to contest from Nemom, the Congress leadership was under pressure to find a strong candidate in Dharmadom to take on Pinarayi and C K Padmanabhan, fielded by BJP. Though the party top leadership held discussions with several senior leaders requesting them to take up the task, none of them had agreed to it. “If I get elected I would continue my fight in the assembly seeking justice for my daughters and for all the women who have suffered various forms of exploitations and suppression. If I’m defeated, I will go back to the agitation tent at Walayar, and continue my struggle,” the mother of the Walayar girls said. A march led by her which was launched from Kasaragod to mobilise public support for her demand to take action against the police officers who had allegedly sabotaged the case reached Thrissur on Tuesday. She said she chose to enter the electoral fray as a mark of protest against the government for not taking action against those who played a critical role in scuppering the case. “The chief minister, who is also the home minister should be held responsible for it. That is why I’m contesting against the chief minister,” she said. Asked about the UDF extending support to her, she said she will welcome assistance from any section other than Sangh Parivar outfits. Leaders including C R Neelakandan who were accompanying her said the protest march will end in Thrissur and that she will go to Dharmadam for kicking off the election campaign. Reacting to the development, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday brushed aside the woman’s claims that the government did not do enough to secure justice for her. Speaking at a press conference in Kannur, he said: “We don’t have anything to feel guilty about. Certain people are misleading her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/walayar-mother-takes-on-pinarayi/articleshow/81538621.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC declines bail to builder duo & quashing of laundering case||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Tuesday rejected a bail application filed by Omkar Group promoters Babulal Verma and Kamal Kishore Gupta in connection with an alleged money laundering case. Justice A S Gadkari also rejected their plea to quash the Enforcement Directorate case registered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), holding that once such investigation is initiated, it is independent of any scheduled offence. The judge said neither compounding nor closure of the original first information report (FIR) of a scheduled offence would affect the PMLA probe. The duo, represented by counsel Vijay Agrawal, had argued for bail and quashing on the ground that once the very basis of a PMLA case is gone, the case must too. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh and Hiten Venegaonkar, appearing for ED, though, had argued that once the agency records its Enforcement Case Information Report ( ECIR) , the non-existence of the original FIR would not impair or impede its probe. The developers had filed a petition before HC under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to invoke the court’s “inherent power to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under this code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.’’ Last month, a special PMLA court had rejected their bail plea. The duo said since a magistrate in Aurangabad has accepted a closure report filed in an alleged cheating case, the FIR against them on the basis of which the ED had registered a separate PMLA case would no longer hold good. The closure report had an affidavit by the original informant which stated that the matter was amicably resolved. In its order last month, the trial court, while denying them bail, had said “accepting the C-Summary final report or compounding of a scheduled offence will not lead to automatic nullification of acts done by the accused under PMLA.’’ The HC judgment, yet to be uploaded, was also of the opinion that acceptance of a closure report by a magistrate cannot stop ED investigation into the PMLA case. ED had initiated the investigation on the basis of an FIR registered by Aurangabad police under sections 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of Indian Penal Code against Omkar Group promoters. ED had said investigation under PMLA revealed loans to the tune of Rs 410 crore were diverted other than for the intended purpose. It said no work of an SRA project building was undertaken and requisite rules and procedure were ignored by the accused, and documents relating to slum dwellers were forged to claim more FSI to mortgage it with banks for loans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-declines-bail-to-builder-duo-quashing-of-laundering-case-in-mumbai/articleshow/81538869.cms||Swati Deshpande

Police have recovered more than Rs 70 lakh. Vinit Bhardwaj, a graduate, was running an events management company and was also into property dealing. His father works at Delhi Transport Corporation. Complainant Amit Tibrawal told police that a person named Sunny had promised to arrange a Rs 4-crore office space for just Rs 2 crore as the owner needed money urgently and mostly in cash. Tibrawal arranged for Rs 1 crore in cash, but when he went to Sunny’s office in Mahavir Enclave on March 11, his aides, Bhardwaj, Deepak Sharma and Prem Lal, met the CA and insisted that they would first count the cash, said DCP (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh. After counting the cash, they kept it in an adjoining room on the pretext of safety, and siphoned it off after entering the room through the next building, the DCP said. It has been found that Sunny’s real name is Mohammad Imam Khan. Following a tip-off, Rs 70.4 lakh was recovered from the house of his relative in Inderpuri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ca-duped-of-rs-1cr-with-promise-of-office-space-at-cheaper-rate/articleshow/81557952.cms||---

When Khanna was addressing a press conference at Tilak Hall on Tuesday to announce an interest waiver scheme for traders, Mittal and GST commissioner Amrita Soni were accompanying him. While reading out facts and figures how the state successfully survived the economic slowdown without any cut in salaries or pension of the government staff, the finance minister praised Mittal for professionally scripting the UP budget for the financial year 2021-22 and leading the government challenge during the slowdown days. Just a fortnight before the presentation of the state budget on February 21, Mittal was shifted from his post of ACS, finance to the state tax in the same capacity. However, last fortnight Mittal staged his comeback by getting the portfolio of additonal chief secretary, industry and IIDC and was also handed over the basic education department as the incumbent Renuka Kumar went on 15 days’ leave and is likely to take up her Central deputation soon. The post of IIDC assumes much significance particularly the way Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is pursuing the agenda of industrial development in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/finance-min-hails-acs-mittal-for-tackling-slowdown-in-up/articleshow/81539885.cms||Subhash Mishra

They said the lockdown and the work from home routine have disturbed people’s sleep routines and body rhythms.“People are taking daytime naps, spending too much time in front of gadgets or working late into the night,” said one of the psychologists.Psychologists said they were seeing an increase in new patients with anxiety, panic, or depression, many of which first manifest as or cause by sleep issues.Monika Jasmine, a psychologist with Mounam counselling centre, said, “We have people with depression or anxiety issues, despite having less work. More than 90% describe sleep disorders as one of the symptoms. In more than 80% of depression, anxiety and panic cases, inadequate sleep is one of the main causes.” She was speaking at a function that was organized by the Indian Medical Association at Ganga Nursing College Auditorium on Tuesday.Another psychologist, Lakshmi Priya, said, “We think the resulting blue light and late working hours are affecting people’s sleep. Many people don’t get the required seven to nine of hours of sleep, which includes non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep. Both are required for our physiological and psychological functions, repair of muscles and growth of tissues, in addition to process information. We also find people taking long nap because of boredom and that affects their night sleep.”Psychologists have recommended people to create a night-time routine and follow sleep hygiene. “Turn off gadgets an hour earlier, dim lights and change the work and day clothes before going to bed. Slowly, your mind will start recognizing it and the brain will start secreting melatonin. Hygiene includes using your bed only for sleeping, switching off all lights and allowing your body to be in the right temperature, which can’t be too cold or heat,” Priya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/lockdown-triggered-sleep-disorders-among-more-people/articleshow/81538620.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Releasing a 20-point manifesto of Tamil Nadu farmhands’ agri-business in Trichy, its coordinator T Gurusamy said parties must have a vision for the development of the agriculture sector and ensure profitable price for produces. “Being an apolitical council, we request the party going to form the government, be it DMK or AIADMK, to keep farmers’ welfare as priority,” Gurusamy said. He said the support extended by some farmers’ associations to political parties does not reflect the stand of a large section of farmers. The council discussed steps to make agriculture profitable by implementing minimum support price (MSP) for produces. It called for introspection as to why a large section of people living in rural pockets does not find agriculture profitable. The manifesto termed the average annual income of Rs 6,426 of an agrarian family as assessed by Niti Aayog in 2014 a national shame. The farming community leaders rued the lack of public investment of the government in infrastructure for agriculture sector leading to waste of agriculture produces despite the country being surplus in food production. The manifesto also discussed in detail the shortcomings in common procurement of agriculture produces and holes in PDS. Other senior leaders who took part were Mahadhanapuram Rajaram, G S Dhanapathi, K V Ilangeeran and Sundara Vimalanathan among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-associations-release-poll-manifesto/articleshow/81538608.cms||---

Of these, 1,08,556 doses have been shown as administered till March 15.Ayush Prasad, the ZP’s CEO, said, “The mismatch is due to delay in giving information of doses by the private hospitals. Some hospitals haven’t given us this information in time. A data entry operator has been appointed for follow-ups with these hospitals on daily basis.” Private hospitals’ representatives claimed they often encountered problems with the CoWIN app during the vaccination sessions in morning hours. “We have to update the batch number of each vial in the system. Often, it doesn’t work or takes a lot of time. We also need to provide details of vaccination thrice a day to the ZP authorities,” said Dr Vinayak Gawali, the head of Apex hospital in Rajgurunanagar.“If the system doesn’t work, we maintain the record of beneficiaries on paper and later update it. Sometimes, we fail to open the session. Hence, we couldn’t submit the daily records with the ZP,” said a doctor of another private hospital.

---||Pune||Pune: Drink, pay, leave... Curbs deny bar patrons time to chill||PUNE: Timing restrictions as well as limits on the number of patrons in bars is killing the buzz of wining and dining out in the city. The restaurant/bar business has turned into a race against time to generate as much revenue in as little time, even if it means not letting customers settle down with their drink. Relaxing at a bar with a chilled mug of beer or a peg of whisky now remains a distant memory — an indication of how the pandemic has changed yet another aspect of our lives. The restrictions include pulling down shutters by 10pm and operating at 50% occupancy. “I visited some bars recently and the experience was not good at all. Waiters now want people to gulp down their drinks. If you are having a beer, the waiters tend to push you to drink fast, pay up and leave. People go to a bar to relax and have a drink or two. That element is missing now,” says Kondhwa resident Sanjay Amble. “It is very uncomfortable if waiters keep staring at you all the time and indirectly ask you to leave. Since my mother-in-law is visiting, I cannot drink at home on weekends. But a visit to the bar made me extremely self-conscious and restless,” said Hadapsar resident Kiran Pradhan. Two working professionals hit a bar at Salunkhe Vihar Road late on Saturday evening. However, since they had reached only by 9:30pm, enjoying their drinks was not possible. “We tried to finish work early but that was not possible. We had decided to have some beers but almost as soon as we sat down, we were told that the bar will close by 10.15pm. How can you drink and relax while looking at your watch?” asked one of the men. The waiter at the same bar said that he was helpless. “We open at 7pm and have to close by 10pm. Business is down, and we need to ensure that we can serve as many guests as we can. So, the focus is obviously on those spending more,” he said. The manager of the bar said, “More than 70% of the daily income has dried up.

Pawar declared that the MVA government will extend full support to the NIA, which has taken over the probe in the car explosives case. “All is well. No, there will be no adverse impact on the government in the wake of the Sachin Waze episode. If any official is misusing his position, he will be shown his place. The government will act against such officials firmly. In fact, the NIA has stepped in for the purpose,” Pawar said. Deputy CM Ajit Pawar said, “No one will be spared. The government will not protect anyone.” Pawar said that initially, the Anti-Terrorism Squad was probing the incident and now NIA has stepped in. We will extend full cooperation to the NIA. I am sure the NIA will expose those police officials who were misusing their official position,” he said. Pawar expressed surprise when mediapersons asked him if there was a proposal to sack home minister Anil Deshmukh. “This is news to me, there is no such proposal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaino-threat-to-mva-pawar-no-one-will-be-spared-ajit/articleshow/81538634.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Delhi||Step out... to the city’s own hanging gardens||NEW DELHI: Among the most important things to have emerged from an utterly forgettable 2020 has to be the reconnect with nature. People realised they had to bring nature home rather than commune with greenery only on weekend breaks. So many in the urban juggles lined their stairs with plants, added climbers to balconies and turned their terraces into gardens. From hiring gardeners and buying plants to browsing how-to videos and surfing the internet for ideas on developing indoor green spaces, people in increasing numbers are continuing to get hooked to green zones in domestic environs. And these efforts do bear flowery and fruity results. Media person Irene Gupta’s terrace in south Delhi’s Chittaranjan Park is the best example of it. From around 20 variety of flowers to fruits such as guava and grapes and seasonal veggies, there’s a lot sprouting in the 500 sq ft rooftop space. After her quaint bungalow made way for builder flats, Gupta decided to restore the green spaces the house originally had. With the help of a gardener, and inspiration from online tutorials, she has come a long way from a handful of flowers to almost 35kg of terrace-grown vegetables. For communications professional Niharika Razdan, the terrace farm nurtured by her parents for years became a personal sunset spot to unwind with music during the Covid-19 lockdown. Terming their terraces as their “retreat”, both Gupta and Razdan assert that gardening or farming is not a day’s job. Razdan said a full-fledged terrace farm with almost 150 plants involved more to it than watering the plants twice a day. Gupta pointed out the need to be able to determine how much weight to put on the rooftop, find lighter soil substitutes such as cocopeat, fix the water seepage, make your own compost. IP Extension resident Raj Krishna Srivastava, 80, personifies the patience and passion that gardening requires. He started his terrace garden almost 32 years ago. From just a handful of seasonal flowers then to growing bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, brinjal and lining the space with larkspur, carnation, sweet William and other colourful flowers has been a cheery change, the result of devoting around three hours a day watering, weeding, pruning and arranging the plants. The growing desire to add these natural and live adornments to their home has also resulted in demand for good gardeners. Sushil Kumar, who retired as MCD gardener just before lockdown last year, hadn’t imagined he would find regular work so easily and so quickly after superannuation. He now visits homes to advise people on what plants should be planted for which season, what seeds are best, how much weight to risk on the roof, what fertilisers are best and what crops are realistic. The rush to the nurseries is also marked. An attendant at Masjid Nursery on Pandara Road explained that earlier visitors were usually people with farmhouses or big residential gardens. Today, the requests for plants for apartment terraces and balconies are growing by the day, he stated. Gupta agreed that acquiring a plant from a nursery and hiring a good gardener was a good way to get started. She added that with ample knowledge available online, setting up a home garden wasn’t too difficult. She usually hosts her friends on her terrace and gives them gourds, cauliflower or ladyfinger growing there as return gifts and to inspire them to take to gardening too. And while her garden already sports a vibrant spring look, she has added jasmine, lilies and rose for the summer to ensure the colour and fragrance linger on even after the vernal exuberance.

---||Trichy||Candidate faces criticism on IBT||Trichy: With assembly elections just weeks away, the long-pending integrated bus terminus (IBT) project for Trichy has once again gained momentum with the AIADMK making it a poll plank. The recent assurance by the party’s Thiruverumbur candidate and ex-MP P Kumar to establish an IBT at Navalpattu has caused backlash with people questioning the location and dormancy of the ruling party in executing it while in power. Kumar, while campaigning in Mela Kalkandarkottaihad said people should give him a chance to set up the IBT. However, this was not received well as locals took to social media criticising it as a political stunt. “Politicians will speak about IBT only during elections. Navalpattu is a bad choice, as it is closer to Pudukottai than Trichy,” C Balasubramanian, a senior citizen from Selvanagar said. “What stopped him from implementing the proposal when he was Trichy’s MP for 10 years? They should understand our demands instead of making us the laughing stock,” H Ghouse Baig, secretary, consumer protection council Ponmalai branch said. Residents said those from Thillai Nagar, Srirangam and Vayalur road will face trouble if the IBT is established in Navalpattu and urged the parties to set aside the political rivalry and select a proper location to benefit all. Panjappur within the city limits was suggested as an appropriate site to develop the IBT. However, as it was suggested by the DMK, residents claimed that the AIADMK is rejecting the proposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/candidate-faces-criticism-on-ibt/articleshow/81538639.cms||Deepak Karthik

In the first batch, 10 guest workers had appeared for the Class X and XII board exams in the national open school system in October last year. When the results were announced on Monday, all the 10 came out in flying colours. KPR Mills has 2,700 guest workers. Initially, the education programme was offered only to the workers who could study in English or Tamil medium. They used to appear for the Tamil Nadu matriculation and state board exams. As it turned out to be a huge hit, the firm in 2019 decided to extend the programme to the guest workers. The firm subsequently tied up with the National Institute of Open Schooling. KPR Mills also roped in teachers from Odisha, the home state of most of its guest workers, to teach them in Hindi and Oriya, their mediums of education.While Class X students opted for business studies, social science, home science, data entry operator and language, Class X students chose language, history, political science, geography and data entry operator. Eight of them selected Hindi medium and the remaining, Oriya medium.Encouraged by the results, 270 guest workers have now given names for the study programme to appear for the exams next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/more-guest-workers-enrol-for-kpr-mills-edu-programme/articleshow/81538629.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||After balm, the bait: UP traders to get interest waiver on loan||LUCKNOW: After offering a major relief to traders by withdrawing over 2.5 lakh cases registered against them under the Pandemic Act during the lockdown, the state government on Tuesday announced an interest waiver scheme for the trading community. The two major decisions are being perceived as the BJP government’s bid to consolidate the party’s popularity in the trading community as the assembly elections are to be held within a year. Talking to reporters here on Tuesday, finance minister Suresh Khanna said that the new scheme, effective from March 3 to June 6, has a provision of complete waiver of interest for traders on loans up to Rs 10 lakh, while on loans from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 1 crore they would get 90% waiver and 50% interest waiver on loans between Rs 1 crore and Rs 5 crore. For loans above Rs 5 crore, 10% interest waiver would be offered, the minister added. Khanna said that the interest waiver scheme had also been implemented last year and the state posted a recovery of Rs 113.13 crore from 14,067 defaulting traders. The scheme would give much-needed relief to traders and also ensure more revenue in the government kitty, he added.  Outbreak of novel coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdowns led to the economic slowdown last year and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath felt the need for provide a balm to the trading community, explained the finance minister. In reply to a question on spiralling prices of petroleum products in the state, Khanna said that the decision to bring petroleum products mainly petrol and diesel within the ambit of GST would be taken only by the CM. He, however, rebutted the charge that UP is levying maximum tax on petroleum products.  He said that despite the rise in international prices of crude oil, prices of petroleum products in UP are much lower than what are being charged in Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and West Bengal. Hitting out at the Congress, he said that before levelling allegations against the BJP government the Congress should see the tax rates charged by its own governments in different states. “In UP, the CM is sensitive to people’s problems and that is the reason why the tax rate here is the lowest in comparison to many other states,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-balm-the-bait-traders-to-get-interest-waiver-on-loan/articleshow/81539942.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll set for April 17, another slugfest on the cards||HYDERABAD: Another face-off between the ruling TRS and BJP is on the cards as the Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced that the byelection to Nagarjuna Sagar assembly constituency will be held on April 17. The election was necessitated due to the demise of Nagarjuna Sagar MLA Nomula Narsimhaiah in December last year. The notification will be issued on March 23 and the nomination process will begin on the same day. The last day for nominations is March 30 and counting of votes will be held on May 2. The election is crucial for all three parties — TRS, BJP and Congress. All the parties began preparations for the election two months ago. TRS, which had suffered a major setback in Dubbak byelection in November after losing to BJP, is hoping to bounce back. The BJP intends to keep the momentum going and is scouting for a candidate to take the challenge to the pink party. The Congress, which has suffered a series of defeats in elections, on Tuesday fielded senior leader and local strongman K Jana Reddy. The former minister has won seven times from this constituency. He lost in the previous elections in 2018 by just 7,700 votes to TRS. TRS supremo and CM K Chandrasekhar Rao even held a public meeting in the constituency a month ago and announced about Rs 2,700 crore sops for the erstwhile Nalgonda district (the constituency falls under this district). Of this Rs 2,500 crore would be spent on irrigation projects which would be completed in the next one and half years. He also announced Rs 186 crore for various developmental work in the municipalities and other civic bodies. Sources said the pink party is considering MLC Tera Chinnapa Reddy and Nomula Bharat, who is son of Nomula Narsimhaiah, and also other local leaders. Though parties generally field family members of the deceased MLA in byelections, this time TRS is reportedly not keen on family members in view of the experience in Dubbak byelection where Sujatha, wife of Solipeta Ramalinga Reddy, lost to BJP. The BJP, buoyed with the success in Dubbak, wants to make an impact. The saffron party had got just 2,675 votes in 2018 elections, but now it is hoping that anti-incumbency votes would work in its favour. BJP’s last contestant Kankanala Niveditha Reddy, NRI Babu Rao and Kadari Anjaiah Yadav are among those eyeing the seat. Some are even suggesting Vijayashanti’s name. But she is reportedly more keen on national politics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nsagar-bypoll-set-for-april-17-another-slugfest-on-the-cards/articleshow/81539945.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Mediation helps settle builder-buyer disputes||MUMBAI: Since 2018, over 75% of the disputes between builders and flat buyers in the state that went in for mediation were resolved successfully, thereby avoiding time-consuming litigation before Rera courts. Three years ago, Maharashtra became the first state to set up a conciliation committee under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (Rera) to settle disputes amicably. According to data collated by Mumbai-based consumer group Mumbai Grahak Panchayat (MGP), the success rate was 71% in Mumbai region and as high as 85% in Pune. Currently, there are 26 conciliation benches under Rera that help stop quarrels from going to Rera courts. It is entirely voluntary, and the conciliation can only be initiated when the complainant and builder both willingly agree to it. These conciliation benches started functioning on March 10, 2018, and on its third anniversary on Wednesday, activists said this alternate dispute redressal has done a splendid job. “On the very first day in the first sitting, Mumbai conciliation benches settled six out of 16 disputes referred to them and Pune benches settled two out of six disputes,’’ said Shirish Deshpande, chairman of MGP. “Although the pandemic prevented physical hearings by conciliation benches, they swiftly moved over to online conciliation to give relief to aggrieved home buyers,’’ said Ajoy Mehta, chairman of MahaRera. Each bench comprises one conciliator from the MGP and one conciliator from builders’ associations such as Naredco, Credai-MCHI. MGP conciliator Archana Sabnis recounts a case of a complainant residing in the UK who booked a flat by making payment of Rs 4.5 crore. “The promoter had promised to give possession by December 2017. The consumer wanted to visit the site to see the progress of the project, which was refused by the developer. The consumer came to know that the construction of his tower had not even started. Ultimately, he asked for the refund, which was flatly denied by the builder,’’ she said. The consumer filed a case before the Rera. Sensing a chance to resolve the dispute, the case was referred for conciliation. “We had a virtual conciliation, during which the consumer requested for a refund. He informed us that he was diagnosed with a grave health condition, with a low survival rate, hence, it would have been difficult for him to make any further payments towards the flat. He wanted a refund which he could utilise towards his medical expenses. The promoter flatly refused to give any refund. On the contrary, he demanded some amount from the consumer towards damages,’’ said Sabnis. “Considering the body language and attitude of both the parties, it was a real challenge for us to solve the case amicably. We were stunned with the attitude of the developer. It was a tricky and challenging situation because both the parties were facing genuine financial problems. However, considering the medical condition of the consumer, we both personally requested the developer to consider the case on humanitarian ground. Ultimately, we could bring them to a settlement,’’ she added. The developer finally offered three smaller flats instead of the bigger one that the consumer had booked to cover the payment already advanced to him. The offer was willingly accepted by the consumer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mediation-helps-settle-builder-buyer-disputes/articleshow/81540768.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

While the civil work for a new culvert across the road is under way, a portion of the road falling under the worksite area had caved in. The highways department had initiated work before the model code of conduct was imposed, by establishing a retaining wall for a length of 90m along the Cauvery river. The 14m wide road will be 23m after the construction of this project is complete. “We are utilising only the state highways land for constructing the retaining wall without disturbing the water flow in Cauvery. It will prevent erosion in the bank and road,” a senior official with the highways department said. Simultaneously, a culvert across the road will be established to drain the rainwater accumulated on the banks into the river. The construction will be completed in a couple of months by blocking a portion of the road in a phased manner. “We cannot insist the PWD reduce the water flow as there is a demand among people during ongoing summer,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/water-flow-hinders-road-construction/articleshow/81538657.cms||---

He announced this decision in Delhi along with the NCP supremo Sharad Pawar. Later talking to TOI, Chacko said he decided to join NCP as he felt that Pawar can make significant contributions in uniting forces opposing BJP. “Such an initiative is not coming from Congress that has become sterile due to internal issues. Rahul Gandhi should have taken up an initiative to call all parties, including regional ones and rallied them against BJP. Nothing of that sort happened,” he said. Chacko said Congress seems to be facing an identity crisis. There are drastic changes in political conditions with rise of a political party with fascist tendencies. There are no serious discussions in Congress about strategies that need to be adopted to confront these realities. I have attended over 10 working committees where discussions are limited to routine affairs and not long-terms strategies, Chacko said. “In Congress, everything is functioning in an ad hoc manner, we have an ad hoc president, we have an ad hoc working committee, and ad hoc office. If the Congress is not working systematically then who will fill the vacuum? Pawar is the senior-most leader who can unite all non-BJP parties. Of course, Congress is an important party and it should be there. We are not saying that non-Congress parties can take on BJP. Pawar has excellent links with all regional parties in India. He has good relations with (Jagan Mohan) Reddy in Andhra Pradesh. He is going to West Bengal to campaign for Mamata Banerjee tomorrow,” he added. Pawar clarified there was no fundamental contradiction in NCP’s alliance with Left in Kerala, Congress in Maharashtra and TMC in West Bengal as the objective was to take on BJP in the most-effective way. Pawar spoke to CM Pinarayi Vijayan who welcomed Chacko into NCP. Chacko said he will reach Kerala on Thursday and start campaigning for LDF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chacko-joins-ncp-to-campaign-for-ldf/articleshow/81538648.cms||T Ramavarman

Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of the hospital, said this has been done to ensure the infection doesn’t spread. “This is the first case due to the South Africa variant in the city. We are taking extreme precaution to prevent the spread of the infection and also avoid mixing of this patient with others suffering from Covid-19,” he added. Hospital sources said the 33-year-old from Kerala is asymptomatic. “He was transferred to Lok Nayak from the airport on his return from South Africa about 10 days ago after he tested positive,” said an official. Multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, are circulating globally. The most significant among them is the UK variant, which was reported first from the UK, apart from the South Africa and the Brazil variant. Gradually, these variants spread to other countries. According to the Centre for Disease Control, US, in January 2021, scientists from the UK reported evidence that suggested B.1.1.7 – the variant which originated there — may be associated with an increased risk of death compared with other variants. About the South Africa variant, the US health body suggested, this shared some mutations with B.1.1.7. (the UK variant). “In Brazil, a variant of SARS-CoV-2 (P.1) emerged, which was first identified in four travelers, who were tested during routine screening at Haneda airport outside Tokyo. This variant has 17 unique mutations, including three in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein,” the CDC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/isolation-ward-for-man-with-sa-strain/articleshow/81538650.cms||---
---||Nagpur||NMC transport dept collected only 25% of projected revenue in ’20-21||Nagpur: The Covid pandemic has severely dented the NMC transport committee’s projected revenue for 2020-21 as it has collected only Rs77.3 crore which is about 25% of the projected target of Rs 304 crore. The NMC’s transport manager and deputy municipal commissioner Ravindra Bhelave presented the revised transport department budget for 2020-21 and projection for 2021-22 to transport committee chairman Narendra Borkar on Tuesday. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, the NMC completely shut the city bus operation from March 23, 2020 to October 27, 2020. The bus services were resumed in a phased manner, subsequently. Though it has curtailed its losses, the civic body will provide Rs 70 crore as viability gap fund against an expenditure of Rs 76.86 crore in the current fiscal. Income from ticket was only Rs 7 crore in the current year. The transport manager has projected Rs 246.04 crore for the next financial year 2021-22, while the NMC will spend Rs 245.87 crore for operating Aapli Bus service in the city. Against a total strength of 400 and with educational institutions staying shut, the NMC is operating 252 buses in the city including 153 standard buses, 73 midi, 21 mini and five Tejaswani buses. Approximately 50,000 people avail the Aapli Bus services daily. Apart from serving the public at large, the NMC has also deployed 60 mini buses for Covid-19 duty since the outbreak of the pandemic. Lack of funds in the NMC has also affected the vision of Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari that his hometown should have environmental-friendly public transport. Against a target of converting 237 diesel-run standard buses to CNG, the NMC could convert only 55. Besides, the civic body has also failed to avail the central government subsidy to purchase 100 electric buses. However, the cash-starved NMC has expressed willingness to purchase only 40 midi electric buses. For this, Rs18 crore grant will be received from the central government at the rate of Rs 45 lakh per bus. The NMC has received 20% of this amount of Rs 3.60 crore. The central government had sanctioned Rs 45 lakh per bus for the purchase of 100 electric buses but Bhelave in his budget speech admitted that the NMC will not be able to procure 100 electric midi buses due to its precarious financial situation. Now, the transport committee chairman will modify the proposed budget and will submit it to the standing committee for final approval. Box * Rs 18 crore central government grant for 40 electric midi buses * 3.70 acres out of 8.75 acres at Khapri Depot for 40 midi electric buses * Provision of Rs 3.55 crore for roads inside depots * Provision of Rs 10 crore for construction of Bus Depot at Wathoda * Rs 75 lakh for erecting bus stop display * Rs 5 crore provision for strengthening bus depots and facilities there||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-transport-dept-collected-only-25-of-projected-revenue-in-20-21/articleshow/81536344.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The 58-year-old resident of Cheran Managar, which falls under Kavundampalayam constituency, has chosen Singanallur as his battleground because of the presence of about 1.5 lakh micro, small and medium enterprises in the assembly constituency. Singanallur is home to several foundries, pump set makers and grinder players. “I am contesting on behalf of the industrialists. I am entering the poll fray as I want to voice their concerns directly in the assembly. None of the politicians has spoken for us before,” Maniraj said. Pointing out that the industries had undergone a lot of struggle during the lockdown, he said the state government was not even ready to waive off electricity bills or allow them to pay the same in instalments for the months they didn’t function. “Apart from providing additional loan with interest, the Union government has not helped us in any way. We had made several representations for a helping hand, but in vain. But all the political parties are willing to offer freebies to grab power. Apart from issuing statements, none of the political parties had stood by us during difficult times,” he said. Maniraj said he was contesting as an independent as he didn’t want to be named as a party man and address the party’s issues. “I had received offers from several political parties. I am confident of winning the election, as I have the support of my peers and the public, who are disappointed with the political parties.” He said it was Kovai Power Driven Pumps and Spares’ Manufacturers Association members who helped with the nomination fees of Rs 10,000. He is the president of the association. He filed the nomination papers at the east zone corporation office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/industrialist-enters-fray-as-independent/articleshow/81538647.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||BMC asked to fast-track open spaces policy month after budget promised it||MUMBAI: In his February budget speech, municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal had announced a new open spaces policy will be rolled out. More than a month later, the wait continues. Meanwhile, NAGAR, an NGO that works on open spaces issues, has written to Chahal expressing dismay over the 50% cut in the budget for parks and gardens in the city. The NGO has demanded that BMC come out with a robust open spaces policy to reduce the financial burden on the civic body. “The financial burden on BMC will be lessened a fair amount by formulating a robust open spaces policy with watertight guidelines, including checks and balances recommended by NAGAR to the garden department in August 2019. Many stakeholders and NGOs are keen to assume responsibility, both financial via CSR and restoration and maintenance, of these open spaces provided there is a fair policy with at least a three year contract reviewed every year and renewable on good performance,” NAGAR trustee Nayana Kathpalia said in the letter to Chahal. Times ViewPublic parks and gardens are vital for citizens in a space-starved city. The need for well-maintained, easily accessible open spaces has become even more acute after the pandemic. Even after an announcement by the civic chief in the BMC budget, the city remains without a policy for managing open spaces for four years. BMC must come up with it after consultations with all stakeholders soon.BMC’s old open spaces policy was scrapped in 2016 and a new one is yet to be cleared for managing the city’s parks and gardens. NGOs and citizen groups have asked the civic body to fast-track the new policy. In August 2019, BMC had sought suggestions and objections from citizens for the new draft policy on open spaces. This year, BMC has more than halved its budget provision for constructing parks and gardens compared with the previous year. As against around Rs 254 crore allocated as part of the capital expenditure for the garden’s department last year, BMC has kept only Rs 126 crore aside this year. “With just Rs 126 crore, beautification and development of existing gardens and parks will come to a standstill. In addition, this would take away any possibility of new gardens or parks being developed. It is our earnest request to you to expedite and release the policy for public open spaces,” the NGO added in the letter. “There is a need for maximum open spaces and gardens in the city which will provide a healthy and pollution-free environment to the citizens. As such, the BMC is planning to frame a comprehensive policy for development and maintenance of gardens and open spaces,” Chahal had said in the budget.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-asked-to-fast-track-open-spaces-policy-month-after-budget-promised-it-in-mumbai/articleshow/81538885.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The convention passed a resolution demanding a change in candidate and selected a 15-member committee for further talks. “The meeting asked high command to reconsider candidate selection at Irikkur as it was taken without considering the sentiments of party workers. There is a chance of losing Irikkur, a sure seat of UDF. So, this meeting demands that high command must take note of the emotions of party workers and reconsiders its decision,” stated the resolution. After the convention, Sebastian said that candidates were changed after selections in the past in Kannur. “Workers are agitated because a candidate with lesser chances was chosen. Our aim is to bring UDF in power. if candidate declared by high command comes, it will result in a failure at Kannur and Peravoor. This will affect UDF’s prospects. Under these circumstance, we demand the candidature of Sony Sebastian, who is acceptable to everyone,” said Devasya Palappuram, Congress Alakode block committee president. Earlier, KPCC representative MM Hassan and KC Joseph, the MLA from Irikkur, had met leaders in Irikkur. Though there were reports that the DCC president post was offered to A-group to pacify them, the same was not confirmed by senior leaders. After the meeting Hassan said the workers were adamant on their decision. “When we tried to make them understand about the candidate’s winning prospects, they told us in detail why it would end in failure. We asked them to obey high command’s decision. They refused and told that they were calling a convention to apprise the workers about these developments,” said Hassan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/stalemate-at-irikkur-continues-as-talks-hit-a-wall/articleshow/81538706.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Kamal hits streets like a commoner||Coimbatre/Salem: It took a second glimpse – third for many – to realize that the man who was walking past them in a brisk manner in navy blue jogging suit wearing a black face mask was Kamal Haasan. The matinee idol turned politician thought it fit to get out of the gym of the star hotel where he was staying and join the joggers and walkers in Race Course in the city on Tuesday. Clearly, the men and women who had come to Race Course hoping for another routine day went back with a pleasant surprise. Kamal had hit the Race Course road as early as 6am leaving them in disbelief. Race Course falls in Coimbatore South segment, where Kamal is contesting. As they came closer, Kamal exchanged pleasantries, shook hands with some and interacted with a few. He then went to Ramanathapuram where he sought to know the problems faced by the residents from the public there. The actor then went straight to Sandow Chinnappa Thevar gym in Olympus. The gym, founded by yesteryear film producer Chinnapa Thevar, is one of the oldest in the city. According to Kollywood lore, it was in this gym that film star and former chief minister MGR learnt martial arts for movies like ‘Abhimanyu’ when several films were shot in Central Studio and Pakshiraja Studio in Coimbatore. Kamal demonstrated his silambaattam, deftly swinging and swaying silambam - the long cane, much to the delight of the students and masters alike at the gym. The MNM chief then visited the fish market at Ukkadam, interacted with the traders there and inspected ongoing Ukkadam flyover works before hopping on to an auto to return to his hotel in Race Course. Back at the hotel, he met members of Coimbatore Jewellery Manufacturers Association led by its president B Muthuvenkatraman, who form a sizable vote bank in the constituency. They submitted a memorandum about the woes faced by the jewellery units. In the evening, Kamal took a special flight to Salem where he addressed a public meeting at Dadagapatty. Calling AIADMK a headless snake and the DMK as a dangerous animal, Kamal wanted people to vanquish both. Harping on to the legacy of MGR, Kamal said that when the late matinee idol entered politics, he was also termed as a third front. But he went on to win the elections and create history.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/kamal-hits-streets-like-a-commoner/articleshow/81538705.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||KSEB liable to provide power: HC||KOCHI: KSEB is liable to provide electricity connection within one month of receiving application as electricity is an integral part of right to life, said the high court. Upholding the order of State Electricity Regulatory Commission imposing a fine of Rs 75,000 on two KSEB officials for failing to provide connection within the stipulated time, Justice Murali Pursuhothaman said it is the statutory duty of KSEB to provide connection within one month as stipulated under Section 43 of the Electricity Act. In the judgment, the court said, “Electricity is a basic amenity in life. Water and electricity are integral part of right to life within the meaning of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Section 43 of the Electricity Act provides that there is a statutory duty on the distribution licensee to provide electric connection to the applicants within one month after receipt of the application requiring such supply. The 1st respondent Board (KSEB) is the sole distribution licensee for electricity within the State and therefore the Board and its officials shall make every endeavor to provide electricity supply to applicants without any delay.” When KSEB declined to grant a new connection to the 300-square feet house of P Sainuddeen of Malappuram in May 2013 citing lack of minimum distance from the house to low-tension line, he approached the consumer grievance redressal forum (CGRF). The forum ordered for providing connection after shifting the line as per the plan presented by KSEB officials. When the order was not complied with, Sainudeen approached the regulatory commission. When the commission sought a report, KSEB, for the first time, contended that a stay wire has to be installed in an adjacent property and consent of the property owner is required. The regulatory commission held that the KSEB officials were well aware of the need for plating a stay wire in the adjacent property when they submitted the plan for shifting the line before the CGRF but it was hidden before the forum. Easier alternatives such as providing a strut instead of a stay or providing underground cable or aerial bunched conductor, etc were not considered by KSEB, the regulatory commission said. Despite specific direction, the KSEB officials failed to produce the file before it, the regulatory commission pointed out. For wilful non-compliance of the CGRF’s order, the regulatory commission ordered KN Raveendranadhan, assistant executive engineer of Kottackal sub division, to pay a penalty of Rs 50,000 and K Keeran, assistant engineer of Edarikode electrical section to pay Rs 25,000. The high court held that it finds no reason to interfere with the orders of CGRF and the regulatory commission. The court was told that Sainuddeen has been provided an electricity connection during the pendency of the writ petition. In the judgment, the high court said, “To light up a tiny bulb in his tiny house, Sainuddeen had to walk from pole to pole.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kseb-liable-to-provide-power-hc/articleshow/81537444.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 19-year-old with sex organs of both genders operated||MUMBAI: Doctors at JJ Hospital Byculla have successfully operated on a 19-year-old individual who had both the male and female reproductive organs. An extremely rare case of hermaphroditism, the doctors surgically removed the female parts as the individual said he was raised like a man and desired to continue with the gender. The teenager came to the state-run hospital about a month ago with complaints of abdomen pain. The family said they had visited many doctors, but none could explain or treat the pain. On running some tests, including endoscopy and CT scan, they found a swelling in the left side of the abdomen. The doctors then discovered that his left scrotal sac was empty with missing left testicles, but the right testicles were normal. Suspecting it to be a case of disorder of sex development, they carried out an MRI and found he also had an ovary, fallopian tube, uterus and vagina on the left side. Cases of true hermaphroditism are extremely rare, said Dr Venkat Gite, head of urology, adding that such a genetic disorder is found in between one in 20,000 or one in 40,000 births. “The boy had female reproductive organs on the left side and male on the right,” he said. Dr Gite said he was menstruating like a regular woman of reproductive age for the last 2-3 years. “Since the vagina was blocked and there was no outlet for the menstrual blood, it was clotted around the ovaries, which was causing the pain,” Dr Gite said. The hospital then carried out a chromosomal study as well as a psychiatric evaluation to understand which gender he associated himself with. “The patient had 46 XX chromosome, which is a characteristic feature of a female, but he also had parts of Y chromosome,” said the doctor. After counselling, the doctors performed the surgery where they removed all his female organs and nearly a litre of clotted menstrual blood. Dr Gite said he can start a family too but through assisted reproductive technology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/19-yr-old-with-sex-organs-of-both-genders-operated-in-mumbai/articleshow/81538896.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Rs 800 crore Punjab RDF withheld over misuse: Union minister||CHANDIGARH: Since Punjab has complained, the Centre apprised the Lok Sabha on Tuesday that it had to withhold the state’s 2% rural development fund (RDF) of Rs 800 crore over diversion to “purposes not in line fully with the revised principles of February 24 last year”. Replying in Parliament to Punjab Congress MPs Gurjeet Singh Aujla and Ravneet Singh Bittu, Union minister of state for food and public distribution Raosaheb Danve has said that under the revised principles, only the statutory charges gone into improving the infrastructure of the crop procurement centres can be claimed as financial assistance, while the state notified under the Punjab Rural Development Act, 1987, that the RDF can be used for the dispensaries, sanitation, and rural roads as well. On February 24, 2020, the department of food and public distribution (DFPD) had revised the governing principles of incidental and other statutory charges on the recommendations of a sub-committee of principal secretaries of major procuring states, including Punjab. The minister said that, therefore, Punjab had been asked to declare the portion of RDF being used for improving the procurement centres. “Until they give that information, the DFPD has released 1% of minimum support price (MSP) to the state government as RDF for the Kharif marketing season 2O2O-21, as an interim measure,” he added. The Centre has requested all states concerned, including Puniab, to furnish certain inputs relating to statutory charges, except the mandi fee, to finalise the RDF matter. The minister said the Centre had released the admissible provisional or advance food subsidy to states such as Punjab under the decentralised procurement scheme based on its quarter-wise claims. He said the states’ food subsidy claims were processed based on the opening and closing balance of stock, procurement, allocation and distribution of food grains, Food Corporation of India (FCI) reconciliation, utilisation certificate, and the economic cost of food grains among other factors. For the release of subsidy, the DFPD also issues a provisional cost for every state, and it contains the MSP and various other incidentals such as statutory charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rs-800cr-punjab-rdf-withheld-over-misuse-union-minister/articleshow/81538707.cms||Sanjeev Verma

The SAD also castigated the Punjab legislative assembly speaker for surrendering the area in the possession of Punjab in the assembly complex to Haryana. SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said it was condemnable that sections like 323, which indicated SAD legislators had resorted to violence and caused hurt during their “peaceful demonstration” against Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, were thrust against the legislative party members. He said the video of the entire protest was a matter of record. “SAD legislators protested in the area used by Punjab legislators. They never entered the Haryana vidhan sabha precincts,” he claimed. As far as the complaint of the Haryana vidhan sabha speaker that the SAD MLAs had stopped the way of the Haryana chief minister and showed him black flags was concerned, Cheema asked if it is a crime to show black flags in a peaceful protest in a democracy. The SAD spokesperson said Akali legislators had held a symbolic protest to highlight the “atrocities inflicted on farmers as well as human rights activists by the Haryana government”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fir-against-akali-mlas-smacks-of-emergency/articleshow/81538712.cms||---

The woman probably contracted the disease in the city, since neither she nor anyone in her family has travel history to any foreign country.The report dated March 16 of National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, said the woman was infected by the B.1.1.7 variant. She is the only one among 17 cases of Wardha district to be detected with this variant as per the NIV report.Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde told TOI, “B.1.1.7 variant is titled as Variant of Concern (VOC) and considered the major reason behind second wave and high number of cases in Europe. Transmissibility has increased 50% with this variant in Europe.”This mutated variant also shares 50% credit for the spike in cases in the US. Case studies have revealed this variant is highly contagious and fatality rate is low. “Biggest worry for us will be that it is not yet clear whether antibodies developed from Covishield and Covaxin vaccines will be able to fight this variant,” he said.Dr Shinde added, “It is very clear that this variant has spread in community if the woman and her family members have no travel history.”With spike in cases in many districts of Vidarbha, large number of swab samples of positive patients were sent to National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The district, especially city, is witnessing highest growth in cases in the state since second week of February. Results of 74 samples sent from the district are awaited.A homemaker, the woman told TOI, “My in-laws reside in the city. My brother-in-law was the first to test positive in my family on February 22. Later, eight members from our family tested positive including me. My bother-in-law had no comorbidities. He died while undergoing treatment in a private hospital in the city on March 8.”The woman gave her sample at district general hospital, Wardha, on February 24 and her results came positive on February 25. The NIV received her swab sample on March 3 from Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College run by Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha.The woman added, “I reside with my two sons at Wardha and my husband works in Bhandara district. A relative got married in Wardha on February 15. Then, we came to Nagpur to attend ‘haldi’ ceremony of a relative on February 17. I had severe symptoms like fever, body ache, loose motion etc. I got admitted in IGGMCH on February 28 and was discharged on March 6. I have tested negative in repeat test after discharge.”The woman said, “No one from our family member has ever visited any foreign country, or even other states in recent past. We also inquired with family which organized ‘haldi’ ceremony and none of them had symptoms or got tested.”The woman was not aware about her swab samples testing positive in genome sequencing for UK variant when TOI contacted her. “I did not receive any call from anyone. How is it possible that my swab sample was detected with UK variant when none of us travelled anywhere,” she asked.Eight residents of the city who returned from UK between November 25 and December 23 had tested positive in RT-PCR tests. One of them tested negative for the UK variant and genome sequencing on others was not done for various reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wardha-woman-who-attended-family-prog-in-city-has-uk-variant/articleshow/81563998.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

It was tabled in the assembly on Monday. The kisan morcha claimed that according to the law the “voice of the people will be suppressed by trapping the agitators in various cases”. “This effort is being made to suppress the ongoing farmer movement and involve farmers in cases,” SKM said. Terming the bill as a fiasco of the Haryana government, the morcha said a resolution was passed against the farmers in Haryana legislative assembly after farmers gave a call for boycott of JJP and BJP MLAs. “This is the result of the pressure created by the farmers of Haryana on the JJP and BJP MLAs,” it said in a statement on Tuesday. The morcha said it had been more than three months since the movement was started on Delhi borders. “Beyond political differences, the government is also not showing basic humanity. Nearly 300 farmers have died in this movement. The government should break its arrogant attitude and provide all possible help to the farmers who died or got injured. The morcha has always been in favour of dialogue. “The government should remove obstacles and open the way for dialogue. The farmers have already rejected the old proposal given by the government,” it said. In order to strengthen the movement, a joint session of trade unions, transport unions and other rights organisations will be held on Wednesday to chalk out further strategy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-front-slams-bill-on-property-damage-recovery/articleshow/81538732.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Ambani security scare: NIA searches crime intel unit, seizes CPU, iPad and documents||MUMBAI: The NIA on Tuesday night seized a Mercedes car being used by Sachin Waze. The Mercedes is registered in the name of one Manisha Bhavsar. Waze used it to commute to the police commissioner’s office, where he was posted. NIA officials on Monday night carried out a search of the Crime Intelligence Unit in the police headquarters and seized a CPU, Waze’s i-pad and some documents. Sources said there are no records of the seizure of the digital video recorder taken out of Waze’s housing society on February 27 by API Riyazuddin Kazi. The recorder contained images of the Scorpio being parked there. NIA officials suspect the image of a man in a PPE kit getting down from the Innova and walking towards the explosives-laden vehicle is of Waze. Sources said Waze has not admitted to his role in Hiran’s murder and more people are likely to be involved. “Specific inputs gathered by NIA had revealed the involvement of accused Sachin Waze, working as an assistant police inspector, crime branch, in the conspiracy leading to placing the explosives-laden SUV on Carmichael Road on February 25,” the NIA’s remand plea said. The investigating agency said it had seized the vehicle on Sunday. Earlier this week, Waze was remanded in NIA custody till March 25 in connection with the probe into recovery of explosives from the SUV found parked outside Antilia on February 25. The remand plea said that after Waze was questioned on Saturday, his “direct involvement in planting of the explosives-laden SUV… on the intervening night of February 24 and 25 had emerged”. “There is sufficient prima facie evidence to show the involvement of the accused in the conspiracy of a commission of the crime,” the remand plea said. The NIA’s remand plea said the three offences, Mansukh Hiran’s murder, planting of explosives and vehicle theft were evidently connected. The NIA also said a threat letter was posted on Telegram by terror outfit Jaish-Ul-Hind and a ransom demand was made claiming responsibility for the incident. It said the person lodged in Tihar jail who allegedly sent the message was taken into custody by the Delhi special cell along with the mobile instrument used. The NIA said Waze’s custody was required to check the evidence. It also said Waze’s criminal antecedents need to be brought on record to bring clarity regarding the conspiracy and probable links, if any. NIA alleged the cases were being handled by four investigating officers till now, and Waze was the second. “There are discrepancies in handing over taking memos which need to be clarified from the accused,” the NIA said. Calling the offences grave, NIA said the conspiracy angle needs to be thoroughly investigated and identity of co-conspirators needs to be established .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbainia-searches-crime-intel-unit-seizes-cpu-ipad-and-docus/articleshow/81538760.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Plight of fishing community ignored||Kochi: The last five years have not been easy for the coastal communities living in 59 constituencies in the state, especially those in the fishing sector. These people, numbering to around 10 lakh, belong to Hindu Dheevara, Latin Catholic and Muslim communities. Among them, around 7.5 lakh people live along the coast and the remaining reside in inland areas. They have been bearing the brunt of sea erosion and extreme weather events but their demand to the government to set its sights beyond subsidies have gone unheeded, they say. “Neither the state nor the Centre has done much for the community’s overall development. On paper, there’s talk of harbour development and modernization. Politicians play caste and religious politics with us and leave us divided during elections,” said Antony Kurusunkal of the Kerala Swatantra Matsyathozhilali Union. “Fish drought, weather events leading to ban on fishing across the coasts followed by Covid and the economic slowdown, the rising kerosene and diesel costs have all affected our lives,” said Charles George a member of the fisheries protection council that launched protests against the state government’s deal with EMCC International for deep-sea fishing.Fishermen say both the central and state governments have been playing politics. “The kerosene subsidy was reduced to 25 litres per month from 128 litres for the past four years. Now, just last month, they have increased it again. It doesn’t even last a month for the outboard engines in traditional boats. We still need to buy from the open market. None of the MLAs listen to us over our concerns about diesel prices, licence and registration fees, etc,” said Kurusunkal. The Dheevara community has been seeking representatives from the coastal regions to represent them. “The minority communities (both Latin and Muslims) have their representatives, but often these are people who have no connection with the community and its problems. They are picked just because they represent their religions. Since we are split across the south, central and north zones, we are not a unified political force. Even the campaigning by candidates are not on local issues that have an impact on us,” said Praveen V, chairman, Dheevara Trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/plight-of-fishing-community-ignored/articleshow/81538737.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

During the hearing on petitions filed by chief whip K Rajan and Congress’ local leader and advocate Shaji J Kodankandath seeking urgent opening of one of the tunnels to ease traffic congestion, NHAI’s counsel submitted that some tests have to be conducted before opening one of the tunnels. The court has now sought a report on this. A counsel representing Rajan submitted that traffic accidents increased since the construction on the tunnels started. In the last 11 years, 119 persons died and 752 persons suffered injuries whereas the number of traffic accidents stood at 659, the counsel said relying on an RTI reply from police. NHAI’s counsel submitted that the increase in accidents is due to careless driving and not due to construction activities. Thrissur Expressway Ltd, which is the contractor, had informed the court last month that work on the second tunnel can be finished only if traffic is diverted through the first tunnel after its completion. It was alleged in the petitions that non-completion of the tunnels has worsened the traffic congestion in the national-highway stretch. The court will hear the case again on April 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/one-of-two-kuthiran-tunnels-almost-ready-contractor-to-hc/articleshow/81537482.cms||---

The remarks drew a double-edged Twitter retort from Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra. “So Yogi CM comes to WB today, says he will kill ‘TMC goondas’ one by one. Gudduji – listen up – your thok do culture... doesn’t work here," she said. “May 2 ke baad TMC ki vidai sunishchit hai. Yeh TMC ke gunday, yeh kanoon ko nahi maante…Jab BJP ki sarkar aayegi to in goondon ko chun chun ke saza dilwayi jayegi (TMC’s departure is certain after May 2. TMC goons know no law, but when BJP comes to power, all these goons will be punished," Yogi said in Purulia. Besides Purulia, the UP CM addressed rallies in Bankura and West Medinipur districts, lacing his speeches with references to the alleged culture of "tolabaazi (extortion)" and "cut money" under TMC. Harking back to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Yogi said such was Trinamool's alleged intolerance that he was stopped from campaigning in Purulia. He had then landed in Jharkhand before driving down 35km to reach Purulia. "There is no stopping misuse of power in West Bengal even today," he said, claiming that scores of BJP supporters had been stopped from reaching the venue of his rally. Yogi claimed Bengal CM Mamata's alleged dislike for the "Jai Shri Ram" chant had translated into restricting people from using it. "Those who try to separate people from Ram get routed from power," he said, accusing the state government of playing with the sentiments of Hindus. The CM said there was already a precedent of "Ram Virodhi (anti-Ram)" governments being driven out of power in UP. Yogi said that before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, there were many people who thought that visiting temples would put secularism in danger. "But now things have changed. Even Mamata Didi is visiting temples and reciting Chandi Path (invocation to the mother goddess)," he said. "Yeh Parivartan hai na. Yeh hai naya Bharat…har vyakti ko Bhagwan ki sharan mein jaana hi padega (This is the change. This is new India. Everybody will have to be at God's feet)." On former Congress president Rahul Gandhi going on a "temple run" during elections, Yogi said opposition leaders being forced to visit shrines was no less than a "Vaicharik vijay (ideological victory)" for BJP. Hailing Bengal as a land of Sanskritik Rashtravad (cultural nationalism), Yogi said that the state had produced stalwarts like Ram Krishna Paramhansa, Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda and Subhash Chandra Bose. "The state was poised to be an axis of development at the time of Independence. Unfortunately, Congress, the communists and then TMC rendered it hollow. The prestige of the state is under threat." Yogi accused TMC of depriving people of the benefits of welfare scheme initiated by the Narendra Modi government. "This is because TMC goons do not allow the schemes to get implemented," he said. BJP's saffron mascot also accused the TMC government of allowing rampant cow slaughter. He claimed that a minister in the Mamata cabinet had been lately advocating cow slaughter. "He should have been immediately sacked. But that was not done since the TMC chief herself has been supporting such people."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/west-bengal-polls-2021-yogi-tmc-trade-barbs-on-goons-thok-do-culture/articleshow/81540971.cms||Pankaj Shah

Swamy’s defence had opposed NIA’s plea to submit additional material, stating that the bail plea was posted for orders. The special court allowed NIA’s plea. NIA then referred to some internal report of an officer from Ranchi relating to a station diary. The defence urged the court not to consider this material. It also cited Swamy’s age and said he was suffering from various ailments. The court is likely to pronounce the order on the bail plea on March 22. Earlier, NIA had opposed his bail plea and submitted that there was sufficient evidence against Swamy and that the offence was grave. It also said there was a “deep-rooted conspiracy”. Swamy was arrested on October 8. In his bail plea, Swamy denied the allegations. He had said the Persecuted Political Prisoners Solidarity Committee, which the NIA had alleged was a frontal organisation of CPI (M), was one of the most prominent human rights organisations in Jharkhand providing legal aid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/stan-swamy-bail-plea-order-likely-on-march-22/articleshow/81538763.cms||---
---||Kochi||Elephant Ernakulam Sivakumar to open south gate this year||Thrissur: The popular elephant Thechikottukavu Ramachandran will not be present this year to open the Thekke Gopura Nada of Sree Vadakkunnathan Temple as part of the Thrissur Pooram, because of its ill-health. Instead, the elephant Ernakulam Sivakumar belonging to the Cochin Devaswom Board, will open the nada this year. This decision was taken jointly by the office-bearers of Naithilakkavu Temple, and Cochin Devaswom Board. Opening of the Thekke Gopura Nada, which is supposed to be the “declaration” of the commencement of the Thrissur Pooram was a rather innocuous event held on the previous day of the Pooram, till recently. The event comprises a procession with one elephant from Naithilakkavu temple, and after entering the Vadakkunnathan temple through the west gate, the procession emerges through the South gate which will remain closed for most part of the year. The event became an exciting component of the Pooram after the elephant Ramachandran started being paraded in the procession. Even though there were restrictions in the parading of elephants because of ill-health in 2019, it was allowed to be paraded for one hour then, after intense public pressure. Hundreds of fans of Ramachandran and Pooram had assembled to watch the event then. According to official sources, the devaswoms have been asked to submit a detailed plan on the number of people who would be participating in the various events associated with the Pooram, and how to ensure compliance of the Covid protocol. They said work on organizing the Pooram, especially the Pooram exhibition, will begin soon. Interestingly, forest officials had lifted the ban on the parading of the elephant Thechikottukavu Ramachandran after examining the elephant with a fresh team of veterinarians. The assistant conservator of forests Prabhu said the decision to lift the ban was taken at the meeting of the district elephant monitoring committee held on Sunday. However, he said the elephant can be paraded only after ensuring strict compliance of various conditions fixed earlier. It is not clear why the elephant is not being allowed to take part in the ritual of opening the Thekkke Gopura Nada, even after the forest officials lifted the ban on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/elephant-ernakulam-sivakumar-to-open-south-gate-this-year/articleshow/81537488.cms||---
---||Chennai||Case of sexual harassment: HC urges Tamil Nadu to suspend DGP||CHENNAI: Disagreeing with the Tamil Nadu government’s stand that keeping a DGP, facing sexual harassment complaint from a woman IPS officer, on ‘compulsory wait’ is a punishment, the Madras high court has asked the government to take positive steps to suspend him. It is nearly a month since the IPS officer lodged a complaint of sexual harassment against the then special DGP, who has since been shunted out and kept without posting. On Tuesday, Justice Anand Venkatesh said the TN government should take positive steps by suspending the DGP and restore public confidence that the issue was being handled with all seriousness and that the investigation would progress in a free and fair manner. Refusing to accept the submission of the state that the DGP had already been kept on ‘compulsory wait’, Justice Anand Venkatesh said: “It is settled law that the period during which a government servant is kept under compulsory wait is construed to be a period spent on duty.” Noting that the sentiments expressed by the court in the present order should be given due weightage by the state, the court adjourned hearing of the suo motu plea to March 23, for the state to file a status report. “The government servant concerned will be entitled for all the service benefits, including allowances, during this period of compulsory wait. It is, therefore, clear that keeping an officer under compulsory wait can never be construed as a punishment,” the judge added. In the present case, the investigation is conducted by an officer in the rank of superintendent of police. But the prime accused is holding the rank of DGP. When such a superior officer who has been kept on a mere compulsory wait is interrogated by an officer of a subordinate rank, the same will psychologically intimidate the officer from carrying on with the interrogation in a free and fair manner, the court said.

On the completion of four years of Congress government, Chugh alleged that several mafia involved in the illicit drug, liquor, sand and land traders, were running in the state. He said Amarinder had sworn to rid the state of drugs with the Gutka Sahib in his hands but had not kept his word. “People in Punjab are dying of drugs and the Amarinder government has been able to do nothing about it,” he said. Chugh said none of the promises made in the election manifesto have been fulfilled by the Amarinder government in four years. “Unemployment is rising, farmers are in distress, government employees are on strike every other day, law and order has gone to the dogs. Is this what Amarinder Singh has given to Punjab in four years?” Chugh asked. He said the Congress government had promised to give employment to every family, adequate compensation to small farmers and facilities for students, but nothing had been done. “The Amarinder government has, in fact, cheated people of the state with false promises and non-performance in the last four years,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-made-punjab-a-mafia-state-in-4-yrs-says-bjp-gen-secy/articleshow/81538745.cms||---

These missile sections will be supplied to Rafael which in turn will supply these to defence public sector enterprise Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) for further integration. These are part of the $100 million order bagged by KRAS from Rafael of Israel for delivering over 1,000 MRSAM ‘missile kits’ to the Indian army and air force over the next few years. KRAS has also started offering MRO (maintenance & repair operations) services for in-service air defence missile systems to the Indian armed forces, its CEO Rudra Jadeja said, adding that it started out in 2019 with MRO services for LLQRM (Low Level Quick Reaction Missile), which were supplied by Rafael to Indian Air Force, and will be extended to other Rafael and KRAS systems as well in the future. According to Brig Gen Pinhas Yungman, head of air and missile defense systems division, Rafael Advanced Defense System, they are planning to bring more projects to KRAS not just for the Indian armed forces but for exports markets as well. Col Rajender Bhatia, CEO-defence, Bharat Forge Ltd, said Hyderabad is also playing a key role in R&D for the company with a technology development centre at Gachibowli that has around 40 people, including RF (radio frequency), MW (micro-wave) engineers and former DRDO scientists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pvt-firm-hands-over-missile-kits-to-rafael/articleshow/81538752.cms||---

---||Allahabad||No death related to Covid-19 in Prayagraj in past 35 days||Prayagraj: Out of the total 11.35 lakh samples collected in Sangam city, roughly 2.58 per cent of the samples tested positive for the novel coronavirus infection since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the infection rate reported in March so far has been 0.15 per cent of the samples collected in the past fortnight this month. This is a positive trend, given the recent spike in Covid-19 cases in different parts of the country in March. After analysing the records, officials of the health department on Tuesday claimed to have collected a total of 11,35,335 samples for testing and 29,394 of them tested positive for Covid-19 infection in the past one year. Statistics also revealed that the death percentage among Covid-19 positive patients in Sangam city was 1.39 per cent. Moreover, around 99.90 per cent of patients had recovered in the home isolation method. Data also claimed that 21,756 patients have recovered in home isolation while 7,189 others were discharged and recovered from Covid hospitals. A team of health officials including the chief medical officer (Prayagraj) Dr Prabhakar Rai and district surveillance officer (DSO) Dr Rahul Singh on Tuesday analysed the Covid-19 statistics and found that the percentage of people who tested positive for Covid-19 infection was merely 2.58 per cent during the corona pandemic. Dr Singh, meanwhile, told TOI that as many as 48,122 samples were collected for testing including 32,922 samples for antigen test, 13,764 for RTPCR test and 1,436 for Truenet Covid test between March 1. To date, 74 of them tested positive for Covid-19 infection. This means that the infection rate after March 1 to date has been 0.15 per cent. Dr Singh also informed that the number of people who tested positive for the Covid-19 infection in the city was reported less than 10 patients in the last 20 days. Moreover, Sangam city has not reported any death due to Covid-19 infection in the past 35 days. Expressing satisfaction over the constant fall in infection levels in the city in the past fortnight, Dr Singh has appealed to denizens of Sangam city to maintain social distancing and use of mask and sanitisers. He also appealed to the citizens to go for washing of hands frequently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/no-death-related-to-covid-19-in-prayagraj-in-past-35-days/articleshow/81537496.cms||---

Yadvinder slammed the BJP government for ignoring the farmers’ demand. “People of the nation saw such rulers in the British era. Farmers have been protesting for around four months and the Modi government should accept their demand. It should have been the government’s first work to ensure MSP after independence but every government failed to fulfill demands of farmers. The new farm laws will destroy the farming community, therefore, farmers are fighting to save their fasal and nasal,” he said. Full report on www.toi.inSpeaking with media persons, Yadvinder Singh said, “The time has come to show solidarity with farmers at the national level. The laws are anti-farmer and even the Union government has agreed to amend around 18 points.” He accused the Union government of ignoring 70% population dependent on agriculture and said the new laws would ruin the community. “The Punjab belt had started agitation with people of Haryana against the Britishers and always confronted the wrong policies and atrocities. We will take the agitation to the national level to mobilise farmers to fight against the laws,” Yadvinder asserted. On boycott of BJP-JJP leaders in villages, he said, society voted for them and sent them to the assembly and now society also has the right to stop their entry in villages. “Farmers will oppose leaders in villages if their demands are not met,” he maintained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bhagat-singhs-grandnephew-slams-centre/articleshow/81538785.cms||---
---||Delhi||37k identified with learning disabilities at schools||New Delhi: In 2019-20, around 37,312 students have been identified with learning disabilities, much higher than the 2018-19 count of 19,685, reveals the directorate of education (DoE) data. These students have joined Delhi government schools in Class VI and are now studying in classes VII and VIII. Since 2018-19, when Mission Buniyaad was launched, Delhi government also started Project Smile to help the students who are facing learning difficulties. They were identified by teachers through baseline assessment as readers and non-readers. To find their intelligence levels and areas of learning difficulties, a psychometric assessment was conducted by educational vocational guidance counsellors. The data was included in the latest outcome budget released by Delhi government. For 2020-21, the count will depend on the assessment report of Mission Buniyaad as and when schools reopen, states the government. In 2018-19, the government had set a target of 21,665 students while 19,685 were identified with learning disabilities. However, 37,312 students were identified with learning disabilities in 2019-20 against a target of 30,000. In both sets, 17,243 students were screened, and upon intervention, 46.2% of the students with learning difficulties have moved to the next level of reading, though the target was 70%. DoE officials did not respond to the query on why there has been an increase in the count of the students with learning disabilites. As per the assessment, students have been placed under different categories. Those students who scored 25 and above percentile are identified as having average or above average IQ level and have the potential to do well in studies, but face certain learning difficulties. Those scoring below 25 percentile are in the below-average IQ level and have difficulty in understanding and memorising. To help them, a special remediation plan for learning can be prepared by Hindi teachers in consultation with the counsellors. “It was believed that these students should at least know how to read in Hindi. Once they learn Hindi, they could move ahead. The project is good as it helps a lot of students to improve academic performance,” a government school teacher explained. For the students in the first category, Hindi teachers taught them online. The students whose problem areas were not mentioned in the assessment report were contacted through video calls for interaction. Among the non-assessed students were those absent for a long time, and whose names were struck off from school registers or who were issued school leaving certificates. The students falling under the category of child with special needs were also kept out as they have difficulty in performing tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/37k-identified-with-learning-disabilities-at-schools/articleshow/81558009.cms||Shradha Chettri

The Spice 2000 air-to-surface guidance weapon systems were the first product to roll out of KRAS’s Hyderabad facility that is located close to the Shamshabad international airport. The facility, touted as India’s first private missile production facility, was set up in joint venture by Kalyani Group and Rafael of Israel. “The first product that rolled out of our facility was the Spice 2000…we gave it in 2019 early (to Rafael, which in turn supplied to IAF) and the same Spice 2000 was used in the Balakot strike...this is the same serial number which got manufactured in this very, same premises,” KRAS CEO Rudra Jadeja said on the sidelines of the MRSAM missile kits delivery rollout to Rafael. He said KRAS has already delivered over 200 Spice 2000s worth $30 million for India as well as exports, of which 80% were for the Indian armed forces. He also pointed out that the Spice 2000 bombs supplied to Rafael for the Indian armed forces had a nearly 60% indigenous content. “All the MSME industries had pitched in like Centum Electronics, Cyient, Vam, Sigma Technologies,” Jadeja said, adding that only the explosives portion was added to the bomb by Rafael as that can not be done at this facility.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Counting for 2 MLC seats today||HYDERABAD: The fate of candidates of major political parties will be decided when counting of the two graduates MLC constituencies will be taken up on Wednesday. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has made elaborate arrangements for counting of over seven lakh votes in Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar (HRM) and Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda (WKN) constituencies. The polling was conducted on March 14. Election authorities said the counting will begin at 8 am. The annoucement of the results is likely to take a couple of days due to jumbo ballot boxes and counting process. Telangana chief electoral officer (CEO) Shashank Goel said bundling of 25 ballot papers each and jumbling of votes will take several hours. He said 56 tables each have been arranged for the counting process in two constituencies with over 800 each counting staff, who will work in three shifts. “To speed up the counting process, apart from deploying more staff, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has permitted us to appoint 11 additional assistant returning officers in HRM and nine AROs in WKN seats,” the CEO said. The outcome is crucial for the TRS, BJP and Congress. Independent candidate K Nageshwar in HRM and TJD candidate M Kodandaram in WKN are giving tough fight to the mainstream political parties. Since the graduates constituencies are spread over 75 assembly constituencies — 41 in HRM and 34 in WKN constituencies — the election is considered as ‘mini assembly’ polls. The TRS wants to stop the BJP from expanding its base in the state and also prove that there was no anti-incumbency factor, especially in the wake of allegations that both government employees and unemployed youth are against the ruling party. The BJP, which is riding high after its performance in Dubbak bypoll and GHMC elections, does not want to let the guard down and emerge as the only alternative to the TRS in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/counting-today-result-in-2-3-days/articleshow/81538801.cms||Koride Mahesh

The SKM has asked people to head to Delhi once more on March 23, men in basanti (yellow) turbans and the women in Basanti dupattas. The nationwide shutdown is called for March 26. BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said: “Shaheed Bhagat Singh opposed the British laws, while the farmers are into a similar battle against their own government.” Shaheed Bhagat Singh is one of the biggest icons of India and a household name in Punjab, and in 1907, the year he was born, his uncle, Ajit Singh, had started the ‘Pagri Sambhal Jatta’ movement, the slogans of which the farmers have used in their current model of protest. The British colonial government hanged Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev in the Lahore Central Jail on March 23, 1931, and threw their half-burnt bodies into the Sutlej river at Hussainiwala, not far from Lahore, a city that went to Pakistan in 1947. BKU (Ekta-Dhakaunda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh said: “We had even observed the 113th birth anniversary of Shaheed Bhagat Singh on September 27-28, 2020, during the protests in Punjab and now almost six months later, we are ready to observe his 90th martyrdom day the same way.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/skms-second-delhi-march-coming-on-shaheed-diwas/articleshow/81538802.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Allahabad||Cyber goons extorting with deepfake porn clips||Prayagraj: The sleuths of UP Police’s cybercrime cell are tightening the noose around a West UP-based gang of cyber fraudsters that has been blackmailing and extorting money from businessmen, professionals and students by using their images in deepfake porn videos and threatening to post them on social media. The cybercrime cell has been flooded with complaints where the fraudsters collected details about victims from their social media accounts and then contacted them by using pre-recorded videos of females to engage them in conversation. The fraudsters then used these frozen frames of the male victims and superimposed them on porn clips using deepfake technology. The fraudsters created fake profiles of females on social media networks. After preparing pornographic videos, fraudsters seek ransom ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 50,000 or more from victims by threatening to make their pornographic video public on social media. SP (Cyber Crime) Triveni Singh told TOI in Prayagraj on Tuesday, “There have been over 200 cases, including 19 from Prayagraj, in which cyber fraudsters made fake pornographic videos of victims and sought ransom by threatening to upload the videos on social media.” Most victims have locked their accounts on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram now, he added. The criminals are also taking advantage of such accounts which can be accessed by all and collected contact details and images, said Singh “The cyber cell has received over 200 complaints from victims who were being blackmailed. We started a probe and found victims’ faces had been morphed to create objectionable video clips. We have tracked the fraudsters by using technical intelligence and will arrest them,” Singh added. During investigation, we found that the fraudsters created fake profiles of females on Facebook, WhatsApp etc., by using photographs culled from the Internet, the SP said. “They then called the victims and engaged them in conversation. The accused had created over 200 fake Facebook accounts and used several bank accounts into which the victims were told to deposit or transfer money,” he added. Mewat, Bharatpur and Mathura, which form the tri-junction of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, have emerged as the latest hub of phishing and cyber frauds, said Singh. As devices in border areas often catch networks of different states and signals frequently change from mobile tower of one state to another, providing a shield to these criminals while making our task difficult, he added. The tri-junction is creating a ‘black spot’ of mobile networks that provides cover to these criminals as it becomes difficult to track the correct location of a device. The fraudsters procure SIMs in bulk from Northeast states on fake documents and discard them frequently to dodge law enforcement agencies. The extortion money is often channeled through multiple payment gateways and different e-wallets to create a maze of transactions, which can become difficult for police to trace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/cyber-goons-extorting-with-deepfake-porn-clips/articleshow/81537505.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||On Day 7, farm agitation heats up Haryana assembly debate||CHANDIGARH: Proceedings during the seventh day of the Haryana assembly’s budget session witnessed heated excahnges on Tuesday as MLAs from BJP-JJP coalition and Congress hit out at each other over the ongoing farmers’ protests against the three laws introduced last year by the Centre. Congress MLAs Induraj Narwal, Kiran Choudhry and Aftab Ahmed, and minister Kanwar Pal Gujjar, and BJP’s Aseem Goel and Abhay Singh Yadav kept the atmosphere charged up. So did, independent MLA from Mehem, Balraj Kundu, Discussions began with Ambala City MLA, Aseem Goel trying to to raise the protest outside his house issue. He circulated pictures of Congress leaders near the protest site, accusing them of doublespeak. Then Congress MLA from Baroda, Induraj Narwa started speaking on the plight of farmers at Singhu and Tikri border. He accused CM Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP government of snapping water and electricity connections to the protesters. Narwal praised political mentor and leader of opposition Bhupinder Hooda and his Rajya Sabha MP son, Deepender, for contribution farm stir. “In all, 300 farmers have died on the borders, tut government does not acknowledge their deaths. Even our leaders have started giving financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh each to the kin of those who died. Government should announce a compensation of Rs 50 lakh each to such families and a one government job,” said Narwal. Haryana parliamentary affairs minister Kanwar Pal Gujjar triggered a new argument by saying that these farmers were old and died a natural death. This led to a war of words between Gujjar and Hooda. Gujjar accused Congress leaders of sponsoring the agitation and shared a picture of Ambala incident. Hooda hit back, saying maintaining law and order was the job of government. “You are trying to pass the failure on us. Even after 300 deaths, we have not heard a single word from this government,” he said . Choudhry joined in by saying that protests were a right of everyone, but Gujjar wanted to gag the voice of farmers. Yadav, who brought the issue of loss of business and trade due to farmers agitations and sealed borders, claimed that a person from a special community is supporting. This triggered the ruckus again as Congress MLAs termed it as BJP’s way of giving caste colour to the farmers agitations.  This led to direct arguments among Yadav, Kadian, Hooda and Kiran Choudhary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/on-day-7-farm-agitation-heats-up-haryana-assembly-debate/articleshow/81538813.cms||Manvir Saini

With this, it has become the first state in the country to exclude land used for agriculture from the purview of tax by making amendments in the section of property tax. On Monday, Haryana government passed the bill in Vidhan Sabha during the ongoing budget session, making the provision in the property tax law. An official spokesman said according to the provisions mentioned in serial number 49 of List-II (state list) of the 7th schedule of the Constitution of India, state governments have the right to levy property tax on lands and buildings. On the basis of this, property tax is levied on lands and buildings by all states, including Haryana. With the latest amendment, a provision has been made to levy property tax only on the basis of the value of the property and to set a minimum rate for property tax. Municipalities will also have the right to levy property tax at higher than these minimum rates. This is in line with the recommendation of the ministry of housing and urban affairs, Government of India. These recommendations include notifying the floor rate of property tax as per the prevailing circle/guideline rates and putting in place a system of periodic increase in line with price increase. As a result of implementing these reforms in property tax, the state will get an additional 0.25% of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) as loan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-property-tax-on-agri-land-in-hry-urban-areas/articleshow/81538823.cms||---

Though the overall number of cases seems to be under control, more admissions are worrying health officials. Admissions have reportedly doubled at Gandhi Hospital, which was once Covid-19 nodal centre of the state, in the past few days. “Daily 30 cases were being reported at Gandhi till recently. Now, around 60 patients are getting admitted for the past few days. We have enough beds to accommodate,” health department sources said. Apart from Hyderabad, most cases are being reported from districts like Karimnagar, Nizamabad and Adilabad.

Many are concerned about increasing number of cases and do not want to take chances, sources said. However, Gandhi Hospital sources denied there was any chance of new strains leading more number of cases. Though the number of beds were enough now, they might be increased, if required. Officials also denied any genetic study of the virus strains. “Things are under control, we can say this is only a spurt, but people should not lower the guard,” Rangareddy DMHO Dr Swarjya Lakshmi said. “A few days ago, we had observed a slight increase in cases in urban areas,” she added.

The review submitted by visitors will automatically transfer to the department concerned in the west zone and help officials do online monitoring of these complexes. The civic body is targeting to address the complaints received within an hour. Explaining how the system is more efficient in comparison to the existing one, an SDMC official said that earlier the complaints filed online were being sent to the headquarters and then zonal office, which is why it was taking time to address the issues. “Also, earlier the visitors had to rate the condition/maintenance of toilets between excellent, good, satisfying, bad and very bad. But these feedbacks were not enough to understand exactly what problems were being faced in a complex. To simplify things, we introduced changes and now visitors will have the option to exactly point out the missing/poor facility at the complex,” said Rajiv Jain, SDMC’s nodal officer for Swachh Bharat Mission. After scanning the QR Code, toilet users will need to ensure the presence of five parameters at toilet complexes, including availability of electricity, water, soap, cleanliness of toilet premises and toilet seat in Yes/No. “Toilet users will have to scan the QR code, which will automatically take them to the SDMC website and then they can submit a reply,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/scan-code-give-review-of-hygiene-at-toilets/articleshow/81537529.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Web series maker ‘honey-trapped’, abducted and robbed of Rs 1.6 lakh||MUMBAI: In a suspected case of honey-trap, a starlet and three of her aides abducted a 42-year-old web series maker in his own vehicle and drove him around Ghatkopar-Sion before extorting over Rs 1.4 lakh from him. The incident took place on March 10. Pantnagar police have begun a probe, but are still to make arrests. In early March, an acquaintance told the victim, a Kandivli resident, that a starlet was keen to be cast in a series. He invited her for an audition on March 6, where the 24-year-old aspiring model told him she was ready to do bold roles. They had a conversation, following which they got intimate. Later, the woman’s boyfriend called him up, accused him of exploiting her and threatened to file rape charges. While the filmmaker tried to explain that she had consented to having relations with him, the boyfriend was not convinced. The victim kept getting calls from the boyfriend and was summoned to Ghatkopar on March 10. He drove down from Kandivli in his car. At Arunkumar Vaidya Garden in Ghatkopar (E), the model and her three male associates intercepted his car and got in. The group roughed him up besides verbally abusing him. At knifepoint, the men got him to drive the vehicle to Wadala and then to Sion. “The two demanded Rs 4 lakh from him before snatching his phone to transfer the money from his UPI-based payment application,” a police officer said. But since the duo was not well-versed with the app and ended up keying in wrong OTPs repeatedly, they could transfer only Rs 1.4 lakh. They then got him to halt the vehicle at an ATM in Sion and forced him to withdraw Rs 20,000. After taking his money, they got out of the car, threatening him. Although shaken, the victim eventually approached Kandivli police on March 13. An FIR was registered and the case was transferred to Pantnagar police station on Monday. “He was honey-trapped. We are probing the possibility of the group similarly duping others. We are checking call data records and will make arrests soon,” said an officer of Pantnagar police station.

The police claimed to have rescued the boy near the Damupur Kareli area from the clutches of the kidnappers. SP (City) Dinesh Kumar Singh told reporters, "initial investigations revealed that a group of four persons, including a classmate of the student, allegedly kidnapped a 17-year-old student outside the school campus located at Civil Lines area under the limits of Civil Lines police station on Tuesday afternoon”. He further added, "As the police received information regarding the kidnapping of a class XIth student, police of Kareli, Dhoomanganj and Civil Lines swung into action and the alleged kidnappers left the student near Damupur Kareli road and escaped”. Three out of four kidnappers were residents of the Kareli area. SP, meanwhile, said that police have been probing the incident thoroughly and that two police teams had been dispatched to ensure the arrest of kidnappers. Investigations also revealed that all three persons including a classmate had forced the class XIth student to sit inside the SUV as soon as he came out from the school campus and that the SUV moved towards the Kareli area.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Builder an old foe of Chhota Rajan, approver was told||MUMBAI: Extradited gangstger Chhota Rajan, currently serving life sentence for the 2011 murder of journalist J Dey, was on Tuesday sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for the 2013 attempted murder of builder Ajay Gosaliya. Accused-turned-approver Amit Sinha was granted pardon. The court ordered his release from Thane Central Prison, if he was not required in any other offence. “The state to provide proper security to approver, if required,” the court said. Among the other convicted accused are Kaushik Rajgour, Arvind Shinde, Sunil Kumar, Vilas Bharti, Prakash Nikam and Satish Kalya. The accused were found guilty under sections of the Indian Penal Code and Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (Mcoca). Kalya’s advocate Santosh Deshpande said he would move Bombay high court against the conviction. Gosaliya in his deposition told the court he was exiting the mall when three armed men standing there fired at him. He tried to flee, but slipped and fell since it was drizzling. He said the accused continued to shoot at him, but he managed to escape into the mall and, at his behest, the guard closed the gate. The accused then fled. Gosaliya said he sustained four bullet injuries. He identified Nikam as one of the shooters. One of the accused, Rajendra Yadav, had absconded earlier after he was taken to be produced before a judge in MP. The court on Tuesday said apparently there were lapses on the part of the police officer who took the accused to be produced before the special judge and also the superintendent of Datiya Jail (MP) in releasing him without sending him back to Thane Central Prison. “Therefore, the superintendent of police of the police station, Bhander (MP), and the superior authority of superintendent of Datiya Jail to conduct an inquiry and submit report to this court within three months,” the court said. The approver had told the court that co-accused Rajgaur told him to get in touch with Kalya. He said he agreed to make arrangements for the assault as he needed money for his mother’s cancer treatment. He alleged Kalya told him if Gosaliya died, the Chhota Rajan gang would benefit. Sinha further said he was also told Gosaliya was Rajan’s old enemy and an earlier attempt to kill him had failed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaibuilder-an-old-foe-of-chhota-rajan-approver-was-told/articleshow/81538924.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Goa||Late presentation of Covid cases leading to delayed diagnosis: Goa Medical College||PANAJI: With lethargy setting in, people seem to have dropped their guard and are not cautious of the symptoms of Covid-19. This has been indicated by the fact that there has been late reporting, thus leading to delayed diagnosis and deaths due to complications, doctors have said. A 26-year-old man from Morlem who died in Goa Medical College (GMC) on Monday, was rushed to the hospital two days prior. Last week, a 38-year-old woman from South Goa was brought dead to Hospicio hospital. She did not suffer from any comorbid condition. On Tuesday, the state reported four Covid deaths, the highest single-day toll since mid-February. “Of late, we are seeing late presentations of cases. People are least bothered, ” said Dr S M Bandekar, dean Goa Medical College. Family members of the 38-year-old woman told health authorities during inquiry that she did not exhibit any symptoms that warranted their attention. Bandekar said the family was not telling the truth and there ought to have been symptoms. The 26-year-old man from Morlem, who had tuberculosis as comorbidity, was presented very late. His positive status became apparent only after he was admitted to GMC when it was too late to reverse his condition. State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said people should not delay in getting tested if they experience any of the symptoms of Covid-19. They will get immediate medical attention, if needed, when tested positive. All patients who are home isolated are monitored by health centres and arrangements are made to shift a patient to hospital if his parameters are found to be of concern. Overall hospital admissions have dropped since last month. On an average 10 to 12 patients are admitted to hospital in a day, but the recent trend of late presentation of patients has left doctors worried. The state witnessed a similar trend in August -September last year when cases peaked. “The present scenario is no match to the days when the state was reporting ten to 12 days Covid-related deaths a day. But today, people have become complacent, that may make them ignore their condition if they have contracted the virus. It is not a good sign,” said another officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/late-presentation-of-covid-cases-leading-to-delayed-diagnosis-gmc/articleshow/81538865.cms||---

---||Mumbai||BMC gets expert panel nod to hike reclamation for coastal road by 23%||MUMBAI: BMC can now go full steam with construction of Phase I of the coastal road project from Marine Drive to Worli. The environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee (EAC) has granted BMC permission for additional reclamation. Earlier, BMC had permission for reclaiming 90 hectares but required 111 hectares (23% more) for the coastal road on this stretch. Deepak Apte, chairperson of the committee, recused himself from the decision-making process for the proposal, citing “conflict of interest”. In its application for additional reclamation, BMC said it had failed to factor in a 14.9 hectare sea wall necessary for protection. This increased the total reclamation to 96.5 hectares. It also informed EAC it will be reclaiming 0.2 hectare in the lagoon area between Priyadarshini Park and the promenade for ease of movement for pedestrians. This is included in the 111 hectares.While approving the project, EAC directed BMC to inform the Supreme Court and high court of the revised coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearance and take necessary approval, if deemed fit. BMC is required to adhere to all the conditions stipulated by Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority. Construction and reclamation activities are to be in accordance with CRZ Notification 2011. Conservation of corals is to be done as per a biodiversity management plan. Reclaimed surfaces are to be monitored for the growth of marine life/intertidal habitats. BMC has been directed to explore establishment of artificial reefs to promote marine biodiversity in consultation with Mangrove Foundation of Maharashtra through the 2% corporate environment responsibility funds BMC had provided it. The shoreline of the entire project site and sea levels at a minimum of four locations along the coastal road are to be monitored annually using automated gauges. Environmentalist Debi Goenka expressed disappointment saying EAC did not even consider their suggestions and objections. “It has ignored the fact that BMC illegally started reclaiming the extra area and the fact that most BMC members were not present at the hearing. Even worse, the additional municipal commissioner who is in charge of the project did not recuse herself from the hearing. Surprisingly, Dr Apte, who chaired the EAC in May 2017, has now declared that he was conflicted and did not participate in this meeting.” Goenka added the coastal road is an “extremely expensive project that has completely destroyed the sea view, the livelihood of the fisher folk, the aesthetics and the environment. And it will not help solve the traffic problem either.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-gets-expert-panel-nod-to-hike-reclamation-for-coastal-road-by-23/articleshow/81540805.cms||Clara Lewis

---||Goa||Govt to continue special vaccination drive, aims to target more people||PANAJI: The health department has decided to continue with the special vaccination camps for a few more days in order to inoculate as many people as possible in the target population. During the past two days of the mega drive held at 33 centres, 9,755 people – sixty plus, and 45 to 59-year-olds having comorbidities – were vaccinated with the first dose. “We will continue with the camps till the response is good. If the footfalls drop at any centre, vaccinations at that centre will be discontinued. The response so far has been good,” said a health official. On Tuesday, 5,502 people comprising healthcare workers, frontline workers and people from the two categories of age groups, were vaccinated. Of these, 4,895 people were sixty-plus, with comorbidities. The health officer said that while each centre aims to vaccinate 100 to 150 people a day, centres like Margao, Panaji and Vasco cover more people as they have bigger jurisdictions with higher concentrations of population. In two months, the health services expects to complete vaccinating the target population, but it will depend on the response from people, which has been moderate so far. Another official said that the health department will have to adopt other measures to accelerate vaccination and meet its target of vaccinating 3 lakh target population as early as possible. “I would say, people are still slow in coming forward to take the vaccine shots. They want to, but are hesitant,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-to-continue-special-vaccination-drive-aims-to-target-more-people/articleshow/81538919.cms||---

---||Mumbai||‘Chargesheet in TRP case attempt to target Arnab Goswami’||MUMBAI: The chargesheet filed in the TRP rigging case is nothing but an attempt to target Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, submitted senior counsel Ashok Mundergi on Tuesday before Bombay high court. Goswami’s counsel Mundergi also drew attention of the high court bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale to the fact that the now suspended API Sachin Waze was in-charge of the probe. He alleged the first informant, Hansa Research group, was aware of the rigging since June 2020 and had been given the information by Waze and another officer. But an FIR was registered on October 6, 2020 by Kandivli police station claiming police had received secret information from an employee of Hansa Research group. Mundergi also said just two days after the FIR was lodged, the Mumbai police commissioner held a press conference claiming the involvement of Republic TV based allegedly on a report by Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC). The counsel said BARC had later clarified in writing that no such inquiry was on against Republic TV. Referring to Waze, Mundergi said, “The officer is also very controversial. The officer is in the news and close to the party in power.” Goswami and ARG Outlier, which owns Republic TV, had last year petitioned the HC to quash the FIR registered by Kandivli police in the TRP case. Neither are named in the FIR and, hence, their quashing petition is not maintainable is the state’s stand. But Mundergi argued that not naming him was also meant to defeat his rights. His plea is maintainable as the chargesheet has referred to the company as the “chalak-malak” (operator and owner), said the counsel, adding not naming Goswami is aimed at keeping investigation open-ended and to ensure that people connected with the channel can be harassed. The HC is hearing the plea and Goswami’s counsel will continue his submissions on Wednesday. Goswami has also sought transfer of the TRP case probe to the CBI or any other independent agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/chargesheet-in-trp-case-attempt-to-target-arnab-in-mumbai/articleshow/81540389.cms||---

The child was sexually assaulted on January 18 this year when she had gone to a nearby field to bring fodder for the cattle, when a local Arun, son of Rajesh, abducted her and took her to a mustard field where he raped her. The girl’s shrieks drew the attention of farmers working in adjoining fields. They rushed to her rescue but the crook managed to flee from the spot. Senior superintendent of police, Etawah, Akash Tomar said the incident had occurred around 3pm on January 18, and subsequently an FIR was registered at Badhpura police station. The accused was arrested from Chambal river bridge in the district on January 19 following a shootout. The statement of the victim was recorded and the chargesheet was filed in the court on February 1. “The charges against the accused were found to be true under Sections 376 AB (rape, a section applied when the victim is under 12) of Indian Penal Code and POCSO Act,” said Tomar. Additional district and sessions judge Etawah, Kashi Prasad Singh Yadav, after inspecting evidence and hearing the two sides pronounced the verdict on Tuesday, said standing counsel Ajit Tomar. “This case is in the rarest of rare category. The conviction and sentence came in just 57 days,” he added. The girl’s parents were present in the hearing and said Arun had committed a heinous crime and deserved nothing less. Other than life imprisonment, the court also slapped a penalty of Rs 50,000 on Arun. “The accused was convicted in time due to constant supervision and follow up. Justice has been delivered in record time,” the SSP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/man-sentenced-to-life-for-raping4-year-old-girl-in-record-57-days/articleshow/81537545.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Opposition leader in the assembly Devendra Fadnavis said CM Uddhav Thackeray was protecting Sharjeel Usmani, who has been accused of making derogatory remarks about Hindu society at Elgar Parishad in Pune this January.

---||Kolkata||Three-way underpass plan at Chingrighata||Kolkata: A three-way pedestrian underpass will come up to ease the traffic congestion at Chingrighata crossing Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), the implementing agency of the New Garia-Airport Metro corridor that passes through Chingrighata and EM Bypass, has agreed to build the underpass. It is hiring a consultant to fix the alignment of the underpass, following which the design will be drawn up. Around Rs 15 crore may be required for the project and the cost will be shared by RVNL and KMDA, the keepers of EM Bypass. KMDA is currently constructing a foot overbridge (FOB) at this crossing. In a meeting with RVNL and various agencies, KMDA recently granted the NOC for construction of a viaduct between piers 318 and 319 on conditions that the former would build the three-way underpass. IIT-Kharagpur has recommended the construction of the underpass at Chingrighata, where many roads meet from the Sector V-end, Beliaghata and Chaulpatty. It is one of the most critical intersections on the 29km EM Bypass. In February 2018, two students had been killed and the mob fury that followed had left five buses torched and many cars damaged. A senior RVNL engineer said, “We shall build the underpass only after the two piers have been built so that less cordoning is needed. The alignment’s approval is crucial because the funds for the underpass will be carved out of the main project cost.” Meanwhile, work is in full swing for the FOB aimed at bringing down the fatality rate of one of the city’s accident hotspots. The FOB, consisting of staircase and escalator facilities, will connect Chaulpatty Road and Jal Vayu Vihar over EM Bypass till the arterial road next to the eastern drainage canal at the Chingrighata crossing. IIT-Kharagpur has insisted that the underpass be built at the Chingrighata crossing. The road along Jal Vayu Vihar near the crossing has already been widened. A KMDA engineer said, “RVNL will start the construction of the two piers and the viaduct along them soon. So, it was decided that the underpass should also built by the same agency. It will be easier if RVNL does everything related to the underpass.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/three-way-underpass-plan-at-chingrighata/articleshow/81537572.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘Rahul called for generation shift’||The Congress party, for the first time, has attempted a revolutionary change while deciding its candidates for assembly election by replacing some of its veterans with fresh faces. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran, who is back from New Delhi after a busy week, speaks to TOI on how the party could bring about a generation change in the list. How difficult was the candidate selection process and how could you manage so many new faces when there was hectic lobbying from the seniors and group managers? Unlike in the past it was a laborious task to find out the most eligible candidates. In January, we had a meeting with AICC leader Rahul Gandhi, in which he said “I want a generation change” while finding the candidates. He also said if you are not coming with a list of the most deserving candidates, then he was not going to approve it. The message was loud and clear for all the leaders here. The process began from there. For the first time the screening committee of the AICC came to Kerala to meet the leaders and the workers at the grassroots level. You should not believe that the list was made all of a sudden. All the names of the fresh faces were selected through a long process. It is a fact that there was lobbying in a few places and we had to accommodate a few names. There was pressure on us and also on the high command on a few names. But you look at the larger picture. What we had claimed in the beginning, we have achieved it while finalising the names. But the party is facing severe opposition in several constituencies and also from a few senior leaders. How are you going to persuade them? There is no dearth of deserving candidates and leaders in the Congress. But in the process of finding candidates for an assembly election, it is not possible to satisfy all the deserved leaders. It is not new that some rumbling happens in the candidate selection process. Senior leaders of the party are in dialogue with them and have made it clear that their focus now should be on bringing back the UDF to power. There will definitely be an intervention from the part of the KPCC to settle the issues raised by a few leaders. It is not just the parliamentary positions that everyone should look for. They will have responsibilities in the party after the elections. They will be getting due recognition. Don’t you think that you have taken up a big challenge by bringing in more new faces? The responsibility also lies with the leadership to see to it that they are winning. Yes, it is very true. It is a very huge challenge for us to ensure that all the fresh faces emerge victorious. Even though they lack experience in electioneering, all of them have a clean image and they have worked in the grassroots level. They have strong bonding with the people, which we will be exploiting. All of them are very committed and have good political sense. The entire party machinery will be there to support our new kids. The Congress gave so much importance to Nemom. Why was it and what benefit are you expecting by fielding a senior leader like K Muraleedharan there? It was the decision of the party that we should put up a strong fight against the BJP. The victory of their candidate in the last election was used as a tool to attack the Congress. Hence the party high command was very particular that we should take on the BJP at Nemom. It will have a strong impact in all the constituencies. Now see the change that has happened in Nemom, the fight is between the Congress and the BJP there. The message that the Congress is prepared to take on the BJP in the state will greatly influence the voters. The hide and seek game blamed against the Congress will now have no effect. The people of Kerala have always welcomed such bold decisions. The party is sure that it will have a strong impact in other constituencies too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/rahul-called-for-generation-shift/articleshow/81538982.cms||Rajiv G

For students of all the lower classes, teaching is still taking place online.  As the start of the new academic year 2021-22 approaches, it is still not clear how classes are planned to be held then. Schools have been asked by DoE to provide details of how many computers are available in the school laboratory and how many of them are in working condition, and whether internet connectivity is provided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/doe-seeks-info-on-computer-teachers-lab-infra-in-schools/articleshow/81539004.cms||---

In a joint meeting on Monday evening held at Surat textile market, the traders also decided to seek permission from local authorities to call for a public meeting over the issue.Seven different associations of traders have formed a joint front — Vyapari Ekta Manch (VEM) — to find a solution to the issue of discount and transportation charges with the Federation of Gujarat Weavers’ Association (FOGWA). Earlier, FOGWA announced that they will not pay delivery charges of 10 paisa per metre for delivery of grey cloth to traders. Weavers are citing reasons for the rising cost of fuel and transportation charges for the change in trade deals. Till now, weavers used to pay the transportation charges. In the meeting, representatives of South Gujarat Textile Traders Association (SGTTA), Surat Mercantile Association (SMA), Vyapar Pragati Sangh (VPS), Textile Traders Welfare Committee (TTWC), Textile Youth Brigade (TYB) and Gujarat Traders (GT) were present. Members of various textile markets were also present in the meeting. The traders have decided that they will purchase grey cloth from weavers only if they get a 5% discount and one percent brokerage is paid by the weaver. They also renewed their demand for the transportation cost. “It is a unanimous decision by the textile traders to not accept the demand of weavers for transportation cost. Instead, we are demanding that we should get the discount and the brokerage should be paid by the weaver like it was done before GST was introduced,” said a textile trader. But FOGWA remains defiant on the traders’ demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/miffed-traders-decide-not-to-take-delivery-of-grey-cloth-from-today/articleshow/81536572.cms||---
---||Surat||Fake Covid restrictions go viral, create panic among people||Surat: Cyber Crime police booked some unidentified person on Tuesday for creating a fake circular related to Covid-19 restrictions and making it viral on social media. The circular created panic among citizens who bombarded the police with inquiries about the circular. The fake circular has been issued in the name of Dr P S Patel, special commissioner of police. City police clarified that there is no special commissioner in city police with the name of P S Patel. Top city police officials also ordered an investigation into the matter but cops are yet to find any clue about how the letter came into circulation. The fake circular claims that shopping malls, multiplexes, theatres, gymnasiums and swimming pools are ordered to remain closed for indefinite period in Rander, Athwa, Limbayat, Varachha and Katargam area. Also that no religious or political function will also be allowed. At the end, the circular also claims at any point a complete lockdown can be declared in the city considering the current situation. ‘Lockdown Part - 2’ and ‘Trailer Started Today’ have been highlighted in bold letters at the bottom of the circular. “The circular came to the knowledge of the police on Tuesday and it is fake. There is no such officer and city police have not issued any orders related to Covid-19 restrictions as claimed in the circular,” said a police official. “Police are working to identify the source of the circular. The accused will be nabbed soon,” said police, adding that that accused has been booked for creating panic and also for making forged documents under various sections of Indian Penal Code, IT Act and Disaster Management Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/fake-covid-restrictions-go-viral-create-panic-among-people/articleshow/81536591.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Three die over three days in suspected water contamination zone||KOLKATA: A four-year-old girl from the Bhowanipore area, where drinking water is suspected to have been contamination, died on Monday night after complaining of severe cramps in the stomach, which she started to get four days ago. She is the third person from the area to have died of similar health complaints. Sources in the KMC confirmed the latest death, that of the child, who lived in a slum near Sashisekhar Bose Row. After she complained of severe stomach pain four days ago, she was taken to an NGO-run healthcare centre. But her condition deteriorated and she died on Monday night. The other deceased were a civic worker living in KMC quarters on Sashisekhar Bose Row and a woman inmate at Alipore correctional home, both of whom died on Saturday. More than 70 residents of these two neighbourhoods also fell ill after drinking the suspected contaminated water four days ago. Locals have stopped drinking water from taps and have been using KMC tankers. Shocked by the back-to-back deaths, the KMC brass have instructed the water supply department to collect samples of tap water and potable water from the affected areas of Bijay Bose Road and Sashisekhar Bose Row. The KMC has also set up a medical camp and civic health workers have been distributing medicines and ORS. “We have asked residents to avoid drinking water from the supply line. For a few more days, they will have to depend on tanker water, which is being supplied by the civic body,” said a KMC health department senior official on Tuesday. Rakesh Shaw, a resident of a slum adjacent to Sashisekhar Bose Row, said they were rattled by the deaths. Taking no more chance, they have been collecting drinking water from the tankers that have been coming to their areas twice a day. While the water supply department collected samples from the affected zone and sent them for testing, civic engineers have been trying to zero in on the possible breach in water and drainage pipe that had probably led to the contamination. “We have taken precautionary steps to prevent further pain for residents. We are waiting for the lab results,” KMC board of administrators chairman Firhad Hakim said on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3-die-over-3-days-in-suspected-water-contamination-zone/articleshow/81537634.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Goa||Players brave bio-bubble for five months, but say ‘not again’||Panaji: Everyone wanted to get out of the bio-bubble at the first given opportunity. The players were exhausted, but unlike some of their counterparts in other Asian countries, they did not sneak out at night. Even if they did, we wouldn’t know, as no player tested positive for Covid-19, despite tests being conducted every 72 hours. The coaches had more time for training and off-field sessions, but not everyone remained attentive all the time. The officials, understandably, just wanted to pack their bags for home after the conclusion of the Indian Super League (ISL). It was that kind of season. But given the coronavirus pandemic that changed the world, there appeared to be no other way. “What the league has done is nothing short of a miracle. We’ve had a full-fledged league at a time when even the IPL (Indian Premier League) was played abroad,” said Ravi Puskur, director of football at FC Goa. This was the longest ISL season ever with SC East Bengal’s entry making it 11 teams. Despite the uncertainty in the beginning and a late start to pre-season training, the format remained the same. It meant 110 matches during the league stage, and five during playoffs. “When we first heard that players would need to be kept inside for almost six months, we didn’t know what to do. We were hearing of clubs in the Premier League missing players due to Covid-19. This was not done anywhere else in the world, but in the end, we managed to overcome all hiccups. Whether we can all do it again, I am not sure,” said Puskur. It wasn’t an easy task, say those involved with organisation of the league. There were 18 bio-secure bubbles across 14 hotels in Goa, nearly 70,000 RT-PCR tests on 1635 people – tested every 72 hours on an average. Even journalists who were allowed to report the playoff matches had to first take a test, wait for the result and only then take your seat at the stadium. The cost? An estimated Rs 17 crore on Covid testing and other related activities, which includes buying 26,000 N95 masks. There was more to be done. Refurbishment of the pitches in Goa – three stadiums and eight training venues – involved considerable expense, while installation of floodlights, usage of generators, central security and housekeeping agencies meant Rs 20 crore was spent. “It was very challenging to live in the bubble for more than five months. It was my biggest challenge. But I am lucky, because of the profile of the persons I have been working with. It's amazing. We are a family on and off the pitch," said Mumbai City FC’s champion coach Sergio Lobera. All players are now at home with their families – except FC Goa who are back at the team hotel, inside another bio-bubble for the AFC Champions League -- and are waiting for news of the next season. At least for now, the news isn’t so good. Over the past week, India has registered the highest spike in the number of fresh cases since mid-December. In some states, there are fears that a new wave of Covid-19 infections is around the corner. “Players are not willing to commit their future to clubs here unless they know that there won’t be another bubble. It won’t be easy convincing the foreign players,” said a club official involved in the signing of players. A leading foreign striker, for example, has told his representative that he would prefer to ply his trade at home, even if the money on offer here is much more. “The money is good, there are enough luxuries at the team hotel and the players are taken care of really well. But I don’t think the foreigners would want to go through this all over again,” said a player representative, who asked not to be named. The organisers, though, are keeping their options open. Early plans suggest the next edition of the league will kick off in September. If things don’t improve, it’s going to be a repeat of 2020-21. The league must go on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/players-brave-bio-bubble-for-five-months-but-say-not-again/articleshow/81557185.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Kalyan taluka police have registered a case against unknown persons based on a complaint by animal rights group Cheersfurever Foundation. “Prima facie, it looks like a case of mass poisoning of dogs. Three dog carcasses have been sent for post-mortem examination,” assistant commissioner of police (ACB) Sudhir Kudalkar, who helped the activists lodge the complaint, said. Activists Chetan Chavan, Swapnil Kamble and Pratika Agarwal told TOI that some of the carcasses were dumped in a swamp near the temple. The activists plan to hold an awareness drive to educate locals that it is illegal to harm or kill animals. Honorary district animal welfare officer Mitesh Jain said: “The post-mortem report is awaited, but it is apparent that the dogs were poisoned to death. The birds that fed on the food given to the strays also died.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiin-titwala-20-dogs-and-birds-poisoned-to-death-fir-filed/articleshow/81539051.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Kolkata||Three of a family from Siliguri found dead in Kolkata hotel||KOLKATA/SILIGURI: Three members of a family from Siliguri were found dead at a central Kolkata hotel on Tuesday morning. The family had checked into the hotel on Sunday. Cops suspect that they had ended their lives by consuming poison. Debt and illness might have been the reasons that could have led the family to take the extreme step. Police are also trying to find out whether Sunit’s illness played any role behind the incident. The three were identified as Sushil Kumar Bansal (66), his wife, Chanda Devi Bansal (60), and his son, Sunit Kumar Bansal (45). The incident was reported from a fourth-floor room of a hotel on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road. The family hailed from Punjabipara under Ward 40 of Sevoke Road in Sliguri. Neighbours claimed that the entire family of six had left for Hyderabad about 45 days ago for Sunit’s treatment after he developed some nerve disorder. “We are trying to contact Sunit’s wife,” said a police officer. While the bodies have been sent for autopsy, bottles of cold drinks and another that possibly contained poison have been sent for forensic tests, said police. “They ordered dinner around 9.30pm. After that they did not leave the room. On Monday, hotel staff repeatedly knocked on their door but received no response,” said DC (Central) Rupesh Kumar. The employees at the hotel said they alerted the New Market police after a foul smell emitted from the room. “The door was opened in the presence of cops and the three were found unconscious. A suicide note was also found, in which they mentioned that they were ending their lives,” said Kumar. The family was into manufacturing gunny bags. “The business was not running well and they had been borrowing money to survive. This is what we have got to know during the initial investigations. They had checked into the hotel, claiming that they were to consult a senior doctor. We are waiting for their family members to arrive. We have got some CCTV footage from the reception and the post-mortem report will help us ascertain the exact cause and time of death. Prima facie, it seems that they killed themselves early on Monday morning,” said the officer. TOI found that their house in Siliguri was locked. The neighbours said that they had left the house almost one and a half months ago for Sunit’s treatment. “The family preferred to keep to themselves,” said a neighbour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3-of-a-family-from-siliguri-found-dead-in-city-hotel/articleshow/81537631.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||CM Arvind Kejriwal announces release of Rs 28 crore to DU colleges||NEW DELHI: In what could be a sign of a resolution between Delhi government and the 12 Delhi University colleges fully funded by it, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday met their principals and announced that Rs 28.2 crore funds would be released to the institutions. After the meeting, Kejriwal said Delhi government would invite the DU acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi to have a dialogue with him on the pending issues. The principals said they were elated with the CM’s response and his intent for dialogue. Deputy CM and education minister Manish Sisodia said the colleges should have confidence in Delhi government. “It’s an unfair and impractical approach to demand funds from one agency, but follow the pattern of assistance of another. There should be 100% transparency in accounts and budgets, which is required to bridge the gap between Delhi government and Delhi University,” he added. “I have been reading news reports that the teaching staff is not getting salaries. Our government is recognised for working to improve the education and health sectors. But there has been an unwarranted misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the intentions of Delhi government. I want to clarify to everyone that we are on the same side of the table,” added Kejriwal. The CM said, “Today is a new beginning. We understand the plight of the staff and teachers and do not want their salaries to stop even if the matter is sub judice. We will release the amount so that they don’t suffer. We will ask the court to resolve the issue concerning what expenditure should be under what head.” Sisodia said Delhi government didn’t have any record of appointment of staff before 2010, but was expected to pay their salaries. “The colleges must take permission from Delhi government before appointing staff because we are funding their salaries and expenses. If that doesn’t happen, it will reflect as an impractical and unfair approach on the part of Delhi University,” added the minister. Payal Mago, the principal of Shaheed Rajguru College that didn’t receive funds last week, stated that she was relieved. “The CM assured us that they would assist the colleges and support infrastructure development. The matter was resolved with the help of the governing body chairperson Ila Srivastava and other members who sought a dialogue after which the CM and education minister said they would release the funds,” she added. Hem Chand Jain, principal of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, said, “We told the CM that the funding issue was not only affecting the college and salaries, but also teaching. We also told him that the government’s suggestions to use Student Society Funds was not feasible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-announces-release-of-rs-28cr-to-du-colleges/articleshow/81537586.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad’s Gland Pharma to make 252 million doses of Sputnik V||HYDERABAD: Gland Pharma, which is based out of Hyderabad, has entered into an agreement with Russian sovereign wealth fund, Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), to manufacture and supply 252 million (25.2 crore) doses of Russian Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V. The company said on Tuesday that it expects to commence production of Sputnik V at its facilities in Hyderabad from the third quarter of 2021, with deliveries estimated to start from the fourth quarter of 2021. News of the tie-up sent the scrip of the company, which listed on Indian bourses in November 2020, soaring to a record high of Rs 2,784.45 a share on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Tuesday, before settling down to close nearly 7% up at Rs 2,718.65 a share as compared to the previous day’s closing price. “Under the terms of the agreement, Gland Pharma will first undertake technology transfer of the drug substance to its manufacturing facilities. After successful technology transfer, Gland Pharma will then undertake manufacturing of drug substance and drug product filling into vials under aseptic conditions,” it said in the regulatory filing. However, it was not clear whether the Sputnik V doses that Gland Pharma will churn out are meant solely for the Indian market or for global supplies as well. The pharma company, which was set up by PVN Raju in 1978 but is now majority owned by Fosun Pharma of China, said it will be leveraging its expertise in manufacturing sterile injectables at scale for the production of Sputnik V and establishing a stable supply of Covid-19 vaccines. Gland Pharma said this is the first of multiple partnerships being explored by the company to leverage its manufacturing capacity and capabilities to support global supply of Covid-19 vaccine and will see it utilise its drug substance and drug product facilities at its sites in Hyderabad. The latest tie-up comes even as Sputnik V has already applied for emergency use authorisation (EUA) to the Indian drug regulator. However, in February end, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, which is conducting Phase II/III trials on 1,600 volunteers in India as part of a bridging study to the larger global trials, was asked to submit safety and immunogenicity data of the Indian trials. Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Labs had joined hands with RDIF in September 2020 for conducting clinical trials and distribution of 100 million doses of vaccine in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyds-gland-pharma-to-make-252m-doses-of-sputnik-v/articleshow/81539029.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Goa||Govt to conduct e-auction of iron ore on March 24||PANAJI: The directorate of mines and geology will be e-auctioning over 1.6MT iron ore on March 24. The e-auction of iron ore is lying at mines Rivona, Collem, Advapal, Gavanem, Sonvalim, Patiem/Tudou, Dignem, Pale, Bategal, Mina, Colomba/Sulcorna, Uguem, Shigao, and plants at Vagush, Tollem, besides Joleracho Dongor, Kotambi jetty, among others. TOI was the first to report that the state government will be e-auctioning iron ore in March. The e-auction is being conducted to generate revenue for the state government, which is under pressure due to the pandemic. TOI had reported in November last year that of the 3MT iron ore that was to be e-auctioned, only 1.1MT was purchased in which thirteen mining companies participated. With only 36.9% of the ore being sold, the revenue was not as per the state’s expectation. The previous e-auction held in May 2020, received a poor response largely because no mining company wanted to invest in the ore during the monsoon. In 2012, a Supreme Court judgment had declared mining carried out after 2007 illegal and the ore lying at jetties and plots was subsequently declared state property. The government had then identified 15MT of ore of which around 12MT had already been e-auctioned. On March 15, 2018, mining in Goa came to a halt following a Supreme Court order quashing the second renewal of 88 mining leases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-to-conduct-e-auction-of-iron-ore-on-march-24/articleshow/81539047.cms||---
---||Delhi||AAP to take to Delhi streets over Centre bid to ‘cripple’ govt||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party members led by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will gather at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday to protest against the Centre’s “unconstitutional, illegal and undemocratic” move to “cripple” the elected government of Delhi. AAP unleashed an attack on the central government soon after the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 was tabled in Parliament. It has also received the backing of some opposition parties. The amendment seeks to give greater administrative powers to the Centre through the lieutenant governor and the elected state government would need the approval of the LG for all executive decisions. AAP Delhi convener Gopal Rai said, “The BJP-led central government is once again trying to rob the elected government of Delhi of its powers. BJP lost badly in the assembly elections. Even in the recently concluded municipal bypolls, they got zero seats.” “With the popularity of AAP growing from Delhi to Gujarat, its governance is also being acknowledged and recognised. The central government has conspired to limit the elected government’s powers by attempting to overturn the judgment of a Constitution Bench of Supreme Court. The Bill will affect the functioning of the elected government and obstruct its plans and schemes. Now, every decision will be at the mercy of the LG,” added Rai. Rai further stated, “All AAP MLAs, ministers and the CM will be present at Jantar Mantar from 2pm on Wednesday to protest against the undemocratic decision being taken by the central government.” Sanjay Singh, AAP Rajya Sabha member, has reached out to the functionaries of various opposition parties and some of them are expected to join the protest. RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav hit out at BJP over the introduction of the Bill and said that his party would oppose the move at all levels. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury tweeted: “Defeat this draconian anti-democratic legislation. Negates and insults people’s electoral verdict and mandate. Destroys federalism, a basic feature of our Constitution. Unacceptable.” RLD vice-president Jayant Chaudhary tweeted: “Central government has introduced a Bill in Lok Sabha, Govt of NCT of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021. This seeks to clarify the expression “Government”, which in the context of legislations to be passed by the Delhi assembly shall mean the LG. Why have state elections at all?” Senior Congress functionary Kapil Sibal also termed the Bill “unconstitutional”, which violates the federal structure. Earlier on Tuesday, AAP MPs had protested near the Gandhi statue in the premises of Parliament against the Bill. Sanjay Singh said, “The Modi government doesn’t believe in democratic, federal and constitution framework and tries to oppress elected governments.” “The intention of the Centre behind bringing the Bill is as clear as day. In the past too, attempts were made through MHA orders to restrict the powers of the elected government of Delhi. Every file was routed via the LG’s office, which led to several projects being delayed. Construction of mohalla clinics and installing CCTV cameras was delayed for years. The same situation is arising now, which is worrisome for Delhiites,” added Rai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-to-take-to-streets-over-centre-bid-to-cripple-govt/articleshow/81537618.cms||AlokKNMishra

The garbage here is only increasing. BJP’s own report is exposing its lies. When the garbage at the landfill sites is not reducing, how can the height of landfills reduce?” Pathak asked.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, all three corporations were using trommel machines to reduce the height of garbage dumps at landfill sites effectively. “The corporations are also working on a scheme for faster disposal of garbage by setting up new treatment plants,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-targets-corpns-over-waste-claims/articleshow/81537644.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Speaking to reporters after submitting his nomination in Puthuppally on Tuesday, Chandy said women have been given due representation in the candidates list. The new list will also have women representation, he added. However, KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran chose to talk tough on the issue and alleged a conspiracy by the CPM behind the incident. “Lathika doesn’t deserve to be pardoned for her act,” he said. He also alleged that Lathika had joined hands with the rivals of Congress party and the incident in front of the KPCC office was based on a script. Chandy visited churches at Puthuppally and Manarcad before filing nominations. He told reporters that he has been successful in being the MLA of Puthuppally without a break for over 50 years due to the support of the people in the constituency. He also said that he had wrested the seat from the LDF. "I could improve my winning margin in every elections after that. I am indebted to the people of Puthuppally for this," he said. He also expressed confidence in UDF regaining power this time. "How can the faithful forget Sabarimala issue," he asked. He also said that the devotees are not satisfied with the apologetic statements of Kadakampally Surendran. "It was the LDF government which withdrew the affidavit given in the Supreme Court by the UDF opposing the women entry in Sabarimala, he said.

GMPF raised concerns that their livelihood matter is being ignored by the central government in getting a legislative cure to restart mining activities in the state. It has been three years since mining in Goa came to a halt on March 15, 2018 following the Supreme Court decision to quash the second renewal of 88 mining leases. Puti Gaonkar, president, GMPF, said that the state government, with the backing of all 40 MLAs cutting across party lines, has already proposed a legislative amendment to the Centre to resolve the mining imbroglio in the state. He also said that the matter is currently sub-judice. “The delay from the central government to take a legislative route as a cure in resolving the state’s mining stalemate, which is pending since the past three years, only goes to show the neglect towards the economic welfare of Goa,” Gaonkar said. GMPF had written a letter to chief minister Pramod Sawant demanding resurrection of mining in the state to help generate sustainable and continuous employment and revive the earning opportunities for the mining dependants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mining-front-seeks-monthly-dole-jobs/articleshow/81539069.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police said a letter has been sent to CAPF VIP wing and their response was awaited. “We will record the CAPF personnel’s statement as CCTV footage from Rakesh’s residence showed two of them were in the same car as Rakesh and Amritraj. This will help us establish the conspiracy hatched,” an officer said. “The questioning of CISF personnel will trace Amritraj,” said police. Cops will also record statements of CAPF personnel who accompanied Rakesh to Galsi, from where he was arrested. The questioning of Aryan Dev, a Rakesh aide, led police to decide to record CAPF personnel’ statements. “The CCTV footage only highlighted this necessity,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-to-record-capf-personnel-statements/articleshow/81537666.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

CID said Motewar had purchased the necklace from the money deposited by investors. State CID chief Additional DG Atulchandra Kulkarni told TOI “We have recovered the gold necklace worth around Rs50 lakh from the temple’s trust. It was donated by Motewar to the temple in 2013 using investors’ funds.Further probe is on.” Mahesh Suryavanshi, treasurer of the temple trust, told TOI, “When the CID officials came to the temple with the permission of the Charity Commissioner, we handed over the necklace to them. It was donated to the Lord by Motewar.” Motewar, the CEO of Samruddha Jeevan Foods India, and others were arrested by the state CID in December 2015. He is currently lodged in a jail in Odisha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cid-recovers-rs-50l-necklace-donated-by-scam-accused/articleshow/81537664.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Why fresh tussle could be a body blow for 20,000 guest teachers||NEW DELHI: As the power tussle between Delhi government and the lieutenant governor seems imminent yet again, 20,000 guest teachers working at government schools have lost all hope of being regularised. The appointment of guest teachers in Delhi government schools started in 2010. The decision was supposed to be a stop-gap measure in the absence of regular recruitment, but it continued and these teachers became a part of government schools. In 2015, Aam Aadmi Party had promised regularisation. Teachers allege every time an effort was made to regularise them, it had been withheld by the lieutenant governor’s office. In 2016, the AAP government had passed a proposal to give relaxation to guest teachers on the basis of their experience, exams and age during the recruitment of permanent teachers, but the then LG, Najeeb Jung, had rejected it, stating that the move was unfair to the fresh candidates. Jung only cleared the age relaxation norm, but the recruitment advertisement didn’t include it. In 2017, a special assembly session was called and Regularisation of Services of Guest Teachers and Teachers Engaged under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Bill was passed. But lieutenant governor Anil Baijal turned it down, saying the government did not have control over “services”. A protest by guest teachers followed, prompting a revision of salary. The biggest protest took place in 2019 when teachers came out on the road. The government passed the 60-year retirement policy, which also didn’t get the LG’s nod. “Now if the new central Bill is saying that the LG’s approval is required for every decision, we can’t expect anything,” said 31-year-old Ravinder Chaudhary, a natural science teacher at Government Boys Senior Secondary School, Gokulpur village. “In this power tussle, our lives have been destroyed. It has been four years since our salary has been revised,” said Chaudhary, a guest teacher since 2014. His wife was also working as a guest teacher, but has now got a job at a primary school in Uttar Pradesh. They now have to live separately. “It is difficult to survive in this salary, considering the inflation,” said Chaudhary. Despite belonging to the reserved category, he has just a few years left to sit for the recruitment exam. Another guest teacher said, “For several years, recruitment did not take place and we continued working. Now recruitment is on, but there is so much competition as every year so many people graduate. As we have many years of experience, we should get some relief.” Then there are some like Shoaib Rana, a guest teacher at a northeast Delhi school, who are now on the wrong side of the age eligibility norm. “Regularisation looks like a far-fetched thing now. The government should at least give age relaxation or regularise us like Uttar Pradesh has done. Every time we can’t protest for our demands,” said Rana. The LG’s office could not be reached for comments on the matter. A senior government official said, “We have always tried to work for our teachers who are a major part of the education revolution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-fresh-tussle-could-be-a-body-blow-for-20000-guest-teachers/articleshow/81537658.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Delhi||Delhi HC offers hope to kid hit by rarest of rare disease||NEW DELHI: A five-year-old child suffering from one of the rarest diseases in history – it afflicts only two out of 1.3 billion – has a shot at survival thanks to the intervention of Delhi High Court. Bedridden and on ventilator for 10-12 hours daily, the child’s plight came to light recently when the court was hearing a dispute between the parents. She suffers from biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia, which is one of the rarest afflictions. In a request for financial assistance, the mother, who has the child’s custody, urged the court to intervene. She informed the high court that there is some hope for treatment of her child in the United States, where ameliorative treatment has been given to similar patients that involves multiple operations on the brain, over a period of six months. She, however, added that for medical reasons, it can be performed only upon a person over seven years of age and expenses run into crores of rupees, which she can’t afford. A concerned court then asked the Centre if it can arrange the patient’s transfer and subsequent treatment in the US, since it is the only hope for the child. “As regards the treatment of the child in the US, the court considers it appropriate that the Government of India looks into the matter and considers this rare case for treatment of its most needy citizen,” justice Waziri noted, asking additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma and standing counsel Gaurang Kanth to find out how the government can help and file a response. The court also noted that at present the child is responding well to the care and treatment given to her due to the aid extended by the AAP government on court’s orders to pay Rs 12,000 to a private nurse monthly. “The court is of the view, that looking at the unprecedented nature of affliction and the uniqueness of the case, Delhi government should consider the mother’s request compassionately and supply the requisite medical equipment to her,” HC opined while asking the state government to look into reimbursement or direct payment of the revised and enhanced service charges for the nurse. It will consider both governments’ stand next month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-offers-hope-to-kid-hit-by-rarest-of-rare-disease/articleshow/81537667.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Surat||South Gujarat Univ at mercy of in-charge officers||Surat: Six months have passed since the term of last regular vice-chancellor of Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) had ended and the state government is yet to appoint a successor to the highest post in the varsity that caters to the largest tribal belt of the state. VC Shivendra Gupta’s three-year term ended in August 2020 and currently, the affairs are being run by an in-charge VC, Hemali Desai. Gupta’s term remained controversial and no recruitment had been made on administrative or academic posts then. Various other key posts too are lying vacant for years, including the second most important post in the varsity, pro vice-chancellor, has been vacant for the past three years. The posts of university registrar, chief of administrative staff have been vacant for five years now, while chief librarian, deputy librarian, deputy registrar, chief accounting officer, deputy accountant and two auditors’ posts have not been filled up for years together. The list doesn’t end there. Other important posts like NSS coordinator, deputy director of youth and welfare as well as coaches in different sports have remained unoccupied for long. “Total 70 administrative staff posts are vacant. When university had 30 affiliated colleges we had 300 staff members but now, when the number of affiliated colleges is 300 the regular staff is just 80,” a senior university official told TOI. In a majority of these vacant positions, contractual employees have been working. “The university that serves such a large area should have a regular VC. If the in-charge VC is good, then she should be appointed as regular or any other eligible VC should be appointed. But as per my knowledge, the VC appointment committee is yet to submit the three final names to the government,” said Suryakant Shah, a veteran academician. Those in key bodies of the university are also worried over the delay in appointments. “The university that has 300 affiliated colleges should have a regular VC. We are hopeful of a qualified VC who can promote research work in the university,” said Sanjay Desai, a syndicate member, VNSGU. Saying that the issue will be resolved soon, BJP state president C R Paatil said, “The appointment of a VC got delayed pehaps due tothe polls, but the committee is likely to finalise the names in a few days. I will try and ensure that other important posts too get filled up soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/south-gujarat-univ-at-mercy-of-in-charge-officers/articleshow/81536635.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The wooden roof and plastic material in the vicinity fed the fire, which quickly spread to the shops in the vicinity.Fire tenders from Pune Cantonment Board and Pune Municipal Corporation rushed to the spot. It took them nearly two hours to douse the fire.Vijay Chavan, head of PCB’s electrical department, said a 5,000sqft area of the market was damaged and its wooden roof destroyed in the fire. “We will conduct a joint investigation with the fire brigade and submit a report to the board. We are going to investigate whether the deep-freeze unit exploded due to excessive electric supply or any other reason. Since each shop has its own electric connection, so we need check for faulty wiring,” Chavan said.The market, built in 1885 by the British, is not on the Archeological Society of India’s list of heritage structures, PCB officials said.The cantonment had carried out extensive repairs to the market’s roof in 2008-09. “We had again carried out repairs to the roof and tiles, cleaned the drainage line and painted the structure. In 2014, we had carried out stone masonry work on the market’s facade,” PCB civil engineer Sukhdev Patil said.Vineet Nair, PCB’s officiating CEO, assessed the situation and told TOI that their engineering department would estimate the overall losses. “Based on their report, PCB would prepare restoration plans. It’s a British-era structure and is of historic significance,” he said.Amol Jagtap, director, defence estates of Southern Command, who too visited the site, said, “We have advised the PCB to restore the structure as per the original plan.”Meanwhile, residents of cantonment limits said neither the PCB nor PMC ever made a conscious effort to declare the market a heritage structure.Netraprakash Bhog, advocate and one of the oldest residents of the area, said, “Had it been a listed heritage site, it would have been maintained properly. Its condition had deteriorated over the years. The authorities concerned should now try to list it as a heritage structure so that future generations can experience its history,” Bhog said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/massive-blaze-destroys-25-shops-in-british-era-shivaji-market-in-camp/articleshow/81537662.cms||Sandip Dighe

TOI has found cars and bikes parked one after another on such cycle lanes. One such spot is the stretch beside ‘Swapno Bhor’ and New Town Mela ground where cars and bikes have been lined up on cycle lanes. Cycle enthusiasts said that they were finding it tough to make people understand not to park cars on cycle lanes. “This has become a problem. We are trying to build up awareness on the matter,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town Forum and News (NTFN), a local NGO. The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has noticed the problem and is taking up an awareness campaign. “This is a rising problem which has been noticed. We have not yet involved the police in this matter and are trying to build up awareness on our own, urging motorists not to park their vehicles on the cycle lanes. A few preventive measures are being taken up,” said an NKDA official. Officials said that they have already started placing bollards beside the demarcated cycle lanes through which cycles will be able to pass but cars and bikes will get blocked. One such stretch is the cycle lane at CC Block in Action Area I.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cars-and-bikes-parked-on-cycle-lanes-in-new-town/articleshow/81537660.cms||Suman Chakraborti

In an interview to an online news portal run by a vernacular daily, Balasankar claimed that the distorted outlook of state BJP leadership was the reason for denial of Chengannur assembly seat to him. If the saffron party chooses to go ahead with the current leadership, political victory would elude the party for another 30 years, he said. Balasankar, purportedly with the consent of BJP central leadership, had been camping at Chengannur for some time now, building and brushing up his connections with community and religious leaders. Meanwhile, BJP state president K Surendran said he was unaware about Balasankar’s claim that he was promised Chengannur seat. “I didn’t know he was expecting a seat. His other comments and claims don’t deserve any reply,” Surendran said in a cryptic reply when television channels sought his reaction on Balasankar’s claims. The RSS ideologue has reportedly told some television and online media that he was denied the assembly seat as part of an underhand deal the BJP leaders in the state had struck with CPM. Balasankar claimed that NSS, SNDP and a Christian church have promised him support in Chengannur, which is also his native town. Balasankar was also quoted as speaking ill of Surendran using helicopter for electioneering. “It’s the same leader who criticized Kerala chief minister for travelling by helicopter is now using a helicopter to travel between two seats he contests from. People in Kerala don't like such extravaganza,” he reportedly said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bjp-state-leadership-working-like-mafia-says-rss-ideologue/articleshow/81539115.cms||---

Senior inspector Bhaskar Jadhav of the Talegaon Dabhade police said, “The arrested — Harshal Ashok Surve, Pradeep Pandurang Hande, Vijay Subhas Darwan, Devendra Nandkumar Sawant and Ashish Chandrashekhar Ashtekar — from Kolhapur are members of Shiv Durga Samvardhan Sanghatana, an organisation that works for the conservation of forts in western Maharashtra.” The protest was staged between 5pm and 5.30pm, barely a week before the three-match ODI series between India and England starts at the Gahunje stadium from March 23. The five stick-wielding men threatened the stadium’s guards while entering the facility and raised slogans demanding the return of the sword. Deepak Munde (28), one of the security guards, later lodged a complaint with the police.

---||Delhi||DU dept unearths settlement on highway site, may date back to 6th-7th century BC||NEW DELHI: On March 2, professor Manoj Kumar Singh from Delhi University’s department of anthropology got an email from a student in Lucknow about a few artifacts being found in Umra village in Sultanpur district. After assessment and excavation, a team of researchers has likely discovered a human settlement from 6th to 7th century BCE. Based on the terracotta structures, charred foodgrains, animal bones and pottery, an archaeologist from Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) reached the conclusion that the settlement could have been a part of the ancient trade route towards Allahabad. Lucknow student, Kartik Mani Tripathi, discovered the ancient remains on land that was dug up for an Uttar Pradesh government-sponsored highway project. “Kartik sent mails to many authorities, including ASI, but got no response. He then emailed me on March 2. The next day, two of my researchers, Sudeshna Biswas and Ravinder, reached the spot,” said Singh. Biswas said the site was in a hamlet called Jawahar ka Purwa. “We found remains of pottery, potsherds, grains, bricks and bones and reported it to our professor. He then led an immediate preliminary investigation of the unreported remains. The site, located on a raised platform close to Gomti river, might have been a permanent settlement,” she added. Singh said locals called the place “Itawah”, or locale of bricks. “The villagers had found mounds of large unusual bricks. They had used mud, potsherds and other precious debris and bricks to build their houses. The bricks were huge and heavy compared with contemporary ones. Due to their longevity, almost every house in the area had used them,” he added. The researchers also found a cylinder and arch-type brick structure approximately 10 feet deep with layers of ashes. “The potsherds were of various designs and had been stylised with concentric circles, fishnet wavy patterns, circles, and geometric as well as non-geometric designs. The exploration yielded a variety of raw materials, predominantly red ware. The other relatively scarce sherds were of black ware and polished black ware,” said Biswas. Bhuvan Vikram, superintendent archeologist with ASI, told TOI, “The photographs of the potsherds clearly show that they are of the northern black polished ware culture, which was prevalent in the first millennia BCE. We can safely say that the site belongs to around the 7th Century BCE in the Kushana period.” “The entire region is rich in history, This was also the period when Buddha was travelling. In those times, cities were flourishing. This could be the part of a trade route, which makes it significant. We hope to find more such sites,” added Vikram. The charred remains of mustard, paddy, etc made it appear to the researchers that grains were stacked or stored in the area and food had been cooked there. In his letter to ASI director general V Vidyavathi, the professor stated that the site could be an epitome of new findings in the field of archaeology and ancient history. However, he warned that due to the quarrying for the highway, ASI should look into the matter at the earliest to stop further destruction of the site. Singh told TOI that he hoped that DU would lead the excavation with assistance from ASI.

On Tuesday, officers from Champawat district and Nepal’s Kanchapur held a joint inspection of the area following the complaints that a few Nepalese people were involved in construction work in the no man’s land. On Monday, after receiving inputs that a few Nepalese people were trying to dig a pit, a Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) team visited the spot and stopped the construction work, said Tanakpur SDM Himanshu Kafaltiya. “On Tuesday, Nepalese and Indian officers jointly inspected the location, and Indian officers told their Nepalese counterparts not to go ahead with any construction work and maintain the status quo. The Nepalese officers assured us that no work would be done,” said the SDM. “The missing border pillars have been creating some problems in the Baramdev area. Besides, a few pillars have been damaged or are in very poor condition. A joint survey of the Indo-Nepal border from Lakhimpur Kheri district to Tanakpur was schedule the last year, but could not be conducted due to the novel coronavirus pandemic,” said the SDM, adding that they hope it will be conducted soon. “The problem will be solved once the missing pillars are erected again,” said the SDM, adding that they have asked the Nepalese officers to maintain the status quo till then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/champawat-admin-ask-nepalese-counterparts-to-stop-construction-work-in-no-mans-land-in-baramdev-area/articleshow/81617584.cms||Prem Punetha
---||Kolkata||Jogen canvas with message on women’s rights up for auction||KOLKATA: One of the biggest canvases that artist Jogen Chowdhury painted about eight years ago to send a social message on women’s rights will go up for auction in Mumbai on March 30-31.  The painting, which was done at the painter’s residence in Santiniketan and was titled ‘Story of a Woman’, is valued at Rs 4.5 crore. The auction will also see paintings of Tagore and Gaganendranath, both national treasures, which can be auctioned but cannot be taken out of India. Chowdhury’s painting, is a large canvas split into five parts that display different moods of a woman as she faces the various realities of life. It shows her happiness when loved and treated as an equal; but men often force themselves upon her and she is sexually violated. The canvases are named, ‘Love making’, ‘Submission’, ‘Romance’, ‘Friendship’ and ‘Aggression’.  The length of the painting is 25 feet and the painter has used acrylic on canvas to portray the images in his characteristic style, popularly called the “Jo” style of imagery. “I have always tried to mix symbolism with realism in my paintings and perhaps, this is the biggest canvas I have painted. The reason for its mammoth size is the message that I wanted to give loud and clear. Women’s sexuality is often not respected but times are changing,” Chowdhury said from Delhi. The Tagore painting is an untitled face, which is ink on paper, and is priced at Rs 30 lakh, while the Gaganendranath Tagore painting is an iconic ‘Metamorphosis’ grouped under his Swadeshi paintings. It is priced at Rs 10 lakh. “Jogen Chowdhury is one of India’s leading modernists. The canvas put up for auction chronicles the life and emotions of a woman in different relationships,” said Tushar Sethi, CEO of AstaGuru, which has organised the auction. Chowdhury said this canvas would remain one of his most-loved works because of the message. “I realise an important duty in the life of an artist is to spread social messages through aesthetics,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jogen-canvas-with-message-on-womens-rights-up-for-auction/articleshow/81537748.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Kolkata||West Bengal assembly elections: Role change for local-level party workers||KOLKATA: With assembly polls still a few days away, the average party workers in Kolkata are already in election mode. Whether it is from the Trinamool Congress, the BJP or CPM, the booth-level workers have been set a number of tasks, several of them meant to collect information and influence voters on the ground. “The city will go to polls after about 40 days, but this is the time to step up the mass contact. They will vote at the last phases of this election and there is a scope that they might take a last moment decision. It is important that we develop a rapport with them,” said a vote manager from Trinamool. Almost all major parties are depending on experts to guide them — from mapping areas which will need attention, state and national issues that need to be highlighted to even the localized agendas which will differ from a slum to a high-rise. “Despite Covid situation and use of tech platform, the one-to one dialogues still count the most,” said Ratna Dutta, a CPM state committee member. The first to have declared all candidates in Kolkata is Trinamool Congress. It has brought a few fresh faces and TMC is determined to reap the advantage of the fact that they have hit the campaign trail at the earliest. “We are attending the workers’ meeting where we are being repeatedly told to work hand-in-hand. We have been asked to visit each household at least thrice and converse with voters for their feedback. It will be crucial to frame our responses as polling nears,” said Ward 83 youth TMC president Debajyoti Basu. But the TMC is going much beyond the mandatory booth meetings. Whatsapp groups have been created at the booth level for TMC. The WhatsApp coordinators of each booth have been clubbed into WhatsApp groups under each ward. A centrally constituted ‘Assembly WhatsApp group’, too, has been formed with ward coordinators. At Behala West, even as the TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee is yet to release the manifesto, booth workers have reached out with a performance card of their candidate Partha Chatterjee, the education minister of Bengal. Besides reforms in education, it has highlighted all the “achievements” of Chatterjee as the MLA from 2001. The CPM, said Dutta, has completed the booth level meetings. “There are several things unique to this election — from using parody songs to using photographs of candidates in festoons — we are trying to evolve with the times. The number of young candidates in fray is part of a conscious decision to change with the times,” said Dutta. BJP workers are not losing sleep over the fact that names of candidates in key constituencies are still awaited. “There is still time and we have been in touch with voters throughout the year.

---||Pune||Two in net for kidnapping, murdering land dealer||Pune: The Pimpri Chinchwad police on Tuesday claimed to have solved kidnapping-cum-murder of Vijay Sarjerao Surve (40), a land dealer from Mohannagar in Chinchwad, whose body was found at Mulshi under the Paud police station in rural Pune on March 10 following the arrest of two suspects. Surve was also a former shakha pramukh of Shiv Sena. The arrested duo — Harshad Ashok Rathod and Mohammad Iqbal Idrisi — were produced before a magisterial court, which ordered their remand in police custody till March 19. Prima facie, Surve’s inability to pay Rs18-20 lakh dues from cricket betting deals to Rathod has been established as the motive behind the murder, police said. The Paud police had registered a case of murder after Surve’s body was found in Mulshi. Based on CCTV footage and dumb data evidence, the Paud police first arrested Rathod on March 11 and his questioning revealed that Surve was murdered at Thergaon. The rural police then transferred the case to Pimpri Chinchwad police for further investigation and Idrisi, a driver, was arrested on March 14. Idrisi, who was in need of money, assisted Rathod in the crime after they called Surve to Thergaon on the pretext of showing him a piece of land, police said. They allegedly bludgeoned Surve with a blunt object and strangulated him to death. Later, they disposed of his body at Mulshi, police said. Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said “Rathod, who also runs a pharmacy shop, and Idrisi killed Surve on an open plot at Thergaon, packed his body in their car, drove to a ghat section in Mulshi village and threw the body into the bushes.” Prakash said “Surve owed about Rs18 to 20lakh to Rathod. He lost money to Rathod in cricket betting and was not in a position to return the money and this enraged Rathod. A few days before the murder, Idrisi, who works as a tourist cab driver, approached Rathod for financial help of Rs 20,000. Rathod asked Idrisi to help him in threatening Surve and Idrisi agreed.” “Instead of threatening Surve, they killed him with a heavy and blunt object and strangled him,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-in-net-for-kidnapping-murdering-land-dealer/articleshow/81537684.cms||---

The rivals of LDF have big concerns over the added mass support to the government. “Now, they are trying to create certain kind of symbols for limiting the discussions to such issues. Congress tries to give a message that contest in Nemom is the party’s trump card in its fight against BJP. The Congress should first make it clear that where have their votes gone in the previous election in Nemom. Now, they (the Congress) say they have fielded a strong person in Nemom. It will take quite some time to know whether the Congress is sincere in its fight against BJP in Nemom,” the CM told a news conference in Kannur on Tuesday. He said that to prove the party’s sincerity in this regard, the party should retrieve the votes that had gone to the BJP in the previous election. “Both the BJP and the Congress are helping each other. Leaders of one party will raise a particular allegation against the LDF government in the morning and the leaders of the other party will raise the same allegation in the evening,” he added. They are engaged in the campaigns to malign the LDF government. “One of the campaigns was that the PSC is not giving appointment to the rank-holders. In the past five years, the PSC gave placement for 1,58,000 persons. It is an all-time record. At the same time, the central government is not filling around 8 lakh vacancies,” the CM said. Another allegation is that the food kit given in the state is being given by the Centre. “If so, why is food kit distribution system not there in the BJP-ruled states?” he asked. “People in many states voted out BJP and elected Congress. But the elected Congress legislators sabotaged the people’s mandate and sold themselves out to the BJP. When these MLAs were in Congress, they were opposing CAA. Now, they have to support CAA. This attitude has put the credibility Congress at stake,” Vijayan said. On the Congress leadership’s comment that Lathika Subhash’s protest was stage-managed by the CPM, the CM said that he has doubts whether it was a mature comment on the part of political leaders. “In the past five years, the LDF government was with the people. The mass participation of people in the election campaign in Dharmadom, especially women, shows that the people are with the LDF,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bjp-buying-democracy-cong-put-up-for-sale/articleshow/81539156.cms||---
---||Delhi||New museum at Lahori Gate to showcase heritage of old Delhi||NEW DELHI: With several infrastructure projects being planned to rejuvenate the Walled City, North Delhi Municipal Corporation is going ahead with its project to develop a museum and interpretation centre of Shahjahanabad. A haveli, which was built in 1929, will house the centre to showcase the heritage of old Delhi. Bids have been received for phase-I of the project in which civil and maintenance work at the heritage haveli at Lahori Gate is to be carried out. The first phase is likely to cost Rs 55.7 lakh while the overall project is estimated to cost Rs 4.2 crore as per a detailed report prepared by Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach). Though the red and yellow-coloured two-storey heritage structure, which provides glimpses of the old glory of Chandni Chowk, was restored in 2004, but it is currently in a neglected and dilapidated condition. The haveli’s premises lies encroached and sections of its roof and jharokha keep crumbling. A senior municipal official said that the centre, which is near Khari Baoli and Naya Bazar, would help visitors understand the history, evolution and period-wise development of Shahjahanabad. It will also act as an interpretation centre for living heritage spaces like kunchas and katras, he added. “It will provide a platform to support artisans as well. Artists and craftsmen will be able to showcase their products in galleries.” The haveli located on Vasudev Captain Chowk— an intersection of Khari Baoli, Swami Sharaddhanand Marg (GB Road) and Naya Bazar— is a municipal property and a one-room dispensary used to function here before 2003. The restored structure was inaugurated in 2004. It will now be used to present a cultural cross-section of Shahjahanabad, which was founded by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in the mid-17th century. The Mughal empire was at the height of its prosperity then. The museum will house artefacts, crafts, narrative panels, digital databases and audio-visual tools as a repository of Shahjahnabad’s story. Specific galleries have been planned to house the model of the city to highlight the evolution of the town plan, digital reconstruction of historic structures like clock tower and dioramas to bring to life scenes from the past. The Intach report proposes that the centre tour will initiate with the Shahjahanabad gallery, which will have a model of Shahjahanabad and display panels explaining its evolutions through the centuries. “This room will also be used for lectures and workshops,” the report states. The second gallery on the ground floor will be based on the theme of “History of Delhi” and it will have display panels depicting the Delhi of ancient times, along with a timeline and an interactive map on a touchscreen to help visitors virtually explore several heritage sites of the capital. “The ground floor will have two more permanent exhibitions on Mughal period and current community culture, language, food and customs of Shahjahanabad. The galleries on the first floor will focus on trade and crafts as well as dioramas depicting scenes from the civic life of historic times such as scenes of a haveli courtyard, kite flying and pigeon flying,” the report details. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said that they have set a target of 6-12 months for completion of the repair work and the haveli’s transformation as a mini-tourist centre. “Around two decades ago, former Union minister Vijay Goel had attempted to set a museum here and the process is now being revived in a new avatar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-museum-at-lahori-gate-to-showcase-heritage-of-old-delhi/articleshow/81537692.cms||Paras Singh

The survivor delivered a boy at a hospital in Pimpri on January 5, 2017, and had to be treated in the intensive care unit after suffering post-delivery fits. Special judge A V Rotte relied on the survivor’s testimony and medical evidence, including the girl and the child’s DNA and chemical analyser reports, while convicting the man for offences under Section 376 (2) of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with repeated rape of minor girl, and Section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, which refers to aggravated sexual assault. The DNA report established the survivor and the accused were biological parents of the baby. The court also sentenced the accused to two years’ rigorous imprisonment and imposed Rs25,000 fine on the accused. The incident came to light in December 2016 when the girl became pregnant and narrated her woes to her grandmother. After the girl delivered a child and was treated for fits, she recorded her statement with the police on January 11, 2017, following which the accused was arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-gets-life-term-for-raping-minor-impregnating-her/articleshow/81537725.cms||Vishwas Kothari

---||Goa||Surplus supply sees retail onion prices drop to Rs 35/kg||Panaji: After being sold at Rs 55-60 per kg until last month, onion prices have come down to Rs 35 per kg in the retail market. Suppliers of the pink bulbs have attributed the reason for the same to a rise in production in the neighbouring states. The onion prices are expected to further decrease in the coming weeks owing to the surplus supply. “The prices usually lower during winter, but it was unfortunately higher for a month or so. With the harvest of the new crop, the rates are coming down. Next week onwards, onions from Nashik will also hit the market and assuming there is a bumper produce, prices may go down further,” Veenit Bichu, a vegetable supplier from Belagavi told TOI. Prices of the bulbs at the state-run horticulture outlets were selling at Rs 29 per kg on Tuesday. “Besides the new stock of onion coming into the market, traders exporting onion have diverted some of their contingent to be supplied locally,” GSHCL managing director, Sandeep Faldesai said. With the increase of onion stock, vendors in the state are now able to normalise the rates. “Besides the shortage of onions, the recent unseasonal showers and resultant humidity were leading to spoilage. Now the quality of onions is also very good. In a few days, we won’t even have an issue giving out the smaller sized bulbs for Rs 25 per kg,” said onion seller Asif Pathan. Vegetable vendors in the Panaji market are all smiles after the consumer pattern has fallen back to normalcy. “Customers would otherwise pinch their pockets and purchase smaller quantities of onion to manage their budget. Now, they are back to buying their regular amount of five to ten kgs at a time,” said vendor, Jafar Mokashi. “The past month was especially very tough. It’s a relief that we can purchase the onions well within our budget now, but it would be better if prices fall further,” Sanjay Jhadav, a businessman from Panaji said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/surplus-supply-sees-retail-onion-prices-drop-to-rs-35/kg/articleshow/81539215.cms||Nida Sayed

He said though he was not keen on contesting the assembly election, he agreed as his party wanted him to do so. “There were four options and the Prime Minister asked me to contest from Thrissur,” Gopi said. The actor who is recovering from pneumonia said he would start campaigning after taking the Covid-19 vaccine. “I will have to recover first. I will study the issues and understand the reality, meanwhile,” he added. On how he looked at chances of a win, the BJP candidate said, “It’s not about winning. It’s about putting up a tough fight. How can anyone predict a win so soon? When I contested for Lok Sabha the previous time there were seven constituencies. This time there is only one which has 41 divisions. It will not be easy because there is a vast difference between a Lok sabha, local body and assembly polls.” Commenting on Lathika Subhash’s tonsuring protest, Gopi said it pained him. “With this, it has become very clear that no MP from Kerala has the right to talk about 33% reservation for women as all political parties in the state have failed to do justice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/suresh-gopito-commencecampaign-soon/articleshow/81539185.cms||---

The special NDPS court had on December 2, 2020 granted bail to Showik. The NCB said the bail order was granted “by ignoring the findings and observations made by the HC, under special statute, while rejecting the bail application.” The HC had last October rejected Showik’s bail plea while allowing his sister’s. The NCB said Showik has been granted bail “despite findings of involvement’’ and his “links” with other drug peddlers and it needs to be set aside and his custody restored. It also said his post-bail conduct is “not conducive for further investigations or a fair trial”.

---||Nagpur||Day of records: Highest cases, highest tests ever in Vidarbha||Nagpur: The second fortnight of March began with a never before surge in the number of new Covid cases in Vidarbha. For the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic, 5,113 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours. The foremost reason for the sudden spike is no doubt the increase in the number of tests. In the last 24 hours, 11 districts in the region conducted 36,779 tests which is also a record. Nagpur conducted 13,364 tests in the last 24 hours with 2,587 testing positive. About 20% of the samples tested positive in the district, which is still a major cause for concern. Apart from Nagpur, the top five districts in terms of tests were Yavatmal (5,027), Amravati (3,578), Buldhana (2,831), Chandrapur (2,495) and Akola(1,711). With 3,309 patients recovering in a day, Vidarbha now has more than 3.33 lakh recovered patients out of 3.8 lakh cases. The recovery rate is 87.5% which is constantly going down due to more cases and fewer recoveries, a common trend since the last few days. The region reported 39 deaths on Tuesday. Nagpur district alone accounted for 18. Out of the deceased in Nagpur, 12 are from Nagpur city, 4 from Nagpur rural and 2 from other districts/states. Yavatmal district reported 8 deaths in a day, Wardha, Akola and Amravati 3 each while Chandrapur and Buldhana 2 apiece. Now, Vidarbha’s total death toll is 7,832, almost 2% of the total cases. The case fatality rate of Vidarbha is almost equal to the state average but way higher than national. At 39, the death toll was highest in the last three months. The number of under-treatment patients also broke all records on Tuesday. Now, 39,581 patients are under treatment in Vidarbha. Still, there is no crunch of beds in hospitals in most of the districts. This is because more than 80% patients are recovering in home isolation. Less hospitalization hints less severe form of disease which is a major relief for the region. Akola: The district reported 391 new cases, 423 recoveries and 3 deaths on Tuesday. The deceased include a 46-year-old woman, a 65-year-old woman and a 55-year-old man. The total toll of Akola reached 407. Out of 22,238 cases, 16,770 have recovered. Still, 5,061 patients are under treatment, which is second highest in Vidarbha after Nagpur’s 18,980. Buldhana: Two women, a 65-year-old and a 75-year-old, died during treatment in Buldhana on Tuesday. This took the death toll of the district to 222. With 567 new cases and 514 recoveries on Tuesday, the district now has 26,230 total cases and 23,379 recoveries. Still, 3,629 patients are under treatment.

The court said that the application should be processed after calling for reports from the the officer in charge of maintenance of law and order in Kanyakumari district.Permission was rejected by the district collector after obtaining reports from the sub-collector and the superintendent of police who had concluded that granting permission to the petitioner to conduct prayers towards promotion of his faith would affect public peace and would also pose law and order problems.Challenging the rejection order, the petitioner had filed the present petition.Justice V Parthiban observed that when peaceful religious activities could be carried on without affecting public order and peace, the same cannot be prohibited for an indefinite period of time citing the Mandaikadu communal riots which took place as early in 1982. Admittedly, there has been no riot or any communal clashes in the area, since 1982.“This fact would demonstrate that people in the district following different faiths have been maintaining cordiality, not succumbing to and falling prey to machination or subterfuge of certain vested interests,” observed the judge.Quoting Albert Camus, a great 20th Century French writer, ‘Democracy is not the law of the majority, but the protection of minority’, the judge observed that it is for the administrators to take a comprehensive decision in such sensitive matters and at the same time, the petitioner cannot be denied his right to carry on his legitimate religious worship of his faith.“A delicate balance may have to be maintained as between the public order and peace on one hand and citizens’ fundamental right to worship and propagate their faith in tune with the Constitutional scheme,” observed the judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-directs-to-process-plea-to-conduct-prayers-after-consulations/articleshow/81539219.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Madurai||HC seeks CBI response on NEET malpractices in other states||MADURAI: The Madras high court has sought a response from the CBI as to whether NEET impersonations were reported in other states, after taking into account that a large-scale conspiracy was hatched among several people from other states. The court was hearing the bail petition filed by Rasheed, a middleman who was arrested in connection with a NEET impersonation case by the Theni CB-CID police. The CB-CID deputy superintendent of police who appeared before the court submitted that they have collected various documents and also sent instructions to the colleges to find out the impersonators. He further submitted that they had also sent a letter to UIDAI seeking for comparison of the photos and also the fingerprint. Justice M Nirmal Kumar observed that the court finds that other than Tamil Nadu, such malpractices were not reported in any other states. The apprehension is that the same modus operandi was adopted in other states, but has not been reported. The judge said that the CB-CID officials concentrated only on students who had been admitted in Tamil Nadu. However, there is no cooperation on the side of UIDAI and from the director of medical education and other stakeholders. The judge said that the students involved in such malpractices deny the seats for bright students in getting medical seats. To prevent such malpractices, judge Suo Motu impleaded the Madurai district superintendent of police of CBI - anti-corruption branch and sought a response as to whether such malpractices were reported in other states. The counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner had already been granted statutory bail by the trial court and hence, he seeks permission from this court to withdraw this petition. The petition has been kept pending and adjourned to March 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-seeks-cbi-response-on-neet-malpractices-in-other-states/articleshow/81545854.cms||Kaushik Kannan

As for the gang of thieves, the laborious exercise of going through each closed classroom delivered them a life’s learning that education is rich, but experience is priceless! The school, however, didn’t let them go out empty handed — it gave them a ‘scholarship’ for all their hard work — Rs60! They chose to target Vivekanand School for stealing and scrambled from room to room through the night to lay their hands finally on the measly reward notes, said police, adding that the thieves entered at around 11pm on Monday night and stayed there till early Tuesday morning. “The thieves with faces covered ransacked the classrooms systematically breaking locks of rooms that were closed in the hope of finding something valuable,” said an official of Gondal police station Tired of all the hard work, they sniffed some luck when they could enter the accountant's room, but the drawer contained the invaluable lesson of their lives in the form of few notes, probably of Rs 10 each, amounting to Rs60 in all. Police said that two days ago, a gang of thieves had broken into five shops in the town. However, there too the exercise went in vain as they couldn’t find much valuables. A complaint was lodged by a shop owner Vijay Movaiya. Cops are now trying to ascertain if these were the same people who entered the school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/thieves-break-into-school-come-out-with-rs-60-booty/articleshow/81536678.cms||---

The entry of Dr P Saravanan, who was DMK’s Thiruparankundram MLA, to BJP and his securing a poll ticket within hours had created much heartburn among BJP cadres leading to an open protest. Introducing the candidate to the media, Singh said any dissatisfaction among cadres due to Saravanan’s candidature had been resolved and they would work unitedly. Asked if he was denied the seat by DMK because they came to know that he was in talks with BJP, Saravanan said MLAs in DMK did not have the freedom to do what they wanted for their people. BJP national secretary Dr R Srinivasan, who was expected to be fielded from the seat, said there was no confusion over Saravanan’s candidature as the party high command had earlier consulted him. Answering a question on the AIADMK promising to ask the Centre to withdraw the CAA, Singh said that it would be settled once the concerned parties sat down and discussed. ``The problem is that the CAA, which provides security to minorities from India in other countries, had been misinterpreted,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/saravanan-has-good-prospects-says-bjp/articleshow/81539231.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala assembly polls: BJP may announce its candidates today||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP would field its state vice-president Sobha Surendran in Kazhakoottam where Union minister V Muraleedharan had finished second in the previous assembly election. Party’s parliamentary board is learned to have taken a final decision regarding Sobha’s candidature, which had been hanging in balance for past few days. According to sources close to Sobha, BJP parliamentary board cleared Sobha’s name for Kazhakoottam on Tuesday and the information was passed on to her by BJP national president J P Nadda. Sobha has been given the Kazhakoottam seat against the wishes and preferences of BJP state leadership. Sobha who has of late become a critic of state president K Surendran had earlier informed the state and national leadership that she may be spared from contesting polls this time for personal reasons. However, she also gave signals that she would not say no if the central leadership wanted her to fight from Kazhakoottam, the sitting constituency of devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran. Sobha had openly expressed her willingness to contest in Kazhakuttom on Monday. Sources said the central leadership was actively considered Sobha for Kazhakutttom even before the first list of candidates were announced on Sunday. But, since she gave contradictory answers to different leaders in the parliamentary board, the leadership decided to drop her name from the final list. However, the Lathika Subhash episode prompted the BJP central leadership to consider Sobha’s name once again for Kazhakuttom constituency even against the wishes of BJP state leadership. Meanwhile, there were attempts to field BDJS president and SNDP leader Thushar Vellappally in Kazhakuttom constituency. But Thushar did not yield to such demands and stuck to his decision of keeping off from any seats this time. BJP parliamentary board is expected to announce candidates for Kazhakoottam, Kollam and Karunagappally on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bjp-may-announce-its-candidates-today/articleshow/81539247.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Cop arrested for accident, abuse||Hyderabad: An Intelligence Security Wing (ISW) head constable was arrested for causing a non-fatal accident while riding a bike in an inebriated condition and abusing people who confronted him at Meerpet on Monday night. At 8.45pm on Monday, P Chandra Shekar, 49, a teacher of ZPH School, in Saheb Nagar, lodged a complaint with Meerpet police stating that when he was travelling on a scooter with his daughter P Saramu, 14, from a school in Omkar Nagar to their house, a bike rammed their vehicle at Hanuman Temple in Teacher’s colony from the rear. “After the collision, my daughter and I fell from the scooter and she suffered a minor injury. The scooter was also damaged. Locals stopped the biker, Srinivas, but he abused them using filthy language,” the complainant alleged. Suspecting that Srinivas, who claimed to be a cop, was under the influence of alcohol, locals alerted police and Srinivas along with the victims were taken to Meerpet PS. “Even at the police station, Srinivas created nuisance. We subjected Srinivas to breathalyser test and his BAC reading was 200 ml/100 mg, clearly indicating that he was drunk,” an inspector said. Police booked a case against the constable under the Sections 337, 308 of the IPC & 185 of the MV Act. He was arrested and sent to judicial remand on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cop-arrested-for-accident-abuse/articleshow/81539232.cms||---
---||Madurai||6 policemen injured in clashes near Melur||Madurai: Six police personnel were injured when clashes broke out between a police team and villagers near Melur in Madurai district on Monday night over removing a statue. Police sources said that villagers of Vellalapatti near Kottampatti had installed a Thevar statue recently. A police team from Melur and Kottampatti held talks with the villagers to remove the statue. When the villagers refused, the police team tried to remove it by force. The villagers were obstinate. They gathered in large numbers resulting in the building up of tension. They threw stones and logs at the police team, but were chased away. In the melee which lasted for about a few minutes, Oomachikulam deputy superintendent of police Vijayakumar, Kottampatti sub-inspector Sudhan and four policemen from the reserve battalion suffered injuries. They were treated in a hospital. Four police vehicles and an ambulance were damaged. A police officer said higher officials had instructed them to remove the statue since the election model code of conduct was in force. “We tried to pacify villagers by engaging in talks, but some of the unruly villagers took the law into their own hands. As a result, clashes became inevitable,” the officer said. “People from many villages in Madurai district are planning to install new statues of their leaders. If this statue was not removed, others would start questioning the police and they would also try to install statues without permission, resulting in communal tension,” he added. The Kottampatti police registered a case against 31 people under various sections of the IPC, including Section 307 (attempt to murder), and the Tamil Nadu Property Prevention of Damage and Loss Act. They arrested 15 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/6-policemen-injured-in-clashes-near-melur/articleshow/81539252.cms||---
---||Bhopal||City Unmasked As Cases Surge||Bhopal: With a surge in Covid-19 positive cases in the last week, the wheel has come full circle. After a lull of two months, active cases are up to 1,066 in the state capital. All efforts of state government and district administration to ensure people follow Covid protocol seems to have fallen on deaf ears. TOI looks at the various hubs in the city for a reality check. MP Nagar, the commercial centre of Bhopal, has a variety of establishments, banks, hotels, restaurants, malls, showrooms, shops, coaching classes, garages and what not. And, the variety in degree of Covid-19 protocol observance is no less either. There are no-holds-barred shops and small restaurants, where nobody cares for the Covid-19 protocol to hotels, restaurants and showrooms, where thermal screening and sanitization is mandatory. But, strangely, even at places where these precautions are being observed, use of mask is not something that is being strictly enforced. “We have not been told to not allow visitors without masks. We check their body temperature and ask them to sanitise their hands. Wearing mask is their responsibility,” said a guard on the gate of a big hotel in MP Nagar. There are several banks in MP Nagar and as far as TOI could see, none of the banks were enforcing any of the Covid-19. It was quite different a scene compared to lockdown times, when the banks had opened after closure of several days. “We had given up doing all that few months ago. Sanitiser is on the stand, which customers use if they feel like. Otherwise, we are not enforcing any of the protocols,” said a guard outside a private bank in MP Nagar Zone-1. But, there are showrooms and shopping malls, where thermal screening and use of sanitisers is a must for entry, but use of mask is still voluntary. In the smaller shops, which are there in all variety at MP Nagar, selling grocery to snacks to paints, hardware and many more, it’s free for all. Coaching institutes in MP Nagar that were most sought after by students are virtually deserted. Despite district administration permission to run coaching classes with half the capacity, students are preferring online mode. At a coaching centre, a front office staff herself was not wearing mask. There are umpteen hostels also in MP Nagar, but they are all closed. Compared to M P Nagar, New Market is a more compact market and attracts more crowd, at least it seems so because of busy lanes and bylanes of the market. And, even as Covid-19 cases surge in the city, hundreds of people can be seen roaming without masks and social distancing norms. Although most of the shopkeepers were wearing masks, many of them wore it improperly and could be seen talking to customers. Many customers, who were wearing masks, removed it to talk without realising that it may expose them to risks. Market areas in the Old Bhopal seem to suggest that people in the area, who were the first to face the surge of Coronavirus and consequent restrictions, believe that they have developed “herd” immunity against Coronavirus and they need not fear the deadly virus anymore. Every time one goes to Old City areas, he comes back marvelling how people could be so “reckless”. In these areas, mask is a rarity and unmasked a rule. During a visit from Moti Masjid to Budhwara and Lakherapura, Chowk market, TOI found that barring a few, most of the shopkeepers and their employees were sitting at their respective shops without wearing masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/city-unmasked-as-cases-surge/articleshow/81536698.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

The girl, who identified herself to be a student of Class VII from Agra’ Bah area, purportedly stated in a recorded video message: “My father has fixed my wedding with a 40-year-old man, but I don’t want to get married. I want to pursue my studies.” She alleged that a few days ago, her father and his henchmen had assaulted her, her mother and her brother for objecting to the marriage. “If I don’t get justice, I will commit suicide,” threatened the girl, urging the SSP to get her wedding cancelled. Meanwhile, the girl’s brother, a student of class XII, said, “My father is unnecessarily forcing her. When we oppose, he threatens to kill us. I just want my sister to complete her studies.” Their mother also alleged that her husband wants to “sell” their daughter to a person who is more than even twice her age. “My children and I have left our house and have come to my father’s place as my husband is a threat to our lives,” she said. Agra SP (east) K Venkat Ashok told TOI that taking cognisance of the video, a police team was sent to their house to probe the matter. He said that legal action will be taken after the investigation. On the basis of a complaint, a First Information Report (FIR) has been registered against the girl’s father for subjecting her to cruelty, he added. According to police, the girl’s father worked as a labourer in Noida before lockdown but he now lives in the village and works there. He allegedly assaulted his wife after a heated argument over some issue, after which, she moved to her father’s residence with the children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/schoolgirl-15-urges-ssp-to-stop-her-wedding-with-a-40-yr-old-man-fir-lodged/articleshow/81536704.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Active caseload in Bhopal crosses 1,000 mark after 7 weeks||BHOPAL: The number of people under treatment for Covid-19 rose to 1,066 in the state capital on Tuesday. For a little over seven weeks, active cases in the state capital had remained under the 1,000-mark. At present, the Covid-19 positivity rate in Bhopal is 9% , i.e, nine in every 100 people diagnosed was infected with the deadly virus. 196 new cases of the infection were reported in Bhopal on Tuesday. “We are back to the exact same situation as in mid-July 2020. History could repeat itself if Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is not adopted immediately by all of us, together,” said a senior Gandhi Medical College (GMC) consultant. It had taken six months and seven days to lower the active cases to below 1,000 in Bhopal. In mid-July last year, the active cases were around 1,000. By August first week, the Reproduction-factor resulted in over 2,000 active cases in Bhopal. By December, it had crossed 3,200 active cases. Hamidia hospital, where hospitalised Covid-19 cases had dropped to about a dozen, has seen a drastic rise in cases. Similar is the situation in other Covid-19 critical care centres in the state capital. The positivity rate has reached 9% in Bhopal and Indore, according to a government press release. Seven weeks after experts were optimistic about‘bending the curve’ in Bhopal, the deadly infection spike is being witnessed again. Even then when cases were in single or double digits, experts were warning that there is no room for complacency. “We should maintain Covid-19 preventive measures,” said Bhopal chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr Prabhakar Tiwari. Experts indicate that moderate or severe cases of the infection would still need to be monitored. The reproduction number (Ro) or Covid R number has to be kept low too. It is the average number of infections produced by a single infectious person in a population with no immunity. If the R value is less than 1, an epidemic eventually dies out because each infected person generates less than one new infection, cited a recent Lancet study. MP R-value is above 2 according to a recent report from Chennai based institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/active-caseload-in-bhopal-crosses-1k-mark-after-7-wks/articleshow/81536707.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Gang that sold 500 stolen cars busted||NEW DELHI: A gang that was stealing cars from different areas of Delhi and selling them as used cars has been busted. The kingpin of the gang, Mohsin Khan (28) from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh, has been arrested. The gang, which used to make fake documents after modifying the vehicles’ chassis and engine numbers, had sold more than 500 stolen vehicles. The central Delhi police has seized 10 cars, including a Hyundai Creta, Baleno, Brezza and a Swift Dzire. DCP (central district) Jasmeet Singh said the gang first used to collect the documents of “total loss” vehicles — cars that were fully damaged in accidents and sold to scrap dealers. “Thereafter, they stole cars of the same make and model in Delhi and altered its chassis and engine numbers to match the documents of the wrecked vehicles. They also changed the numberplate as per the registration certificate they had procured,” Singh said. The car was then sold in the market as any other used car with proper documentation, he added. The gang members themselves procured the information about “total loss” vehicles from insurance companies that didn’t destroy the papers as per rules even after the vehicle was disposed of as scrap. The gang was busted by a team led by ACP O P Lekhwal and sub-inspector Sandeep Godara. Khan’s associate, Babloo, who stole vehicles, is absconding. After receiving a tip-off about Khan, he was arrested from near GB Pant Hospital while trying to steal a vehicle. A loaded pistol was found on him and the scooter he was riding was also found to be a stolen one. Khan told police that he had also bought stolen cars from an auto lifter named Babloo belonging to Moradabad, UP. Through his sources, the gang used to get the documents of accidental/total loss vehicles from Delhi, Meerut, Rajasthan and Punjab. He had reportedly sold many cars in Delhi, UP, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gang-that-sold-500-stolen-cars-busted/articleshow/81537781.cms||---

Passengers are seen opening their bags near a baggage carousel, with some stating that they have lost items while others saying locks have been broken. The airline against which the allegations were made denied the claims and pointed out that not a single passenger had filed a complaint of theft. “This is with regards to a video on social media regarding alleged pilferage and broken baggage locks from Dubai to Delhi. While we take this matter very seriously and are investigating it thoroughly, we want to clarify that not even a single passenger travelling on the said flight has filed a complaint of theft,” said the airline spokesperson. An airport official also said they had been informed about the videos, but no passenger had approached them or contacted the lost and found section yet. “The airline reserves the right to take appropriate legal action against anyone trying to deliberately tarnish its image and mislead the public through fake videos/news on social media or on other platforms,” the spokesperson said. In one of the videos, a man is seen standing next to his bag, alleging that his watch has gone missing while items in his bag have been “unwrapped”. Another man is then seen claiming other passengers too have unwrapped items, including phones and watches, in their bags. Two other passengers then claim their bags have been unlocked. In another video, too, passengers claim the locks of their bags are found broken. The airport official said, “CCTV footage can be checked only if there is a complaint. However, it does not appear the locks were broken in Delhi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/flyers-allege-baggage-pilferage-airline-says-no-complaint-filed/articleshow/81537810.cms||---

Though the incident took place a year ago, and the girl was subsequently rescued after the intervention of the child welfare committee (CWC), police registered a case only now after the Madras high court took cognisance of the incident. The accused was identified as Ferlin Nilofer from Avenue Street in SS Colony. She is the second wife of Abdul Rahman. The girl is Rahman’s daughter through his first wife, who is no more. The ill treatment came to light in mid-March last year, when an anonymous person reported the incident through Childline. Following the alert, CWC conducted an inquiry with the child and her parents. The child had injury marks caused by finger nails all over her body. She also had burn injury marks on her hands caused by hot water poured by Nilofer. The CWC sent the girl child for counselling to a psychiatrist and got a report that she was psychologically affected due to harassment. While CWC handed her over to her elder sister who is living in Chennai, the committee did not report the incident to the police. Meanwhile, Rahman moved the court seeking custody of his daughter. During the trial, the court felt that those who harassed the child should not go unpunished and asked the police to take appropriate action. CWC chairman Vijaya Saravanan blamed the child’s sister for not coming forward to lodge a case. “The committee did not file a complaint due to practical difficulties. We get so many complaints every month and if we become complainants in all the cases, it would be difficult for us to follow them in court,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/stepmom-arrested-for-torturing-girl-11/articleshow/81539264.cms||V Devanathan

The string of deaths began when a 10-year-old boy accidentally fell into an under-construction septic tank which was filled with filth flowing from another tank nearby in Pratapura. To rescue the child, his two brothers, an uncle and a neighbour went inside the 12-feet deep tank one by one. No one came back. Anurag Sharma had slipped into the open tank while playing outside his house. His elder brothers Hari Mohan (17) and Avinash Sharma (16) jumped into the gaping hole soon after hearing the wails of their younger sibling. Then, panic-stricken, their uncle Sonu Sharma (32) followed. Another person, a neighbour, Yogesh Baghel (20), known to be a close family friend, tried to save them, paying with his life. All of them fell unconscious and died on the spot. According to villagers, the tank was dug three days ago and was not covered. It contained four-feet-deep sewage water. “The five people were declared brought dead at the SN Medical College. We will help the family to the extent we can,” said senior superintendent of police Babloo Kumar said. Watch Tragic!

---||Nagpur||Day 2: 737 fined for no mask, Rs3.99L recovered||Nagpur: The spike in Covid cases and the resultant imposition of the weeklong lockdown that got stricter on Tuesday hasn’t made people fall in line. Day two of the lockdown saw many violations by people which failed the exercise to contain the spread of the virus. Around 41 offences were registered and 1,451 vehicles were seized from which Rs Rs 3.99 lakh fine was recovered. Around 737 were pulled up for not wearing masks and another 871 for flouting social distancing in day long actions. While roads in the city’s commercial areas were by and large deserted, many people were seen venturing out without any valid reason. Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s nuisance detection squad (NDS) spotted a Covid-19 positive patient from Ashi Nagar zone moving around freely and imposed a fine of Rs 5,000. Only pharmacies and other essential shops were open across the city. Commercial establishments and markets remained closed on Tuesday. The NMC reduced the fleet of Aapli Bus from 252 to 90, said a senior official from the transport department. With commercial areas remaining shut, autorickshaw drivers too witnessed almost no business on the second consecutive day. Mahendra Jain, a resident of Mahendra Nagar under Ashi Nagar zone, was found violating the Covid-19 protocol. Despite testing positive for coronavirus, Jain was found missing from home isolation by the civic cops. NDS commandant Virsen Tambe told TOI that Jain and his wife tested positive for Covid-19. His wife was hospitalized, while Jain had been advised home quarantine. However, on Tuesday, the NDS team found him missing from home. After making enquiries, it came to the fore that Jain had gone to hospital to give tiffin to his hospitalized wife, Tambe said. As a result, the NDS team imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on Jain. City police had blocked 14 flyovers and some feeder roads too. Shortage of barricades affected police work as they could not block many lanes. City police chief Amitesh Kumar said on Tuesday that private premises would be brought under the scanner for violations. “Police would check private offices as there were complaints and observations by field units too have suggested an abnormal rush of office-goers twice a day. We cannot rule out crowding on roads during office hours due to violations of the attendance norms set by the civic body,” said Kumar. Kumar added that an IT park-based office premises of a financial institution was raided jointly by the police and NMC personnel. “Action was initiated against the institution for violations of mask use and physical distancing norms. We also sent the police to a Khamla-based school for action after objectionable crowding was observed both inside and outside the premises,” the CP said, adding, “On day two, we re-oriented and re-designed bandobast plans after inputs from zonal DCPs.” Earlier in the day, Zonal DCP Neelotpal and teams of Jaripatka and Koradi police stations stepped up the momentum with strict checking of two-wheelers and four-wheelers. Several vehicles were detained and drivers were penalized for violations of physical distancing and mask norms. Zonal DCP Vinita S had conducted a raid on the travels busses at Dhantoli near the Yeshwant Stadium on Tuesday. A bus was detained after it was found plying with 56 passengers which was almost double it's capacity. The bus was heading to Lalitpur in MP from Nagpur. Stricter checking was conducted by the combined squads of traffic and police stations in parts of north Nagpur like Kamal Chowk, Indora Chowk and Khobragade Chowk on the Jaripatka ring road. Joint teams were also found active near Mayo hospital on Central Avenue and also Cotton Market Chowk. Ashiwin Mehadia, president of Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce, said traders have extended full cooperation to the closure only due to fear of the law. “If the lockdown goes beyond March 21 then the traders’ association may rebel and take on the authorities directly,” he claimed. BC Bhartia, president of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), questioned the logic behind the lockdown. There are instances like the election crowding in West Bengal or the farmers’ agitation from where no outbreak of Covid-19 is being reported despite the huge gatherings and blatant violations of norms. “The police were fairly considerate and once our employees showed their ID cards they did not object,” said Ranjit Dani of M/s Think Consultants, a financial advisory firm. He said even backend work related to investments went on smoothly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/day-2-737-fined-for-no-mask-rs3-99l-recovered/articleshow/81537807.cms||Soumitra Bose

Speaking to reporters along with Madurai MP Su Venkatesan, they said that former Madurai MP P Mohan had been instrumental in bringing many developmental activities to Madurai including two Kendriya Vidyalayas to Thiruparankundram. “It was the efforts of the CPM which helped in bringing the IT park to Vadapalanji in Madurai, but Tamil Nadu Revenue Minister R B Udhayakumar who has been the representative of the region for ten years had not been able to bring any big projects to the region.

---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: 2 held for selling abducted kids to childless couples for Rs 60-70,000||AGRA: The police in Aligarh have arrested two youths for allegedly abducting two toddlers from two different places in the city and later selling them to childless couples. Both the children have been rescued, one from Moradabad and the other from Delhi, and handed over to their parents. The police also arrested two persons on the charges of purchasing the children. Police said two minor children were allegedly abducted by two youths -- identified as Sher Mohammad, 23, and Shahrukh, 21, -- from two different places in Aligarh within a span of five months. The first FIR was registered for the kidnapping of two-and-half-year-old Aayan on October 6, 2020, and the second FIR was lodged with the same charges after the disappearance of two-and-a-half-year-old Shoib on March 12 this year. Aayan was sold to a resident of Moradabad, identified as Ehsan, for Rs 60,000. The accused got bolder when the law could not catch them and they planned another kidnapping to earn more money. This time they decided to sell the child, Shoib, for Rs 70,000 to one Rukhsana, a resident of Bijnor who is relative of Ehsan. Explaining the link between the abductors and the purchasers of the abducted children, circle officer (Civil Lines) Anil Samaniya told TOI that Rukhsana, who was taking fertility treatment at a private hospital, met Shahrukh’s relative who works as a sanitation worker at the centre and she introduced the two for getting them a child from some orphanage. Without enquiring much, Rukhsana told her relative Ehsan about it as they were also childless. Ehsan then bought Aayan from Shahrukh, who told the couple that the papers from the orphanage home would be provided later. After a few months, Shahrukh and Sher Mohammad sold Shoib to Rukhsana. Rukhsana took the child to her parents’ house in Delhi from where he was rescued by the police. Samaniya said Sher Mohammad and Shahrukh have been booked under sections 363 and 370 (4) of IPC while Rukhsana and Ehsan were booked under section 368 of IPC at Kawarsi police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/2-held-for-selling-abducted-kids-to-childless-couples-for-rs-60-70k/articleshow/81536715.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||UN rapporteur cites SC order on 3 Gujarat units||Ahmedabad: In its recent report to the UN, the special rapporteur on human rights cited how in the case of three Gujarat industrial units, the Supreme Court in April 2020 refused ‘post facto environmental clearances’. The SC order in April last year, with respect to civil appeal 1526 of 2016, was related to three industrial units involved in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, and bulk drugs at Ankleshwar. They operated for several years without valid environment clearances. The SC in its order stated that industries “cannot be oblivious to the environmental degradation” caused by operating “without valid ECs”. The court directed the three companies to deposit compensation of Rs 10 crore each with the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to be used for restitution and restoration of the environment in the industrial area. The UN special rapporteur exclusively pointed to the draft notification of the Environment Impact Assessment Notification 2020 issued by the Union environment ministry. It said: “In clauses 14 (2) and 26, an exemption [is given to] several large industries and projects from public consultation — as a part of the environment impact assessment process.” It added: “These exemptions are unwarranted given the substantial environmental and human rights negative impacts that can arise from projects in these areas. This is of great concern after recent toxic gas leak in Andhra Pradesh on May 12 last year.” As for the Gujarat units, the special rapporteur cited the SC order which said: “Given the social and environmental impacts of an industrial activity, environment compliance must not be seen as an obstacle to development but as a measure towards achieving sustainable development and inter-generational equity.” The SC order had added, “The concept of an ex post facto EC is in derogation of the fundamental principles of environmental jurisprudence and is an anathema to the EIA notification dated 27 January 1994. It is, as the judgment in Common Cause holds, detrimental to the environment and could lead to irreparable degradation.” These observations were made by the bench of Justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Justice Ajay Rastogi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/un-rapporteur-cites-sc-order-on-3-gujarat-units/articleshow/81537801.cms||---

The group also asked to reconsider declaring all pass for Classes IX to XI students. Representing 6,500 private schools across the state, the association, led by state president M Arumugam and state secretary M Muthuramalingam, highlighted that the schools have been struggling financially for months. The association has appealed the state government to help private schools and teachers financially and sought the government to bear 50% costs of salaries for private school teachers during the lockdown period. Further, FePSA demanded payment for 2020-2021 RTE admissions to be paid by April. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/let-schools-decide-on-passing-students/articleshow/81539272.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Ruckus in House over phone taps, BJP MLA suspended||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday cited his original response to a question about alleged phone-tapping raised in the assembly last year in a bid to combat the resurgence of a controversy that he said had been raked up by BJP just to disrupt the current session. Gehlot's counter came on a day when BJP legislator Madan Dilawar was suspended from the House for a week for alleged misbehaviour when his party was demanding a debate on the issue. The CM claimed squabbling within BJP was the reason behind the resurgence of a non-issue, more so after he had long contested charges of phone-tapping and said on record that “it is not the tradition of the state to tap phones of MLA and MPs illegally”. He released a statement in which he categorically said that “it (phone-tapping) has never happened in Rajasthan”. ‘BJP’s claims don’t hold true’“This is a fight of domination within BJP ranks,” Gehlot said in his rejoinder on FB. “The issue is being unnecessarily raised, and it is being done to disturb the house.” The embers of the phonetapping debate were reignited by the state administration's official reply to an August 2020 question by BJP MLA Kalicharan Saraf in the assembly belatedly appearing on the assembly's portal. The reply states that phone calls had been “intercepted” by the police “after obtaining permission from the competent officer”. This was done “in the interest of public safety or public order”, the reply mentions. BJP has since accused Gehlot of lying in the assembly about not tapping phones and demanded a CBI inquiry. On BJP's allegation about Congress resorting to phonetapping to save the Gehlot government in the face of a Sachin Pilot-led revolt, the CM said, “BJP's claims don’t hold true. The chief secretary or the home secretary, all of them have to do their job legally. Surveillance is done in accordance with rules and regulations.” Gehlot said the onus was on BJP to come out with definite proof about whose phones were tapped and why. “If these allegations are proved, I will leave politics,” he said. In the assembly on Tuesday, suspended MLA Dilawar allegedly shouted down Independent legislator Sanyam Lodha, who had been speaking on demands for grants for education,, to demand a debate on the phone-tapping episode. After Lodha objected to Dilawar’s behaviour, Speaker C P Joshi warned the BJP MLA to back down. When Dilawar allegedly did not pay heed, Joshi asked parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal to bring a motion to suspend the legislator. The motion to suspend Dilawar from the House for seven days was passed by a voice vote. When assembly marshals removed the suspended member, BJP MLAs formed a human chain around their colleague. A scuffle ensued, following which the Speaker adjourned the House for 30 minutes, the fourth adjournment of the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ruckus-in-house-over-phone-taps-bjp-mla-suspended/articleshow/81539273.cms||---

The yield is likely to drop by over 30%, according to farmers. Firozabad, a major producer, supplies capsicum to markets in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharasthra, among others. Besides, some companies have also been directly purchasing capsicum from Firozabad farmers for the past two years. The sowing of capsicum starts in July in Firozabad district. The first cycle of harvesting begins in November. Farmers harvest eight to 10 cycles of produce till mid-April. Rajesh Pratap Singh, a Narkhi block-based farmer who had sown capsicum across 18 acres, said, “We had a good harvest till the fifth cycle of produce. After February 15, the temperature started rising. The mercury has remained several notches above normal throughout March so far. The increased temperature has resulted in early harvesting. The quality of the produce has declined. The size of capsicum has significantly reduced. We will be seeing at least a 30% drop in yield this year.” Firozabad district horticulture officer Vinay Yadav said, “This year, the temperature has been above normal since February 15. The average temperature in the first half of March has been higher than that in the past five years. The rise in temperature is harmful for the capsicum crop. It will impact crop yield. Profit margins of farmers will reduce. At least, farmers had five cycles of bumper harvest.” The maximum temperature in Agra region, of which Firozabad is a part, on Tuesday was recorded at 34.9 degrees Celsius which was 3 degrees above normal. At 18.1 degrees Celsius, the minimum temperature was recorded 4 degrees above normal. Last year on March 16, the maximum temperature in the Agra region was recorded at 25 degrees Celsius and the minimum was 13.4 degrees. According to the meteorological department, the maximum temperature is likely to go up to 37 degrees Celsius later this week. The minimum temperature may also rise by 4 degrees. Besides, there is a possibility of one or two spells of rain or thundershowers on March 18 and 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/above-normal-temperature-affects-capsicum-crop-in-firozabad/articleshow/81536727.cms||Deepak Lavania

District election officers who TOI spoke to said they have stepped up checking of online transactions based on the profile of candidates and the gravity of cash-for-votes charges against them in the previous elections. In Tuticorin, two candidates who are in the fray in Kovilpatti and Vilathikulam segments had faced voter bribing charges in their previous elections. These candidates were accused of disbursing tokens to lure voters. Tuticorin collector and district election officer K Senthil Raj said they are monitoring any online banking transaction from dormant accounts and disbursal of more than Rs 10 lakh from accounts. “We are also monitoring suspicious transactions with similar patterns,” he said. Senthil Raj added that such monitoring has been in effect since the model code of conduct came into effect. “Banks are sharing details of transactions to us through the district lead bank every day. They are analysed by the Income Tax nodal officer. The volume of transactions we are monitoring is high but we will continue to do it,” he added. In Virudhunagar, withdrawal of more than Rs 1 lakh in cash or any similarity in cash disbursal pattern from one account or multiple accounts to random people through online and mobile banking is being watched, district collector R Kannan said. “We are conducting random checks even if it is salary disbursal,” he added. Another district election officer said they don’t have candidates with such suspicious modes of operation but checking bank transactions will be stepped up as the election nears.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/bank-e-transactions-come-under-scanner/articleshow/81539268.cms||M K Ananth

The managements of schools and colleges in the district remain vigilant despite no new cases recorded among staff or students. Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) vice-chancellor M Krishnan said even though the university campus is fully functional and hostels open, there have been no new cases recently. “We are very strict in Covid-19 safety measures. However, there has been no Covid-19 cases reported recently in the university or even affiliated colleges except for the few cases reported in MKU Evening College few weeks back,” he said. All colleges are currently functioning with only limited number of students visiting the campus mainly for practical work and exams which are being conducted through online mode. In both government and private schools, teachers are exercising caution. “We ensure plenty of open space for students to avoid crowding and masks are mandatory. We are sending children home immediately if they show signs of fever or cough, even if it is not Covid-19,” said the principal of a private matriculation school.

---||Vijayawada||Govt to bring ordinance to create 2 dy mayor posts||Amaravati: The government has decided to bring an ordinance to create two deputy mayor posts in each municipal corporation. Similarly, two vice-chairperson posts will be created for each municipality. The decision has been taken by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy with a view to maintain social balance by accommodating more leaders from weaker-sections in high-ranking urban local body posts. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, panchayat raj minister Peddireddi Ramanchadra Reddy said that the chief minister is keen on empowering people from weaker sections. He said the party would appoint BC, SC, ST and minorities in mayor and chairperson posts wherever possible. He said that the chief minister had already directed to give highest priority to the weaker sections in selecting the candidates for the top posts. “The government has decided to amend the Municipal Corporations Act to create two deputy mayor posts in corporations and two vice-chairperson posts in the municipalities. However, the elections to the mayor posts will be held on Thursday as per the schedule issued by the state election commission (SEC),” said Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy. The minister said that election to the deputy mayor and vice-chairperson posts would be held after getting the ordinance cleared by governor. He said that all measures have been taken for the smooth conduct of mayor and chairperson elections on March 18. Peddireddi demanded that the SEC should immediately initiate measures for the conduct of ZPTC, MPTC elections following the high court verdict. The panchayat raj minister said that the HC had directed the SEC to issue declarations to the unanimously elected ZPTC and MPTC candidates. He said that it would not take more than one week to complete the process of pending elections to the ZPTCs and MPTCs in the state. He said that vaccination programme was getting delayed due to the pendency of elections to ZPTCs and MPTCs. The minister added that SEC Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar should demit office by completing the elections to pending rural local bodies as he kick-started the process with village panchayat elections despite the fact they were not kept in abeyance. “The SEC had decided to hold panchayat elections by ignoring the pending ZPTC and MPTC elections. Since the HC cleared all the legal hurdles, he should at least initiate the process now and retire after the completion of the elections,” he said. Peddireddi, who hails from Chittoor district, exuded confidence that YSRC would win Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election with an over 3 lakh vote majority. He said that the party candidate would win without much difficulty just because of welfare programmes initiated by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-to-bring-ordinance-to-create-2-dy-mayor-posts/articleshow/81536644.cms||Samdani MN

Tadipatri municipality in Anantapur and Mydukur municipality in Kadapa are two civic bodies where YSRC were runners-up to TDP. TDP, which received drubbings in local body elections across the state, secured 18 of the 36 wards in Tadipatri municipality while the YSRC won 16 wards. In Mydukur municipality, TDP won 12 of the 24 seats while YSRC won 11, and Jana Sena won one. With the stage set now for mayor and deputy mayor elections on March 18, camp politics is in full swing. TDP is trying to keep its cadres together but with victory margins in both municipalities very narrow, the ruling YSRC is eyeing control of the two civic bodies on account of its ex-officio votes of its legislators. Meanwhile, former TTD trust board chairman and TDP’s Mydukur in-charge Putta Sudhakar Yadav alleged that the ruling party was resorting to misuse of power to prevent elected ward members of TDP to take part in mayoral elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/eyes-on-tadipatri-mydukur-as-ysrc-aims-perfect-score/articleshow/81536680.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

The YSRC high command has been approached by two groups within the party, both with complaints against each other. The chairperson’s post had been earmarked for a woman from the general category but in the party’s victorious run, women from the Settibalija community bagged nine of the 19 seats won. Under the general category, Sunkara Parvati and Kollati Durgabhai won but one group has been calling for Vasamsetty Krishna Kumari, who belongs to the Settibalija community, to be the frontrunner for the chairperson’s post. Kumari is the mother of YSRC youth leader Vasamsetty Subhash, which is being seen as an advantage. Meanwhile the other group under former MLA Kudupudi Chittabbai, has alleged that the Subhash-led group was responsible for the defeat of Chittabbai’s daughter-in-law, Satya Sailaja, who was their contender for the chairperson’s post. The group has filed a complaint to district in-charge, YV Subba Reddy. BC welfare minister Pinipe Viswarup has left the decision on chairperson’s post with the party high command. It is very likely the party’s selection for the chairperson’s post will arrive in a sealed cover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ysrc-cadre-split-over-amalapuram-chair-post/articleshow/81536702.cms||Samson Raj

Had he gone to his constituency and assembly regularly, he would have contested there,” he told reporters at Kalugumalai during an interaction. “I have not missed the assembly proceedings over the years. That is the difference between me and him,” he said. Raju also alleged that as Periyakulam MP in 1999, Dhinakaran had not performed his duties which led to his defeat in 2004 to a not-so-popular Congress candidate. “He went to Chennai and never returned to Periyakulam,” he said adding that Dhinakaran’s remarks that a functionary of his party would be in Kovilpatti on his behalf after the elections indicated what was in store. The minister also accused Dhinakaran of making ministers and MPs wait for long hours when he was influential in the AIADMK. “If people of Kovilpatti think about that he will not get his deposit back,” the minister said in response to Dhinakaran’s statement that all the other candidates will lose their deposits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/tamil-nadu/why-is-ttv-running-away-from-r-k-nagar-min-raju/articleshow/81544795.cms||---

The minister also accused Dhinakaran of making ministers and MPs wait for long hours when he was influential in the AIADMK. “If people of Kovilpatti think about that he will not get his deposit back,” the minister said in response to Dhinakaran’s statement that all the other candidates will lose their deposits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/why-is-ttv-running-away-from-r-k-nagar-min-raju/articleshow/81539275.cms||---

Out of the 34 students, 27 have already paid their fees while the rest are about to finish the procedures for final registration. The students registered in the department come from different states like Jammu & Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat. There are international students from Bangladesh too. “Research in Indian languages, Indic knowledge systems, folk lore, folk narratives of Jhaverchand Meghani, Charan literature of Gujarat and Rajasthan, to the sparingly explored graphic novels, to exploring the idea of the nation in the 21st century, many new avenues of interdisciplinary research have come up,” professor Hitesh Raviya, head of the department, said. One of the topic of research aims to address the challenges of online teaching and learning of English during the pandemic times. “The research themes address the questions of curriculum designing, testing and evaluation of English language at undergraduate level, of mobile assisted language learning, the outcomes of which might contribute in making appropriate policy decisions by the higher education authorities,” he added. The department has registered students for the PhD programme in tandem with the reservation policy of Gujarat government, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/msu-proposes-record-34-from-english-dept-for-phd/articleshow/81536149.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Covid patients in pvt hospitalsmore than double in NMC, govt||Nagpur: The number of Covid-19 patients in private hospitals is more than double than that in government-run and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) hospitals in the district. Also, over 83% patients are in home isolation. Due to sudden spike, active cases in the district on Tuesday jumped to 18,980, which is second highest in the country after Pune. Of these, status of 16,393 patients could be known from the data released by civil surgeon. As on date, 13,862 (73%) patients were in home isolation and 2,531 (13.34%) in hospitals and Covid Care Centres (CCCs). Status of 2,587 (13.63%) persons, who tested positive on Tuesday, was not known. As per the NMC data, there are 3,863 beds in hospitals run by the civic body, government and private establishments in the city. Of the total 1,550 beds in NMC and government-run hospitals, 711 were occupied on Tuesday and 839 vacant. Of the total 2,313 beds in private hospitals, 1,304 were occupied and 1,009 vacant. Thus, total 1,848 (47.84%) beds were vacant and 2,015 (52.16%) occupied. Of the total 2,015 hospitalized patients, 1,304 (64.71%) are undergoing treatment in private hospitals and 711 (35.29%) in NMC and government-run hospitals. In August and September last year, when the district witnessed peak of the pandemic, the scenario was completely different. Private hospitals started treating Covid patients from the first week of August. The number of hospitals and beds were increased in phased manner. Despite this, the city experienced severe Covid bed shortage in two months. TOI on Tuesday had highlighted how the Covid scenario is different this time as majority of cases are being reported from posh localities in the city during the second wave, compared to congested and slum areas which had faced the brunt in the first wave. Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association Dr Anup Marar said, “The situation in August and September last year was completely different than the present. In the beginning, people used to get scared after testing positive, irrespective of symptoms or not. Therefore, Covid patients got admitted wherever the beds were available. As a result, beds in government hospitals were full.” “Now, as the awareness level has increased about Covid, patients check symptoms, oxygen saturation level, undergo various tests, consult doctors and then get hospitalized, only if necessary. Sufficient beds are available in private hospitals and hence occupancy is high compared to government hospitals,” said Dr Marar. “Another reason might be that more number of symptomatic and contacts of positive patients from posh and middle class areas are undergoing Covid testing. In comparison, the number of tests is less in congested and slum areas,” he said. Meanwhile, assistant commissioner of Food and Drug Administration PM Ballal, in a press release, said sufficient doses of Remdesivir (administered to Covid patients) are available in Nagpur division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-patients-in-pvt-hospitalsmore-than-double-in-nmc-govt/articleshow/81537849.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Dehradun||Sweaty palms make 19-yr-old fail IAF med test, Botox gives him second shot||Dehradun: For three years, a 19-year-old boy from a village in Uttarakhand had been struggling with the simplest tasks — writing, holding a bat, riding a bike. All because his palms would sweat, excessively, to a point that he could barely have a grip over anything. When it seemed he might lose his chance at becoming an IAF airman because of this, he was shattered. That’s when doctors at the Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) came up with a solution — Botox. The use of Botox to treat excessive perspiration has been found effective before, and has been in use in urban India. With this, the IAF aspirant will now be able to take another shot at his medical test, scheduled later this month. It was during his half-yearly exams in Class XI that he noticed the problem for the first time. His palm was getting so sweaty he could not hold the pen and the writing kept getting smudged — in the chilling December of Uttarakhand. At the time, he was a year into preparing for the IAF. After Class X, he had moved to Dehradun for a BSc degree and to take coaching. His elder brother, also a college student, is preparing to get into the Army. The village they come from is one where at least one person in every family is engaged with the defence forces. He passed the written exam, the physical exam and the interview. Things were looking up. But he stumbled during the medical exam — he could not hold on to a pipe he was asked to climb or do pushups. He was asked to reappear. This was in February. He rushed to the GDMC to look for a solution. Doctors ran tests for everything from blood sugar to thyroid and blood pressure, but found no answer. “Initially, we prescribed medicines to control the sweating. But after taking medicines for 10 days, he told us about his medical exam and requested something that is immediately effective,” said Dr Shruti Barnwal, head of the department, dermatology, at GDMC. That’s when they turned to Botox. “It is common in India, but is known as a beauty treatment. But Botox injections have botulinum toxin, which blocks nerve signals responsible for sweating,” said Dr Bhavya Sangal, who attended to him. But it would have been expensive — the treatment costs between Rs 40,000 and Rs 50,000 — for the son of a small private firm employee. The doctors decided to help. They didn’t charge any fees, got the syringe at a subsidised rate and procured the Botox from a dealer at a wholesale price of Rs 18,000, less than half of what he would have had to pay. The procedure took about 40 minutes. Sangal said, “He is now ready for his second medical test.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/sweaty-palms-make-19-yr-old-fail-iaf-med-test-botox-gives-him-second-shot/articleshow/81536877.cms||Ishita Mishra

The victim Mahesh Parmar was thrown from the 35 foot high bridge into Machchu River by his wife Bharati’s lover Kuldeep Rathod and his two brothers early on Tuesday morning Parmar, however, knew swimming and reached the river bank and called up his brothers who rushed him to Rajkot Civil Hospital. According to case details, Bharati and Kuldeep had eloped four days ago and she had taken along one of her two daughters. Parmar as well as Kuldeep’s brothers - Sumit and Chirag - searched for them and got to know about their location in Surat. Parmar, his brother, Kuldeep’s brothers and others left in two vehicles for Surat and traced the duo. They were bringing them back to their native Makansar village. Parmar, Bharti, Kuldeep and Chirag were in one vehicle while others were following them in another. Early on Tuesday morning, Parmar stopped the vehicle near the railway bridge to relieve himself. Sensing an opportunity, Kuldeep and his brothers lifted Parmar and threw him into the river from the bridge. While they fled from there, Parmar somehow swam to the bank and called up his brother who was coming in another car. “We have booked all four for attempt to murder,” said Wankaner police station sources. The victim as well as accused are farm labourers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/wife-paramour-hurl-husband-into-river/articleshow/81536892.cms||---
---||Nagpur||It’s raining excuses for cops at nakabandi points||Nagpur: City police were at the receiving end of motorists offering strange reasons justifying stepping out even after the civic body chief B Radhakrishnan, guardian minister Nitin Raut and commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar made repeated appeals to stay indoors in the backdrop of the extended restrictions to break the corona chain. Apart from regular excuses like going to essential shops, pharmacies, hospitals, construction sites and offices, there were several other reasons given by citizens to cops deployed at nakabandi points to check movement of masses and vehicular traffic to enforce the restrictions. Assistant commissioner of police Parshuram Karyekarta said a couple on a bike wanted him to allow them to ply despite one person per two-wheeler rule. “The couple was carrying a pet dog which they wanted to take to a veterinarian. They wanted me to allow them as one would hold the dog while other would ride the bike. Many times we have to allow them on humanitarian grounds,” he said. Senior inspector Vijay Akot of Beltarodi police station sounded baffled stating how a youngster claimed to be returning from college when educational institutions are shut. “A person clicked a selfie with me at the nakabandi point and sent it to his employees claiming that cops were not allowing him to move and hence he was returning home,” said Akot. Senior inspector Jayesh Bhandarkar of Tehsil police station said he was surprised when a biker said he wanted to go to an eye clinic but later changed his version, saying he was visiting a cardiologist. “It was after we made someone sit in the police vehicle that they revealed the truth and sought forgiveness,” he said. Zonal DCP Neelotpal, who was at the Khobragade chowk on the Jaripatka ring road, was also given several reasons by citizens whom he had stopped to check. Two youngsters, stopped by the cops working under Neelotpal’s supervision, claimed that they were heading to a hospital to deliver food to their sister who had just delivered. “There were endless claims of going to buy vegetables and meat. We came across people claiming to be going for different types of works ranging from hospital ward boy to construction sites and other offices as relaxations are allowed,” he said. Zonal DCP Lohit Matani said claiming to be moving around under various relaxations cannot be termed as ‘excuses’ but people had their varied reasons to offer them at check points.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/its-raining-excuses-for-cops-at-nakabandi-points/articleshow/81537859.cms||Soumitra Bose

This will increase seating capacity by 20% from 30 sleeper berths to 36, an official said. According to a letter written by Piyush Jain, Director (MVL) at Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) to state transport commissioners and principal secretaries (transport) on Tuesday, 'the enforcement agencies and RTOs have been directed for strict compliance of the new order.' The letter from Jain mentioned : "Ministry has received a reference from Maharashtra transport minister Anil Parab regarding plying of national permit tourist buses. In this regard, the ministry has amended the Central Motor Vehicle Rule 93, regarding vehicle dimensions. Through this notification, the length in respect of M3 (vehicle used for carriage of passengers comprising of nine or more seats and having goods vehicle weight more than 5 tons) including double decker buses and sleeper coaches has been amended from 12 metres to 13.5 metres in case of buses manufactured after June 26, 2020." As such, the number of berths can be increased in respect of buses procured after June 26, 2020, Jain said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/six-more-berths-for-new-luxury-buses-in-mumbai/articleshow/81539305.cms||Somit Sen
---||Ahmedabad||BJP govt brought public debt down, says Nitin Patel||Gandhinagar: Making his concluding remarks on the discussion on the state budget for 2021-22, deputy CM and finance minister Nitin Patel refuted the opposition’s contentions about the state’s public debt. He said that the state’s present ratio of public debt to the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) is lower than what it used to be when the Congress was in power. “During the tenure of the Congress governments, public debt accounted for up to 22% of the GSDP,” Patel said. “We have brought it down to 16%. Yes, the figure seems big, but it is standard practice, even in developed countries, to take loans to finance developmental activities.” Documents tabled by the government as part of the 2021-22 budget papers said the public debt of the state is expected to increase to Rs 3,00,959 crore on March 31, 2021, as compared to Rs 2,67,095 crore on March 31, 2020. Over the past four sessions, as many as 85 MLAs from the ruling party, the opposition, and the lone independent commented on the budget. The ruling BJP MLAs praised the budget plan size despite the effects of the ongoing pandemic. Congress MLAs slammed the government for the reduction in allocations to some departments and the growing public debt. “The government calls itself sensitive to the needs of all sections of society. Why has a single rupee not been allocated for minorities,” independent MLA Jignesh Mevani said. Dhoraji MLA Lalit Vasoya of the Congress said he would have congratulated the finance minister for the budget, but the total size of the budget is lesser than the state’s public debt. Patel said that the remaining work on the Narmada canal network will be hastened, as the government has agreed to a proposal to give more compensation to villagers for land acquisition. He reiterated his statement that about Rs 1,800 crore has been spent on Covid-19 treatment by the government. “Some MLA said during the discussion that no money was spent on Covid-19 treatment. There cannot be a bigger joke,” Patel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bjp-govt-brought-public-debt-down-says-nitin-patel/articleshow/81537862.cms||---

GU has already initiated exchanges on Indo-Buddhist learning and a Dalai Lama Chair on Nalanda Studies. “A proposal for preliminary collaboration was discussed at an event held recently at Siddharth University, Kapilvastu, Siddharthnagar, with Goa University on issues relating to Buddhism, given the UP institute’s location and the growing interest on the theme at both the universities. The recently established Siddharth University has an abiding interest on Buddhist studies,” Rahul Tripathi, head of political science department at GU, said. Siddharth University is located at a place known to have been the playground of Prince Siddharth, later known as Gautam Buddha. Tripathi said it was proposed that the interaction between the two universities could begin in a virtual mode and could be expanded at a later stage. “The Buddhist path of enlightenment, reason and middle path ought to show us the way out from the present frictions facing the world,” said Tripathi. He was speaking at Siddharth University, where he was participating in the event ‘Azaadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ to celebrate the 75th year of India’s independence. Only the deep civilizational and cultural legacy of secularism that India always had and the material and spiritual wealth that existed at the time will provide a basis for India to move forward, said Prof Surendra Dubey, vice-chancellor, Siddharth University. GU has already collaborated with the Foundation for Universal Responsibility of HH The Dalai Lama, at Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh, and currently, Ven Khampo Tashi Tsering is delivering lectures as visiting research professor under the Dalai Lama Chair in Nalanda Studies. The online sessions will be held up to March 17, and students will be able to benefit from online sessions starting from March 19. Khampo Tashi Tsering is introducing students to the ‘Aspects of the Nalanda Tradition: The Methodologies of Enquiry, Understanding the Mind & its Training. The Nature of Consciousnesses.’ The interactions have been kept open to students, researchers, faculty members as well as the general public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gu-up-varsity-may-partner-on-buddhist-studies/articleshow/81539292.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The Deendayal Port Trust (DPT) gave green signal to the service run by Angriya sea eagle limited couple of days back. The service was suspended because of reduction in water depth. To address the issue, it has been decided that the ferry will be operated only during the high tide and only passenger services will be resumed. The ferry service resumed three days back and the operations have been limited to one commute per day. The service is primarily aimed for the middle-class who uses bus service for transportation. “This is not Ro Ro service, so people are not coming with cars to board the ferry. We have provided bus service connecting Bhavnagar city from Ghogha and Ankleshwar from Dahej. We are testing the waters here, if we get a good response we will start more trips,” DPT chairman S K Mehta said. The passenger ferry service has a capacity of 130 persons. The service will prove beneficial for labourers living in Bhavnagar and working in Dahej industries. There are five pick and drop points at Bhavnagar and Dahej. The ferry ticket is priced at Rs 350 and the passengers who want to avail the bus service have to pay extra. The Ghogha-Dahej ferry service has been facing problems since it was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2017. Its operations were suspended indefinitely in September 2019 following heavy siltation in the navigation channel due to discharge of water from Sardar Sarovar dam. The union shipping ministry took over the Ro Ro ferry project from Gujarat Maritime Board in June 2020 and in last November the Ghogha-Hazira ferry service was started by DPT. The port currently has issued the tenders to construct permanent jetty at Hazira.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/ghogha-dahej-ferry-service-resumes-after-18-months/articleshow/81536921.cms||---

There are may be arrangement at a government facility or a hotel in some places or one may be simply turned back. On Monday, the MP government issued directions calling for a seven-day quarantine for those travelling from Maharashtra. This includes residents of MP itself and even persons from other states. Officials also clarified that there will always be scope for a case-to-case relaxation. Movement is being allowed for working in establishments on either side or any other dire emergency. MP had imposed curbs last month itself. However, among neihbouring districts, only Chhindwara had strictly imposed the no certificate no entry rule. After the fresh order by the state’s home department, all the districts of MP will have the same norm. This means either a resident of Maharashtra passes with a Covid certificate or stays under quarantine wherever possible, said bureaucrats in MP contacted by TOI. The practical difficulties will be dealt with, as and when encountered, said officials. The move is expected to affect traffic between the two states. Pockets in Madhya Pradesh like the Pench tiger reserve or Pachmarhi hill station are favourite tourist deviations for those in Vidarbha. The Vidarbha region borders six districts of Madhya Pradesh—Chhindwara, Seoni, Balaghat, Betul, Khandwa, Burhanpur. A large number of people travel to Nagpur from cities like Jabalpur, Satna Narisnghpur too for medical treatment. The move is expected to hit tourism in Madhya Pradesh, say resort owners. Doctors in Nagpur say healthcare in towns of the neighouring state can be affected too due to the curbs. A letter has been sent to all the resort owners in Pench by the police. It says they will have to submit a report about the tourists each day by 6pm and guests should be only allowed with a Covid negative report through RTPCR test. “The sudden announcement of restrictions from both sides of the border has drastically affected our business for this week and the weeks ahead. On an average, 50% bookings are being cancelled. This leaves us in a tough spot because overheads are fixed and they amount to almost 70% of our operational costs. Since 90% of the tourism is from Nagpur, one can understand the scale of business getting hit,” said Sandeep Singh, a member of Pench Jungle Lodges’ Association. Dr Anup Marar, convener of Vidarbha Hospitals’ Association (VHA), said the curb can affect patient flow from MP. Many also come for getting Covid treated. District collector of Chhindwara Saurav Kumar Suman told TOI that entry to workplaces will be subject to employers’ responsibility. At the Raymond’s unit across the border, the employer will have to ensure that the workers don’t go out of the plant. In Burhanpur, passes will be issued for workers crossing the border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mp-travel-curbs-may-hit-tourism-healthcare/articleshow/81537899.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Goa||After SC rap, govt issues new notification on ward reservation||PANAJI: The department of urban development on Tuesday issued a notification reserving wards for the municipal councils of Mormugao, Mapusa, Margao, Quepem and Sanguem, in compliance with the Supreme Court order last week. The court had rapped the department for its failure in following the rotation system in reserving seats, as well as faltering in accurately reserving seats for women, OBC, SC and STs. Under Tuesday’s freshly-issued notification, the number of wards reserved for women in each of five councils has been increased by one. Similarly, seats reserved for OBC candidates are also up by one in each council. A total of 34 seats have been reserved for women, five for SC, eight for ST, and 27 for OBC. By the earlier notification, 29 seats were served for women, two for SC, five for ST and 22 for OBC. It was alleged that the rotation policy which is normally followed while reserving seats was given a complete miss, especially in Mormugao municipality. The seats were allegedly earmarked in five councils as per the diktats of certain politicians. With the fresh reservation coming into effect, the panels supported by the ruling BJP stand affected, a political observer said. He added that the party will now have to look for fresh candidates in the newly-reserved wards as its plan to floor opposition-supported candidates by earmarking wards in such a way that it would benefit its candidates stands defeated. The SC has also cancelled elections to the five councils, which were scheduled for March 21. Elections to 11 councils and the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) were scheduled on March 20, but the election date of five councils was shifted after the high court order. The SEC, without wasting much time, announced elections to the five councils — whose reservation of wards was stayed by the high court, but its order challenged in the SC – for March 21, no sooner had the SC stayed the HC order. The opposition said there was no explicit order from the court for the SEC to go ahead with elections of five councils, and that a final order was awaited.  Meanwhile, the new schedule for elections will be announced once the post of state election commissioner — which has fallen vacant with the resignation of IAS officer Chokha Ram Garg last week — is filled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-sc-rap-govt-issues-new-notification-on-ward-reservation/articleshow/81539301.cms||Bindiya Chari

Cordelia Cruises has announced that it plans to start sailing from May onwards. Resumption in the domestic cruise sector will not only boost tourism but will also provide employment opportunities for Goans who were earlier employed on MV Karnika, the vessel operated by Jalesh Cruises. “Karnika has been scrapped, but Cordelia Cruises has replaced Jalesh and they have taken over the operations,” said Parixit Pai Fondekar, the managing director of Kamaxi Overseas Consultants. “Though the ship Karnika has been scrapped, Cordelia have brought in a new ship from Royal Caribbean. Bookings have opened up and they are planning to start sailing from the month of May.” Cordelia Cruises has purchased the cruise vessel Empress of the Seas from Royal Caribbean International. The novel coronavirus pandemic wrecked havoc in the global economy with the cruise industry being just one of the many victims. However, sources pointed out that India had just begun to test the waters when the pandemic dealt a knock-out punch to both the firms that started cruises between Goa and Mumbai — Jalesh Cruises and Angriya Cruises. At present Angriya Cruises is operating as a mid-sea floatel for sailors off Sri Lanka, performing the role of a safe sea bubble for crew embarking and disembarking ships. In a statement, Angriya Cruises said that it hopes to resume operations by mid-2021. Cordelia Cruises has already contacted Goan seafarers in preparation for the planned cruises in May. A mail seeking Cordelia Cruises’ inputs went unanswered. “As we speak, we are getting the crew geared up, getting their documentation in place and all their paperwork ready in order to join for the May sailing season. All the staff that was working on Jalesh will move to Cordelia and the news is that they have bought a second sister ship and that will join shortly,” said Fondekar, who runs a firm to recruit crew for cruise lines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-covid-hiatus-domestic-cruise-sector-to-restart-by-may/articleshow/81539319.cms||Newton Sequeira

The report of IQAir, a Swiss air quality solution company, which assessed the average air quality parameters of over 7,700 cities in 106 countries in the year 2020, found Ghaziabad to be second most polluted in the world and placed Kanpur and Lucknow on eighth and ninth spots respectively. The assessment is based on the annual average concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5), in air with less than 2.5mm diameter, a major pollutant produced by dust and smoke. The air quality has been measured by ground-based monitoring stations. Of the data sources included in the report, 66.6% of stations were operated by government agencies, while the remaining are managed by companies, non-profit organizations and local residents. Lucknow stood ninth with 86.2 µg/m3 PM 2.5 annual average. However, Ghaziabad adjacent to Delhi border which recorded 106.6 µg/m3 was second in poor air quality, followed by third rank holder Bulandshahr with 98.4 µg/m3.” As per WHO standards, all PM2.5 exposure has adverse effects on health, but annual average exposure below 10 µg/m3 minimizes risk. Alarmingly, Kanpur and Agra saw nearly 50% deterioration of air quality in 2020 as compared to 2019. In 2020, Kanpur ranked 8th with 89.1 µg/m3 PM 2.5 rising from 48.5µg/m3 in 2019, while Agra recorded 80.2 µg/m3 as compared to 57.2 µg/m3 in 2019. “Lucknow continues to rank among the top 10 polluted cities in the world, but there are not enough air quality monitoring stations in the city to get correct picture of pollution. The implementation of clean air action plan under National Clean Air Programme is crucial to tackling the pollution crisis. Besides other contributors, the city needs to make its transport system more eco-friendly,” said Avinash Chanchal, climate campaigner, Greenpeace India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-is-worlds-ninth-most-polluted-city-report/articleshow/81539310.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Allow coaching staff back to class: ACI||Nagpur: Even as Nagpur Municipal Corporation through its latest order has allowed school and college staff back on campus, coaching institutes in city remain disappointed. Association of Coaching Institutes (ACI) said civic authorities have been neglecting all the pleas made so far. Rajnikant Bondre, president of ACI, said, “If school and college staff can be allowed back on campus, why not the same yardstick be applied to coaching institutes. We follow safety protocols strictly and will be testing every staff member, who joins duty.” He added that the institutes did not pose any kind of health threat to students. “All our students are at home only, because there is no permission to allow them back to classrooms. So it does not make any sense to keep coaching institutes locked up while other educational institutes are opening,” said Bondre. TOI had reported earlier about ACI’s reasoning on why their staff needs to be back on campus. “The requisite digital infrastructure that teachers need for such a niche field is available at our offices. Internet speed is reliable and power back-up is also in place in case of power failure. It’s also a safe, secure and disturbance-free area which guarantees quality time online between teachers and students,” he said. ACI said that even last year when unlock orders started coming in, this sector was ignored. “We have already seen the bad effects of the lockdown on the students in the recently held JEE mains first round of exams wherein no students from our city has secured rank in the top 50. This is peculiar for Nagpur students as no such restrictions are there in other cities. Even in Pune, which has been equally hit by Covid, the authorities there have allowed coaching classes to operate online classes from their premises,” said Bondre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/allow-coaching-staff-back-to-class-aci/articleshow/81537940.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The terms of these board members ended over a year ago following which extensions were given due to the Covid-19 situation. Candidates are to fill nomination forms from March 24 to April 3. These elections will be according to the new set of rules introduced by the state government in the form of The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (Amendment) Act, 2020 in September, 2020. The new rules have reduced the number of elected members to the GSHSEB from twenty-six to nine. The election for these members is held every three years. The new Act has brought down representation of school principals on the board from six to one. Representation of higher secondary teachers and secondary teachers has gone down from five and three respectively to one each. Management associations, whose present strength on the board is four members, will see their numbers reduced to just one after these elections. Similarly, parents’ associations will see their representation on the board go from three to one after the elections, a source said. The total strength of the board including the non-elected members was sixty-four earlier. It included twenty-six elected members whose strength will come down to nine.

---||Nagpur||Fearing foul play, HC asks Ngp & Au’bad cops to probe rape case transfer by DCP||Nagpur: Censuring the police department for suspicious transfer of a rape case to Aurangabad, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high Court directed commissioners of police (CP) at both places to thoroughly investigate why a deputy commissioner of police (DCP-Zone-5) shifted the complaint by the survivor. The division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote re-transferred the rape case’s hearing from Aurangabad JMFC to chief judicial magistrate in Nagpur with immediate effect. The HC, expressing possibility of foul play, also questioned the way inquiry was completed by Aurangabad cops in quick time. “We direct CPs to inquire into sudden transfer of the case by DCP and inadequate investigation by Aurangabad police. They should initiate appropriate departmental action as may be warranted in the circumstances.” The Nagpur CP was further told to frame guidelines in consultation with the police department’s law officer and HC’s public prosecutor to be followed in the matter of transfer of investigation from one police station to another. He was further asked to circulate those for their strict compliance and implementation in the city. “Being a fit case for making further investigation into the complaint, we direct it to be carried out by the local crime branch as per Section 173(8) of the CrPC and complete it within eight weeks.” The HC directives came while hearing a plea by a rape survivor through counsel Amit Band challenging Jaripatka police’s move to transfer her complaint against accused boyfriend Saurabh Tiwari to Aurangabad’s Satara police station. Even a charge-sheet was filed there. TOI had reported about this case on March 5 after HC summoned Aurangabad police inspector probing the case. Band contended that the case shouldn’t have been transferred as the accused sexually exploited her at various places multiple times, including Nagpur and Pune. Asserting that the officer (DCP), who transferred the investigation, was a senior, the judges said he was well trained in procedural criminal law. “He would know that when an offence like that of rape has been committed at different places, there would be multiple spots of incidents requiring equal attention. He, however, didn’t make any distinction between them to categorise into primary, secondary, tertiary and the like spots of incident.” The judges pointed out that the sudden transfer of rape case and Aurangabad police hurriedly completing the investigation leaving major loopholes on some pretext, appears to be a well thought out strategy to give advantage to the accused. “The respondents thought that no one can blame Nagpur police, as the probe wasn’t made by it and so also the Aurangabad police, as the survivor didn’t cooperate which wasn’t true,” the HC said while allowing girls’ plea. WHAT HC SAID * Take departmental action against erring cops as may be warranted in circumstances * Nagpur CP to frame guidelines for transfer of case between police stations * It’s a fit case for further investigation by local crime branch * Aurangabad cops hurriedly completed investigation leaving major loopholes * It appears to be a well thought out strategy to give advantage to accused||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fearing-foul-play-hc-asks-ngp-aubad-cops-to-probe-rape-case-transfer-by-dcp/articleshow/81537969.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Lucknow||30 Ayodhya temples, 3 mosques in squatters’ list may be moved out||Ayodhya: The district administration in Ayodhya has identified 30 temples and three mosques that have encroached upon government land, in keeping with Allahabad high court’s directive to remove or shift religious structures encroaching on public roads or sideways. Talking to TOI, Ayodhya municipal commissioner Vishal Singh said, “Religious structures raised before 2011 will be relocated and those built after this cut-off year may be removed. We have sent a list of 33 such religious structures to the government for approval. We are yet to zero in on land for relocation of shrines. Also, we haven’t received a deadline for implementation of court order.” It will be a painstaking exercise as scores of devotees throng these temples mentioned in the list, he said. Also, for removing three mosques, the administration would have to talk to Sunni Board as these are waqf properties. Reacting to the civic body’s move to shortlist 30 temples, chief priest of Ayodhya’s Tapaswi Chawni temple, Mahant Paramhans Das, said, “Deities in these temples have been installed after ‘praan pratishtha’ (consecration). Hence, the government must re-think its decision and provide alternate land, where these idols can be placed after temples are removed.” Talking to TOI, Dr Najmul Hasan Ghani, state working president of Indian Union Muslim League, said, “Namaz is being offered since independence at the three mosques mentioned in the list. These are of archaeological value and Muslim sentiments will be hurt if removed.” Caretaker of a mosque on Ayodhya Road, Rafat Ansari, said, “The district administration should take the Sunni Waqf Board into confidence before initiating any action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/30-ayodhya-temples-3-mosques-in-squatters-list-may-be-moved-out/articleshow/81539324.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Ahmedabad||Overseas study plans hit, education loan disbursals dip||Ahmedabad: With fewer students opting to study abroad and educational institutions allowing students to pay fees in installments, uptakes for education loans in Gujarat declined by 8.3% in the December quarter of 2020-21. The total outstanding for education loans declined from Rs 3,591 crore to Rs 3,291 crore from the third quarter of 2019-20 to the same period in 2020-21. The information was tabled on Monday in the parliament, citing the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) data. Bankers have attributed the slowing disbursals to the dipping uptakes for foreign education. “A majority of education loan uptakes in Gujarat are from students who study abroad,” said M M Bansal, convener, SLBC-Gujarat. “However, due to the pandemic and the suspension of international flights, many have deferred plans of studying abroad by a year. Consequently, the disbursals have slowed significantly.” With education loan disbursals slowing, the non-performing assets (NPAs) have declined from Rs 97 crore in the third quarter of 2019-20 to Rs 47.3 crore in 2020-21. Bansal said that repayments continued while fresh disbursals declined and as a result, the gross NPA to outstanding ratio declined too. On a quarterly basis, the outstanding for education loans marginally increased from Rs 3,060 crore in the second quarter of 2020-21, up by Rs 231 crore, indicates the SLBC data. Banking sector sources also said that loan disbursals slowed because many institutes offered the option of paying fees in installments. Dr Navin Sheth, vice-chancellor of Gujarat Technological University (GTU), said: “At least 90% of colleges affiliated to GTU are private.” Sheth added: “Most colleges have given the option of paying fees in three to four installments. Moreover, if any student makes a representation before the varsity seeking any such relaxation, we ask the institutes to help them.” Even the state government had announced in August 2020 that students pursuing medical, dental, and paramedical courses can pay annual fees in four installments. The decision was made applicable to students studying in the 515 government, grant-in-aid, and self-financed colleges of the state. Students will have to pay the first installment (25%) of the annual fees in September, followed by three installments in the subsequent three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/overseas-study-plans-hit-education-loan-disbursals-dip/articleshow/81537989.cms||Niyati Parikh

The anti-theft squad of Kerala water authority (KWA) has registered 28 water theft cases in February and fined Rs 3.10 lakh from offenders.  In February 2020, 23 cases were reported. It has been noted that most of the cases were related to drawing water illegally from public taps after connecting hose to taps. People also draw water by connecting motors to KWA’s distribution line. “When people connect motor to the distribution line of KWA and draw water, air enters into the pipeline and block further flow of water to houses of nearby residents. If any resident refuses to remit fine, the authority will approach the court,” said assistant engineer of the squad in Ernakulam Heloshia V B. In one case, a hotelier had taken water from a house connection to his hotel. The squad had imposed a fine of Rs 16,000 from the hotelier. While two residents draw water from a disconnected connection for construction works for one month. They were fined with Rs 15,000 each. In another case reported at Chalakkudy, the squad levied Rs 2.33 lakh fine on a resident for drawing water after connecting motor directly to the water connection. Most of the complaints regarding water theft were reported from Cherai, Vypeen, Elamkunnapuzha, Chellanam, Njarakkal, Fort Kochi and Mattancherry, the areas where residents experience acute water shortage in every summer. Cases have been registered under the Kerala Water Supply and Sewerage Act 1986. As per the law, if the offence is severe, the water connection can be disconnected. The local bodies, which face drinking water issues, have been advised to provide water in tanker trucks. “Foreseeing similar situation, many panchayats have reached an agreement with various tanker truck operators transporting drinking water even before the election notification was issued. But some could not execute it. But they can do it now as drinking water issue comes under the disaster management. Model code of conduct is not applicable to this issue,” said an official of the deputy director of panchayats in the district. Chellanam panchayat is set to start distribution of drinking water through tanker trucks. “Around 150 houses in ward numbers 15 and 16 are facing drinking water shortage issue. The panchayat using its fund will start giving drinking water from Wednesday. All these houses have water connection. The water brought in tankers will be pumped into the lines using motor and residents can draw water as usual from their connections,” said Chellanam panchayat president K D Prasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kwa-special-squad-found-28-water-theft-cases-in-feb/articleshow/81536959.cms||---

The aerial survey team will be in the city on Wednesday and will do a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) survey between Nagpur and Murtizapur.“The LiDAR survey for the preparation of a detailed project report (DPR) for the proposed Mumbai-Nagpur high-speed rail corridor started on March 12 and will conclude on Wednesday. The DPR will be ready by this year-end,” said Pankaj Uke, general manager (operations), NHSRCL. Uke hails from Amravati and is on deputation with NHSRCL.During the last five days, the team covered over 500km from Nashik, Shirdi, Aurangabad, Jalna, Akola, Amravati and Karanja. The proposed 736-km bullet train project will link Shahapur, Igatpuri, Nashik, Mehkar, Malegaon, Pulgaon, Wardha, and Khapri (Nagpur).“In the survey, a four-seater aircraft has been fitted with an aerial LiDAR and imagery sensors captures the data related to the ground survey. To provide clear pictures of the structures, trees, and other minute ground details, 100-megapixel cameras are being used for the survey. At least 80 ground staff have also been involved in the survey. The plane flies at 1,000 feet to capture the images,” said Uke.NSHRCL officials said the survey gives the overall information on the ground regarding alignments, physical structures, trees, utilities, landscape, etc. “We are simultaneously doing a survey of passenger traffic by hiring a private agency that has stationed its men at toll booths between Mumbai-Nagpur,” Uke stated.“It will be a dedicated line with elevated railway corridor being explored alongside the Nagpur-Mumbai Balasaheb Thackeray Samruddhi Mahamarg (expressway). We will see that bare minimum land acquisition is done to avoid hurdles and project delays,” they said.The NHSRCL has been asked to prepare DPR for seven high-speed corridors in two years. These corridors include Delhi-Lucknow-Varanasi, Delhi-Jaipur-Udaipur-Ahmedabad, Delhi-Amritsar-Chandigarh, Nagpur-Mumbai, Mumbai-Pune-Hyderabad, Chennai-Bengaluru-Mysuru and Varanasi-Patna-Kolkata. “Of this, the DPR of Delhi-Varanasi has already been submitted,” said Uke.On Wednesday, the survey will be conducted between 7am and 12 noon. The aircraft will land at Akola after the survey as due to Covid-19 restrictions the plane was not allowed to land at Nagpur airport. On benefits, Uke said, “The high-speed rail (HSR) project apart from being a technological marvel, would afford many quantifiable benefits like saving travel time, vehicle operation cost, reduction in pollution and accidents, job creation and would also boost the infrastructure and add to the growth.” THE MUMAI-NAGPUR HSR ROUTE* Length: 741 km* Type: Elevated* Stations: 12* Names: Shahapur, Igatpuri, Nasik, Shirdi, Aurangabad, Jalna, Mehkar, Malegaon Jahangir, Karanja Lad, Pulgaon, Wardha and Nagpur* Route Description: The proposed corridor is planned to run along Samruddhi Mahamarg Expressway, national highways, greenfield areas, and may pass through arterial roads of the intermediate city road network for high-speed rail connectivity between different cities along the corridor* Fares: The fare structure is yet to be finalized but is expected to be 1.5 times the existing AC-I fare on the Indian Railways’ current service||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/high-speed-rail-team-to-conduct-survey-in-nagpur-division-today/articleshow/81537993.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The stretch, located adjacent to the Masab Tank main road, is home to rows of residential properties and commercial establishments, apart from banquet halls. The citizen reporter, Venkat Reddy, who brought the issue to the notice of officials through TOI’s app said that the garbage has been left uncleared for the last 10 days. “I noticed that the garbage was left scattered on the road for at least 10 days,” said Reddy echoing the fear of other locals about such issues leading to rise in diseases in the area. “The place has become a garbage dumping point. When the garbage was not being removed, we feared that it would lead to vector-borne diseases,” said Abdul Aleem, a resident of Masab Tank. “Strays used to scatter the garbage all over the place. Mosquito menace and rancid smell were primary concerns,” he added. According to officials the garbage was removed from multiple places but people have started dumping waste there, again. “I had the waste removed from various places. But by the next day, garbage was piled up again,” said MK Ali, deputy commissioner, GHMC of Mehdipatnam. The garbage is piling up also because civic officials have removed the existing bins ahead of Swachh Survekshan Rankings 2021. This, as bins installed on roads carry negative marks in Swachh Survekshan. Municipal corporations that follow the bin-free city concept, by pressing into service vehicles to collect garbage from households will secure better rank as per Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.

The company said on Tuesday that it expects to commence production of Sputnik V at its facilities in Hyderabad from the third quarter of 2021, with deliveries estimated to start from the fourth quarter of 2021.  News of the tie-up sent the scrip of the company, which listed on Indian bourses in November 2020, soaring to a record high of Rs 2,784.45 a share on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Tuesday, before closing nearly 7% up at Rs 2,718.65 a share as compared to the previous day’s closing.“Under the terms of the agreement, Gland Pharma will first undertake technology transfer of the drug substance to its manufacturing facilities. After successful technology transfer, Gland Pharma will undertake manufacturing of the drug substance and drug product filling into vials under aseptic conditions,” it said in a regulatory filing. However, it was not clear whether the Sputnik V doses that Gland Pharma will churn out are meant solely for the Indian market or for global supplies as well. The pharma company, set up by PVN Raju in 1978 but now majority owned by Fosun Pharma of China, said it will be leveraging its expertise in manufacturing sterile injectables at scale for the production of Sputnik V and establishing a stable supply of Covid-19 vaccines. Gland Pharma said this is the first of multiple partnerships being explored by the company to leverage its manufacturing capacity and capabilities to support the global supply of Covid-19 vaccines. Sputnik V, which showed a 91.6% interim efficacy in global Phase 3 trials, has already applied to the Indian drug regulator for emergency use authorisation. At the end of February, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, which is conducting Phase II/III trials on 1,600 volunteers in India as part of a bridging study to larger global trials, was asked to submit safety and immunogenicity data. Dr Reddy’s Labs had joined hands with RDIF in September 2020 for clinical trials and distribution of 100 million doses of the vaccine in India. In November 2020, RDIF had tied up with Hyderabad-based Hetero Drugs to manufacture 100 million doses of Sputnik V.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hyderabads-gland-pharma-to-make-252-million-doses-of-sputnik-v/articleshow/81541091.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Visitors sitting in the open area and in children's park had to scurry for cover and rush outside the zoo to save themselves. The zoo was closed early on Tuesday in the wake of the sudden incidnet. The attack was the result of a visitor hurling a stone at a beehive in the children’s park. However, it could not be confirmed whether anyone suffered serious injuries due to the incident. Visitors sitting outside the state museum area and the ticket area were also caught in the situation. “As soon as the bees spread, we rushed all the visitors out and closed the premises. We had to use fogging and smoke to calm the bees down. The quick action helped us protect the visitors and the zoo inmates,” said zoo director RK Singh, adding that they will spot the beehives in the premises and find a permanent solution for it. Meanwhile, visitors were angry with the zoo authorities over the spoiled trip Aneesh Mishra, a visitor, said the zoo authorities should ensure that the bee hives are located far away from the park or parking lots. “It was risky and people, especially children and elderly, began running helter skelter. Luckily no damage was done,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bee-attack-stuns-visitors-to-zoo/articleshow/81539339.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

People said even after lodging complaints, Jal Sansthan failed to send water tanks. Meanwhile, the supply of foul-smelling contaminated water took place in a few localities, including Awas Vikas, Sadar Bhatti, Prakash Nagar, Chandra Nagar, parts of Dayalbagh and Kamla Nagar locality. The water supply in Old City areas is dependent on the Jeevani Mandi waterworks station, whereas nearly half of the city gets water supply from the Sikandra waterworks. Both the stations have not been working to their full capacity. Besides, thousands of litres of water in different parts of the city go to waste daily due to around 20 leakages in the water supply pipelines maintained by Jal Sansthan. According to an estimate, at least 50 million litres per day (MLD) water is wasted in the city due to pipeline leakages. So far, Jal Sansthan has no city-wide plan to check the situation. To fix the leakages, Jal Sansthan makes temporary arrangements that last only for a few days. Due to the damages in the supply pipeline, the water supply to two dozen localities — including Awas Vikas, Sikandra, Dayalbagh, trans Yamuna, Baluganj, Mantola, Subhas Bazaar, Transport Nagar, Kailash road, Balkeshwar Locality, Belanganj, Daresi, Rawatpara, Noori Darwaza, Shahganj, Madia Katra, Lohamandi, Idgha etc — were affected. Agra Jal Sansthan general manager RS Yadav said, “We are working to fix all the leakages. As the pipelines are too old and weak, they are unable to sustain the water pressure and getting leakages. We are working on the plan to lay new pipelines in areas with frequent leakages.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/pipeline-leakages-lead-to-shortage-of-water-supply-in-15-agra-localities/articleshow/81536979.cms||Deepak Lavania

To ease this situation, it has been decided that AMTS buses will not ply on Ellis Bridge. There were 144 AMTS buses that used to take the Nehru Bridge route. “Now, half of the buses will use Sardar Bridge, while the rest will use Gandhi Bridge,” said an AMC official. Nehru Bridge, which connects Ashram Road to Lal Darwaza, Relief Road, and walled city was closed to traffic for repair work from Sunday.However, with heavy traffic being diverted to Ellis Bridge, people have been experiencing hour-long jams especially between 10am and 12noon, then later between 5pm and 8pm. To prevent this, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and city traffic police on Monday conducted a meeting to address this issue. “We received several complaints of traffic jam on Ellis Bridge on Monday. After that, we discussed the issue with civic body officials and decided to keep AMTS buses away from Ellis Bridge,” said DCP (traffic) Tejas Patel. He added, “Five roads converge near Victoria garden. Traffic gets choked here. It also leads to traffic jams till Khamasa Circle. Flow of traffic near Town Hall circle on Ashram Road is also hampered. If AMTS buses are diverted to other bridges, then the traffic jam problem could be solved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-amts-buses-on-ellis-bridge/articleshow/81538051.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Must include farm, domestic workers in welfare board||It is heartening to see that the Telangana government has finally set up an Unorganised Sector Workers Welfare Board – an important institution required for protection of India’s largest pool of workers. Though the decision to constitute the board, on March 13, was taken only after insistence from the Telangana High Court and the composition of the board still remains questionable, one has to see it as a small step in the right direction. Within the first week of lockdown last year, it became clear that the worst hit section of society was going to be the unorganised workers. Soon after that it became clear that the number of people not covered under regular social protections was way higher than anyone had ever imagined. In Telangana, the number of pending ration card applications and cancelled ration cards ran into several lakhs. The government’s own estimates of migrant workers in Hyderabad swung wildly between three lakhs and seven lakhs. Lack of insurance scheme, provident fund, health care schemes, food and shelter security and lack of access to education destroyed countless households. The Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008 Act came into effect on May 16, 2009. The law was passed to protect nearly 39 crore workers – 90% of the total employment in India. The law, which was mainly designed to enable governments to design schemes and provide resources has never been taken seriously by any government. The lockdown and its disastrous consequences have come as a wake-up call -- the only way to protect unorganised workers is through a legally mandated welfare board. Under the act every state should constitute a state-level social security board to recommend social security schemes. The National Social Security board has recommended extension of RSBY (Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana), JBY (Janashree Bima Yojana) and Old age pension to certain categories of unorganised workers. Going forward, the government should strive to improve gender parity in the board and increase representation for scheduled castes. Women and scheduled castes constitute most of domestic work and in farm work sectors. There is an entirely new category of platform workers who need protection now. The board should proactively reach out to members of the civil society. Conventional trade unions cannot be expected to speak for the unorganised sector workers who are by definition not unionised in the conventional sense. The board should undertake its primary task - ensuring that unorganised sector workers are made visible to the state as workers entitled to benefits. This can only be done through registration. The board should also reach out to diverse sets of actors for outreach to register workers in all the districts. The funds that are earmarked for the welfare of these workers should be handled with utmost transparency. The next hearing on a public interest petition – that led to the constitution of the board -- is set to be heard by a bench headed by the Chief Justice of the High Court on March 18.

---||Dehradun||Chipko rerun: Women in Uttarakhand's Bageshwar hug trees to stop felling||DEHRADUN: In a protest reminiscent of the Chipko movement of the 1970s, hundreds of women of Jakhni village in Bageshwar on Tuesday hugged around 500 trees in a forest, saying they will kill themselves if the trees are chopped.  These full-grown and valuable trees in the forest, like Banj oak and rhododendron which are endemic to Uttarakhand, are set to be cut for a road proposed in the village. The protesters, including girls as young as eight, said the road isn’t needed and cutting the trees would aggravate the problem of water scarcity in the area. They said they have planned a second and bigger demonstration on Wednesday. “We don’t need the proposed Kamedi devi-Rangthara-Majgaon-Chonala road, which would be built at the cost of 500 trees. Our village already has a severe water shortage and chopping these many trees will make it worse. Also, all 600-odd villagers of Jakhni depend upon forest produce for their livelihood. How will we survive once the forest is gone?” said 56-year-old Kamla Devi, sarpanch of Jakhni van panchayat. The forest, 1.5km long and 8km wide, was grown on private land by villagers of Jakhni generations ago. A part of the forest is, in fact, regarded sacred by villagers and is dedicated to the local forest deity. They don’t pluck flowers or leaves from the trees there. “This forest was built by our ancestors. It has since developed a rich biodiversity. Razing it would leave many wild animals like leopards and several species of deer at the mercy of poachers. Not to mention it would increase man-animal conflict,” Devi said. When contacted, divisional forest officer (DFO) of Bageshwar BS Shahi said, “We have marked only 43 trees for felling in that forest.” Hemwant Singh Mehta, a villager and social worker from Jakhni, contended that in the forest department’s records, only 43 trees are marked to be chopped as not all trees count. “As per the forest department’s definition, only the trees with a girth of at least 20 cm are tagged as trees. Trees with smaller diameters aren't even counted.” Mehta also explained that the existing 6km-long road on the Kamedi Devi-Ranthara-Seri-Dhantola-Jakhni-Chonala route suffices for the needs of the villagers. The proposed road will carve out an alternate route to connect Manjhgaon (a village close to Ranthara) and Chanola. It will go through Dhantola and Jakhni and cut the distance to 4km. “Manjhgaon is already connected to the main road, why is a road needed to connect it to Chanola? That too, at the cost of trees, cutting which will inflict severe environmental damage,” Mehta said. Bageshwar SDM Rakesh Tiwari said, “An inquiry has been initiated into the matter. We have asked the PWD to check if the road is indeed needed. We have already cleared a 1.5km stretch. Findings of the inquiry will decide if we will raze the rest of the demarcated area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/chipko-rerun-hundreds-of-women-in-bageshwar-hug-500-trees-to-stop-them-from-being-felled/articleshow/81536997.cms||Shivani Azad

SRM College's decision to bat first after winning the toss proved to be a disaster as Shia PG College thrashed their bowlers to post a colossal total of 233 runs. Shaad Khan made a blistering attack by hitting 110 runs off just 53 balls. While chasing the target, SRM College collapsed before the lethal bowling of Syed Murtaza Hasan who claimed 6 wickets to bundle out SRM on a paltry score of 41 runs. Hasan was adjudged as the man of the match. In another match, BSNV College decided to bat first after winning the toss, but could only manage to score 57 runs. Mumtaz College easily chased the target as its batsmen played handsomely. Shashank Verma of Mumtaz College was declared the man of the match for his stupendous bowling effort.

The monitoring is so meticulous that any increase in daily sales over 30% vis-à-vis the same day in previous years, is under the strict scrutiny of the commission. Any abnormal increase in sales of Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) or beer in the state will have to be explained to the commission by excise department officials, as the daily figures and the corresponding day’s figures last year are produced before EC. The commission has instructed that the offtake of IMFL and beer from the central stocks (Bevco warehouses in the state) should also be watched and if there are major deviations, then a follow up trail on such offtakes should be launched. Based on the commission’s instructions, the excise department has also put major stock points on video surveillance, and daily receipt and offtake by retail sellers are being monitored. The interstate movement of vehicles are also put under surveillance by the excise in coordination with the transport department, as Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry that share major borders with the state are also going to polls, increasing the possibility of illegal liquor transport across the borders. On March 9, senior excise officials from Tamil Nadu had visited the state and had held discussions with excise commissioner S Ananthakrishnan, for coordinating the joint operations between both the states. There are several routes between the two states beyond the known main routes, through which such illegal transport is possible. Excise is equally vigilant on the transport of liquor across the border from Mahe to Kannur and Kozhikode districts, as Mahe being part of Pondicherry, is a major centre for IMFL purchase for people from both the districts. District and state nodal officers have been appointed by the excise department to keep track of progress in enforcement activities and report the matter on a day-to-day basis to the commission. The excise department has also embarked on a special drive that will focus on all districts sharing borders with other states and all the forest areas, where illegal liquor brewing is common. The focus will also be on high-end vehicles, including cars and other transport vehicles in addition to lorries and buses, which are likely to be used for transporting spirit to the state for manufacturing illicit liquor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/extra-vigil-over-liquor-sales-and-production-in-the-state/articleshow/81537064.cms||KP Saikiran

The accused was identified as Ramya (33), a native of Venginissery in Thrissur. She was supposed to fly to Bahrain in an Air India Express flight at 9am. She was intercepted by the CISF during the security check at the departure hall of the international terminal after being suspicious. Sources said that on frisking it was found hashish was concealed beneath her dress. CISF later informed Ernakulam rural police and handover the accused and the contraband to them. Police later recorded her arrest after registering a case under the NDPS Act. District police chief (Ernakulam rural), K Karthick, said that a detailed investigation would be conducted and police were looking into the whereabouts of the woman. Police will check if she had smuggled out ganja or hashish in the same manner. Police said women too are now used as drug peddlers and smugglers and the incident is the latest proof. Nedumbassery sub-inspector C P Binoy, ASI Bijesh, civil police officers P V Joseph, Rashmi P and Krishnan are part of the investigation team. CISF and police will strengthen the surveillance to prevent smuggling of drugs. Earlier this week, police had seized around 4kg of banned chewable tobacco from several persons from the surroundings of the airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cisf-nabs-woman-with-1-2kg-hashish-at-airport/articleshow/81537002.cms||---

Tope's visit comes a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with chief ministers to review the Covid19 situation and progress on immunisation. The Union government has been critical about the surge in Maharashtra and the slow pace of inoculation in the state. Tope said the state will need 2.2 crore doses to immunise all who are eligible in the second phase. The number is around 1.77 crore, of which over 31 lakh have got at least one dose. “We need a supply of 2.2 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the next three-and-a-half months. And, if this supply is done in a staggered manner, the Centre should give 20 lakh doses to the state each week,” said Tope. In the past few days, hospitals in Pune and Thane have faced shortage of Covishield, owing to which some slowed down the drive. Tope also sought consent to take inoculation to 367 public and private hospitals in the state; 209 are currently part of the drive. The state sought relaxations in norms – under the rules, only a 100-bed hospital can be an immunisation centre; Tope urged that the rule be relaxed to 50 beds, given the negligible cases of adverse reactions after vaccination. Officials said access to vaccines for all was discussed by Tope and Harsh Vardhan. The state completed dispensing 30 lakh shots of the vaccine on Monday. The country as a whole has touched nearly 3.3 crore immunisation shots. Daily vaccination numbers in the state touched 2.64lakh on Tuesday, which included 1.64 lakh seniors, 33,935 above 45 years with comorbidities, 31,674 health workers and 34,389 frontline staff. Mumbai has vaccinated the most in districts (6.48 lakh) followed by Pune (3.59 lakh) and Thane (2.42 lakh). Nagpur, experiencing a huge surge, has vaccinated 1.87 lakh. In Mumbai, vaccination numbers at 42,534 were stagnant, second day in a row; 1,835 took Covaxin and 40,699 Covishield. 89 centres are part of the drive and two more will join on Wednesday.

---||Chandigarh||UT administration seeks report on constructions outside lal dora||CHANDIGARH: The administration has sought a detailed report from the estate office on constructions outside lal dora in UT villages. The move comes after UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, in a recent meeting, had directed senior officials to work on regularisation of such constructions. The lal dora (red line) separates village habitation from adjacent agricultural land. After the UT administrator’s instructions, some villagers had started carrying out fresh constructions outside lal dora, hoping those would be regularized. However, the teams of UT estate office and land acquisition department had demolished them. Political parties and village residents have been consistently asking for the extension of lal dora and regularisation of constructions outside it. But, the architects and the city’s heritage conservationists are demanding that these illegal constructions should be removed to protect the city’s character. In the past, the UT estate office had even issued notices on constructions outside lal dora in villages. The UT had issued a notification and even clarified that the area outside the aabadi area of recently merged 13 villages will continue to be controlled by the Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952, as applicable to union territory of Chandigarh. The UT urban planning department too has consistently flagged the large-scale illegal construction and colonisation in villages of Chandigarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-seeks-report-on-constructions-outside-lal-dora-in-villages/articleshow/81537027.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra health minister lobbies with Union govt, seeks 20 lakh doses per week now||MUMBAI: State public health minister Rajesh Tope met Union health minister Harsh Vardhan in Delhi on Tuesday to seek more vaccine doses and decentralisation of the vaccination drive. Tope's visit comes a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with chief ministers to review the Covid19 situation and progress on immunisation. The Union government has been critical about the surge in Maharashtra and the slow pace of inoculation in the state. Tope said the state will need 2.2 crore doses to immunise all who are eligible in the second phase. The number is around 1.77 crore, of which over 31 lakh have got at least one dose. “We need a supply of 2.2 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the next three-and-a-half months. And, if this supply is done in a staggered manner, the Centre should give 20 lakh doses to the state each week,” said Tope. In the past few days, hospitals in Pune and Thane have faced shortage of Covishield, owing to which some slowed down the drive. Tope also sought consent to take inoculation to 367 public and private hospitals in the state; 209 are currently part of the drive. The state sought relaxations in norms – under the rules, only a 100-bed hospital can be an immunisation centre; Tope urged that the rule be relaxed to 50 beds, given the negligible cases of adverse reactions after vaccination. Officials said access to vaccines for all was discussed by Tope and Harsh Vardhan. The state completed dispensing 30 lakh shots of the vaccine on Monday. The country as a whole has touched nearly 3.3 crore immunisation shots. Daily vaccination numbers in the state touched 2.64lakh on Tuesday, which included 1.64 lakh seniors, 33,935 above 45 years with comorbidities, 31,674 health workers and 34,389 frontline staff. Mumbai has vaccinated the most in districts (6.48 lakh) followed by Pune (3.59 lakh) and Thane (2.42 lakh). Nagpur, experiencing a huge surge, has vaccinated 1.87 lakh. In Mumbai, vaccination numbers at 42,534 were stagnant, second day in a row; 1,835 took Covaxin and 40,699 Covishield. 89 centres are part of the drive and two more will join on Wednesday. Around 24 civic hospitals vaccinated 25,492, while 58 private facilities gave out 14,792 shots. Mumbai has vaccinated 6.90lakh with at least one dose of the intended 30lakh from prioritized groups. Ten minor cases of adverse events following immunisation were registered among Covishield recipients.

The board officials have started the process of auction of 110 residential properties. After completing the process of auction of 110 residential (freehold) properties, the board will start the auction process of 150 commercial (leasehold) and 11 residential (leasehold) properties next month. The properties will be auctioned through e-tendering only, said an official. The CHB had recently reduced reserved price of these properties by 10 per cent to 20 per cent. The CHB’s proposal was also approved by the Chandigarh administration recently. The reserve price was reduced by 10 per cent to 20 per cent after witnessing poor response to CHB’s attempt to auction properties last year. These 270 properties are in sectors 51, 63, 38 (west), 39, and Manimajra. Among the properties, 51 new flats, which were a part of the CHB’s costliest housing scheme in the city till now, will also be put up for auction. Besides, the commercial properties are also located in Manimajra, sectors 51, 61 and Maloya. A senior board official said these properties were lying vacant from last many years and their condition was deteriorating as well. As CHB failed to auction these properties over the years, the decision was taken to auction these properties in a phased manner. After registration with the CHB, interested people will have 10 to 15 days’ time to place their bid for the auction. For auction of the properties, the board has fixed the reserve price of HIG flat (leasehold) in Sector 39 at Rs 1.05 crore. Similarly, the reserve price of a three-bedroom flat (freehold) in Sector 63 has been fixed at Rs 86.24 lakh, two-bedroom flat in Sector 51 has been fixed between Rs 81 lakh and Rs 84 lakh. The reserve price of one-bedroom flat has been fixed at Rs 39.38 lakh and EWS flat at Rs 24.35 lakh in Sector 49. Similarly, the reserve price of a two-bedroom flat in Sector 49 has been fixed between Rs 69.87 lakh and Rs 71.26 lakh, keeping in view the location of the flat. The reserve price of a two-bedroom flat in Sector 63 has been fixed at 67.30 lakh. The reserve price of an HIG flat (leasehold) in Sector 45-A has been fixed at Rs 1.07 crore.

The Mohali administration is now mulling to establish 100-bed isolation-cum-treatment centre at Chandigarh University complex in Gharuan. Additional deputy commissioner (ADC) Asshika Jain held an emergency meeting with the representatives of various hospitals on Tuesday and directed them not to overcharge patients and also submit status of critical patients daily. The meeting was held with the representatives of all the leading hospitals in the district, including Fortis, Max, Indus, IVY, Mayo, Gracian, Amar, Amcare, Mehar, Shalby, Ace Heart and Vascular Institute and Sohana Hospital among others. The ADC said, “The recent spurt in the Covid-19 cases prompts us to gear up in managing the increasing number of patients and chalk out a strategy and that the public as well as private hospitals will work in tandem in the treatment of patients. We have directed the hospitals to ramp up Level 2 and 3 bed capacity and postpone elective surgeries as far as possible to dedicate requisite resources towards treatment of Covid-19 patients.” She said the hospital administrations have also been told to update the health status of critical patients daily so that all available resources may be pooled in to contain the case fatality rate (CFR). “They have been suggested to take assistance and advice from Dr K K Talwar, advisor, health, Punjab, by joining him through video-conference slated for 7.30 pm daily, if the need be,” she said. Further, they have been directed to avoid overcharging and adhere strictly to the designated rates. They have also been told to update the occupancy and vacancy numbers of L2 and L3 beds, including ICUs and ventilators, to the district nodal officer daily. In the meanwhile, the district and sub-divisional government hospitals and community health centres (CHCs) have also been directed to create room for L2 patients. The L1 facility created earlier at Gharuan during the breakout of the pandemic is also being revived to isolate patients, who do not have requisite space for home quarantine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/adc-dont-overcharge-update-status-of-critical-patients-daily/articleshow/81537009.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They are waiting to get permanent jobs. If the government is really sensitive, safai workers will not have to enter manholes. Not a single rupee has been allotted for machines to clean drains,” Mevani said. Stating that the budget had not included urban employment guarantee act, Mevani added, “According to a report by Centre for MonitoringIndian Economy (CMIE), 13 crore persons lost their jobs during the lockdown and about 3 crore are still jobless. Assuming that 10 per cent of these are in Gujarat, there are between 15 lakh and 20 lakh persons in the state who have lost their jobs because of the lockdown.” Commenting on the Rs 560-crore budget for MNREGA scheme, Mevani said that if the amount is divided between 560 talukas of Gujarat, each taluka will get just about Rs 2.25-crore fund.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mevani-attacks-govt-over-jobs/articleshow/81538139.cms||---

---||Kochi||Corp makes digital passes must for water distribution||Thiruvananthapuram: As demand for water supply increases in the wake of severe drought, the city corporation has made digital passes mandatory under the web-based water distribution system to ensure that water is collected from authorized vending points. The passes have been strictly mandated for water tankers transporting water to panchayat areas in the district. Mayor Arya Rajendran convened a meeting of corporation officials here on Tuesday in the wake of reports that some drivers of water tankers were misusing manual passes while carrying water to panchayat areas. As per the system, a one-time registration and licensing was introduced for owners of water tankers. Using the web-based system, different types of booking can be opted depending on whether a customer wants KWA or private tankers. KWA tankers were also enrolled into the system and one-time registration fee for tankers will be levied at the time of issuance of license. Once the booking is made, priority-based passes will be issued by the corporation via mobile app.  The digital passes will be issued at the filling station once drivers scan the QR code. An OTP will be send to the customer and when it is shared at the destination, delivery will be recorded as completed. The operator will also take photos of water tankers collecting water from authorized filling stations and users will be able to track the tankers from the moment the booking is made. Corporation officials said that there were instances where drivers did not take digital passes and used manual passes to collect water from unauthorized sources. “These kind of actions compromised the quality of water being distributed. Digital passes can be scanned only at authorized vending points of KWA and quality of water can be ensured. With demand for water increasing in panchayat areas affected by drought, drivers make use of manual passes to source water from different water bodies and this will disrupt the system,” an official added. It has also been decided to increase the vending points in the city. In addition to water collection points at Aruvikkara and PTP Nagar, new vending points will begin functioning at Vellayambalam, observatory and Vandithadom. Mayor said that people can book for water distribution using the Smart Trivandrum mobile app and people can avoid depending on intermediaries for water distribution. The city corporation has recently decided to levy additional charge for distance above 30km for distribution of drinking water in the wake of soaring fuel price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-makes-digital-passes-must-for-water-distribution/articleshow/81537050.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While some officials are in favour of night curfew on the pattern of Mohali and other districts of Punjab, a few are against it. UT administrator VP Singh Badnore will take the final decision.

They should not be asked to stand in queues, some arrangements should be made for sitting in hall and taking rest after vaccination, it was stressed.

But barely had they understood what was happening, there was more shock for them. The woman’s brother ran behind her and repeatedly dealt her nearly eight to 10 stabs with a knife, in full public view, till she died on the spot. The assailant Premsang Tank did not escape after killing his 22-year-old sister Reena, but walked around the area and the body, screaming, “I have killed my sister, I am not afraid of anyone.” When people told him to stay there till police came, he readily agreed and said he was not going anywhere. Ultimately, Tank surrendered. Preliminary investigation revealed that Tank had killed Reena because she had an affair. The video of Tank walking around his sister’s body and brandishing the knife, recorded by the neighbours, started doing the rounds on social media. Police said Reena had separated from her husband after a few years of marriage. She started living one with Bhavan Jogi in Maruti Nagar area of the coastal town. Moreover, Jogi had been acquitted in the murder of Reena’s father Narubha who was killed in 2014. In fact, the siblings’ mother was also an accused in this case. Her brother lived in the adjoining Mafatnagar area. Saurabh Singh, superintendent of police, Kutch (west), told TOI, “According to preliminary investigation, Tank got frustrated as some people kept passing remarks about his sister’s character. It looks like he suddenly flew into rage and killed her.” J N Panchal, deputy SP, Bhuj said, “There were three accused in the murder but all were acquitted in the case. Tank’s mother was living with him.” M B Jani police inspector of Mundra police station said, “The accused has surrendered himself and we also recovered murder weapon. We are investigating the exact motive of murder.” The accused Premsang was working as construction labour and he had a short temper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-kills-his-sister-on-road-in-kutch-surrenders-to-cops/articleshow/81537049.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The TOI visited the exam centre at Industrial Area, Phase I, Chandigarh, around noon. As students came out in large numbers, each one of them found the mathematics tough. “If we talk about mathematics, it was tough due to which the paper seemed lengthy.

---||Bareilly||Row over Quran's verses: Dumped by kin, cut off by community, Waseem Rizvi has only cops for company||BAREILLY: Ditched by family, ostracized by his community and censured by a string of senior BJP leaders and those from other political parties, former chairperson of Shia Waqf board Waseem Rizvi is increasingly finding himself isolated and hated, with just a bunch of policemen around him. He is under Y -category security and in an undisclosed location. This came after Rizvi recently filed a petition in the Supreme Court demanding removal of 26 verses from the Quran, Old Lucknow’s iconic Bara Imambara hosted a massive protest in which people and religious heads from both Sunni and Shia sects took part and announced ostracism of Rizvi from the Muslim community. The call to ‘Tahaffuz-e-Quran’ (in protection of the Quran) was given by Majlis-e-Ulama-e-Hind general secretary Maulana Kalbe Jawad. The clerics also said that Rizvi will not find a burial space in any graveyard of the country, a rare decision reserved for the likes of Pakistani terrorist Ajmal Kasab. On Sunday, a group of people barged into Lucknow’s Talkatora Karbala and destroyed the structure of a grave -- called ‘Hayati qabr’-- which Rizvi had booked in advance for himself. Rizvi has now issued a video statement from hiding claiming that his wife, children, brother and relatives have “ditched” him. But he remained unfazed. “I don’t care. I am on the right path and will fight this battle till the last breath. I will commit suicide (sic) but will not give up,” Rizvi is heard saying in the video. On Tuesday, the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) said it was a “well-thought conspiracy to disturb communal harmony.” It issued a notice to Rizvi for his statements against the Quran, asking him to tender an unconditional apology within 21 days. BJP, too, slammed Rizvi’s move. Senior party leader Shahnawaz Hussain said on Tuesday that his party was “firmly against” those who insult religious texts. “I strongly object and condemn Wasim Rizvi’s petition seeking removal of 26 verses from the Quran. It is my party’s stand that saying absurd things about any religious texts, including the Quran, are highly condemnable,” Hussain said. “The BJP is not in favour of any changes to any verses of the Quran or any other religious texts.” A prominent local lawyer of Moradabad went to the extent of announcing a bounty of Rs 11lakh for Rizvi's head. Amirul Hasan Jafri, former chairperson of Moradabad’s bar association, was later booked by local police. Scores of police complaints have been filed against Rizvi across India. Of them two have been turned into FIRs, in Bareilly and in Hyderabad. Prominent Islamic seminary Darul Uloom, Deoband, condemned Rizvi. Its vice-chancellor Abul Qasmi Nomani said, “An enemy of Islam has filed the petition in the Supreme Court. Darul Uloom strongly condemns it. These people want to disturb the peace and unity of the country. The government should take strict legal action.” Clerics of Barelvi school of thought have demanded NSA against him. National vice-president of Jamat-Raza-e-Mustafa, Salman Hasan Khan, said, “He has hurt the sentiments of millions of Muslims. It is a deliberate attempt by him to disturb peace. The National Security Act (NSA) should be invoked against him. He should be sent to jail. He is a threat to society.” Jawad, the Shia cleric, said "everyone is hurt and angry". He added: “Rizvi is trying to appease the ruling party as he is facing several cases of corruption. A few days ago he had gone on a tour to Nepal where he met people from Pakistan and China. A high-level probe should be ordered to find out why." Rizvi is not new to controversies. In 2019, he had written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him to shut all madrasas in the country as they "promote terrorism”.

---||Chandigarh||Mohali ISBT investors’ body seeks CBI probe||MOHALI: The C&C Mohali Junction Clients’ Association has sought a CBI inquiry into the alleged investment scam of Rs 490 crore at Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Inter State Bus Terminus (ISBT) in Mohali. The clients’ association has filed a petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court, alleging shoddy investigations by the police in the case of cheating by the C&C Company. The HC has issued a notice of motion to the police and adjourned the case for July 26. Harbhajan Singh Jolly, president of the association, said the petitioners have submitted that they, along with about 400 innocent buyers, had invested in the project for purchase of retail shops and commercial spaces and about Rs 490 crore were collected by M/s C&C Towers Limited, which was a subsidiary of M/s C&C Constructions Limited. Though the construction was to be completed by 2011, said Harbhajan, it did not start and the petitioners and other investors were left in the lurch after having invested huge amounts. He said directors and other office-bearers of M/s C&C Constructions Limited and the special purpose company (SPC) created by it defrauded the investors of about Rs 490 crore. Harbhajan said, “We have submitted that though several FIRs were registered against the companies and its directors, the police have not conducted a fair investigation and have virtually given them a clean chit. As per the inquiry report, directors of the parent defaulting company, namely Amritpal Singh Chadha and Rajbir Singh, have no concern with the SPC of M/s C&C Towers Limited. Even Col CVS Sehgal, chief general manager of the company, was declared innocent in the inquiry report.” The petitioners have submitted that even Gurjeet Singh Johar, chairman of the defaulting company, and Charanvir Singh Sethi, whose anticipatory bail applications had been dismissed, were given undue favours by the police. Despite dismissal of their bail applications, they were released on personal bonds, it was alleged. The counsel for the association said a biased investigation was conducted and the real culprits were not being taken to task and in such circumstances, the probe should be handed over to some independent agency like the CBI. In December 2019, the Mohali police had arrested from Delhi Sanjay Gupta, one of the directors of C&C Company that was to construct, maintain and operate Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Inter State Bus Terminus in Mohali. Police had issued a lookout circular against the chairman and directors of the C&C Company in February 2019. State-of-the-art air-conditioned Baba Banda Singh Bahadur ISBT in Mohali, an ambitious project of the former SAD government and deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal, was inaugurated in 2016 after which it ran into rough weather. C&C Company abandoned construction, maintenance and operations, after which the investors lodged a complaint with the police. FIRs were registered against the chairman and directors at Phase-I police station under sections 406, 420 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in August 2018. Another FIR was filed in January 2019. The PSPCL had, in December 2017, snapped the power supply to the terminus as the company had failed to pay the pending bills of Rs 2.4 lakh. HC had quashed directors’ petition The chairman and directors of the Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Interstate Terminus in Mohali were penalised Rs 2 lakh for delay in handing over possession of commercial complexes to the investors. The high court, while quashing the petition filed by the chairman and directors for relief, had directed them to deposit the penalty with PGI’s poor patients’ welfare fund in January 2021. The chairman and directors had approached the HC for quashing of the State Consumer Disputes’ Redressal Commission orders to penalise the company. They had taken the plea that the company was already under a corporate insolvency resolution process. Upholding the judgement of the commission, the HC had ordered them to deposit the penalty. Gmada’s Rs 89cr claim The National Company Law Tribunal’s special bench, Chandigarh, had last year initiated the corporate insolvency resolution process of C&C Towers Ltd, which has to date failed to pay the default money. Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (Gmada) has also sought a claim of Rs 89 crore from the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-isbt-investors-body-seeks-cbi-probe/articleshow/81537030.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B on Tuesday announced that all standalone shops dealing with essential commodities – except medical shops – can operate only till 1pm. Vegetable and fruit cart vendors will also be allowed to operate in the day, a notification from the municipal commissioner said.Owing to the spike in novel coronavirus cases, district guardian minister Nitin Raut had imposed a weeklong lockdown in the city and district from March 15 to 21. However, essential services such as standalone grocery shops, vegetable and fruit shops, meat shops, milk booths etc were allowed to transact business till 9pm.Police commissioner Amitesh Kumar on Monday suggested modification in curbs. According to him, essential shops should be allowed to operate from 12noon to 4pm, so that the combined numbers of office-goers and shoppers does not crowd the city roads during morning hours.“Our objective was to ensure that office-goers and purchasers do not step out in the common time space. The latest order will be challenging for us to control the crowd of office-goers and purchasers in the same hours, but we shall revise our plans accordingly, to ensure the rush is controlled and managed,” he said. The CP had also requested the civic body to allow teachers to work from home, discontinue construction activities and institute checks on attendances at private premises. Apart from the timing of essential outlets, decision on other suggestions from police to NMC is yet to be taken.“NMC reviewed day one of the lockdown and found that many people were venturing out without a valid reason. Most gave lame excuse of going to markets to purchase vegetables or grocery items, which needed to be curtailed,” Kumar said. “So we decided to further tighten the guidelines of weeklong lockdown,” the civic chief added.Radhakrishnan also urged people to strictly follow lockdown and Covid-appropriate norms.Citizens said the amendment will defeat the purpose of weeklong lockdown. Tejinder Singh Renu, secretary, Vidarbha Taxpayers Association, said, “With positive cases rising sharply in Nagpur, our responsible civic chief is taking all necessary steps to ensure furthermore spread by keeping citizens indoors. However, restricting essential commodities shop timings till 1pm will probably increase crowding as most citizens will reach shops during the limited time of 3-4 hours. This may defeat distancing norms.”“To my knowledge, most of the cases reported in the city are asymptomatic. We need to find more about its viral load and if this Covid strain is not so destructive, and relax and plan lockdowns accordingly,” Renu said. “If we create more panic, it could trigger migration issues and the economy plunging beyond repair,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/strict-norms-get-stricter-all-shops-to-shut-at-1pm/articleshow/81538223.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

After the lapse was noticed, the drive was halted and beneficiaries were told to return later, while few centres were shut on Tuesday, and staff were called for reorientation sessions. Vasudevan A, a resident of Khopat, who witnessed the confusion and avoided taking the jab said, “Few recipients were told they were given Covaxin dose, while the mobile message they received showed Covishield, which was risky. When they questioned the staff, they realised the folly and immediately halted the process, and requested us to come later,” he said. Staff admitted the lapse but claimed they kept tabs on those administered a different vaccine. “We ran out of vaccines, so we ordered a fresh batch, but were unaware it was of a different make,” a staffer said. Deputy civic chief Sandeep Malvi denied the possibility of a wrong vaccine being administered but said he would look into it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbaithane-centres-give-vaccines-people-had-not-registered-for/articleshow/81538217.cms||Manoj Badgeri

---||Hyderabad||Thrown out of my comfort zone, I learnt to innovate||With the pandemic pushing us in to a space we had never lived through before, innovating on a continuous basis became the key to survival. For me too, it was a great learning experience. Since I am the admissions coordinator for my college, I had to bring an out-of-box idea to the table to attract aspirants and fill up our seats, amid the pandemic. With uncertainty looming large over the fate of the 2020-2021 academic session, I managed to coordinate and pull off a series of live panel discussions – like ‘Engineering Education-Match your Passion-Charting the Right Career choice’ -- emphasising the relevance of various branches of engineering offered to aspirants at our college. Though the idea pitched by me was supported by my senior level management, I did have my apprehensions right from the beginning. Not surprising then, on D-day when I the first live session – conceived by me -- was conducted, the turnout of audience members was very dull. That night, I was restless. I was also worried about the consequences of my actions. But then I received a message from one of my senior colleagues appreciating me for the idea and its execution. It boosted my confidence. But I also knew that I had to pull up my socks and do a better job the next time. I worked hard and completed the entire online series – making them more audience-friendly -- for several branches of engineering. In fact, I also got parents reaching out to us to enquire about some branches, after watching our panel discussions. I was thrilled. When I checked after that, I realised that the most viewed panel discussion video had 1,000 views. Suddenly my confidence grew ten-fold and I felt like my intuition had indeed worked. Beaming with pride, I went home and shared this with my daughter. She, of course, burst my bubble in no time. “Do you know how many views BTS videos ger?" she told me sarcastically, clearly indicating that my 1k wasn’t really an achievement. But then I am no BTS or online star. For me, those views were enough to help me discover Ikigai --- a Japanese concept meaning, a reason for being. It also made me go back to the quote which reads -- challenges do not make us strong or weak, they simply make us discover who we really are – and realise the truth of it.

---||Aurangabad||DGP’s visit to Aurangabad, Nanded postponed by a week||Aurangabad: Maharashtra director general of police Hemant Nagrale has ‘postponed’ his three-day-long maiden visit to Marathwada region at the last minute. Nagrale was scheduled to reach the region on Tuesday and his schedule was divided between Nanded and Aurangabad. The ongoing turmoil in Mumbai is being cited as the key reason for the last minute changes in the top cop’s programme. At least two senior police officers from the region, too, have cited the on-going developments in the Ambani Security Scare case in Mumbai as the reason for postponing the top cop’s visit. When reached out to DGP Nagrale, the 1987-batch IPS officer replied, “which could be true’. The top cop said that the visit has been postponed by a week’s period and he is expected to visit the region sometime around March 23. Already the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested Mumbai police’s crime intelligence unit’s assistant inspector Sachin Waze for ‘role in placing explosives-laden car’ near Mukesh Ambani’s house. The developments have forced the senior police officers from the state headquarters as well as the home department to keep a close tab on the developments. In addition to this, state police chief stepping out on an official tour amidst the turmoil would have space for the detractors to portray it in negatively. The police authorities in Aurangabad are of the view that the postponing the visit will be of some advantage to them. A senior officer said, “Though we were prepared for the crime review meeting, the postponing of the visit has given us another week’s time to prepare ourselves better.” Ahead of the visit, some of the police station premises were being cleaned while renovation was being carried out at other police stations. The postponement has also given a breather to police officers whose leaves were cancelled due to the state police chief’s visit to the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/dgps-visit-to-aurangabad-nanded-postponed-by-a-week/articleshow/81536118.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The writ petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India by Sanjay Vishwakarma, brother of Girdhari, alias Kanhaiya Kumar, alias doctor, who was killed in an encounter on February 15, prayed for a direction to the state government to register an FIR against police. The court said an FIR has already been lodged, the Uttar Pradesh State Human Rights Commission has also taken cognizance of the incident and a retired high court judge has been appointed as a single member commission with headquarters at Lucknow for inquiry within two months and hence the court is not inclined to entertain this petition and thereby dismisses it. The Supreme Court further said these authorities can take the assistance of Central Bureau of Investigation or any other investigating agency if they find it necessary. The petition was filed in the Supreme Court after Girdhari, the main accused in the murder of history-sheeter Ajit Singh, was killed in an encounter in Lucknow early on February 15. Police said Kanhaiya tried to escape from police custody after snatching pistol of a sub-inspector while being taken to Khargapur in Gomtinagar where he had confessed to have hidden the pistol he used to eliminate Ajit Singh on January 6. Two SIs were also injured in the encounter. Earlier, on February 26, Lucknow chief judicial magistrate Sushil Kumari had directed Hazratganj police to lodge an FIR against DCP East Sanjeev Suman, SHO VIbhutikhand and other cops, but the decision was challenged in the high court and was stayed on March 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/goons-encounter-sc-says-no-to-fir-against-city-police/articleshow/81539436.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

At first, the family tried home remedy to treat the girl. As her condition started deteriorating, Ramdas decided to take his daughter to Paoni for treatment. However, the girl breathed her last even before they could reach Paoni.Meanwhile, nearly 75 others in the village from different age groups also complained of vomiting, fever, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. As reports about suspected mass food poisoning reached health department authorities, a team under district health officer Dr Prashant Uike and civil surgeon Dr Riyaz Farukhi reached the village and started making arrangements for patient care.Around 30 patients were rushed to Paoni rural health centre, while others were accommodated in a makeshift arrangement at Bhendala gram panchayat office.Dr Farukhi said most villagers are suffering from vomiting and stomach ache.Doctors at Paoni and Bhendala told TOI that most of the patients have very mild food poisoning symptoms. “The girl who died on Tuesday morning was severely dehydrated. She was vomiting since Monday and had become very weak. She died on way to the hospital,” said a doctor over phone.“Around 75 villagers are under treatment. I have directed officials to take samples of the food being sold at the stalls. Tests in laboratory will make everything clear,” said Bhandara collector Sandip Kadam, who visited the village on Tuesday.Bhandara district administration has taken serious note of the incident. This is second serious incident of health hazard in the district this year. In January, 10 newborns had died in NICU fire due to short-circuit at the Bhandara District General Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/food-poisoning-girl-dies-75-ill-in-bhandara-village/articleshow/81538236.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The victims came face to face with the tiger while working in a cane field. The condition of one of the injured is critical. Forest officials said it was an “accidental attack” as the tiger left the spot instead of dragging the injured person along. There are more than 10 tigers in the social forestry region in the district. For the past one year, there were no reports of tiger attacks in the region. In December 2019, a farmer was killed at Sundarpur village by a tiger. Samir Kumar, divisional forest officer, south Kheri forest division, said Bhagwandeen, 42, and Dhruv Kumar, 25, residents of neighbouring Ayodhyapur village, entered the field without realizing that a tiger had taken shelter amid the cane stalks. Suddenly the tiger pounced on Bhagwandeen and injured him even as Dhruv shouted for help. He was injured because of the sharp sugarcane leaves as he ran out of the field, he said. Kumar said tiger pugmarks were found in the field. Villagers have been advised to stay away from the field and work in groups, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/two-injured-in-a-tiger-attack-in-kheri/articleshow/81537060.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Eight health workers test +ve after 2nd vax dose, most have mild symptoms||MUMBAI: At least eight healthcare workers from different city hospitals have tested positive for Covid-19 after taking both doses of the vaccine. All are believed to have mild symptoms at present, although some have been hospitalised. Experts said such cases are not completely unexpected and underline that Covid-19 prevention practices cannot be junked post vaccination. Three healthcare workers who have tested positive after vaccination with double doses are currently undergoing treatment at SevenHills Hospital in Andheri (East). One of them, an intensivist, said he had taken the first dose of Covishield on January 20 and the second on February 24. Ten days after the second dose, he developed symptoms and tested positive for Covid-19. “This is the first time I have tested positive despite working in the ICU for the past one year,” he said, cautioning that even after vaccination one needs to wear masks and maintain distance. The doctor’s symptoms are mild at present. Parel’s KEM Hospital has registered a sole case of infection post complete vaccination with Covishield. Dr Gajanan Velhal, head of community medicine, said the faculty member tested positive about a week after taking the second dose. “The individual has a mild disease and is undergoing treatment at home. We haven’t heard of any other cases,” he said, adding such infections must be seen in the right perspective. “Coronavirus is an airborne disease and a vaccine can’t stop the infection. What it can do is prevent the infection from progressing to a disease, or preventing the disease from becoming critical,” he said. At SevenHills, none of the three infected after the second dose are serious. “We have three cases post second dose and almost a dozen infected people after the first dose. Most have a mild disease,” said Dr Maharudra Kumbhar, officer on special duty in SevenHills. “No vaccine has an efficacy of 100%, so some are bound to get the infection after taking vaccines. It has been seen world over,” he said. In case of both the vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, complete immunity kicks in at least 14 days after taking both the doses. Physician Dr Gautam Bhansali from Bombay Hospital has come across three cases where healthcare workers have tested positive on RT-PCR. “All got the infection after five to seven days of vaccination, but all were mild and treated at home,” he said. The intensivist from SevenHills Hospital said a mutation in the circulating strain could have caused the infection. Across Maharashtra, two health department officials from Jalna have tested positive after taking the second dose. A 48-year-old doctor from Jabalpur in MP too has tested positive. Infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava said there should be a serious analysis if more such cases are found post vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai8-health-workers-test-ve-after-2nd-vax-dose-most-have-mild-symptoms/articleshow/81538288.cms||Sumitra Debroy

In the meantime, the department has set up flying squads to find the defaulters in the matter. Anil Arora, president of Jaipur Transport Operators Association said, “We have requested the transport minister to extend the deadline for submitting the tax till March 31 as we have been facing heavy losses because of the pandemic. In neighbouring states, the deadline for submitting the tax has already been extended.

According to a wildlife veterinarian, time is running out as without the mother’s feed, the cubs may survive only for another two to three days. The tigress’ carcass was already over two days old when it was found. So, the cubs must be starving and weak. They are also at risk of being killed by a carnivore, he added.With a view to saving the cubs from dehydration, two water holes have been dug up around the spot where the carcass was found. Naveen Khandelwal, deputy director of PTR, said, “We have yet not succeeded in tracing the cubs. The field teams will continue combing round the clock in a bid to rescue them or till it is ascertained that they are the offspring of another tigress.” Dr BM Arora, wildlife veterinarian and president of the Association of Indian Zoo and Wildlife Veterinarians, said, “The two-month-old cubs can survive without mother’s feed for seven to eight days. The mother’s milk is rich in colostrum, boosts the immunity system of the cub, makes its digestive system strong and contributes to its healthy development”. If the cubs were not rescued within the next two-three days, their chances of survival would dip to zero in the absence of the mother feed or its substitute, he warned. The tigress is suspected to have died of infighting with a tiger, probably while trying to protect its cubs. Its autopsy report also did not indicate “anything unnatural”, said Khandelwal. Its canines, nails and skin were found to be intact without any internal injury. Besides, no snaring marks were detected, ruling out poaching, said Khandelwal. The forest authorities are now awaiting its pathology and toxicology report to find out if it was poisoned, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/ptr-staff-races-against-time-to-rescue-4-tiger-cubs/articleshow/81537075.cms||Keshav Agarwal

The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has already roped in an agency which has started a survey for demarcating the boundaries of Godavari river and its three tributaries. Shivkumar Vanjari, executive engineer (environment) of NMC, said, “Our objective is to make the rivers free from encroachment. Hence, there is a need to demarcate the boundaries of the river and its tributaries to remove the existing encroachments and curb the menace of such encroachments along the river in future.” “We have already completed surveying five of the total 19km -long stretch of Godavari river. We are expecting to complete the survey by December end,” said Vanjari. “The NMC will demarcate the boundaries and also chalk out red and blue lines of the Godavari and its three tributaries. We also have plans to demarcate all the 67 nullahs across the city to remove encroachments,” he added. Rajesh Pandit, an environmentalist and the petitioner in the Godavari river pollution case in the Bombay high court, welcomed the move of the civic administration. “Godavari is the lifeline of Nashik city and it should not only be made free of encroachments but pollution too.

Bhati said the government had announced to open around 116 government colleges, out of which 31 were announced this Budget session. “Our government is the first to open such a huge number of colleges. The requirement of faculty in these colleges will be fulfilled by contractual teachers and funds have been allotted to some colleges for construction,” said Bhati. Pointing at the political move of the then BJP government in 2014 that closed down 43 colleges opened during the time of the previous Ashok Gehlot government, Bhati said their government didn’t mix politics with education. “We let the 27 colleges to function that were opened in BJP’s tenure and supported them to cater to students in these colleges. Giving skill-based education to the students is our prime focus, to help them get employment after graduation. During the pandemic, we made the e-content of higher education syllabus under which 2,00,731 videos were uploaded on the internet,” said Bhati. He said the government has announced the opening of colleges in the name of martyrs and the help of Bhamashahs will be taken in infrastructure development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-is-keen-on-increasing-access-to-higher-education/articleshow/81538300.cms||---
---||Lucknow||How the city took on coronavirus challenge||The year 2020 saw the worst pandemic the world had seen in the past several decades. Like all other cities across the globe, Lucknow was caught on the wrong foot by the pandemic. By June 2020, migrant labourers and workers started returning from metros having high positivity. The district administration and the health department faced challenges of containment of the spread of infection and treatment of people infected by the disease. This was really a tough time for all of us. The health department had not seen anything this big and this severe. It was like walking on an extremely thin line where on one hand there was duty calling and on the other there was fear of exposing our families to the risk. Losing our colleagues to the disease was disheartening but we couldn’t step back and let the virus win. We took the Triple-T (Testing, Tracing and Treatment) approach with interdepartmental coordination under the leadership of district magistrate, IT support of the chief development officer and the medical know-how of the chief medical officer. Integrated Control and Command Centre (ICCC) was established based on the contemporary IT tools. The district started relying on aggressive testing and by the end of February 2021, Lucknow had done more than 18 lakh tests, which was highest in the state. Focussed and targeted testing approach was adopted during the festival season of Dussehra, Karvachauth, Deepawali and Chhath for people working in sweet shops, beauty parlours, electronic shops etc. Round-the-clock testing booths were set up at airports, railway stations and bus stations to test the travellers coming from high positivity areas of New Delhi and NCR. Hospitals and dialysis units were identified as point sources of infection and doctors and paramedics were tested in hospitals, nursing homes and clinics. The district started with tracing three to four contacts per positive case. By February 2021, the average contacts traced reached as high as 20 contacts per case, which resulted in a significant drop in the positivity. Help from Call Details Records (CDR) , LIU and police was taken to trace the contacts. Ground level work force on ASHA, ANM, Anganwadi workers were deployed to trace and test the contacts. In December, the district faced the scare of a new strain of virus originating in the United Kingdom. Lucknow negotiated the crisis with strict surveillance and aggressive testing. More than 350 international travellers were traced and tested along with their contacts and the spread of the more virulent strain of virus was prevented. Treatment of Covid positive patients was given prime importance. A team of doctors was deployed, round the clock to allocate covid facilities to the patients, depending on severity of the disease. Ambulance control room was set up in the ICCC and ambulances movement was monitored with GPS to minimise the response time. As the number of daily cases increased, more L2 and L3 beds were created at various government and private hospitals. District administration and health department ensured that the treatment protocols are strictly followed in both government and private hospitals. CCTV cameras were installed in the Covid wards and daily video calls were made to the Covid patients by the district officials. Special care was taken of home isolated cases. Daily video calls were made to home isolated patients by expert doctors to ensure their well being. Supply of drugs pulse oximeters and thermometers were ensured at the doorsteps of every home isolated patient. With these interventions, the positivity rate was brought down from 9.78% in September to 0.35% in February 2021. Average daily positive cases dropped from 852 in September 2020 to less than 20 in February 2021. Fatality of Covid deaths dropped from as high as 336 in September 2020 to merely 7 in February 2021. More than 18,000 patients were admitted in the hospitals and more than 63,000 patients were treated in home isolation. The recovery rate of Covid-19 positive cases in the district was 98.52% , which is one the highest in the country.

---||Nagpur||Retaining wall to stop soil erosion: Metro wants to fell 249 trees||Nagpur: A public notice informing about felling of over 400 fully grown trees in different parts of the city has shocked environment activists. Among the major felling are 249 trees at the premises of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) and 121 trees along the periphery of Futala lake for the construction of a retaining wall.As part of the procedure, the garden department of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) recently issued a public notice in a Marathi daily, calling out objections from the general public. Infuriated by the proposed large-scale loss of green cover, environment activists raised strong objections against both, felling of trees and the haste in calling for objections despite the lockdown.MahaMetro has sought permission to chop down 249 trees at Neeri to construct a parking area for Ajni Metro station. However, according to activists, alternate sites were not explored for the same which could save green cover.Apart from this, the agency wants to construct a retaining wall along the periphery of Futala lake, opposite the viewing gallery. “Our intention is to protect the existing wall and the water body,” said officials. The wall is planned to start from the lake and go up till the botanical garden.NMC officials added that the wall will prevent soil erosion which happens frequently as the road has a slope. They added that subabul and chichbilai trees will be cut and rest of the species will be saved. Activists countered that it was wrong to solve one environmental problem by giving rise to another one.“Trees prevent soil erosion and here they are being cut. No matter what species they are, every tree is important,” they said, adding that why were the authorities not paying heed towards collapsing heritage wall or leaking of lake. On Tuesday evening, activists Jaydeep Das, Shrikant Deshpande and Sandeep Pathe submitted a letter to Congress MLA Vikas Thakre, stating that they don’t support unnecessary felling of trees in the name of unsustainable development. “Secondly, the objections are sought in writing from citizens during lockdown. How can we be forced to come out of our homes?” the letter added.NMC officials said that citizens can email objections to gardendept.nmc@gmail.com.The public notice also mentioned other permissions taken for road construction near Gandhisagar Lake, construction of commercial complex at Kelibagh road and felling of trees at an individual residential property etc.TREE FELLINGNo of trees to be felled------- Who sought permission?----------- Purpose249 | Metro | Parking area at Neeri for Ajni Metro station121 | Metro | Retaining wall along Futala Lake15 | PVR Engineers and Contractors | New railway track between Itwari and Dighori railway stations11 | NMC | Construction of commercial complex at Kelibagh Road6 | Tehsil agriculture officer | Posing risk5 | NMC | Trees coming in the way of cement road between Gandhisagar Lake and Gitanjali Talkies2 | Vandana Raut | Obstructing compound wallMail objections to gardendept.nmc@gmail.com||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/retaining-wall-to-stop-soil-erosion-metro-wants-to-fell-249-trees/articleshow/81538286.cms||Manka Behl

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Seven years after dog bit child, owner gets six months jail||NAGPUR: Nearly seven years after a dog bit a nine-year-old child, a court of judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) on Monday awarded six months simple imprisonment to the pet’s owner. While convicting Dr Sangita Vijay Balkote, a resident of Shrikrushna Nagar in the city, for the offences punishable under Section 289 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) vide Section 248(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the JMFC court presided over by JD Jadhao also slapped a Rs50,000 fine on her. This amount would be handed over to the child’s mother Sonal Nandkumar Badkule, who had lodged a complaint under Section 357 of the CrPC. “Due to the negligent act of the accused, the victim’s life is in danger till date because of the infection from the dog’s bite. It may flare up at any time. Hence, considering the fact and nature of offences along with submission of the accused, awarding six months imprisonment would meet ends of justice,” the judge said. As per the Section 289, “whoever knowingly or negligently omits to take such order with any animal in his possession as is sufficient to guard against any probable danger to human life, or any probable danger of grievous hurt from such animal, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months”. As per the complainant, the incident dates back to June 29, 2014, when her son was walking with his friends on a road in front of their home at Nandanvan in morning hours. The accused’s pet dog along with another dog chased and bit him, that left him severely injured. He sustained bite injuries on the neck, shoulder and legs. Subsequently, an aggrieved Badkule lodged a complaint with Nandanvan police station. The investigations were carried out by head constable Mahadeo Korpe and others. On January 2, 2015, the accused was presented in the court for her testimony. Public prosecutor Mona Raut pleaded for the cops. While pronouncing the verdict, the JMFC warned that in default of payment of compensation, the accused would undergo further imprisonment for six months. “The bail bonds of the accused would be surrendered and all the sentences would run concurrently. The copy of this judgment be given to the accused free of cost,” the judge said. The doctor was also convicted under Section 338 of IPC, which states that “whoever causes grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life, or the personal safety of others, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to Rs 1,000, or with both”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/7-years-after-dog-bit-child-owner-gets-6-months-jail/articleshow/81538272.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

This included 21,000 tablets of alprazolam and 140 bottles of cough syrups, said drug inspector Prashant Brahmankar. These tablets were sold illegally on Malegaon streets by some suspects. Upon receiving information about it, the teams of Nashik FDA’s drugs department carried out eight raids along with the police, said Brahmankar. The menace of illegal sale of alprazolam is observed in Malegaon since the last few years. This scheduled anti-anxiety drug is consumed by a large section of people — mainly those working in powerlooms for a sound sleep in the night after working for hours together. This drug is supposedly consumed to ensure peaceful sleep after being exposed to huge sound pollution in powerlooms. The consumption of this drug is believed to soothe brain nerves and, thereby, calm a person. However, the consumption of these tablets reaches to a point of addiction to the extent that the concerned people who start with one tablet end up taking seven to eight tablets at a time. The action against sale ad consumption of this drug has been continuous by the FDA depending on the information they receive from the textile town. The concerned sellers are booked under sections of the Cosmetic and Drugs Act and the Indian Penal Code for illegal sale. FDA officials said that it is to be investigated from where the drugs are procured for illegal sale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-fda-seizes-anti-anxiety-drug-alprazolam-worth-rs-41k/articleshow/81536140.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Delhi||No woman SHO at any police station shocking: Delhi Commission for Women||NEW DELHI: Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) has raised concerns over reports stating that no police station in the capital has a woman station house officer (SHO). When all are working towards ensuring gender equality, such reports are very shocking, said a DCW official. On Tuesday, the commission wrote to Delhi Police, asking reasons for police stations having no female SHOs. It has sought a reply before March 19. “While there are already rules in place guaranteeing 33% reservation for women, women participation in the force remains to be particularly low,” said the official. DCW chief Swati Maliwal stated, “We have been informed that there are no women SHOs in any of the 178 police stations in Delhi. This is very shocking and disappointing at the same time. It is very important to ensure equal participation of women in the force. Areas like GB Road must have women SHOs. We have issued a notice to the police in the matter and sought answers to our concerns. We are taking this issue very seriously and will try to bring about a change.” The commission has also asked the police to submit a list of steps taken by them to increase the participation of female officers at higher levels. Details of male and female officers of rank of inspector, including their sanctioned and current numbers of posts, have also been sought. “The commission strongly believes that it is pertinent to increase participation of women in the police force,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-woman-sho-at-any-police-stn-shocking-dcw/articleshow/81538365.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Kidnapped at 7, ‘sold’ at 10 for Rs22L, MP girl rescued after 4 yrs||Nagpur: A 14-and-half year-old girl, rescued this week from a brothel in the city’s red light locality of Ganga Jamuna, was kidnapped at the age of seven and later ‘sold’ to the sex trade racketeers for Rs22 lakh. At the age of 10, she was made to entertain almost as many customers as her age and sometimes even more, against a payment of Rs50-60 per day at the brothel. Police efforts have ensured she will be meeting her family soon, after a gap of seven years. Her mother was reportedly shocked to see her daughter looking “much older than her age”, which, it was later understood, was an effect of the relentless administering of hormonal injections and feeding of high-protein powders and tablets at brothels to develop girls’ bodies faster, for them to be ready for multiple-partner sex. The racketeers also make the girls addicted to liquor and narcotics to ensure they are numbed to the pain. The victim, along with her younger sister — aged five — and an 8-year-old neighbour, were kidnapped in May 2014 from Dewas, Madhya Pradesh (MP). It’s learnt that the sisters, along with their friend, had stepped out of home, following their mother outside after their parents had a tiff. An unidentified couple had abducted the three children on a bike, on the pretext of taking them to their mother. Though an offence of kidnapping was registered, MP police had failed to trace the children. It was during an ‘operation Muskan’ drive, initiated to trace missing and kidnapped children, the police had learnt that a woman was rescued from remote Pander taluka in Bhilwada district of Rajasthan. Through the efforts of the MP police team comprising sub-inspector Rahul Patidar, assistant sub-inspectors Radheshyam Verma and Dhirajsingh Bais, head constable Shivkumar and women cops Sulochana and Meena, it was found that the younger sister of the girl rescued in Nagpur and their neighbour were rescued by the Rajasthan police from the racketeers in 2019 during ‘Operation Gudiya’, launched to rescue girls trapped in nefarious activities. The two girls were traced at a shelter home in Ajmer. After the rescue, the girls had recalled the names of their parents and state but could not reveal any more details, which had stalled their reunion with family.During the interaction with the two rescued girls, the whereabouts of the girl in Nagpur’s Ganga Jamuna came to the fore. The MP police team learnt that the girl found in Nagpur was shifted out of Rajasthan around four years ago and taken to Mumbai. She was brought to Ganga Jamuna from Mumbai.In the meantime, Lakadganj police received a tip-off about the Nagpur-based girl, following which a team of senior inspector Parag Pote and inspector Amita Jaipurkar, under zonal DCP Lohit Matani rescued her. The cops were surprised as she appeared to be looking starkly different from the picture of her young age shared by MP police. The girl had claimed to be “20-years-old” and a “mother of one”.Pote said the photograph of the rescued girl was sent to MP police and they showed it to her sister, their friend and the girl’s mother, who immediately identified her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kidnapped-at-7-sold-at-10-for-rs22l-mp-girl-rescued-after-4-yrs/articleshow/81538322.cms||Soumitra Bose

The guards also alleged that Arya is involved in corruption and said the protest would continue until he is removed from his post. The guards said the deceased prisoner was sent to Haridwar sub jail on March 5, but he died the very next day. The guards claimed that the family of the deceased filed an FIR against them under coercion from Arya. “Arya has pressured the inmates’ family to name us saying that he was beaten up in the jail. Moreover, he is also pressuring another prisoner to become a witness against us,” said Devendra Prasad, one of the protesters. However, speaking to the media, Arya denied the claims made by the protesters. “I have assumed the post just a few days back and the inmate was already dead before I took the charge. I am not aware of the allegations and I will continue to carry out my work as usual,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/guards-protest-against-haldwani-sub-jail-chief-claim-they-are-being-framed-in-prisoners-death-case/articleshow/81537078.cms||Prashant Jha

The move came as Dilawar approached Independent MLA Sanyam Lodha, who was speaking on demands for grants for education, art and culture, after interrupting him.When Lodha objected to Dilawar’s behaviour, Speaker CP Joshi warned the BJP MLA. When Dilawar did not pay any heed to him, Joshi asked parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal to bring a motion to suspend the legislator.Dhariwal then moved a motion to suspend Dilawar from the House for seven days, which was passed by voice vote and marshals approached the well to remove the suspended member.Soon after, BJP MLAs protesting in the well of the House formed a human chain around Dilawar to stop him from being escorted out by marshals and a scuffle erupted.Seeing the situation spiraling out of control, the Speaker adjourned the House for 30 minutes. It all started when deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore and BJP MLA Kalicharan Saraf moved an adjournment motion on the phone-tapping issue during Zero Hour. Trouble started when speaker Joshi rejected the motion on the ground of bereft of facts and details.The Speaker said he would allow a discussion only if the opposition furnished details of the incident. “I will not review my decision on adjournment. It will set a wrong precedent,” said the speaker. Thus, the stalemate between the opposition and the Speaker continued as both sides stuck to their guns. The BJP protest ended after the House was adjourned for the day. Opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria said, “We are under compulsion as the issue is very important and this government could fall on the issue.” The BJP had on Monday called for the resignation of Gehlot on moral grounds and demanded a CBI inquiry into the phone-tapping issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mla-dilawar-suspended-for-misbehaviour/articleshow/81538342.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu elections 2021: Chennai at the core of DMK’s poll battle||CHENNAI: Determined to retain its bastion, the DMK has fielded candidates in 15 of Chennai’s 16 constituencies, leaving only Velachery seat to ally Congress. Rival AIADMK has nominated candidates for 10 seats, leaving the remaining six to the PMK, the BJP, the TMC and two other smaller allies. Historically, Chennaiites had plumped for the DMK even when the rest of the state voted for AIADMK. This was the case at least five times since M G Ramachandran’s AIADMK took the electoral plunge in 1977. The DMK’s deep-rooted connect with Chennai can be traced back to 1959 when a young Karunanidhi and friends captured the Madras Corporation council by defeating the Congress. This was a decade after C N Annadurai had launched the DMK from Robinson Park in Royapuram, Chennai. K Anbazhagan was the first to win from Chennai (Egmore) when the DMK made its electoral debut in 1957. The constituencies in the core city increased to 16 from 14 constituencies in the 2011 election following the delimitation exercise. The DMK retained its hold over Chennai by strengthening its support base among the poor in urban pockets.  “Traditionally, urban centres are anti-establishment. The DMK capitalised on this sentiment in 1967 and retained its hold over Chennai city through pioneering schemes of the Housing Board and Slum Clearance Board. Chennai was one city that evaded M G Ramachandran and his AIADMK,” said political analyst N Sathiya Moorthy.  He recalled how MGR was apprehensive and did not hold a corporation election during his ten-year stint at Fort St George. DMK’s M K Stalin became the first elected mayor of Chennai after the 1996 election. The AIADMK won the lone R K Nagar seat in 1977 and two to three seats in the subsequent elections. But MGR’s successor, J Jayalalithaa made inroads, riding on factors such as the Rajiv Gandhi assassination, new Veeranam scheme for water-starved Chennai and a turbulent phase of power shortage, in the subsequent elections. “The opposition propaganda on the Jayalalithaa government’s handling of the Chennai floods, choice of candidates and lack of alliance strategy were the reasons for AIADMK’s (poor) performance in 2016,” said former mayor and AIADMK’s Saidapet candidate, Saidai S Duraisamy said. He was one of the three AIADMK candidates who won in the 1984 election. Jayalalithaa considered R K Nagar in north Chennai a safe bet. On her release from prison she, contested and won a bypoll from the seat in 2015 and again prevailed in 2016.  DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi and Anbazhagan represented Chennai constituencies nine and eight times respectively. If the middle and lower-income group stood by the DMK in Chennai, the urban literates too leaned towards the Dravidian major for its commitment to principles of social justice, said Dravidian historian K Thirunavukkarasu. The DMK has now re-nominated six of the 10 sitting MLAs for the April 6 election, hoping to make a clean sweep after winning all three Parliamentary seats in the 2019 general election. The DMK has won the Harbour and Chepauk assembly segments in nine of ten elections.  This time Udhayanidhi Stalin is the DMK candidate in Chepauk, pitted against a PMK nominee. The AIADMK has won the Mylapore and R K Nagar seats five times each. In 2016, it won six seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-at-the-core-of-dmks-poll-battle/articleshow/81538340.cms||Julie Mariappan

Although China has made similar announcements in 19 other countries, India is not among the nations where any Chinese vaccine is available. There is also no proposal to make any Chinese vaccine available to Indian nationals in the near future. The decision effectively makes it mandatory for those looking to return to China for employment and other activities to be inoculated with a Chinese vaccine. "Persons and their family members (who have Chinese vaccination certificates) going to China to carry on their employment contracts, work resumption and other relevant activities are allowed to submit their visa applications through Chinese visa application service centre to Chinese embassy or consulates in India following the same way as before the epidemic occurred," the embassy said in a notice. The announcement will be of little use for many Indian students who are stuck in India awaiting Beijing to permit their return as there are no Chinese vaccines available in India. Chinese authorities in Beijing justified the "unilateral" decision saying they were trying to “facilitate international travel". The Chinese embassy didn't clarify how Indians can access Chinese-made vaccines in India. Global Times reported that such notices were put up by Chinese embassies in 20 countries. Asked about the rationale behind the announcement, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing on Tuesday that many countries had floated the idea of linking vaccination status with opening up international travel. “Our proposal to facilitate the travel of those who have been inoculated with Chinese vaccines is made after thoroughly considering the safety and efficacy of Chinese vaccines," he said. "We believe this is a meaningful exploration of facilitating international travel once mass vaccination has been achieved. It is not linked to the recognition of Chinese vaccines. This is an arrangement made by the Chinese side unilaterally. It is a different thing from vaccine recognition," he added. Over 23,000 Indian students, most of them medical students, besides hundreds of professionals working in China are stuck in India since last year due to coronavirus travel restrictions. Despite repeated representations from the Indian embassy and appeals by the students, China is yet to respond positively, an agency report from Beijing said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-opens-then-shuts-door-for-indians-looking-to-return/articleshow/81541120.cms||---

According to police sources, a team from Baniyather police station was conducting a vehicle checking drive near Chandausi road on the city outskirts when a vehicle with a Delhi registration number was intercepted on suspicion. As soon as police stopped the car, the occupants opened fire at the police teams in a bid to escape, injuring a policeman, they said. Superintendent of police (city) Chakresh Mishra said, “One of our constables sustained a bullet injury in his leg. In the retaliatory firing, an accused also got injured. As two other accused tried to flee the spot, the police team caught them after a brief chase and seized smack worth Rs 1.25 crore from the car, illegal arms and mobile phones.” Both the injured policeman and the accused were admitted to a community health centre in Sambhal. “A thorough investigation has been ordered. During interrogation, the accused said the smack was being transported from Badaun to Delhi. Further interrogation is underway. We are looking into contact details and other information saved in their mobile phones to get information about their network,” added the SP. Baniyather police station SHO Vikas Saxena said the accused — identified as Arvind, Vinod and Ajay Kumar, all residents of Delhi — were arrested with 1.232 kg smack, two illegal .315 bore weapons, cartridges and four mobile phones and a four-wheeler. They were booked under appropriate sections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/three-drug-peddlers-arrested-with-smack-worth-rs-1-25-crore/articleshow/81537083.cms||Maria Khan

There is also one proposal to increase the number of hostels within the campus in keeping with the increasing number of courses offered by the university. Senate member Shamkant Deshmukh has suggested SPPU should start a bachelor’s degree in data science from the new academic year and a master’s course in the same faculty in the near future. Deshmukh said, “SPPU’s BSc in Animation course is highly popular among students due to a large number of job opportunities in the fields of animation, graphic design, gaming, advertising, video production, visual effects. However, when it comes to the master’s degree in the same field, their options are limited. Considering the scenario, a master’s course should be started by the university.” Many other proposals will also be discussed in the senate meeting which involves schemes and scholarships offered by SPPU, examination, payment of teachers in unaided colleges, transparency in choosing PhD guides among others. Rajeev Sabde, another senate member, sought a revision of buildings allotted to departments, depending upon the strength of students and staff working in the department.

Similar is the case districts like Jodhpur, Udaipur, Bikaner, he said. This clearly shows that there is a steady decline in the death toll due to efficient management. Except in Jaipur and Jhalawar, the number of infant deaths has increased. The number of deaths in Jaipur is attributed to the high number of referral cases, he said. The minister said in the Budget 2021-22, it has been announced to provide a total of 58 ventilators, multi-monitor systems and ambulances with AC in 36 medical departments. Through them, sick children will be immediately shifted to major hospitals and treated. This will also reduce the percentage of IMR.He informed that the health ministry of the central government has also praised the work done by the state government for the health of children. He said that according to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) report of the central government, Rajasthan was not among the top-10 states in the statistics of child deaths. When the state government also released the data of this report, from the year 2020, the Centre stopped releasing the report, he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/none-found-guilty-for-kota-infant-deaths-min/articleshow/81538358.cms||---

---||Chennai||Hospitals give vaccine shots on the sly||CHENNAI: Several city hospitals are discreetly offering Covid vaccines to healthy individuals less than 45 years of age without making entries in the Co-Win portal or by tagging them as ‘frontline’/ ‘healthcare’ workers. While the state public health department says vaccines approved for emergency-use can’t be given to those outside the specified groups, infectious diseases experts are asking the government to open it for all adults. Four days ago, a 44-year-old healthy Besant Nagar resident took the Covid vaccine along with her husband, a 47-year-old diabetic. “I was not willing to wait. If my husband is vaccinated, he can still bring home the infection. So, when the hospital offered to categorise me a frontline worker, I paid `250 and took the shot,” she said displaying the vaccine certificate downloaded from the portal. Some private hospitals say they offer doses that would have otherwise been wasted on people who wanted them without making entries on the portal. Nurses at UPHCs say they get barely three minutes with a patient. While one collects details including name, Aadhaar/PAN and phone number, the other injects the vaccine. “If patients are above 60 we don’t ask them anything. We ask them to take paracetamol after the injection. If those below 60 say they have comorbid conditions, we give it to them. We don’t have to upload certificates or prescriptions on the portal,” said one nurse. Directorate of public health officials say Covishield, the Oxford vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute, and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin have been approved for emergency use. “Permission has been granted to vaccine centres to offer them first to healthcare providers, later to frontline workers, people above 60 years and vulnerable people in the 45-59 age group. Offering it to anyone outside this group will be a violation,” said joint director (immunisation) Dr K Vinay Kumar. Experts differ. The goal now should be on preventing severe disease and death, safe reopening of educational institutions, and making essential services safe, said senior epidemiologist Dr Jayaprakash Muliyul. “India introduced the vaccines before it had adequate results. In retrospect, I think we have done reasonably well. Both vaccines are good. If available, vaccines should be given to everyone above 45. If there are more, they should be accessible to all adults,” he said. One reason for the spike in cases is that people who were careful for nearly a year have become impatient. “While we should encourage them to trust the mask, they should be offered the vaccine too,” he added.

---||Delhi||Earth-shaking moves: Delhi Metro to track vibration levels at 80 locations||NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is going to monitor vibration levels caused by train movement at 80 locations along Yellow (Samaypur Badli-Huda City Centre) and Violet (Kashmere Gate-Ballabhgarh) lines. The locations are expected to be mainly in central and south Delhi, apart from Gurgaon and Faridabad. DMRC has floated a tender to engage an agency to carry out the task, including 24-hour monitoring at 60 locations and eight-hour monitoring at 20 places. The agency would collect samples from these 80 locations and the exercise has to be completed within a year. A DMRC spokesperson said that similar exercises were being carried out for a decade now. The tender has been floated as part of routine monitoring work being carried out since 2011. “This practice is primarily adopted to eliminate vibration-related problems at locations where residential buildings are too close or places where it is anticipated that it may lead to problems,” he added. “In the past, monitoring was carried out at Saket, Malaviya Nagar, Begumpur, Hauz Khas, Khan Market, Golf Links, Azadpur, Dashrathpuri, etc. The objective is to randomly collect samples from different locations to assess whether the vibration levels are within acceptable limits. If any variation is reported, then necessary steps are taken to mitigate them,” said the spokesperson, adding that the actual number of locations could vary based on conditions on the ground and technical requirements. The teams that would carry out the monitoring would be headed by a technical analyst with at least three years’ experience in analysing such data and preparation of the report, apart from site supervisors with experience in carrying out the task and knowledge of operating equipment, including transfer of data, etc. The experts would use “tri-axial velocity sensors” for the exercise, apart from transit vibration monitoring instruments with analysing software. At each location, vibrations would be measured at a sampling rate of minimum 1,024 samples per second in a frequency range of 1 to 300Hz. Recording time for each sample would be a minimum of 30 seconds. The monitoring equipment would have a minimum memory capacity of 1GB to store at least 2,000 events of 30 seconds each. The spokesperson said other reasons for carrying out such an exercise included routine track-level vibration monitoring, which is done twice — before taking up maintenance activities of tracks and rolling stock and on completion of those activities. “This type of monitoring helps in ensuring that track and rolling stock systems are performing within the defined parameters,” he added. “The monitoring is conducted based on noise and vibration guidelines of Research Designs and Standards Organisation and Federal Transit Administration. Since the start, DMRC has taken adequate care to ensure that vibration levels in its underground sections remain within permissible limits,” said the official. The official added, “The practice prevalent currently includes providing two layers of thick padding on the tracks to reduce vibration in Phase-I and II projects. Strengthening was done with one more layer in Phase-III with the use of mass spring system technology in which a thick polyurethane pad sheet was spread underneath the tracks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/earth-shaking-moves-delhi-metro-to-track-vibration-levels-at-80-locations/articleshow/81538388.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The one-time password that applicants receive during registration is not reaching applicants hampering the process. The last date of application is March 21 and the education department officials said they will resolve the issue in the next two days and if needed the dates will be extended. In-charge of RTE, Dinkar Temkar, said, "The OTP issue is being resolved at the moment and we have told the applicants to hold the form-filling exercise till the problem is solved. We have told our technical team to resolve the issue on a war front so that the beneficiaries are not inconvenienced." The beneficiaries have to log in to the RTE portal and create a new id and get an OTP on the registered mobile number. Parents have complained that despite waiting for 30 minutes or more they have not been receiving the OTP. Vikas Kale, a parent of one of the beneficiaries who has been trying to fill up the form since Sunday, said, "We have had a bad experience filling the form. I have tried at least 7-8 times in two days. After that there was a message on the portal which restricted us to fill forms till the problem is resolved." Sumati Sankpal, another parent, said, "My brother has been trying to file the application for my daughter but he has been unsuccessful. The last date is March 21 and we are hoping that the problem is fixed by then." The admissions are conducted for students belonging to economically poor sections of the society and reserved category students for entry to private English medium schools. This year, there will be 96,658 seats across Maharashtra under this scheme with 9,432 schools registering for the admissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rte-applicants-hindered-by-otp-process/articleshow/81538368.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Though the city has reported 541cases in 16 days of March, active cases rose to 516 on Monday. Though the city is continuously reporting sporadic infections from several areas, cases in clusters have not been reported, which is a matter of relief for the health authorities. Sporadic cases are constantly being reported from 15 to 25 places on an average daily. The areas which are continuously reporting cases are Bani Park, Walled City areas, Jhotwara, Jagatpura, Mansarovar, Malviya Nagar, Sanganer, Shastri Nagar,Sodala, Vaishali Nagar and Vidhyadhar Nagar. Health department officials said the cases are sporadic and there are no such hotspots or clusters. The cases are being reported in single digits. Since the daily new infections are on the rise marginally, the active cases, which were 335 on March 1, has now risen to 516 as on March 16. “Efforts are underway to contain the spread of the virus. We are conducting contact tracing for early identification of cases. Also our teams are deployed at airports, railway stations and bus stands for screening and testing of suspected cases,” said a senior health department official. In March, 55,553 Covid tests have been conducted by the health department and out of those, 541 were tested positive. The positivity rate is even less than 1%, which means out of 100 tests done in the city, one person was tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/25-of-covid-cases-detected-in-city-this-month-reported-in-last-3-days/articleshow/81538371.cms||---

Varghese’s plan is to contest as an independent candidate and tell the people about what transpired between his company and state-owned KSINC, leading to the formal signing of an MoU. He said that the fisheries minister cheated him by unilaterally withdrawing from the project. The minister had denied Varghese’s claim that she had met him or any EMCC official when she visited the US to attend a meeting of the United Nations two years ago. She had also denied that Varghese met her in her office to expedite the project aimed at deep-sea fishing off the coast of Kerala. Varghese’s decision to contest against Mercykuttyamma at Kundara is likely to evoke some response against her. A good chunk of the electorate at Kundara eke out a living by fishing. It would help create the impression that the minister had done something detrimental to the interests of the fisherfolk and the state. The opposition UDF and BJP would try to keep the issue burning during the poll campaign. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/emcc-prez-to-contest-against-fisheries-min/articleshow/81537132.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The development comes a year after the wholesale market emerged as the largest cluster of Covid-19 cases last year. Greater Chennai Corporation has lodged a police complaint to trace the two persons. According to a corporation official, 300 to 400 people are randomly tested at the wholesale market every day. Following two RT-PCR tests on Sunday, two individuals were found infected with Covid-19. However, they did not furnish their residential address and their phones were also switched off. “Verification of records revealed that the two had given Koyambedu market as their address,” a corporation official said. These were the first Covid-19 positive cases to be reported at the market in recent months, the official said, adding that no new case was detected on Monday. The official said the corporation will now ask every person being tested at Koyambedu market to furnish an identity card for contact tracing. Load workers who do not have identity cards has to give the shop number where they are employed. The number of individuals subjected to random tests will be increased by 200 every day, the official said.

In the last few days, the health department has found infected passengers who were planning to travel to Mumbai from different parts of the state. Most of the passengers were asymptomatic when they were found infected. “There was a person from Jawahar Nagar who was planning to go to Mumbai. Since it is mandatory for a person travelling to Mumbai to show a Covid negative report 72 hours before the journey, he underwent the test and was found positive. When we conducted contact tracing, his family’s four other members were found infected,” said a senior health department official in Jaipur. At Balotra in Jaisalmer, another person planning to travel to Mumbai was also found infected with the virus. “Since he was found infected, he was not allowed to travel,” said a health department official. Rajasthan is also not allowing passengers from Maharashtra, Kerala, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab to enter the state without a Covid negative report. A health department official said mandatory negative report is also helping passengers travelling in flights a safe journey. “If a infected person is travelling in flights, buses or trains,there are higher chances of co-passengers contracting the infection.

In our industry, we have actresses, directors and directors of photography who are trying to push the envelope. Especially in OTT platforms, you will see a majority of women working in the frontline and breaking moulds,” said actress Renuka Shahane. Along with Lucknow-born theatre and film director Atul Tiwari, Shahane was a part of a panel discussion on ‘Evolutionary Roles of Feminism in Real and Reel Life’ at the spring edition of Metaphor Lucknow Lit Fest. “In both real and reel life, women are looking out for different voices and they want a change in their creative roles. They want to share their unique experiences just like their significant others do on screen or off screen. There has been a great evolution in that sense because women of our country have definitely grown,” said Shahane. Sharing a personal anecdote, Tiwari mentioned how liberal parents gave way to women who broke stereotypes and were independent beings. “In a gathering, writer-director Shyam Benegal in a conversation with Col BN Zaidi, father of screenplay writer Shama Zaidi said that Zaidi’s daughter must have been born and brought up in Rampur but she doesn’t know how to cook Rampur Biryani. To which Zaidi replied that women’s identities are not defined by what they cook. He was a liberal parent and evolved man. It was a result of that that Shama became a famous screenplay writer,” said Tiwari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/women-want-change-in-their-creative-roles-too-shahane/articleshow/81539536.cms||Aditi Singh

CEO of Devasthanam board Ravinath Raman told TOI that the application, which would be released in April, will provide all the facilities like registration, hotel and cab bookings, and other related details. “The aim of creating this application is to give devotees a user-friendly platform where they can get all the assistance related to Char Dham Yatra, as we are making registration mandatory this year, too. The registration criteria would help us in getting to know the headcount of devotees who will turn up in the yatra and locate them in case of any untoward incidence takes place,” said Raman. He added that the board is also trying to include helicopter bookings for Char Dham temples, but the final nod from the civil aviation department is pending. The board official also maintained that only registration is mandatory this year and there is no cap on the number of per day visitors as of now. It has already been announced that the portals of Badrinath shrine would open on May 18, Kedarnath temple portal would open on May 17, while the portals of Gangotri and Yamunotri would be opened on the auspicious occasion of Akshay Tritiya which falls on May 14.

---||Ahmedabad||Longer curfew leaves restaurateurs, traders miffed||The state government has once again imposed night curfew in four major cities of Gujarat till March 31, and this has not gone down well with restaurateurs and traders. Businessmen raised their voices against government’s decision to extend curfew by two hours and implementing it at 10pm instead of midnight, claiming that their revenue will take a hit. Citizens as well as entrepreneurs said they are bearing the brunt of the government’s lack of uniformity in enforcing Covid safety rules in the city as well as the state. Narendra Somani, president of Hotels and Restaurants’ Association – Gujarat, said, “The government’s decision to impose curfew has affected the restaurant industry since the beginning. When the curfew was scheduled from midnight to 6am, the industry began to revive. We were hoping to recover lost revenues when curfew timings have once again been imposed from 10pm to 6am. With this, the industry will once again suffer in terms of revenues.” The new norms will force restaurants and eateries to once again shut shop by 9pm as their staff will need an hour to wind up and reach home. Even traders are irked by the enforcement of curfew from 10pm onwards because it will cut into their time for business. “Several stores were staying open till 10-10.30pm to procure whatever business possible. However, the curfew will once again compel shops to shut early on,” said Jayendra Tanna, president, Gujarat Traders’ Federation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/longer-curfew-leaves-restaurateurs-traders-miffed/articleshow/81538391.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bandra, Chembur daily count beats September-October figures||MUMBAI: These days Chembur and Bandra municipal wards add more Covid-19 cases every day than during the peak of the pandemic in September-October, show BMC statistics. Doctors in these areas, though, said there was no corresponding rise in deaths so far. “We have 60 patients with mild Covid-19 symptoms and nine who are serious and on ventilator support,” Dr Prince Surana, who owns the Surana Sethia Hospital in Chembur, said. His hospital occupancy had dropped to 20 patients in early February but has ballooned again. Another doctor in the suburb said his hospital was on the verge of increasing non-Covid work as the cases had dropped between October and February. “But we have now been told by the BMC to revive our Covid facility to full bed strength,” he said. Health officials from M-West and H-West municipal wards blamed the surge on people’s failure to adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour. They said the fear that Covid evoked a year ago has disappeared, resulting in people not even wearing a face mask. In September, the M-West ward, which comprises parts of Chembur and Tilak Nagar, used to report up to 85 cases a day. In the past month, the daily count has climbed to 94 cases on some days. M-West ward health officer Dr Bhupendra Patil said: “Non-essential gatherings like birthday parties and family get-togethers are taking place freely. These gatherings had halted for several months last year. We are sending our teams regularly to check and crackdown on venues flouting the Covid norms.” In H-West ward, which includes areas of Bandra, Khar and Santacruz, officials said that while case numbers were rising, mortality had been almost zero. “The ward has reported 750 cases since the beginning of the month, but there are zero deaths,” ward medical officer Dr Sanjay Funde said. In H-West, it has been 65-70 cases daily these days compared to 45-50 in the August-September period. M-West ward currently has a Covid-19 case growth rate of 0.57%, while H-West ward has a growth rate of 0.53%, much higher than the city’s overall average growth rate of 0.42%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaibandra-chembur-daily-count-beats-sept-oct-figures/articleshow/81538411.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Chennai||Extension of postal ballots: HC reserves orders on DMK petition||Chennai: The Madras high court has reserved its order on DMK pleas challenging the validity of Election Commission of India (ECI) notifications extending the postal ballot voting option to senior citizens aged above 80, persons with disabilities and persons infected or suspected to be infected by Covid-19 in the upcoming assembly election. On Tuesday, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy also directed the ECI to ensure that the list of such absentee voters (persons opting for postal ballot) is shared with recognised political parties by March 29. This apart, the bench orally asked the ECI to ensure the safety and security of women staff engaged in election work by providing them proper transport and toilet facilities. According to DMK, Section 60 (c) of the Representation of the People Act is against the basic feature of the constitution, as it violates the secrecy in voting guaranteed in direct elections, though it is a sine qua non for ensuring free and fair elections and maintaining purity in elections. “Secrecy in voting is guaranteed in the Act forms a fundamental foundation for free and fair elections and for establishment of parliamentary democracy,” senior advocate P Wilson said, representing the petitioner. Section 60 (c) gives the executive to name anyone to be entitled for postal ballot who can skip from visiting the polling booth and political parties audit. Therefore, such unbridled power is antithesis and arbitrary to law and is liable to be quashed, he said. “The violence the impugned Section is causing is borne by the fact that the election commission has brought a new and surprising class of voters called absentee voters who are not of class themselves. The new rules have brought four categories of absentee voters - persons employed in essential services, persons above 65 years, persons with disability and persons affected or suspect of Covid-19,” the petitioner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/extension-of-postal-ballots-hc-reserves-orders-on-dmk-petition/articleshow/81538396.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

DCP, traffic, Khyati Garg, who has launched the initiative called ‘Saathi’ project, said as many as 200 students would be roped in to manage traffic across the city. “They will be provided training after which they will manage traffic for two days every week,” she said, adding that they would also be given ID cards like special police officers (SPO) so that they feel special and work with a sense of responsibility. “The objective of the project is to regulate traffic in the city. Every three months, as many as 10,000 vehicles are being added which put immense pressure on the roads. Students will also get to know about roads signs and safety measures so that they are able to sensitise others who come in contact with them,” Garg added. She said a proper curriculum has been designed by the traffic police on the basis of which these volunteers would be trained. “They will be given drills about handling basic traffic movement, making a green corridor, tackling of VVIP escorts, assembly/general elections, bandhs, festivals and cricket matches,” the DCP said. She said initially the students would manage traffic on Saturdays and Sundays, and later join traffic cops on week days as per their availability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/students-to-help-cops-ease-citys-traffic-woes/articleshow/81539574.cms||---
---||Kolkata||75-year-old book shop, once Ray’s favourite haunt, downs shutters||KOLKATA: Never did Mohan Tiwari, 92, imagine it would be curtains for his heritage bookshop on Ray’s 100th birth anniversary year. Mohan’s Books & Magazines, opposite Lighthouse Cinema, used to be a favourite haunt of the Oscar award winner and several other Kolkata luminaries. Ray would spend hours in this cozy space, which has turned out to be a casualty of the pandemic on its 75th year. Tuesday was the last day for the bookshop, which is now being rejuvenated in its new avatar as a garment outlet. The books are being sold with huge discounts. “Interior decorators will start working from Thursday. We need to empty the place,” 50-year-old Gopal Tiwari, Mohan Tiwari’s son, told TOI. “Ray habitually frequented our shop, idled around for the sheer joy of browsing through books, sometimes reading a non-fiction or simply flipping through our huge stock of latest magazines.” Anirban Mitra, who has made the award-winning docu-feature on Ray’s bio-photographer Nemai Ghosh, said, “Nemai Ghosh told me that once Ray was at Mohan’s soon after the publication of ‘Our Films, Their Films’. The news spread that Ray was at the shop, signing his new book. Soon, hundreds of copies were sold.” Mitra himself would visit almost every weekend and returned once the lockdown was relaxed, not only to procure a specific title “but for the whole fun of sitting in this quaint bookshop, discovering stuff one never knew existed.” Along with popular publications, there was a growing stock of unsold and dated books which would be relegated to the top racks. Familiar customers looked up these shelves, for those rare series. In the Eighties and the Nineties, the shop in the prime zone of downtown Kolkata easily became a college-goers’ hangout zone. “I remember seeing Aparna Sen in our shop. There were others — professors, filmmakers, advertisement personalities, who dropped by whenever they came this side,” sighed a nostalgic Gopal. “We have been incurring losses for the last five or six years, ever since buying books online became a trend. There are also e-books these days. Whatever may be the reason behind the closing, I find this not just yet another loss of good old charm of things but an unfortunate erosion of the soul of our city and society,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/75-year-old-book-shop-once-rays-favourite-haunt-downs-shutters/articleshow/81537137.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||Kolkata||Inoculation drive on fast lane as West Bengal crosses 2.5 lakh-a-day target||KOLKATA: In a major boost to the Covid vaccination programme, more than 2.5 lakh doses were administered on Monday across the state. With 2,70,532 people taking the jab at 2,903 sites, it was the highest single-day turnout in Bengal so far. With the initial hiccups in Co-Win 2.0 easing up gradually, the state health department officials are hopeful of achieving stiffer targets in the coming weeks. The state had achieved the first milestone of administering 1 lakh doses a day on February 24, when 1,00,174 recipients took the shot. The number started swelling up after the phase III rollout began on March 1, when people over 60 and those above 45 years and with co-morbidities were included in the inoculation programme. “On Monday, when we recorded over 2.5 lakh doses, a little over 1.5 lakh elderly citizens and 44,537 in the 45-plus category took the jab,” said Ajay Chakraborty, state director for health services. TimesViewThe numbers are impressive. The focus should now be on getting on board as many different sections as possible so that the drive becomes truly inclusive.In contrast to the vaccine hesitancy even among healthcare workers when the first phase rollout began on January 16, senior citizens had been thronging Covid-19 vaccination centres (CVCs) from Day 1. Though the number of people above 45 with co-morbidities turning up for the vaccine was not encouraging in the first couple of days, their number is picking up significantly. The overwhelming response even led to some hospitals starting 24X7 vaccination facility centres. “With the pandemic threatening to come back, it is good to see the response from the elderly population and those with co-morbidities to get themselves inoculated. Many of them are being motivated by their doctors. While the response has been impressive from the informed section of the population, we also need to see that people from the less-informed section are also motivated to take the vaccine,” said Santanu Tripathi, a senior clinical trial expert and former head of clinical and experimental pharmacology at School of Tropical Medicine. Bolstered by the surging turnout, the health department will be scaling up the number of vaccination sites. The department has already extended the vaccination hours while some centres have been allowed to operate round the clock. “During the first phases, we had a little over 1,000 sites. Now we have more than double of that. In fact, we have the capacity to jack up the number to 5,000 and the manpower to administer doses to 5 lakh people a day. But due to the technical hitches in the software, we could not scale up the site numbers immediately. Now that the system is functioning better, we will be in a position to improve our record,” said a health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/inoculation-drive-on-fast-lane-as-bengal-crosses-2-5l-a-day-target/articleshow/81537151.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

ED has been probing Narender Kumar Patel, Madhu Maruswamy and Jigishben Patel, directors of Inrhythm Energy, under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The ED said the attached assets are located in and around Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam owned by accused Narender Kumar, his family members and associates. The ED issued ECIR based on three FIRs filed by the CBI and one FIR filed by Hyderabad central crime station against Narender Kumar, Madhu and others for defrauding several banks to the tune of Rs 155.4 crore. The ED has also filed a prosecution complaint on March 16 before the PMLA special court against Narender Kumar and seven other accused. The ED said after that CBI issued the FIRs, Narender Kumar, his wife Jigishben Patel and Madhu had fled from India and settled in the US. They could not be arrested by the CBI, which filed chargesheets in their FIRs by showing the accused as absconding. In January this year, with the help of immigration authorities, the ED managed to intercept Narender Kumar on January 16 when he landed at Ahmedabad International Airport. He was arrested under the PMLA. He was subsequently remanded to ED custody and is presently in judicial custody. The remaining two accused are still in the US. Investigation under the PMLA has revealed the modus operandi of Narender Kumar and Madhu, who fraudulently obtained loans of Rs 65 crore from SBI, Rs 37 crore from erstwhile State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, Rs 25 crore from Exim Bank, Rs 12 crore from DCB Bank, Rs 10 crore from erstwhile Dena Bank and Rs 9 crore from Bank of Maharashtra totalling to Rs 157 crore. The duo submitted fabricated, forged property documents and properties with legal disputes. The ED said: “All these loans were siphoned off by Narender Kumar and Madhu using a complex web of transactions through its sister concerns and third party entities by making accommodation entries. Part of the proceeds of crime are in possession of the fugitive accused in America.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ed-attaches-rs-31-cr-assets-of-city-firm-in-loan-fraud-case-2-accused-in-us/articleshow/81538409.cms||---

The commission said that the misconduct of few officers shakes public’s trust in the police. “The National Commission for Women has come across a media report regarding a rape victim who has alleged that the investigating officer first demanded a bribe, later started harassing her and demanding sexual favours. Further, the ACB has arrested the officer.The commission is perturbed by the reported incident and the loss of confidence of common man in police system due to the mistake of a few officials,” said the letter. The ACB has claimed to have incriminating evidence against suspended RPS officer Kailash Bohra of forcing the rape survivor for sexual favours over the phone and during conversations. The conversations show that Bohra had been consistently demanding sexual favours on the pretext of getting the main accused arrested. The commission in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 10 of National Commission for Women Act, 1990 has taken cognizance in the matter and seeks immediate action on the concerned Officer to avoid recurrence of such incident in the future. “The detailed action taken report in the matter be sent to the Commission at an early date”, the letter to DGP M L Lather said. This is the second time in less than ten days time that NCW has taken cognizance of a crime against women in Rajasthan. On March 9, the commission had taken cognisance of the case in which a married woman was allegedly trapped and raped repeatedly inside the compound of a police station in Alwar. NCW had written to Rajasthan DGP seeking adherence to guidelines of MHA of completing probes in two months in cases of sexual assault.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ncw-seeks-report-on-cop-who-sought-sexual-favours-from-rape-survivor/articleshow/81538405.cms||---

Since then, the hospital has come a long way, turning into a formidable name when it comes to handling Covid patients. “Prior to this case, we have had around 20 people who had returned from abroad being brought to our facility. But we had a strong suspicion that this teenager could be positive. The result came to us around 9pm on March 17 last year and NICED reconfirmed the result. And we prepared for the job,” said pulmonologist Kausik Chaudhuri. Chaudhuri and chest specialist Sekhar Ranjan Paul started to take care of patients at the hospital. Soon, the duo was joined by infectious diseases specialist Yogiraj Ray and paediatrician Raj Shekhar Maity. “Back then, most was scared to getting close to a Covid patient. It was tough to be in the PPE initially. But we got used to it later. Motivated by Yogida, later many young doctors voluntarily came forward,” said Paul. Ray had come back to the city after completing DM in infectious diseases from AIIMS Delhi. Even as his initial posting was at the School of Tropical Medicine (STM), Ray volunteered to work in the Covid ward. “None of wants an epidemic but if and when it happens, an ID specialist would love to jump into it,” said Ray. From being a paediatrician at Sagore Dutta hospital to collecting swabs and treating Covid patients, Maity has been a part of the team through thick and thin. “While not tending to patients in hospital, I would be reading about the virus. It has been a great learning experience,” said Maity. The team started working with minimum diagnostic equipment and other gadgets. Now, the nodal hospital for Covid-19 has travelled a long way with enhanced equipment and facilities like oxygen tanks installed. “The captain and vice-captain cannot do much minus a strong time. While our principal Anima Haldar had been ensuring a smooth running the core Covid team, nurses and supporting staffers worked hard to ensure best care,” said ID&BG medical superintendent and vice-principal Asis Manna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-year-on-id-hospital-transforms-for-better-care/articleshow/81537140.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

According to police, the accused girl Jonu is pursing Bachelor’s degree in Science was alone with her mother identified as Kavita (39). “On Monday, when the father of the girl had gone to Hisaar (Haryana), the girl brought a hammer from the kitchen and hit on the head of her mother.

After attack, the woman became unconscious and was lying in a pool of blood. “Some hours after the incident, the girl intimated the police control room and stated that she has killed her mother. Initially, she was taken in custody for questioning and after completing all the paper formalities, visiting the crime scene, she was arrested on Tuesday morning,” the SP added. The incident took place when Maniram Jangid, the father of the girl along with her mother had gone to Hisaar (Haryana) for a doctor’s visit. “My daughter has been a very introvert girl. I cannot believe that she can do this,” said Maniram.

The growth in primary sector is 16.2% in Tripura against Kerala’s 6.19%. In MSME sector it is 14.2% in Tripura and 9.7% in Kerala,” he told reporters here. Kumar said the BJP government in Tripura was able to achieve a significant growth rate in all sectors, with the support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. When CPM was in power, the growth rate in major sectors were even poorer than Kerala, he said. “The CPM rule in Tripura had denied the state development in all segments. They build narratives based on blatant lies. Tripura has started enjoying the benefits of development after the BJP government came into power. Left leaders in the opposition have even raised objections when our government decided to adopt NCERT syllabus in schools. One of their objection was that book sellers would suffer a huge loss if the state adopts NCERT syllabus,” he said. Deb said he wouldn’t claim that Left politics has come to an end in Tripura. However, they are being relegated to obscurity as the state face elections one after another. “I wouldn’t say that Left politics has ended in Tripura. They still have MLAs in state assembly. But people have realised the duplicity of the Left. Earlier, the fulltime party cadres used to threaten people by claiming that they have a mechanism to know who votes for whom. If people in Tripura can understand the duplicity of comrades there, I believe people in Kerala too can,” he said. According to Deb, it was pointless to consider LDF and UDF as two political forces since Left parties and Congress are in alliance with each other in West Bengal. “They have been practicing tactics as per which LDF and UDF loots Kerala by turn,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/kerala-behind-tripura-in-growth-of-key-indices/articleshow/81537155.cms||---

---||Lucknow||BJP creates new ward-level posts to firm up base||Lucknow: The state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has created a new post at the ward level to strengthen its organizational structure in cities. Now, every ward will have a ‘mantri’ (secretary) who will work under ward ‘adhyaksh’ (president). No such post has been created in rural areas as of now. Out of 110 wards of Lucknow city, 93 got new secretaries. General secretary, Lucknow, Pushkar Shukla said the remaining posts would be filled up soon. According to party insiders, the move will enrich party’s organization through division of responsibilities and will help committed workers get official posts. By elevating workers who have proved themselves at lower administrative units for years, the party will win their confidence. A ward is an administrative unit of the party while booth is the smallest with about 7-12 of them making a sector (administrative unit which has lately been named Shakti Kendra). As UP elections are due next year, strengthening party organization is the priority of the BJP which needs more committed workers to inform people about the work done by the government in the last four years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-creates-new-ward-level-posts-to-firm-up-base/articleshow/81539605.cms||Neha Shukla

---||Bhopal||Big woof: In a first, desi breed of dogs inducted at MP Police Training School||BHOPAL: For the first time in the history of MP Police, indigenous breed of dogs are being included to be trained along with foreign breeds at Police Training School (Dog) under 23rd Battalion of special armed forces (SAF). The initiative was taken at the behest of PM Narendra Modi, who had mentioned the local Indian dog breeds during a ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio address last year. The indigenous breed of dogs were being already used by Army and paramilitary forces for various operations, but MP police is reportedly the first among the state police to include them. Ten pairs of Indian breed pups including Mudhol Hound, Rampur Greyhound, Rajapalayam, Kanni, Kombai and Chippiparai dogs were inducted into the PTS on Tuesday and will be trained for nine months. Speaking about the induction of indigenous breeds of dogs in training, Commandant Mohammed Yusuf Qureshi said that PM Modi had praised the local breeds for their utility and urged to support them citing their efficiency. MP police selected half a dozen best Indian breed of dogs from Tamil Nadu, Haryana and other states for training. He said these dogs acclimatised to Indian conditions better than the foreign breeds of dogs which need much more care and are sensitive to hot weather conditions. These breeds being indigenous are highly resistant and fall ill rarely. Their sense of smell, endurance and agility is very high and may even prove to be better than the foreign breeds. Their maintenance cost will also be less than the foreign breeds, he said. They were already being used by Army and paramilitary on the basis of their utility, good qualities and they have proved their importance. These breeds can be very good tracker and narcotic dogs. Sharing information about the indigenous breeds, Commandant Qureshi said that Mudhol Hound breed is found in Mudhol area of Bagalkot in Karnataka and it is twice as fast as German Shepherd in speed and hunting. It is also known as caravan hound. Speaking about Rampur Greyhound, Commandant Qureshi said that in early 20th century Nawab Ahmed Ali Khan of Rampur crossbred Afghan Hound and English Greyhound and prepared the indigenous breed which was called Rampur Greyhound. They are known as ‘one master’ dogs. Regarding the Rajapalayam breed, he said that this breed of dogs have been named after Rajapalayam town in Tamil Nadu. They have thin skin and are white in colour. They are known for hunting wild bores and guarding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/big-woof-in-a-first-desi-breed-of-dogs-inducted-at-mp-police-training-school/articleshow/81537160.cms||Sudeept Mishra
---||Pune||Residents of Baner-Pashan Link Road rue civic mess, seek lasting solutions||Pune: Baner-Pashan Link Road (BPLR) residents are miffed with the burning of garbage in heaps, attacks by stray dogs and dark roads because of the non-functional street lights. Residents proactive in registering complaints with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said though the civic body resolved issues such as visually polluting illegal posters and the non-functioning street lights, the problems returned within a day or two. The link road has 65 societies in the Baner-Pashan area. “There might be around 12,000 people living in these societies, but the list of civic problems is too long. Garbage piles up at the segregation point right next to a residential society. Many people have been bitten by stray dogs,” said Rajendra Chutar, president of the Baner-Pashan Link Road Residents Vikas Samitee. Rahul Jain, another resident of the area, said, “The street lights between Ojas society and Jadhav heights society functioned for a few days, and the area is again back to darkness. From incidents of dog bites to chain snatching, we have had it all in the area.” Seema Agrawal has been regularly complaining about the illegal hoardings at the Balaji Chowk and also on the poles along Sus road. “The posters and banners are of all shapes and sizes, reducing visibility at the turns. When we complain, some PMC staffers come and pull down the posters and banners. However, such material returns to the area the very next day. It’s an eyesore and there should be a permanent solution.” Another resident said on the condition of anonymity that garbage burning was a major complaint. “We send photographs and video clips to the civic authorities. The offenders should face strict punishments. Besides, there should be a traffic signal at Balaji Chowk. The barricades have reduced the traffic snarls, but people still take the wrong right-turn.” A civic official, however, admitted that the traffic signal could be set up only after an intimation from police. “The traffic police department sends a proposal to the commissioner for nod. We can act only after this. But in the past year, we have not got any such proposal from the traffic department.” The official said two PMC officers and five labourers moved around in the area in a van removing illegal hoardings. “The problem is once they are back from an area after removing posters and proceed to another, such material are back in the first locality. Filing an FIR is not possible always, but we penalize the offenders.” Another civic official said, “Nearly 80-90% of the garbage is segregated at the source in our ward and the rest is done at a common point. The recyclable garbage is segregated at this point and transported to the processing unit. But the processing unit is not working at full capacity. The result is the piling up of garbage. The problem will be resolved within a week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-of-baner-pashan-link-road-rue-civic-mess-seek-lasting-solutions/articleshow/81538460.cms||Ardhra Nair

Sources in the corporation said that the AMC has so far footed Rs 500 crore for Covid management in the city in the last one year of which the state government has paid Rs 240 crore as grants to the corporation. The fund-starved AMC is now exploring options of starting Covid treatment on chargeable basis at SVP Hospital. The finances of the corporation are in bad shape and the corporation which had acquired nearly 1,750 beds in private hospitals has slowly released all the beds of its 50% share and at present all the beds available in private hospitals are on chargeable basis. “During a meeting of the officials, it was proposed that the corporation which is under severe financial crisis should not take up further treatment of the patients free at SVP. It was proposed that the civic body should now start charging money from the people who can afford to pay the treatment cost,” said a senior officer. Another officer said that the AMC has just got Rs 240 crore as grants and the remaining amount is still not released. “In case the state denies further grants, we are left with two option — to start treatment on chargeable basis in SVP or to cut down heavily on the development funds in the coming budget for the year 2021-22 which is likely to be tabled soon,” the official added. “If we get assurance of funds there would be no cut on the development funds,” said a senior officer. The officials said that at present the AMC has no plans to acquire beds in private hospitals even if the Covid-19 cases once again cross the 350 or 400 marks. The AMC officials have been told to rely heavily on Civil Hospital, Sola Hospital and SVP,” he said. When contacted municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar said that the AMC will make a representation to the state government for release of additional grants to the corporation. The AMC has so far collected Rs 6 crore as fines for no mask and no social distancing and from malls and establishments violating Covid guidelines. The data tabled in the state assembly earlier last week revealed that 59,993 patients were treated on the government-quota beds in the city and another 3,050 patients were treated on government-quota beds in private hospitals in the Ahmedabad district barring the AMC areas till December 31, 2020. The state government stated that Rs 98 crore was paid to private hospitals in the AMC limit till December 31, 2020 for treating Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fund-starved-amc-not-to-accept-new-covid-bills/articleshow/81538488.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Notices have been issued to around 25 DMs, five commissioners and 20 SPs after they did not receive calls made to their official numbers from the chief minister’s office over the weekend. “To ensure that officials are readily available to people, the CM has been issuing regular instructions to them, asking them to be in their offices at designated times and to take all calls on their official numbers. To do a reality check, calls were made to random bureaucrats and senior police officials. A large number of these did not take the call,” said an official. Sources in the CMO said that notices were issued to divisional commissioners of Prayagraj, Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Aligarh and Lucknow for failing to respond to the phone calls. Among DMs who reportedly did not receive the call were from Kannauj, Sant Kabir Nagar, Siddharthnagar, Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Badaun, Aligarh, Hapur, Amroha, Varanais, Prayagraj, Ayodhya and Bareilly. In about 16 cases, the calls were received by the secretaries of DMs and commissioners. There were also a few who called back shortly after having missed the call from the CMO. The department of appointment and personnel has issued notices to the officials asking them to explain as soon as possible, why their phones were not received by them or they did not call back. The home department has sent notices to the police officials, asking them to explain why they did not take calls. “There could be a genuine reason for some of them not having taken calls.

Notably, in both FIRs, the woman was shown to have died twice at a gap of two days. Asked about the matter, SHO Shrikant Dwivedi said they were bound to comply with the court order. The SHO said the first FIR was registered at 11.10 pm on Sunday on the complaint of the deceased’s father Heera Lal (63) of Rooppur Krapa village. The complainant stated that he had married his daughter Saraswati Devi (25) three years ago to Surendra Pal of Chandupur village under Madhotanda police station, and had given him Rs 3 lakh cash and other valuables in dowry. But, his son-in-law and his family members started torturing, beating and abusing his daughter for additional Rs 1.5 lakh in dowry, alleged Heera Lal. “They expelled my daughter along with her one-year-old son out of the house at 9 pm on September 15, 2019, saying that she would be allowed to enter the house only with the cash,” alleged Heera Lal. “Before expelling, her husband had beaten her brutally causing her severe internal injuries. She was admitted to a private hospital where she died during the treatment on December 12, 2020. She succumbed to the injuries inflicted by her husband and in-laws,” alleged the father. The SHO said her husband and parents-in-law were booked under various sections including 498 A (subjecting a woman to cruelty) and 304 B (dowry death) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Dowry Prohibition Act. A second FIR was also lodged at 11.40 pm by the husband, alleging that his wife had gone to her parent's house to celebrate Haryali Teej in 2019 with Rs 30,000 cash and jewellery. But her parents and two other relatives killed her on the night of December 14, 2020 for the jewellery and cash, and cremated her body early the next day, alleged the husband. In the second FIR, police booked the woman’s parents and two relatives under section 302 (murder) of IPC, said the SHO Police had started investigations in both complaints, added the SHO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/after-booking-parents-for-killing-daughter-for-money-cops-book-her-husband-in-laws-for-killing-her-for-dowry/articleshow/81537162.cms||Keshav Agarwal
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: School staff told to return to work-from-home regime||MUMBAI: After the Union health secretary’s censure over the “limited” efforts to track, test and isolate Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, the public health machinery here seems to have gone into an overdrive. Plans to double tests conducted daily to 2 lakh, micro-mapping of hotspots and aggressive institutional quarantining seem to be among immediate steps to be implemented. 2 lakh tests a dayThere has been a lot of criticism about Maharashtra’s testing numbers which are lower than Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. “We still do more than the government’s recommended 14 per million,’’ said a state health official, adding that Maharashtra had adopted a “targeting testing approach” instead of widespread testing.  Dr T P Lahane, who heads department of medical education which oversees testing facilities, said the state has conducted around 1 lakh tests daily. “We recently even conducted 1.2 lakh tests a day. Now, we have plans to increase this to 2 lakh a day,’’ added Dr Lahane. Trace 30 per patientA public health department official said 20 or more contacts of every positive patient are currently being traced and tested. “We will increase it to 30 if possible,’’ he said. Ironically, the `tracing and testing’ strategy was the cornerstone of the Dharavi model that has been praised by the World Health Organisation. Tighten quarantine normsCentre’s criticism that quarantine norms are being flouted has many takers. “We have been unable to underline the seriousness of the situation,’’ said a civic doctor. BMC now plans to shift errant patients from home to institutional quarantine. “We will take help from police to do this,’’ said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. State health officials have asked hospitals to step up preparations for quarantine facilities and Oxygen-supported beds. Only online teachingOne of the first notifications of Tuesday came from BMC asking teachers and non-teaching staff of schools to go back to the work-from-home arrangement until further notice. Since October 14, 2020, as a part of unlock guidelines, half of the teaching and non-teaching staff had to report to schools at a time for online teaching/tele-counselling and related works. BMC joint commissioner Ashutosh Salil said schools must not call teachers unless very urgent. BMC gets into war modeBMC commissioner IS Chahal has sent out a message to major private hospitals asking them to reassign beds for Covid patients. He said 80% beds in the general Covid ward and 100% in the ICU ward would have to be allotted through the BMC ward control war room. Every hospital will appoint a nodal officer, no walk-in patients will be admitted directly and deaths have to be reported in 24 hours. A senior BMC official said, "With a decline in numbers over the past months, large hospitals had started tapering down their Covid service. However, with a spike in numbers, this appeal has been made to restore number of beds to last year’s level and charge patients accordingly.’’ (With inputs from Vinamrata Borwankar)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaischool-staff-told-to-return-to-work-from-home-regime/articleshow/81538465.cms||Malathy Iyer

Private forecasters and bloggers said the weather may change for the good by mid-next week as there are chances of some rain in Chennai and suburbs when pre-monsoon showers may begin over many parts of the state. For the next 48 hours, the city and the suburbs are likely to experience a maximum temperature of around 35°C and a minimum of around 24°C with clear skies. On Tuesday, the city recorded 32.3°C, around 0.3°C below normal at Nungamakkam and 33.5°C, around 0.2°C above normal. This was comparatively lower than the previous two days when mercury shot by more than 2°C. On Sunday, temperatures shot up in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam stations with a maximum of 35.1°C, which has been the highest so far this month, and 35.7°C. They were 2.5°C and 2.4°C above normal. This continued Monday with 33.6°C and 35.5°C in the two stations, with 1°C and 2.2°C above normal. IMD officials said temperatures dropping and increasing by one or two degrees was climatologically normal for the month of March and the next few days would continue to be the same- dry, hot and glaringly bright mornings and warm nights. Private forecasters said a trough extending from Kerala to interior Maharashtra, which is expected to intensify, is likely to kickstart pre-monsoon showers in the southern peninsula between March 21 and 24. “On March 23 or 24, Chennai has chances of rain due to moisture incursion from the Arabian sea and Bay of Bengal,” said Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist, Skymet Weather. Blogger Pradeep John too said weather models indicate some spells towards the end of the month. “But we have to wait and watch,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/city-to-continue-to-sizzle-heat-might-ease-up-mid-week/articleshow/81538440.cms||---

While commuters caught unawares by serpentine snarls turned restive, traffic police personnel were seen running around, trying to unwind the hold-ups. “I was stuck on the flyover for nearly half an hour this morning. Even as the traffic police were trying their best to clear the traffic, it took really long for the vehicles to even start moving,” said Mohammad Fazi, a commuter. Another commuter, Nikhila Gupta said, “It took me more than 25 minutes from Khairatabad junction to Shadan college. On a regular day, it takes me less than five minutes to cross the stretch. The roads were cramped with vehicles very close to each other, especially on the Khairatabad flyover. It is a very risky situation considering the surge in Covid-19 cases.” The massive traffic jam which was first witnessed on Khairatabad flyover had a ripple effect in other parts of the city as well, including on the Nampally road towards Lakdi-ka-pul, Shadan college and VV Statue. Similarly, from Lakdi-ka-pul towards Ravindra Bharathi and Nampally side. “The traffic jam on the flyover and the roads leading towards assembly and other areas was due to the VIP movement. It was regular traffic jam that happens during office hours, but it took some time to clear the traffic because of VIP movement,” said a traffic official, under the condition of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/assembly-session-leads-to-traffic-jam/articleshow/81538438.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Also, a majority of the large containment zones are in Cidco and Panchavati divisions of the municipal corporation. As per new Covid guidelines, a building with over five active patients is to be sealed while areas with over 20 active Covid-19 patients are to be sealed. There number of active containment zones has increased from 185 to 644 in the last one month. All the active containment zones are in residential buildings.There were no large containment zones in the city since October after there was a drop in new cases. The number of active cases in the city had dropped from an average 867 per day in September to 99 per day by the first week of February.“We are taking strict measures in containment zones. We have adopted old methods of sealing the whole building and also large areas where more Covid-19 cases are being reported,” Nagargoje said. “We are increasing tracing of high risk contacts and Covid suspects in containment zones. The rapid antigen tests are to be started on a large scale in containment zones for early detection of patients and provide early treatment. This was the same method we had adopted during the initial phase of the pandemic,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/12-large-containment-zones-identified-in-nashik-city/articleshow/81537161.cms||Tushar Pawar

Speaking in the Lok Sabha, Revanth said sedition cases were booked against the farmers after their protest on January 26. “Is there a proposal to drop the cases against farmers,” he asked. He was responding to the data furnished by Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy on the number of sedition cases registered from 2014 to 2019. Revanth raised objections saying he had sought the data for the last 10 years, including 2021. “The minister has given insufficient data. Providing half information will lead the House in wrong direction,” he said.

On Tuesday, while testing continued on the lower side at 1,00,329, the state clocked 228 cases and two deaths. While recoveries touched 138, number of active cases have shot up. And till evening, there were 1,912 cases in the state. On a positive note, more than 3 lakh persons were vaccinated in UP on Monday, the second time since March 12 when more than 3 lakh people took jabs on a single day. “The last time, daily cases were above 200 was on January 31, 2021. On February 1, the daily caseload dipped to 171 and then the entire February and half of March witnessed daily cases less than 200. We had seen a gradual rise in cases over the past week or so. Low testing continues to remain a problem, but notices have been issued to all districts to ramp up testing,” said a government official. Additional chief secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad said, the infection was going up in some other states and the trend was noticed in some districts of UP. “During random testing, some people coming from other states were detected with the virus. It is crucial to adhere to protocols as was the practice a year ago,” he said. On Tuesday, nine districts accounted for two third of cases in the state. Lucknow reported highest number of cases in the state with 44. While other districts haven’t recorded a spurt, fresh cases have climbed to double digits in some. These include Ghaziabad with 15, Gautam Budh Nagar with17, Varanasi with 10, Meerut with 19, Bareilly with 12, Aligarh with 14, Muzaffarnagar with 10, and Mathura with 10. Prasad said, while UP vaccinated over 30 lakh people till now, this should be raised significantly. “Since March 3, 2020, when the first Covid case was reported in UP, 5,94,993 have recovered, but in the same period, 8,750 people succumbed to the disease,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-count-soars-past-200-on-tue-after-45-day-plunge/articleshow/81539622.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Goud urged the court to free him from conviction and two weeks of jail in a case of destroying fields in Chintaguda forest in Warangal. He also sought relief in the seizure of a tractor belonging to V Raja Babu and a few farmers despite the court ordering him not to interfere. The bench sought to know why the forest officer was not present before court though the stay imposed on his conviction had expired six months ago. When the court had taken serious view of violations, the DFO produced fake notices. A single judge, who grew suspicious, referred the matter to private labs which found the contents tampered with. The single judge then convicted the forest officer with a Rs 2,000 penalty and sent him to jail for two weeks. When advocate general BS Prasad urged court to extend the stay and assured the officer would be present, the bench extended it for three months and adjourned the case to June 15 with a directive for the DFO to be present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-warns-forest-officer-of-jail-term/articleshow/81538469.cms||---

Substantial rise in number of containment zones has emerged as a cause of concern as it indicates that new cases are coming in clusters. For effective containment of the virus by breaking the transmission chain, health experts of the central government have been insisting upon the Punjab government for declaring the areas where cases are rising as containment zone. By March 15, as many 71 micro containment zones — areas with 5 to 14 cases — and one containment zone — areas with 15 or more cases – with a collective population of 24,841 have been set up in different parts of the state. On March 1, the number of priority zones was 13 and five on February 15. The previous highest count of contained areas was recorded on October 3 when 79 areas were identified as micro containment zones in 17 districts, with a population of 29,316, and seven containment zones in which 12,306 people were under surveillance. Nawanshahr, one of the worst-hit districts in the last one month, has the lone containment zone of the state. Of total the micro containment zones, Hoshiarpur has the highest count of 26 with 11,586 people under surveillance, while 8,385 people are under the watch of the health department in six micro containment zones identified in Gurdaspur. There are nine such zones in Jalandhar, with a population of 1,912, seven in Amritsar, six in Mohali and four in Ludhiana. With Punjab projected to get 3,000 cases per day by end of March, the number of contained areas is expected to rise steeply in the coming weeks. In the priority zones, extensive testing and four-level contact tracing are done through door-to-door surveys on a daily basis. Contained zones are sealed and restrictions are imposed on the movement of people to minimising people-to-people contact. The contained area is denotified as micro containment or containment zone if no fresh case is reported in seven days. Demarcation continues if new cases surface. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar all the required measures were being taken to break the chain of transmission in areas with a heavy caseloads. “Teams of the health department are working extensively in these areas and we are confident of controlling the spread,” said Dr Bhaskar.

---||Chennai||World Bank links social issues to $1.1bn funding||Chennai: The World Bank, which will help fund the $1.1 billion Resilient Chennai project over the next five years, has come out with a study document identifying social and environmental issues in the projects involved. The bank, which among others will be financing Greater Chennai Corporation’s mega streets project, MTC’s fleet augmentation, water resources department’s flood mitigation and conservation project in Chennai and Chengalpet and augmenting the corporation’s health and solid waste management verticals, has come out with a set of recommendations based on a detailed study on the role of each implementing agency. In the mega streets project, it has pointed out, there has been inadequate consultation with critical stakeholders and that there might lack of facilities for children, women and the differently abled. It has also pointed out how the project may lead to loss of livelihood for many and that the civic body does not have a strong plan to minimize/mitigate temporary disruption of services during construction phase on the arterial roads. The report critically reviewed grievance redressal mechanism of agencies like the corporation, MTC and Metrowater and recommended that an appraisal be taken from citizens before their complaints are closed. “The corporation has a robust grievance redressal mechanism but the protocol does not include the complainant’s satisfaction as a precondition to close the complaint,” it said. The issue had flagged by several residents through the Namma Chennai app. “To strengthen service delivery, annual satisfaction surveys, social audits and regular citizen interface through social behaviour change communication is also recommended,” it suggested, especially for the solid waste management vertical. The corporation conducts Information Education and Communciation (IEC) campaigns and organises ward level meetings and citizen interface but there are no reports on outreach and impact, it said. One of the metrics the corporation can follow is to ensure that 80% of grievances are redressed within 30 days of registration, it said, recommending hiring social management specialists for better engagement. Solid waste management staff are provided sanitisers, gloves, shoes and masks, but their disciplined use is poor, placing them at risk of contracting infections, it said. MTC was asked to reach out to resolve grievances of contracted workers and hire a dedicated specialist for safety and accessibility audits of buses. MTC should train staff on citizen engagement and gender mainstreaming, it suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/world-bank-links-social-issues-to-1-1bn-funding/articleshow/81538466.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

There were 121 micro-containment zones in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits and 895 restricted zones in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits till March 15. More containment zones were located in the urban areas. On an average, around 2,500 positive cases per day were recorded in both civic limits in the last fortnight. The difference in parameters followed by the PMC and PCMC contributed to the vast difference in the number of containment zones in their respective limits. In the PMC limits, a building, which has five or more positive cases is declared as a micro-containment zone, while the PCMC declares it if there are two cases. However, any housing society with more than eight cases is marked as a major containment zone by the PCMC. In the micro-containment zones, the administration is declaring only a flat/floor/house as a containment zone, while in the major containment zone, an entire building can be declared as a containment zone. There are 145 major containment zones in Pimpri Chinchwad.  A senior PMC official saidthe core city areas such as the Peth areas didn’t have many containment zones. “The aim behind drawing containment zones is to create awareness about the Covid-19 spread and also to control it. Public participation has to be increased to control the spread of the virus. We are roping in housing societies and their office bearers to keep an eye on the positive patients to reduce violations,” Ashish Bharati, the head of PMC’s health department, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-1k-micro-containment-zones-in-pmc-pcmc-limits/articleshow/81538474.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Police said the accused laced her tea with sedative and when she was knocked out, he raped her and captured her obscene video to blackmail her. Following the order of superintendent of police Jai Prakash Yadav, an FIR was registered on Monday night. The complainant — the mother of three children — stated that she was widowed in 2018. Posing as caretaker of her family, her younger sister’s father-in-law, 55, started visiting her house frequently, she said. “One day, when I served him tea, he sneakily mixed a sedative in my cup and after taking the tea when I lost my consciousness, he raped me and filmed the act,” alleged the complainant, adding that "he threatened me with making the video public if I denied following his orders”. “Thereafter, he would often rape me and victimise me with unnatural sex. Whenever I opposed him, he would beat me and my children brutally,” she alleged. “On February 27, he tried to set me afire, but I managed to escape from his clutches and lodged a written complaint to Sungarhi police station, but the accused was sent to jail only for the breach of peace. Then I narrated my ordeal to the SP,” she said. SHO Shrikant Dwivedi said following the SP’s order, the accused was booked under sections 376 (rape), 377 (unnatural sex), 307 (attempt to kill), 323 (causing hurt), 328 (administering to a person intoxicating drug with intent to commit offence) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. The accused is on the run, he added.

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC orders society member holding up redevelopment to vacate||MUMBAI: Bombay high court directed a society member, who had been obstructing a redevelopment project for six years, to vacate his flat in a dilapidated building in Goregaon by April 30. The court said he must “bend the knee to the law,” to the high court judgement and to “discipline of the Cooperative Societies Act and supremacy of the general body.” Justice Gautam Patel said the law is that “a member of a cooperative housing society loses his individual identity upon becoming a member, and his identity is subsumed within that society.” “A person cannot both claim the benefits of membership and yet deny the authority of the general body of the society to bind that member by a decision taken by majority in a properly convened meeting… It is simply not possible for a member of the society to disobey, disavow or flout openly taken decisions of the general body of the very society of which he claims to be a member,” the judge added. Justice Patel’s judgement was in an arbitration petition filed this year— Chirag Infra Projects Pvt Ltd versus Vijay Jwala Cooperative Housing Society and its member. In 2014, the society resolved to go in for redevelopment. In 2015, a development agreement was signed, said lawyers Amogh Singh for the developer and Amol Joshi for the society. Advocate Divya Parmar for the solitary dissenter raised a legal point. The member, who continues to reside with his wife in his flat, said the development agreement and an arbitration clause cannot bind him as he had not signed the agreement. The member contended the redevelopment was “illegal” as the building, meant for the lower income group, did not have the requisite permission from the social welfare department. The HC said nowhere has he shown how the SWD has the power over development projects. The HC also said he had not challenged the development agreement and it was too late to do that now. The HC said it has the jurisdiction to pass interim orders even against dissenting members who are not party to the arbitration agreement. “The facts are beyond shocking,’’ said Justice Patel. “It does not seem to matter to this member that his actions come at a very real cost to other members, all 19 of whom have vacated their premises in November 2018,” the HC judgment of March 12 said. It added between December 16, 2015 and today, the developer had spent about Rs 6.2 crore, and yet the building had not been demolished only for want of eviction of a sole member. In 2018, the BMC categorised the building as C1 (unsafe and posing a risk to all occupants). The HC declined an eight-week stay sought by the man. Failure to meet the deadline would mean forcible eviction by a court receiver with police help, said the ruling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-orders-society-member-holding-up-redevpt-to-vacate-in-mumbai/articleshow/81538505.cms||Swati Deshpande

A formal reply regarding the department was also conveyed to the Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday, in response to the plea filed a murder convict seeking premature release by counting the period of special parole availed by him during the pandemic. As per the prisons department, in view of various representations received from convicts regarding counting special parole period in the sentence, it placed the matter before the high powered committee in a meeting on November 12, 2020. The committee had observed, “No specific directions for not counting period special parole towards sentence are required to be made in view of statutory provisions. Authorities are directed to decide this issue in accordance with statutory provisions”. “The prison and its administration is a state subject covered by item-4 under the state list in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and the state government has executive power to legislate on matter relating to these items. Therefore, as per law laid down under the Haryana Good Conduct Prisoners (Temporary Release) Act 1988, parole availed by any prisoner shall not count towards the total period of sentence of a prisoner,” the prison department has decided after considering the observations of the high powered committee and the statutory provisions. A formal reply informing the high court about the decision was submitted through Faridabad jail deputy superintendent Anil Kumar. The reply was filed in response to a petition filed by Subhash, 44, a murder convict undergoing sentence at Faridabad jail. He is on special parole since April 3, 2020, and was to surrender on March 24, 2021. As he had completed more than 13 years’ imprisonment, he approached the high court seeking premature release in accordance with The Haryana Government Premature Release Policy dated August 8, 2000. The HC has been informed that the petitioner is not entitled to treat the period spent on special parole as the period undergone in custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/special-parole-during-pandemic-not-to-be-counted-for-premature-release-hc-told/articleshow/81538483.cms||Ajay Sura

The project on the 12m-wide stretch will be implemented under the supervision of the office of the principal scientific adviser to the central government. “A high-level meeting was called by the EDMC commissioner to review the project report,” EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain said. The report has been submitted to the principal scientific adviser’s office. The civic body will provide the waste for the project while it will be funded and implemented by the Centre. “The project will be funded under the Waste to Wealth Mission of the central government. The inert sample has already been collected to compare its strength with soil,” Jain added. Centre Road Research Institute (CRRI) had condcuted a study earlier and a senior technical team from the central office, along with senior representatives of EDMC and CRRI, visited three sites on March 1 “to finalise the location for the country’s first municipal solid waste to road project”, the mayor said. Being a pilot project, it doesn’t need the EDMC House’s approval, Jain pointed out. EDMC will supply 25,000 tonnes of legacy waste from Ghazipur landfill after processing. “At least 3,000 tonnes of legacy waste is processed at the landfill every day now,” said an official. Earlier, the municipal corporation had signed an MoU with National Highway Authority of India for supplying processed legacy waste for filling the embankment of Delhi-Meerut Expressway, but it didn’t materialise due to apprehension over the strength of the material.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-to-pave-800m-of-east-delhi-road-from-waste/articleshow/81557883.cms||Vibha Sharma

Assistant inspector Hanumant Gaikwad on Tuesday said, “The identity of the victim was initially unknown.

He had walked out of the centre with his bag on the evening of March 11. His whereabouts were not known since then. The centre officials had not registered a missing person’s complaint with police.

Among the top 10 districts with highest caseload in the country, eight are in Maharashtra.  “As on March 12, only 23.9 lakh vaccinations have been administered as part of Covid-19 vaccination drive, thereby leaving adequate stocks available with the state for increasing the pace of vaccination and for focussing the vaccination effort for eligible beneficiaries in districts showing an active case surge,” Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a letter to the state chief secretary. “Testing has to be augmented to bring the test positivity rate to less than 5%. Whereas mainstay of testing shall be RT-PCR, the state should also utilise RAT kits as per ICMR guidance especially in containment zones and high-risk settings like super-spreader events, bus stops, railway stations, slums, densely populated areas etc,” he said. The letter dwelt primarily on a report submitted by a central team that went to the state earlier this month and found that the positivity report ranged from 5% in Mumbai to an alarming 30% in Aurangabad. The report also underlined the need to strengthen surveillance, testing and contact tracing. Since the last fortnight, Maharashtra has been reporting a daily increase of over 10,000 cases, which has risen to 15,000 in the past few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtracentre-tells-state-use-antigen-kits-at-rly-stns/articleshow/81538511.cms||Sushmi Dey

The accused have been identified as 29-year-old Priyawart alias Kala and Rohit (23), both residents of Katewada village in Delhi. Police said Priyawart, a known criminal of Bawana, was wanted in at least seven criminal cases, including recent murder of a civil defence volunteer, who was killed earlier this month. DCP (Special Cell) Manishi Chandra said his teams were stationed in five states to monitor the movement of the suspects. “We were tipped off on Monday about Priyawart and Rohit staying at a hotel in Park Street, Jaipur. Accordingly, a team rushed to the address, nabbed the men and brought them to Delhi. Two firearms were recovered from their hideout in Delhi,” Chandra said. The DCP added that the duo had taken refuge in Rajasthan after committing a series of crime, including four murders. “A reward of Rs 2 lakh had been recommended for the arrest of Priyawart in two different murders reported from Bawana and Chhawla earlier,” he said. Charting out Priyawart’s recent involvement, the DCP said he had abducted and killed a civil defence volunteer on March 7 in Bawana.

---||Kolkata||‘Respect sanctity of Coffee House’||Kolkata: The heat of Bengal’s electoral battle on Tuesday reached the iconic Coffee House on College Street. The campaigners of ‘No Vote to BJP’ on Tuesday afternoon raised slogans and got into a minor scuffle with some Coffee House aficionados. The latter had condemned Monday’s slogan shouting by BJP supporters as well and wanted Coffee House to be kept out of the political mudslinging. On Monday afternoon a group of BJP supporters clad in saffron T-shirts entered the Coffee House and defaced some posters saying No-Vote-to-BJP. They allegedly shouted slogans in the name of Narendra Modi. The t-shirts bore slogans like ‘Modi Para.’ The sudden flash mob campaign was allegedly led by the controversial BJP leader Tejinder Singh Bagga. In protest against this “saffron hooliganism,’’ different individuals gathered in front of Coffee House on Tuesday under the banner of ‘No Vote to BJP’. “We strongly condemns such hooliganism in the name of campaigning and heckling of activists,” the group said in a statement. However, some Coffee House lovers protested against the counter slogans inside the hall. “Monday’s incident is condemnable. But it is unfortunate that those who protested it acted in the same manner. Why can’t people respect the sanctity of Coffee House,” said Prabir Bhattacharya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/respect-sanctity-of-coffee-house/articleshow/81537221.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kochi||Rooster sacrifice: Cops to take action||Thrissur: A group of people performed ‘kozhi bali’ (rooster sacrifice) at the Kodungallur Sree Kurumba Temple on Tuesday, defying an official ban against it. The assistant commissioner of the Cochin Devaswom Board Sunil Kartha said the temple authorities have filed a complaint with the police against this. Rooster sacrifice was being performed at the temple earlier, but the practice was banned two decades ago following protests from various sections who described the ritual as barbaric. Subsequently, the ‘kozhikkallu modal’ ritual was being performed there annually. The ritual involves covering the ‘balikkallu’ with mud first, and subsequently a red sheet of cloth will be spread over it and live roosters placed over it. The roosters will be thrown into the air after the ritual, the temple officials said. Kodungallur CI Sony Mathai said four people were reportedly involved in the ‘kozhi bali’ ritual held on Tuesday morning. They have been identified using CCTV visuals and we should be able to arrest them on Wednesday, the CI said.However, the devaswom officials conceded that the punishment involved for violating the ban against rooster sacrifice was only meagre, and the offenders need to remit a fine of Rs 500 only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rooster-sacrifice-cops-to-take-action/articleshow/81537224.cms||T Ramavarman

Bapusaheb Nagargoje, medical superintendent of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) said they have started various measures, like increasing tracing of high-risk contacts of positive patients and conducting more RT-PCR tests, to curb the spread of the infection. “With the rise in the number of patients being admitted in Bytco and Zakir Hussan hospitals —the two civic-run Covid hospitals, it is mandatory to hire more health staff. Additional staff will also be required if the NMC reopens some of its Covid care centres (CCCs),” said Nagargoje. In July last year, the NMC had recruited around 526 health staff on a temporary basis to treat Covid-19 patients at its nine CCCs and two Covid hospitals. Initially, they were appointed for three months but their contract was extended till January this year. After the Covid-19 cases dropped in the city, the NMC closed all the nine CCCs. Moreover, the number of patients admitted in Bytco and Zakir Hussain hospitals had also reduced significantly by January-end. Hence, the NMC had released all the 526 temporary health staff after the termination of their contract. However, after Covid-19 cases again started increasing in the city, the NMC recalled the services of the temporary staff. While 240 staff, including lab technicians, doctors, nurses and ward boys, joined by the second half of February, 200 more are expected to join within a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/surge-in-cases-activates-nmcs-hiring-spree/articleshow/81537216.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Lucknow||TMC goons would be punished when BJP forms govt: Yogi||Parading the kin of three slain BJP workers on the dais at an election rally in Bengal’s Purulia on Tuesday, UP CM Yogi Adityanath declared the end of “anarchy” in Bengal was near and that goons allegedly harboured by Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool would be brought to book once his party came to office in the state. The remarks drew a retort from TMC MP Mahua Moitra. “So Yogi comes to WB, says he will kill ‘TMC goondas’ one by one. Gudduji – listen up – your thok do culture... doesn’t work here,” she said. “May 2 ke baad TMC ki vidai sunishchit hai. Yeh TMC ke gunday, yeh kanoon ko nahi maante…Jab BJP ki sarkar aayegi to in goondon ko chun chun ke saza dilwayi jayegi (TMC’s departure is certain after May 2," Yogi said in Purulia. “TMC goons know no law, but when BJP comes to power, all these goons will be punished," Yogi added. Besides Purulia, the UP CM addressed rallies in Bankura and West Medinipur districts, lacing his speeches with references to the alleged culture of "tolabaazi (extortion)" and "cut money" under TMC. Harking back to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Yogi said such was Trinamool's alleged intolerance that he was stopped from campaigning in Purulia. He had then landed in Jharkhand before driving down 35km to reach Purulia. "There is no stopping misuse of power in West Bengal even today," he said, claiming that scores of BJP supporters had been stopped from reaching the venue of his rally. Yogi claimed Bengal CM Mamata's alleged dislike for the "Jai Shri Ram" chant had translated into restricting people from using it. "Those who try to separate people from Ram get routed from power," he said, accusing the state government of playing with the sentiments of Hindus. The CM said there was already a precedent of "Ram Virodhi (anti-Ram)" governments being driven out of power in UP. Yogi said that before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, there were many people who thought that visiting temples would put secularism in danger. "But now things have changed. Even Mamata Didi is visiting temples and reciting Chandi Path (invocation to the mother goddess)," he said. "Yeh Parivartan hai na. Yeh hai naya Bharat…har vyakti ko Bhagwan ki sharan mein jaana hi padega (This is the change. This is new India. Everybody will have to be at God's feet)." On former Congress president Rahul Gandhi going on a "temple run" during elections, Yogi said opposition leaders being forced to visit shrines was no less than a "Vaicharik vijay (ideological victory)" for BJP. Hailing Bengal as a land of Sanskritik Rashtravad (cultural nationalism), Yogi said that the state had produced stalwarts like Ram Krishna Paramhansa, Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda and Subhash Chandra Bose. "The state was poised to be an axis of development at the time of Independence. Unfortunately, Congress, the communists and then TMC rendered it hollow. The prestige of the state is under threat." Yogi accused TMC of depriving people of the benefits of welfare scheme initiated by the Narendra Modi government. "This is because TMC goons do not allow the schemes to get implemented," he said. BJP's saffron mascot also accused the TMC government of allowing rampant cow slaughter. He claimed that a minister in the Mamata cabinet had been lately advocating cow slaughter. "He should have been immediately sacked. But that was not done since the TMC chief herself has been supporting such people."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tmc-goons-would-be-punished-when-bjp-forms-govt-yogi/articleshow/81539715.cms||Pankaj Shah

Tuesday’s vaccinations include 63,291 first doses and 3,711 second doses. So far, neighbouring Punjab has given 3,95,006 jabs and Himachal Pradesh 2,58,290 jabs. The high turnout of beneficiaries in Haryana is said to be a fallout of the vaccination drive carried out on Monday in which 1.5 lakh people received the Covid vaccine. Meanwhile, the state recorded 523 new cases and two deaths during the day. IDSP director Dr Usha Gupta admitted to an increase in number of cases. She said frequent inter-district movement and the proximity of districts to neighboring Punjab and Chandigarh as the reason for the high number of cases in Panchkula and other northern districts of Haryana. “We are making efforts to keep this trend under control. We have increased containment zones, testing and contact tracing. Rest, residents too have been asked to take all precautions,’’ said Dr Gupta. The state also recorded 249 recoveries. With this, the state’s tally for Covid-19 has reached 2,76,080 cases, 3,079 deaths, 2,69,517 recoveries and 3,484 active cases. A death each has been reported from Karnal and Panipat districts.

He made financial contribution and organised the wedding. Priyanka, 23, was working for the last five years in the shop of H Raja Mohamed, 45, who considered her as his family. After the death of her father, she left her mother a few months ago following some differences. Not only did Mohamed give her shelter, he consulted her family members and fixed her marriage with a Hindu groom. “Her family was unable to afford her marriage following which I took up the responsibility,” said Mohamed. More than a staff member, she is like my daughter, said Mohamed who was moved by her responsible nature. As she is the sole breadwinner in her family, she was struggling to spend on her marriage, so Mohamed made a financial contribution. The wedding of Priyanka with Vijay Kumar was solemnised on March 11 in Visalatchi Amman temple near Orthanadu with Hindu rituals. “She got both her elder sisters married. However, she couldn’t get back the love from her family so I wanted to do it on their behalf,” Mohamed said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/muslim-man-helps-hindu-girl-get-married/articleshow/81538515.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Naidu, ex-mantri get CID notice in Amaravati deal||Vijayawada: Authorities probing the alleged land scam in the proposed capital city Amaravati have summoned former chief minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N Chandrababu Naidu and former municipal minister P Narayana for questioning on March 23. The AP Crime Investigation Department (CID) served the notices in Hyderabad on Tuesday, asking both to appear before the CID regional office in Vijayawada. Naidu and Narayana have been accused of indulging in insider trading in land parcels in Amaravati. They were also booked under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Naidu’s son and TDP general secretary Nara Lokesh said the case was ‘silly’, pointing to the Andhra Pradesh high court’s earlier judgment on January 19 dismissing the insider trading case while observing there was ‘no evidence’. “After searching for 21 months, based on (Alla Ramakrishna) Reddy’s complaint, they have stooped low to file an SC/ST case,” Lokesh tweeted. So far, the CID has booked close to 20 cases against TDP leaders and real estate developers alleging that they were involved in insider trading. The new notices relate to a fresh FIR registered against Naidu and Narayana on March 12 in the case. The notices were issued under CrPC Section 41. The FIR was registered based on a complaint filed by Alla Ramakrishna Reddy, YSRCP legislator from Mangalagiri, on February 25. The FIR mentions that the case was filed after a DSP-rank officer, who is investigating the complaint, submitted a preliminary report on March 12. Naidu is booked as accused No.1 in the FIR. Narayana is listed as accused No. 2. The CID has invoked Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 166 (public servant disobeying law), 167 (public servant framing an incorrect document), and 217 (public servant disobeying direction of law) of IPC, Section 3 (1) (f), (g) of SC and ST (POA) Act and also Section 7 of AP Assigned Land Act 1977. The YSRCP MLA in his complaint alleged that he had received representation from a few residents of his constituency that some of the “influential persons of the then government had cheated them by taking away their land illegally”. The FIR claimed that the complainant (Ramakrishna) had verified the government orders issued by the then government and found several irregularities committed by the accused causing ‘irreparable loss’ to the SC and ST community and weaker sections. After the additional director-general of police (CID) received the complaint, he had appointed DSP S Surya Bhaskar Rao to conduct a preliminary inquiry and submit a report. The preliminary report stated that cognisance of offence was carried out and based on that the ADGP, CID, ordered to register a case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/naidu-ex-mantri-get-cid-notice-in-amaravati-deal/articleshow/81539749.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The woman’s photo was picked up from her social media accounts without her permission. On a written complaint received from general secretary in-charge of Punjab Congress office, Capt Sandeep Sandhu to the director, bureau of investigation, the FIR has been registered under Section 509 of the IPC (intending to insult modesty of a woman), Section 4 and 6 of the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986 and Sections 66 and 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, at the cyber crime cell in Mohali. Punjab police spokesman said distribution of such malicious content on social media, including news websites and TV channels, is against the law and advised people to refrain from spreading lies. In his complaint, Capt Sandhu termed contents of the messages as “defamatory and derogatory insinuations against the chief minister and a lady from Malerkotla who happens to be an acquaintance of the chief minister’s relative.” He added that these social media messages were “offensive, salacious and repulsive” and clearly circulated for character assassination of the chief minister. Seeking directions to track the source and origin of these messages at the earliest, Capt Sandhu said, “the role of certain political opponents of the chief minister in spreading this derogatory message, ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, cannot be ruled out and needs to be investigated.” He submitted that these persons have also “knowingly tarnished the image of the young girl who is just starting out in life.” He pointed out that the use of the woman’s photograph was “tantamount to invasion of privacy, which is a fundamental right.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/police-register-fir-over-social-media-message-defaming-cm-young-woman/articleshow/81538533.cms||---

In 2015, a development agreement was signed, said lawyers Amogh Singh for the developer and Amol Joshi for the society. Advocate Divya Parmar for the solitary dissenter raised a legal point. The member, who continues to reside with his wife in his flat, said the development agreement and an arbitration clause cannot bind him as he had not signed the agreement. The member contended the redevelopment was “illegal” as the building, meant for the lower income group, did not have the requisite permission from the social welfare department. The HC said nowhere has he shown how the SWD has the power over development projects. The HC also said he had not challenged the development agreement and it was too late to do that now. The HC said it has the jurisdiction to pass interim orders even against dissenting members who are not party to the arbitration agreement. “The facts are beyond shocking,’’ said Justice Patel. “It does not seem to matter to this member that his actions come at a very real cost to other members, all 19 of whom have vacated their premises in November 2018,” the HC judgment of March 12 said. It added between December 16, 2015 and today, the developer had spent about Rs 6.2 crore, and yet the building had not been demolished only for want of eviction of a sole member. In 2018, the BMC categorised the building, which stands on a Mhada plot, as C1 (unsafe and posing a risk to all occupants). The HC declined an eight-week stay sought by the man. Failure to meet the deadline would mean forcible eviction by a court receiver with police help, said the ruling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hc-orders-society-member-holding-up-redevpt-to-vacate/articleshow/81538531.cms||---

A senior official said the target for this fiscal was Rs 800 crore. “Collecting Rs 800 crore would be a challenge in the existing circumstances but the department and its teams are trying their best to increase collection through various means such as visiting properties with high tax potential, settling litigation cases under the amnesty scheme and giving relaxation to regular tax payers,” he said. The corporation is even taking help of celebrities such as actors Dalip Tahil and Rajpal Yadav to inspire people to regularise their tax payment, he added. Meanwhile, the civic body has suspended two property tax inspectors for “dereliction of duty” in Narela and Keshavpuram zones last week. The mayor said that to increase revenue, property tax targets were given to each official but there was zero collection in certain places for a week. “There was no collection for five consecutive days despite the fact that there were many properties/farm houses in Narela and Keshavpuram zones, which did not pay the taxes,” said mayor Jai Prakash. An inquiry found many loopholes and the action was taken, he added. All property tax inspectors have been told to fulfil their targets. “We have come across cases where property tax has been submitted for two floors instead of the existing four floors. Regular review meetings are also done to assess the collection status,” said Prakash. In certain wards such as Sadar Bazar, Rs 10-15 crore has been collected as advance property tax till March 15. “We expect property tax officials in other wards to put best of their efforts as we need funds to pay pending salaries,” said the mayor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-crosses-last-yrs-property-tax-collection-targets-rs-800cr-mop-up/articleshow/81538554.cms||Vibha Sharma

We have, for instance, initiated action against actor Gauhar Khan for stepping out despite testing positive,” said Dr Gomare. BMC has asked housing colonies to share CCTV footage of patients breaking home quarantine or isolation rules. “We are being forced to take action as people are not observing Covid rules,” she said. At the state level, Pune circle – an administrative area which covers adjoining districts – added the highest cases (3,994) while Akola circle added the highest fatalities (20).

---||Pune||Pune: Six techies among 9 held on charge of stealing data of private banks’ accounts||PUNE: The city cybercrime police have arrested nine persons, including six software engineers and a woman, on the charge of stealing sensitive pan-India data such as net banking PINs of some private bank account holders and trading the information with buyers in a bid to siphon off funds. A preliminary police assessment has pegged the total money lying in these accounts at Rs216 crore. “Four of the techies stole the data and the remaining five — two software engineers and three stock brokers/traders — were the buyers. These five persons had fallen through bad times after losing jobs and earning opportunities during the Covid-19 lockdown. They had promised the four techies to pay for the data from their savings and also in the form of commission from the money they would have received by siphoning off the funds from the accounts,” said a police officer associated with the investigation. “Most of these accounts were lying dormant for the past few years,” deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake told TOI. The data included names of the account holders, account numbers, names of the branch and also the personal identification numbers (PINs), she said. “The arrested suspects are from Hyderabad, Aurangabad, Surat, Pune and other places and had gathered in a flat on Sinhagad road for trading the stolen data,” Navatake said. Acting on a tip-off, assistant commissioner of police (cyber) Shivaji Pawar, inspectors Rajkumar Waghchaure, Kumar Ghadge, Mahadev Kumbhar, sub-inspector Sagar Padwal and their teams laid a trap around a housing society in Maharshinagar on Monday night. A police team spotted a sports utility vehicle (SUV) reaching the spot and a man, whose description they had received in the tip-off, getting down from the car. Within a few minutes, four men and a woman reached the spot on two-wheelers and in a car. The police team detained them for questioning. The police said one of the arrested suspects, Rohan Ravindra Mankani, was into film production. After obtaining more information from the six persons, the police raided a flat on Sinhagad Road and found a man, Sudhir Shantilal Bhatewara, alias Jain, there. The police took him into custody and seized Rs 25lakh from the flat. The police then obtained more information to the effect that two more suspects from Gujarat were present at a railway station in Mumbai. The police team then went to Mumbai and arrested them. Navatake said, “Most of these dormant accounts were with two leading private banks and their critical data was stolen by the techies. They wanted to sell the data to persons willing to transfer the cash to their accounts from these dormant accounts.” The seized Rs25lakh was part of the cash payment the buyers had given to those who had stolen the data. In the night-long operation, the police seized Rs25 lakh, two four-wheelers, a scooter and 11 cellphones, collectively worth Rs43.54 lakh. “This is a big preventive action by the police before a major cybercrime could take place. We will also write to the top bosses of the private banks, questioning them about the safety of their customers’ data,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/six-techies-among-nine-held-on-charge-of-stealing-pan-india-data-of-account-holders-of-private-banks/articleshow/81538567.cms||Gitesh Shelke

The turmeric board issue had attracted national attention also because several farmers from Nizamabad went to file their nominations in Varanasi against Prime Minister Narendra Modi to highlight their demand in 2019 polls. Union minister of state for agriculture Parshottam Rupala on Tuesday said a Spice Board already exists for 50 spices and the government was of the opinion that an exclusive board was not required for a single spice (turmeric) as of now. He said this in the Lok Sabha during question hour. He was replying to a question by Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy of the Congress, who said BJP leaders Rajnath Singh, Prakash Javadekar and Ram Madhav had promised setting up of a turmeric board during their election campaign in Telangana. In the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, BJP candidate Dharmapuri Arvind had given a written promise on a bond paper that he would convince the Centre to set up the Turmeric Board in Nizamabad if he was elected as MP and won the seat defeating Kavitha. The turmeric farmers from Nizamabad are now demanding that Arvind should resign for failing to fulfill his promise. “Arvind should resign to exert pressure on the BJP government for a turmeric board. The farmers fraternity will ensure his win again if he is able to get a turmeric board,” said Venkatesh Kola, a turmeric farmer who contested the 2019 Lok Sabha poll against Kavitha. However, Arvind said the divisional office of the Spices Board in Nizamabad has been upgraded to a regional office-cum-extension centre. “This regional office has been given more functions and powers than the turmeric board would have. The government has taken several initiatives for the welfare of turmeric farmers and is promoting new varieties of the spice. After three new farm laws come into effect, the role of Board would minimise as farmers would be all powerful,” he said. The ruling TRS and the Congress party tore into Arvind over the issue. “He derived political advantage by projecting that he would bring turmeric board here and now he should explain to the farmers his stand. He had misled the farmers and now has to face their wrath,” said Telangana State Planning Board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar of the TRS. Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy questioned the logic of not giving a turmeric board. “There is no great financial cost. Land has already been allotted by the previous government. The turmeric farmers are neither getting Minimum Support Price nor any market intervention. Turmeric is a high cost export crop wherein farmers invest about Rs. 1.5 lakh per acre,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-separate-turmeric-board-in-t-says-centre-farmers-fume/articleshow/81539825.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Lucknow||UP panchayat elections 2021: BJP to cash in on ‘Mann Ki Baat’||LUCKNOW: The state BJP would use Prime Minister’s radio programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’ as a tool to increase the party’s outreach among voters both in urban and rural areas. With eyes set on both the panchayat poll and the 2022 Vidhan Sabha elections, the UP BJP is working to bolster its connect with voters. And what comes handy for the party is Prime Minister’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ and his popularity among the masses. As the PM in his show covers multiple issues ranging from agriculture to environment conservation and often highlights common people doing exemplary things the BJP has decided to use it for its voter outreach programme. “It can go a long way in mobilising voters, mainly in rural areas. Success in the panchayat election will prove the party has a huge base in rural areas,” said a senior party functionary.  Starting from the booth level, which is the smallest unit of the political organisations, the party workers would ensure that everyone tunes in to ‘Mann Ki Baat’. As part of its strategy to make the programme popular among rural and urban masses, the party last month had conducted a booth level survey to assess how many listeners tune in to the programme. The party has already prepared reports for every region. In most of the regions, on an average at least 80% people listen to the ‘Mann Ki Baat’. Booth-level committees had uploaded pictures on their WhatsApp group to support the claim.  The remaining 20% would also be brought to the fold. Booth level committees, having 21 members each, will have to ensure that everyone should tune in to the programme. The committees will hold their monthly meetings the same day when the programme is broadcast. Besides, to ensure better connect with voters, the party has issued instructions for organising various programmes from April 6 to February 11 next year which is Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyay’s death anniversary. Ambedkar Jayanti on April 14, Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee Balidan Diwas on June 23, Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyay Jayanti on September 25 and Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s birth anniversary on December 25 are other special days on the party’s list of programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/panchayat-election-bjp-to-cash-in-on-mann-ki-baat/articleshow/81539778.cms||Neha Shukla
