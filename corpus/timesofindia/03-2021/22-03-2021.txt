However, because of the pandemic, it was up to the student board to take it upon themselves to ensure that safety was a priority right and prepared for the same. Regular temperature checks apart, the student body tells us how they worked their way around their events. The college also had specifically appointed volunteers whose job was to ensure all students had their masks on while they were out on campus and at the auditoriums. “This year, Lasya is a bigger event, but in a smaller scale. For instance, instead of it being our regular two-day event, we spaced it out as a three-day event,” says Tanish Kumar Jain, a co-ordinator at the college. The students also split their events into two systems. “One set of events were held online and another was held offline. So, students from colleges outside Bengaluru or outside Karnataka took part in the online events, and students from some of the colleges in Bengaluru took part in the offline events,” explains Sudhanva, yet another co-ordinator. Festing is a big deal right now. It’s great to be back: Participating students We had come to Lasya last year as well. This year, even though we are in the middle of a pandemic, the energy and vibe of the festival is the same. But the college here is taking all the necessary precautions. For instance, I was part of the fashion event, and the organisers gave us guidelines on how to use the green room. We were asked to come to the college at a specific time, so that we do not all end up in the green room at the same time. We were also asked to come in already dressed for the event. And between our time slots, the organisers ensured all the rooms, as well as the stage area was being sanitised between each session. — Saksha, student of St Josephs College This is how we did it: Student organisers Every year, at fests, we usually have so much crowd. But this year, everything is so different. But with the way we have organised our fest this year, we have proved to everyone that we can still have fun even without having a mass gathering. We had multiple colour-coded bands. We divided our entire day into three slots — morning, afternoon and evening. Students who come in for their particular event are given a band. After they finish their event, they are free to leave, as we do not want the space to get over crowded. We are, therefore, following all social responsibilities, safety protocols and having fun. — Harshal J Shah, co-ordinator Watch On-ground college fests are back in Bengaluru…but on a much smaller scale||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/on-ground-college-fests-are-back-in-bengalurubut-on-a-much-smaller-scale/articleshow/81619979.cms||---

Official sources said the meeting was against protocol as it was not approved by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and that the same will be conveyed to the chief minister. "He shouldn’t have done it but it’s possible he wasn’t aware of the protocol. It will be conveyed to him," said a source. Significantly, Zin ceased to be the foreign minister after the coup in Myanmar earlier this year. The incumbent foreign minister is Wunna Maung Lwin who was appointment by Myanmar military’s State Administration Council after the coup. "Had a fruitful meeting (online) this morning with Zin Mar Aung, Hon'ble Foreign Minister, Myanmar. Our thoughts and prayers are with Myanmar in these trying times," the chief minister tweeted, announcing his virtual meeting. He also tagged the union home minister, Amit Shah, and Indian embassy in Myanmar in the tweet. The CM had earlier written to PM Narendra Modi asking him to intervene and ensure asylum for fleeing refugees who shared ethnic ties with the people of Mizoram. ``I understand that there are certain foreign policy issues where India needs to proceed cautiously. However, we cannot ignore this humanitarian crisis," he had said in the letter. India’s position on the new military rule in Myanmar so far has been ambiguous even as it has said the recent developments in the country are a matter of deep concern and that it has direct stakes in the maintenance of peace and stability in the country. The government has also said that the safety and well-being of the people of Myanmar remains a priority. According to a report from Aizawl, the two leaders discussed the current political situation in Myanmar. “The meeting was to extend solidarity and call for peace among the Zo ethnic people of Myanmar who have become victims of persecution and atrocities after the military junta took power in the neighbouring country,’’ an official of the CM office was quoted as saying. An agency report said more than 500 people from the neighbouring country had crossed over to Mizoram in the last few weeks, even as the Centre directed the four Myanmar- bordering northeastern states to prevent illegal immigration and ensure expeditious deportation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mizoram-cm-holds-meeting-with-foreign-minister-of-myanmar-riles-centre/articleshow/81620664.cms||Sachin Parashar

---||India||Ashoka University says it will ‘rectify lapses in institutional processes’||NEW DELHI: Ashoka University broke its silence on Sunday to “express deep regret at the recent events surrounding the resignations of Prof Pratap Bhanu Mehta and Prof Arvind Subramanian” and to “acknowledge there have been some lapses in institutional processes, which we will rectify in consultation with all stakeholders”. “This will reaffirm our commitment to academic autonomy and freedom which have always been at the core of the Ashoka University ideals,” said a statement issued jointly by Chancellor Rudrangshu Mukherjee, vice-chancellor Malabika Sarkar, chairman of board of trustees Ashish Dhawan, and, interestingly, Mehta and Subramanian. The concluding line in the statement that Mehta and Subramanian “will remain available for advice and consultation to the university in the future” was a signal that neither Mehta nor Subramanian will be returning to the faculty positions they’ve quit. The last one week has been tumultuous for Ashoka, which opened its doors in 2014 as India’s first liberal arts university with private capital. First Mehta resigned and in a letter to the vice-chancellor, said, “After a meeting with the founders, it has become abundantly clear to me that my association with the university may be considered a political liability. My public writing in support of a politics that tries to honour constitutional values of freedom and equal respect for all citizens is perceived to carry risks for the university…It is clear it is time for me to leave Ashoka.” Days later, Arvind Subramanian, who was chief economic adviser in the first Modi government, followed suit saying, “That even Ashoka — with its private status and backing by private capital — can no longer provide a space for academic expression and freedom is ominously disturbing. Above all, that the university’s commitment to fight for and sustain the Ashoka vision is now open to question makes it difficult for me to continue being part of Ashoka.” The Ashoka statement said Mehta and Subramanian “continue to believe strongly that Ashoka University should embody a liberal vision and commitment to academic freedom and autonomy. And they remain lifelong friends and well-wishers of the institution and are committed to its success wherever they are.” In a separate letter to students, faculty, alumni, parents and founders, Mukherjee said, “Ashoka University’s commitment to core values and our founders and trustees’ role are being questioned…I want to respond to this.” “Today when the founders are being attacked for trying to compromise and curtail academic autonomy and freedom of expression, I find it necessary…to state unambiguously that the founders have never interfered with academic freedom: faculty members have been left free to construct their own courses and follow their own methods of teaching and their own methods of assessment. They have also been left free to carry out their own research and publications,” Mukherjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ashoka-university-says-it-will-rectify-lapses-in-institutional-processes/articleshow/81621580.cms||Shradha Chettri

Called ‘Sankalp Patra’ and released by Union home minister Amit Shah, the manifesto takes identitarian politics to new lengths and reflectes the party’s self-avowed confidence that a regime change in Kolkata is imminent. Read AlsoCAA likely to be implemented from January: VijayvargiyaBharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) West Bengal in-charge, Kailash Vijayvargiya on Saturday said that BJP led Centre government will start the process of granting citizenship to refugees under Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), from January next year. ​​​​"Most probably from January the process of grantingFor instance, the manifesto promises to regularise the citizenship of refugees immediately after assuming office, an assertion which at once tries to convey fidelity to a poll plank that resonates with a significant section of the electorate. “Refugees have been living here since the 1970s, and are pained at not having citizenship. We will implement CAA in the first cabinet meeting and provide citizenship to them,” Shah said. The document also contains a host of schemes for women and girls. Notable among them was a free education scheme, termed “from KG to PG”, and special bonds to SC, ST and OBC families for girls’ welfare. The manifesto also promises to bring Mahishya, Teli and other Hindu OBCs under the ambit of OBC reservation. On the healthcare front, the party proposed three new AIIMS — in north Bengal, Jangalmahal and the Sunderbans. A Rs 10,000 crore healthcare infrastructure fund was also proposed.

It promises a Tagore Prize “on the lines of the Nobel Prize”, and a Satyajit Ray Award, “on the lines of Oscar”. If voted to office, the party also promised to keep aside Rs 500 crore for Kolkata to get Unesco Heritage City tag. “Refugees have been living here since the 1970s, and are pained at not having citizenship. We will implement CAA in the first cabinet meeting and provide citizenship to them,” Shah said. Stressing on a “zero tolerance to infiltration” policy, he said a special fund would be created for refugees, from which each family would be provided Rs 10,000 per year after they receive citizenship. A corpus of Rs 100 crore was announced for that. Regarding the “KG to PG” scheme, he said there will be a corpus of Rs 500 crore to provide financial assistance to meritorious girls. Apart from a special Rs 50,000 bond for families with a girl child, the manifesto also announced Rs 1 lakh to women from the SC, ST, OBC and economically weaker sections at the time of their wedding. Also, the manifesto promised “free public transport” to women and girls. Apart from establishing specific development boards for the nine Scheduled Tribe communities like Santhals, Oraons, Mundas and Bhumijs, the manifesto also included increased funding to Matua, Rajbangshi, Bauri and the Bagdi development boards. Shah announced a Rs 1,000 crore fund to incentivise weavers, carpenters and tanners. For ST-dominated blocks, Shah announced 200 days’ work under the MGNREGA scheme. The wage for tea garden workers was proposed to be increased to Rs 350 from Rs 176 per day at present. “We will constitute a Sonar Bangla economic revival task force that will formulate new industrial policy to promote Bengal as an investment destination and revive sick industrial units,” Shah said. Assuring to bring Bengal among the top three states in terms of ease of doing business, he said Invest Bangla will be formed on the lines of centrally sponsored Invest India. While all dues of the state government towards MSME units will be cleared, electricity will be provided at Rs 2 per unit for these units. A special corpus of Rs 500 crore was also proposed for collateral-free loans to the units. The manifesto also proposed free electricity — up to 200 units — for domestic consumption and a Rs 30,000 crore fund to be spent over five years to develop infrastructure in 10 cities. Rs 22,000 crore has been earmarked for transforming Kolkata into “a city of future”. “The figure might sound odd to you, but we have made a detailed estimate for that,” Shah said. Rs 1 lakh crore will be spent over five years for development of roads jointly with the centrally sponsored schemes. BJP, which has been facing “outsider” barbs, on Sunday proposed Bengali and local languages as mandatory from Classes 1 to 10 in schools, irrespective of their instruction medium. It also proposed to make Bengali one of the official languages at the United Nations. Shah also proposed Annapurna canteens, where meals would be provided at Rs 5 to all. BJP, which is facing nationwide stir over the three farm laws and a “No Vote to BJP” campaign by farmers’ groups, wooed farmers through a host of schemes: Rs 4,000 per year was promised to landless farmers along with arrears, towards the centrally sponsored PM Kisan scheme. A Rs 20,000-crore corpus was proposed for agriculture infrastructure development and a Rs 5,000-crore corpus was proposed for the right price to farmers. It also proposed Rs 2,000 crore for infrastructure for fishermen and Rs 1,000 crore for development of dairy infrastructure.

The arrested have been identified as Vinayak Shinde (55), a constable convicted for the fake encounter of Chhota Rajan associate Ram Lakhan Bhaiya in 2007, and Naresh Ramniklal Gore (31), a bookie. Shinde, on parole since May 2020, worked with Sachin Waze in a team led by retired encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma.

Earlier in theATS suspects more policemen are involved in the killing prompted by Mansukh’s reluctance to take the rap for planting the explosives. Waze is alleged to have ordered the hit but may not have been present when Mansukh was murdered. The digital trail left by Waze and others in communicating with Mansukh and each other helped ATS nail the suspects. Gore and Shinde were produced before the Thane ATS court, which remanded them in police custody till March 30. ATS chief Jaijeet Singh said bookie Gore had procured five SIM cards and handed them to Shinde who was in touch with Waze since his release on parole. These arrests are merely the tip of the iceberg, said an official, adding that more suspects, mostly cops, will be apprehended in a day or two. The two accused have not only admitted to their role but also spilled the beans on Waze and a few more cops who extended logistics support, the official said.

There are two theories regarding Waze’s reasons for fabricating a terror case. “Waze would crack the case and become a super cop.

The plot to kill Mansukh was hatched on March 2 during a two-hour meeting Waze held with two colleagues at their headquarters near Crawford Market. It was the same day Waze asked Mansukh to draft a letter through an advocate alleging he was under pressure from police and the media, which was not the case. Waze’s phone records have established his location near the Ambani residence on the fateful night, an officer said. To build an alibi, he ensured that he did not receive or make any calls from his personal phone on March 4, the day of the murder, the ATS has told the Thane court. In fact, there were only 8 messages on his mobile even though it was not switched off. All communication with accomplices were through SIM cards procured from Gujarat.

A day after the car was found near the Ambani house, four men from Waze’s team visited Mansukh’s shop in Thane and taken away the digital video recorder linked to his CCTV and installed a new one in its place. Sources said though Waze himself did not take part in killing Mansukh, he was coordinating with the killers and a few cops over the phone. The accused policemen and a few individuals from Thane, who are yet to be arrested, are alleged to have lent logistical support in luring Mansukh to Ghodbunder Road in Thane before attacking him in a moving car and then dumping his body in a Mumbra creek.

---||India||India mulls UN vote on human rights in Lanka||NEW DELHI: As the UNHRC prepares for a vote on Tuesday on a resolution meant to hold Sri Lankan authorities accountable for human rights violations, the Indian government is mulling whether to support or oppose the resolution. Despite repeated calls for support from the island nation, including a phone call to PM Narendra Modi by Sri Lankan president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, India has kept the neighbour in suspense and the final decision is expected to be conveyed to India’s permanent mission in Geneva only on Tuesday morning. India itself has been at the receiving end of commentary from the UNHRC and committees under it on issues ranging from Article 370 to arrested defence middleman Christian Michel. While the government has the option to abstain, it won't be an easy decision with China, Pakistan and Russia likely to vote against the resolution. With elections in Tamil Nadu next month, the decision to support Sri Lanka can be testing for the government. Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram appealed to the government on Saturday to call out Sri Lanka for rights violations by voting in favour of the resolution and show solidarity with the Tamil people. DMK president M K Stalin too urged Modi on Sunday to not take a stand against the resolution. Even as it continues to remind Sri Lanka of its commitment to address the aspirations of Tamils, including through meaningful devolution, India is aware that voting in favour, or perhaps even abstaining during voting on the resolution that calls for Lankan officials to be held accountable for war crimes can further drive the strategically located Indian Ocean country into the arms of China, especially with the Rajapaksas, who are known for their close ties with China, in power. Significantly, as reports from Islamabad confirmed on Sunday, Pakistan has decided to vote against the resolution after a clarification from Lankan authorities that they were not going to ban burqa in Sri Lanka. Pakistan had opposed the proposed ban saying it would “further strengthen wider apprehensions about fundamental human rights of minorities in the country’’. A source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the safest option for India would be to abstain under the circumstances which the government has been doing in any case on country specific resolutions. India believes its “consistent’’ policy on Sri Lanka, as it said at the Council last month, rests on support for Sri Lanka’s unity and territorial integrity and also on an abiding commitment to aspirations of the Tamils of Sri Lanka for equality, justice, peace and dignity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-mulls-un-vote-on-human-rights-in-lanka/articleshow/81622619.cms||---

According to data compiled from all the state-level bankers’ committees (SLBCs), as of December-end (third quarter of this fiscal), Rs 8,263 crore belonging to more than 3.5 lakh accounts that have availed education loans have been classified as non-performing assets (NPAs) out of the total education loan outstanding of Rs 84,965 crore that more than 23.3 lakh accounts borrowed. Stream-wise data shows that of the Rs 84,965 crore total outstanding amount, loans to medical students is Rs 10,147 crore (11.9%), engineering students is Rs 33,316 crore (39.2%), nursing Rs 3,675 crore (4.3%), MBA Rs 9,541 crore (11.2%) and all other streams together Rs 28,286 crore (33.2%). In NPAs against the outstanding loan amount, nursing tops the list with over 14%, followed by 12.1% in engineering, 7.1% in MBA and 6.2% in medical. Other streams together have 8.4% of the outstanding loans as NPAs. Doraswamy C, former convener of Andhra Pradesh SLBC, says: “Education is a priority lending sector, and beneficiaries must be sincere in returning the money they borrowed. But that does not happen in many cases. From evasion to negligence, there are many reasons for this. Besides, delays in interest subsidies payment by the Centre and other systemic problems also hurt honest re-payers.” Education expert AS Seetharamu says: “The time needed to find employment for an engineering student is more than that for a medical professional. Nearly 30% of engineering students drop out annually and campus placements have been dipping. In cases of nurses, most leave the country and the banks don't find them. Visas need to be linked to education loans. Domestically, they avail loans in one place but work in another.” States’ PerformanceFurther, distribution of education NPAs across the country shows that the eastern and southern regions, led by Bihar and Tamil Nadu, have emerged as the worst performers, while northern and western regions are the best. Compared to the national average of 9.7% of NPAs, it is 14.2% in the eastern region and 11.9% in the southern region. It is only 3.3% and 3.9% in the northern and western regions, respectively, while it is 6.1% and 6.8% in the central and northeastern regions. Other SectorsWhile all this data is for the first three quarters of this fiscal, data from previous years shows how the education sector is among the top contributors to NPAs after industry and agriculture. At 21%, 16.7% and 13.6% in fiscals 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, the industry sector tops the table, followed by the agriculture sector — 7.8%, 8.9% and 10.3%. Comparatively, the figures for the education sector stand at 8.1%, 8.3% and 7.6% for the said three years. NPAs in the housing and automobile sectors were under 2% for all years, while it was 2.1%, 2% and 1.5% for the retail sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/education-loans-nurses-engineering-students-have-more-npas-than-mbas-medicos/articleshow/81622856.cms||Chethan Kumar

Responding to PM Narendra Modi’s “TMC thieves” barb, Mamata said, “TMC chor (thief)? Narendra Modi, tomar gaddar-ra chor-er baba (the traitors with you are the father of all thieves). People never forgive traitors. Bengal has not forgiven the Mir Jafars”. Mamata didn’t mention any of the Adhikaris by name, but made no secret of the fact that she felt betrayed. “I had blind faith in them. I had given them my love and affection. In my affection, I couldn’t see the treachery beneath their masks,” she said. “The traitors have made a lot of money. They have made so much money that they have now fled to save it. Else, I would have thrown them out. We will probe the complaint about a Rs 5,000-crore scam in Contai Co-operative Bank”. The CM said the worst part was that the turncoats had brazenly admitted to being in touch with BJP “since 2014”. “I had to take permission to come to East Midnapore. They behaved as if it is their fief or a Centre-governed territory. I can come at will.Whatever development has taken place here in the past decade was done by me and my government, for which the traitors took undue credit,” she said.

The CM reminded party workers at all her three rallies of the day — in Contai South, Contai North and Nandakumar in East Midnapore — to keep a month-long vigil on ballot boxes. “The central and state police will do their job, but it is your responsibility to ensure people’s votes are guarded. Do not eat anything offered by outsiders. If EVMs stop functioning, do not return home; wait till voting resumes,” she said.

---||---||PM to Didi: Kick my head, but won’t let you kick West Bengal dreams||BANKURA: As the battle for Bengal raged on from one rally dais to another, PM Narendra Modi on Sunday put his “head” on the line for “Didi to kick if she wants”, but vowed he wouldn’t let her “kick away Bengal’s dreams”. “They (Trinamool) are drawing pictures showing Didi putting her foot on my head,” Modi said at Bankura’s Tilabedia Maidan, setting up the crowd for another variant of his poll punchline in Bengali. “Didi jachchhe, ashol paribartan ashchhe (Didi is on her way out, real change is coming).” Projecting himself as the harbinger of the change the state needs, the PM said he was being ridiculed by Mamata and her party because they had realised that he means business. He said voters had to only compare the “grim reality” with the CM’s “hollow promises” over the past 10 years to realise why she should go. Modi coined a slogan to explain the difference between BJP and TMC. “BJP runs on schemes, TMC runs on scams,” he said. “They know that central schemes (like Ayushman Bharat and PM Kisan Samman Nidhi) do not offer room for cut money, which is why they are not interested in them.” The PM reeled off a list of schemes a prospective BJP government would take up the day it assumed office. “We will give access to piped drinking water to 1.5 crore people under the Jal-Jiban Mission; people will get free medical support under Ayushman Bharat; you will boost heritage tourism in Bishnupur, known for terracotta temples,” he said. Modi said BJP’s commitment to development goals was reflected in its focus on first-time voters and women. “We have fielded old and new candidates who can help build a double-engine sarkar,” he said. "I appeal to first-time voters to vote for BJP. I won’t let your future go waste like other parties did to the last three generations." The PM capped his promise with his now-familiar forecast, “Khela sesh hobe, vikas arambha hobe (Didi’s game will come to an end, development will begin in Bengal)”.

---||Business||Top-tier IT companies set to continue revenue growth streak||Chennai: Indian Information Technology (IT) service companies are likely to post double-digit revenue growth in the Jan-March period on the back of accelerated digital spends, ramp up of transformation deals, and cloud adoption. IT giant Accenture’s blockbuster February quarter earnings last week indicated a robust demand for digital transformation services and has emerged as a preview for the performance of Indian IT services companies in the quarter ended March 2021, analysts said.Accenture beat street expectations on all fronts, posting a revenue growth 5% year-on-year in constant currency terms for the quarter ended February 2021. The company also increased its revenue growth guidance for fiscal 2021 to 6.5%-8.5% from 4%-6% earlier. “Today we are proud to announce [...] our return to pre-covid level financial results a quarter earlier than we expected and with a tough compare,” Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said in the earnings call. “Accenture’s broad-based positive results are a reflection of general demand acceleration in IT services, a trend which should benefit Indian IT service providers,” Prashant Shukla, VP, Everest Group said. The company’s outsourcing growth has been pulling its overall performance through the crisis, indicating that clients are considering outsourcing service providers as entrusted partnerss, he added. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities expect the Indian IT industry to grow in double digits in FY2022 with select large players growing up to 14%-16% driven by accelerated IT spending and cloud opportunities.“Indian IT companies have seen a significant rebound over the last two quarters helped by the increasing significance of having a strong tech stack at large enterprises, and Accenture's earnings reiterated the fact that this demand remains a structural trend,” analysts at Motilal Oswal said in a note. Accenture's deal wins posted a 13% growth with record bookings in both consulting and outsourcing, at $8 billion each. Outsourcing revenue -a key revenue segment for Indian IT- was $5.65 billion, a 11% increase in constant currency terms. Revenue from the BFSI sector -a big vertical for top tier Indian IT companies- increased by almost 10% for Accenture, the sector’s best performance in the last two years.Accenture’s strong quarterly performance and second-time upward revision in FY21 revenue growth guidance augurs well for Indian IT peers, analysts at Emkay Global said. However, in a competitive environment, attrition remains a worry for the IT sector as it could impact employee costs, analysts added. “The key risk for the sector is potential war for talent as companies seek digital talent to grow,” Kawaljeet Saluja and Sathishkumar S, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities, said. Large companies (specifically Infosys and TCS) have strong training infrastructure and depth to create a talent pool; they are in a position to contain impact from wage revision. Mid-tier companies may be vulnerable, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/top-tier-it-companies-set-to-continue-revenue-growth-streak/articleshow/81621012.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Kolkata||Two schools shut campuses as student, teacher test +ve||Kolkata: Two city school campuses will shut down from Monday after a pre-board exam candidate and a senior teacher tested positive for Covid. La Martiniere for Boys and St Lawrence High School have both sent notices to parents in this regard. In St Lawrence High School, the lab practicals for the higher secondary examination that were scheduled on Monday have been pushed back till the end of the month. The pre-board exams, which are called rehearsal examinations at La Martiniere schools, are ongoing and a student of Class X who was writing these tests has tested positive. The school has announced a shutdown of all offline exams and classes for the moment and the campus will also be shut down. A notice has been sent to parents by principal John Rafi saying the remaining exams will be taken online and classes will go back to the online mode. Teachers have also been asked not to come to the campus for the time being. The notice sent by St Lawrence principal Father Sebastian said the school will stay shut till March 29. The teacher who tested positive used to teach classes VIII, IX and XI. Teachers and parents have expressed concern about contact that might have happened while the classes were on and teachers said an eight-day closure would not have been enough. They felt it may not be safe to come back to the campus on March 29. The school has pushed back the practical examinations to March 30 and 31. “The school is calling us back too early. We should each go for Covid test and teach online,” a teacher said. Father Sebastian said he has reported the matter to the Council. “I will talk to the Council again on Monday. I will be guided by what the Council says,” he said, adding, “We have completed all our practical practice sessions and children will not have a problem facing the practicals directly. We are keeping all our offline classes off and have asked our teachers to go into a complete online teaching mode from Monday.” In La Martiniere, an online exam schedule has been provided, which will be followed from Monday. “I have asked students to not be upset at the development. It is important to complete the rehearsal exams online now and get on with studies as nothing should affect their concentration before the boards,” Rafi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/two-schools-shut-campuses-as-student-teacher-test-ve/articleshow/81620570.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

With the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) and Amaravati Metropolitan Region Development Authority (AMRDA) ignoring road repair works, the condition of the flyover has worsened at Ramavarappadu Ring. Officials have instead set up barricades here to divert vehicles. The Inner Ring Road connecting NH-16 with NH-65 is a key route that reduces traffic in the city. Thousands of vehicles between Hyderabad and Kolkata are diverted through this road without entering the city. The 9.84-kilometre-long road was constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 122.35 crores and inaugurated in June 2016. The Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority played a key role in constructing and maintaining the road. However, the project has not been maintained despite the thousands of heavy vehicles that pass through the road every day. With heavy monsoon rains, foot-deep potholes formed on the road between Payakapuram and Ramavarappadu Ring. No repair works have been taken up in the last six months. “Police are forcefully diverting our heavy vehicles through Inner Ring Road, which is in bad shape. Our vehicle tyres and suspension system are getting damaged. Roads and buildings department should respond and repair the road immediately,” M Ramesh Babu, a truck driver from Palasa, demanded. Meanwhile, potholes on the joints of the flyover pose an additional threat with officials arranging barricades in the middle of the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rough-ride-for-motorists-on-inner-ring-rd/articleshow/81619788.cms||Venu Lanka

Police said Dayanand Yadav (55), an RJD activist and former mukhiya of Daraili Mathiya panchayat in Siwan district, was shot dead on a village road between Tarwan and Pakri under the Darauli police station area around 7pm on Saturday. SHO (incharge) of Darauli police station Mamunur Rashid said Yadav was supposed to contest the upcoming panchayat election for the post of mukhiya. “Preliminary investigations revealed that Yadav was killed over political rivalry. Yadav’s son has lodged an FIR against six of his co-villagers, accusing them of killing his father,” the SHO added. Rashid said Yadav was returning home on a bike when two motorcycle-borne criminals intercepted him and opened fire. “Yadav was rushed to a local hospital, where the doctors declared him brought dead,” Rashid said, adding raids were on to arrest the killers. Meanwhile, two motorcycle-borne criminals shot dead a trader, Vinod Kumar Chaudhary (48), in front of his house at Zero Mile under the Ahiyapur police station area around 9.30pm on Saturday. SHO of Ahiyapur police station Sunil Kumar said Chaudhary owned an electronic and electrical goods shop at Imli Chatti Chowk. “Chaudhary reached home around 9.30pm and rang the doorbell. While his wife Rani Devi was opening the main door, two bike-borne criminals opened fire, killing Chaudhary on the spot. “Rina has lodged an FIR in connection with the incident. She has, however, not named anyone. Efforts are on to identify the killers and arrest them,” the SHO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/former-mukhiya-trader-shot-dead-in-siwan-muz/articleshow/81619741.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Bihar: Woman ‘uses’ marriage as a ploy to extort money in Aurangabad||PATNA: A married woman attempted suicide by consuming poisonous substance near the office of Auragabad SP on Saturday alleging denial of justice by the police. Indu Devi, in her early 30s, was rushed to a government hospital in Gaya where her condition is stated to be out of danger. Aurangabad Town police have lodged a case of attempt to suicide against her. Indu took the step to press for the arrest of her husband Santosh Kumar Singh and in-laws in a dowry harassment case lodged with the Rafiganj police station on February 9. Aurangabad Sadar SDPO Anup Kumar said on Sunday the woman had married Santosh, a physically challenged teacher under Barun block in the district, about three years ago. Santosh, stated to be her third husband, has been arrested and sent to jail in the dowry case. “We don’t know the reason for her attempt to commit suicide. The accused have already been arrested and chargesheet filed in the court concerned against them. No action is pending against the accused in the case,” the SDPO said. Santosh’s father Ashok Singh, a resident of Karsara village under Rafiganj police station, however, alleged that Indu escaped with gold jewellery worth Rs6 lakh and Rs1.75 lakh in cash from the house a couple of weeks after the marriage. On February 9, she lodged a dowry harassment case. A case for maintenance is already pending in a local family court. “She had earlier duped two other people on the pretext of marriage,” Santosh’s brother Vikas Kumar Singh said. “Indu had first married to one Vinod Kumar of Jhalhara under Nabi Nagar police station in Aurangabad district. She had escaped with Rs50,000 and jewellery only a few weeks after their marriage. She had also accused Vinod of harassing her on one pretext or the other. Later, she married one Chandan Kumar of Suja Karma Azad Bigha. After a few years, she lodged a dowry harassment case against Chandan and her in-laws. The case is still pending in the court,” Vikas alleged. The woman’s marries to extort money. She targets persons with physical disabilities. Once the marriage is solemnized, she lodges a dowry harassment case against the husband and other family members, an investigating officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-uses-marriage-as-a-ploy-to-extort-money-in-aurangabad/articleshow/81619734.cms||Ramashankar
---||Business||India Inc backs Aatmanirbhar pitch, vaccine diplomacy, puts focus on job creation||MUMBAI: India Inc has put its weight behind the Aatmanirbhar Bharat campaign and the government’s vaccine diplomacy even as it cited job creation as the biggest challenge facing the country. Captains of industries, during a CEO panel discussion at The Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence 2020 on Saturday, said the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, along with indigenous solutions, digital transformation and clean energy transition will create opportunities and make India an export hub. They also commended vaccine diplomacy. Larsen & Toubro CEO S N Subrahmanyan said that the biggest crisis facing India today is the creation of jobs. “...and like the famous economist John Keynes suggested,” Subrahmanyan said, “holes may have to be dug in the ground and then filled up with concrete and steel, hoping that it enables job creation.” “The PLI scheme, monetary easing and feel-good factor of not relying on other countries will lead to indigenous solutions for supply chain problems,” he said, adding that China is not the only country that can provide cost-effective economical solutions. JSW Group chairman Sajjan Jindal said that after the border tension, the steel-to-sports conglomerate stopped imports from China. “The good fallout of that is that a lot of industries have come up, which are now supplying to us.” Jindal expressed hope that the government does not come down heavily on inflation pressures by restricting the growth in the economy. In his welcome speech, Times Group MD Vineet Jain said that businesses that are inherently more vulnerable than others in a crisis such as this need an economic stimulus to stay viable. These businesses included hospitality, real estate, and media. He also called for avoiding large-scale lockdowns as authorities address the emerging second wave of Covid. “It’ll hit small and medium businesses, and the millions of people they employ, the hardest. What we need is strict enforcement of Covid protocols, targeted containment, and vaccination on a war-footing,” he said. The job uncertainty triggered by Covid has highlighted the need for social security, said HDFC Life Insurance MD Vibha Padalkar. Large sections of the workforce are in sectors that still do not have an assured pension. Pension assets as a percentage of GDP are less than 5%, which is woefully inadequate. If India is saving less, it most certainly has been spending and shopping more. Customers have structurally moved towards shopping online. Pretty much 100% of pin codes in India shop online now, and even in terms of the diversity of stuff that they buy, said Amazon India head Amit Agarwal. He highlighted that entrepreneurs have been coming up with specific need-based products and online has been an enabler to their businesses. Amazon saw 1.5 lakh businesses come online for the first time during the pandemic. A third of that came online using a non-English language. As many as 70,000 became exporters, creating global brands and shipping products that exceeded $2 billion in value. “An Aatmanirbhar Bharat has to start with an Aatmanirbhar Indian, and that implies unleashing the potential of every citizen,” Agarwal said. Jindal also said that India has a unique opportunity to lead the transition from a fossil-fuel economy to a green energy one. “If the government takes a view to make India coal-free by 2025 or 2030, where Coal India and coal mining must shut down, it will be a big statement. But this is something that we as a country need to do,” Jindal said. A lot of companies are doing the R&D and JSW Steel is also working overtime to see how it can convert existing steel plants and reduce its carbon footprint. It is looking at hydrogen as a possible solution, the business tycoon said. Bhavish Aggarwal, co-founder of ride-hailing firm Ola, said Covid has changed the way societies see climate change risks. Not just India, governments around the world have pledged their support for transition to sustainable mobility and sustainable energy, Aggarwal said. “Our ambition is to build a global business in electric mobility out of India.” According to Deloitte India CEO N Venkatram, the country has shown that we can build businesses of international stature and scale, whether delivering groceries or building electric vehicles. “These enterprises of scale are critical because they create an associated ecosystem of smaller businesses and jobs,” said Venkatram. In her address to India Inc, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman pointed out that the three Aatmanirbhar packages announced in the wake of the Covid lockdown amounted to a stimulus equivalent to 30% of the country’s GDP. “We are infusing greater capital expenditure in infrastructure, this will create assets, wealth and have a multiplier effect. There are also a few lesser-known points in the Budget which will have a great impact on agriculture, industry, and SMEs,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-inc-backs-aatmanirbhar-pitch-vax-diplomacy-puts-focus-on-job-creation/articleshow/81621226.cms||---

Police swung into action in the case only after leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav raked up the issue in the assembly a few days back. Bochaha police station SHO Rajesh Ranjan on Sunday said raids were being conducted to nab all the ten persons. Ranjan said police moved the court three days back for procuring arrest warrants against them. “However, warrants have yet not been issued. The court observed that it would first peruse the case diary before issuing warrants,” he said. Ranjan said police would move the court again to initiate the process of property attachment if the accused were not arrested or surrendered even after issuance of arrest warrants. He said the four-room school, along with the 20 ‘dhur’ land on which it is built, is owned by Hanslal, a native of Garha village under Ahiyapur police station area. “However, he had given the school to one Amrendra Kumar to run it,” the SHO said, adding that Hanslal is the younger brother of the minister. Amrendra, one Dilip Kumar and his wife Ajmeri Khatoon were arrested from the school premises on November 8. Ranjan said a truck bearing registration number of Haryana, four pick-up vans, a car and a bike with 816 cartons of liquor were seized from the school premises. “There are 15 accused in the case and five of them were arrested,” he said. “The liquor was smuggled from Haryana for delivery in different places by the pick-up vans. Dilip was the main receiver of the consignment. Action was taken on the intelligence input shared by the prohibition wing of state police,” he said. Ranjan said Dilip was also involved in another liquor smuggling case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ministers-brother-9-others-evade-arrest-in-liquor-case/articleshow/81619767.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh to put land acquisition for rail projects on fast track||AMARAVATI: With the Centre expressing serious displeasure about the delay in completion of land acquisition for railway projects, the state government has directed district collectors to put the process on fast track. The state government has asked collectors to make tehsildars accountable in case of any further delay in the acquisition of land identified for the development of railway projects. The state government also made it clear that delay in the completion of land acquisition except where environmental clearances from the Centre are pending, would not be allowed. The Union railway minister Piyush Goyal blamed the state government for the delay in completion of the railway projects initiated in Andhra Pradesh as it had not honoured its commitment of taking the 50 per cent burden of the cost of the railway projects. He said that the state government had given its consent to shoulder 50 per cent of the burden if the projects proposed by it were initiated in 2009. However, it has not come forward to take the share after bifurcation, Goyal recently said in Parliament. He pointed out AP has to clear Rs 2,612 crore towards ongoing projects in the state. However, the state communicated its stand to the Centre that it was not in a position to take on the financial burden of the railway projects due to the financial crisis induced by bifurcation. The state government urged the Centre to take up all proposed projects with its own funds as it has no additional funds to spend on railway projects. The state government had, however, promised to shoulder the burden of land acquisition for the railway projects. Alert with the Centre’s displeasure on the issue, the state government verified the facts and found that land acquisition is pending for a number of railway projects in several districts. “We have identified that 30 acres are needed in Kurichedu mandal, 241 acres in Donakonda mandal and 11.14 acres in Tarlubadu mandal for Guntur-Guntakal railway project. We have also found that the requests of the railway authorities for acquisition of 24.64 acres in Cumbum mandal and 7.5 acres in Giddalur mandal, 24 acres in Racharla mandal are pending,” said Prakasam district collector Pola Bhaskar. He said that another 154 acres of land were notified for acquisition for the Vijayawada-Guntur dedicated freight corridor, adding that he has instructed all tehsildars to complete the land acquisition for railway and NH projects on a war-footing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-to-put-land-acquisition-for-rail-projects-on-fast-track/articleshow/81619765.cms||Samdani MN

Officer on special duty for Covid-19 management in Vadodara Dr Vinod Rao has kept a meeting with principals of all 12 government and private nursing colleges of Vadodara district on Monday to get maximum enrolment under this scheme. “Currently, there is no shortage of manpower. Vadodara has handled Covid-19 with advanced and proactive planning. The nursing sahayaks will also be trained as part of this proactive planning so that we have trained nursing manpower ready whenever required. We should have a pool of people who can join in short notice not only in government but also in private hospitals,” said Rao. The directives for this will be issued invoking the Disaster Management Act. Rao, however, added that it is not necessary that the nursing ‘sahayaks’ will be assigned Covid-19 duties in the hospitals. “As of today, we have 5,000 plus beds against which the occupancy is nearly 2,950,” he said. Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 cases in Vadodara city and district crossed the 26,000 mark on Sunday.

The girl had suffered critical injuries in her private parts and remained admitted at a hospital for over a month, said the DGC, adding that she is still undergoing treatment for the injuries. Police had, meanwhile, got a DNA test of the accused conducted, which proved vital evidence in the case that was concluded in 13 trial dates.Divulging details, the DGC said, “Defending himself, the accused claimed that he was framed owing to a property dispute, but evidence like blood-stained underwear, DNA test report and forensic reports indicated that he was guilty.

---||Dehradun||World Water Day: No rains post-monsoon, officials worried that natural water sources may dry up leading to stressed situation in hills in peak summer||NAINITAL/MUSSOORIE: With summers approaching and no rain spells in sight, the authorities are worried that the availability of drinking water will become a problem in the coming months. In most of the areas in Uttarakhand, especially in the hills, the sources of drinking water is rainwater or streams but with almost no rainfall post-monsoon and negligible snowfall in winters, the water sources are drying up fast.Speaking to TOI, the officials of the Jal Sansthan acknowledged that the water level of these sources is going down. “There were hardly any rain spells last winter season and therefore, spring sources are running out of water. These are the only sources of drinking water in several areas in the hills. Thus, it is worrisome how the water demands will be met in the coming months,” said DK Singh, general manager, Jal Sansthan (Kumaon). Though the officials said that Haldwani will bear most of the brunt, areas in Kumaon hills like Ramgarh and Bhowali will also face difficulties. “Haldwani is the biggest city and its water demands are huge but we are more worried about areas like Ramgarh where many resorts have come up in the recent years and the water demand is shooting up,” Singh added. The officials said that they are now planning to send tankers to the hills, and if needed, water will be supplied to the remote areas as well. “Water will be transported to the areas which are inaccessible for tankers. We are also planning to create awareness among people regarding judicious use of waste so that a crisis situation can be avoided,” he further said. In Mussoorie, too, locals are concerned that the town could face water scarcity during the summers. According to local officials, the springs in the town are running out of water due to the lack of precipitation during the winter season. “As compared to last year, the discharge of water in the springs has declined by 5% to 10% this February. This could potentially lead to a scarcity of water during peak summer season,” said Trepan Rawat, assistant engineer, Jal Sansthan. In a similar vein, Sandeep Sahni, president of Uttarakhand Hotel Association, said, “We do not want to go through what the people of Shimla suffered in 2018. Water scarcity would be detrimental for the tourism sector.” Hugh Gantzer, noted Mussoorie-based author and member of the Supreme Court monitoring committee for environmental issues in Doon Valley and Mussoorie, said, “Depletion of water in the springs is alarming. Wanton deforestation and concretisation around the town have had an adverse impact on the recharge of underground aquifers that are the source of our springs.” He urged the authorities to increase the pace of works under the Mussoorie pumping project. As part of the project, water from the Yamuna river would be extracted to meet the requirements of people of the hill town. Notably, the pumping project — a bhoomi poojan ceremony for which was held in March 2020 — has an outlay of Rs 144 crore. Attempts to contact the executive engineer of Peyjal Nigam for his comments on the matter proved unsuccessful despite several attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/world-water-day-no-rains-post-monsoon-officials-worried-that-natural-water-sources-may-dry-up-leading-to-stressed-situation-in-hills-in-peak-summer/articleshow/81619799.cms||Prashant Jha

Similarly, hundreds of students and youths will take part in the ‘Vidhan Sabha gherao’ on March 23,” the RJD leader said. Alleging that the state government has no concrete blueprint to fulfil its commitment to provide 19 lakh jobs, the RJD spokesperson said recruitment was not being done despite vacancies in different government departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejas-reviews-preparations-for-march-23-stir/articleshow/81620582.cms||Ramashankar
---||Kolkata||453 fined over weekend for violating mask rule in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Hours after instructions from Lalbazar, police stations across the city went about challaning citizens not wearing masks properly. Cops fined 211 people till 8pm on Saturday and another 242 on Sunday. There was a special morning drive that lasted three hours. The rise in numbers is significant given that they stood at 52, 77 and 82 on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday respectively. The 390 challans happen to be the highest to be issued since January 15. TimesViewIt is a poor reflection on our collective sense of responsibility that law enforcers have to slap fines to make citizens do what should now be considered our basic duty. Masks are one of the key protections against the virus that is again on the rampage.The cops said they have formed special teams for some of the worst-affected wards, like 31 and 63, and have decided not to distribute masks to those not wearing them — a practice they followed in the past year. “It has been a year since the Covid outbreak in the city. By now, this should be a habit. You cannot keep bending the rules and getting away with it,” said an ACP at Lalbazar. Cops said the maximum violations were reported from central and added areas of Kolkata. South Kolkata, especially its elderly residents, fared better. The police action notwithstanding, TOI witnessed major mask-rule violations across the city. At Maidan, hundreds of youngsters had gathered and only a small section was seen wearing masks. Also, some of those who had masks on, never pulled them above their chins.Similar scenes were witnessed at Gariahat and New Market, where the Chaitra sale witnessed a fair footfall. “We have initiated social media campaigns, making it mandatory for everyone to wear masksand have distributed masks at several public spots. We will be addressing the public spots again. We are asserting the need for social distancing, wearing masks and regular washing of hands,” said a joint commissioner. “We found that till last month, people at least had the masks near their chins. But in February, we found it nowhere near their faces. We have targeted a few places where there are regular aberrations, including markets, buses, tea stalls and malls, especially for this weekend since this is the crucial pre-election weekend and we are conducting special drives,” said an officer. The numbers for Sunday, a section of officers claimed, was still “moderate” compared to the previous year. On an average, 160 people were arrested everyday for not wearing masks in public places in October while more than 300 were arrested every day for the same reason between August and September. “The number of people not wearing masks in Kolkata has almost tripled at my chamber compared to last year. With the election season here, the least we can do to stop the second wave is wear masks,” said Santiranjan Kundu, a doctor who has been at the forefront of the Covid fight as a nodal officer in Behala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/453-fined-over-weekend-for-violating-mask-rule-in-city/articleshow/81620562.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The fair recorded sales of a whopping Rs 45 lakh amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Altogether 104 stalls were put up at the fair by entrepreneurs from different parts of Bihar and other states like West Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Gujarat and Ghaziabad. BMUS president Usha Jha said they were not expecting such huge turnout of customers due to the pandemic, but the weekend proved a jackpot for the stall owners. “This time, we gave space to some small rural entrepreneurs from Hajipur, Bhagalpur Muzaffarpur and Champaran and all of them made a good business,” she said. Women entrepreneur Swati Guha made the highest sales and she was closely followed by Sushma Sinha, Priti and Saumya. Craft store has bagged the award for best stall while Eco Rhythm got prize for selling eco-friendly products. Chitan Jain got the award for his contributions during the Covid pandemic. Chief general manager (CGM) of National Bank For Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD)-Bihar, Sunil Kumar, who was the chief guest at the concluding function, said women are experts in multitasking. “Their self-reliance will strengthen the state and its economy,” he added. Project director of Women Development Corporation Ajay Shrivastava and MSME director Vishwamohan Jha also encouraged the entrepreneurs. Residents of the city too had a gala time during the fair as they went on a shopping spree. One Jyoti Sharma said she bought some dresses with ‘phulkari’ design. “I also liked the indoor plants. I had a good time with my friends on the last day of the fair,” she added. Anamika Singh, a resident of Boring Canal Road, said, “As the Holi is approaching, I bought some organic ‘gulal’ and trendy ‘pichkaris’. I also bought dresses and home-decor items.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/5-day-holi-mela-records-business-worth-rs-45-lakh/articleshow/81620574.cms||Faryal Rumi

Have you availed of tax benefits?||MUMBAI: For income taxpayers, who are yet to invest in or buy financial products to complete their tax savings, there are still several options available before the financial year ends on March 31. From tax-saving schemes and retirement plans by MFs to public provident fund (PPF), five-year bank FDs to insurance policies, they could invest in or buy one or more of these products to lessen their tax burdens, advisers said. Under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, a taxpayer is allowed to invest in some financial assets, buy financial products or spend money under select heads to claim a tax rebate every year. These also include National Saving Certificate with post offices, National Pension Scheme (NPS) of the government, interest paid on housing loans and expenses incurred for children’s education. Read AlsoUnion Budget 2021: A guide to saving your taxesWhether you are a government employee or privately employed, you can avail income tax benefits under Section 80C.In addition to these, senior citizens have the option to invest in senior citizen saving schemes (SCSS) at banks and post offices. One could also claim tax benefits under mediclaim policies and an additional Rs 50,000 put in NPS under different sections of the Act. However, given the time constraints to complete the formalities to invest in or buy these investment products, not all are now available to taxpayers. According to the government, money in PPF accounts currently earns 7.1% annually and 7.4% in SCSS. On the other hand, investments in MF products and unit-linked policies of insurance companies earn market-driven returns. Fund distributors and investment advisers, however, say that it’s not the right thing to always wait for the last few days to invest in tax-saving options or buy insurance products. In such situations, the chance of making a mistake in haste increases.

According to a Kolkata-based investment adviser, people should be careful about the financial products they invest in and the products they buy. For example, for insurance products that allow one-time premium payment, only 10% of the premium amount could be claimed under 80C. Also, only some select retirement plans by MFs are approved investments under this section.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/10-days-for-fy21-to-end-have-you-availed-of-tax-benefits/articleshow/81621404.cms||---

The police said the accused Chandanapalli Rajeswara Rao, 27, is a soldier. He allegedly posed as a Maoist commander and made a telephone call on March 6 to a local gold trader demanding Rs 5 crore. The police said the accused was inspired by a web series. Vizianagaram police chief B Raja Kumari said the gold merchant lodged a complaint with Parvathipuram police on March 7 stating that an unidentified person had pelted stones at his house and broken the windowpanes. The attack took place on March 5. The trader said he heard someone shouting loudly outside his house. He said the next day he received a telephone call from an unidentified person, who demanded Rs 5 crore as protection money. The caller had introduced himself as a top Maoist commander in charge of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Jharkhand. At the residence of the trader, police found three used bullets. Police came to conclusion that the unidentified person didn’t pelt stones but had opened fire at the windowpanes. Parvathipuram DSP A Subhash said the investigation revealed that Chandanapalli Rajeswara Rao, who joined the Army in 2012, came to his home town on leave on January 24. Rao told the police that he had incurred losses of Rs 22 lakh in land deals. He procured a countrymade weapon in Uttar Pradesh before he came to his home town, the DSP added. The police said when the trader expressed his inability to give Rs 5 crore, Rao demanded Rs 1.5 crore. He told the trader to hand over the money in a forest area between Dangabhadra and Vikrampuram on Sunday.

Accompanied by water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha, the CM first went to Baikunthpur block in Gopalganj and inspected the ongoing anti-erosion and strengthening work on the Bandhauli-Sheetalpur-Faijullapur zamindari embankment. During the inspection, Nitish sought details about the soil erosion from the embankment during rainy season last year. He asked the engineers to do steel sheet piling in the embankments near dense human population. He said the steel sheet piling would not only strengthen the embankments but also protect the nearby villages from the danger of floods. “The steel sheet piling was earlier done in an embankment in Madhubani district and its result was good,” Nitish said. “I have asked the WRD engineers to get a fresh assessment of embankments on Gandak river by a team of experts and complete the strengthening work wherever required, before arrival of the next rainy season,” Nitish told reporters. The CM later went to Karcholiyan village under Panapur block of Saran district and inspected the anti-erosion work on the Saran embankment alongside Gandak river. “The work to strengthen the Saran dam is being executed at faster pace and properly. I have given some suggestions to make the embankment more robust so that people do not have to face difficulties during the rainy season,” Nitish said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-finish-anti-erosion-work-on-embankments-by-may-15/articleshow/81619717.cms||Madan Kumar

The SC, meanwhile, on Friday, raised concerns over resultant inequality in case the 50% limit was to be removed. In Rajasthan, including 5% reservation for most backward classes (MBCs) and 10% for economically weaker sections (EWS), the total reservation is 64%. Reservation for SCs is 16%, 12% for STs and 21% for OBCs. Shailendra Singh, general secretary, Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti, said, “The Supreme Court should review the 50% cap on reservation and the ceiling should be removed. In 14 states of the country, the reservation has crossed the 50% limit. The capping has anyway been removed with 10% reservation to EWS. In 3-4 states, the matter related to reservation got stuck in the Supreme Court and high courts. The current reservation is done on the basis of the caste census done in 1931.” “The population of reserved castes has gone beyond 80%. About 30 years ago, the Mandal Commission Report had stated that OBCs comprised 52% of the country’s population. The population of OBCs (other backward classes) will be around 58-60% in the current situation. However, they are entitled to only 27% reservation,” he added. He also demanded that the Central government should make the findings of the caste-based census, which was conducted in 2011, public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gujjars-want-sc-to-review-50-limit-on-reservation/articleshow/81621389.cms||---
---||Business||Companies look for support as Sebi sops set to end||MUMBAI: Fiscal 2021 will end soon and with that the Covid-related exemptions, given by markets regulator Sebi, including relief to promoters on open offer and easing of IPO rules that helped in fund-raise amid lockdown-triggered liquidity crunch. Analysts believe the exemptions have served their purpose and have to end with the resumption of normalcy in the country. But there are others who feel that the liquidity crunch and financial impact will continue to haunt companies in the next financial year, making a case for the continuation of some relief. Sebi has not made any announcements regarding the extension of the exemptions. The exemptions include relaxation of the obligation on a promoter who owns more than 25% in a listed company to make an open offer if s/he increases stake to 10% through creeping acquisition. Also, there is no restriction on an acquirer who holds more than 25% in a listed company from making an open offer if s/he has acquired the company’s shares in the preceding 52 weeks. Sebi has also extended the validity of regulatory approval for launching IPOs and rights issues till March 31. These exemptions, along with other factors like attractive valuations, resulted in robust fund-raising by companies through rights offers, IPOs and preferential issuances despite the lockdown. “The relaxations were made with two key perspectives in mind. First, to facilitate fund-raising during the pandemic since it was expected that most businesses would need emergency cash to tide over the crisis. Second, to ease difficulties in compliance requirements that necessitated periodic filings or sending of physical documents to shareholders or regulators,” said J Sagar Associates partner Vikram Raghani. Reliance Industries, Mahindra Finance and Aditya Birla Fashion, among others, launched their rights offers, while Gland Pharma, Happiest Minds, Burger King, etc, debuted in the stock market with their IPOs during the pandemic. The exemptions also facilitated the Tata Sons plan to increase stake in Tata Power by 10% through a preferential issue without making an open offer. Law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas partner Mukul Sharma said that certain exemptions like flexibility in pricing of preferential issue and shortening of restriction period for fund-raising after buyback were relevant in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, and not so much almost a year later. However, he thinks that since the financial impact of the lockdown is likely to continue to affect companies even in fiscal 2022, exemptions such as those on creeping acquisition limit, eligibility criteria for fast-track rights’ issue and minimum subscription for rights issue should be continued. “That will allow companies the flexibility to raise more funds.” Raghani, on the other hand, feels that since businesses and markets have more or less stabilised, relaxations are not likely to be extended. The corporate affairs ministry has permitted companies to hold board meetings and conduct annual shareholder meetings or AGMs through video-conferencing until June and December respectively. “Given the imminent threat of virus mutations and subsequent waves of infections, virtual shareholder meetings will continue to be normal,” said Sharma. Dhir and Dhir Associates associate partner Ashish Pyasi said the relaxations were intended for the lockdown period, but the number of Covid cases is on the rise and normalcy still far away. “Lifting the relaxations will add to companies’ stress.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cos-look-for-support-as-sebi-sops-set-to-end/articleshow/81621357.cms||Reeba Zachariah

In fact, 10 out of 33 districts or 30% of the state districts at least doubled the cases. Only two districts – Anand (-9.8%) and Gir Somnath (-17.9%) – recorded negative trends, whereas 31 recorded rise in the cases. Gujarat in 24 hours added 1,580 new cases and reported deaths of seven patients. Out of four major districts, Surat saw an increase in cases by 116% (1,270 to 2,746) whereas Ahmedabad by 112% (1,052 to 2,232). Rajkot and Vadodara reported a rise of 72% and 22% respectively. Among the districts reporting at least 20 new cases, Surendranagar (from 6 to 29) and Narmada (from 21 to 87) tripled the cases. In fact, Ahmedabad and Surat accounted for 57% of the cases between March 15 and 21. The two districts’ tally increased from 48% between March 8 and 14. The two districts accounted for 19 out of 26 deaths in the past seven days, recording 7 out of every 10 deaths. The ratio decreased slightly as the two districts had reported seven out of nine, or 78% of the deaths in the past week. “Cities have remained epicenters of the pandemic due to factors such as higher population density and higher movement of citizens. But the spread of the pandemic in the smaller districts is surely worrisome. On Saturday, 61% of the total testing for Covid-19 took place in four major districts. If the testing is increased in other districts, the cases could show a northwards trend,” said a city-based epidemiologist. Compared to 82% rise in cases, the vaccination reported slightly higher rise at 89% in a week’s time in Gujarat. Between March 8 and 14, 5.68 lakh citizens were inoculated for the first dose. The vaccination increased to 10.71 lakh, averaging 1.53 lakh shots daily. Experts advocated inoculation of the persons – identified as ‘super spreaders’ – at the earliest instead of repeated testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/10-guj-districts-saw-covid-cases-double-within-a-week/articleshow/81626412.cms||Parth Shastri

The ratio decreased slightly as the two districts had reported seven out of nine, or 78% of the deaths in the past week. “Cities have remained epicenters of the pandemic due to factors such as higher population density and higher movement of citizens. But the spread of the pandemic in the smaller districts is surely worrisome. On Saturday, 61% of the total testing for Covid-19 took place in four major districts. If the testing is increased in other districts, the cases could show a northwards trend,” said a city-based epidemiologist. Compared to 82% rise in cases, the vaccination reported slightly higher rise at 89% in a week’s time in Gujarat. Between March 8 and 14, 5.68 lakh citizens were inoculated for the first dose. The vaccination increased to 10.71 lakh, averaging 1.53 lakh shots daily. Experts advocated inoculation of the persons – identified as ‘super spreaders’ – at the earliest instead of repeated testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/10-guj-districts-saw-covid-cases-double-within-a-week/articleshow/81626411.cms||Parth Shastri

Khurshid, while talking to the mediapersons on the sidelines of a felicitation programme of newly elected municipal counsellors organised by former health minister A A Khan at his residence, said, “The elections on four RS seats will be held in 2022 and I feel that party should field one local Muslim candidate which will give the community a sense of belonging with the party.” Four RS members—Om Prakash Mathur, Ram Kumar Verma, Harshvardhan Singh and Alphons Kannanthanam out of 10 from Rajasthan will retire in July 2022. Khurshid seemed disappointed to say that Muslim MLA Rafeek Khan (Adarsh Nagar, Jaipur) had raised the issue of the objectionable content related to Islam in the Class XII Political Science textbook. “I would be happy had any non-Muslim MLA raised the issue in the assembly,” said the former minister. He cautioned the community to raise issues which doesn’t help BJP to polarise the society and added that be careful and watchful while raising issues but not fearful. Replying to a question of rising resentment among Muslims for the Congress in the state, Khurshid said that defeating Congress would not serve the purpose. “Muslims have to think seriously are these issues more important than the larger frame. I am not saying give up your rights but strategise your rights for the larger good.” He was also averse to the view of consolidation of the Muslim community by holding programmes only for the community. “I believe that Muslims should not consolidate, but they should connect with each and every aspect of the society,” said Khurshid. He assured community leaders gathered at the event of timely addressing their concerns with chief minister Ashok Gehlot. Replying to the question on the declining Muslim representation, he said that Muslim shouldn’t worry about the downfall of their elected representatives. “It is not necessary that only Muslims can raise their own issues. We are fortunate that non-Muslims have always been raising our concerns and fighting for our cause.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-should-field-one-muslim-candidate-for-22-rs-polls-khurshid/articleshow/81621387.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Thus it was decided to appoint guest faculty on contract basis based on the guidelines of the state government roster,” he said. Besides, the syndicate members also approved the proposal to give promotions to teachers under the Career Advancement Scheme (CAS), Merit Promotion Scheme (MPS) and time-bound scheme to those teachers who have not been promoted so far due to one reason or another, he said adding this decision would give a boost to morale of teachers who were waiting for long to get their due promotion in their career. According to Manglam, the syndicate members also approved the proposal to hold PhD test to give an impetus to research work. The university has already invited applications online and the test is scheduled to be held on April 11 at different centres in Patna . “In another major decision, the syndicate agreed to award maximum seven marks as grace to students of regular courses at undergraduate (UG) and post graduate (PG) level courses for which the university had recently held the examinations,” the media in charge said.

PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur said the demonstration was due to some confusion among the nursing staff. He said the health department has cancelled all leave of doctors and staff, including nurses, till April 5 as a precautionary measure in view of the increase in Covid cases in some parts of the country. “All OPD services and operation theatres remain closed on Sunday and the nurses attached to them also remain off duty. The emergency runs round the clock every day,” said Dr Thakur. The demonstrating nursing staff, however, demanded leave during the Holi.

On March 19, Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha had provided the copies of the Bill to the MLAs.

On Sunday, CPI(ML) state secretary Kunal, party’s politburo member Dhirendra Jha and another senior functionary K D Yadav said the protests would be organised at the block levels on Tuesday. “The entire opposition will protest against the passage of the anti-democratic Bill in the state assembly on Tuesday,” Kunal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/police-bill-ml-to-hold-protests-today/articleshow/81620777.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Online concerts still in vogue despite offline shows’ return||Kolkata: With the lockdown effectively vaporizing the in-person concert business for a year, artistes had turned to live-streaming and online performances. Now, even though offline concerts are back, digital shows are still in vogue. According to Pt Bickram Ghosh, online concerts are here to stay. “Currently, people are going for offline shows. But once live shows become normal again, a certain section will want to go back to digital because of the sheer cost effectiveness and accessibility. Besides, online shows have a good reach,” said Ghosh, who has done 15 online shows already and has curated 15 online concerts for ‘Play Good Music’ that are yet to be telecast. “We are getting to collaborate with musicians across countries. Even if online shows have not cracked the monetary module as well as they wanted to, I believe it will be done in future as well,” he said. Tabla virtuoso Subhajyoti Guha, who accompanied Vidushi Anupama Bhagwat at this year’s Dover Lane Music Conference, has done seven paid online concerts during the pandemic. “The online concerts brought in an audience who would perhaps never have turned up for a live show. On Wednesday, I had a tabla solo show at Gyan Manch. While this could only reach audiences in Kolkata, if beamed digitally, the show would have reached those in other countries too,” he said. On March 11, Guha recorded an online concert with sitarist Ustad Shahid Parvez Khan that will be beamed later. “Alongside live shows, I look forward to good digital shows with good sound quality that are ticketed and marketed well,” he added. Organizers, too, want to continue with digital concerts. Sarod player Indrayuddh Majumder, who organized 36 online concerts for Swara Samrat Festival 2021, said, “During the pandemic, digital was the only alternative. For the next season, we plan to run online and offline versions in parallel.” The digital platform is also giving exposure to young talents and a few have begun earning from such shows. Going forward, artistes are looking at offering fans new online experiences that are absent in traditional concerts. While reinventing the presentation style of digital concerts, they are thinking of introducing unmediated intimacy between fans and artistes that accompanies live-streaming, recording acts in interesting locations and using technology to perform together in real time across time zones. In Kolkata, vocalist Soham Roychowdhury, who formed a group called U-Resonance and hosted a digital concert titled ‘Origins: The First Move’ for three acoustic pop acts on February 28, is planning to host a hybrid show in July. According to him, digital concerts offer a greater scope for a variety of artistes and introduce audiences to genres they might otherwise have not heard. “For our first show, we innovated and had live chats and comment box options for premium viewers. They even got edited copies of the show. Our next show will be on Indian fusion. Apart from live chats and comment boxes, we plan to introduce an interactive session between artistes and fans,” Roychowdhury said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/online-concerts-still-in-vogue-despite-offline-shows-return/articleshow/81620576.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The move is aimed at involving the locals in wildlife conservation programme and protecting the forest from the timber mafia. The committees have been registered under the Societies Registration Act and will work in coordination with PTR, which is facing an acute staff crunch. Naveen Khandelwal, deputy director of PTR, said each committee would comprise six elected villagers and a forest inspector of PTR as secretary. “The need for the EDCs was felt after the forestry project of JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) expired in 2017. We have a plan to constitute 90 EDCs in villages declared by PTR as ‘sensitive’ and ‘highly sensitive’ from the viewpoint of man-tiger conflict,”said Khandelwal. Naresh Kumar, WWF’s senior project officer, said that the forest department and the WWF would provide the necessary revolving funds to the EDCs to carry out employment and sustenance-based programmes to ensure the linkage of communities living in eco-sensitive zone of PTR to income generation sources. The EDCs would be linked directly with over 10 government departments like health, education, development, public distribution, woman and child care, horticulture, sericulture and Khadi and village industries board to extend direct benefits of the government-sponsored welfare schemes to village people.After setting a concrete platform of development and income generation, the EDCs would expand their activities up to the doorstep at their respective villages as a link between the government departments and the village people for their welfare, Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/6-eco-development-committees-to-assist-wildlife-conservation-programme-in-ptr/articleshow/81619264.cms||Keshav Agarwal

It effectively takes away powers from those who were voted by the people and gives it to those defeated. BJP has cheated the people,” Kejriwal said. The Bill seeks to give more power to the lieutenant governor over the elected government and make it necessary for the latter to take the opinion of the LG before taking any executive action under any law. The elected government believes that it is designed to cripple it and give undue powers in the hands of the lieutenant governor, who represents the Centre. On Saturday, Kejriwal addressed a protest rally at Jantar Mantar and appealed to the central government to withdraw the proposed amendment to the GNCTD Bill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-bjp-has-cheated-the-people-of-delhi/articleshow/81640218.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The CM, while inaugurating and laying the foundation stone of these projects during a state-level programme held through videoconferencing from Chandigarh, said these projects would ensure equitable development in all 90 assembly constituencies of the state. State cabinet ministers, Union ministers, MPs, MLAs, public representatives and administrative officers attended the programme. “Since we have come to power, our strategy for implementation and development has been guided by principles of Antyodaya — of serving and uplifting the last person first. Unlike previous governments, who walked on the motto of regional and district-wise development, we have ensured equitable development of all 90 assembly constituencies,” said Khattar in his inaugural address. The CM said unlike previous government’s tenure, where needy persons had to run from pillar to post for getting their privileges, his government was committed to ensure the benefit of every welfare scheme was provided at the doorsteps of every needy person. The CM said parivar pehchan patras were to make every person self-reliant by providing them first-class facilities in health, education, employment along with ensuring security. Khattar said out of 60 lakh families registered under this scheme, a survey will be conducted and 1 lakh families having the lowest income will be identified in the first phase. A plan will be prepared to make them self-employed in any field of their choice. “Lists of employment opportunities have been prepared by all departments, so that the beneficiaries under this scheme can opt for business opportunities as per their wish,” said the CM. The CM added development projects were always approved while keeping in view demands of elected representatives or the people. Apart from this, development projects are planned without any demand, like opening a college within a radius of every 15 kilometres was a significant decision which was taken without any requirement. “Mapping of all these colleges was done. Later in 2019, for the first time, foundation stones of 22 government colleges were laid from Chandigarh,”he said. In this year’s budget, the state government has decided to upgrade 100-bedded district civil hospitals to 200 beds, he added. “Economic use of water is the government’s topmost priority and realising the same in next two years will be dedicated as “WATER BIENNIAL 2021-23” of the irrigation and water resources department has been announced in the budget, asserted Khattar .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/khattar-throws-open-163-projects-via-videoconference/articleshow/81621394.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Women to be deployed as Gypsy drivers at Corbett||DEHRADUN: In order to boost participation of women in wildlife tourism activities in Uttarakhand, the state forest department has decided to deploy women in previously all-male jobs like Gypsy drivers and nature guides at Corbett Tiger Reserve. While marking the International Day of Forests at an event at Ramnagar on Sunday, state forest minister Harak Singh Rawat in the presence of chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat said that 50 women nature guides and 50 female Gypsy drivers will be deployed directly by the forest department after training them. He claimed that this is for the first time in the country that women Gypsy drivers are being appointed in a national park. He said that “the villagers have become the top choice of the forest department for these works as they carry experience and traditional value in protecting the forests and curbing human-wildlife conflicts.” This year’s theme for the International Day of Forests is “Restoration of Forests”. Speaking on the ocassion, CM Rawat said, “Our focus is on generating livelihood for women as they play a vital role in the economy of hills and the ecology and are closest to the forests. These women are not just saviours but also conservators of forests and wildlife. We aim to train at least 10,000 youth, out of which 5,000 will be females, who will work as ‘van prahari’ and will engage in different activities in the protected areas.” He added that an ampitheatre is being set up at Aamdanda in CTR where sound and light shows will be held as well as a ‘world-class wildlife rescue centre’ will soon be opened in Dhela range of CTR where visitors will be able to see tigers. Currently, there are around 105 nature guides in Corbett and all of them are men. This move to induct women, officials said, will address gender discrepancy. Head of forest force Rajiv Bhartari told TOI, “Rejuvenation of rivers, removal of lantana, afforestation, conservation of water and soil, protection from wildfires are the various initiatives being taken up by us. These activities are directly related to restoration of forests. This move will help people get closer to forests and conserve them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/now-women-to-be-deployed-as-gypsy-drivers-guides-at-corbett/articleshow/81619815.cms||Shivani Azad

They were all residents of Mahua Dandi village and were heading towards Thingri village in Jalalabad to meet their relative, Abhishek. The accident was reported near the link road when the victims turned their bike towards the village. After the accident, the truck driver fled from the spot with the vehicle and all the three bikers reportedly bled to death. The bodies have been sent for autopsy by Allahaganj SHO Ajab Singh and traffic was cleared after an hour. “We have registered an FIR against the unidentified vehicle under IPC sections 304a (causing death by negligence) and 279 (rash driving). We have shared the information of the accident with nearby police stations and are collecting more information about the truck that killed the bikers,” the SHO told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/three-bikers-killed-after-speeding-truck-crushes-two-wheeler-in-shahjahanpur/articleshow/81619268.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Kolkata||New blood makes Kolkata’s vintage vehicle lovers roar with enthusiasm||During British rule, Calcutta was the hub of the most expensive and best automobiles from around the world. After the Britishers left, several babus and CEOs of top companies started owning these cars. However, a sudden crisis of spare parts forced owners to sell off these exquisite vehicles, giving rise to smuggling. Till 1980, hundreds of these cars were smuggled out of the country and soon, the entire vintage car business was being controlled by a small group, who’d mislead car owners or withhold information from them to make a quick buck. Things started changing in 2017 when three young men – Souvik Ghose Chaudhuri, Prithvi Nath Tagore, and Rupak Ghosh – decided to end their monopoly. Powered by the internet and social media, they started communicating with vintage car enthusiasts around the world and made all the relevant information available to the people of Kolkata. “With that, common people and car owners became aware that they could restore and run their cars in Kolkata. And that changed everything,” said Souvik. The trio’s endeavour encouraged many city youngsters to develop the hobby of collecting and restoring vintage vehicles. CT spoke to four such young vintage vehicle enthusiasts who share what made them pursue this hobby and the challenges involved.  ‘This is the car Harry Potter drove in’Prized possession:Ford Anglia 105E (1964) bought in March 2021. Why this hobby: Armaan’s father Amritendu Roy has been collecting vintage motorcycles and scooters for the last five years. Every Sunday, Armaan would accompany Amritendu for a ride, which made the young school student fall in love with vintage vehicles. “But unlike my father, I am more fascinated by old cars,” said Armaan. This month he finally managed to persuade his father to buy him the car of his dreams – a Ford Anglia. “This is the same model in which Harry Potter and Ron Weasley fly back to the Hogwarts Castle in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. That was blue and mine is white,” said the 12-year-old enthusiast. Challenges: The car was in pretty good condition and didn’t need much repairing. Armaan, who knows the names of almost all the spare parts used in the car, said, “There were some issues in the exhaust pipe, but that has been taken care of.” Armaan’s biggest regret right now is not being old enough to be able to drive the car. So, he is using this time to gather all the theoretical knowledge about driving and restoring old vehicles. “As soon as I reach the legal age, I will apply for my driving licence,” he added. ‘These cars evoke my childhood memories’Prized possessions: Baby Hindustan (1957) and Ambassador (1958) bought in 2020 and 2021 respectively. Why this hobby: This Jadavpur-based MBA student’s father brought home a second-hand Mark 4 Ambassador (1987) when Souradip was a young kid. From school to tuition, the car became a part of his daily commute. “I soon developed a special bond with this beauty. After a few years, when my family started thinking about selling off the car, I vetoed it,” said Souradip. Sometime later, the car broke down and remained out of operation for a long period. But Souradip’s love for it prompted the young enthusiast to study about the brand and before he knew it, he started the process of restoring the car. Following that, he pursued his hobby further by buying two more Ambassadors. Challenges: Since the company has closed down, procuring spare parts is the biggest challenge for owners looking to restore vintage Ambassadors. “Restoring a vehicle means bringing it as close to its original form as possible. For that I often reach out to the old spare parts shops in Mullick Bazar and rely on the internet,” said Souradip. But there are several parts he has to make as well. ‘There is no better way to stay in touch with history’Prized possessions: MG Magnette ZA (1955), Fiat Select 1100 (1961) bought in 2018 and 2020 respectively. Why this hobby: Ever since Darshan saw three vintage cars belonging to his landlord being restored from scrap in his teenage years, he secretly started desiring to become a proud owner of a few vintage beauties when he grew up as he thought “there is no better way to stay in touch with history”. The opportunity finally came knocking in 2018, when he saw an MG Magnette ZA at the petrol pump owned by him. “After almost one and a half years of pursuing, the owner finally agreed to sell this rare automobile to me,” said Darshan, a businessman, who shares his love for vintage vehicles with sons Vivan and Vedant. “We take online classes on vintage and classic cars every week,” said Vivan, who, along with his brother, convinced his dad to buy them a Fiat Select 1100 last year. Challenges: While the Magnette came to Darshan in perfect running condition, the Fiat had some issues and is currently being restored. “The body of the car was damaged and we had to work on it from scratch,” said Vivan. So, the colour has been scraped and different parts of the body are being either made or replaced. ‘my passion for two-wheelers continues with this’Prized possession:Lambretta Model D 125 (1952) bought in 2021 Why this hobby: Barno and his elder brother’s fascination for two-wheelers began in their early childhood. The duo’s passion-fuelled in 2009 when their dad brought home a second motorcycle – 1986 INSuzuki – which became their preferred vehicle whenever they sneaked out. With time, Barno’s love for vintage two-wheelers grew even stronger and from the age of 18, he started participating in rallies. In the meantime, he kept on collecting motorcycles, but none of them was vintage or classic. It was only recently that the hotel management student could buy his first vintage scooter – Lambretta Model D 125 (1952) – from a scrapyard in Howrah. “With this scooter, I am taking my passion for two-wheelers to a different direction,” said Barno. Challenges: Besides the engine and wheels, the royal Lambretta had nothing else. “When I came to know that somebody just threw it off, I could not stop myself from buying it,” said Barno, who started restoring the scooter in January and has managed to complete 50% of the job till now. Being manufactured in Italy, a major chunk of the missing spare parts needs to be imported, while others are being custom-made in Kolkata. “I want it to look just the way it used to back in the day. And to do that, I need some more time and research,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-blood-makes-kolkatas-vintage-vehicle-lovers-roar-with-enthusiasm/articleshow/81618419.cms||Bishwabijoy Mitra

---||Goa||Soon, state forensic science lab to conduct tests for synthetic drugs||PANAJI: The Goa State Forensic Science Laboratory (GSFSL) has placed an order for narcotic and psychotropic standard reference samples from Germany, a move that will pave the way for the state to conduct its own tests for synthetic drugs. The officer said that testing for synthetic drugs will help police speed up the investigation process and to file chargesheets. Presently, drugs cases in the state are pending because it takes a year to receive the report from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), Hyderabad. “We have placed the order and it will take three months to arrive,” a senior police officer said. Once the samples are received, testing for narcotic substances, like LSD, MDMA, cocaine and heroin among others, can commence, the officer said. After failing to get bidders on three occasions, GSFSL had approached the state government for permission to directly place an order for procuring the narcotic and psychotropic standard reference samples. Ganja and charas are tested at the food and drugs administration (FDA) laboratory in Goa, while most chemical drugs are sent to CFSL for testing. Synthetic drugs are imported by foreigners, and are mostly used during parties. “Such drugs are sold in Goa during the peak tourist season when foreigners are in the state,” the officer said. He also said that after analysing data, the anti-narcotics cell found that 30 foreigners who were arrested in drug-related cases had entered the state via Dabolim airport. In 2018, CFSL’s Delhi and Hyderabad units stopped accepting drug samples due to unavailability of reference material for identification of the seized narcotics. Thus, many cases pertaining to chemical drugs like LSD, MDMA hit a roadblock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/soon-state-forensic-science-lab-to-conduct-tests-for-synthetic-drugs/articleshow/81621405.cms||Murari Shetye

---||Jaipur||Uproar over old buildings being razed for Chambal river front||JAIPUR: Developing river front on the sides of Chambal river ghats has now courted controversy. According to activists, roads are being widened in the Walled City of Kota after razing old buildings of historical importance. State government is in the process of making Kota city a tourist attraction where a ‘Chambal River Front View’ will be developed. Government has claimed that this project worth hundreds of crores will beautify the city and will attract more tourists. This is, however, allegedly being done at the cost of razing down city’s history. Recently, a building was razed by the Kota-Urban Improvement Trust (UIT) and now a 125-year-old haveli is said to be next on target. Known as Laal Haveli, it was built by a cloth merchant in the Walled City of Kota where the jharokhas have architectural importance. However, now the owner has got a stay order from the Rajasthan High Court against its demolition. Owner of the Laal Haveli, Arvind Kumar Jain said, “We were asked to give consent to make way for roads till Chambal Ghats by razing our ancestral haveli. We went to meet the officials and gave a dissent note in writing as this is a family heritage. Government is putting red stones on every house at the entry gate of Kota for its beautification but this 125-year-old Laal Haveli is on their target. This destruction should be stopped.” TOI contacted UIT Kota secretary Rajesh Joshi who denied demolishing any historical or century old building. “Buildings in already dilapidated condition are being destroyed. We have taken permission from the owners before taking any action. Nothing is being done without the permission of the owners and all the rules are being followed,” said Joshi. Reacting to the claim of permission being given by the owners, Madan Meena, director of Kota Heritage Society, who has been continuously opposing the move said, “Buildings more than 100 years old are being destroyed by the government in the name of development. If tomorrow, the royal family of Jaipur says that they will raze down City Palace to construct a complex in its place will the government let the history of the city be destroyed? Isn’t it the responsibility of the government to conserve such buildings that are century old for our future generation?” Government is in the process of developing many flyovers, gardens, parks and a six-km Heritage Walkway at the Chambal ghats. There are said to be ‘samadhis’ of Naga sadhus at the ghats along with some idols which activists said will be in danger of getting destroyed given the development work being undertaken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/uproar-over-old-bldgs-being-razed-for-chambal-river-front/articleshow/81621398.cms||---

---||Chennai||Inside the raw, real world of Imayam||By AarvalanWhen the Tamil literary world was celebrating the recent Sahitya Akademi win for ‘Sellatha Panam’, it’s author, Imayam, felt the award was long overdue, and his whole body of work deserved to be honoured. The conviction of the 57-year-old author stems from the belief in his stories about the people of the soil and their universal appeal. Imayam has always been interested in the everyday lives of "ordinary" men and women, who harbour within them extraordinary qualities in the face of inequality and oppression. But what he does best, is ask questions. In ‘Sellatha Panam’, a poignant story of woman who sets herself on fire unable to bear the heartbreak of seeing the husband she loves turning out to be an abusive partner, the writer through the character questions why love is not pragmatic, why isn’t it enough? Why do women have to bear the burden of a failed relationship?Imayam’s short stories and novels hold a mirror to humanity, explaining how caste subtly serves as a divider and unifier. It examines the concealed multi-layers involved in caste politics, right from the grassroots to the equations that rule the higher echelons of the power structure. His women are strikingly independent, exhibit the fighting spirit and don’t try to live in an enchanted artificial world. Neither do they meekly surrender to the prevailing ecosystem. "I am not a storyteller at all. The stories I have told have all been written by the society I live in," says Imayam.Writing about people living on the edge, the theme of oppression is recurrent in his works, beginning with his first novel ‘Koveru Kazhuthaigal’ (1994). Translated to ‘Burden of Beasts’ in English, it dealt with the Puthirai Vannan, a sub-sect among washermen, who were considered untouchable. It went on to garner praise from renowned writer Sundara Ramasamy who said "there is no novel to equal the status of ‘Koveru Kazhuthaigal’ in the past 100 years." M A Susila, retired professor of Tamil department at Fatima College, Madurai, who taught the novel as part of the syllabus for a good four years, says what makes Imayam stand apart is his portrayal of realism without being overtly didactic. "The way he adopts simple language without dishing out political viewpoints in an unduly loud tone and language makes it unique," says Susila. She does not agree with the contention that Imayam’s works are low on refined aesthetics, a charge levelled against him. On the contrary, his use of local flavour in the language, makes his characters relatable. In the eponymous ‘Pradhu Manu’ (placing a petition before God), the ignorant and innocent Thangamani undergoes many travails at the temple. She has lost a piece of jewellery at home and is seeking God’s assistance. The official "petition-writer" insists on a payment to set-up a hearing by God. Through the experience, Thangamani realises it’s not just devotion that matters, gods have categories and powers and to get the required results, you need to pay a price. Despite many attempts by critics and readers, Imayam refuses to be labelled a dalit writer or a feminist writer, iconoclast or avant-garde or wrestle with any ideological constraints. The author says, "Raw life, homegrown scenarios, ought to determine the writer’s policy. Can policy therefore direct one’s writing? How can I restrict myself to telling the story of dalits alone, whereas the dalit is part of whole milieu? This kind of branding only demeans a writer." Though he does not deny that he is rooted in the Dravidian tradition, Imayam cautions and lays stress on the distinction between the philosophical as against the political. He belongs to the former, he says, following men who took the movement forward along with Periyar. Imayam began writing during the 1980s and 1990s, when short stories were written mainly about the urban middle class that highlighted the external factors, instead of emotions. Imayam in a single stroke brought naturalism, a keen eye that read into society. His was not only a social commentary but transcended the sociological or aesthetic impressions. Questions came up and readers had to seek for and speak the answers. One can say that So Dharman and Imayam were the byproducts of the dalit politics and study of dalit tradition that was happening in the 1990s. But Imayam stands out for his broad spectrum. ‘Esanarul’, a short story involves the crossing of limits and the life of an ‘odhuvar’ (singer of Shaivite hymns) is touched upon here.Late S Ramakrishnan of Cre-A publishing house had taken upon himself the task of coming out with all of Imayam’s works. Editor of ‘Dhalam’ magazine Baaravi, says Ramakrishna’s role in the success of Imayam is stupendous. "If Imayam was the raw diamond, Ramakrishnan as the editor, polished it to give it all the shine and glow."Karunaprasad of Bodhi Vanam, a Chennai-based publishing house, says few have Imayam’s mastery to tackle complex issues. ‘Pethavan’ for instance, showed honour killing was perceived by a section as an atonement for the sins of inter-caste marriage. Imayam’s twist gave a surprise end to the story where the father of the girl would commits suicide and brings forth the stark reality of suppression that are at play and the caste issues with all its ramifications. He does it without in any way camouflaging the situation with his words. Imayam’s simplicity is his power.(The writer is a literary enthusiast)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/inside-the-raw-real-world-of-imayam/articleshow/81620597.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Election panel clears decks for implementation of PRC||HYDERABAD: The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Sunday cleared the decks for the implementation of the Pay Revision Commission (PRC) for government employees. Though PRC chairman CR Biswal had submitted the report to the government in December itself, its implementation was delayed firstly because of employees opposing meagre 7.5 per cent fitment suggested by the PRC and later due to model code of conduct for two graduates MLC election coming into force. The finance department officials wrote to the ECI seeking permission to implement the PRC. In a reply to the state government’s submission, the ECI had made it clear that it has no objection to implementation of PRC by the state government, but warned that the permission should not be used to derive political mileage in the bypoll to Nagarjuna Sagar constituency. “The model code of conduct, which was in force due to the MLC polls, has come to an end with the announcement of results to the two seats on Saturday. However, the model code of conduct for Nagarjuna Sagar constituency is still in force but it will be only confined to Nalgonda district,” said chief electoral officer Shashank Goel. As a result, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is likely to announce the government’s decision on the percentage of fitment to be given to the government employees in a day or two. Sources said the CM is also likely to announce the government’s decision on whether to continue or discontinue offline classes in view of the rising cases of Covid-19. He may also give clarity on how to promote the students in the coming academic year. The model code of conduct for the Nagarjuna Sagar by-election will be in force only in Nalgonda district and will not be applicable to the entire state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/election-panel-clears-decks-for-implementation-of-prc/articleshow/81621408.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Delhi||Common cold virus saved lives in India||NEW DELHI: One of the biggest mysteries of the Covid-19 infection in India relative to other countries like the US and UK has been the lower mortality recorded in India. An explanation has been posited in a study carried out by scientists of National Institute of Immunology and AIIMS and published in Frontiers in Immunology, a top-rated medical journal. The researchers found that 66% of blood and plasma samples collected in pre-Covid times from the individuals with no history of exposure to the coronavirus had high frequency of CD4+T cells that responded robustly to the non-spike domain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.

Coronavirus live updatesT Cells are a subset of white blood cells that plays an important role in the body’s immune system. CD4 T-cells are considered ‘helper’ cells because they do not neutralise infections but trigger the body's response to infections. “The presence of T cells that are responsive to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and non-spike protein in persons who have never been exposed to Covid could be because of exposure to other coronaviruses that cause the common cold,” explained Dr Ashok Sharma, associate professor, department of biochemistry, AIIMS. Read AlsoUS health agency questions robustness of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine trial dataAstraZeneca Plc may have provided an incomplete view of efficacy data on its Covid-19 vaccine from a large scale US trial, a US health agency said Tuesday in a fresh setback for the shot.According to Dr Nimesh Gupta, lead author of the study and head of the vaccine immunology division at NII, the cross-reactive T cells from coronaviruses that cause common cold may not protect from Covid infection, but by responding to the SARS-CoV-2 protein, they may limit the severity of the disease. The authors concluded in the study that the cross-reactive CD4+ T cells might not be implicated in solely terminating the viral infection, but they might limit the virus burden and reduce the course of symptomatic infection leading to lower incidence of severe disease. Dr N K Mehra, emeritus scientist and former dean of AIIMS, said that the mortality rate of Covid in India is less than 1.5% when in countries such as the US, it is above 3%. “In Mexico, the Covid mortality rate is above 10%,” he added. Mehra said previous exposure to coronaviruses that cause the common cold was certainly one of the reasons behind the lower mortality rate in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/common-cold-virus-saved-lives-in-india/articleshow/81640239.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Dehradun||Have stringent measures to control Covid spread during Kumbh: Centre to Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan has written a strongly-worded letter to Uttarakhand chief secretary Om Prakash, highlighting concerns raised by a high-level team that visited Haridwar recently on the need for stringent measures to control spread of Covid. In the letter, Bhushan said that at least 10-20 pilgrims and a similar number of locals are testing positive for Covid daily in Haridwar and such a positivity rate has "potential to rapidly cause an uptick in cases” given the high turnout expected at the mega event. He added that daily testing of 50,000 antigen and 5,000 RT-PCR tests as claimed by the state government is not enough in Haridwar given the expected turnout for Kumbh. Incidentally, while the Centre's team has been told that 55,000 Covid tests are happening in Haridwar daily, sources told TOI that the maximum tests done by the health department in Haridwar in the month of March were on March 11 —on the day of the shahi snan of Maha Shivaratri - attended by over 32 lakh - when 38,911 samples were collected. This is the highest single-day sample collection in the district so far in March whereas on other days, average sample collection ranged between 3,000 to 5,000 samples. The concerns raised by the Centre come even as chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat has announced that Kumbh will be ‘open for all’ and ‘no one will be unnecessarily stopped’ since the intention was to make it ‘a grand event.’ Notably, the Uttarakhand high court had also expressed concern regarding measures being taken to enforce Covid protocols during the Kumbh and had constituted a committee to check the arrangements on the ground in Haridwar and submit its report. The central team, led by Dr S K Singh, director of National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had visited Haridwar on March 16 and 17 to review the medical and public health preparedness measures being undertaken by the state for the mela which will officially start from April 1 and end on April 30. There are three shahi snans (royal bathing processions) of akhadas during this period — on April 12, 14 and 27. With over 12 states in the country seeing another wave of surge in cases of Covid-19, the Union health secretary expressed concern in his letter that pilgrims expected to visit Haridwar during the Kumbh Mela could also be from these states. The letter advises the state government to “scrupulously follow the SOPs issued by the ministry of health and family welfare and display signages to disseminate the main points of these SOPs.” “There should be an increase in awareness of self-reporting, especially among the local population, in case of symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 and the state must set up a system for generating early warning signals in areas with susceptible populations,” the health secretary’s letter says. It goes on to add that there should be “enhanced testing in potential high transmission areas along with periodic testing of frontline workers before and after auspicious snan days of the Kumbh.” “Ensure operationalisation of adequate critical care treatment facilities and effective risk communication by using all forms of media platforms for strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour. In case of surge in cases/super spreader events, promptly send samples for genome sequencing in consultation with NCDC,” the letter adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/have-stringent-measures-to-control-covid-spread-during-kumbh-centre-to-ukhand/articleshow/81619827.cms||Ishita Mishra

The decision came after a request was made by farmers living along Kudavelly Vagu in Dubbak assembly constituency. Finance minister T Harish Rao on Sunday visited Kodakandla to examine the possibility of releasing the water from Kaleshwaram canal into Kudavelly Vagu. He called up KCR on phone from the spot and informed him that the water can be released into Kudavelly only after diverting the water from Mallanna Sagar to Konda Pochamma Sagar canal at Kodakandla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/water-released-to-irrigate-over-11000-acres/articleshow/81621413.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The elderly Covid patient required immediate hospitalization but the family members were clueless about where to take him. A close friend provided them a Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) helpline number but no one answered the repeated calls. Later, on Sunday morning, the 108 ambulance service provider too refused to help stating they can only take him to a government hospital while the family wanted to treat him at a private one. Finally, the family paid Rs2,500 to shift the elderly man to a private hospital around 5km away. Similarly, a school teacher from Narendra Nagar faced problems in searching a bed at government hospital as well as getting an ambulance after the condition of her elderly Covid positive relatives began to worsen late in the night. With the rise in cases, complaints from citizens not able to easily find a Covid hospital or ambulance are rapidly increasing. The civic and district administration are believed to be running Covid helplines, which the citizens say are not working. Those who were able to connect were unhappy with the response. When TOI called up the number, the response was unsatisfactory. GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said a lot of breathless patients are directly walking in without any referral. “Some private hospitals too have started dumping critical patients without giving prior information. We are not refusing anyone but prior information helps in making necessary arrangements,” he said. Doctors said referrals by civic officials were important to tackle the imminent Covid crises and better manage admissions. The school teacher said her elderly relatives had to be admitted at one place as the man was hard on hearing and needed assistance from his wife. They were offered one bed at one of the medical colleges while the other expressed regret. “We understand the situation is extraordinary but there is no guidance at all. The patients were admitted after a 24 hour scramble. I spent an hour calling the NMC helpline before giving up. Ambulance too was not available. Finally, we had to rely on friends and relatives and got admission in a private hospital just because it turned into full Covid centre to make beds available,” she said. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chiklar said beds have dried up at GMCH and IGGMCH. “They are opening more wards from Monday, so there will be more bed. Zone-level ambulance are busy shifting patients. We are also sending patients to Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya. The call centres too guiding people on the bed vacancy position,” he said. The teacher said, “This is a hopeless situation. We can’t completely blame the administration but there has to be a way out.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-helplines-silent-kin-of-covid-patients-helpless/articleshow/81620604.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

In a clear indication of the importance accorded to the task, the Navy decided that its third air squadron should comprise of maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine aircraft. So, on March 21, 1961, the Indian Navy commissioned the INAS 310, also known as the Cobras. This foresight has reaped rich dividends. The INAS 310 holds the distinction of being the most decorated unit of the Indian Navy. To mark the completion of 60 years, the squadron organised a get-together for veterans on Sunday where former pilots of the Alizé aircraft as well as serving officers and crew of the Dornier 228 squadrons met up to share notes. Aside from a fly-past by the Dorniers, the Navy’s MARCOS demonstrated combat free fall operations including a high altitude-low opening jump. The INAS squadron began life with the French Breguet Br. 1050 Alizé aircraft and slowly transitioned to the German Dornier – 228 aircraft to undertake anti-submarine operations, reconnaissance and ELINT (electronic intelligence). INAS 310, which is based at INS Hansa, saw its first combat action in the liberation of Goa in December 1961. The Cobras subsequently played a role in 1965 Indo-Pak war and the 1971 war which led to the liberation of Bangladesh. “We were flying sorties from Jamnagar to pick up details from enemy posts and give the information to the Indian Airforce,” said Commodore R Seshadri Vasan, who served as a tactical coordinator aboard the Alize between 1972-76. The Alize’s were later deployed as part of Operation Pawan, to assist Sri Lanka in their fight against the LTTE. In a clear testament to the capabilities and skill of the men of INAS 310, the Cobras were also called upon during the Kargil conflict to carry out ELINT and electronic warfare operations to support the Indian Army and the Air Force. “INAS 310 and the Alize’s formed the basis for the Navy’s long-range maritime surveillance role. It has been a phenomenal journey. Nobody can take away what the Alize contributed to the Indian Navy in the three decades of its operations, whether it is shore-based operations to maritime operations,” said Vasan, who today serves as the regional director at the Chennai Chapter of National Maritime Foundation and Director of Chennai Centre for China Studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/navys-most-decorated-unit-cobras-completes-60-years/articleshow/81621442.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Chandigarh||Now, women don’t have to go to police stations, can just dial 181 to lodge complaints||Ludhiana: The women in distress need not go to police station to lodge complaints anymore. Neither will they have to feel uncomfortable explaining to policemen. From now on, all complaints related to women will be dealt by police women, in a friendly environment. This has been made possible with the recently launched 181 Saanjh Shakti helpline and of Punjab Police Mahila Mitar, a women help desk. Importantly, special help desks have been established at all Saanjh Kendras by the police administration where police women have been deputed to listen to the grievances of women, elderly people and children as well. With the aim of providing a hassle free, friendly and easy system of lodging a complaint, the police administration and the state government have come up with these initiatives. Thus, women with any kind of complaint can either dial 181 or can walk into Saanjh Kendras, rather than going to police station. Commissioner of police (CP) Rakesh Agarwal said, “The basic idea behind is to make the entire process of lodging complaints easy. There are two major initiatives, one is the Punjab Police Mahila Mitar. This is a help desk, established at all Saanjh Kendras,where women can lodge any kind of complaint — be it some harassment, matrimonial disputes or related to cyber crime. These will be dealt with women. Secondly, there is a 24x7 helpline 181 Saanjh Shakti, which is launched on Women’s Day.” According to CP, calls on 181 also will mostly be answered by police women. “Most importantly, victims will not be called to police station. The female cops will deal with the complaints and resolve it,” he added. Additional deputy commissioner of police-1, Pragya Jain, who is also incharge of Saanjh Kendra said, “There are a few things which are behind this idea. It is observed that women feel too comfortable explaining their issues among all male cops or at times they are not in the situation ot visit the police station. Therefore, the police administration is giving them the friendly atmosphere of Saanjh Kendras and facility of lodging complaints over the phone call. For any complaint related to elderly persons, women, girls, children they just have to dial 181 or visit nearest Saanjh Kendras.” “We have seen often that girls who face teasing or harassment are scared to tell even their families about it. I would request them to just dial 181 and inform police. They will not be called to police station and their identity will also be kept a secret,” she added. According to ADCP Jain, “These two schemes have been launched and now our focus is to make women aware of it. We are already doing awareness through social media and now are also planning to send bulk SMSs for the awareness.” Police using catchy lines and songs for awareness The police are making best use of social media, such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter to spread awareness of 24x7 women helpline. Moreover, they are using catchy lines and songs to grab the attention- including ‘Munda Tu Luck Tera’, ‘Behaviour Sambhal ni’, ‘One in million danda lagda kamaal ni’, ‘Na kudiyaan nu eddan tadeya kro, enna vi na akh-wakh mareya kro’ and ‘Ruk toh ja to hang on, yeh to bta woh hai kaun’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/now-women-dont-have-to-go-to-police-stations-can-just-dial-181-to-lodge-complaints/articleshow/81620601.cms||Payal Dhawan

Section 153 (A) is used for punishing persons who indulge in wanton vilification or attacks upon the religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc of any particular group or class or upon the founders and prophets of a religion. However, Randhawa remained defiant and said that he stands by his actions. Speaking to TOI, Randhawa said, “An FIR has been filed against me but I haven’t done anything wrong. I will continue my campaign. We will put the same banners outside the temples of Rishikesh on Monday.” Meanwhile, the office-bearers of Hindu Yuva Vahini (HYV) have said that they will be “writing letters to priests and owners of every temple of the state to stop a display of Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb and ‘becoming secular’ when it comes to religion”. In a meeting of the HYV office-bearers on Sunday, its state president Govind Wadhwa said, “Temple committees should hand over any non-Hindu entering their temple premises either to the police or inform us.” He added that “temple committees that show unnecessary Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb will be boycotted and new committees will be constituted in their place.” Wadhwa further said, “We have to show to the society that the Hindus are united. Hindus must realise that they have to come forward for the protection of their faith as the government cannot take every responsibility on its shoulders. Our temples should not be polluted.” In a similar vein, HYV state vice-president Lalit Sharma said that Hindus must ensure that their daughters are able to go to temples without any fear. “We all must work together to safeguard our religion. The temples will have to boycott becoming secular,” he added. The HYV drive comes days after a teenage boy from the minority community was assaulted for drinking tap water at the Dasna Devi temple in Ghaziabad. The temple has a board that says that ‘Muslims are not allowed inside’ which has been put up on the directions of the temple’s head priest (mahant) Yati Narasimhanand Saraswati. Randhawa has said that the ongoing drive in Uttarakhand is intended to extend support to Mahant Saraswati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hindu-yuva-vahini-ukhand-gen-secy-booked-for-putting-up-banners-boycotting-entry-of-non-hindus-in-temples/articleshow/81619835.cms||Ishita Mishra

He also wanted works on other pending projects in Krishna Basin to be completed on a war footing. “Certain vested interested have created problems and obstacles for the completion of the Palamuru-Rangareddy project by filing cases in the courts and getting stay orders. Yet we are going ahead with the works with determination. We have completed projects like Kalwakurty, Nettempad, Bhima and Jurala and converted 11 lakh acres in south Palamuru into fertile land,” he said. The upper riparian states of Krishna river like Karnataka and Maharashtra are constructing projects and the neighbouring state is taking away water through pipes and due to lack of rain, availability of water in Krishna has been on the decline and has reached danger levels. Against this backdrop, the rightful share of the state in Krishna water should be utilised to the last drop. For this, all the pending projects on Krishna river, including Palamuru-Rangareddy, should be completed on a war footing, he said. The CM said Krishna water should be diverted to transform Palamuru into a fertile and crop-yielding area. This project can be linked to Jurala. Officials have been given funds to take up the works without waiting for a green signal from Hyderabad. When the government is extending such support to the engineers, they should put their heart and complete the works, the CM added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/complete-palamuru-rangareddy-irrigation-scheme-by-year-end-kcr-tells-officials/articleshow/81621412.cms||Roushan Ali

The Congress floor leader demanded that the TRS government must make its stand clear on central government’s privatisation spree of PSUs.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala assembly polls 2021: LDF may spring a surprise in UDF stronghold||KOCHI: Ernakulam constituency has been a traditional stronghold of the United Democratic Front (UDF), but this time around it won’t be a cakewalk for the coalition candidate. While Congress’ sitting MLA T J Vinod, who won by a margin of mere 3,673 votes in the 2019 bypoll, is looking to increase his majority and retain the seat, LDF, which won Kochi Corporation in the 2020 local body polls, is aiming to wrest the seat from the UDF by fielding an independent, Shaji George, a social and public figure. Vinod, who has been an MLA for fewer than 18 months, is upbeat about UDF increasing its majority. "I did not get much time to serve as an MLA and then the pandemic set in. But I was able to launch many new projects, besides completing the ones begun by Hibi Eden. There is anti-incumbency in the state and UDF will win the polls," Vinod said. LDF is hoping that by supporting George, a leader of Kerala Region Latin Catholic Council who has the church’s support, it will secure the votes of the Latin Catholic community. George who actively takes part in the issues faced by the fishing community is banking on the personal contacts he has developed over the last two decades to turn them into votes. "People want the continuity of LDF government and there is a great chance for the front in Ernakulam too," George said. Mahila Morch state secretary Padmaja S Menon, a journalist and daughter of veteran trade union leader late SCS Menon, is the NDA candidate. "Our aim is not to increase the vote share but to win the constituency. We will make a dent in the traditional vote banks of UDF and LDF. Our campaign will focus on basic issues like waterlogging, unclean canals, unscientific roads," Menon said. The presence of regional players like Twenty20 and V4 People Party, will also prove to be a decisive factor. While Twenty20 has chosen Leslie Pallath, another Latin Catholic and former principal of St Albert’s College, V4 People has picked Sujith Sukumaran, a 43-year-old techie, as its candidate. Both parties are looking to sway the neutral voters with their new approach to politics. The traditional vote bank of LDF is very unlikely to be breached but the UDF does not rule out the possibility of making a dent in its vote bank. If George manages to woo the Latin Catholic community and if BJP increases its vote share while Twenty20 and V4 People manage to garner some of the neutral votes, the possibility of LDF scoring an upset win in Ernakulam cannot be ruled out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ldf-may-spring-a-surprise-in-udf-stronghold/articleshow/81621415.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

---||Lucknow||CM launches FPO Shakti portal to benefit farmers||Gorakhpur/Lucknow: Stepping up farmer-centric measures, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday launched a UP Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO) Shakti portal, a first of its kind in the country, to benefit farmers at grass roots level. The CM launched the portal as part of Kisan Kalyan Mission at an event in Gorakhpur. The FPO-centric portal will bring farmers, producer groups, traders, agriculture and other allied departments of UP government on one platform. Lauding the efforts of agriculture department, Yogi said UP had taken precedence in introducing various agri reforms. “The country’s first portal, fully dedicated to farmers, is another step in agriculture reforms,” he said. The event was attended by nearly 3,000 farmers. Besides using the portal, farmers can also download UP FPO Shakti app on their android phones for easy access. The UP government’s initiative will enable farmers to expand their market base, reduce dependency on mandis and facilitate national and trans-boundary trade. The portal has been developed with technical and funding support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). According to officials, the farmers will be able to download necessary documents required to form organizations. Each FPO will have its own section that will comprise of details of its members. The portal will contain all information on FPOs, their key activities, organizational structure and products. The portal, officials said, would facilitate speedy resolution of disputes. Currently, the state has 576 FPOs comprising around 2.15 lakh farmers. Of these, 471 FPOs have registered themselves on the portal. A farmer will also get relevant information on specific subjects around one’s village/block/district or state. The information will be delivered through texts, emails or audio/video in a language that one can easily understand. The initiative comes amid the BJP government’s resolve to double the income of farmers by 2022. Officials said the portal would play a significant role in meeting national objectives, such as generating employment, reducing malnutrition and empowering women, among others. “The portal provides practical interface between buyers and FPOs to engage with each other. This demand-led production will drive transformation in Indian agriculture,” said Amit Vatsyayan of Ernst and Young.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-launches-fpo-shakti-portal-to-benefit-farmers/articleshow/81622023.cms||Arjumand Bano

Marriguda police said that the deceased, E Srisailam, had extensively campaigned for Mallanna before the election. “On Sunday, Srisailam went to a hut near his house in Marriguda and consumed poison. His family members grew suspicious and followed him, however, Srisailam had already consumed the poison and died while undergoing treatment at a hospital,” police said. Meanwhile, Srisailam’s family members denied that the death was due to Mallanna’s defeat. “Srisailam’s family members said that he was reprimanded by his parents as he was unemployed and was actively getting involved in politics. They suspect that Srisailam was upset over this and committed suicide,” Marriguda sub-inspector Kranthi Kumar said. Police said that Srisailam studied up to Class 9 and has been doing odd jobs to support his family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/upset-over-mallannas-defeat-supporter-commits-suicide/articleshow/81621416.cms||---

The minors had gone missing on Saturday, hours after they set out to play near their houses. The younger child later returned home crying and narrated the ordeal to his parents. The family alerted police and a complaint was registered at Khatauli police station after the body of the 9-year-old who had also gone missing since Saturday afternoon was recovered from a field. Police claim the same suspect is behind both the incidents which happened around the same time. Muzaffarnagar senior superintendent of police Abhishek Yadav said, “The 6-year-old child told us about the assault by a man from the same village. In the evening, we learnt about another child who was missing and his body was recovered. Both the incidents are similar in nature and happened around the same time in the village. The accused have been arrested.” According to police, the suspect, Jabar Singh, was accused of the double murder of his uncle and aunt in 2009 in Meerut’s Transport Nagar area. He was arrested by Meerut Police and spent seven years in jail before he was bailed out five years ago. Police said Jabar Singh's family – wife and a kid – had already left him and he had been living alone in his house in the village for a long time. Police have sent the body for the postmortem and started investigation. The accused has been booked under various sections, including IPC’s 302 (murder) and provisions of the Pocso Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/double-murder-accused-out-on-bail-abducts-rapes-2-kids-kills-one-of-them/articleshow/81619294.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Nagpur||Doctors asking close contact for RT-PCR –ve report before inoculation||NAGPUR: Amid high number of beneficiaries testing positive within days of getting vaccinated, doctors have started asking them to wait for five days if they are close contact of a Covid patient and get an RT-PCR test in case they have symptoms. This is being done to ensure beneficiaries don’t doubt the vaccine in case they test positive. Doctors lamented lack of clear guidelines regarding vaccination of those who are testing positive. On March 21, TOI reported that a lot of Covid patients admitted in different hospitals have taken the first dose, while some of them had taken both the doses. Doctors said these patients had come for vaccination in panic after someone in their family tested positive. “We are now asking if anyone in their family has test positive in last two weeks. In case they turn out to be close contacts of a positive person, we recommend RT-PCR,” doctors said. Dr Ashok Jadhao, head, department of community medicine at IGGMCH, said all beneficiaries can’t be recommended RT-PCR. “Ideally, contact tracing is done and people are tested. In case a beneficiary tests positive, s/he must defer it by 8 to 12 weeks from the day of result,” he said. Sengupta Hospital director Dr Shantanu Sengupta said if beneficiaries have any symptoms or signs like fever, cough or cold they must anyway avoid taking the jab . “Or if they have come in close contact before the vaccination schedule date, they must defer it. The infection can flare up if a person is jabbed. This is also being studied. Also, after 45 days of infection, antibody test has to be done and if the level is good, you need to wait more,” he said. Kunal Hospital director Dr Shishir Shrivastav the bigger reason behind getting a RTPCR is the beneficiary shouldn’t blame the vaccine afterwards. Infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayade said inocluation of this group coincided with the vaccination drive. “The infectivity is high this time so mostly they were already exposed. If one is a close contact, then wait five days. If symptoms appear then avoid the jab. If no symptom, then one can go for inoculation with or without PCR.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doctors-asking-close-contact-for-rt-pcr-ve-report-before-inoculation/articleshow/81620636.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The government is not sparing any spoils of the illegal, monopolistic trade whether it is in the name of the spouses or the aides of gangsters who have been ruling the roost for decades. As a result, the mafia dons are haplessly watching their empires crumbling and assets falling apart. The ill-gotten wealth of jailed mafia dons Mukhtar Ansari, Dhruv Singh alias Kuntu, Vijay Mishra, who ran their syndicates and illegal business through their wives, has been targeted by the government in its crackdown on organized crime in UP. Similarly, other musclemen politicians, like Vijay Mishra, who catapulted their wives in the political arena and made them owners of immovable properties grabbed by them, are also facing the heat. Azamgarh witnessed razing of over polytechnic building, worth Rs 10 crore, owned by Kuntu’s wife Vandana Singh-led trust. Azamgarh DM Rajesh Kumar said, “After investigation revealed gram sabha land transfer, change of land use and recognition to the polytechnic on the basis of forged documents, an FIR was lodged against Vandana Singh and other trust members. The college was being constructed with illegally earned money of the don and so it was demolished.” Kuntu, who is lodged in jail for being an accused in killing of Samajwadi Party’s ex-MLA Sarvesh Singh Sipu in July 2015, had already suffered financial loss of over Rs 13 crore in crackdown, said ADG Varanasi zone Brij Bhushan. Land worth Rs 8 crore of Kuntu had been confiscated in 2020 while his buildings in Chhapra Sultanpur of Jiyanpur were demolished a day after his involvement in January 6 killing of Ajit Singh in Lucknow came to light.” As per records of ADG office, Kuntu is the second biggest loser after Mukhtar Ansari and has lost assets over Rs 258 crore so far. “Mukhtar’s properties worth Rs 58.41 crore had been confiscated, while cost of his buildings demolished and grabbed land is Rs 140.55 crore,” the ADG said. Most immovable properties of Mukhtar gang on grabbed government land were owned by Vikas Construction of his wife Afsha Ansari. Initially, a case of embezzlement and was registered against Afsha by Saidpur police in 2016 and then another of illegal trespass and embezzlement by Kotwali police in 2019. On July 9, 2020, Dakshintola police lodged a case against proprietors of Vikas Constructions including Afsha for grabbing gram sabha land, said SP Mau Sushil Ghule adding their illegal possession was removed in August. In July 2020, Afsha’s 4.1696 hectare plot in Fatehullapur worth Rs 22.13 crore was confiscated and her hotel Ghazal was demolished in Ghazipur in October 2020. A non-bailable warrant was issued against her in September 19 but she got interim bail from High Court, said SP Ghazipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/lady-luck-stops-smilingat-mafia-dons-of-east-up/articleshow/81621570.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Out of this, 1,320 MW generation will start from this year. With the commissioning of new thermal power projects in UP, the capacity of the state’s production houses will increase to 12,734MW. This includes generation of 9,434MW by the UP Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam and 3,300 MW from joint ventures. According to a government spokesperson, the new thermal power plants which will increase the power generation capacity of the state include Meja power plant where two 660 MW units are being installed under a joint venture of UPRVUN and NTPC at an estimated cost of Rs 12,176 crore. Having commissioned 660 MW in April last year, the power plant will see its second unit of 660 MW getting fired up later this year. Similarly, a 660MW unit in Harduaganj would start generating power later this year. The under-construction two units of 660-660 MW each of Obra-C will start operating by March 2022. Likewise, the Jawaharpur thermal project, which is being constructed at a cost of Rs 10,566 crore will see commissioning of two units of 660MW each by March 2022. The three under-construction units of 660 MW in Ghatampur is also targetted to start operation from May 2022. According to the UP Power Department officials, the plan is afoot to increase the power generation in the state within due time. Along with this, as many as 1.38 crore power connections have been given in the last four years. For the first time in the state, the government has brought to an end the VIP culture by bringing ‘uniformity’ in power supply throughout the state. This is in contrast to the previous regime when the proper power supply was limited to ‘only five districts’ and that too at the cost of the remaining districts, the spokesperson said. The people of the state, he said, have observed that during the rule of the SP and BSP governments, the home districts of the top leaders of these parties were ensured round- the-clock power supply. “Now the scenario is changed and the roster of electricity supply is scheduled for 24 hours at the district headquarters, 22 hours at the tehsil headquarters and 18 hours in the villages with no power cut in the rural after sunset,” officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/six-up-plants-to-start-generating-7260mw/articleshow/81622030.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Even as the Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) and TSRTC resumed operations, MMTS remains the only public transportation that is still unavailable for commuters in the city. Commuters, who used to depend on MMTS, have started demanding that South Central Railway (SCR) restart the service. M Sushmita, a data operator at a private company said, “I used to travel from Begumpet to Lingampally every day on MMTS. The two-way ticket used to cost me about Rs 10. Now I spend Rs 200 on auto for a one-way trip. There are a few buses, but the timings don’t match.” Before Covid-19, MMTS services had a ridership of around 1.6 lakh passengers per day through 121 services. Another passenger, M Rajaiah, said: “MMTS was available at a very low cost to travel long distances in the city. While Metro Rail is available, it is not affordable by a lot of people, especially the daily wage workers like us, who would use Metro for their daily travel.” In February, Union minister of state for home and Secunderabad MP G Kishan Reddy requested chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to hold talks with railway officials and see that the suburban train services of MMTS phase-I were started forthwith. In a letter to the chief minister, the minister pointed out that common people, especially students, employees, labour and others were being badly affected due to the non-resumption of the services as MMTS suburban services were most economical, safe and eco-friendly public transport available in twin cities. He also stated that MMTS services came to a halt in March last year due to the pandemic and the consequent lockdown. However, the local train services have resumed operations in Mumbai and other places, he said. SCR conducted a trial run on the Secunderabad-Malkajgiri and Medchal-Moula-Ali routes as part of the phase-II project in September last. The officials informed TOI that they were waiting for an official order from the Railway Board to resume operations. “We are ready to start operations as soon as we receive the orders. Till then, we are conducting other maintenance activities by regularly checking the rakes, batteries, brakes, wheel alignment, functioning of engine and other motors. To resume services, it is also the responsibility of the state government to seek approval by detailing the Covid-19 situation in the state,” a senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/suspension-of-mmts-services-irks-commuters/articleshow/81622027.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Delhi||Delhi: Random tests to be conducted outside railway stations, airport||NEW DELHI: In the wake of recent surge in Covid-19 cases in the capital, passengers arriving at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport and railway stations will be randomly tested for novel coronavirus, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Monday ordered.  The authority stressed on random testing at both these places particularly of passengers coming from states with high incidences of Covid cases, and has advised caution and regulation ahead of Holi. According to sources, DDMA also discussed the Covid situation in the wake of Holi and deliberation was made on whether the government should curb public celebration of the festival. No final decision was taken, however, it is likely that DDMA may take a final call on it in a couple of days. In the past 24 hours, 84% Covid cases have been reported from five states. Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh are witnessing a consistent surge in the Covid cases. Passengers coming from these states are more likely to be included for random testing at the stations and the airport. The decision for random testing was taken in the wake of the upcoming festivals. The daily Covid cases are consistently rising in Delhi for the past several days, and in the past 24 hours 888 new cases have been reported. At the DDMA meeting, which was chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, discussions on the prevailing situation was done with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, health minister Satyendar Jain, revenue minister Kailash Gahlot, AIIMS director Dr R Guleria, Balram Bhargava of ICMR and others. “After detailed deliberation with experts, and keeping in view the recent increase in Covid-19 cases, the need to be more vigilant and ensuring strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour was emphasised,” the LG tweeted. As advised by experts, DDMA directed the officials to continue with the existing strategy of cluster-based surveillance, testing and genome sequencing. Each of the district is currently conducting 5,000- 6,000 daily Covid tests with more RT-PCR tests being done than rapid antigen tests. On average, each district has been tracing 28 to 34 contacts for each positive case. “The contacts include those who have come in contact with the positive person. Since the movement of people is greater compared to the lockdown period, the number of contacts is also high,” an official said. The LG also stressed on the need to ramp up vaccine coverage with greater outreach and focused information, education and communication campaign, with special emphasis on marginalised/poor sections without access to digital platform.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/random-tests-to-be-conducted-outside-railway-stations-airport/articleshow/81640300.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Mumbai||Ambani bomb scare: Now, ED to start probe against Sachin Waze to establish money trail||NEW DELHI: In what started as a terror probe by the ATS (Anti-Terrorism Squad) after a gelatin stick laden Mahindra Scorpio was found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in Mumbai, has now expanded into a multi-agency investigation into a terror-cum-extortion racket operated with the alleged blessings of top ministers and police officers. A top source said the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is waiting for the preliminary investigation report from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to launch its own money laundering probe under the stringent Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against main accused Sachin Waze, a sub inspector posted with the Crime Intelligence Unit of the Mumbai police and the main suspect behind Mukesh Ambani terror case. Waze’s call records and allegations made by his superiors have revealed he was directly taking orders from Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. The probe against Waze, who is currently in NIA custody, is likely to be taken over by the ED to establish a money trail in the alleged terror-cum-extortion racket, in which the role of some senior ministers of the Sena-NCP-Congress government is not ruled out. On Saturday afternoon, former Mumbai police Commissioner Param Bir Singh sent a letter to the chief minister and the governor of Maharashtra stating that home minister Anil Deshmukh had given a target to Waze and some other senior cops for “collection” of Rs 100 crore every month.  The claims made by the former Mumbai police commissioner have rattled the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government with Sharad Pawar of the NCP, one of the three constituents of the MVA besides Shiv Sena and Congress, leaving the decision of sacking the home minister to CM Uddhav Thackery. The BJP has already demanded removal of Deshmukh and demanded a multi-agency probe into the extortion racket. The former Mumbai police commissioner has alleged that the conversation related to collection of Rs 100 crore between Waze and the state home minister took place in presence of the latter’s personal secretary Palande at the Home minister’s residence. Singh has also placed on record as evidence his conversations with other senior cops, including Waze’s supervisory authority, an ACP rank official, corroborating these facts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbainow-ed-to-start-probe-against-waze-to-establish-money-trail/articleshow/81622029.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||Delhi||Delhi: Jab centres to work overtime for 3-fold rise in daily shots||NEW DELHI: From Monday, vaccination will be carried out from 9am to 9pm at all Delhi government hospitals as announced by the chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday. Hospital authorities said they have made arrangements, including deployment of additional staff, to carry out 12-hour-long inoculation drives every day. On Thursday, Kejriwal had said that Delhi government is going to give vaccine jabs to 1.25 lakh beneficiaries per day, instead of the 30,000-40,000 shots a day currently. The CM had also promised doubling the vaccination centres and keeping the Delhi government ones open till 9 pm for inoculation, instead of the usual 5 pm. An order was issued on Thursday itself, where all Delhi government hospitals were directed to carry out vaccination from 9am to 9pm, starting Monday. The hospital authorities have also been directed to increase the number of vaccination sites to at least six at their facilities. There would be two vaccinators at each of these sites, for which additional healthcare personnel have been deployed. “We were giving out 200 jabs at each of our two vaccine sites every day, from one site at night, with a total 500 people being inoculated every day. Arrangements have been made for starting six vaccination sites as we were asked to do,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of the LNJP hospital, the largest Covid-19 facility in the capital. “While these sites will be operational from morning to evening, one site will be operational 24 hours,” he said. Dr BL Sherwal, medical director of the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital, said that all arrangements have been made for the increase in both the timing of the drive and number of vaccination sites. Hospital authorities have also reached out to the district administration for some arrangements. “We will be starting inoculation at six sites from Monday from 9 am to 9 pm. Additional deployment had to be made, but since the number of indoor patients is low at the moment, we were able to manage,” he said. The CM had also said that the number of vaccination sites would be increased from around 500 at present to total 1,000 and it is expected that the figure would be reached by the end of this month. He had appealed to the Centre to decentralise the vaccination system, exert less control over it and allow the state governments to administer the vaccine on a war footing. More than nine lakh people, including healthcare workers and frontline workers, have been vaccinated against Covid-19 in the capital till now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jab-centres-to-work-overtime-for-3-fold-rise-in-daily-shots/articleshow/81621456.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Nagpur||1.62 lakh senior citizens, comorbids take Covid vaccine; Nagpur third highest in Maharashtra||NAGPUR: Around 1.62 lakh people from age-appropriate groups have taken the Covid-19 vaccine in three weeks in the district. Among 35 districts in the state, Nagpur is third highest in inoculation of senior citizens and comorbid. With spike in positive cases and deaths due to Covid-19 in the district over last three weeks, guardian minister Nitin Raut in a meeting on Sunday directed Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Zilla Parishad (ZP) to chalk out a programme to vaccinate bedridden senior citizens and comorbid in the district. He also directed the two authorities to explore possibility of vaccinating people by going to residential areas by developing Mobile Vaccination Centres. To expedite the vaccinations, Raut had on Saturday directed NMC and ZP to increase vaccination from existing 20,000 per day to 40,000 per day. The minister had also asked to increase number of vaccination centres from existing 159 to 300. As per data of state’s public health department, 1,26,329 people from 60+ age group and 35,202 from 45+ with specified comorbidities took the jab for a total of 1,61,531 from age-appropriate groups. In Mumbai, 4,59,623 people from age-appropriate groups have been vaccinated followed by 2,53,898 in Pune. Despite having higher population than Nagpur district, inoculation of senior citizens and comorbid in Thane (1,53,555) and Nashik (92,818) is less. As per a statement from divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar two weeks ago, around 6 lakh people are expected to be among the age-appropriate groups in the district. Considering this number, 27% have been covered in three weeks. Raut had on Saturday quoted the number at 6.78 lakh. At present, 74 vaccination centres are in operation in city. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B had submitted a proposal with the state government seeking permission to begin inoculation at 30 private hospitals which are not empanelled under government schemes. The NMC has also planned to add eight more urban primary health centres (UPHCs) in vaccination programme. The team of NMC led by Radhakrishnan, additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar have engaged 100 staffers with laptops for registration of eligible people by conducting special camps in residential areas. Registration facility has also been provided at offices of all ten zones. Also, some public representatives have facilitated registration at their offices. ZP CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar increased centres to 85 across Nagpur Rural. Vaccination has started in all primary health centres (PHCs), with each PHC attached to villages. The teams of ZP are visiting all houses and identifying eligible people. The civic body has also allowed staffers of medical shops under healthcare workers (HCWs) category. Also, employees of Indian Railways have been permitted vaccination under frontline workers (FLWs) category. Vaccine was first rolled out for HCWs on January 16. HCWs have continued to take first dose. Number of HCWs who took first dose increased to 48,172. Second dose of 20,171 has been completed. Vaccination of FLWs was started from February 5, and 30,477 FLWs have taken first dose of which 7,139 have also taken second dose in the district.

At least six gunmen on motorcycles opened indiscriminate fire at an SUV. Sitting at the rear, Dharmpal, now 60, was not new to such an attack. In 2019, he lost his brother, Jagpal, to bullets. Last year it was his father, Kalicharan. And on Sunday afternoon, Dharmpal lost his son, Sandeep, 28. Protected by an armed policeman due to an old political rivalry, the family was returning home from a field when it was ambushed near Dhanora village. Dharmpal, his wife and police gunner Biswendra were injured in the attack and rushed to a Noida hospital. Sandeep was hit in the head and had died in the vehicle. “The moment we slowed down at a turn, five assailants waylaid us and opened fire. I loaded my carbine and opened fire in retaliation. It was a premeditated attack and they were waiting for us,” Biswendra said. Dharmpal had been the main witness in the murder of his father. He will now stand in the witness box for his son. Bulandshahr’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Santosh Kumar Singh said, “Several teams have been formed to identify and trace the accused. We will soon have a breakthrough.” The string of murders goes back to 1990. “At least four persons had died during a clash around Holi in 1990. Entire Dhanora village was divided between two warring factions, one supporting Dharmpal and the other Amit,” the SSP added. Dharmpal’s mother Sringari Devi was killed in 2005. Police believe that Amit and his three aides, who are in jail in connection with the murders of Jagpal and Kalicharan, orchestrated the attack. Amit’s mother was killed in 2007.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/after-father-mother-brother-man-now-loses-son-in-feud-between-two-families-that-goes-back-30-years/articleshow/81619298.cms||Piyush Rai
---||Lucknow||Opposition used farmers to grab power, misleading them: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||GORAKHPUR/LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath cautioned farmers to be wary of people who are trying to misguide them to fulfil their own ulterior motives. Addressing a farmers conference organised under Mission Kisan Kalyan at the Government Agricultural School campus in Gorakhpur on Sunday, Yogi said the people did not do anything for the welfare of farmers when they were in power are behind the conspiracy of misleading the peasants. “These people always used farmers to grab power and made their own fortunes while the farmers continued to languish in penury and debt,” Yogi said. In contrast, the BJP governments at Centre and in state have been working in the interest of farmers, the CM said. “These people who misled farmers have always been habitual liars. They spread the lie that farm land will be grabbed in contract farming, while PM Narendra Modi has already made it clear that contract farming is just another option, not an obligation and the farmers have full freedom to sell their produce in any market to earn more profit,” he said. Reiterating that no one can grab farmers’ land under contract farming, Yogi also allayed fears that Mandis would be closed. “Not a single mandi was closed since June 2020 after farm laws, but a deliberate misinformation campaign was run to misguide farmers,” he said. The CM said the mandis were added under the “e-NAM” concept of One Nation One Market. Training guns at the opposition, Yogi said the people behind the misinformation campaign were the ones who only sold and closed sugar mills in their regimes. He pointed out his government set up new sugar mills in Pipraich and Munderwa in east UP, while SP, BSP governments sold or closed sugar mills in Kushinagar, Deoria and Maharajganj. “The sugarcane farmers had thousands of crores of rupees of arrears. Our government made record payment of Rs 1.27 lakh crore to sugarcane farmers,” he reiterated. Yogi said the country will prosper only when farmers and villages become prosperous. He hailed the Modi government for doing unprecedented work for the welfare of farmers and included them in the agenda of the country’s politics. “Soil health test cards, payment of 1.5 times of MSP, PM Kisan Samman Nidhi and farmers’ loan waiver scheme, these have been some landmark welfare measures for the farmers under the guidance of PM Modi,” he said. Yogi said the sharecroppers were also provided cover of Rs 5 lakh under the Chief Minister’s farmer accident insurance scheme while pending irrigation projects were completed to increase productivity of farming. The CM said 68 lakh metric tonnes of paddy was procured at MSP this year and Rs 66,000 crore paid directly into the accounts of farmers. Besides, 2.42 crore farmers received more than Rs 27,000 crore under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/oppn-used-farmers-to-grab-power-misleading-them-cm/articleshow/81622037.cms||Arjumand Bano

Seven people succumbed to the viral disease, the highest since February 4. The number of active cases rose to 3,934 from 3,618 a day ago, while the case positivity remained over one % for the third consecutive day, according to the health bulletin issued by Delhi government. The 888 new infections, the highest in nearly three months, pushed the tally of Covid-19 cases reported in the city till now to 6,48,872, while over 6.3 lakh patients have recovered from the disease. Delhi had registered 823 cases on Sunday, 813 on Saturday, 716 on Friday, 607 on Thursday, 536 on Wednesday and 425 on Tuesday, according to the official data. The number of fatalities in the national capital linked to Covid-19 has risen to 10,963 with seven people dying from the pathogen in a day. This was the highest since February 4, when a similar number of fatalities were recorded. A total of 67,418 tests, including 48,981 RT-PCR, were conducted on Sunday, as the positivity rate rose to 1.32 from 1.03% a day ago, the bulletin said. The number of people under home isolation rose to 2,067 from 1,893 a day ago while containment zones increased to 805 from 766 on Sunday. The Covid-19 caseload in Delhi on January 1 had stood at over 6.2 lakh and total fatalities were 10,557. The number of daily cases had started to come down in February. On February 26, the month’s highest daily count of 256 cases was recorded. However, the daily cases have begun to rise again in March and it has been steadily increasing over the past few days. Till date in March, 9,583 cases have been recorded with an average of 436 per day. Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, said daily admissions for Covid-19 have nearly doubled over the past two-three weeks. “We are admitting seven to eight patients daily over the past week. Till last month, the daily admissions were limited to less than five,” he said. The increase in cases was reflected in the occupancy of beds reserved for Covid-19 patients in other hospitals also. In Holy Family Hospital, for example, 44% (23 out of 52) beds reserved for Covid-19 were occupied on Monday. The occupancy at Sir Ganga Ram, Jaipur Golden, Mas Shalimar Bagh and BLK hospitals stood at 68%, 48%, 42% and 59%, respectively, as per updates shared on the Delhi Corona App. The occupancy of Covid-19 ICU beds with and without ventilator support was 22% and 19%, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-800-cases-for-third-day-7-deaths/articleshow/81640309.cms||---

Presently, the ATS has 90 commandos. A senior police officer said that the 35 commandos will join the ATS after the completion of basic training at the Police Training School (PTS) in Valpoi. “The passing out parade was scheduled on March 17, but due to some reason it has been postponed,” the officer said. Pointing out that Goa receives frequent terror alerts as it is an international tourist destination, the senior officer said that increase in the squad’s strength will help cover the entire state in the event of any terror related issues. “Over the years, many anti-social elements and even terrorists have been arrested from Goa, so the ATS has to be vigilant,” the police officer said. Meanwhile, Goa police also conducted the physical proficiency test for ATS commandos to check their physical fitness. “In the presence of the ATS DySP, we conducted the 5km running test for the commandoes, followed with physical exercises. All commandos completed their running test in the scheduled time. No untoward incident was reported and no weapon was damaged,” the senior officer said. In all, 70 commandos were present for the physical proficiency test, the officer added. In December last year, Goa police successfully completed a three-day counter terror exercise with the National Security Guards (NSG). The objective of the drill, Gandiv-II, was to assess the capabilities and preparedness of NSG and the state machinery in responding to a worst-case terror strike across multiple locations simultaneously. Police said that the exercise checked the inter-operability of various departments and units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/35-commandos-set-to-join-goa-polices-anti-terror-squad/articleshow/81621461.cms||---

This will be the first national level archery event to be organised in the temple town. The announcement was made by additional chief secretary (home) and UPAA president, Awanish Awasthi, during the annual general meeting of the association at Lok Bhawan on Sunday. Talking to TOI, general secretary of UPAA Ajay Gupta said, “This is the first time that a national level archery competition is being organised in Ayodhya. The event will be titled Shri Ram Mahotsav and will be a national-level prize money tournament. The event is an attempt to promote archery in the state.” During the AGM, Awasthi appreciated the steps being taken by UPAA and assured all support from the government to promote the sport in the state. He added that players would also get weightage in recruitments in Uttar Pradesh police department. “Archery requires coordination between the brain and the body. The talent of players can be enhanced through better training. India has a special place in archery all over the world. Efforts should be made to give proper place to women archers in the programmes of women empowerment,” he said. The ACS added that archery should be promoted aggressively so that it is recognized not only at the national level but globally too. UPAA office-bearers discussed the provision of sports quota in Uttar Pradesh police and other departments.

---||Goa||Congress objects to e-auction of SEZ land||PANAJI: Objecting to Goa Industrial Development Corporation’s (GIDC) decision to e-auction 5 lakh sqm of industrial land which was re-possessed from the special economic zone (SEZ) promoters, Congress on Sunday demanded that the land should be allotted to Goan entrepreneurs. The party said that allotting the land to local entrepreneurs will aid industrial activity while also generating employment for locals. State Congress president Girish Chodankar also alleged that GIDC’s move to repay the seven SEZ promoters with interest was a scam which needs to be investigated by the CBI. “They are trying to sell the land through e-auction which we are objecting to. We demand that they should not do that but should instead make small plots and give to our entrepreneurs,” said Chodankar. Aside from asking for a CBI inquiry into the SEZ saga, particularly the out-of-court settlement, Chodankar also wants the comptroller and auditor general of India (CAG) to conduct an audit and investigate GIDC’s role in refunding the initial deposit paid by the SEZ promoters along with interest. Chodankar said that there were no directions from the Supreme Court, or the high court to pay interest to the SEZ promoters nor did GIDC norms require interest to be paid. The Congress chief alleged that the move to pay the interest was part of a scam for which former chief minister Manohar Parrikar and other state government officials received kickbacks. “When GIDC does not have money to pay their employees as per the seventh pay commission, they are negotiating and offering to pay Rs130 crore as interest to SEZ developers? I have written to the CAG demanding that a detailed study has to be done. We want to ask Vishwajit Rane to come clean and explain within seven days about his source of income and the various properties that he has acquired after this SEZ settlement,” he said. The state party chief also said that the government should not appoint a consultant to auction the SEZ land as it would amount to wastage of funds. He said that the state has the expertise to auction the land on its own, adding that once a Congress government returns to power it will launch an investigation into the SEZ matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-objects-to-e-auction-of-sez-land/articleshow/81621481.cms||---
---||Pune||Give health staff 2nd dose of Covid-19 vaccines fast to lift morale: Experts||PUNE: Public health experts and doctors in the region have now urged the administration to give waiting healthcare workers (HCWs) their second dose of Covid-19 vaccines as soon as possible. Scores of patient-facing health staff of private hospitals are days overdue for their follow-up shot. Delays had set in due to a shortage of Covishield vials. Private hospitals have now said that the second dose should not be delayed any further as key staffers are being readied to handle new Covid cases. Hospital administrators said completion of the vaccination schedule will increase staff morale and make them more confident while dealing with patients. Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director of Bharati, said many of the hospital staff are still waiting for the second shot of Covishield. He said, “For some days now, only civic-run hospitals have been administering Covishield. And the queues are long there. For HCWs then, options are limited. Private hospitals should be allowed to resume their Covishield sessions. We need to build confidence in our HCWs amid the rise in cases.” Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, said since most healthcare workers — part of the first priority group when the Covid vaccine drive began on January 16 — were first given Covishield, the administration should ensure adequate availability. “A special drive should be organised to cover the maximum number of beneficiaries who’re awaiting their second dose. It will generate enough confidence in them,” Patil said. Civic officials said the situation is much better than what it was a few days ago. Rubal Agarwal, additional commissioner of the PMC, said Covishield reserves have improved after the civic body got around 30,000 doses last week. “Hospital staff can approach civic sites if they want Covishield. Now that we have enough doses, hospitals can also purchase Covishield and conduct their own sessions,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/give-health-staff-2nd-dose-fast-to-lift-morale-experts/articleshow/81620653.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Delhi||Covid attacks in waves, but complacency remains one constant in Delhi’s markets||NEW DELHI: People visiting popular markets during the weekend have been giving a range of excuses for not wearing masks or keeping it hanging below their chins. The self-justification includes being unable to breathe properly while walking, fogging of spectacles or forgetting to carry a mask from home. When TOI visited Lajpat Nagar, Sarojini Nagar and Connaught Place on Sunday, rampant violations were witnessed. Social distancing was virtually non-existent with people gathering around hawkers and food stalls. Pushpa Market in Lajpat Nagar was so congested that people could barely walk without rubbing shoulders. Rampal Yadav, a hawker selling masks opposite South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s multilevel stack parking lot, said, “This disease affects only those who work in an airconditioned environment and have low immunity. Moreover, this is an open space, so the chance of getting infected is low,” he added. The two women who were buying masks from Yadav had a strange reason to share. “I got infected last year, so I don’t think I will catch it again,” said one of them. Sanjeev Madan, president of Lajpat Nagar Traders’ Association, said the careless attitude of people had forced them to approach the authorities to increase the number of civil defence volunteers. “We have issued fresh circulars to all shopkeepers to maintain social distancing, not allow entry to people without masks and do thermal scanning. While big shopkeepers are following the norms, small shops are flouting them,” he added. “People have become lax with the improvement in the situation. Last summer, they were wearing masks out of fear,” said Ashwani Marwah, general secretary of the association. At Sarojini Nagar, as soon as a team of New Delhi Municipal Council’s enforcement wing reached the market, all lanes occupied by hawkers and shopkeepers suddenly cleared up. “I often drag my mask to my chin because it’s too hot and I’m unable to breathe properly. Though Covid-19 cases may be increasing, that doesn’t mean we should stop living life at all,” said a man in his 30s. Ashok Randhawa, president of Sarojini Nagar Mini-Market Traders’ Association, said, “The rush is mainly in the rehri-patri market. We can only request customers to follow the norms. Strict measures can only be taken by the authorities.” An NDMC official said because of the huge footfall, it was not possible to screen everyone entering the markets. “We have formed a team of eight to keep a vigil on violators and issue challans. We are also taking action considering that Swachh Surveskhan will start from Friday,” he added. At CP, the crowd was thin, but violations rampant. Amit Gupta, exec member of New Delhi Traders’ Association said, “On weekdays, it’s rare to find anyone without a mask because of the intensive vigil by civil volunteers. But social distancing is still an issue due to hawkers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-attacks-in-waves-but-complacency-remains-one-constant-in-delhis-markets/articleshow/81621466.cms||Vibha Sharma

This had led to a major embarrassment for former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. In less than a week after BJP government, supported by NCP’s Ajit Pawar, lost majority, Singh, who then headed the Anti-Corruption Bureau, had submitted an affidavit in the high court giving a clean chit to Pawar in the irrigation scam case. His predecessor Sanjay Barve had, however, fixed Pawar’s responsibility in the case. Now when reminded, Fadnavis said notwithstanding what had happened, Singh’s allegations can’t be ignored. — Shishir Arya||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtraparambirs-clean-chit-to-ajit-had-embarrassed-bjp/articleshow/81622047.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Pune||Pimpri police arrest man in 2011 murder case||Pune: A tip-off led Pimpri police to arrest a man (32), who was on the run since 2011 in a murder case of a then 22-year-old woman. “The suspect, Kishore Ghare, was in a relationship with the woman. In 2011, they were working in the back office of a private company in Hinjewadi, and Ghare had promised to marry the woman,” sub-inspector AM Savarde of the Pimpri police told TOI. “The woman started pursuing Ghare for marriage. The couple would often argue and the latter would avoid her. On September 11, 2011, Ghare went to the woman’s house in Pimpri, told her they would marry the very day and took her away. He killed her in a forest near Urse in Maval,” Savarde added. The woman’s brother told TOI, “When my sister did not return home, we tried to contact her but her cellphone could not be reached, neither could we connect to Ghare.” The brother added, “My parents assumed that the newly-wed couple may have gone to Ghare’s native place and could not be reached due to poor connectivity. But, even after two months, my sister’s phone was not reachable.” “We contacted Ghare but he told us that she had left him after he refused to marry her,” he added. The brother said the family waited for the woman to return home for two years and only in July 2013 filed a complaint about a missing person with the Pimpri police. The family has registered four applications with the police as the woman could not be traced. Sub-inspector Savarde said, “The suspect was on the run for almost 10 years. About two months ago, he returned to Marunji near Hinjewadi and had started selling vegetables.” “Ghare told one of his acquaintances about the murder, he had committed 10 years ago. After a tip-off, he was taken into custody on Saturday. The victim’s mother has lodged an FIR against him,” Savarde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pimpri-police-arrest-man-in-2011-murder-case/articleshow/81620662.cms||---

According to Indian officials, on March 16, some Nepalese men started digging pits to construct a culvert along with some permanent structures in the area. Members of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) soon reached the spot and stopped their work. Tanakpur SDM, police and SSB jointly visited the site again the following day and had asked the Nepalese authority to remove the encroachment and "maintain status quo". "The authorities on the Nepalese side agreed to remove the encroachment," Himanshu Kafaltia, Tanakpur SDM, said, adding that till Sunday evening, no progress was made. "An official survey along the Indo-Nepal border from Lakhimpur to Tanakpur is pending due to the Covid pandemic . The survey will be conducted jointly by India and Nepal to install border pillars which were damaged or went missing. It will be done once the Covid situation improves," the SDM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/encroachment-along-indo-nepal-border-in-baramdev-area-not-yet-removed-say-officials/articleshow/81619873.cms||Prem Punetha
---||Pune||100 eateries booked but Pune rural residents say police missing violations||PUNE: Police in rural Pune, over the last week, took action against nearly 100 restaurants and small eateries for violating Covid-19 precautions. But citizens and activists said the number is far from adequate. Citizens said many establishments have been running full capacity and have stayed open beyond deadline. As per orders from the district collector, restaurants must operate at half capacity and should shut by 10pm. Rural Pune has about 5,000 restaurants and small eateries, mainly located along state and national highways that pass through the district. “We have filed 100 FIRs so far. The drive will be intensified in coming days,” said Abhinav Deshmukh, superintendent of police. Deshmukh added that night patrol units have warned and fined several establishments over the past many days. "We have also increased the number of checkpoints along state and national highways to restrict unnecessary movement," he said. The top official added that his teams carried out surprise checks of many eateries along the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway last week. “We found that owners of these establishments have reduced seating. But certain important Covid norms are still not being followed. We have now asked personnel from local police stations to check these businesses regularly,” Deshmukh said. Pune rural has recorded over 79,000 cases since the pandemic broke out last March. Some 74,000 went on to recover while 1,670 succumbed. Activist Balasaheb Chudhary, from Khed tehsil, said the police were not doing enough to ensure restaurants are sticking to health protocols. “We can see crowding at many establishments, especially at those located along the Pune-Nashik highway. Many customers ignore distancing rules. The situation needs to change,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/100-eateries-booked-but-pune-rural-residents-say-cops-missing-violations/articleshow/81620660.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Delhi||Parts of NCR likely to receive rain, thunderstorm today||NEW DELHI: Several parts of NCR are likely to receive rain, lightning, thunderstorm, and hailstorm on Monday under the influence of a western disturbance, according to the forecast of India Meteorological Department (IMD). A weatherman said Delhi might receive rain over the next three days, providing some much-needed relief from the soaring mercury. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said: “A western disturbance has affected the northern parts of Punjab on Sunday, while it will impact the NCR from Monday. There are chances of rain, lightning, and hailstorm during the day, while there is a possibility of very light rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.” The met department has predicted gusty winds, with a speed of 30-40 kmph, on Monday and Tuesday. IMD said when a western disturbance approaches a city, temperatures rise, however they can drop by 3-4 degrees after a spell of rain. “It will depend on how much it rains, but if the wind speed is high, temperatures may drop by a few degrees,” an official claimed. The maximum temperature on Sunday was 35.2 degrees Celsius, four notches above the normal, and the second highest day temperature to be reported this year. The highest maximum temperature of the year was recorded on March 18 at 35.3 degrees Celsius. “However, the mercury may drop to 32 degrees Celsius over the next three days due to rain,” said an official. The minimum temperature settled at 16.2 degrees Celsius on Sunday. The met department has predicted the mercury may record a steep rise from March 27, when the influence of the disturbance is likely to be over. The maximum temperature may touch 36 degrees Celsius on March 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/week-to-start-on-wet-note-temp-to-fall-a-bit/articleshow/81621476.cms||---

However, we will convey the message to the governor through our press conferences and public speeches. We will urge him to inform the Centre about the situation here. But no, we definitely won’t formally put forward any proposal to the governor directly.”From Sunday onwards, BJP has launched a statewide agitation to demand the resignation of home minister Anil Deshmukh over allegations made against him by IPS officer Parambir Singh.

---||Pune||Citizens allege local corporators helping people jump jab queues||Pune: Many citizens have expressed anger at what they said is mismanagement and preferential treatment at civic-run vaccination centres offering free Covid shots. Citizens alleged that officials at some centres were ignoring people who’ve pre-registered on CoWIN while allowing those recommended by local corporators to get ahead in the queue. A 53-year-old Kondhwa resident said despite pre-registration on the CoWIN app, she was handed a token at the site and asked to wait. “And even with the token system in place, a few political leaders have found a way to accommodate their friends in the queue. Those with the tokens were turned away,” she said. The token system has already come under fire for making vaccine beneficiaries wait for long hours. A health official said the system was put in place after specific time slots started filling up. “That’s why registered citizens are being given tokens at vaccination sites. Tokens are distributed in the morning and in the afternoon,” the official said. Citizens demanded the token be stopped and called for a more streamlined process for those who've pre-registered. “Local corporators seem to have tied-up with vaccination sites. They then call their people there. So, people arriving at the site after prior registration are either asked to come the next day or day after,” said M Dua, a senior citizen who recently visited a civic-run site after registering on CoWIN. A volunteer at a vaccination site said there is pressure to favour those who’ve taken help from local corporators to register. “It is a tie-up and wherever there are such practices, there will be chaos,” the volunteer, who did not want to be named, said. Authorities said all such complaints will be investigated. “All sites have been instructed to stick to procedure and ignore pressure,” said Rubal Agarwal, additional commissioner of the PMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-allege-local-corporators-helping-people-jump-jab-queues/articleshow/81620668.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Mango sellers hope for better sales than last year||Pune: Mango sellers that had set up temporary shops during the season last year, suffered heavy losses as the lockdown was announced and people were venturing out only to buy essential items. They hope sales won’t be affected this year, with the fear of another lockdown as Covid-19 cases continue to rise. “Sales of fresh produce is time sensitive. Unfortunately, last year as the mango season started, the lockdown was announced and people only wanted to spend money on essential items. We ended up selling our stock for less than half the price. Even then, over 20 to 30 dozens were unsold and ended up rotting. This year, the rates are back to what it would be normally — Rs1,200 per dozen for Alphonso — and the customers are also buying like they did before,” said Ahmed Nariwala, mango seller who sets up a stall in Kedari nagar. “It has been a week since I started my stall and I am already hopeful that this will be a good year. Many people missed satisfying their cravings for mangoes last year. Adapting to the new ways, we too have started offering home delivery like most mango sellers, who have put up stalls in the area,” said Pavan Thelekar, a mango seller in Salunke Vihar. He added that they were also offering home delivery now as they feared another lockdown, in the backdrop of the rising Covid-19 cases. While sales took a huge dip for most, profits were high for the sellers that managed to make their way into housing societies and set up stalls there. “Customers were willing to pay extra for the convenience and safety of getting access to buying fresh fruits and vegetables within the premises of their housing societies. From setting up stalls at farmers’ markets and one-off events, while also offering home deliveries, we adapted to contacting housing societies and setting up our stalls on their premises to offer our produce to their residents. Mangoes were in high demand. Every time we would run out of stock, we would take down the orders and deliver to the societies. This trend has carried on this year as well, as we have already received many orders for our specialty Ratnagiri Hapus from many residents of housing societies,” Shankar Mohite, an urban farmer, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mango-sellers-hope-for-better-sales-than-last-year/articleshow/81620716.cms||---

The outcome will decide if he retains his hold on the urban body or whether Dharmesh Saglani will take over. Presently, both factions have six members each in the 13-member council. The byelections for ward no. 9 in the Sakhali Municipal Council (SMC) recorded 87.67% voter turnout. Eight months ago, the Sawant-backed panel had formed the council but four months later one of the councillors from his panel, Damodar Gadi, passed away in November 2020. In 2018, when the election was held for SMC, the Saglani camp had formed the first council with nine of its councillors and the support of one independent. Later, two councillors from the Saglani group moved to the Sawant camp but the council was retained by the former. In few days, three more councillors moved to the Sawant camp and one from Sawant’s panel switched over. However, the Sawant-backed panel formed the council. Since November end, both sides have had six members each. While the ruling BJP group includes chairperson Yeshwant Madkar and councillors Brahma Desai, Shubhada Sawaikar, Anand Kanekar, Dayanand Boryekar and Rashmi, the opposition group includes deputy chairperson Ansira Khan, Jyoti Blaggaon, Raya Parsekar, Rajesh Sawal and Kunda Madkar besides Saglani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sakhali-municipal-byelection-results-crucial-for-sawant/articleshow/81621537.cms||---

---||Nagpur||District saw 22,578 cases in last 7 days, more than count of 10 months||NAGPUR: The district has registered 22,578 positive cases of Covid-19 in the third week of March (15-21), which is the highest tally for a week in the year-long pandemic. Cases registered in the last seven days are more than that detected in 28-31 days of all other months, excluding August and September last year. The biggest worry for the district is the test positivity rate (TPR) which has surged to 22%. TPR was 9.89% when the second started in the third week of February, followed by 8.46% in the last week. TRP increased to 12.43% in first week of March and increased to 18.63% in the second week. According to infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, such high number of cases might be due to mutation in variant of Covid-19. “Chances of UK variant (B.1.1.7) driving the transmission cannot be ruled out. Genome sequencing of swab samples can give the exact picture,” he said. TOI was the only paper to report on March 18 about the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, detecting the UK strain (B.1.1.7) in the swab sample of a 48-year-old woman from Wardha. It acknowledged the strain as a variant of concern. With no travel history, the woman had probably contracted the disease in the city. Citing this case, guardian minister Nitin Raut on Saturday had also feared mutation in strain. He said results of 92 swab samples sent for genome sequencing will help to know this. In the third week of March cases have increased three times as compared to the first week. Before the second wave, the highest number of cases in a day were 2,343 registered on September 13 last year. It was surpassed on March 16 (2,587). Since then, there have been more than 3,200 cases per day, with highest 3,796 detected on March 18. The district had registered peak of first wave in last two weeks of August and entire month of September last year. Highest number of 12,411 cases was in the second week of September. The increase is cases has also led to spike in the Covid toll in the third week of March. There have been 165 fatalities in the last seven days, which is three times that registered in the first week. The deaths are less as compared to September last year. Between September 15 and 21 last year, there were 392 fatalities, which is the highest for a week so far. Dr Shinde further said that the second wave is likely to be longer and bigger than first one. “Number of tests has increased and people too are less apprehensive about testing. There are large number of clusters this time. Unlike earlier, containment zone system may not work now because everything is open. Vaccination of all is must to tackle the situation,” he said. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Zilla Parishad (ZP) along with private laboratories have done record tests in the third week of March. In the last seven days 1,02,804 tests were done, which is a record for all weeks in the last 12 months. In second week of September, tests were 54,185. The district recorded second highest number of cases after Pune in the country for some days in the week gone by. Cases in city were probably highest among all urban areas in the country on two consecutive days. Active cases in the district surged to 29,771 on Sunday, which too is a record, and continued to be second after Pune (42,015) in active cases in the country. Raut in the meeting held on Sunday directed the NMC to conduct sample survey in hotspots to contain the Covid spread. “Identify reasons for spike in posh areas of Dharampeth, Laxmi Nagar and Hanuman Nagar zones. Antigen tests should be conducted in crowded areas and where there are high number of cases,” he said. The minister also stressed effective monitoring of positive patients in home isolation, followed by stringent action against violators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dist-saw-22578-cases-in-last-7-days-more-than-count-of-10-mths/articleshow/81620733.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Pune||War room for ambulance services||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is planning to set up a war room to manage ambulance services ferrying Covid patients. "We're planning it as a back-up measure. There has been no major spike in the number of emergency cases. But the war room will ensure ambulances are immediately available," said Kunal Khemnar, additional commissioner of PMC. He said the PMC will procure more ambulances if needed. Last year, it had sought more vehicles from the district administration. The PMC currently has 54 ambulances. Officials said that number can be upped to 125. But most new cases are asymptomatic and only few have needed hospitalisation. There are nearly 18,000 active patients in PMC limits. Nearly 70% are recovering at home. "Last year, the situation was worse. Some critical patients did lose their lives because they could not get timely help. So, this year, we're setting up a system to manage emergency vehicles and cases."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/war-room-for-ambulance-services/articleshow/81620687.cms||---
---||Pune||CoEP unit to reopen with 250 beds today||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation has decided to revive the jumbo Covid-19 care facility at the College of Engineering Pune (CoEP) from Monday. Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal said for the first phase, PMC has issued a work order for 250 beds to MedBros Healthcare Private Services, the agency which operated the facility earlier. This includes 125 oxygen beds, 100 isolation beds, and 25 ICU beds with ventilator support. “We will review the facility on Monday morning and if we feel it is ready to take in patients, then we will start admissions in the afternoon,” Agarwal said. Agarwal said they would increase the number of beds only as required. A dry run of oxygen supply was carried out at the facility on Sunday. “We were checking if the oxygen-carrying pipes and other medical equipment were functioning properly in Sunday’s dry run,” Agarwal said. “We have the necessary staff ready to resume services at the medical facility, but there are a few small things — pharmacy and medicinal stock, among others — that need to be taken care of,” MedBros director Sangram Kapale said. Kapale said they also have enough staff — from within and outside the state — should the need arise for the 800-bed facility to be operated at full capacity. Kapale said Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation too had approached the agency about its preparedness to operate the other jumbo unit, at Annasaheb Magar Stadium. “We gave them a readiness report. PCMC may make the facility operational sometime this week,” he said. Last week, Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil had said they were exploring the option to reactivate the jumbo facility soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/coep-unit-to-reopen-with-250-beds-today/articleshow/81620719.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Lucknow||UP assembly elections 2022: Sure of Muslim support, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav set to play Hindu card with temple visits||LUCKNOW: From visiting his favourite ‘Ghoda Chai’ joint to have a cup of steaming tea with college mates in his native place Etawah to inspecting incomplete developmental projects of his regime and spending a substantial time among saints in Banke Bihari temple in Mathura, national president of the Samajwadi Party, Akhilesh Yadav, has made his plans apparent for the 2022 Assembly elections. During the first leg of his pre-election month-long campaign, which completed on March 19 with a ‘kisan mahapanchayat’ along with his electoral ally RLD in Mathura, the way Akhilesh visited almost all major religious places he made it clear that he would sport the badge of the Hindu card as he is sure of the support of Muslims. During his first major mass contact programme in the past four years, also aimed at dispelling the impression that the he was not hitting the streets as his father and party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav used to, Akhilesh undertook extensive tours of almost half of the state (nearly 34 districts), addressed ‘karyakarta shivir’ (workers’ training camps) and visited most of the historical temples, including Kamadgiri in Chitrakoot, Vindhayachal Mandir in Mirzapur and Krishna temple at Vrindavan, Mathura. In the past one month since he left Lucknow to meet workers, Akhilesh’s main strategy was to revive and retain his direct connect with people. When he was in Etawah this week, Akhilesh had a stopover at a popular ‘Ghoda Chai’ joint, where among his friends, party workers and supporters he fondly recalled how he used to have tea in his childhood days at this shop. The former chief minister also stopped at a fruit-seller shop to enquire about his well-being.  During his first phase tour of the state -- largely focussed on western UP and the Braj region – Akhilesh did not forget to highlight a medical college lying unfinished in Budaun as well as dilapidated roads and bridges which need immediate repairs. During the second phase, which would begin after the panchayat polls, the SP chief would cover eastern and central UP. “If today UP has the maximum number of most polluted cities in the world it is because of the BJP government which has stalled work on bicycle tracks, dams and a riverfront project,” Akhilkesh said. In the next leg after the panchayat elections, the SP chief would hold workers’ training camps in Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Kanpur and Prayagraj mainly to push his pre-election campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sure-of-muslim-support-sp-chief-set-to-play-hindu-card-with-temple-visits/articleshow/81622053.cms||Subhash Mishra
---||Lucknow||Soccer suffers as UP Football Sangh mired in power play||LUCKNOW: After allegations of a jailed mafia controlling the UP Football Sangh, now the state soccer body is witnessing a tug of war between two politicians for control. Former MP Sanjay Sinh, who is now with the BJP, and Arvind Menon, national secretary of the party, have declared themselves as president of the UPFS which manages footballing activities and organise soccer tournaments in the state. Talking to TOI, JP Singh, a senior football player and functionary of the Super Sports Society, known for organising football tournaments in Lucknow, alleges that both the leaders have even refused to follow recommendations of an inquiry committee set up by chief minister Yogi Adityanath to look into affairs of the UPFS.  On a complaint of irregularities in the UPFS, the CM had ordered an inquiry by district magistrate and superintendent of police of Varanasi where UP Football Sangh is headquartered. Later, most of the complaints were found to be true and the registrar office had recommended derecognition of the UPFS.  It had also recommended creation of a new body to manage the state soccer scenario. However, by the time the inquiry report could be implemented, Menon, who is campaigning in West Bengal these days, got himself declared the president of the UPFS with most of the office-bearers of the UPFS shifting loyalty to him. As soon as Sinh came to know about this development he convened a meeting of his loyalists on March 20 and he too got himself declared as the president of the UPFS. A notice was also served on the Menon’s faction for not being a legal entity. Now, both Sinh and Menon are claiming to be the president of the association, while the football activities in the state have come to standstill. Earlier, addressing his loyalists at the meeting, Sinh said that he would try his best to streamline the functioning of the UP Football Sangh and the irregularities that had been committed in the past would be corrected. However, most of the football players are not ready to buy his theory. They said that when Sinh was president of the association he did not initiate steps against the office-bearers. Meanwhile, All-India Football Federation (AIFF) has called a meeting of the warring factions in Delhi on March 24 to resolve the raging dispute in UP football.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/soccer-suffers-as-upfs-mired-in-power-play/articleshow/81622081.cms||Subhash Mishra

They have now demanded that a first information (FIR) be lodged at Uran. “The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) has confirmed to us through a RTI reply that the landfill at Dhutum mangroves site has no coastal zone clearance. That is why we had complained to the authorities, leading to the recent field inspection by the state revenue department,” said B N Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation. MCZMA had earlier asked the Raigad district collectorate to check these green violations.The environmentalists had complained that a large tract of green mangroves in Dhutum, off the NH348 highway in Uran, were fully ‘buried’ in debris and earth, which is a green violation.“Revenue circle officer Sandeep Bhandare, who inspected the Dhutum area has also told us that the mangroves were destroyed at the site spread over two acres. As there is more than adequate proof of the environmental destruction, we are demanding that an FIR be lodged. It is gathered that a parking lot for heavy vehicles was to be illegally made over the mangroves,” said Kumar. —Vijay Singh||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiactivists-want-action-against-uran-wetland-destruction/articleshow/81622107.cms||---

Before the pandemic, my salary was around Rs12,000 and I made Rs5,000 every month from tips. Since I have come back to work, tips have become scarce. In the last three months, I have earned not more than Rs2,500 from tips. Moreover, my salary has decreased too,” said Kant.A group of waiters, who work at a bar and restaurant at Bibvewadi, said that tougher regulations on eateries have made things even more difficult. “We would earn Rs3,000 to Rs5,000, each month, from tips. When the restaurant reopened last November, tips started trickling in but suddenly they have dried out. For us, tips are very important as we can send that amount home. The restrictions have been tightened so not even 3% patrons are tipping waiters,” said Indrajeet Dhan, who hails from Jharkhand.Dilip Singh, who resumed work as a waiter at a family restaurant at Shivajinagar, said that he has been struggling. “The number of people coming to restaurants hasn’t been up to the mark and now things have got worse because of the restrictions. Earlier, there would be more than 30 customers tipping us. Now, there are days when no one spares any extra money,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tips-for-servers-at-restaurants-take-a-hit-as-early-deadline-kills-the-mood/articleshow/81620759.cms||Joy Sengupta

Anupam Kashyapi, head of IMD Pune’s forecast division, told TOI on Sunday, “There is interaction between different winds over north central Madhya Maharashtra, including Pune district. It has resulted in local instability. This is the main reason/cause behind the cloudy condition in the evening hours over the city. Due to this weather condition, the city will get very light spell of rain in the evening hours till March 24 with thunderstorms and lightning.” On Sunday, sunny condition was reported from the morning hours. After 3pm, it was cloudy with cold winds at some places. “Due to rainfall activities over Pune district and adjoining regions, the day temperature of the city has reduced a little bit,” the met official said. On Sunday, the Shivajinagar and Lohegaon observatories recorded 35.8°C and 34.9°C, which were below normal by 0.5 degree Celsius and above normal by 1.1 degree Celsius, respectively. “The day temperature of the city was likely to remain below 35°C, at least for the next three days. It would be a sort of respite for the people, from the scorching heat that they have been experiencing from the beginning of the month,” the met official added. The day temperatures in Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha regions have reduced between one to three degrees Celsius range on Sunday. “Some places in Marathwada and Vidarbha regions received hailstorm.

---||Delhi||Green mission: Govt to call in experts to discuss ways to improve Delhi’s air quality||NEW DELHI: With a recent ‘World Air Quality Report, 2020’ showing Delhi ranked as the 10th most polluted city and the top polluted capital city in the world, Delhi government’s environment department will soon conduct a conference with experts from academic institutes, environment related organisations and NGOs to discuss steps that can be taken to reduce air pollution. Government officials said they have been following a long-term action plan focused on hotspots, but now they will seek new suggestions. Track the pollution level in your cityA senior official with Delhi environment department said, “We have been following our action plan which was drafted after consultation with experts. However, after the recent report showed Delhi as the most polluted city in the world, we have decided to conduct a conference with all stakeholders inviting their suggestions on what else can be done for reducing the level of pollutants. We want to take views from all parties to see if anyone has anything new to add to our existing plan.” According to officials, beside experts from government departments, a list of 28 specialists from academic institutions, organisations and NGOs working in the field of environment has been compiled. Among the academic institutions, experts from Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, IIT-Bombay and IIT-Kanpur are expected to participate. While environmentalists and activists from The Energy and Resources Institute, Council for Policy Research, Climate Trends, World Resource Institute, Air Pollution Action Group, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, DEEKSHA and Growth Foundation of India are scheduled to join the meeting. According to the report, India’s capital with an average annual PM2.5 concentration at 84.1 micrograms per cubic metre topped the list of most polluted capital cities in the world. It was followed by Bangladesh’s Dhaka with annual average PM2.5 concentration at 77.1 micrograms per cubic metre. The report also stated that Delhi’s air quality improved by approximately 15% between 2019 and 2020. Commenting on the global report, Avinash Chanchal, Climate Campaigner at Greenpeace India had earlier said, “It is pertinent that both the central and the state governments prioritise sustainable and clean energy sources, as well as the cities, need to encourage low cost, active and carbon-neutral mobility choices such as walking, cycling and accessible public transport. Speeding up the transition to clean energy and clean transport not only saves lives but also dramatically reduces healthcare-related costs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/green-mission-govt-to-call-in-experts-to-discuss-ways-to-improve-citys-air-quality/articleshow/81621528.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Delhi||‘Dignity, grace’: Pratap Bhanu Mehta commends student ‘rebellion’ at Ashoka University||NEW DELHI: Addressing the students of Ashoka University as ‘Dear Superheroes’, Pratap Bhanu Mehta on Sunday said in a letter that “Ashoka as an institution stands indicted before your bracing moral clarity and deep political wisdom. Your protests instantly grasped what we, your elders, failed to adequately understand. Your protest was not about two individuals. It was Ashoka’s institutional integrity. It was also about the dark and ominous shadows that loom over Indian democracy.” “As many of you know, one of my favourite quotes is from George Eliot, ‘the right to rebellion is the right to seek a higher rule, and not to wander in mere lawlessness.’ Your rebellion was grounded in a concern for freedom and democracy. You carried it out with dignity, grace, and I might add, based on memes some of you shared, some serious artistic creativity,” Mehta wrote to Ashoka’s students who had on Saturday issued a two-day strike call to press for his reinstatement and said they’d lost their “trust and faith” in the administration to protect them from external political pressures. “So what can we, those who let you down, say to you? The first thing I will say is this. In all candour, this episode will be seen to have hurt Ashoka’s reputation. But in a larger sense Ashoka’s reputation will be enhanced, not by what the university did but what you did,” Mehta said. “I hope the trustees and faculty will work with you to secure your renewed trust and confidence. With your guidance they will be able the secure the institutional autonomy and freedom Ashoka needs. You embody the courage, reasonableness and understanding democratic values that will take the university forward.” “We live in complicated times. India is bursting with creativity. But the dark shadows of authoritarianism are also hovering over us, putting us all in often uncomfortable and sometimes dishonourable positions,” Mehta said. “We will have to find principled and intelligent ways of overcoming this condition. Most of us are reduced to lamenting this looming darkness. I leave Ashoka with the conviction that a young generation is emerging that will provide what Vivekananda said we needed. We don’t simply need people who cry darkness. We need someone who can shine the light. I am confident, all of you can and will.” Mehta said leaving Ashoka was not an easy decision for him but it was the “only honourable thing to do, consistent with my values; values I think you share. I also believe it is in the best interests of the university. It is often said that you cannot swim in the same river twice. In the contrarian spirit of Ashoka, I tried by resigning twice!! I hope even you might forgive me for not wanting to tempt fate again. The underlying circumstances that led to the resignation will not change for the foreseeable future, in my case, at any rate. So, I must close this chapter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dignity-grace-mehta-commends-student-rebellion-at-ashoka-univ/articleshow/81621540.cms||---

The langurs, according to the college authorities, were brought from Dornakal in Mahabubabad district to ward of other primates in the area, a practice illegal in itself because the langur is a protected species under the Schedule-II of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and capturing them carries a penalty of either a three-year jail term or a fine of Rs 20,000 or both. “We have benefitted immensely by keeping these langurs on the campus. We brought them from Dornakal after witnessing a similar practice at a railway station where at least five pairs of langurs were kept to ward off other primates. Although it is not correct to keep these animals tied, we were left with no other option after the monkeys attacked 15 students on the campus,” Chaitanya degree college registrar Rambabu said. College dean Prof S Kavita said they had to keep the langurs after every other attempt to keep the monkeys away had failed. “We have also tried bursting crackers and informed the municipal authorities, but nothing worked,” she said. The incident came to light after one of the students who went to the college, which is currently her examination center. “I was shocked to see these two langurs, a mother and her baby, tied to a tree with a short leash. On enquiry, I was told that they were brought here a few months ago to ward off other primates,” she said, on condition of anonymity. The two langurs were rescued after she reported the issue to animal activist A Goutham, who informed the forest department. “We will soon be releasing them back in the wild,” forest range officer Bikshapathi said, adding that they have simultaneously started an investigation and sent a notice to the college seeking their explanation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-grey-langurs-rescued-from-hanamkonda-college/articleshow/81622136.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Delhi||JNU plans to adopt common entrance test for admissions||NEW DELHI: Jawaharlal Nehru University is deliberating on becoming a part of the Central University Common Entrance Test from next year. This is one of the recommendations of the admission advisory committee mentioned in the agenda of the 157th academic council meeting scheduled for Monday. However, teachers said there were problems with such proposals for a university like JNU. Moushami Basu, secretary of JNU Teachers’ Association, said, “The administration will include it as a part of the larger policy and later say it has been passed. A discussion needs to be held for any exam of this sort.” “They say it can be done from next year. This is very problematic. We cannot go through with it because there are several unique centres in JNU that cannot have prescribed tests,” said another teacher. More than 20 JNU teachers have written to the administration seeking a discussion on the admission exams being conducted by National Testing Agency. “Our members have sent two letters, one relating to a review of the online format of MCQ-based examinations being held since 2019 and the other on the terms of reference of an agreement signed between NTA and JNU, financial costs, and other related aspects that have a bearing on the admissions policy,” said Basu. Questioning the power of vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar to hold meetings, JNUTA said, “The continuation of professor Kumar as the vice-chancellor on the order of the ministry of education is not an extension of his term and places him only in the position of an interim administrator. The understanding is that he will not indulge in exercising powers that are otherwise part of the official duties of a regular VC.” The VC couldn’t be reached for comment on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jnu-plans-to-adopt-common-entrance-test-for-admissions/articleshow/81629336.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Pune||Pune: Mercury rising, so masks being lowered, say offenders||PUNE: A formidable section of the face mask rule violators blames it on the rising heat for pulling the mandatory cover down for a breather and, eventually, paying the price for it. Police have intensified the drive to catch people venturing out without the face mask in the wake of the recent rise in the Covid-19 cases.  But many people rue that it’s not possible to move around with the face mask on in the sweltering heat. The day temperature in the city is hovering around the 36-37°C mark. Raja Chavan, an activist from Camp, said, “Breathing difficulty due to the increase in the temperature level is deterring many elderly from wearing the face masks. Some people are also complaining of suffocation if they wear the face cover. Police should sympathize with them, but not with the youngsters found flouting the rule.” Additional director general of police (retd) Rajendra Sonawane said, “Many citizens are found wearing the mask below the nose and pick up arguments with the police when caught. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) should set up a nuisance prevention squad and special police officers should be appointed to take strict action against the violators.” Aarti Sonagra, president of Nagar Road Citizens Forum, said, “Many government officials, including policemen, are seen without the face masks, hand gloves and face shields. It has become difficult for them to discharge duty due to the rise in temperature. Elected representatives, activists and NGOs are trying their best to sensitize people to follow Covid-19 norms. The government should intensify the inoculation drive to contain the spread the Covid-19.” City-based psychologist A K Singh said, “As the cases were reducing a month ago, many had a notion that the pandemic was over. They felt that if they got sick, it would be a regular cough and cold. There is also a feeling that since they have survived without being infected for this long, they will continue to be well.” City-based psychiatrist Swapnil Deshmukh has warned about a false sense of security among a section of the people that they might not contract the infection because they have been unaffected so far. Kalyaninagar resident Drayson Dixon said, “It is apparent that the citizens started dropping the guard over the past few months. But in light of the fresh resurgence in cases, it is important to remain vigilant and this calls for greater social responsibility. Wearing masks and maintaining social distancing are some of the main ways to reduce transmission of the virus.” (With inputs from Joy Sengupta & Swati Shinde Gole)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mercury-rising-so-masks-being-lowered-offenders/articleshow/81620786.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Lucknow||UP to buy ‘limitless’ wheat from farmers @ Rs 1,975/ quintal MSP||LUCKNOW: The UP government has rolled out a wheat procurement policy provisioning 'limitless' purchase of the rabi crop from the farmers at the stipulated minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,975 per quintal in 2021-22. The development comes amid a prolonged strike by farmers who have been expressing their apprehension about the government's intention of doing away with the MSP. “The purchase will be carried out till farmers continue to reach purchase centres to sell their produce,” the policy document issued by the food and civil supply department said. The wheat procurement would start from April 1 till June 15. The centres will continue to operate on all days between 9am and 6pm except Sundays and gazetted holidays. The period may, however, be altered by the respective district magistrates after considering local situations. The wheat procurement target in 2020-21 was 55 lakh metric tonnes. The actual purchase, however, was 35.76 lakh metric tonnes due to Covid-induced lockdown in the months of April-June. The procurement would be done through 6,000 centres, of which a maximum of 3,500 would be those operated by the Pradeshik Cooperative Federation (PCF). The marketing wing of the civil supply department would set up 1,100 centres, while UP Mandi Parishad, UP food and essential commodities corporation and UP Consumer Cooperative Sangh would operate 250 centres each. The Food Corporation of India will operate 150 centres. The purchase centres will be set up at the various tehsils and blocks in buildings of cooperative societies, mandi premises, Agricultural Marketing Hub, Rural Infrastructure Centres, Panchayat Bhawan, building of cane committees and fertilizer and seed selling centres.  The department can also set up purchase centres on rent on the main road for easy access to farmers. The centres would be geo-tagged to allow farmers to reach there easily. The policy empowers the food and civil supply department to add or remove the wheat procurement agencies. According to it, DMs would be the nodal officers overseeing procurement of wheat. The DM will have to appoint an additional DM-level officer as district purchase officer to monitor the procurement process. At the same time, a sub-divisional magistrate level officer will be required to supervise registration of farmers and oversee storage of wheat in coordination with the regional marketing officer. The district administration will also appoint a nodal officer at all the purchase centres to ensure purchase of wheat as per the designated rules and regulations. The nodal officer would subsequently be required to submit a report of purchase done with the district marketing officer on a daily basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-to-buy-limitless-wheat-from-farmers-rs-1975/-quintal-msp/articleshow/81622128.cms||Pankaj Shah

The CM's comments — confusing America with Britain — were made during an event to commemorate International Day of Forests at Ramnagar in Nainital during which he said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi saved India from the Covid-19 disaster and gave much needed relief to the people of the country.  "The situation would have been worse in case there was someone else in place of Modi as PM of the country," Rawat said, adding that the country was “in a much better situation compared to other countries like America which enslaved us for 200 years and which ruled the world once and it was said that the sun never used to set on its empire.” Rawat claimed that as many as 2.75 lakh people have died in America due to Covid-19, while according to official figures, half-a-million people (around 5.4 lakh) have lost their lives to the pandemic in the USA. There was more faux pas in his speech. “Italy, a country with a population of 12 crore, is at number one when it comes to health facilities, but lost more than 50 lakh citizens to the virus and is still in bad shape. It is heading towards another lockdown,” the CM said. Italy's population is 6.04 crore and its Covid-19 death toll is a little over 1 lakh currently. The CM also created a flutter with his remark that a family with more children gets more ration. The CM’s statements come on the back of his comments on women wearing “ripped jeans” which received flak from across the country.

As per the plan, the response time for the force to reach any spot in the state, in case of any emergency, would be less than five minutes. In addition to deploying more than 60% of the total available strength of the police force in the state on election duty, police would also hire the services of 25,000 special police officers, including 12,000 ex-Armymen and ex-NCC cadets. Services of student police cadets will also be utilized for queue management on the day of election. As many as 35,000 police officers and 5,200 supervisory officers — including assistant sub-inspectors, sub-inspectors, circle inspectors and deputy superintendents of police — will be directly deployed from the force for the elections. As many as 15,730 polling booths are being set up additionally in the state for the upcoming elections, taking the total number of polling booths in the state to 40,771. Top police sources said that every six to seven booths will be covered by a group patrolling team, and there would be five to six such teams in each police station. Every such team would comprise three civil police officers and an assistant sub-inspector. In addition, every police station will have a law and order patrolling team headed by an SI and another striking force headed by a station house officer (SHO). Apart from the eight teams in every police station, every sub-division will have another 10-member striking force headed by a DSP, who would all be armed. At the district level, there would be five striking forces — one each under the control of the district police chief, the range DIG, the zonal IG, ADGP (law and order) and the state police chief. Each of the officers will have one company of 72 policemen under them, which will be divided into eight teams of nine members each. In effect, there would be 40 such teams in each of the districts. “We will run a decoy test to check the effectiveness of the deployment on the previous day of elections, after all officials are deployed at their designated locations,” said additional director general of police (law and order) Vijay Sakhare. Personnel from the central armed police force (CAPF) will also be deployed. As many as 150 companies of CAPF are expected in the state. At present, 50 companies have reached the state and have been deployed in various districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/police-plan-elaborate-security-measures-for-assembly-polls/articleshow/81619924.cms||KP Saikiran

Dean of the hospital Rajendra Wabale said that around 10 staff members have tested positive since last month. “Most of the positive cases among these staffers are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Apart from that, even some doctors and staff nurses, who got the first dose, have tested positive since last month,” he said. The dean added that since the hospital has been treating non-Covid patients as well, the source of the infection and carrier identification is difficult, therefore exercising maximum precautions remains the only option. Another hospital official said that since the hospital is also treating non-Covid patients now, there is higher possibility that the coronavirus could spread because one cannot identify any person, who may be a carrier of the contagion. “At least when the hospital was deemed a dedicated Covid hospital, everyone knew that only Covid-related patients will be visiting the hospital. So, to reduce the positivity rate among hospital staff, the civic body should once again give YCMH dedicated a Covid hospital status,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/10-hospital-staff-members-at-ycm-test-ncov-positive/articleshow/81620795.cms||---

In the first two-and-a-half months of this year, the police have received 220 such complaints as against 140 cases recorded over the first three months of 2020. The modus operandi involves stealing or downloading photographs of victims. Later, creating an identical profile to send requests to the victims’ friends seeking money on the pretext that the victim has landed in a tough situation, said senior inspector Rajkumar Waghchaure of the cyber crime police. In some cases, the fraudsters used morphed photos of their victims on the fake profile and contacted the victims demanding money for deletion of such profiles, the police said. In other cases, fraudsters have even issued threats and abused friends of the victims just for fun. The officer added, “The suspects targeted only those profiles that allow anyone using social networking sites to see the photographs and other details of the profile owner.” “The suspect copies photographs, personal and professional details, which are generally uploaded on the social networking page. The fraudsters then create a fake profile using the same details of the victims. They also send friend requests to the victim’s friends, who accept the request without thinking too much,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cheating-blackmailing-through-fake-online-profiles-on-the-rise/articleshow/81620807.cms||---

Those with factories and commercial properties outside the municipal limits of Ludhiana (having an area of more than 500 square feet) have been served notices to pay institutional tax. Furious over the development, the businessmen claimed that this tax was another big burden put on them by the government and it could not have come at a worse time than this when they were already battling a huge rise in their expenditure. Some businessmen have approached the chief minister office, demanding abolition of the institutional tax with immediate effect.Upkar Singh Ahuja, president of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), said, “The state taxation department officials are sending notices to businessmen having factories and commercial establishments larger than 500 square feet outside municipal limits, asking them to pay institutional tax. The rate has been fixed at Re 1 per square feet. It might seem very less, but the problem is that almost every factory and commercial establishment located outside municipal limits is very large in size due to several factors like cheap price of land and so, this is a blow to us.”Ahuja added, “On one hand, the government advocates the need to decongest cities and on the other those who have set up large factories outside the municipal limits and brought prosperity to the underdeveloped areas are being punished with taxes. Such an action will discourage those industrialists who are thinking of establishing their units outside MC limits. Before issuing notices, the state taxation department should have at least thought about the tough circumstances the industry is facing.”Jagbir Singh Sokhi, president of Sewing Machine Development Club, said, “Large number of notices from the office of assistant commissioner of state tax have been issued. The industry is already passing through unprecedented times due to Covid-19 crisis and facing shortage of labour, skyrocketing prices of raw material, production loss, cancellation of domestic and international orders, and financial crunch. To top it all, the Covid-19 cases are again increasing. Therefore, the institutional tax notices should be taken back.”Pankaj Sharma, general secretary of CICU, said, “We have contacted the office of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, chief secretary Vini Mahajan, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and requested them to take notice of this issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bizmen-with-properties-outside-mc-limits-asked-to-pay-institutional-tax/articleshow/81619932.cms||---

He also said that karyakarta who win as independents would join the BJP panels. “We will win Mapusa, Mormugao, Sanguem, Quepem and Margao,” he said, adding that even if more than two MLAs join hands, BJP would still win Margao. Speaking to reporters, Tanavade said that after receiving information from local MLAs, he is confident of winning most wards. “All municipalities will have BJP chairpersons,” he said. He added that in some municipalities, BJP didn’t give the ticket to some karyakartas who then contested as independents. He also said that Panaji is a different case. “In Panaji, BJP supporters who were denied the ticket have gone and joined opposition and contested the election,” he said. “We have told the MLAs that even if BJP karyakartas contested as independents and get elected, they will join the BJP panel,” he said. Referring to BJP karyakartas supporting those from other party panels, Tanavade said that it is not right that BJP karyakartas join other parties to contest elections.

Though Supreme Court verdict handed over land to a Hindu party for construction of a temple in November 2019, Holi celebrations could not be held last year as the deity was still inside a tent. Celebrations this year will be marked by the euphoria of Ram temple construction, which has picked up pace after the new foundation blueprint was set rolling. Natural colours, special gulaal will be used in celebrations in court of Ram Lalla. The entire temple complex will be decorated with several variety of flowers, sourced from different parts of the country. The Ram Temple Trust has already begun discussions with priests on rituals scheduled for Holi. Talking to TOI, chief priest of Ramjanmabhoomi temple, Acharya Satyendra Das, said, “Ram Lalla stayed inside a temporary tent for three decades and was kept away from festivity. He will bless devotees this year after liberation of his birthplace.” “After Mughal king Babar’s commander Mir Baqi attacked the premises in 1528, Holi celebration was muted and limited to traditional rituals. Five hundred years later, we will celebrate the festival of colours at Ram Lalla’s court. A new era has begun,” said Dr Anil Mishra, member of temple Trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/holi-revelry-at-rjb-in-ayodhya-for-first-time/articleshow/81622176.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

There are many districts in India where schools are closed, whereas in some they are open with restrictions regarding age group of students and numbers. The new academic session starts either in April or June for majority of the states.Brainly, an online learning platform, said its survey revealed that 62.5% of respondents were comfortable with the new school unlocking norms. 21.1% of Indian students claimed that they were not sure of their feelings about the new guidelines. 16.4% of them were also apprehensive of the development. More than half of the overall survey respondents (51.4%) felt safe while going back to school in the new normal. The remaining students were split as they either considered it unsafe (25.5%) or hard to say (23.2%). Their opinion could be a part and parcel of their parents’ perception about reopening schools. 55.4% of the students said their parents were supportive of it while 26.3% of parents were concerned about their child’s safety.The survey further revealed that most of the students were optimistic and could adapt to the desired safety precautions. When asked if they will be able to adapt, 61.3% of the respondents said ‘yes’ while only 17.7% went with ‘no’. 21% of students deemed it was ‘hard to say’. Half of the students (52.1%) also claimed that they find remote schooling challenging in the current situation. However, 57.4% said that they would prefer a hybrid learning model with a mix of online and offline education after their schools reopen. Speaking on the survey findings, Rajesh Bysani, CPO at Brainly, said, “We have observed that a lot of Indian students have become active self-learners during the lockdown as they kept looking for solutions to their problems across online platforms. This increased access to learning resources has brought about a shift in their self-learning patterns while providing them more flexibility.”He added, “Going forth, the hybrid learning model will observe widespread adoption as online platforms add tangible value to a child’s educational needs, especially during after-school hours. The education will continue outside the classrooms as the students will be able to follow up on the classroom sessions and learn at their own pace.” The survey is based on a sample size of 3,397 respondents and gives a glimpse into students’ perceptions vis-à-vis relevant issues before the schools reopen this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/survey-62-students-comfortable-with-school-unlocking-norms/articleshow/81633005.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

About 95 deaths linked to floods and heatwave were reported in Andhra Pradesh. According to data from the Ministry of Earth Sciences, in 2019, of 2,503 deaths reported in India due to extreme weather events around 45 are from Andhra Pradesh and 85 are from Telangana. In 2020, out of 1740 deaths reported, 50 are from Andhra and 67 are from Telangana. As compared to 2019, the loss of life due to extreme weather events was less in 2020. India Meteorological Department in its report titled ‘Statement of Climate of India during 2020’ revealed the details of extreme weather events including heat, cold wave and rainfall events. In 2020, nine deaths were reported due to cyclones and 21 due to floods and 20 due to lightening making total to 50, in Andhra Pradesh. In 2019, 45 people died due to heat wave conditions. In 2019, floods killed 10 in Telangana and gale resulted in death of two people. Around 66 died of heat wave and 7 due to lightning strikes. In 2020, the Telangana floods claimed 61 lives and 6 died due to lightning strikes, taking the toll to 67. “It is observed that extreme events are all showing increasing trends in recent decades in line with other parts of the globe which is mainly attributed to climate change. As per the climate change projections made by IPCC, there is high probability for these extreme events to increase in coming years,” said Union minister of science and technology Harsha Vardhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-the-last-2-years-extreme-weather-events-killed-152-in-t/articleshow/81622161.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad PRL links cosmic dots from Japan to Rajasthan||AHMEDABAD: In 2017, a 4.5 billion year old piece of cosmic debris smashed into a Rajasthan village. This chunk from the heavens may provide a hint about the birth of the solar system. Ahmedabad-based Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) has found a connection between the Rajasthan meteorite which hit Mukundpura, near Jaipur, and the cosmic material retrieved by a Japanese mission. The meteorite was subsequently labelled Mukundpura-CM2. On December 5, 2020, carbonaceous material was recovered from the near-Earth asteroid Ryugu by the Japanese Hayabusa-2 mission. The operation involved intricate manoeuvres to gather dust from the moving asteroid. PRL has determined that Hayabusa-2’s yield has an analogue in Mukundpura-CM2. The Mukundpura meteorite is considered a part of asteroids that were formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Of approximately 60,000 meteorites held in official repositories around the world, only about 500 are like Mukundpura-CM2 — one of the most primitive meteorites. It is a remnant of the first solid bodies to form in the solar system. PRL scientists and associates have found that through its existence, Mukundpura-CM2 had experienced varying levels of reaction between its original minerals and water resulting in it collecting approximately 90% of its phyllosilicates.

High positivity rate among first contacts is being noticed again,” officials said. Meanwhile, the positive cases in schools continue to rise in the state. Forty-four students of Palamakula Residential School have been affected with the virus. Three days ago, officials had got students tested and 23 students were found to be infected.

---||Lucknow||Int’l shuttler & city lad to debut in Bollywood||Fazal Khan Lucknow: Focus, agility, grit and ability to take quick decision in the face of challenges are the traits of a perfect sportsperson. The same holds true for Lucknow lad and international badminton player, Eshan Naqvi, who maneuvered his way to the world of music and finally to the tinsel town after a nagging injury forced him out of the sports arena. Eshan, 29, is set to make his Bollywood debut opposite Parineeti Chopra in ‘Saina’, a biopic based on the life of ace shuttler Saina Nehwal, in which he plays the role of Parupalli Kashyap, a former badminton champion and Saina’s husband. The film will hit the screens on March 26. Born in Lucknow, Eshan comes from a family of sportspersons. His father, Ashher Naqvi, is a football and hockey veteran who has served as district sports officer (DSO) in Pilibhit and Lucknow and retired as regional sports officer, Gorakhpur. His elder sister, Parssa Naqvi, is also an international badminton player. “I was drawn to badminton since my childhood. In Pilibhit, where my father was posted as DSO, we had a badminton court next to our house where my elder sister used to play. I got inspired by her and started trying my hands at the game when I was around 8-9 years. Later, we moved to Lucknow and I played badminton at KD Singh Babu Stadium for 3-4 years,” he says. “I won state Under-13 championship, singles as well as doubles. Then I joined Thane Bandminton Academy where I trained under my coach Shrikant Vad. I came in contact with international players there who helped me grow. I won Under-16 and Under-19 state championships and became youngest Maharashtra state champion at 16,” Eshan adds. Internationally, Eshan has played Junior World Badminton Championship in Malaysia (2009) and Junior Asian Badminton Championship (2009). At senior level, he has represented India in India Open Grand Prix Gold Championship in Chennai (2010), Australian Gold Prix (2010) and participated in Croatia Open, Polish Open and Romanion International Tournament in 2012. However, a serious back injury forced him to hang his boots, but the setback made him stronger. “I was a performer since my childhood. I loved music, acting and mimicry. While I was taking rest and recovering from injury, I started pursuing music seriously,” says Eshan, whose song ‘Kajra mohabbat wala’ has garnered 3.5 million views on YouTube. So, how did Bollywood happen? “I met ‘Saina’ director Amol Gupte through my coach Shrikant Vad. I initially joined the project as a sports instructor to Parineeti and to help the team understand the intricacies of badminton. Later, I was selected for the role of P Kashyap after a few auditions and workshops,” he says. “There is no difference between sports and acting. I put my heart into whatever I do. Currently, I am focusing on acting and music,” he adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/intl-shuttler-city-lad-to-debut-in-bollywood/articleshow/81622193.cms||---

Patel had earlier served as its president. The 38-year-old woman has alleged that Patel used to call her and make obscene demands. Recently, he reached the woman’s house and molested her. She had initially not approached the police, but after Patel harassed her at her home, the family members encouraged her to register a case against him. Police are yet to arrest Patel. Meanwhile, on Sunday, BJP suspended Patel for his latest wrongdoing. In 2015, when Patel was serving as the president of the municipality, he fell into the anti-corruption bureau’s net for accepting a bribe of Rs 1 lakh. Even then the saffron party had asked him to resign as the president of the civic body and had suspended him. Ahead of the recent civic body polls, banners were placed against him in his ward when the party gave him a ticket despite objections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/savarkundla-bjp-councillor-molests-widow-booked/articleshow/81619963.cms||---

Two accused from Rajkot, Raj Korai and Pravin Shenajiya, were arrested for carrying out the robbery and their accomplice Rahul Parmar, who lives in Thangadh, was nabbed for passing information about the agent Mayur Rathod to the duo. On February 15, Rathod was intercepted by Korai and Shejaniya near Moldi village near Chotila when he was on his way to a bank to deposit the cash he had collected from three petrol pumps. The duo had followed him in a hatchback car without a registration plate. They snatched the bag containing the cash from Rathod at knifepoint and fled through internal roads to avoid CCTV cameras at toll plaza. However, while following Rathod, they were already captured in the cameras. “Initially, we did not find any leads as the car did not have a registration plate. Suspecting insider’s involvement, we started questioning people close to the victim,” said inspector Deepak Dhol of Surendranagar LCB. Since Parmar lives in the same neighbourhood as Rathod in Thangadh, he too was questioned and during interrogation, he confessed to the crime and revealed the names of the other two which led to their arrests. Police recovered Rs 12 lakh cash from Shejaniya and Rs 60,000 cash from Korai. An SUV purchased by them from the robbed money was also seized along with the hatchback car used for the crime. The trio also admitted to looting a biker of Rs 48,000 cash before robbing Rathod.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/trio-who-robbed-rs-21l-from-agent-held/articleshow/81619972.cms||---

IGGMCH dean Dr Ajay Keoliya said he was present in the ICU at the time of tripping, but the incident did not lead to any adverse impact on any patient. “The electrical team arrived and fixed the problem.

Armed with rubber gloves and large biodegradable plastic bags, he is ready at sharp 8am at the shore at Cacra. Aman patiently explains to a group of around nine youngsters aged between 11 and 20 how to go about picking the litter strewn around on this stretch of the coast and how to segregate the waste. During the pandemic, Aman, who lives nearby, began frequenting the Cacra shore for morning walks with his father. But as the days went by, he was aghast to see that the waste on the tiny sliver of beach kept piling up with each passing day. “I saw there were discarded fishing nets, broken bottles, plastic cups piling up here. I realised that I cannot expect my parents or the government to do something about this and that I have to be the change,” said Aman, a Class XI student at Woodstock International School, Mussoorie, who is currently pursuing education at home due to the pandemic. He then managed to rope eight to nine companions — cousins, friends and neighbours — for the task of a clean-up. And on the very first Sunday of the drive, the waste collected was beyond their imagination. The youngsters said they are determined to complete the task of clearing the entire stretch at Cacra of litter before the monsoon arrives and estimate that a clean-up on Sunday mornings will be required for over two months to finish the job. “We want to then move to other areas like Altinho, which is where some of the others in the group live. The message I want to send across to the youth is that they may not be able to clean the whole of Goa, but they can surely clean their own neighbourhoods,” said Aman, speaking with some urgency in his voice as he fears the monsoon will lead to the litter washing off into the sea. “I would urge other youth to hold similar clean-up drives in their neighbourhood,” said Vasundhara Dempo, 16, a school student. Aman has managed to arrange with the local panchayat to collect the segregated waste for processing and he has also initiated talks with the residents of the tiny settlement near the coast at Cacra about the harm littering can do to biodiversity. “Not just the locals, but a lot of people want to come here because it is a beautiful place. Unfortunately, they drive down here with food and alcohol and leave their waste behind. Not everyone litters, but enough people do it for it to be a problem,” said Aman. Aman’s cousin, Girija Dempo, 20, said the group is hoping that seeing a clean beach the visitors will stop littering. “When Aman told us, we thought it was an amazing initiative and it was even better that it is a collective effort getting the community and the youth together. Maybe other youth will look at us and take up similar initiatives,” said Girija, a psychology and neuroscience degree programme student. It is Aman’s mother Nivedita Dempo, who is helping the group with an added dose of motivation. “Every time he would come back from a walk I could see the angst in him seeing the litter. From childhood, he has always been told that if he wants something he has to learn to do it himself. When he thought of this initiative, I told him that he has to gain the support of other people who can help him,” said Nivedita. Aman is hoping that a few Sundays from now he will return to a cleaner coast at Cacra for his walks, rock and boulder climbing or simply to take in the beauty of the biodiversity of the place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aghast-at-piling-garbage-teenager-inspires-youngsters-to-keep-neighbourhoods-clean/articleshow/81621583.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

While Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) topped average per million cases with 20,451, Karimnagar district had the second-highest per million population cases at 18,951. Though Rangareddy and Medchal-Malkajgiri have high number of cumulative cases, Karimnagar had more cases per million population.

After reopening of schools and with residents not wearing masks, cases are increasing in Telangana like rest of the states, which is likely to continue till June.

The woman, 27, from the Isanpur area of the city, on Saturday filed a complaint with Khokhra police alleging that her husband abandoned her when she got Covid in April 2020. The woman, a nurse at LG Hospital in Maninagar, stated in her FIR that she married the Khokhra man on February 24, 2020. According to the FIR, the woman’s husband and in-laws began harassing her soon after marriage. The FIR said the woman’s husband and in-laws did not want her to work as a nurse. They said she might bring the infection home. She said one-and-a-half months after her marriage, Covid began to spread across the city. She said that she continued to attend to patients at the hospital and eventually got the disease herself. She alleged in the FIR that her husband told her then to bring Rs 10 lakh from her parents if she wanted to live with him. With the intervention of family members, she tried to strike a compromise. But her sister-in-law, also a nurse, told her to show a fresh Covid-negative report. But as the complainant refused to undergo any further test, her husband and inlaws told her to file for divorce. Her husband did not come back for her for about six months, so she approached police and filed a complaint over the dowry demand and harassment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nurse-gets-corona-husband-wants-rs-10l-to-take-her-back/articleshow/81622667.cms||---

Guardian minister Nitin Raut directed the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to initiate action against shops in case of violation of Covid-19 guidelines. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B has allowed 1+1 persons on two-wheelers, and 1+2 in three and four-wheelers from Monday onwards. Non-essential shops are allowed to open till 4pm, restaurants with 50% capacity and milk/dairy shops till 7pm. Kitchens of restaurants can operate for home delivery till 11pm. An order by collector Ravindra Thakare said wine shops can sell liquor over the counter till 4pm, but will be allowed home delivery till 10pm. Bars will be allowed to operate till 7pm, with 50% capacity, just like restaurants. There will be no restricted timings for emergency services including hospitals, medical shops etc, and essential services like petrol pumps, LPG gas agencies, wholesale vegetable, fruits markets, industries etc. Government (excluding essential works), semi-government offices and private offices will resume with 25% capacity. Libraries and reading rooms will continue with 50% capacity. A series of activities including educational institutions, gardens, weekly vegetable markets, gyms, sports activities etc will continue to remain shut till March 31. The civic chief said they will issue separate standard operating procedures for two days (March 28 and 29) for Holi festival. Collector will also issue a separate order for Holi. Raut said, “Markets have been allowed to open on the request of traders’ associations. All shopkeepers should follow Covid-19 guidelines to prevent further surge in cases.” NGO Together We Can has come up with a roadmap for shopkeepers to contain spread of the disease and enable continuation of business and economy. “Traders’ association should establish flying squads to monitor shops as well as customers. They should levy fine for not wearing mask, availability of sanitizers, and compliance of other guidelines. They should also take pictures of shops which continue violations and put in groups. Due to violations of few shops, threat of closure of markets is looming large,” the NGO said. The NGO added traders’ association should create awareness among shopkeepers to sell goods online. “They should also promote home delivery of goods. Association should felicitate shops which are properly following the guidelines,” NGO said. NMC’s nuisance detection squad (NDS) has continued levying and sealing shops for violation of timings and guidelines. The NDS will continue action on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/markets-restaurants-to-restart-with-limited-timings-today/articleshow/81620838.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

These were Bacillus thermocopriae and Brevibacillus borstenlensis. A team of scientists from Modern College of Arts, Science and Commerce, Pune, had collected soil samples from the impact pit within 48 hours. Scientists from Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) and California Institute of Technology, US, assisted in shockwave studies and analyzed the impact crater soil. The study found that Bacillus thermocopriae and Brevibacillus borstenlensis were present in the impact pit soil. The study happens to be the first report of its kind. The results were published in the Journal of Astrobiology of the Mary Ann Liebert Inc publication house recently.

But the operators of the clock are scared of the creaky flight of wooden stairs that lead to the mechanism. “They may break any moment. It feels unnerving climbing the stairs,” said a labourer engaged in the repairs. Even the Bhadra fort caretaker backs these apprehensions. The clock, installed in 1842, had been fitted with a new mechanism, including weights. In 2016, the clock had started functioning for the first time since its earlier breakdown in the 1960s. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had taken up the project in 2015 to revive the clock. The clock has two dials: the 7-foot dial faces Bhadra Plaza and the 4-foot dial faces Lal Darwaza. The ASI had called in the Navsari-based Percy Daruwala, one of the few experts of tower clocks in Gujarat, for the repairs. The authorities had initially found it difficult to identify a competent person to put a system in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/steps-to-abad-big-ben-ring-hollow/articleshow/81622643.cms||---

The remains were found on the ground between the seized vehicle parking lot that remained unattended for over two years now. A skull and bones of two legs were found from the spot, while its torso is missing. Police called the forensic science laboratory (FSL) team to examine the skeleton. FSL team collected samples to find out the exact reason behind death. “FSL will try to find out if the person is a male or a female. The forensic investigation may help to define the time of death,” said a police officer at Khatodara police station. Police and forensic experts are unsure that how much the skeletal remains can reveal since many other body parts are missing and the person believed to have died a long time ago. The police and forensic team could not judge the time of death from a preliminary examination of the remains. On Sunday, Khatodara police found the remains between rickshaws after they started shifting the seized vehicles that include two-wheelers and three-wheelers. As it is a big parking space, different police stations too park their seized vehicles at the Khatodara police station. “The vehicles had not been moved for over two years now. We wanted to arrange these in proper order and separate them as per police station when we discovered the skeletal remains. It is possible that the person may have gone inside the parking lot and died due to illness,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/skeletal-remains-found-from-khatodara-police-station-parking/articleshow/81619986.cms||---

These are among the 10 start-ups that will receive backing from Mumbai University’s incubation centre over the next two years. The incubator, called the MU Ideas Foundation, will be modelled on the lines of similar centres in premier institutes. While some of the initiatives have already been incubated, others are at pre-incubation stage. Biosensika Labs, one of the start-ups incubated at the university, has received Rs 41 lakh grant from the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) – Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) to work on a diagnostic kit for early detection of Covid-19. “When the idea was pitched, it was for TyphiCheck, which helps get rapid, quantitative, specific and highly sensitive results. During the pandemic we received funding for Covid diagnosis,” said Priyanka Sabherwal, founder CEO and a university faculty. “We develop innovative nanotechnology-based diagnostic solutions. Our strength is to develop unique receptors capable of showing high specificity by minimising false positive results,” said Sabherwal, adding the technology is versatile and can be extended to other infectious diseases too. Another start-up, Odin Hub, is looking to promote the concept of flipped classroom through recorded animated lectures by using voice-overs of teachers. Dr Nanoxa is an anti-microbial coating for surfaces which provides biosecurity from bacteria and viruses for up to 60 days. Samir Kulkarni, director, Incubation and Innovation Linkages, MU, said these nascent companies will be provided office space, lab facilities and mentoring at a nominal cost. “We will also help them file patents. The start-ups are expected to sign an agreement with the university,” said Kulkarni. The university’s Green Technology Building on the Kalina campus will house the incubation centre. While the centre was planned two years ago, work has only started recently. The state government has sanctioned Rs 5 crore, of which Rs 25 lakh has been disbursed.  “The centre will work on an equity sharing model, where the university will hold 3% equity shares if the start-ups are set up by a student, faculty or an alumnus and 4% in case of outsiders. We are hoping some of the start-ups eventually take off,” said pro-vice-chancellor, Ravindra Kulkarni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiten-start-ups-to-get-backing-from-mus-incubation-centre/articleshow/81622230.cms||Yogita Rao

Around 3,500 square metres in the complex is used by the company. Justice PV Asha issued the order after considering a petition by Kerala State Industrial Enterprises Ltd (KSIEL), a company owned by the state government that was established in 1973 when the integrated air cargo complex (IACC) was proposed to be established at Thiruvananthapuram, in tune with the central government’s policy decision to set up IACCs in each state. AAI had contended that it can provide concession only to government agencies directly or fully controlled by the government. The court pointed out that state government’s order (GO) of April 30, 1979 shows that KSIEL was appointed as the agency of the government for running the IACC. Citing a letter issued by AAI to KSIEL in July 2018, the court said in the judgment, “Thus the 50% concession was ordered for the land allotted to government agencies. That would mean that if the air cargo is under a government department, 50% concession would be available. In the present case, there is no separate claim for state government.” It is evident from the GO of 1979 that the petitioner is acting on behalf of the government of Kerala in implementation of the policy decision of the government of India to set up integrated cargo complexes, which could only be a public purpose. Therefore, whatever benefit is admissible to the government of Kerala should be granted to the petitioner, it said. Correspondence had been going on between the state and central governments regarding the enhanced rates, the court pointed out. “Though the respondents (AAI) have stated that govt agency means agency which is fully controlled by the government and that PSUs would not come within the said definition, nothing is seen in the orders to that effect. Therefore, to that extent, I am of the view that the matter requires reconsideration by the respondents.” Until a decision is taken, no coercive action should be taken against KSIEL, the court directed. KSIEL, which uses 3,505 square metres of unpaved land at the AICC, had also challenged the 2015 decision of AAI to increase land rent from Rs 243 per square metre to Rs 1,575 per year. However, the court said it is not going into the alleged arbitrariness at this stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/aai-told-to-rethink-rent-concession/articleshow/81619996.cms||---

There are reports of the demand going up by 30% to 50% in this month. The situation, however, is not the same as it was in September 2020. Much has changed since last year with lessons also learnt from the past, said sources in the industry. The sudden rise in cases then had also increased the demand for oxygen. This had left the industry in tight spot which could not cater to the requirement. However, this led to restarting some of the closed facilities as the existing capacity utilization was also enhanced by the gas manufactures to meet the demand. The same units which now continue to operate at an enhanced capacity have been able to meet the additional demand, said industrial sources. There has been a change in the approach by doctors. Earlier, majority of the patients were administered oxygen on being admitted. Now, only the critical cases are given oxygen. Despite this the demand has gone up. Dr Vikram Rathi, the consulting pulmonologist at Kingsway Hospitals, said, “There has been a change in the approach by doctors also. Earlier, higher oxygen was consumed as doctors tried to maintain a saturation level of 98 to 99 for the patient. However, in the last six months it was seen that it can help even if the oxygen level is kept close to 95. This has kept the requirement of medical oxygen under control.” Patients have begun reaching the hospital early which is preventing the cases from worsening. Early reporting also prevents oxygen consumption. Dr Anup Marar, the convenor of Vidarbha Hospitals Association, said, “There has been a change in entire approach by the doctors also. This has led to a judicial use of oxygen leading to a comfortable position despite demand going up.” Sources said even the rates of oxygen are stable due to adequate supply. “We are able to manage because demand has gone up around over 30% only. The industry may start feeling the pinch if it goes up further. There may not be a shortage soon after, but it can be a tight position if the additional demand goes up to over 65% of the earlier level,” said an official in one of the manufacturing units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/o2-demand-rises-but-hosps-manufacturers-not-gasping/articleshow/81620854.cms||Shishir Arya

The school buses have been out of use for the past one year due to the pandemic, providing bees an undisturbed place to set up hives, police said. It was three days ago that Brilliant Grammar School principal Srinivas contacted the victim, Mahadev (58), a labourer from Makthal, to clear the bus of bees. “Several mini-buses belonging to the institution have been parked in an open land next to the school. The buses were not in use for nearly a year due to the pandemic. Honey bees set up hives in one of the buses,” Makthal inspector Shankar said. And on Saturday evening, Mahadev arrived with his helper Gopi and they lit a raw coconut frond and placed it inside a bus. “Mahadev threw coconut fronds and even garbage on the floor of the bus thinking that the bees will leave fast. While the bees left the bus, the fire spread to the seats and Mahadev got trapped inside as the vehicle was engulfed in fire and thick smoke,” the inspector said. Mahadev collapsed inside the bus and Gopi fled from the spot as fire spread to two other buses. Alerted by locals, police rushed to the spot and using water controlled the fire before a fire tender reached the spot. After the fire was put out, the charred body of Mahadev was found in the bus. “We have registered a fire accident case under CrPC Section 174,” the inspector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/man-burnt-alive-in-bid-to-chase-bees-out-of-bus/articleshow/81622232.cms||---

Under the project, which was initiated in 2019, over 272 students from around 36 villages in the buffer have enrolled. Out of these, 74 have passed out with MS-CIT certification course,” said MS Reddy, APCCF & field director of Melghat. MTR is one of the largest and oldest tiger reserves of India and is geographically spread over 2,768 sqkm in four wildlife divisions. The core area consists of 1,500 sqkm and buffer zone 1,268 sqkm with many villages having infrastructural limitations. “The remoteness of villages adds to poverty leading to a higher rate of dropouts from schools causing unemployment among youth. This also subsequently increases their dependence on forests affecting the ecosystem. Hence, it becomes imperative to promote livelihood opportunities by providing these tribal communities skill development training,” says Reddy. “The computer learning centres at Harisal, Chikhaldara, Vastapur, and Shahnoor are run by Melghat Tiger Conservation Foundation (MTCF) imparts MS-CIT (Maharashtra State Certificate in Information Technology) courses. MS-CIT courses are important for government, semi-government, and private jobs and jobs as data entry operators. MTCF pays Rs 2,500 towards the fee of selected students,” said Praful Sawarkar, community development officer. Kalyani Lande, a computer trainer at Chikhaldara centre, says, “Those imparted training are from the economically weaker section. Some of them reach the centre walking 6km while others on bicycles. After completing the course they can apply as data entry operators in government and private firms. The course will also help them for further education and enhance skills in other sectors which are mostly going online. The certification has come in handy for these youth and they can earn somewhere near Rs 10,000 per month. After initial reluctance from parents, girls are now showing keen interest in learning.” Another instructor, Roshan Pandule at Harisal, says, “In 2019, Harisal was the first digital village and hence the centre was opened here first. It started with 38 students, all of them scored distinction. Now the flow is continuous. We have students from 14 villages and more than 50% are girls. Some of those passed out are working as data entry operators in private offices while others are self-employed.” Several pass outs said the computer course is an added advantage. “I’m a graduate. On basis of this certification I got a job in Nagpur but as my father passed away I left and returned to Harisal in November. Now I’m trying for a job in Amravati or Paratwada. My sister too has benefitted,” said Mamta Jagtap. Former honorary wildlife warden Vishal Bansod says there are over 50 in MTR. The increase in tiger numbers is due to the hard work of the field staff and conservation activities such as protection, livelihood management, research, awareness, and most importantly, voluntary resettlement of villages from the core area. “Unemployment among community affects the forest ecosystem through various anthropogenic activities. To overcome these challenges and reduce their dependency on forests and to involve them in protection and conservation, the computer learning and skill development training will prove an advantage,” Bansod said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/melghat-links-computer-training-skill-to-tiger-forest-conservation/articleshow/81620869.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Chandigarh||At martyrs’ rally, farmer unions flex youth muscles||BATHINDA: Farmer unions had a big show of youth strength at Sunam Udham Singh Wala town of Sangrur district on Sunday to prove that this segment had not alienated from the agitation. Girls formed a large part of the support. At this rally dedicated to freedom fighters Shaheeds Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev, and Udham Singh, the farmers pledged to continue fighting for a repeal of the central farm laws. The attending youth accused the central government of supporting “a British-like company rule” and threatened to besiege a private company’s dry port at Kila Raipur from March 27 to 31. The youngsters at this BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) and Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union rally claimed that 73 years on, the independence gained on August 15, 1947, seemed only “a transfer of power to neo-imperialists”. Claiming they’ll continue to attack the corporate interests, youth mobiliser Gurpreet Kaur Brass said: “We’ll march the basanti convoys of youngsters to the Delhi borders on the 90th martyrdom day of Shaheed Bhagat Singh on March 23.” ‘Inspired by Shaheed’Youth agitator Jagtar Singh Kalajhar said: “The martyrs’ path of sacrifice is our source of inspiration. The old imperialism has found local allies in feudal lords and capitalists. The central government brought the farm laws to push young farmers into deeper crisis and take away their land to encourage more suicides.” Farmer unionist Kala Singh Khunan Khurd claimed:“The farms laws will strengthen the control of corporate houses on the food system of the country and thrust labourers into the jaws of hunger. Already, the country has a dearth of food, while the corporates eye panchayat and shamlat lands.” ‘Boys to raid Delhi’Youth motivator Ajaypal Singh Ghudda said after laying siege to the dry port at Kila Raipur, “boys” will march to Delhi, while girls will pay tributes to martyrs at villages. He said: “To mobilise support for the March 26 Bharat Bandh, we’ll hold flag marches inside the villages on March 24 and 25.” Asked why youngsters were part of the protest, he said: “Because after farming, the government will privatise education.” Looking at the size of the gathering, BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri said: “Look, the youth and farmer unions have no difference of opinion. Youth are an important support to this struggle. Some forces are trying to label the movement a religious struggle but this congregation is a reply to their propaganda.” Harinder Kaur Bindu of the BKU women’s wing said: “We work towards realising Shaheed Bhagat Singh’s dream of a society free of exploitation, oppression, and discrimination. Women stand shoulder to shoulder with men in this fight.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/at-martyrs-rally-farmer-unions-flex-youth-muscles/articleshow/81620880.cms||Neel Kamal

The video shows a lion eating a live buffalo that is tied to a tree. The 30 seconds video raises serious question on how the Asiatic lions are being harassed with live baits for illegal shows. Some people in the background are heard speaking in a dialect that creates suspicion that the origin of the video may be from the village in and around Gir wildlife sanctuary, the last abode of the Asiatic lions in the world. Illegal lion show has been a huge menace in and around Gir forests and recently, nearly seven persons had been convicted by a local court for organising illegal lion show at a farm a few years ago by offering chicken as bait to a lioness.

Citizens can file complaints pertaining to information with the State Information Commission under Section 18 of the act, while they can file appeals either in departments concerned or with the commission under Section 19 of the act. According to information tabled by the state government in the ongoing budget session of the assembly, Gujarat Information Commission (GIC) received 8,176 appeals and complaints during 2019-20, almost 22% lesser than 2018-19 when it received 10,462 complaints and appeals. Those who have been using the RTI Act regularly say that this is a disturbing trend, and reflects growing disillusionment among RTI activists regarding the efficacy of the act. The bulk of appeals and complaints have been in just five departments of the state government — panchayat, rural housing and rural development, revenue, home, education, and roads and buildings. These five departments account for 72% of all complaints and appeals in 2019-20. “I have myself experienced this several times. We are not provided adequate information either from departments or in appeals. The reduction in number of complaints and appeals reflects a certain level of disenchantment among applicants,” said Mahesh Pandya, trustee, Mahiti Adhikar Gujarat Pahel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/22-dip-in-2019-20-in-rti-complaints-and-appeals/articleshow/81620908.cms||---

The Bowbazar police registered a case of cheating and fraud and started an investigation. Cops suspect that a skimming or shoulder surfing gang, which dupes people by inserting skimming machines at ATMs or replacing an original card with a fake one, might be involved with the fraud. The incident was reported days after a senior citizen, a resident of Park Street, was allegedly duped when he went to an ATM kiosk in the New Park Street area to withdraw money. Cops remain tight-lipped about the case, refusing to ascertain why someone from Bihar police would lodge the case unless there were leads that the gang was operating from the city.  “Following the complaint, it seems that the gang had fitted the skimming machine sometime in December at Darbhanga but withdrawn the money in Kolkata after three months,” said a police officer who was earlier deployed with the bank fraud section. Earlier, shoulder surfing incidents were reported from the Dhakuria, Lake and Naktala region before the accused fled from the city. “It seems that they are back here,” said the officer. A few days ago, an IAS officer was allegedly defrauded to the tune of Rs 18,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bihar-cop-loses-rs-40k-to-bank-fraud-in-kolkata/articleshow/81620900.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader and Kirti Kisan Union vice-president Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala addressed the mahapanchayat. He said the government was giving away farmlands to corporates, instead of farmers. “The development projects of PM Narendra Modi government may not have reached forest areas in mountains, but farmers protest has reached there as the peasants are organising themselves against the anti-people government, all across the country,” he said, adding that the killing of young farmer Navreet Singh should be seen as a message to Modi government that this protest was not limited to Punjab. Van Panchayat Sangharsh Samiti leader Tarun Joshi said the Modi government was trying to divide people on caste and religious lines, but the ongoing peasant movement had crushed this agenda. Kisan Sangharsh Samiti leader Deewar Kataria said the land settled by three generations of a family was being handed over to corporate houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/uttarakhands-1st-farm-rally-in-ramnagar/articleshow/81620901.cms||---

He was felicitated by the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM). Ranjit thanked all in his brief address and his only complaint was that there were less number of people, and he urged more people to join there. He was arrested on Janujary 29, when a violent mob attacked the Singhu morcha. Recalling the incidents of January 29, Ranjit has said he came out in self-defence when a mob attacked the morcha. Asked about the injury received by the SHO with his sword, for which he was booked by the police, Ranjit said, “I first waved the sword to scare away the violent mob as they were attacking the camp and the rioters retreated. I returned to the camp when I was pulled back by the police. I did not at all attack any police official or personnel and any injury to anybody would have been caused when they were pulling my sword in the melee. “Everything is clear from the videos that I did not attack anybody, rather I was thrashed by the police and people also joined them in beating me up,” he said, while speaking to TOI on Sunday. “When they bundled me in a police vehicle, even then I was hit with batons. I was struck on the head and forehead, and once just above my eye. After taking me to Alipore police station, cops told me to lie down with my face to the ground. Then they tied up my legs and rained lathis on my feet, scars of which could disappear in around a week. They wanted me to cry, but they failed. I kept reciting the Gurbani through the ordeal. Then I was taken to another police station where I was abused, things I can’t repeat. They were calling names to my religious identity and the protesting farmers. “However, there was a kind-hearted policeman who gave me a blanket when he saw me shivering in a T-shirt and kachhera (traditional Sikh shorts), as rest of my clothes were torn when police pulled me and thrashed me. Till next afternoon (January 30) that blanket was my only shield from cold. Before being taken to court, I was given a pyjama and an old coat. It was later in Tihar jail that DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa brought me some clothes. He had reached police station and then court, too,” Ranjit said. “In Tihar jail, I was punched in the back, where I had internal injuries from January 31. For a couple of days, jail staff would also taunt me, but then they stopped,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ranjit-rejoins-singhu-stir-felicitated-on-skm-stage/articleshow/81620897.cms||IP Singh

We are pushing it to 50,000 from the current daily average of 24,500 tests. The best way to control the spread is doubling testing and isolating positives.” Chahal said death rates were an equally important marker of the progression of the pandemic. “Today, (on Sunday) the death rate is 0.25%,” he said, adding that since 85% of the positive patients were asymptomatic, there was no shortage of public beds. On Sunday, ten deaths were recorded in the city after seven on Saturday. The city’s overall Covid-19 toll has reached 11,586, while the state’s cumulative fatalities have touched 53,399. Mumbai currently accounts for merely 12% of the cases being reported from Maharashtra. The state has been contributing over 62% of the country’s daily detections. Of the total cases on Sunday, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region reported the highest, 6,970. The Pune circle, which reported the second highest cases, saw the highest deaths (27). Whereas MMR saw 16 deaths, lower than Nagpur and Nashik that reported 21 and 17 fatalities, respectively. Out of the 99 deaths, 44 occurred in the last two days while the remaining were in the last few weeks. Within MMR, Kalyan- Dombivli on Sunday reported its second-highest jump of 651 coronavirus patients in the last 24 hours. Last year on July 12, the twin city had reported the highest, 661 Covid-19 cases. The death rate though has remained below 2%. On Sunday, only one death of a 90-year old patient from Dombivli was reported. A maximum 224 patients were reported from Kalyan. Expressing concern over the surge, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who on Friday had a meeting with Nashik’s district administration at Ozar airport, conceded that compared to the first wave, the second surge has become a more challenging task. The only relief was that 11,314 persons were discharged from various hospitals after recovery across the state, including 1,647 in Mumbai, taking the total to 22.14 lakh. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the recovery rate was 89.32%. It had reached 95% in January.

The action plan has been finalised as part of the roadmap for effective implementation of budget initiatives. Currently, no environment clearance is required to expand any existing linear project of up to 100km and also road projects which are built as bypass for urban areas. Sources said the action plan for “streamlining process of environment clearance” has been prepared as part of the overall plan to fast-track the budget announcements. The plan has been prepared following a webinar which PM Narendra Modi addressed to kick off the first-ever move to engage with all stakeholders to chalk out strategy for faster implementation of budget proposals. TOI has learnt that the road transport ministry has set a September 3 deadline for seeking this exemption from the environment and forests ministry. Similarly, to expedite public hearing, the ministry has proposed that this should be scheduled within 10 days of submission of documents from the user agency to state pollution control boards and in case of rescheduling due to lack of public participation, the environment ministry may mandate pathway to automatically set date of hearing within 10 days of original hearing and provide ‘deemed as approved’ after the second hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/to-widen-nhs-roads-ministry-seeks-to-skip-green-approvals/articleshow/81623547.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Coimbatore||Punjabi farmer campaigns for DMK in Tamil, takes electorate by surprise||Coimbatore: People gathered at Thirunal Nagar near Sundakkamuthur as part of the DMK election campaign on Sunday were pleasantly surprised when a Punjabi farmer spoke in fluent Tamil and sought votes for Karthikeya Sivasenathipathi, who is contesting from Thondamuthur assembly constituency.If you are wondering what’s the bond between the DMK candidate and the Punjabi farmer, Rajvindar Singh Golden, they made acquaintance in New Delhi during the farmers' protest against the new farm laws. And it was the Tamil language that connected them both. A resident of the city more than 20 years ago, Rajvindar said he had learned Tamil during his stay here. “When Sivasenathipathi and team visited New Delhi to support the farmers’ protest in December last, I was the only protesting farmer to speak Tamil and Tamil news channels interviewed me. Subsequently, I became a familiar face among the farmers here. Hence, I have come down here to support the DMK candidate.”Well, it doesn’t entirely seem to be his personal choice. His organization Azaad Kissan Sanghrash Committee had, in fact, asked him to campaign against the BJP, which brought in the “anti-farm” laws and its alliance partner AIADMK, which supported the same, in Tamil Nadu. “Our aim is to campaign against the BJP. In Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK government supported the BJP’s farm laws. So, I am campaigning against AIADMK also,” he said. Rajvindar requested the crowd gathered at Thirunal Nagar not to give any opportunities to the political parties that were working against the welfare of farmers. “The Union government has sold airports to the corporates and they will sell even Marina beach in Chennai. The DMK is supporting farmers and people should vote for the rising sun symbol.”Rajvindar said it was after the demise of his father that his entire family moved back to Amritsar in Punjab from the city. He is into agriculture, business and real estate in his hometown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/punjabi-farmer-campaigns-for-dmk-in-tamil-takes-electorate-by-surprise/articleshow/81620904.cms||A Subburaj
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: UK Covid variant may spread fast during summer, warn researchers||HYDERABAD: With Covid-19 cases gradually increasing in Hyderabad and parts of Telugu states, researchers warn that the UK variant (B117), which is already circulating here, is capable of spreading fast in warmer conditions. As the temperature will increase further as the summer advances, the UK variant may find the atmosphere more conducive for its spread. An international team of researchers has noticed that the UK variant, unlike other strains of the Covid-19, is not affected by a change in temperature. It is capable of hitting equally during winter and summer, but turning more active in warmer temperatures. On the other hand, other variants increase or decrease in their infection rates with the change in temperature, as city researchers had earlier found out. However, the UK variant is likely to be affected by rains in tropical areas like India. “Lineage B117 spreads with greater transmission in colder (conditions). However, we also find evidence of B117 having a transmission advantage at warmer temperatures compared to other strains... Our results suggest that for each degree Celsius rise in temperature, the ratio of UK strain, also called the variant of concern (VOC) to non-VOC infectivity may increase by about 0.12-0.22,” the researchers from the Imperial College London, UK, and Utah State University, USA, said in their study published in online preprint publication, MedRxiv. In other words, winter or summer conditions may not slow down the infection rate of the UK strain. The research study said adding that importantly in the context of new strains, transmission of respiratory viruses in tropical climates are often more sensitive to rainfall than temperature. “We additionally investigated whether the UK variant may respond differently to the environment as compared to non-UK variant strains. At warmer temperatures, the UK variant was even more transmissible than other strains than in colder conditions. This may be expected, as differences in fitness between strains are likely to be magnified in harsher environments where fitness is reduced overall,” the study said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uk-covid-variant-may-spread-fast-during-summer-warn-researchers/articleshow/81621632.cms||Syed Akbar

All earlier plans have been scrapped due to the rising cases of Covid. Many housing complexes held meetings over the weekend to decide whether playing with colours should be allowed or not. It was universally accept at these meetings that the residents of the complexes would shy away from playing with colours for their safety. To keep the festive spirit alive, some of the complexes will organise cultural programmes and distanced get-togethers over food, though children aged below 10 years and senior citizens will be kept away from these events. At Ruchira Residency, residents used to play with colours in every corner of the ground floor, from the garage to the swimming pool. This year, distanced gathering at only one spot will be allowed for a short while as the complex is going dry. “There will be no smearing of colour on each other as such contact can lead to the spread of the infection. We are awaiting some more instructions,” said a resident, Vijaylakshmi Kumar. Earlier, a grand Prabhat Pheri was planned at Upohar where residents would sing and go around the complex. But now this plan is being debated. “We will at the most burn the Holika. There will be no playing with colours this time. In our complex Holi is not only celebrated with community lunch but also with bhang and siddhi. Everything has been cancelled,” said Sudeep Ganguly, a spokesperson of the complex. Holika Dahan will also be done at Silver Spring, but there will be no use of colour inside the complex. “Our rain dance used to be very popular but we have scrapped it this time. People are sad as there would be no festivity during Holi. We may plan a cultural programme but the details are still being worked out,” said a member of the organising committee, Indranil Chowdhury. In some complexes like South City, alternatives to colour like ‘Phoolon ki Holi’ is being thought of, said spokesperson, Prasanta Banerjee. In other complexes like Siddha Pines, it was decided at the meeting on Sunday that there will be neither playing with colours nor any dining or cultural programme this time. “These events draw many people to one spot.” said the spokesperson, Manav Mehera Lakeview Housing complex cancelled playing with colour but there would be an arrangement for music and food. “People will have the choice of taking away parcels or sitting in a distanced manner to have lunch/dinner,” said secretary of the complex, Asim Dutta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/housing-complexes-in-city-take-covid-guard-say-no-to-playing-holi-this-year/articleshow/81620913.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

BKU (Charuni) state president Gurnam Singh Charuni attended the rally. Speakers said the agitation was for not only the farmers demanding the repeal of three farm laws, but also every section of society, as everyone would suffer if the laws came into force. Such mahapanchayats should be conducted at more villages to mobilise people. Charuni said, “We are being exploited by a handful of persons, but they can be replied if people from weaker sections come together. There are two laws in the nation, one for the weaker sections and one for the capitalists; if a person from weaker section fails to pay even a Rs 1-lakh debt, he is forced to commit suicide, but capitalists get relaxations.” He said the Narendra Modi government had “murdered democracy and time was not far when the nation would be divided in different states, debted to business groups”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/at-kaithal-charuni-calls-for-unity-among-weaker-sections/articleshow/81620909.cms||Vijender Kumar

The number is significantly less when compared to the number of industrialists who obtained loan in the previous years. In 2019-20, loans under these schemes were distributed to 369 people and in 2018-19, to 310 people, data shows.“Private finance companies demand a blank cheque when we approach them for loan. The interest rate depends on how bad we need money. If we need it immediately, they would even charge Rs 10 for every Rs 100, which is several times higher than the bank rate. We have no other option but to borrow from them as we have to pay salary to workers, electricity bill and building rent,” a foundry owner told TOI.“When some businessmen failed to pay the interest due to the coronavirus impact, the financiers threatened them, visited their houses, humiliated them and filled a huge amount in the blank cheque and deposited it in the bank. They would file cheque bounce case against us to ruin our lives,” he added. Another businessman said that the finance company from where he borrowed money has been demanding double the interest. “My business is in loss due to the sharp increase in raw material prices. In this situation, how will I pay the huge interest? I would not have been pushed to this situation if banks had sanctioned loan,” he said.A businessman, who is making engineering components, said he had applied for a bank loan after the Covid crisis. “I am yet to get it. Bank authorities told me that as my company’s turnover is 50% lesser in 2020 than in 2019, it is difficult to process the application. In 2020, all companies were shut for three months due to the lockdown. It took me some months to pick up the pace due to manpower shortage.”Unable to bear the humiliation meted out by private financiers, several businessmen shut shops and some took their own life, said J James, president of the Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises. “The government should take steps to ensure that banks provide us loans and streamline private finance companies,” he said.Meanwhile, a private bank manager said that they have been sanctioning only collateral loans. “We would not be able to bear the loss if they fail to repay. Bank managers are wary because sanctioning collateral-less loans would put their career at risk if borrower fails to repay,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/usury-squeezes-life-out-of-small-bizmen-as-banks-turn-blind-eye/articleshow/81620911.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Several pharmacies ran out of stocks. But when the cases dropped, the sales also dropped significantly. Mask sales came down by 75% in February compared to the same period last year, said Annam Thirunavukkarasu, secretary of the Coimbatore District Chemists and Druggists Association. “But as cases are rising again, sales have gone up by 30%. We have increased the stock by 50% as cases are likely to go up further. Surgical masks are sold in large numbers. We are also educating the public about using masks,” he said.Pharmacists used to sell more than 100 sanitizers a day last year, said K Manimozhi, a pharmacist. “But the sales dropped by 90% after the lockdown was relaxed, mainly because sanitizers are being provided at almost all public places. In the last couple of months, people have started asking for it again and sales have gone up by 10%,” she said.The city corporation and police have again started penalizing people for not wearing masks in public places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mask-sales-go-up-by-30-as-covid-19-cases-surge-again/articleshow/81620914.cms||Nivedha Selvam

These groups in association with the civic body are organising vaccination camps for their community members. On Sunday, Rana community organised a vaccination camp for their members at Sikotra Mata Vadi in the city where 237 were vaccinated. “I call upon everybody to get vaccinated as soon as possible and join the fight against Covid-19. It's safe,” said Kailashgiri Goswami, 58, Sikotra Mata temple priest. MLA and a member of the Rana community, Arvind Rana visited the vaccination camp and urged people to take the jab. “I came here to take vaccination and ensure that we make the city safe against Covid-19,” said 57-year-old school principal Champakali Jairwala, a resident of Athwalines. At another such camp organised by MLA Arvind Rana in his constituency (Surat East), a total of 184 people were given vaccination at Rustampura in the city. “Covid-19 vaccination is safe and it's Swadeshi. If we want to keep the virus under check, we must take vaccination,” said Kanji Bhalala, president of Shree Saurashtra Patel Sewa Samaj, who along with his wife Jayshree, took vaccination shots on Sunday. A vaccination Centre was started at Diamond hospital on Saturday. At present, there are over 115 vaccination centres across the city.

The team events have been added for the first time in the rifle-pistol category of the World Cup cycle. The Indian trio shot 16 points in the gold medal round to finish way ahead of the Poland team comprising Julita Borek, Joanna Iwona Wawrzonowska and Agnieszka Korejwo, who managed to get 8 points. “We were in good form right from the qualification rounds where we aggregated 1,731 in the first qualification followed by 576 in the second. Shooting alongside Manu and Yashaswini was fun as we were in sync throughout the competition. Having known the two for long, there was a comfort factor as well and that worked out well,” Nivetha told TOI. This is her maiden senior World Cup medal. The 25-year-old had narrowly missed out on bronze in the women’s 10m air pistol event on Saturday as she finished fourth. “In the individual event, I came so close but failed to make a podium finish, which was disappointing. But I didn’t want to hold on to that thought for long as I had the team event. A gold medal in the team event is satisfying,” she said. Even as her teammates were finding ways to keep themselves associated with the sport during the Covid-induced lockdown last year, Nivetha chose to do otherwise. “I took a complete break from shooting from March till almost November last year. I did the basic training to stay fit, but I didn’t shoot at all during that period,” she revealed. She spent time cooking and even helping her father. “My father has a pump business and I began going to the office for the first time during that time. It was great to even learn cooking,” she said. “After training and shooting for many years, I felt some time away from the sport would be good. And it worked out well as I came back fresh,” Nivetha said. She performed well during the selection trials in January and made it to the Indian team for the World Cup.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-based-shooter-wins-gold-in-issf-world-cup-team-event/articleshow/81620918.cms||Prasad RS

City-based experts busted some of the myths around the topic and said that the condition is passed from parents to children in only 10% cases. Dr Jayesh Sheth, director of city-based IHG, said that Down Syndrome is a common genetic disorders found in one in 800 live childbirths. “Our studies point at the transfer of genes from parents to children in just 10% cases – it means that in 90%cases, it’s not a specific genetic factor but a random anomaly,” he said. Experts said that deficiency of vitamin B12 and B9 (folate) can be one of the contributing factors, if not the primary reason. Addressing the deficiency can reduce the chances, they added. “One of the misconceptions about the condition is – the child has mental retardation. It’s not true. We term it sub-normal mental growth that causes delayed development. Timely interventions and training the children properly can significantly improve their conditions,” said Dr Sheth. Several city-based organizations working with the mental health and disabilities offer assistance and rehabilitation services, said experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/inherited-only-in-10-cases-vitamin-deficiency-a-factor/articleshow/81620924.cms||---

Prepared for Rs 5 lakh, the trolley has the facility of a kitchen, washroom, bed, and sofa set. Gurbir (52) left Kotkapura on Sunday to join farmers on the borders of Delhi and took the trolley by towing it behind his all-terrain SUV. Belonging to Kotkapura, Gurbir is a law graduate, but also farms on the family-owned 80 acres. Mechanic Jassa Singh took 25 days to prepare the trolley. “As the farmer struggle is expected to stretch on for long and going by the fast approaching summer season, I decided to prepare a trolley where we could stay on in a comfortable atmosphere. “Sometimes, the family too accompanies us to the protest, so I ensured that the trolley has five-star facilities,” Gurbir told TOI on Sunday evening, when he was on the way to Delhi border. To justify the upgrade to his trolley, he quipped: “Punjabia de shok vakhrey (Punjabis have eclectic tastes).” “I will stay at the protest for long, but the central government must repeal the farm laws, so farmers could return home and take care of their crops,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rs-5l-on-trolley-upgrade-for-protest/articleshow/81620921.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Nagpur||No action on report about corruption: Fadnavis||Nagpur: The political slugfest over corruption in Maharashtra police took a curious turn on Sunday when leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis charged the state government with sitting over a report prepared by former state DGP Subodh Jaiswal on malpractices within the force. He added that NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s remark — in New Delhi on Sunday — on Sachin Waze’s reinstatement done at the behest of former DGP Parambir Singh is “half-truth” and demanded a court-appointed panel to probe this. Former chief minister Fadnavis reiterated his demand that home minister Anil Deshmukh must resign in the alleged “Rs100 crore a month” collection case. “Singh’s letter (released on Saturday accusing Deshmukh of asking cops to collect money) is not the first instance of corruption allegations within the force. The same thing about collecting money, cash for transfer etc were also mentioned in the report submitted by Jaiswal. It was sent to the chief minister but no action has been taken,” said Fadnavis, adding that the report also mentions how certain power brokers were embedded in the system. Jaiswal, before going for central deputation in November 2020, had submitted the report to the chief minister’s office with evidence on “involvement of certain officers in the malpractices”. “The report also talks about power brokers working closely with certain members of the MVA government. Some within the home minister’s office, using his name, are indulging in all these things,” said Fadnavis. The BJP neta said that Jaiswal’s report was prepared following a detailed investigation. “These malpractices were brought to Jaiswal’s notice by the then intelligence department chief Rashmi Shukla. He then sought, and received, permission to place phones of certain people under surveillance. Based on these interceptions, a big racket came to the fore which involved corruption and cash for transfers/postings. All these evidences were mentioned in the report,” Fadnavis said, adding that now both Jaiswal and Shukla had gone on central deputation. Fadnavis said he only partly agrees with Pawar’s statement regarding Waze’s reinstatement in the force. “It is true that Waze was brought back by the appellate committee which was headed by Parambir Singh. But, now, Pawar must also accept that all this was done on the instructions of the HM and CM. Waze started getting the most important cases soon after he was reinstated. Without (political) blessings, this cannot happen. Investigation must be done about who were using the cars found in Waze’s possession,” he said. While demanding an inquiry into the allegations made in Singh’s letter about “Rs100 crore a month collection”, Fadnavis said it has to be done in a fair manner. “Pawar says former top cop Julio Ribeiro must do it. But can a retired DG head an inquiry against a sitting HM? Ideally, it should be a central agency. But, if I suggest that, the MVA will accuse me of playing politics. So, the best option is to have a court-appointed committee for this,” he added. Emphasising that Deshmukh must resign first, Fadnavis said, “Many are wondering who is running the home department because now Shiv Sena’s Anil Parab is answering queries related to the home department.” On BJP pushing for President’s rule in the state, Fadnavis said, “Our state president Chandrakant Patil will take up this issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-action-on-report-about-corruption-fadnavis/articleshow/81620919.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The paper for C-SAT was of a higher difficulty level, the candidates said. Resident deputy collector Jayashree Katare told TOI, “Three candidates in Pune district reported positive for Covid-19 and they were allowed to attempt the exam wearing PPE kits and in a separate seating arrangement.”The exam, which was to be conducted on March 14, was postponed by the commission just two days before it was to start. Candidates across Maharashtra staged a protest and the revised date was set for March 21. The exam was conducted for nearly 200 vacancies. There was a registration of 2.6 lakh candidates from Maharashtra. In Pune, about 31,000 applications were registered and 24,202 candidates appeared on Sunday, as per the district administration.The candidates were allowed to enter the exam hall 90 minutes before the scheduled time.

---||Hyderabad||As masks slip, Telangana sees surge in Covid cases||HYDERABAD: Global experts have said that wearing masks in the streets and mass gathering can be the most effective way of controlling the surge of the novel coronavirus, but its exactly the opposite in Hyderabad with poor enforcement by the police and civic authorities. The non-compliance of residents regarding the mandatory rule of wearing a mask, despite a sharp rise in coronavirus cases, is rampant in various parts of the city. Though the task of enforcement has been given to police and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), but it’s not been implemented at all in recent months, which, according to experts is one of the main reasons for the virus spreading rapidly in the city for the second time since the outbreak last March. Whether it is at bus stations, railway stations and other public places, especially where there are large gatherings, there have been rampant violations of not wearing masks. This trend is no different on roads, where people are walking without wearing masks. “Only when there is compulsion and strict enforcement for wearing the mask, we can save people from coronavirus. For bringing the sense of fear, government should impose heavy penalties,” Hon. Secretary, IMA academy of medical specialists, Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav told TOI. “The worst part is that educated people are also widely not using masks. If need be, there is a need to punish the violators by placing them under mandatory quarantine or taking other similar measures,” Dr Yadav said. People who travel in public transport are comparatively more vulnerable to contracting the virus. At Secunderabad railway station, it was observed that there is no regulation on the entry and exit of people. However, at Kachiguda railway station only bonafide passengers are being allowed into the station. In fact, there is no enforcement mechanism at the railway stations or inside the train, to ensure whether the passengers or the pantry staff are wearing the mask. However, police in city claim that enforcement is being done by registration of e-petty cases. When Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar was contacted to know why enforcement is not being done, he told TOI that police are taking up initiatives to create awareness and wherever possible, cases are also being registered. Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat said that e-petty cases are being registered. “Wearing of mask is mandatory even for people who have taken second dose of vaccine. It is only after 15 days one can get full immunity. Till then social distancing, mask and sanitisation (SMS) is mandatory,” he said. The state government, following the lockdown in 2020, had decided to levy Rs 1,000 fine for not wearing mask, but privately cops admit they are letting everyone go with a warning. “Until everyone is vaccinated, everyone should wear a mask as now, masks are the real vaccine. There should also be enforcement by proper enforcement by law-enforcing agencies,” said Dr P Avinash, family physician. “I have seen patients arguing that there were not questioned on the road, so why am I so worried,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/residents-stop-wearing-masks-cops-say-e-petty-cases-being-filed/articleshow/81621638.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Backed by AIADMK, BJP to give tough fight to Cong in Ooty||In a first, Ooty constituency will witness a direct fight between the Congress and the BJP. Traditionally a Congress bastion, the seat would see a tough competition this time.While the Congress has fielded the sitting MLA R Ganesh, the BJP has pitted Hittakkal M Bhojarajan, a former sympathiser of the grand old party, against him after dilly dallying for more than a week. For Bhojarajan, it’s a golden opportunity to pay back the Congress for denying him a seat 40 years ago after nominating him from the Nilgiris parliamentary constituency for the 1980 Lok Sabha election. He had a disgraceful exit after the Congress replaced him with R Prabhu, who was brought in from Coimbatore, at the eleventh hour. He hasn’t been active in politics since then. He had, however, joined the saffron party in 2014. A planter from Kotagiri taluk, Bhojarajan was handpicked by the BJP just two days ago to represent the party from Ooty constituency, the most watched out among the three assembly segments in the Nilgiris. He has carved out a niche for himself among the locals with his philanthropy activities over the past 40 years. His close association with the tea industry and involvement to address the plight of small tea farmers and tea factory owners are likely to work to his advantage.While the BJP had unsuccessfully contested from the Ooty constituency independently in the past two assembly elections, one has to wait and see whether the alliance with the ruling AIADMK would make any difference this time.Given that the constituency usually favours only candidates from the Badaga community, the BJP seems to have made a wrong pick though. Bhojarajan is the only candidate not representing the Badaga community in the segment.Both the Amma Makkal Munnettra Kazhagam (AMMK) and the Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) have also fielded their candidates from the constituency, which houses 160 Badaga villages. Like the Congress, they too have put faith in the Badaga community and selected a candidate from the community. As such, Badaga votes are likely to split. While the AMMK has fielded Denadu T.Lakshmanan, the MNM has roped in Dr S Suresh Babu to contest from the segment. The Congress-DMK alliance had polled 67,747 votes in the 2016 election, while the BJP could secure only 5,818 votes. It is to be noted that the BJP had polled just 2,716 votes in the 2011 election. However, with the backing of the AIADMK, the BJP might give the Congress-DMK alliance a tough fight this year. While the ruling party enjoys more than 50,000 votes in the constituency, the AMMK is likely to eat into its vote bank. Ganesh said he was confident of retaining the seat. “I have done many things to the constituency right from renovation of Ooty bus stand to developing a parking lot. I will strive hard to get a minimum support price for green leaf tea for small tea farmers here.”Key issues that the constituency face include lack of jobs, bad roads and fluctuating tea prices, which has stalled the growth of tea industry. Tourism is the only real job generator. Minimum support price for green leaf tea has been a long pending demand of the small tea farmers here.Another issue is lack of land regulation rules, as a result of which huge tracts of agricultural land has been converted into real estate. And, most of the areas in Ooty town lack proper drainage system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/backed-by-aiadmk-bjp-to-give-tough-fight-to-cong-in-ooty/articleshow/81620922.cms||---

The new members are expected to give a boost to the park, which lost a big cat last year. The animals will be kept in quarantine for a period of three weeks and will be monitored before they are introduced to the public. The forest team led by senior veterinarian Arvind Mathur had reached Odisha last week. Talking about the journey, Mathur said, “We left from Odisha on March 17 and the journey took us five days as we moved very slowly and stopped every two hours to ensure that the animals are comfortable. We provided them with natural environment in the special containers and they were given mineral water at regular halts.” In an exchange programme, the state forest department will send alligators, wolves, Chinkara and leopards to Odisha. Recently, the Nahargarh Biological Park had come into limelight for deaths of wild cats. In August, after 15-year-old white tiger Raja died, the park was left with no white tiger. Similarly, another white tigress Sita died last year. “The animals were brought as we had lost white tigers last year and the other big cats are older in age. The new animals will be quarantined for 21 days and segregated from the other animals at the park till then. We are hopeful that the new big cats will mate thereby giving a boost to the big cat population at the park”, added Mathur||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nahargarh-biological-park-gets-new-arrivals/articleshow/81620941.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Tool helps improve pedestrian safety||HYDERABAD: A civil engineering teacher from the city has analysed accident data at 10 busy locations and came up with an assessment tool to improve pedestrian safety. A study, conducted by Bandhan Bandhu Majumdar, an assistant professor, Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, and his team, developed sidewalks and crosswalks condition index (SCI/CCI). They suggested measures such as the provision of exclusive right-of-way to pedestrians, maintaining sidewalk quality, enforcing no jaywalking, re-designing of signal timing with pedestrian phase, provision of the zebra-crossing and refuge island would improve the walkability at pedestrian crash-prone locations across Hyderabad. “The main contribution of this study is the demonstration of a framework for pedestrian infrastructure evaluation,” said Majumdar, who is the principal investigator of the study, which was accepted by ‘Transportation Research Record’, an international journal. He said they have taken accident data of three years—2015-19, from the city police, visited the areas to know ground reality, conducted a survey with researchers and industry experts to come up with the SCI/CCI index. Bowenpally, Kharkhana, Banjara Hills, Langar Houz, Mehdipatnam, Begumpet, among others, with the highest pedestrian fatality, were selected as study locations by the researchers. The SCI/CCI index attributes were used to assess the existing conditions and infrastructural requirements. “Results indicated that sidewalk attributes such as sidewalk lighting, cleanliness, physical separation of traffic, and traffic speed and crosswalk attributes such as conflicts with crossing traffic, crosswalk illumination, and intersection control influence safety and walkability significantly,” he added. Majumdar said that their study revealed that sidewalk/crosswalk at Mehdipatnam were in best walkability condition and Langar Houz was the worst.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tool-helps-improve-pedestrian-safety/articleshow/81621646.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Police suspect Kalaivani of Thanikachalam Nagar was strangled by her newly appointed security guard Rakesh. Four gold bangles, a 15-sovereign mangalsutra and Rs 10,000 in cash were missing from the house. Kalaivani’s husband Ravi runs a chit fund in Sowcarpet and her son Umesh is working in Pune. Rakesh had approached the couple on March 15, saying he was a house painter but was willing to do any work as the lockdown had hit hard. Ravi appointed him as a security guard at his home and gave him a room to stay on the ground floor. Rakesh then moved in with his wife and two children. On Saturday evening, Ravi tried to contact his wife from his workplace. When she did not pick up his calls, Ravi alerted his relatives to check. But Ravi himself reached home before anyone else and broke open the door around 11.30 pm when there was no response. Finding his wife unconscious with her hands and feet tied, Ravi rushed her to a nearby private hospital where she was declared brought dead. The body was sent for post-mortem examination to Government Stanley hospital. She also had injuries on the head. The Madhavaram police, who checked CCTV camera footage from the area, found Rakesh, his wife Revathi and two children boarding an autorickshaw at 12.30 pm on Saturday. Police suspect the murder to have happened an hour before they escaped. None of the neighbours heard any unusual noise from the house, though there are two houses close by. Police suspect Rakesh killed the woman when she called him to the first floor to clean and paint a room.  “Special teams have been fanned out to several places in Karnataka. We are also following the CCTV footage and the suspect will be nabbed soon,” said an investigating officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/47-year-old-woman-found-dead-with-limbs-tied-at-madhavaram/articleshow/81620967.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Temperature to rise 2.5°C by 2050||MUMBAI: The average annual temperature of Maharashtra is likely to rise by up to 2.5 degrees Celsius by 2050 and the average monsoon rainfall in the state is expected to increase by up to 210mm by the end of the century, according to a study by a Baramati professor published in the prestigious journal Springer Nature. The weather changes are projected to have a serious negative impact on agriculture. The study, by Rahul Todmal, assistant professor of geography at Vidya Pratishthan's ASC College in Baramati, says that most parts of the state are very likely to experience a rise in annual average temperatures ranging between 0.5 and 2.5 degreed Celsius up to 2050, and considerably warmer conditions after 2033. Among the regions that are expected to register significant warming of over one degree Celsius are parts of the Konkan and Madhya Maharashtra. The study indicated that over five decades, annual mean minimum temperatures are expected to rise 0.1-1.2°C across 80% of districts.  It makes projections based on climatic data from the Earth System Grid Federation, Germany, and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, which reveal that the state is expected to witness an increase of 150-210mm in average monsoon rainfall till 2100, apart from the Konkan coast. Parts of the Vidarbha sub-division and Western Ghats will get 82-225 mm more. “A substantial increase in monsoon rainfall and extreme events over Maharashtra would result in flashy runoff, which can cause catastrophic floods,” observed the study. Todmal said existing literature shows that climate change in Maharashtra are likely to have an impact on agriculture. “Agronomic studies have confirmed that warmer climatic conditions never favour agricultural productivity. The future rise in temperature is very likely to reduce the productivity of traditional rain-fed crops and irrigated cash crops as well,” he said. Previous literature cited in the study have estimated up to a 49% decline in the yield of various crops due to rising temperatures. Some crops may be more impacted than others, feel experts, one of whom, AN Ganeshamurthy, said, “Under the circumstances presented by the study, temperature variations may marginally affect the productivity of principal crops like sugarcane, rice, sorghum and millet. However, it may have some major effect on wheat productivity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mumbaistate-to-warm-up-2-5c-by-50-get-210mm-more-rain-by-2100/articleshow/81624061.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar
---||Chennai||Robbery suspects spill the beans on double murder||Chennai: Police stumbled on a two-week-old double murder in Velachery on Saturday while interrogating a six-member gang who robbed a doctor and four nurses at a clinic at Nandanam extension last week.  On March 13, two men had entered a private hospital at Nandanam extension around 10.30 pm and robbed 73-year-old doctor Ramakrishnan and his four staff nurses at knifepoint, and escaped with 21 sovereigns of gold and the doctor's car. A special team headed by Adyar Deputy Commissioner V Vikraman, with the help of CCTV camera footage, traced the car the robbers arrived in to Sivaganga district. It belonged to a real estate broker and murder accused, Annadurai, and was in the possession of his friend Rakkappan alias Ravikumar, 42, of Sivaganga. Police picked up Rakkappan, Venkatesan, 44, of Mylapore and Nelson, 47, of Kotturpuram for questioning. Based on their statements, Srinivasan, 45, of Anakaputhur, 'Rajini' Ezhumalai, 55, and Raja Singam, 33, were also detained. During interrogation, police said, the gang told them they had killed Annadurai and his friend Thankapandi and dumped their bodies in a well on Velachery main road in Guindy on March 9. Police recovered the bodies from the well. Police said Annadurai had approached Rakkappan, a contract killer, in 2015 to murder a BSP man Murugan who had defeated Annadurai's relative in councillor election. Annadurai allegedly promised Rakkappan that he would bail him out and extend all legal support in the case. However, he failed to keep up his promise. That’s why Rakkappan decided to kill him, police said. On March 9, Rakkappan called Annadurai for a meeting saying there was some land for sale. When Annadurai turned up with Thangapandi, the gang killed them both, police said. Guindy police registered a murder case and remanded the six in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/robbery-suspects-spill-the-beans-on-double-murder/articleshow/81620950.cms||---

A subset of these patients has been asymptomatic for the initial few days before going on to have severe disease. SevenHills doctors have treated a 40-year-old who went from mildly symptomatic to high oxygen dependence in four days. Intensivist Dr Rahul Sawalia said she needed a non-invasive ventilator. It was an unusual case as involvement of 80% of the lung takes a minimum of ten days. Live updates: Coronavirus pandemic“We have observed this swift progression in a few young patients in the second wave,” he said. In another case, a patient’s lungs developed a fully cloudy appearance in a span of 18 hours that he took to travel from his native place to SevenHills. This patient was a senior citizen and couldn’t be saved. Read AlsoCovid can cause permanent damage to lungs, says studyMEERUT: A research by Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago, has found that Covid-19 in some patients can lead to irreversible and permanent lung damage, rendering them irrecoverable, and leaving lung transplantation as the only option for survival. Meerut-born Dr Ankit Bharat, chief of thoracicAt the BKC jumbo facility, doctors have not just seen young patients deteriorating fast, they found many were asymptomatic in the initial days. BKC dean Dr Rajesh Dere said many who are asymptomatic tend to neglect and become severe all of a sudden. Coronavirus outbreak: Complete coverageA senior doctor from BKC jumbo said 15-20% of asymptomatic cases have X-rays showing an involvement of lungs. “Patients whose X-rays are bad also have high D-dimer levels, indicative of active formation of blood clots,” said the expert, adding that in spite of blood thinners, D-dimer remains high. Read AlsoDocs: All Covid lung scarring not fibrosis, 90% fully healedMedical experts in the country have called for an urgent rethink of a key term that is in use to describe Covid-linked lung damage. ‘Post-Covid lung fibrosis’ indicates lung scarring after an infection, but doctors now believe it is wrong to call every Covid-triggered lung scarring ‘fibrosis’. TheyThe Covid-19 death audit committee has noted at least five deaths in young patients. “It has been reported to us. The numbers are not too high, but a few young patients have succumbed. We are trying to understand if this quick progression is more common than we know,” said Dr Avinash Supe, chairman of the death audit committee. Vashi’s MPCT Hospital has treated a 27-year-old who came in a critical condition and had to be started on remdesivir and non-invasive ventilator immediately on admission.

But a book ‘The Conductor’ on his journey and an accompanying art show in the city puts him in a new perspective as an abstract painter. “I feel lucky that at the age of 85 years, I’m able to display artwork that’s about 50 years old. In a way, it’s not just my journey, but also of the ‘Baroda Group’ that played a major role in pushing the boundaries of Indian art in late 1950s and early 1960s,” Parimoo told TOI. “N S Bendre, my teacher, taught us the basics of painting that laid foundation of the experiments. While some like Shanti Dave moved to Delhi and practised the abstract art, some branched out in other forms as well.” He added that abstract expressionism of that period preceded the ‘official recognition’ of the form by the US in 1968-69 when the genre along with minimalism got global shows of the eminent artists. “In a way, we got a unique voice from Vadodara earlier than the West,” he said. The ‘pure’ abstract, according to Parimoo, has elements such as non-recognizable subject, non-objective, non-figurative ideation, and colour and form are the main characteristics. Thus, the book describes Parimoo as a conductor of an art symphony where he composes his ideas, thoughts, emotions and feelings through arrangements of forms, colours and textures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/abstract-art-found-early-voice-in-vdara/articleshow/81626384.cms||---

For the next two days, the health department had no idea about them of being infected with the virus. On the third day (March 21), the health department received information from the laboratory about the cases. While the city is witnessing a spike in cases, the health department is focusing on contact tracing to prevent further spread of the virus. For almost two days, contact tracing of infected persons was not done, despite that Indian Council of Medical Research and the health department has issued orders to all private testing laboratories to ensure immediate/real time reporting to state officials of integrated disease surveillance programme for timely initiation of contact tracing. A health department official said, “Some private laboratories are not sending the report of positive cases on time. We need information of those who tested positive in private laboratories for conducting contact tracing. But some private laboratories are sending reports after two to three days and precious time for contact tracing is lost.” A private laboratory sent information of seven persons who tested positive without proper address. In the address column, the lab mentioned ‘Jaipur Raj Pin:’ “We need addresses to reach the houses of the persons infected with Covid for conducting contact tracing. We have rapid response team for conducting activities to prevent infection further. If private laboratories don’t send report on time and without proper addresses, it becomes difficult to conduct contact tracing on time, which enhances risk of spread of the virus,” said the official. The Centre has also appealed to the states to conduct contact tracing of atleast 20 persons who were in contact with infected persons for early identification, isolation and treatment of the infected persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/labs-sending-late-covid-reports-hit-contact-tracing/articleshow/81621005.cms||---

The death of two tigers on consecutive days and three in eight days caused a flutter among wildlife lovers and officials. Social media was agog with sharp reactions putting a question mark over conservation. As per the all-India Tiger Estimation 2018, there are 312 tigers in the state. Experts say the tigress is said to be 15-month-old sub-adult, one of the offspring of a resident Bor tigress Ambika aka T1. The latest death has pushed the tiger toll in Maharashtra in the last 79 days to 11. On Saturday, an eight-month-old tiger cub was found dead inside Umred-Karhandla-Paoni Wildlife Sanctuary. “The spot, where the female sub-adult was found dead on Sunday, is around 15km from the boundary of Bor and officials are verifying whether the tiger that died was from the park. There is presence of tigers in a defunct explosives factory in Kelzar too,” said forest officials. Quoting post-mortem report by wildlife veterinarians, acting deputy conservator of forest (DyCF), Wardha, Tushar Dhamdhere, claimed the animal was a four-year-old tigress. DFO (wildlife) Rahul Gavai said, “We are still matching pictures from Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and data bank with us and only then can confirm the identity of the tigress.” Dhamdhere ruled out foul play as all body parts were intact. “However, veterinarians opined there were some changes in the intestine. They ruled out electrocution. We are sending samples to the Regional Forensic Laboratory, Nagpur, for histopathology and toxicological tests to know the exact cause of death,” said Dhamdhere. He said, “According to residents, the area where the animal was found dead is not inhabited by big cats. It is quite possible that the tiger must have fallen into six-feet deep canal of Bor dam and must not have been able to come out and drowned.” Of the 11 tiger deaths since January 1, 2021, six were reported from Umred-Karhandla alone, two from Wardha division, one each was found dead in Sipna division in Melghat and another in Bhadravati range.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/one-more-tigress-found-dead-outside-bor/articleshow/81621002.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The ‘pure’ abstract, according to Parimoo, has elements such as non-recognizable subject, non-objective, non-figurative ideation, and colour and form are the main characteristics. Thus, the book describes Parimoo as a conductor of an art symphony where he composes his ideas, thoughts, emotions and feelings through arrangements of forms, colours and textures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abstract-art-found-early-voice-in-vdara/articleshow/81621003.cms||---

But gathering forensic evidence to establish the case in court will be a challenge as the deceased, Mahendra Arya, has already been cremated by his family and friends.Arya and his friends would sometimes go up to the mezzanine floor of the shop after work to play a game of cards. On the night of March 17, Arya was playing with his friends when a history sheeter, Surya, landed up with his associates. An argument broke out after which Surya and his men allegedly assaulted Arya’s friend, Prakash. CCTVs also captured one of them slapping Arya. Subsequently, Arya lost consciousness and collapsed. His friends rushed him to a nursing home where he was pronounced dead.“The deceased’s family contacted a local physician who issued a death certificate. On the morning of March 18, Arya was cremated,” said a police officer. But on March 19, his family learnt of the assault and approached the police to file a case of murder. After checking the CCTV footage, the police registered a murder case and arrested Surya and his associates. But without a postmortem examination, Arya’s exact cause of death remains unknown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaikin-struggle-to-prove-case-of-murder-as-body-cremated/articleshow/81622401.cms||---

It became intense since Harkesh met with an accident and was at home without work,” said Vidhyadhar Nagar SHO Virendra Kureel. Police have collected the evidence from the crime spot which suggest that the accused had first used utensils to hit the victim. The injury mark around the neck suggests that the accused had used force that killed the victim instantly. Police are taking the statements of the couple’s children. “The accused seemed to be under financial stress as per the statements of children and neighbours,” said police.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana leads major states doling out direct benefit transfer to farmers||HYDERABAD: At 8 % of the budget earmarked for implementing the DBT (direct benefit transfer) for farmers, Telangana has the highest budget expenditure among all states implementing such schemes for farmers. Telangana was the first state in the country to spend Rs 35,671 crore from 2018-2020 for the implementation of Rythu Bandhu, the investment support scheme for farmers. DBT for farmers also has the distinction of distributing benefit twice a year, unlike other states. The state gives Rs 5,000 per acre per season, twice a year. After Telangana introduced this scheme in 2018- 19, other states including neighbouring Andhra Pradesh began similar schemes. The schemes are Rythu Bharosa (AP), Kalia (Odisha), Mukhyamantri Kisan Ashirwad Yojana (Jharkhand) and Krishak Bandhu (West Bengal). Taking the budget expenditure of these schemes into account for the financial year 2019-20, Telangana has spent 8% while AP has spent 5%, Odisha 4%, Jharkhand 2% and West Bengal 1%. Under Rythu Bharosa (AP), farmers families get Rs 7,500 per acre (irrespective of land holding size) in a year and tenant farmers also gets the benefit. Under the Kalia scheme (Odisha) assistance is Rs 10,000 per farmer for cultivation. For landless agricultural households, only Rs 12,500 is given to each landless householders for agricultural and allied activities. Under Mukhyamantri Kisan Ashirwad Yojana (Jharkhand) Rs 5,000 is provided to marginal and small farmers per acre per year (max up to 5 acres). Under the Krishak Bandhu scheme in West Bengal, farmers with one or more acre land-holding is entitled for Rs 5,000 per annum assistance, with minimum Rs 2,000 per annum assistance on a pro rata basis. Interestingly Telangana has no restrictions in giving the benefit, only condition is the benefactor has to be a land owner. However, in 2020, 90% of the Rythu Bandhu scheme beneficiaries were marginal and small farmers (with landholdings less than 5 acres). In the recent budget introduced for the year 2020- 21, government has increased budget allocation and allocated Rs 14,800 crore for this scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-leads-major-states-doling-out-dbt-to-farmers/articleshow/81622393.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Though the ACB has 60 new officers who are being inducted in various ranks, they need more manpower as cases continue to rise. “We have been working with a very limited manpower and had approached the authorities to provide us more.

Environmentalist Kishor Pathak said this was the second such incident — of mass fish death — within a short span of time at the lake. “In July 2020, many fish had died due to contaminated water. The civic authorities failed to take cognizance of that incident, which has led to a repeat,” he said. The excess growth of algae in the lake due to high level of pollutants has been blamed for the lack of sufficient oxygen in the water — eventually causing the fish and other aquatic creatures to die. The issue of water pollution at the Salim Ali lake remains unaddressed till date as the direct release of sewage from nearby localities continues unabated. A spot visit to the lake reveals multiple points from where pollutants are released into the water. Wildlife enthusiast Waseem Quadri said the increased pollution level was harming the overall ecosystem of the lake. “While the dead fish are visible, deaths of other creatures go unnoticed. Losing such creatures affects the food chain,” he said. Civic garden superintendent Vijay Patil did not respond to the phone calls or text messages sent to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/fish-found-dead-in-salim-ali-lake/articleshow/81619068.cms||---

In this year so far, the agency has trapped around 84 public servants including IPS, RPS and RAS officers.Sleuths attributed the traps and accelerated movement in tackling corruption cases to team work and the toll free number. “Daily, we are getting more than 100 calls from people who are harassed by the system. There are senior citizens, young entrepreneurs and people from all walks of life. We are trying our level best to give voice to the problems faced by these people legally,” said ACB DGP BL Soni. Soni added that laying traps is not an easy task for the sleuths. “After a complainant approaches us, we need to verify the complaint and many a times the accused senses our activities. And even after the trap, we work hard in getting prosecution sanction and making a strong charge-sheet so that these officers involved in corrupt practices do not go scot-free ,” said ACB ADG Dinesh MN said. ACB officials said out of 84 traps, five cases against the officers involved in misuse of office and possessing disproportionate income were lodged. “Also, we have asked every investigating officer that if they need our cooperation in the paper work related to the granting of prosecution sanction, we are always ready to help,” Dinesh added.In this year so far, ACB had trapped two SDMs in Dausa and Dausa ex-SP for asking money from contractors of a company involved in construction of Bharat Mala project.“In the case of Kailash Bohra, the assistant commissioner of police who asked for sexual favour from a rape survivor, we have ensured every cooperation and safety to the woman,” said a senior officer of ACB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/acb-gives-sleepless-nights-to-corrupt-practices-84-traps-this-year-so-far/articleshow/81621010.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Mumbai||Mumbai:Slow supply affecting vaccine drive to certain extent: Chahal||Mumbai: The slow supply of vaccines was holding back the city’s Covid inoculation drive to “a certain extent”, BMC chief I S Chahal said on Sunday. He said the BMC has urged for a supply of one lakh doses per day and relaxations to take the drive to almost people’s doorsteps.While centres across Thane, Navi Mumbai, Panvel and Pune had complained of inadequate doses, this is the first time that Mumbai seems to be walking a tightrope with vaccine stocks. When TOI asked Chahal if there was an issue with vaccine availability, he said, “Yes, to a certain extent, especially supply of Covishield”. Sources said Mumbai has doses to last around five days, and a scale-up would be challenging if BMC does not get vaccines this week. Chahal said his target of one lakh vaccinations a day can be achieved comfortably if the Ce-ntre grants permission to 26 hospitals waiting to join the drive. “They can do additional 25,000 vaccinations a day,” he said. Many centres were surprised to receive Covaxin as they are not in the list of centres giving the Bharat Biotech vaccine. A private hospital head told TOI that they were told to give Covaxin to those taking the first dose. “We have been asked to conserve Covishield doses for those coming for their second shot,” the head said. All this while, only five civic centres and JJ Hospital were administering Covaxin. The head of a jumbo facility confirmed that Covaxin supply has been augmented.Meanwhile, a handful of private centres remained open on Sunday to gauge response. “...But the turnout was disappointing,” said Dr Prince Surana, CEO of Surana Hospital. He said around 165 people came to take the shot compared to nearly 300 on weekdays. The response was similar at Bombay Hospital, said physician Dr Gautam Bhansali. All civic centres, that cover almost 80% of the city’s vaccination, remained closed. Private hospitals have so far proved to the weak link in the drive. “Most are vaccinating 300-400 a day, while public centres are giving 2,000-4,000 doses,” said a civic official. He, however, admitted there was vaccine hesitancy among some citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaislow-supply-affecting-vaccine-drive-to-certain-extent-chahal/articleshow/81621672.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Mumbai:It’s BMC vs chief of panel over Rs 32cr plan to hire guards||Mumbai: In a face-off between the Shiv Sena-led standing committee chairman Yashwant Jadhav and the BMC administration, BMC chief Iqbal Chahal has sent a Rs 32 crore proposal to hire private security guards, passed by the standing committee to the state government for scrapping. Last year, the BMC administration withdrew the proposal to give a Rs 32 crore contract to Eagle Security & Personnel Services from the civic standing committee and said that it would relook the proposal in the wake of allegations that the tenders were rigged.However, the standing committee passed the proposal. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra, the party’s leader in BMC, demanded a high level probe into the awarding of a Rs 32 crore contract for hiring private security guards after allegations that the tenders were rigged and BMC wanted to hire bouncers from a private agency at exorbitant costs.BJP has also filed a PIL against the standing committee chairman, Yashwant Jadhav, in Bombay high court. In the PIL, BJP corporators Makarand Narvekar and Mishra have alleged that they were forced to move court to “stop blatant corruption and a clear nexus between the present disposition in BMC, the standing committee chairman and the contractors.”Mishra has written to chahal demanding that another Rs 189 crore tender for which the same company has been shortlisted be scrapped too. “I would like to point out that despite your instructions, the chief security officer has not yet scrapped a Rs 189 crore tender of the same nature, where once again Eagle Security & Personnel Services has been shortlisted by rigging and cartelisaiton. I’m sure you will once again act in the interest of the BMC scrap this tender. However, if no action is taken, I will have to again move high court in this regard too, seeking scrapping of the tender,” Mishra said in his letter.Chahal confirmed to TOI that he has sent the standing committee resolution to the state urban development department for scrapping and directed that the Rs 189 crore tender be scrapped too. Eagle Security and Personnel Services did not respond to an email from TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiits-bmc-vs-chief-of-panel-over-rs-32cr-plan-to-hire-guards/articleshow/81622405.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Vadodara||No consistency in deciding on containment zones||Vadodara/ Rajkot: When the Covid-19 pandemic had started almost a year ago, entire streets, localities and residential areas were barricaded, declared as containment zones. Later, all the civic bodies across Gujarat had shifted their strategies. Instead of barricading the entire localities, micro containment zones were declared and stickers declaring houses, individual apartments and bungalows as micro-contained were posted. But now, all the municipal corporations seem to be adopting contradictory stands when it comes to handling Covid-19 in their respective cities. While municipal corporations like Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) and Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) have completely done away with the practice of posting stickers outside households, the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) continues posting such stickers. Similarly, as Gujarat is witnessing another surge of Covid-19 cases, SMCSurat civic body and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) have started declaring cluster containment or micro containment areas which the Vadodara civic body doesn’t. VMC and RMC officials cite the Supreme Court (SC) order of December last through which all states and union territories were directed not to put up home isolation posters outside houses of Covid-19 patients. VMC medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that the civic body is not pasting stickers as it would be a violation of directives of the apex court. But he added that if it came to light that there were many houses in a particular area with positive cases, the civic body could consider putting up material to declare them as containment zones. “We declare micro containment zone, inform society chairman or president and also send a copy to police department. They advise the residents to follow the rules of containment zone,” said an RMC official. It is, however, not just about posting stickers outside houses. SMC for instance has dedicated personnel which sanitize houses of Covid-19 patients and even collect the garbage generated from such patients who are in home isolation. In contrast, in Vadodara discarding daily garbage remains a challenge for Covid-19 positive patients. “When I inquired about it on VMC’s helpline number, I was told that I should simply hand it over to those collecting door-to-door garbage for all societies. Isn’t that putting everybody including the ‘safai karmacharis’ at risk?” said a Vadodara resident, while sharing his experience of home isolation. Additional city engineer Shailesh Naik said that the department had formed teams to collect garbage from the residents of Covid-19 patients who were under home quarantine.

---||Goa||Council polls: Fate of 423 candidates to be known today||PANAJI: The counting for Saturday’s civic elections, which will be held on Monday, will not only decide the fate of 423 candidates, but also that of the political parties, who are looking to gain control of the councils. Counting will commence at 8am and the results expected by 10am. Elections to six municipal councils — Pernem, Valpoi, Bicholim, Canacona, Curchorem and Cuncolim — and the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP), byelections to 18 different wards of village panchayat and the Navelim zilla panchayat constituency were held on Saturday. All seven municipal council areas are represented by BJP in the assembly. However, in five, the legislators had switched over from Congress in mid-2019. These MLAs will be looking out for a win on Monday to prove their popularity, political commentators said. Despite the increase in Covid cases in the state, the polls witnessed a high turnout leaving the candidates and political parties guessing about the outcome. Coming three months after the zilla panchayat elections when BJP swept the polls, the ruling party is expecting to do well with the candidates they backed. Even before the results, BJP has made it clear that there is more than one BJP candidate in each ward and that if a BJP karyakarta who contested as an independent wins, he will support the respective MLA’s panel. A political observer said that even if BJP falls short in some municipalities to form the panel, they will immediately approach the independent candidate to get their support to make sure that all the municipalities are under their control. All eyes are on the prestigious CCP as Panaji MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate has vowed to secure all 30 seats, which even former defence minister and chief minister Manohar Parrikar could not manage, despite representing the constituency for two-and-a-half decades. In a fiercely fought battle in 2015, the Monserrate panel had won 15 seats in the 30-member corporation. To form the council, Monserrate had sought the support of two independnets — Surendra Furtado and his wife, Ruth. BJP had to be content with 13 seats.  This time, though Monserrate is in BJP, there was strong opposition to his panel. The rebels may have been silenced by the BJP leadership, but the We Ponjekar panel and some independents received good support in the run up to the polls. In Navelim, where the bypoll was held for the South Goa zilla panchayat, relatively low polling gave some anxiety in the Congress camp where stakes are high for the opposition party as its state Mahil chief Pratima Coutinho is in the fray. A political observer said that the results are crucial for BJP as they will face the second phase of municipal elections in five municipalities — Margao, Mapusa, Mormugao, Sanguem and Quepem — soon. Recently the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the high court to cancel elections to the five municipalities over the reservation of wards. The average polling in the six municipalities was 83.2%. Pernem recorded the highest turnout of 91%, while the turnout for the CCP polls was lowest at 70.3%. The byelection for a ward in the Sakhali Municipal Council recorded a 87.7% voter turnout. The turnout was comparatively low for the Navelim ZP bypoll, which registered only 57.5% polling. Officials said that 83.8% voting was recorded in the byelection for 18 wards of various panchayats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/council-polls-fate-of-423-candidates-to-be-known-today/articleshow/81621704.cms||Murari Shetye

Mayor G Hari Venkata Kumari appended her first signature on the document on March 20, Saturday. As the GVMC’s water sources like Thatipudi, Raiwada, Yeleru, Mehadrigedda and Mudasarlova reservoirs were filled to the brim during the rainy season and still maintain good water levels, the action plan focused on the areas reeling from water supply shortage. About four to five years ago, the GVMC used to spend about Rs 7-8 crore on the summer action plan as the civic body had to pump water from the dead storage of several reservoirs like Yeleru. Besides proposing about 123 new borewells in various parts of the city, GVMC will also take up repairs of the existing hand borewells and pipeline network under the summer action plan-2021. According to the officials, the GVMC will hire 19 additional tankers for the summer months to supply water to the tail-end points of the city. These tankers will make nearly 119 additional trips to these areas for 91 days. The mobile water tankers would help meet the water supply needs in the hilly areas and unserved areas of merged Panchayats of Bheemili and Anakapalli. While Rs 7.5 lakh has been allocated for desilting of infiltration wells of Gosthani, Rs 3 lakh would be spent on laying sandbags across the Gosthani riverbed for storage of water at Sammayyavalasa pump house at the time of releasing water from Thatipudi Reservoir. With rapid industrialisation and inclusion of Bheemili and Anakapalle in GVMC, the city is already observing a lowered water supply than the demand. Water scarcity has become a common occurrence in and around Madhurawada and Bheemili areas as the infiltration wells of Gosthani reservoir dries up each year during the summer months. The aged and decayed water pipes, which were laid about 20 to 30 years ago, with frequent leaks and bursts, are also a concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-prepares-rs-3-2cr-action-plan-for-summer/articleshow/81620245.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Amid Covid fears, RTC to add non-AC buses||VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) is planning to introduce non-AC sleeper buses into its fleet to meet passenger requirements and keep up with competition from private operators.  With the shadow of Covid-19 still looming and a likelihood of cases increasing, passengers have been wary of travelling in AC buses. The RTC’s most sought-after AC services such as Garuda, Garuda+, Amaravati, and Vennela are currently operating at low occupancy over fears of virus contraction. A common perception among people has been that the chances of virus contraction is higher in AC buses as there won’t be a free flow of air. The situation has led to an increase in demand for non-AC services. At the same time, there had been a steady increase for sleeper buses even before the pandemic broke out. Private operators were quick to act on the demand and had started to add non-AC buses to their fleet. The RTC had already been facing tough competition from private operators but the recent demand for non-AC buses has increased the pressure on the corporation as it has been losing customers for its premium services which generate most of its revenue. In a bid to catch up with the demand, the corporation is planning to introduce these non-AC buses in a phased manner. APSRTC vice-chairman and managing director RP Thakur said they have been exploring options various options to add a new segment to their fleet. “We have discusing whether to buy new buses or upgrade existing buses to sleeper buses by rebuilding the body,” Thakur said. He added that as the cost of rebuild will be around 40% of a new bus, the RTC will be adding new buses but in a limited manner in the first phase. “We want to be the toughest competitor for private players by offering a wide range of services to passengers. Though there are financial constraints, we have been adding new buses every year in place of condemned buses and this time we wanted to introduce a new segment of buses,” Thakur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/amid-covid-fears-rtc-to-add-non-ac-buses/articleshow/81619930.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The burglars also took with them hard disks from the temple. The incident took place near Three Town police and the district police headquarters. Police visited the crime scene and found that the back door to the temple was broken open to gain entry into the sanctum sanctorum. Police said the keys to the almirah, where the jewellery was kept, were hanging on the wall, making it easy for the miscreants to remove the ornaments. They also snapped the connection to 17 CCTV cameras and took away the hard disk and the VCR along with them to remove any clue. The collection box was broken and the cash removed. Some coins were found on the floor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/thieves-break-into-temple-decamp-with-gold-silver/articleshow/81620137.cms||Nalla.Babu

State BJP president Somu Veerraju on Sunday announced that a 24-member committee, including Rajya Sabha MPs TG Venkatesh, CM Ramesh, Sujana Chowdary and TG Venkatesh, will hit the campaign trail. The party think tank also appointed constituency-wise in-charges. The YSRC leadership has already appointed seven ministers as constituency in-charges with four Rajya Sabha MPs also in the campaign committee. The BJP has made it clear that the Tirupati by-elections is a crucial contest for the BJP-Jana Sena partnership. Veerraju slammed the YSRC, alleging misuse of the volunteer system to score victories in the recently-concluded local body elections.“If the volunteers are really neutral and equidistant from all parties, I challenge the government to appoint BJP workers in the same posts,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/4-rajya-sabha-mps-in-bjp-team-for-tirupati-ls-bypoll/articleshow/81620312.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Chillapalli said they could achieve their demands by exerting pressure on the government only when they were united and fought for the cause. Addressing a meeting of the Devanga community (a weaver sub-caste) here on Sunday, Chillapalli said that CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had done more than what backward classes communities expected from the political system in the last two years. He added that the CM had granted over 80% of mayor seats and municipal chairperson posts to SC, ST, BC and minorities. “We could not even dream about such empowerment of the backward classes in the past. CM is very particular to do more in the coming days,” said Chillapalli. He added that weavers were unable to achieve progress due to divisions in the community and urged elders to take the lead in bringing about unity. Chillapalli said that the Apco is initiating several measures to boost the market for handloom products in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/unity-crucial-for-upliftment-of-weavers/articleshow/81620172.cms||---

The man, 25, suspected that his wife was having an affair with someone in the village. He fled from the house leaving his wife in a pool of blood. The woman somehow sought help from her mother and was rushed to a hospital in Rampur’s Milak area. The accused was arrested on Saturday and sent to jail, within hours after the attack. Circle officer (CO) of Milak area, Srikant Prajapati, told TOI, “The accused is a drunkard. He drives a combine harvester and often used to go out for days during the harvesting season. He suspected that his wife was in a relationship with another man. He was not feeling guilty for his act.” Rampur’s superintendent of police (SP) Shogun Gautam said, “The medical examination of the woman has confirmed that she had suffered serious injuries in her private parts. Her husband was arrested and sent to jail. We are ensuring that she gets proper treatment at the government hospital.” The woman also alleged that she had suffered miscarriage once after being kicked by her husband. “My husband used to beat me up for no reason. He also suspected that I had an extramarital affair. I had never imagined that he would indulge in such a horrible act,” said the woman. Kumar has been booked under IPC sections 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 498 A (harassment of the woman), 506 (criminal intimidation) along with sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-stitches-wifes-genitals-on-suspicion-of-infidelity/articleshow/81619513.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Pune||Vital Pashan lake has gone from pristine to polluted||Pune: The British-era Pashan lake, far from being a sought-after bird-watching spot for decades, now has floating garbage and hyacinth, and emanates a stench. A comparison of the chemical and biological oxygen demand of the Katraj and Pashan lakes shows that the latter with higher COD and BOD levels is much more sullied. Pollution over the years has increased in this lake, statistics in the Environmental Status Report of the Pune Municipal Corporation indicate.Locals have complained that the PMC authorities spend crores of rupees every year to clean up the hyacinth. Instead, a water treatment plant would help, they added. The PMC officials blamed the drainage water flowing into the lake from the villages on the hillside of Bavdhan, Bhugaon and Bhukum. Since these areas have not been merged with the PMC, they are unable to act, they added.Activist Sameer Uttarkar said the yearly amount spent to remove the hyacinth is a waste as all that money can be put forward for a permanent solution. “Every year, some Rs 7 to 8 crore is wasted in the cleaning of the lake or other projects related to it. Crores were also wasted by a corporator for so-called beautification work. But, if we have a sewage treatment plant uphill, the water flowing into Pashan lake will be clean. It will ensure that Ramnadi, which then flows via Sutarwadi-Pashan-Someshwarwadi-Baner to finally join the Mula river is also clean. Cleaner water will attract more migratory birds and the entire ecosystem will be rejuvenated. But, short-sightedness of the administration is leading to problems,” he added.Assistant municipal commissioner Jaydeep Pawar of Aundh-Baner ward agreed that an STP was needed. “There is a notification to merge some villages upstream with the PMC limits. After the merger, a development plan will be drawn up which will notify amenity spaces. It will also have an STP so that Ramnadi water is not polluted,” he said. PMC’s environment officer Mangesh Dighe said the lake’s eco-restoration was done in 2008-09. A compound wall was built, the embankment restoration was done and greenery was restored. “All the jungle that one can see is man-made. We had, at that time, taken up both Katraj and Pashan lake for restoration. While Katraj lake was restored to be a tourist spot, Pashan lake was not. We wanted it to be away from human interaction. Lake desiltation was the biggest work done here. We made an island inside the lake on 13 acres from the silt. Plantation was done on the island and this was such a reclusive space that migratory birds found a place with no human activity to live and roost,” he said. Ramnadi originates in Bhukum village and flows into the lake and out of it till it meets Mula river. The rapid urbanisation on the outskirts of Pune, especially in the uphill areas of the lake, is leading to sewage in the lake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vital-pashan-lake-has-gone-from-pristine-to-polluted/articleshow/81620247.cms||Ardhra Nair

The Sardar Sarovar Nigam Limited (SSNL) plans to demolish the dam and use its clay to build a Narmada sub-canal. The residents said that they use the dam water for irrigation, besides using it for drinking purposes for animals. A protection wall was constructed at the dam around two years ago. Earlier, in the absence of a protection wall, the rainwater used to flow into the sea or flood the Gadhidham and Adipur town. Thanks to the protection wall and also good monsoon over the last couple of years, the dam has seen good retention of rainwater for the first time in the last 20 years. “We had held the protest because without informing the villagers the government machinery started the work of demolition of the dam. We are using the dam water for irrigation purposes and have asked authorities to postpone the demolition work by two months. At present, the dam has an 18-feet water level. If the dam is damaged it may flood some low lying areas,” Gopal Hadiya, sarpanch of the village, said.The villagers are objecting that water will go waste if the dam is demolished ahead of the summer months. Water scarcity is common in the village during the summers.According to government officials, a Narmada canal is being constructed from Anjar to Mandvi. Clay from this dam is to be utilized in the construction of the proposed canal. “We don’t know about the reasons behind the move, the government asked us to demolish the dam so we are doing it,” B Shrinivasan, Engineer of SSNNL in Gandhidham, said.Kutch collector Praveena D K confirmed that the demolition work was halted after the protest of villagers. “The clay is needed for the construction of the Narmada canal so the decision is taken to break the dam. Excess water is stored in the dam which is not used for drinking or irrigation purposes. However, looking at protests of villagers the work was halted on Saturday,” Praveena said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/razing-of-centuries-old-dam-halted-after-villagers-protest/articleshow/81609189.cms||---

A case in point is the entire stretch of area next to the busy Sion-Panvel road. While the locals refer to it as the Nerul LP junction, old timers and urban historians will tell you that the initials stand for the iconic beer factory —London Pilsner—that came up over 47 years back. The beer factory, which has been in a dilapidated condition for quite some time now, will soon be razed to make way for a commercial tower in its place. But the name ‘LP’ continues to endure the ravages of time.Incidentally, the bus stop along the highway next to the factory site, is officially called ‘Nerul LP Stop’ .“We recently purchased the 24,000 sq m LP factory site which will be developed as a commercial-business hub because of its prime location,” said builder Suresh Patel. When reminded about the historical significance of Navi Mumbai’s first large-scale brewery, Pateladded, “History is certainly a big part of the place...perhaps, we can install a plaque at the site to inform the visitors about its origin.” The senior vice president of Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry (Navi Mumbai) Manohar Shroff observed, “Everything must change with time. The brewery that had employed many factory hands will now make way for a commercial tower that will facilitate hundreds of IT executives and other office staff.”Real estate broker Harish Sethi said, “I remember the popularity and affordability of LP beer in the late ’70s and early ’80s. But nothing lasts forever and change is the only constant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiiconic-brewery-at-nerul-to-now-make-way-for-new-tower-but-lp-endures/articleshow/81622439.cms||Vijay Singh

He, however, did not specify what that action would be. He also urged the general public to play the role of vigilante and report violations to him via email or Whatsapp. “Wearing of mask is mandatory and social distancing is a must. Failing to do so, the health authorities will take strict action. In case any restaurant/hotel/institution is violating the rules, kindly WhatsApp me on my number or email me at officeofhealthministergoa@gmail.com. Necessary action will be initiated by the government of Goa,” he said. He took to social media, urging the people of Goa to follow SOPs laid down by the government. In view of the rising cases in Kerala, Maharashtra and Karnataka, he said, “Every citizen needs to be vigilant. We have made testing accessible to all citizens and are working on doing our best to keep Covid under control.” “All we need from the citizens of Goa and those coming to the state, is their support in ensuring the same.” Last week, chief minister Pramod Sawant had ruled out the need for testing at the borders for tourists. He put the ball in the tourists’ courts saying they must take precautionary measure when in public places. “I had a discussion with health minister Vishwajit Rane. At least for now, we will not impose curfew nor will we have any ban, but will increase testing in a big way. No decision has been taken yet to have checks at border posts but hotels must do thermal checking of their guests,” he had said last on March 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-curbs-in-place-but-will-act-against-covid-violators-rane/articleshow/81621708.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Ahmedabad||Fee dispute: Ahmedabad district education officer gets Gujarat HC nod to cancel registration||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has permitted the district education officer (DEO) to cancel registration of Euro School in Hebatpur in case the school management does not resume online teaching for a Class 7 student, whose link for online classes was snipped by the school following a dispute over fees with her parent. On February 17, the DEO ordered the school management to resume teaching the student by sending her the link for online classes. The DEO also ordered it not to withhold the marksheet of the student’s elder sibling, who was studying in the same school in Class 10. The DEO had also ordered the school management not to repeat such mistake in future. This happened after the father of these students complained that the school stopped teaching his daughter over a dispute regarding fees. Justice Umesh Trivedi issued notice to the school management and the education authorities and sought reply by April 16. In the meanwhile,the court has permitted the DEO to cancel registration of the school, if it does not obey the February 17 order. The case involved a Vastrapur resident, Anshuman Shastr,i and his two daughters, Shararat (13) and Yugma (16). Shararat studies in Class 7 in Euro School, while Yugma was in Class 10 in the same school. Shastri entered into a dispute with the school over the amount of fees. He claimed that he had paid excess fees in previous academic year for his daughters given what the Fee Regulatory Committee (FRC) had permitted the school to collect. Due to Covid-19 pandemic situation, the government’s policy compelled the schools to collect only 75% of tuition fees. The school refused to adjust the excess amount paid by him the previous year towards the reduced fee in the current year and demanded the amount from him. When he refused, the school withheld Yugma’s Class 10 marksheet and stopped sending link for online classes to Shararat. According to Shastri’s advocate Vishal Dave, when Shastri complained about the school’s conduct before the education authority, the school claimed that it was granted an interim relief by the high court regarding the FRC’s decision of fee structure. However, the DEO rebuked the school and ordered it restart Shararat’s education and part with Yugma’s marksheet, which it had no right to block. When the school did not start teaching the student again, Shastri moved the HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/deo-gets-hc-nod-to-cancel-registration/articleshow/81621054.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh letter bomb: Probe on, no need for Anil Deshmukh to quit, says NCP||NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Amid speculation over the continuance of Anil Deshmukh as Maharashtra home minister after ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh’s “letter bomb”, NCP ruled out the minister's resignation late on Sunday, arguing that Singh’s allegations came after he was moved to an insignificant post. Earlier in the day though, Pawar had suggested that the decision on the home minister was for CM to make. “The ATS and the NIA are probing. The state government will probe this properly... any official, no matter how high up in the hierarchy, this is the government’s determination. There is no need for Deshmukh’s resignation,” NCP’s Jayant Patil said. The biggest need is to probe who placed the vehicle outside Mukesh Ambani’s residence and who killed the man (Mansukh Hiran),” he said after a meeting of party members. Though NCP stood by Deshmukh, sources did not rule out the possibility of him being moved from home and an inquiry being ordered into Singh’s allegations. NCP chief Sharad Pawar has suggested a probe by retired police officer Julio Ribeiro. Pawar, deputy CM Ajit Pawar, senior member Praful Patel and Patil took part in the discussions on Sunday. Congress member Kamal Nath also met Pawar, perhaps conveying his party’s views on the controversy. It is understood that NCP felt the allegations levelled by Singh lacked substance and could be seen as the act of a disgruntled officer. Pawar seemed to train his guns on the former Mumbai police chief, saying it was his decision to reinstate Waze. He said Singh’s claims of Waze being asked by Deshmukh to raise money from bars and restaurants were made after his transfer and neither the home minister nor chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had anything to do with Waze’s suspension being lifted. The political heat has brought pressure on NCP and names of likely replacements for Deshmukh are doing the rounds even. Pawar called the allegations raised by Singh “serious and sensitive”. He said the CM had full authority to take a decision. Pawar said he would like an inquiry into the issue by a personality above reproach — someone like ex- Mumbai police chief Julio Ribeiro — which will bring out the truth. Pawar said the allegations could be an attempt to destabilise the MVA government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/param-bir-singh-letter-bomb-probe-on-no-need-for-anil-deshmukh-to-quit-says-ncp/articleshow/81623567.cms||---

According to an FIR filed with Mehsana railway police on March 17, the incident came to light on March 13 after an alert passenger, an officer with the Indian Air Force, found the camera when he went to use the loo. The FIR mentioned that a passenger first saw the spy camera attached with a power bank inside a garbage bin of the toilet. When he asked about it with the accused Zaheeruddin Shaikh, 23, on board housekeeping staff of the railways, Shaikh told him that he did not know about it and took the camera and power bank along with him. After a while, when the same passenger again asked Shaikh if he had done something on the issue of camera and the power bank, Shaikh told the passenger that he did not have any authority to enquire into it and to take action. Shaikh took him to the TTE (travelling ticket examiner) after which he told the TTE Salim Bagwala about the incident. Bagwala called up railway police about the incident and a team of RPF (Railway Protection Force) began an inquiry into the case. Later, a case was filed with Mehsana police who began an inquiry into it. When the cops questioned Shaikh about the incident, he began fumbling while answering their queries. On further examination, he broke down before the cops and confessed his crime. He told cops that he had bought the camera and the power bank in Rs 2,000 from a cart near Ghatkopar railway station. He said that he was addicted of watching porn so he placed the camera inside washroom so he could capture women’s video whenever any women went to use the loo. Police booked Shaikh under charges of voyeurism and began an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/spycam-in-train-loo-cleaning-staff-held/articleshow/81621056.cms||---
---||Goa||ASI completes restoration of 400-year-old silver casket of St Xavier||PANAJI: The four-century-old silver Mastrillian casket containing the relics of St Francis Xavier has been restored at Bom Jesus Basilica, Old Goa. A multi-disciplinary team comprising ASI’s archaeological chemists, artists and photographers along with locally hired silversmiths, carpenters and labourers completed the painstaking work on the iconic 400kg casket, over a period of three months, on Sunday. They set up a mini laboratory in rooms provided to them within the Basilica. The casket comprises a main structure made of teak wood, covered with velvet cloth over which silver plates are fixed. All these parts needed to be taken apart for the restoration work. The silver was highly tarnished, and the cloth torn, worn out and very fragile, deputy superintending archaeological chemist, western zone, Aurangabad, Shrikant Misra told TOI. “We dismantled the casket into different parts and put all the parts in an airtight box. We released gas inside the sealed box for around 40 hours,” he said. “This is a fumigation process we follow for all antiquities from time to time to get rid of any biological activity,” he said. Extreme care had to be taken while pulling apart the casket with photographers and artists documenting the work every step of the way. “There were over 100 silver plates. We removed each one while carefully documenting and numbering them so that we would be able to refit them at the exact same place. Everything had to be done systematically, otherwise we would be left with a puzzle to put together,” Misra said. Only after removing the silver plates and velvet cloth were they able to assess the actual condition of the wooden portion. “Structurally the wooden structure was quite good despite it being more than 400 years old. There was only mild termite activity in some places outside the casket. Inside the actual casket there was no termite activity,” he said. Any cracks and holes caused by the nails were filled and the wooden portion completely treated and strengthened. A white cloth lining was fitted over the wood, over which the worn-out velvet cloth was replaced with a new cloth. “This cloth was selected after several technical discussions with textile engineers to ensure that it lasts long and matches the original colour. We carried many samples with us and narrowed down on the shade and colour after consultation with the Church authorities,” Misra said. The silver plates were also chemically treated and reaffixed using some of the original nails and some newly purchased ones. In addition to the meticulous restoration work that needed to be carried out, the team also had to worry about the security of the centuries old casket, which also has some semi-precious stones. “Security was a big concern because of the casket’s religious and antique value. We kept a close watch on all our staff and together with the Church authorities, didn’t permit any unknown person near our work place,” he said. Compared to other restoration work this one was different as it involved the combined treatment of the wood and silver, replacement of the cloth, and, finally, reassembling. “In restoration work of paintings, coins or sculptures only one aspect is involved. Here the work was physically very different as we were working with three different aspects — wood, cloth and silver pieces — which had to be dismantled, documented, treated and reassembled. It was a complete surgery of the casket and we gave it a completely new life,” Misra said. Box Fr Mastrilli had got the silver covering for the coffin made Times News Network Two years after St Francis Xavier was declared saint and patron of Goa, on February 19, 1624, the silver casket containing his relics were taken in procession to the Bom Jesus Basilica from St Paul’s College, said rector of the basilica, Fr Patricio Fernandes. The casket’s name, he said, refers to Fr Marcello Mastrilli, who was believed to have been revived from death through the intercession of St Xavier. Fr Mastrilli came to Goa in December 1635, on his way to Japan. Upon seeing the silver casket, he ordered a new silver covering for the coffin, which was completed in time for the feast in 1637. The mausoleum was placed at the St Francis Xavier Chapel on November 8, 1698, and on top of it was placed the Mastrillian casket. Since then nothing much has been documented about the conservation or restoration of the casket he said. In 2018, a team of experts from the Opificio delle Pietre Dure e Laboratori di Restauro di Firenze, who studied the artefacts from May 27 to June 3, stated that the casket must be attended to on top priority, or it would fall apart within the next ten years. ASI’s head office later shot down the Church’s proposal to send the casket to Italy for restoration and stated that ASI had specialists in India who could do the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/asi-completes-restoration-of-400-year-old-silver-casket-of-st-xavier/articleshow/81621717.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Nimesh told police that he brought the liquor in a private bus from Rajasthan. The cops said that the duo earlier did some petty jobs and also worked in the diamond polishing industry. For past some time, they were selling liquor illegally in the area. However, they were not arrested earlier by the police personnel. Bapunagar police detained them and sent samples collected from them for Covid-19 test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-son-charged-with-bootlegging/articleshow/81621057.cms||---

According to BMC data, the three agencies are fining around 20,000 people and collecting over Rs 40 lakh in fines on an average per day. Incidentally, Mayor Kishori Pednekar had last month asked the BMC’s clean-up marshals not to misbehave after reports of marshals breaking into fights with people surfaced. “Our objective is not to make money. It is to create awareness,” Pednekar had told the marshals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiover-22l-fined-for-not-wearing-mask-more-than-rs-44cr-collected/articleshow/81621720.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Out of the five, four of them were siblings aged four to eight years. The accident has come a day after three children playing hide-and-seek died after a part of a sand dune caved in while digging a tunnel at Todpura village under Udaipurwati police station area of Jhunjhunu district. The accident in Bikaner village came to light after the mother of the four children went looking for them at 4pm on Sunday. “The children got into a drum used for keeping food grain. After they got in, the lid got accidently locked,” said a senior police officer of Napasar police station. “The mother was stunned to discover the children in an unconscious state after she opened the lid of the drum. All the five were rushed to the hospital where they were declared brought dead,” the officer added. The woman screamed for help. The mother took the children out of the drum with the help of neighbours. The deceased siblings have been identified as Sewaram (4), Raveena (7), Radha(5) and Poonam (8). “The four were children of Bhayaram, a farmer. The fifth deceased has been identified as Maali who is Bhayaram's niece,” the officer said. Senior police officers said that the lids of these drums can get locked by accident. “The children may have tried to open it but failed as the lid was locked. An FSL team has also examined the site,” the officer said. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot condoled the deaths of five children in Bikaner on Sunday and the three kids who died in Jhunjhunu on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/trapped-in-a-drum-5-kids-dieplaying-hide-seek-in-bikaner/articleshow/81621718.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: 1 ration card & a 68-member family of Hindus, Muslims||PATNA: Believe it or not, but a family in Vaishali has 68 members. Not only that. The family members follow two different religions, if their ration card for distribution of foodgrains through fair price shop is to be believed. Suspecting anomaly in the distribution of ration through PDS shops under ‘one nation, one ration card’ scheme, Mahua SDO Sandeep Kumar has directed Chehrakalan block development officer (BDO) Kumud Ranjan to conduct a through investigation and lodge an FIR against PDS dealer Sanjay Kumar. “I have directed the BDO concerned to lodge an FIR against the dealer for committing fraud and ensure recovery of the foodgrains at the earliest,” Kumar told this newspaper over phone. The matter came to light during scrutiny of foodgrains distribution among the ration card holders in different blocks in the district recently. The officials were stunned to know that over 38 quintals of foodgrains were given to a particular family headed by one Jubaida Khatoon with Umesh Paswan and Navin Kumar as other members. Preliminary investigation revealed that the PDS dealer submitted the list of 68 beneficiaries of a family for free foodgrains and also at subsidized rates. Each family member on a ration card is entitled to get 5kg of wheat or rice per month. However, the ration card holders were given free foodgrains for six months during the nationwide lockdown to prevent spread of the Covid19 pandemic. One kg of gram was also provided to the card holders free of cost. When contacted, the BDO said a show-cause notice has been issued against the dealer. Earlier, the licence of a PDS dealer was cancelled under Marhaura block in Saran district for committing irregularities in the distribution of foodgrains to the ration cardholders. The SDO clarified that the ration card was issued from Marhaura in Saran district and they availed foodgrains from a PDS shop under Chehrakalan block under ‘one nation, one ration card’ policy. Bihar is the first state in the country to adopt ‘one nation, one ration card’ policy of the central government. Former union minister late Ram Vilas Paswan had played a significant role in the implementation of the scheme for convenience of the ration cardholders. Authoritative sources said 8.71 crore people, including 25 lakh families under Antyodaya Anna Yojana, were covered in the state under the National Food Security Act, 2013. Moreover, 23.39 lakh new ration card beneficiaries were added to the state after the outbreak of Covid pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/68-of-a-family-registered-in-one-ration-card-in-vaishali/articleshow/81621058.cms||Ramashankar
---||Kochi||Kochi: Miyawaki forest to come up at BPCL’s petrochemical park||KOCHI: The concept of miniature urban forests seems to be catching up among institutions with the latest being the BPCL Kochi Refinery launching an initiative to develop a Miyawaki forest on its new propylene derivatives petrochemical complex (PDPC) premises. Officials said that the initiative would ensure development of a green hub and a quicker and denser tree presence in the area. As part of celebrating the International Day of Forests on Sunday, Kochi Refinery executive director Sanjay Khanna launched the programme by planting the first sapling. Around 400 saplings of 22 different species were planted on Sunday. One-third of the total area of PDPC, that is about 40 acre, has been earmarked for the development of the green belt. The green belt development had started along with the construction activities and is scheduled to be completed by this month end. Miyawaki is a technique pioneered by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki that helps build dense, native forests. BPCL officials said that these miniature forests are being developed at various locations in the refinery under the guidance of former deputy conservator of forests N C Induchoodan. In the financial year 2020-21 alone, BPCL has planted more than 20,000 tree saplings and 10,000 plant saplings of more than 80 different species within the PDPC premises. Most of the tree saplings were procured from the Agriculture University & forest department nurseries in Thrissur. The green belt is being developed in the form of various parks such as herbal, fruit, bird and bamboo inside the complex. Similar miniature urban forest ventures have been done in the Indian Navy campus where two such units have been developed. The first is in 10 cents of land near the Navy Children School at Naval Base, and houses more than 100 species of trees and plants, which are also being used as an aid for educating children. Following its success, the Southern Naval Command (SNC) had also launched yet another Miyawaki-model afforestation inside the residential complex of Katari Bagh, Kochi, with special emphasis on medicinal and spice plants. Another successful venture has been at the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) covering around 10 cents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/miyawaki-forest-to-come-up-at-bpcls-petrochemical-park/articleshow/81619548.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai:‘Second wave’ fear leaves creases of worry at leather mfg workshops||Mumbai: Seated on the floor in an airless, tiny room off a narrow lane at Shuklaji Street in Grant Road, Mohammed Ali Hussain cuts the corner of a synthetic leather sheet for a purse while the Lata Mangeshkar number “Aayega, aayega, aayega aanewala...” from the film ‘Mahal’ on radio keeps company. Ironically, Hussain has little hope of the good old days returning soon.It’s been a year since the Prime Minister announced the ‘Janta Curfew’ to stop the spread of coronavirus, and now amid fears of a ‘second wave’ fear, many are of the opinion that another blanket lockdown won’t help. It could instead strike another blow at the livelihoods of people, especially migrant labourers.Though Hussain returned from his hometown in Bihar’s Darbhanga in January, nine months after the national lockdown was imposed, work has come in fits and starts. “Pre-lockdown, my monthly income was around Rs 15,000, now it doesn’t touch even Rs 13,000,” said Hussain, who supports a family of six. “Wapas bhi nahin ja sakta (Can’t even go back). We will starve there because there is no source of income and I have to repay a Rs 10,000 loan.”Hussain’s is not an isolated story. Bags, purses, embroidery and tailoring units that thrived in the thickly-populated, crowded pockets of Bhendi Bazaar, Madanpura, Nagpada and Kala Paani areas in central Mumbai are yet to recover from the shock they received from the sudden lockdown last year.  Shafi Ahmed, whose school and travel bag-manufacturing unit at Madanpura, employed 32 workers pre-lockdown, said: “We are making do with just 15 workers...also there is not enough work. March-April are the months when we would get huge orders as schools and colleges opened in June. But we are facing the crisis two consecutive years since teaching has gone online and people are not travelling much.”Women’s purse manufacturer and supplier Khushnood Farooqui at Lohe Ki Chawl pores over some papers at the counter, while a couple of workers sit idle. “Payments are stuck and sales have dropped to one-fourth of what it was before March last year. Many medium and small traders have downed shutters,” Farooqui lamented. Reji Philip, who employed 25 migrants from Kerala at his travel agency, now has just five employees. “There is negligible visa and ticketing work. It is difficult to even run the office. Most employees have decided to stay back and await complete re-opening,” he said. Advocate Khalid Ansari, who owns five shops and has even penned a script for a film on lockdown, said: “Things were becoming better, but the fear of another lockdown is discouraging many workers from returning to the city,” said Ansari, even as Zubair Azmi, director of Madanpura-based Urdu Markaz, nodded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaisecond-wave-fear-leaves-creases-of-worry-at-leather-mfg-workshops/articleshow/81621742.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Delhi||N corpn claims rise in property tax mop-up||New Delhi: North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Sunday claimed to have collected Rs 569 crore as property tax till March 19 this year. The corporation claimed it is Rs 28 crore more than the tax collected in the financial year 2019-20. Jai Prakash, mayor of north corporation, said that the boost in property tax collection was a “positive sign” towards the improvement of the financial health of the civic body. “So far, Rs 569 crore have been collected from over 4 lakh taxpayers this financial year, in comparison to the last year’s collection of Rs 540.9 crore from 4.17 lakh taxpayers,” he said, adding that it was possible because of civic body’s amnesty scheme, which was launched on January 27 this year. The scheme will end on March 31, the late date to submit property tax. The mayor also said that as many as 32,312 taxpayers have availed the benefit of amnesty scheme till March 19 this year. Rs 129.1 crore has been collected in the amnesty scheme. TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-claims-rise-in-property-tax-mop-up/articleshow/81621151.cms||---

Campaigning in Karur on Sunday, she said AIADMK supported CAA in Parliament. “If AIADMK was serious about the cause of Muslims, it would not have supported the bill in Parliament,” she said. “We may have different religious beliefs, but we stand united as Tamilians,” she said while campaigning at Aravakurichi where BJP has fielded its state vice-president K Annamalai. She said their rivals are trying to create division in the name of caste and religion. “They have brought NEET and prevented our children from studying MBBS. They introduced farm laws which are anti-farmer. The AIADMK government in the last four years was a benami government of BJP at the Centre. Both parties are working against the interests of Tamil Nadu and its people,” she said. Targeting the state government, she said crime against women has increased and even an IPS officer was not an exception, referring to the complaint of an IPS officer against a former DGP-level officer. Under local minister M R Vijayabhaskar, transport department became one of the most corrupt departments, she said. “There are over 23 lakh unemployed youth in the state. As soon as DMK comes to power, 3.5 lakh government posts will be filled with locals getting the opportunity than people from other states,” she said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/aiadmk-insincere-on-caa-says-kani/articleshow/81621167.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Agra||Husbands replace 2 Agra councillors for official tour to Andaman and Nicobar||AGRA: Agra mayor Naveen Jain has ordered an inquiry into a complaint that the husbands of two councillors replaced them during an official tour to Andaman and Nicobar Islands organised by the civic body recently. The complaint alleged that the councillors' husbands used “corporation money for their personal expenses”. The Andamans tour was held from March 14 to 19 for 110 councillors to explore the “various aspects of smooth functioning of the municipal body and tourism-related activities”. As many as 83 councillors were part of the tour which cost Rs 42,000 per individual. Around Rs 34 lakh were spent on the official trip of all the councillors. Several municipal bodies across the country have faced flak in the past for spending huge sums of money on “study tours” whose utility is often in question. According to a senior civic body official, the councillors were allowed to take their families on their own expenses. So, several councillors took their families with them and paid for their bills. However, there were two exceptions. Instead of ward 55 councillor Meena Devi and ward 65 councillor Sarvesh Devi, their husbands went on the official tour on "civic body expenses". Both the councillors belong to the Bahujan Samaj Party. Agra mayor Naveen Jain said, “After a complaint that husbands of two councillors went on an official study tour to Andamans, orders have been issued to probe the matter in detail. This is a serious case of malpractice. Suitable action will be taken." Municipal commissioner Nikhil T Funde said, “Two councillors have been identified for sending their husbands on the official tour in violation of norms. Notices have been issued to them for repayment of expenses borne by the municipal corporation on the tour. We will also be taking suitable action against staffers who allowed them to go." When contacted, one of the councillors whose husband went on the tour refused to comment on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/husbands-replace-agra-councillors-for-official-tour-to-andamans-inquiry-on/articleshow/81619550.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Footfalls dip at museum, malls & theatres but zoo still a draw||MUMBAI: The recent "trial show" of one of India's foremost standup comics inside a Thane mall was going over so badly that, at one point, he contemplated doing what American singer Akon did in Delhi when his greatest hits were met with glazed looks: crowd-dive. There was just one tiny problem. The "crowd" consisted of six people. On a Saturday evening. Watching them self-consciously giggle at his capers that didn't live up to the ticket price of Rs 400 a pop, the comic acknowledged the lack of strength in numbers. "The pressure to perform here is not on me," he quipped. "It's on you." While the punchlines could certainly have been better, the low turnout wasn't exactly the comedian's fault. Malls and entertainment venues across the city have been witnessing a new low in footfalls in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases in the state. Some malls and cultural venues such as the NCPA have cancelled shows owing to the fresh wave. At Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS), which is open from 10 am to 2.15 pm, the average number of visitors has dwindled from 300 per day when it opened in February this year to 180 to 240 per day since the beginning of March when the Covid-19 cases in Mumbai started rising. "Now it is 90 to 100 per day including weekends," says Sabyasachi Mukherji of CSMVS, adding that the decrease in visitors and cultural activities has immensely impacted the museum's revenue. He also attributes part of this fall to the museum's new cautionary measures: No more than 20 visitors in a gallery at a time, staggered entry into the Museum, strict circulation paths and close vigilance on mask-wearing and hand sanitization. "Our impression is that people, particularly Mumbaikars, are interested in coming to the museum - to see our galleries and also to spend time in our outdoor areas," says Mukherjee, adding that viewers can access the online programmes of the museum on its digital platform. Malls too appear to have been impacted. "Post lockdown, we had seen a steady growth in footfall and consumption week over week. Business recovered substantially in December 2020 and January 2021. But since the last week of February, we have seen that there is no growth in weekly footfall. In the past few days, there has even been a slight drop in footfall which could be due to the increasing number of Covid-19 cases," said Rajneesh Mahajan, CEO of Inorbit malls. Some malls have cancelled large scale events and public gatherings till the situation improves. While the crowds in cinema halls have thinned, multiplex chains attribute this to the absence of major theatrical releases. "Overall occupancy has not picked up since screening of films resumed in theatres in October 2020. It is only last week that the first Hindi mass entertainer in recent times, 'Roohi', was released. The movie had begun garnering footfall but Covid-19 infections have started rising again," said a multiplex owner. Others are hopeful. "With blockbuster releases coming up, we are optimistic that footfall would increase and theatres would perform better," said Mukesh Kumar, CEO of Infiniti Mall. Over at the Byculla zoo, footfalls have remained steady since its opening on February 15. "On weekdays there are around 2,000 people who visit while on Sundays, the number of visitors touch 10,000 as well," said Dr Sanjay Tripathi, director of the zoo, which is gradually planning to bring in giraffes, zebras, white lions and other footfall-raising fauna.

---||Kochi||Residents to protest against police curbs around temple||Thiruvananthapuram: A group of residents from nine housing associations and shopkeepers’ collectives at East Fort and West Fort are protesting against restrictions being imposed on free movement and access in areas declared as security zone around Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple. An action committee has been constituted under Fort association of residents’ consortium (FARC). Nine residents’ associations and vyapari vyavasayi ekopana samithi (VVES) units of East Fort and West Fort will launch a protest against police restrictions in the name of temple security from Monday. A dharna will be held at 5pm on Monday. “We have been denied freedom of movement in our own place of residence. The paths adjacent to the temple have been completely blocked. Initially when police restricted movement, we were told that it was meant for other public and local residents will not be affected. Now, we have been asked to look for other routes,” said FARC general secretary K P Madhusoodanan. Residents said that all routine activities were being affected due to restrictions being imposed on them by the police. They recalled an instance when a patient who returned in an autorickshaw after an eye surgery was made to walk all the way to his home after police denied entry to autorickshaw. “Even delivery of courier and food is being affected. Old people are being made to walk or take other routes to access vehicles. When we need to cover just 100-200m, we are being asked to take congested roads,” said Madhusoodanan. The shopkeepers in the area said that initially the roads were blocked during the time when Covid-19 spread was at its peak. “Temple staff were infected and naturally we also took caution to comply with the containment procedure. We were told that it would be temporary, now they have made it a permanent ploy to restrict the entry and exit. Many shops have been closed and people have lost their means of livelihood because police wouldn’t let people access shops even for basic needs,” said VVES East Fort unit presidents Dhanesh Chandran. The residents’ association and merchants had forwarded a complaint to the chief minister in February citing the hardships faced by people. Around 20 members had also met the city police commissioner. A meeting was also held recently. “Instead of addressing our genuine concerns, the commissioner put forward suggestions that would obstruct free movement of local residents. The decisions are autonomous and illegal,” said Madhusoodanan. City police commissioner did not respond to TOI’s request for comment on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/residents-to-protest-against-police-curbs-around-temple/articleshow/81619551.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Patna||Bhojpur boy questions mountain visibility concept of British experts||Patna: A 17-year-old class XII student, Arnav Aditya Singh of Bhojpur district, has challenged the centuries old concept of Britishers on the visibility of mountain peaks from long distances. His work has been accepted for publication in the American Journal of Physics.During the nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, there were several reported sightings of Himalayan peaks from the vast Indo-Gangetic plains of north India, such as the Dhauladhar Range from Jalandhar and the eastern Himalayas from Purnea and Motihari. These reports reminded Arnav and his mentor Vijay Singh, who is also the president of Indian Association of Physics Teachers (IAPT), of similar sightings two centuries ago by orientalist and founder of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Sir William Jones.Jones had claimed that after sunset on October 5, 1784, he had a distinct view from Bhagalpur of the peak of Mt Jomolhari in Bhutan. The horizontal distance at which it was distinctly visible must be at least 244 British miles (390km). Those days, Bhagalpur was a British stronghold some 330km northwest of Kolkata. A decade later, in the 1790s, similar sightings of Mt Jomolhari and some other Himalayan peaks were reported by Henry Colebrooke from the town of Purnea, 80km northeast of Bhagalpur and thus closer to the Himalayan range. Colebrooke had succeeded Sir Jones as the Asiatic Society of Bengal president.Both Arnav and his mentor, also from Bihar, argued that as the earth is round, distant objects will be obstructed from view by its curvature or bulge. If one climbs atop a minaret or a hill, one can see farther. They claimed that the maximum distance one can see from the peak of 7326-metre high Mt Jomolhari is 216km. This is far short of the distance of 390km between the peak and Bhagalpur. This is surprising that the 1784 observation of Sir Jones has been quoted often and most recently in a popular book of John Keay, the ‘Great Arc’, they said. Another factor pointed out by Arnav and Singh is the visibility problem. They held that a distant object may not be visible on account of absorption by the intervening atmosphere. As early as in 1871, great scientist Sir Maxwell had asked if the Everest was visible from Darjeeling. Both Arnav and Singh found that the earlier claim of sighting Mt Jomolhari was not true. In all probability, it was Mt Kanchenjunga which was sighted by Sir Jones and others, they claimed. Both the mountains lie in the same direction from Bhagalpur and Mt Kanchenjunga is closer (297km) and taller (8,586m), they added. Arnav, who is studying at Kota and had won the gold medal at the International Junior Science Olympiad in Doha in 2019, said: “I want to study physics at Indian Institute of Science after completing my school education.”Singh, when contacted, told the newspaper that Arnav has very inquisitive mind and he would do wonders as a researcher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bhojpur-boy-questions-mountain-visibility-concept-of-british-experts/articleshow/81621180.cms||B K Mishra

---||Dehradun||Rising Covid cases: Hoteliers in Nainital and Ramnagar say it is yet to impact tourist enthusiasm for the upcoming Holi weekend, Mussoorie hoteliers say rumours of lockdown have impacted business||Nainital/Mussoorie: Even as the country is witnessing a surge in Covid-19 infections, hoteliers in Nainital and Ramnagar say that the hotels are almost packed for the Holi weekend. The hoteliers, however, add that some of the tourists have raised queries if the fresh surge in Covid-19 cases will lead to restrictions on movement of people. Speaking to TOI, Hari Mann, president of Ramnagar Hotels Association, said that almost all the hotels in Corbett are full for the Holi weekend. “This is the first time we have recorded this high tourist numbers since the outbreak of Covid-19,” Mann said. The hoteliers of Nainital also maintained that they are witnessing decent pre-booking numbers. “Going by the bookings, hotels in Nainital will run at maximum occupancy during the Holi weekend at the end of the month,” said Ved Sah, secretary, Nainital Hotels and Restaurant Association. Nonetheless, the hoteliers remain concerned in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases. “We fear that if the Covid-19 cases keep rising like this, the local administration might impose some restrictions. Such measures may prove detrimental for our business,” Mann added. On the other hand, hoteliers in Mussoorie say that they had to bear the brunt of the fake news claiming that the local administration had imposed a lockdown in the Barlowganj locality last week. They add that the bookings are yet to pick up in the queen of hills. “Our business has dipped by as much as 80% due to the rumours. We fear that rising Covid-19 cases in the country would dampen chances of business revival in the days to come,” said Rajkumar Kanojia, joint secretary of Mussoorie Hotels Association. Local traders are also witnessing a similar dip in their sales for the past one week, said Jagjeet Kukreja, secretary of Mussoorie Traders’ Association. Meanwhile, the local administration is gearing up for the upcoming tourist season. “In view of the rising Covid-19 cases across the country, we are strictly imposing all the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Fines are being imposed on people being found without masks. Besides, the vaccination drive is also ongoing in full swing. Also, awareness drives are being carried out in the hill town,” said Manish Kumar, sub-divisional magistrate, Mussoorie.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rising-covid-cases-hoteliers-in-nainital-and-ramnagar-say-it-is-yet-to-impact-tourist-enthusiasm-for-the-upcoming-holi-weekend-mussoorie-hoteliers-say-rumours-of-lockdown-have-impacted-business/articleshow/81620407.cms||Prashant Jha

Talking to TOI, SP (city) Botrey Rohan Pramod said, “Both the suspects are from the victim’s village. While one of them was identified as Rahul, 18, the other was 15-year-old. He will be sent to juvenile home after being produced before its board.” The post-mortem report confirmed rape. It mentioned the cause of death as “smothering”, said police. According to police, the accused, Rahul, worked as a daily-wage worker for the victim’s father. He also used to visit her home. Later, he was sacked over some issue and was also beaten up. He might have acted in vengeance, sources said. But police have yet not confirmed it. The alleged incident took place on Friday afternoon, when the girl had gone out to relieve herself. Rahul, who was already present there, dragged her to a nearby forest after gagging her with a piece of cloth. Both the accused then raped the girl. Police said that the girl may have died due to suffocation as she was gagged by the accused. They threw her body in a pond and fled. The accused were booked under IPC section 302 (murder), 376-D (gang-rape) and 201 (disappearance of evidence).

---||Delhi||After 2-year battle, UK agrees to extradite kingpin of drugs cartel||NEW DELHI: In a significant diplomatic victory, the United Kingdom has reportedly allowed the extradition of a high-value target to India after a two-year legal battle. Highly placed intelligence sources have confirmed to TOI that Kishan Singh, the kingpin of an international drugs syndicate, is being sent to India. It is learnt that a special team from India is currently in London for the extradition. This is the second significant handover by the UK within a year. Last February, Sanjeev Chawla, a bookie and key accused in one of cricket's biggest match-fixing scandals that involved former South African captain Hansie Cronje, was extradited through Delhi Police. The latest extradition has occurred within a month of a London court ruling that fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi could be sent back to India in connection with the Punjab National Bank scam. Modi faces charges of fraud, money laundering, alleged intimidation of witnesses and disappearance of evidence. Apart from him, the UK is expected to soon extradite liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who is accused of loan default of Rs 9,000 crore involving his defunct Kingfisher Airlines. He has been in the UK since 2016. Kishan Singh’s syndicate was busted by Special Cell of Delhi Police in 2017. A discus thrower, Harpreet Singh, a silver medallist in the 2004 Australia Commonwealth Youth Games, was arrested along with two accomplices, Amandeep and Harnish, and 25kg of party drugs worth Rs 50 crore were seized from them. The contraband, Mephedrone, also called Meow Meow, was meant to be sold at rave parties in Mumbai and Delhi. The trio was employed by Kishan, a native of Rajasthan. Harnish had earlier gone to London on a student visa to do MBA. He met Kishan while working there. Influenced by Kishan’s lavish lifestyle, they joined him in his drug peddling business. Kishan wanted to extend his syndicate across international borders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-2-year-battle-uk-agrees-to-extradite-kingpin-of-drugs-cartel/articleshow/81621179.cms||Raj Shekhar

Earlier, the schools were allowed to charge only the tuition fees since they were only providing online classes.

According to the order, the private schools are allowed to charge the full fee amount only from the date of their reopening for offline classes.

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur water supply dept proposes tax hike||Kolhapur: The water supply department of the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has proposed a hike in water tax rates — 10% to 20% for domestic consumers and 15% for commercial and industrial consumers. The current water tax for domestic consumers is Rs 9.50 per kilo litre (kl) for 0 to 20kl consumption followed by Rs 11.50 for 20kl to 40k and Rs 15 for consumption of above 40kl. For commercial and industrial consumers, the charges are Rs 40/litre and Rs 65/litre respectively for every kl consumption. One kl is equivalent to 1,000 litre and most of the small families fall in this category. As per the new proposal, there will be no hike for domestic consumers with consumption between 0 and 20 kl, for subsequent slabs — 20 kl to 40 kl and above 40 kl the hike will be 10% and 20% respectively. The proposal has been sent to civic administrator Kadambari Balkawade who is expected to take a final call before releasing the KMC budget for the financial year 2021-22. If approved, it will for the first time in last seven years that there will be hike in water tax rates. A proposal to hike tax rates up to 30% were submitted earlier, but it was turned down by the corporators before the budget was approved in the general body meeting. Now, since the civic body stands abolished there will be no process of holding a general body meeting and therefore Balkawade is the sole authority to take final call on the departmental proposals. Prashant Pandit, chief water tax superintendent of the KMC, agreed that such proposal has been tabled and said, “As departmental head I expect that the proposal is approved. The expenses pertaining to maintenance, repairs of the pipelines, motors and electricity bills have been increased several times since last seven years. This is the reason we have put up the proposal again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-water-supply-dept-proposes-tax-hike/articleshow/81619122.cms||---

The accused has been identified as Neelam Gupta from Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh. The incident took place in outer Delhi’s Budh Vihar. On Saturday, police received information about a child going missing and launched a manhunt. While searching the child’s neighbourhood, the cops came across a white bag on the roof of the house adjacent to the victim’s. “The placement of the bag was quite suspicious, so the cops opened the bag and found the body of the child in it. The body had injury marks on his neck and prima facie, the child seemed to have been strangulated to death,” DCP (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said. A murder FIR was registered. The child’s family, relatives and neighbours were also questioned. Police discovered that the child was last seen with a neighbour Neelam. During questioning, Neelam allegedly tried to mislead police and gave contradictory statements. She later confessed to the crime on sustained questioning. The accused told police that she got married in 2013 and had unsuccessfully tried to be a mother ever since. “She claimed that she was under a lot of pressure to conceive from her in-laws and society. Therefore, she approached an occultist in Hardoi who suggested that she sacrifice a child in order to conceive,” the DCP said. In her desperation to be a mother, she decided to kill her neighbour’s three-year-old child. On Saturday, the accused spotted the child alone on the roof of the building where the families stayed, police said. She took the child in the absence of family members and strangled him, before putting his body in the bag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-kidnaps-kills-3-year-old-kid-as-part-of-an-occult-exercise/articleshow/81621185.cms||---

According to the federation, girl child labourers were being employed in large numbers in most of the industries listed out by them. Several of them were vulnerable to occupational hazards and health issues including urinary tract infection problems caused by the nature of the work. Other issues like job insecurity, excessive working hours and low income are also prevalent in these units.

I have become very old to conduct probes against controversial politicians. Pawar himself is the best for the job, why is he involving me in such murky cases,” Ribeiro told TOI. Pawar had told media persons in New Delhi that he would recommend Ribeiro’s name to conduct an impartial inquiry against Deshmukh. Apparently, before announcing Ribeiro’s name, neither Pawar nor any of the NCP cabinet members in the state had sought his consent. “I have crossed 92 and NCP expects me to conduct a probe, not acceptable,” he said. An agitated Ribeiro said he had been fielding calls from media houses the entire day. “Instead of Ribeiro, Pawar should have appointed a sitting or retired judge of Bombay HC. But, before that Pawar must sack the home minister,” a senior IPS officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-involve-me-in-such-murky-cases-ex-police-chief/articleshow/81623391.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar
---||Dehradun||Honey-based start-ups taste sweet success||Dehradun: For a group of friends working in the IT industry, a common passion for honey brought them together to start an initiative during the nationwide lockdown last year. A few months on, their start-up BeeReady Harvesters, which focuses on honey of different flavours like ajwain, neem and acacia, is finding favour with an expanding customer base across the country. Shubham Rana, director at BeeReady, told TOI, “I worked for five years for a company involved in import and export of honey and my experience came handy when we thought about starting our own venture to promote scientific beekeeping and create awareness about natural honey.” According to Snehal Ashok, Shubham Rawat and Prithvi Singh, the other three partners in the venture, they are deriving satisfaction by working with women self-help groups in villages in the hills. “Besides honey of varied flavours, we are also focussing on products made from bee wax like candles for which we are involving women villagers. When people think of beekeeping, it is usually about honey but there are many other things that bees provide like bee pollen, venom and propolis which are used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry. We are trying to spread awareness about these as well.” With the role of honey in boosting immunity being highlighted during the pandemic, some start-ups saw a boost in their operations. “Before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country, we gave most of our honey samples to our friends and family. But during the lockdown, we started selling it commercially as there was more awareness and demand of honey due to its immunity-boosting properties,” said Pankaj Tyagi from Le Gardenia Wellness, another Dehradun-based start-up. The firm, which claims to now sell around 200 kg of honey every month, offers over a dozen floral varieties of the product. Madhuka Naturelle, another honey-based start-up in Doon, began in 2019, but actively started promoting raw honey during the lockdown. Sudhanshu Malhotra, who owns the venture, said, “I left my corporate job to pursue my dream of beekeeping. During the peak time of Covid-19 spread, the entire country started talking about improving immunity and that’s when we started promoting our honey and helping people know the difference between processed honey and raw honey.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/honey-based-start-ups-taste-sweet-success/articleshow/81620427.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The pastoral epistle read out in its parishes pointed out that the state government had tried to sell out the sea in a covert manner. The government had to withdraw from the contract it had signed with the EMCC company following strong protest. The government’s enactment of a legislation was aimed at stealing the sea and marine resources from the fisher folk, the epistle said. “The government’s attempts were to destroy fisheries sector in the name of tourism and development. We should fight against such government policies unitedly,” the pastoral letter said. The letter was again critical of including the fishermen’s housing scheme under the Life Mission scheme, causing the fishermen to lose the additional advantage. The letter also pointed out that the government had amended the Kerala Marine Fisheries Regulation Act of 1980 in 2018. On September 24, 2020 an ordinance was issued on fish auction and quality maintenance without making any efforts for consultation with the stake holders. The letter was also critical of the central government’s granting approval for mining in sea under the blue economy project. It has alleged that Kerala’s own ‘army” was being pushed down to the sea of neglect. The pastoral letter was read out by parish priests in all its churches under the diocese. Hundreds of parishioners who participated in the holy mass expressed concern over the move to destroy the livelihood of the fisher folk on the Kerala coast. Kerala Latin Christian Association (KLCA) also has taken up the issue for discussion. However, it may be noted that neither the Kollam Bishop nor the parish priests have tried to link the issue with the upcoming elections. During the elections, the Church leaders many a time had come out with reading pastoral letters on various issues with emphasis on favouring particular candidates or political party. This time, it has expressed only its apprehensions about the government policies and the need for the faithful to maintain vigil against attempts to destroy their livelihood. The Latin Church’s stand is important as it can impact the poll outcome in some of the constituencies bordering the coastline. In the constituencies like Kundara, Kollam, Iravipuram, Chavara, Karunagappally and Chathannur the stance of the fisher folk and Latin Church will have a considerable effect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/latin-church-blasts-centre-state-for-bid-to-destroy-fisheries-sector/articleshow/81621187.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Waze had asked Mansukh to take responsibility for planting the explosives but he refused, officials said. There are two theories regarding Waze’s reasons for fabricating a terror case. “Waze would crack the case and become a super cop. Or he and some other cops including a senior officer were hoping to get into a private security firm being launched by a corporate,” said an official. Investigations suggest Waze eliminated Mansukh because he feared the latter would succumb to pressure and disclose the plan. The plot was hatched on March 2 during a two-hour meeting Waze held with two colleagues at their headquarters near Crawford Market. The same day Waze asked Mansukh to draft a letter through an advocate alleging he was under pressure from police and the media, which was not the case. Waze’s phone records have established his location near the Ambani residence on the fateful night, an officer said. To build an alibi, he ensured he did not receive or make calls from his personal phone on March 4, the day of the murder, the ATS told the Thane court.There were only 8 messages on his mobile though it was not switched off. All communication with accomplices were through SIM cards procured from Gujarat. To strengthen his defence, Waze stayed put at Dongri carrying out searches on hotels till late at night on March 4.  The accused policemen and a few individuals from Thane, who are yet to be arrested, are alleged to have lent logistical support in luring Mansukh to Ghodbunder Road before attacking him in a moving car and dumping his body in Mumbra creek. The diatom report indicated Mansukh was alive when he was flung in the creek. “The killers wanted to show that Mansukh committed suicide but things got out of hand, they left digital footprints like the phone call he received at 8.20pm on March 4, prompting him to step out of the house,” said a source. On Saturday, the government announced the transfer of the case to the NIA. The ATS is yet to receive the order. It may reach ATS on Monday, by which time it is likely to announce another breakthrough. The team led by Jaijeet Singh has additional commissioner Shivdeep Lande, DCP Rajkumar Shinde, ACP Shripad Kale, senior inspector Daya Nayak and Dhole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiwaze-built-an-alibi-stayed-in-touch-with-killers-tried-to-hide-digital-trail/articleshow/81621783.cms||Mateen Hafeez

A few family events have postponed at the nick of the moment citing Covid-19 spread, and the event organisers and wedding hall owners brace for another blow. After about three months, Covid-19 cases are increasing to surpass 1,000 cases per day. In Trichy, fresh infections increased from six cases on March 17 to 11 cases on March 19. As the cases are increasing, families that have planned weddings and other events are hesitant to go ahead with their plans. Event organisers said that there is an uncertainty in planning family events. Since the events attract senior citizens who are vulnerable to contract the infections, many people are postponing weddings. “Rumours are highly impacting our business. People think that the government may announce a lockdown, two of my clients have postponed weddings that are planned for the next two weeks,” S Arockia Paulraj, an event organiser in Trichy, said. The model code of conduct is also adding fuel to the fire. As the movement of cash and jewellery is under the scanner for which many people do not have adequate documents, they prefer to conduct the events after the election. “Families are avoiding big halls, and are trying to restrict guests and spending. In the past two months, people resumed organizing weddings. Yet again, the spike in Covid-19 cases is letting us down,” Raghuram Nallathambi, a wedding planner, said. Trichy Corporation sources said that the conduct of weddings was not much scrutinised nowadays, but they added that funerals and weddings play a major role in spreading the infections. “People have stopped making enquiries to book halls in advance as fresh infections are increasing,” a manager of a wedding hall in Trichy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/covid-surge-begins-to-impact-wedding-plans-family-events/articleshow/81621191.cms||Deepak Karthik

The state home minister himself has demanded an inquiry into the allegations made against him,” Raut said.“During the last 72 hours, a letter and a police officer have tarnished the image of the government. These are painful developments and each one of the MVA constituents must introspect and make efforts to improve the coalition’s image,” he saidWhen asked about Singh, the MP said Paramnir Singh is a ‘good police officer’. “I will only say that he had relinquished his charge due to some specific reasons,” Raut said. While the chief minister has been doing a good job, the government needs to keep eye on its officers, he said. “I have been alerting the government through editorials in ‘Saamana’ to keep a tight leash on the officers. I think now the government will act on it,” Raut added.He will be travelling to Delhi to meet Pawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/senas-sanjay-raut-calls-for-introspection-by-mva-partners/articleshow/81619146.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The NSUI members told TOI that the protest was being carried out against the rising unemployment and poor education infrastructure. “The government hasn’t fulfilled its promises related to the youths and the education infrastructure. They haven’t filled the vacant teaching posts across the colleges due to which the students are suffering. Prior to the 2017 state election, they had promised that the vacant posts for teachers in the degree colleges will be filled within six months,” said Mohan Bhandari, state president of NSUI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nsui-ukhand-protests-against-unemployment-in-doon/articleshow/81620438.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Nashik||BJP demands home minister’s resignation||Nashik/Aurangabad: Former police commissioner Parambir Singh’s claim — that Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh had allegedly set a target of accumulating Rs 100 crore per month — prompted protests and calls for Deshmukh’s resignation. The Nashik city unit of the BJP staged a protest at the Ravivar Karanja area demanding Deshmukh's ouster and sought a full-fledged inquiry into the matter. “As per the senior serving officer’s allegations, the demand made by the home minister is nothing short of extortion. Should such a minister be allowed to remain in power?” asked the BJP functionaries, including corporator Himgauri Adke. “The government should dismiss the home minister on moral grounds,” said Adke. The BJP will be agitating as long as the government fails to take action. It should reveal the truth behind the alleged Rs 100 crore demand, the protesters said. The Panchavati police maintained a bandobast to ensure that people limited themselves to the agitation and did not resort to a raasta roko. In Aurangabad too, despite ban on political assemblies, the local unit of the BJP staged a protest. BJP MLA Atul Save said this was first time in the state’s history that a serving senior police officer has exposed the malpractices of a home minister. “The incident has tarnished the image of Maharashtra. The home minister must resign to facilitate a fair and transparent inquiry,” he said. Referring to the Mansukh Hiren death case, Save said the MVA government does not only have a extortionist mindset but also an instinct to eliminate those who come in the way of corrupt practices. “All three parties that are the constituents of the MVA government are responsible for tarnishing the reputation of Maharashtra. People will never forget the sins of this government,” he said. Similar protests were also reported at different taluka places and district headquarters in Marathwada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bjp-demands-home-ministers-resignation/articleshow/81619140.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Cop, bookie held for Mansukh Hiran’s murder ‘ordered by Sachin Waze’||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) on Sunday arrested a convicted cop out on parole and a bookie for the alleged murder of Mansukh Hiran whose Scorpio was found laden with explosive near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25. The arrested have been identified as Vinayak Shinde (55), a constable convicted for the fake encounter of Chhota Rajan associate Ram Lakhan Bhaiya in 2007, and Naresh Ramniklal Gore (31), a bookie. Shinde, on parole since May 2020, worked with Sachin Waze in a team led by retired encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma. ATS suspects more policemen are involved in the killing prompted by Mansukh’s reluctance to take the rap for planting the explosives. Waze is alleged to have ordered the hit but may not have been present when Mansukh was murdered. The digital trail left by Waze and others in communicating with Mansukh and each other helped ATS to nail the suspects. Gore and Shinde were produced before the Thane ATS court, which remanded them in police custody till March 30. ATS chief Jaijeet Singh said bookie Gore had procured five SIM cards and handed them to Shinde who was in touch with Waze since his release on parole. These arrests are merely the tip of the iceberg, said an official, adding that more suspects, mostly cops, will be apprehended in a day or two. The two accused have not only admitted to their role but also spilled the beans on Waze and a few more cops who extended logistics support, the official said. Waze had asked Mansukh to take responsibility for planting the explosives but he refused, officials said. There are two theories regarding Waze’s reasons for fabricating a terror case. “Waze would crack the case and become a super cop. Or he and some other cops including a senior officer were hoping to get into a private security firm being launched by a corporate,” said an official. Preliminary investigations suggest Waze eliminated Mansukh because he feared the latter would succumb to pressure and disclose the plan. The plot to kill Mansukh was hatched on March 2 during a two-hour meeting Waze held with two colleagues at their headquarters near Crawford Market. It was the same day Waze asked Mansukh to draft a letter through an advocate alleging he was under pressure from police and the media, which was not the case. Waze’s phone records have established his location near the Ambani residence on the fateful night, an officer said. To build an alibi, he ensured that he did not receive or make any calls from his personal phone on March 4, the day of the murder, the ATS has told the Thane court. In fact, there were only 8 messages on his mobile even though it was not switched off. All communication with accomplices were through SIM cards procured from Gujarat. To strengthen his defence, Waze stayed put at Dongri carrying out searches on hotels till late at night on March 4. The effort to erase evidence, in fact, began much before. A day after the car was found near the Ambani house, four men from Waze’s team visited Mansukh’s shop in Thane and took away the digital video recorder linked to his CCTV and installed a new one in its place. Sources said though Waze himself did not take part in killing Mansukh, he was coordinating with the killers and a few cops over the phone. The accused policemen and a few individuals from Thane, who are yet to be arrested, are alleged to have lent logistical support in luring Mansukh to Ghodbunder Road in Thane before attacking him in a moving car and then dumping his body in the Mumbra creek. The prima facie diatom report has indicated that Mansukh was alive when he was thrown in the creek. “The killers wanted to show that Mansukh committed suicide but things got out of hand, they left digital footprints like the phone call he received at 8.20pm on March 4, prompting him to step out of the house. He is suspected to have been assaulted in a moving car and his body dumped in the Mumbra creek,” said a source. On Saturday, the government announced the transfer of the case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The state ATS is yet to receive the order. It may reach ATS on Monday, by which time it is likely to announce another breakthrough in investigations. The team led by Jaijeet Singh, additional commissioner Shivdeep Lande, deputy commissioner Rajkumar Shinde, ACP Shripad Kale, senior inspector Daya Nayak and Dhole have been investigating the case for the last one week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cop-bookie-held-for-hirans-murder-ordered-by-waze/articleshow/81622471.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Kozhikode||Overconfidence of coalitions in Kerala||On the eve of the elections in Kerala, one feature that characterizes all political leaders is overconfidence. It is common practice for politicians down the ages to express optimism about victory even when they know that they are down in the doldrums. But here, the overconfidence makes them say and do things without being aware of the dangers lurking around them. Kerala has a healthy tradition of bringing the two coalitions to power by turns so that each can spend half their term to undo what its predecessor had done and the other half to make their own mistakes. This disproves the theory that Kerala is a politically polarized state. There is obviously a swing group which remembers the evils of the previous government and votes for a change in the fond hope that the other side may deliver better. Consequently, the progress of the state is stalled. This time, the incumbent LDF government is confident that it will continue despite a battalion of scandals, corruption charges, allegations of anti-national activities in collusion with a foreign country and mishandling of sensitive issues, which should normally have brought the government down even before it completed its term. The campaign slogan of the coalition is that “return is certain.” Not only that, the latest opinion polls by different agencies and TV channels indicate that continuity is possible. Unsurprisingly, the ruling coalition bristles with overconfidence. The main opposition coalition, UDF, of which Congress is the leading partner is no less confident, as it believes that it is the only viable alternative for Kerala, even though not a day passes without defiance of the state and central leaderships on the selection of candidates. The release of the list of candidates in the name of the High Command culminated in a tonsure by a spirited lady leader. The coalition is expecting to return to power on the strength of the number of cases raised by it to discredit the ruling coalition. Muslim League, a component of UDF, has quietly planned things in advance, expanded the number of seats and announced its candidates. Normally, announcements by the supreme head of the party is never challenged by the party, but this time the candidate selection was questioned by some. The overconfidence of NDA is a true mystery as a wave in its favour is not in evidence. Metroman E Sreedharan has much to be confident about and he naturally expresses that confidence in modest terms. One swallow does not make a summer. He should have brought in some like-minded and capable people into the fray. The reality does not match the aspirations as of now. Hope the Metroman, with his outstanding credentials, will be in the Rashtrapati Bhavan a la Dr APJ Abdul Kalam one day. The confidence of parties has engendered a phenomenon this time, which can be characterized as “localitis”. The political parties have always been suspicious of “imported” candidates as they have their own hierarchy based on working at the grass roots levels. The recent experience of fortune seekers entering politics at high levels has led to extreme caution. This time the “localitis” became so acute that some good people became victims of this prejudice. The tragic flaw of overconfidence makes any prediction difficult and pollsters are waiting for the completion of the flow of “prominent” people from one coalition to another even at the last minute, believing that even a week is a long time in politics. The only prediction that can be made at this time is that there will be many surprises when the voting machines deliver the results.

---||Delhi||LG vs Delhi govt governance: AAP dares BJP for debate||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) chief spokesperson and MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj on Sunday challenged the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president Adesh Gupta to openly debate on how lieutenant governor’s governance is better in any assembly constituency in Delhi and AAP will explain to people how an elected government is better. However, BJP said that it has never said that LG’s rule is better than the elected government’s rule. “The Centre is trying to bring a new law by completely bypassing the elected government of Delhi. Jan Sangh has fought to make Delhi a separate state for years after Independence. We believed that at least the Delhi unit of BJP that came out of the same Jan Sangh would understand the seriousness of this matter,” Bhardwaj said at a press conference. “The Centre is taking away all the rights of the elected government of Delhi — the same government whom people have chosen to give 62 out of 70 seats is being crippled,” he said. “It is shameless that Delhi BJP is plotting to go from door to door to convince the people of Delhi about the benefits of LG’s rule in the capital,” Bhardwaj claimed. Bhardwaj challenged Gupta to choose a constituency of his choice in Delhi and send BJP volunteers from house to house to explain to them how the rule of LG is better than the Arvind Kejriwal government. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, meanwhile, said: “All we feel and believe is that any government, any administration will be better for Delhi than the present AAP government, which has stalled the development of the city.” “Today Delhi has no properly elected government on basis of a manifesto or development commitment. Truth is that Kejriwal has manipulated electoral victory through politics of freebies and communal divide,” he alleged. “We challenge Kejriwal to fight one election against BJP on the issue of development of Delhi and see the result where he will be ousted from power,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lg-vs-delhi-govt-governance-aap-dares-bjp-for-debate/articleshow/81621196.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Of the 97 nominations filed, 13 were rejected and the remaining 84 accepted by the election commission after scrutiny. Observers say that most of the 73 independent candidates who filed nominations are not genuine and were fielded by the two major parties in the fray. “While Karur is set for high voltage encounter between transport minister M R Vijayabhaskar of AIADMK and DMK Karur in-charge V Senthil Balaji, they both want more number of their supporters as counting agents inside the counting hall,” said a senior functionary of a political party in Karur. While each candidate in the fray is allowed to have his counting agent inside the hall, major contenders make use of the opportunity to field their candidates. This is basically to keep track of the counting as they both suspect each other of indulging in malpractice during the counting, said the functionary. Last time too, as many as 95 applications were accepted in the constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/73-of-84-candidates-in-karur-are-independents/articleshow/81621194.cms||---

The police arrested the suspects — Faiyaz Mansuri (24) and Prem Sagar Mahesh Ram (21) — after keeping a watch on them for five days. They were presented before the court that remanded them in police custody until Monday. Last month, a case of cheating was registered with the cyber police station wherein the bank was allegedly duped of Rs 18.79 lakh by an imposter claiming to be one of its preferred clients. The suspect had made a call to the bank and with the help of some forged documents asked the bank to transfer the money from the bank account of the concerned customer to two other accounts on February 4 and 5. The conman imposing as the bank’s preferred customer had also said that an email about the money transfer would also be sent by him which was a common practice of the bank and the preferred customer. The bank claimed that they received an email from the office of the client with the request of a cheque book and immediate transfer of funds from the account to two separate accounts. Subsequently, the original customer came to know about the fraud and approached the bank and eventually a complaing was lodged with the police. Subsequently, a police team led by inspector Devraj Borse left for Gopalganj in Bihar where they traced and arrested the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/2-held-from-bihar-for-duping-bank-of-rs-18-8l/articleshow/81619151.cms||---

The BJP could win that election with the support of the Congress votes,” he said. Pillai was with the JD(U) headed by late M P Veerendra Kumar and had contested in the UDF ticket. Now, Surendran Pillai is with the LDF. He said the KPCC had conducted an inquiry into the considerable vote erosion for the UDF candidate then. The inquiry commission had pointed out the lapses on the part of five Congress leaders in the constituency. However, no action was taken against these leaders. “I am keenly observing the UDF right from 1984 onwards. When I had approached a prominent person to file his nomination from Nemom earlier, he refused to do it. But the UDF had emerged stronger later here. That was how I decided to contest from Nemom last time. The UDF always gives this seat to the constituents and the Congress later engage in vote trading,” Pillai said. “In return, Congress gets the benefits in other seats. That is the deal they struck with them. O Rajagopal himself had said that vote sale took place in Nemom. The present UDF candidate in Nemom should be very careful. I hope K Muraleedharan knows all these,” he added. He also alleged that some Congress leaders in the constituency were behind the sale of votes. When a triangular contest is being witnessed in the constituency, LDF candidate V Sivankutty stands to gain, said the former MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/surendran-pillai-alleges-vote-trade-in-nemom/articleshow/81621197.cms||---

Residents say hawkers have taken over footpaths. And at many places, vehicles can be seen double-parked in front of businesses. Pedestrians say walking here has become extremely risky. “My son was recently bitten by a dog while he was on his way to a store. A few days ago, a senior citizen was also bitten,” says Shubhashree Tanksale, a local resident. She says there are many elderly who are simply unable to step out. “The stray dogs and illegally-parked cars have made walking scary for many senior citizens.” Deepak Kshotre, a resident of Sus Road, says it has been over a year since some bus stops were replaced with temporary structures. “From builders to telecom operators to piped gas distributors, the footpath here is always in a state of disrepair. Illegal vendors are another problem and it is impossible to walk even by the roadside. There are eateries that do not provide parking facility.” Illegal parking is affecting housing societies too. Residents of Mont Vert Arcade, for instance, say their entrance and exits are often blocked by parked cars. PMC officials say while there are designated hawker zones on Sus Road, pressure from political groups stops them from taking any action. “Hawking is allowed, if you have a license and are selling at a designated spot. We do confiscate material, but here is huge political pressure on us to let rule-breakers go,” one official said. Another PMC official refuted claims of political pressure, adding that hawkers often return to spots despite fines. “There are two designated zones in the area. We encourage people to complain via the PMC app so that we know the spots where illegal hawking is on,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/near-sus-road-scores-seek-respite-from-illegal-parking-congestion/articleshow/81620447.cms||Ardhra Nair

She has duped at least two women from Mumbai’s western suburbs, the police said. The accused, Shahidabibi Khan, would target women in their 70s and convince them about her “contacts in government departments”. She would take them to a government office and advise them to take off all ornaments before meeting officials, as it would “help them get their money sooner”. Khan would offer to look after the ornaments till the work was completed, but would flee. On March 19, she convinced a senior citizen that she could get help her pension money. She took the woman to a commercial building in Goregaon. She ended up fleeing with the elderly woman’s ornaments. Khan then targetted another senior citizen and brought her along to Goregaon where she made off with her ornaments as well. After a police complaint was lodged, cops checked CCTV footage of the area, and found Khan’s images. On inquiring further, they learnt that she lived in Anand, Gujarat and had been arrested there in another case. They took Khan’s custody and brought her to Mumbai. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiguj-woman-who-duped-elderly-held/articleshow/81622473.cms||---
---||Delhi||At executive meet of Delhi BJP, Rajnath Singh says AAP govt is stalling central projects||NEW DELHI: Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member and defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday told the Delhi unit of the party to deploy ‘panna pramukhs’ across Delhi, as they are its biggest strength. Singh was addressing a two-day executive meeting of Delhi BJP in west Delhi’s Mazra Dabas, where he also claimed that it was regrettable that the Arvind Kejriwal government has stalled implementation of many central government schemes. “Panna pramukhs should be deployed in Delhi. I think it is the most important post and the biggest strength of the party... I can say it with conviction it can make BJP win here,” he said. Singh said that a panna pramukh, who is the first point of contact for most voters in BJP’s election management machinery, is more important than th president of the party’s state unit and should be honoured. Singh’s comment comes at a time when Delhi BJP is gearing up for the municipal corporation polls scheduled to be held next year. BJP is in power in all the three municipal corporations of Delhi but in the recently held by-polls in five municipal wards, BJP failed to win any seat. Singh also claimed it was regrettable that the Kejriwal government in Delhi has stalled implementation of Ayushman Bharat, Pradhanmantri Awaas yojna, Ujjawala yojana, Mudra yojana and many other central schemes thereby depriving lakhs of Delhiites from their benefits and asked the party workers to launch an awareness campaign about this. Despite attempts, Aam Aadmi Party could not be reached for comments. Sharing his own experience with workers while inaugurating the meeting, Singh said from the Jan Sangh days, Delhi has been his work field because “it’s here that the Jan Sangh and then BJP was formed.” Singh said that the Narendra Modi government is working on Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya’s principle of welfare of humanity and hence it is working towards ensuring all sections of the society get benefits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-exec-meet-of-delhi-bjp-rajnath-says-delhi-govt-is-stalling-central-projects/articleshow/81621210.cms||---

SPPU Oxy-park, SPPU Heritage Park, SPPU Sports Club are some initiatives to be undertaken by the university . People in the vicinity has been using the 400 acres of green luxury for free, but now the university plans to put up a paywall. “SPPU Oxy-park would be like a club membership. The timings will be decided and only members can enter the campus.

This will ensure that we have a tab on who is entering the university and will generate income,” Rajesh Pande, management council member of the university, said. The university is a Grade 1 heritage structure and there are many interesting and historically important places as well as artefacts in it. Hence, plans are to start the heritage walk proposed some years ago. “The university is building a world-class sports complex with an Olympic grade running track, shooting range, indoor stadium and a tennis court. We plan to start a sports club membership for outsiders. This will ensure complete utilisation of the resources and would also be beneficial to the people,” Pande added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sppu-set-to-charge-visitors-for-facilities-green-expanse/articleshow/81620459.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Pune||Indian researchers join global effort to track g waves from giant black holes||Pune: A consortium of mainly Indian researchers under the banner of Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA), became a full member of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) to discover and study very low-frequency gravitational waves from supermassive binary black holes orbiting each other. InPTA regularly employs the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) near Pune to monitor pulsars to obtain high precision timing measurements. The unique frequency range of the uGMRT, 300-800 MHz is not covered by other big telescopes used by IPTA. Therefore, the inclusion of uGMRT is crucial in improving the precision of IPTA to detect nano-hertz GWs.The largest telescopes in the world are routinely being used by IPTA to precisely measure the clock periods of a collection of these pulsars. This, in turn, allows one to identify changes in periods caused by the passage of a gravitational wave. When discovered, these waves will refine evolutionary models of our universe as well as masses and orbits of members of our own solar system and open a new window of GW astronomy.B C Joshi, senior professor at NCRA-TIFR, said, “The inclusion of uGMRT will allow removing the delays introduced by the interstellar medium in the arrival of radio pulses from these galactic clocks by a factor of five more precisely than before. InPTA and uGMRT will play significant roles in the detection of nano-hertz GWs and gravitational astronomy in future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/indian-researchers-join-global-effort-to-track-g-waves-from-giant-black-holes/articleshow/81620469.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Pre-poll surveys baseless, biased, says Chennithala||T’puram: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has come out strongly against the media surveys which predict continuity for the LDF government. He was also irate over the findings that he has got a very poor rating as the chief minister candidate. “There is a calculated attempt to destroy the UDF and also to target me. All the surveys have predicted that LDF will continue. All these surveys are totally baseless and are biased ones,” said Chennithala. “The media have been actively campaigning against the UDF. The government has been influencing the media by giving advertisements worth crores of rupees and hence the media have been involved in praising the works of the government. The government has so far spent Rs 200 crore for advertisements through media and Rs 57 crore was spent by the KIIFB,” he said. The opposition leader said that the media had forgotten the fact that the LDF government had to withdraw all the controversial decisions which were revealed by the opposition before the people. “But the surveys are predicting that it will not have any impact in the election. It is also interesting to note that the same company has done the survey for three media houses,” he said, adding that the LDF government was giving advertisements in the newspapers being published in Gujarat. He also recalled the surveys conducted during the last Lok Sabha elections, which had predicted an LDF win in majority of the seats. But when the results came, UDF won 19 seats. “The surveys had predicted a seat for the BJP in the Lok Sabha poll. Everyone knows what had happened later,” said Chennithala.  “In Palakkad, the survey had predicted victory for M B Rajesh of the CPM. What was the result? This is the authenticity of the surveys,” he said. Chennithala said during the last assembly election, the surveys had said only 2% of the people preferred Pinarayi Vijayan as the chief minister. “All the surveys are being done using limited samples and they cannot be taken as the mass opinion. Only 1% of the total votes is covered during these surveys,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pre-poll-surveys-baseless-biased-says-chennithala/articleshow/81620473.cms||---

Justice V Parthiban said the Council of Architecture has granted approval for commencing MArch course in the petitioner college with a sanctioned intake of 20 students from 2018-19. After successfully conducting the course for two years, the college submitted its application for 2020-21 to the council for approval with details of the teaching faculty available on the strength of the department of architecture consisting of 11 professor/associate professor/assistant professor including full-time and visiting members. The council had issued showcause notice and subsequently passed an order reducing the intake from 20 to 10 on the ground that there is a major cadrewise core faculty deficit. Challenging the reduction of student intake, the college moved HC Madurai bench. Justice Parthiban observed that the scope of dispute in this petition is on a thin line whether the department suffered from lack of core faculty, namely, one full time professor. The judge said that HOD is a fulltime professor but has been designated as HOD. According to the council, the principal/HOD is not to be included in the ratio and therefore the norms of entitling the college to a full intake of 20 students is unacceptable. The judge observed that while HOD who has been engaged in teaching students and had been shown as a professor during the last two academic years, the court is unable to comprehend why this year alone the Council has adopted a preposterous stand in not accepting the HOD as a full time professor. The college had appointed one additional professor and submitted representations seeking approval for full intake of students, but none of the representations evoked any response. The judge observed that though such matters normally fall outside the pale of a judicial review, it finds that the action of the competent authority is arbitrary, irrational and unreasonable. Hence, he set aside the order of reduction in student intake and directed the council to grant approval for full intake of 20 students for the architectural course.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-okays-full-student-intake-for-m-arch/articleshow/81621198.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The party has attempted for a political space in the constituency where majority of voters are of Tamil origin. The TN model AIADMK-BJP alliance fielded two candidates in Idukki and Palakkad under NDA banner. As the nomination of the AIADMK candidate in Devikulam has been rejected, an independent candidate Ganeshan would be the new NDA candidate from the constituency. According to officials, Marimuthu’s nomination was rejected as she failed to complete the form 26. According to AIADMK party sources, the rejection of their candidate’s nomination will badly affect their plan to spread the party’s wings in the state. The party believed that AIADMK-BJP alliance could win the election. In 2016, Marimuthu had garnered 11,613 votes in Devikulam and was placed in third position. Speaking to TOI, Marimuthu said, “I have approached the high court at my own risk. My nomination was rejected by the returning officer without citing proper reason. Before submitting the nomination paper, officials had asked me to quit my job at anganwadi. When I did so, they informed me that they have rejected my nomination. Now, I stand jobless.” “I am sure that I can win the election if my nomination is accepted,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/aiadmkstn-model-plancomes-to-anend-in-idukkislug-devikulam/articleshow/81621378.cms||---

Now, it has dropped to around 8,000 per day,” Pune airport director Kuldeep Singh told TOI.The number of daily passengers has been on the decline for a few weeks. On March 19, the passenger traffic stood at a little over 8,400. The previous day, it was just over 7,000. Between March 1 and 19, close to 1.62 lakh passengers used the airport. The number stood at 2.04 lakh during the same period in February, and around 3 lakh through January.“The sudden spike in cases appears to have alarmed flyers. The number of daily flights is unchanged — around 80 — and I think passengers have become accustomed to the travel regulations in different states,” an airport official said.Sanjay Sharma was among those who put their travel plans on hold for this reason. “I was set to travel home to Delhi next week, but my family advised me to stay back till the cases are back under control,” Sharma said.Airport officials said they expected the situation to improve in April. “Summer holidays start and under the summer schedule, the airport will have new flights to fresh destinations, so we hope people travel again,” an official said.Dhairyashil Vandekar, an aviation expert, said controlling the surge would boost confidence among flyers. “Air travel is the first casualty due to the surge. Pune is among the worst-hit infected cities in the country. The onus is now on the authorities to control the spread,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-surge-hits-passenger-traffic-at-lohegaon-airport/articleshow/81620480.cms||Joy Sengupta

Maharashtra’s 30,535 was the fourth day in a row of over 25,000 cases. Almost mirroring the state’s growth, Mumbai added 3,779 cases, just over 200 short of 4,000 and second in five days when the count was over 3,000. Worryingly, the state’s Covid-19 daily mortality climbed to 99,the highest in 106 days. The state has added over 3.24 lakh cases this month, compared to 1.3 lakh and 92,177 cases in February and January. Mumbai has added 36,758 cases in March, double of 18,362 recorded in February and a 125% jump from January (16,310). Civic chief IS Chahal told TOI they were gearing up for 6,000 cases per day in the coming weeks. Civic chief IS Chahal told TOI: “The rise in cases is on expected lines and shouldn’t create any panic,” he said. “Testing has been going up. We are pushing it to 50,000 from the current daily average of 24,500 tests. The best way to control the spread is doubling testing and isolating positives.” Chahal said death rates were an equally important marker of the progression of the pandemic. “Today, (on Sunday) the death rate is 0.25%,” he said, adding that since 85% of the positive patients were asymptomatic, there was no shortage of public beds. On Sunday, ten deaths were recorded in the city after seven on Saturday. The city’s overall Covid-19 toll has reached 11,586, while the state’s cumulative fatalities have touched 53,399. Mumbai currently accounts for merely 12% of the cases being reported from Maharashtra. The state has been contributing over 62% of the country’s daily detections. The city’s overall caseload is now 3,62,675. With the surge, the city’s active cases crossed 22,000, while Maharashtra’s reached 210,120. The state last had over 2 lakh active cases in October. Of the total cases on Sunday, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region reported the highest, 6,970. The Pune circle, which reported the second highest cases, saw the highest deaths (27). Whereas MMR saw 16 deaths, lower than Nagpur and Nashik that reported 21 and 17 fatalities, respectively. Out of the 99 deaths, 44 occurred in the last two days while the remaining were in the last few weeks. Within MMR, Kalyan- Dombivli on Sunday reported its second-highest jump of 651 coronavirus patients in the last 24 hours. Last year on July 12, the twin city had reported the highest, 661 Covid-19 cases. The death rate though has remained below 2%. On Sunday, only one death of a 90-year old patient from Dombivli was reported. A maximum 224 patients were reported from Kalyan. Expressing concern over the surge, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who on Friday had a meeting with Nashik’s district administration at Ozar airport, conceded that compared to the first wave, the second surge has become a more challenging task. The only relief was that 11,314 persons were discharged from various hospitals after recovery across the state, including 1,647 in Mumbai, taking the total to 22.14 lakh. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the recovery rate was 89.32%. It had reached 95% in January.

I have become very old to conduct probes against controversial politicians. Pawar himself is the best for the job, why is he involving me in such murky cases,” Ribeiro told TOI. A day after former Mumbai CP Param Bir Singh’s letter bomb against Anil Deshmukh, Pawar had told media persons in Delhi that he would recommend Ribeiro’s name to conduct an impartial inquiry against Deshmukh. Clearly, Ribeiro’s name was proposed without seeking his consent. “I have crossed 92 and the NCP expects me to conduct a probe, not acceptable,” he said. An agitated Ribeiro said he had been fielding calls from media houses the entire day. “Pawar should have appointed a sitting or retired Bombay HC judge. But, before that he must sack the home minister,” a senior IPS officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiwhy-involve-me-in-murky-cases-says-julio-ribeiro/articleshow/81621869.cms||---

These parties which speak about state autonomy have joined hands with national parties like Congress and BJP which have only deprived the state of its rights, he said during his campaign in Thirumangalam, Usilampatti and Palanganatham in Madurai on Sunday. Periyar had stated that Kamaraj had done for the state what even kings had failed to do. If he built schools, the Dravidian parties set up Tasmac shops, the filmmaker-turned politician said. They have corporatised politics with the help of brand managers and forgotten that politics is a service to the people. “We see it as a system to induce politics into all life forms including birds, animals, humans and trees,’’ he said. “If you continue to think that DMK and AIADMK will bring in change you will continue to be cheated of your rights,’’ he said. Seeman said he was the only person who had spoken about their rights for 6,000 hours in the last 10 years. “I don’t have any money to give cash for votes, however I am ready to serve the people with a pure mind, so please vote for us,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dravidian-parties-have-fooled-people-for-50-years-says-ntk-leader-seeman/articleshow/81621233.cms||---

Sulfikar Mayuri of Nationalist Congress Kerala (NCK), Zenin Rashi, a student leader of Bharatiya National Janata Dal (BNJD), and UV Dinesh Mani, a candidate fielded as independent by the local leadership are still in the fray. Kozhikode MP MK Raghavan who on Saturday had said that there was no question of accepting the NCK candidate, softened his stand on Sunday. Raghavan said that whatever the party and UDF leadership decide applied to everyone. He said that it was natural that two candidates would withdraw the nominations. Meanwhile, Mani C Kappan said that the seat was allocated to them (NCK) and that they would run from Elathur. He said that only one candidate would be there and that would be the NCK candidate. That said, all three candidates from the UDF camp who have filed nominations expressed confidence on Sunday. Mayuri said that he has started informal campaigning and a full-fledged campaign would be rolled out once the formal decision was announced. “Unlike what is being widely circulated, I already have the support of congress workers here. At least a hundred of them were with me the other day. I have started to meet people personally seeking votes,” said Mayuri. Dinesh Mani, meanwhile, said that he would decide on the next step based on the decision of the constituency committee of the party. “I filed nomination based on the decision of the local leadership. If the meeting on Monday decides that I should run then I will and if the decision is the opposite, I will accept that as well,” said Dinesh Mani. Meanwhile, BNJD that has two members in the Chelannur panchayat is also hopeful about the candidature. “We are getting a positive response from the UDF. I filed the nomination as an independent and am hopeful of getting the front's support,” said BNJD's Zenin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/impasse-in-elathur-as-3-udf-candidates-stay-put/articleshow/81620485.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: Congress urges govt to call meet of all parties over Covid spurt||NEW DELHI: Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president Anil Kumar expressed grave concern at the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi and urged the Aam Aadmi Party government to call an all-party meeting to discuss free vaccination to all Delhiites. Kumar alleged that Delhi government had lowered its guard when the Covid-19 positivity rate witnessed a slump, which has now proved to be counter-productive. He said that it was not the time to indulge in petty politics as the positivity rate has gone above 1%, Covid-19 cases have almost doubled in six days and positivity rate risen by 78% after detecting just 407 cases on March 14, which was very worrying. The DPCC president said that Delhi government should have been more alert in managing the spread of Covid-19 and demanded that an urgent meeting of Delhi Disaster Management Authority be convened to plan a strategy to check the spread. He said that more people should be brought under the free Covid-19 vaccination bracket. Claiming that the Rs 50 crore earmarked in the Delhi budget for free Covid jabs is very meagre and will cover only 5% of Delhi’s population, Kumar asked more funds be allocated for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cong-urges-govt-to-call-meet-of-all-parties-over-covid-spurt/articleshow/81621251.cms||---

Maharashtra’s 30,535 was the fourth day in a row of over 25,000 cases. Almost mirroring the state’s growth, Mumbai added 3,779 cases, just over 200 short of 4,000 and second in five days when the count was over 3,000. Worryingly, the state’s Covid-19 daily mortality climbed to 99,the highest in 106 days. The state has added over 3.24 lakh cases this month, compared to 1.3 lakh and 92,177 cases in February and January. Mumbai has added 36,758 cases in March, double of 18,362 recorded in February and a 125% jump from January (16,310). Civic chief IS Chahal told TOI they were gearing up for 6,000 cases per day in the coming weeks. Civic chief IS Chahal told TOI: “The rise in cases is on expected lines and shouldn’t create any panic,” he said. “Testing has been going up. We are pushing it to 50,000 from the current daily average of 24,500 tests. The best way to control the spread is doubling testing and isolating positives.” Chahal said death rates were an equally important marker of the progression of the pandemic. “Today, (on Sunday) the death rate is 0.25%,” he said, adding that since 85% of the positive patients were asymptomatic, there was no shortage of public beds. On Sunday, ten deaths were recorded in the city after seven on Saturday. The city’s overall Covid-19 toll has reached 11,586, while the state’s cumulative fatalities have touched 53,399. Mumbai currently accounts for merely 12% of the cases being reported from Maharashtra. The state has been contributing over 62% of the country’s daily detections. The city’s overall caseload is now 3,62,675. With the surge, the city’s active cases crossed 22,000, while Maharashtra’s reached 210,120. The state last had over 2 lakh active cases in October. Of the total cases on Sunday, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region reported the highest, 6,970. The Pune circle, which reported the second highest cases, saw the highest deaths (27). Whereas MMR saw 16 deaths, lower than Nagpur and Nashik that reported 21 and 17 fatalities, respectively. Out of the 99 deaths, 44 occurred in the last two days while the remaining were in the last few weeks. Within MMR, Kalyan- Dombivli on Sunday reported its second-highest jump of 651 coronavirus patients in the last 24 hours. Last year on July 12, the twin city had reported the highest, 661 Covid-19 cases. The death rate though has remained below 2%. On Sunday, only one death of a 90-year old patient from Dombivli was reported. A maximum 224 patients were reported from Kalyan. Expressing concern over the surge, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who on Friday had a meeting with Nashik’s district administration at Ozar airport, conceded that compared to the first wave, the second surge has become a more challenging task. The only relief was that 11,314 persons were discharged from various hospitals after recovery across the state, including 1,647 in Mumbai, taking the total to 22.14 lakh. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the recovery rate was 89.32%. It had reached 95% in January.

BJP, however, has claimed that the photo belongs to someone else who “must have got the house under the scheme”. “First they name a person as their candidate in this constituency without even asking her and now they have used someone’s photograph without her permission to showcase a central government scheme claiming the woman has got a new house. This is plain forgery,” said Nayana Bandyopadhyay, sitting MLA and TMC candidate from Chowringhee. Lakshmi Devi (50), who claimed it’s her photo that featured in the newspaper advertisement, said she had no inkling about when the photo was clicked. “I have lived in this shanty for 35 years. I don’t have any house be it in the city or at our native place in Bihar,” said Lakshmi Devi, who works as a sweeper at a park for a salary of Rs 500. BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said the advertisement didn’t even feature the said woman. “The photo is of a woman living in a Bengal village who must have got the house. There are many people in the world who look similar,” said Basu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tmc-latches-on-to-pmay-ad-lie-bjp-rubbishes-its-claims/articleshow/81623585.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Tenders will be floated after obtaining permission from the committee. It will take at least three months for the purchase of the vehicles as they cannot initiate works at once due to the model code of conduct,” a Madurai Corporation official said.The addition of a robot will help the corporation curb manual scavenging. The civic body has 15 desilting auto rickshaws, eight mini jet rodding vehicles, four suction trucks and one supper sucker vehicle currently. Although they insist workers not to enter manholes and use machines, incidents of manual scavenging take place without their knowledge. The civic body is planning to purchase a few more equipment to completely mechanize sewer line cleaning works.“We need to add a few more equipment as the equipment available at present is insufficient as the city will add 150km of sewer lines - the underground drainage facility is being extended to 15 wards in the northern part of the city,” said another official.The recent order from the Madras high court that the chief of the civic bodies will face arrest and criminal proceedings in case of death due to manual scavenging has set the warning bells ringing. Officials are planning to put in place a mechanism to prevent manual scavenging. Meanwhile, they are working to add more equipment to bridge the gap, officials said.There is a need to purchase a few more robots apart from the one, which has been proposed under CFC fund, officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-corpn-gets-rs-15-5cr-central-funds-for-amenities/articleshow/81621279.cms||V Devanathan

The candidates had requested the election commission to allot them the symbol ‘a farmer driving a tractor’. Speaking to TOI, PC Thomas, whose party merged with the group led by Joseph, said the uncertainty over the symbol is over. “There was some uncertainty in getting the symbol in Changanassery and Ettumanur constituencies. Candidates of two registered parties too had demanded the same symbol in these constituencies. But for other reasons, the party nominations of these individuals were not accepted and they were told to contest as independent candidates,” said Thomas. Since Kerala Congress is a registered party its candidates were given priority in the allotment of symbol over the independent candidates in these two constituencies. In the other constituencies no other registered parties have applied for the symbol which the candidates of Joseph group had chosen. The candidates of Kerala Congress party are P J Joseph (Thodupuzha), Monce Joseph (Kaduthuruthy), Thomas Unniyadan (Irinjalakkuda), Jacob Abraham (Kuttanad), K Francis George (Idukki), Prince Lukose (Ettumanur), V J Laly (Changanassery), Kunjukoshy Paul (Thiruvalla), Shibu Thekkumpuram (Kothamangalam) and M P Joseph (Thrikkarippur).

---||Delhi||No court reprieve for two over scam during lockdown||New Delhi: It is particularly harsh and prima facie dishonest that even during the financial strife during the coronavirus-induced lockdown, the accused succeeded in extracting investment from multiple persons, a city court noted while rejecting the anticipatory bail plea of two people accused of cheating investors through a Ponzi scheme. Accused Sheetal Sahni and Sukhwinder Singh Sahni were accused of allegedly inducing people to invest with the promise that they would get exponential returns. “That the accused succeeded in inducing multiple investors to shell out about Rs 5.7 crore by ensuring returns only for the initial few, typifies the modus operandi of such schemes,” additional sessions judge Vishal Gogne observed. The complainant in the case initially invested small amounts. However, the investors soon grew to groups of 20 people and subsequently 40 people, including members of the family of complainant. Initially, the money was returned to all members, but the accused reinvested the amount received from the complainant. It was alleged in the FIR that the accused insisted on receiving the contribution from the investors even during the lockdown but failed to pay any return on these investments. These contributions were collected from the investors by a person named Ali, sent by accused Sheetal Sahni. After the lockdown was lifted, the complainant and other purported victims came forward to register their complaints with the cops. The accused had been earlier granted interim protection from arrest and directed to deposit Rs 2 crore in fixed deposit receipts (FDR). However, they failed to deposit the amount. The accused’s counsel, instead, argued that the detention of his client owing to non-grant of anticipatory bail would further limit their ability to either repay the investors or deposit the directed FDR amount or for that matter reach any other further financial settlements with the investors. On the contrary, the state submitted that the accused had been enjoying the liberty without making any effort to provide monetary relief to the deceived investors. The counsels for the complainants stressed that the accused could have liquidated the house and shops as security in lieu of the deposit of the FDR. The court noted that the accused had not even made a partial effort to comply with the previous direction and were apparently only seeking to gain time for further interim protection from arrest. The order also highlighted that the scheme in question was based on the assurance of high returns using the seed money from the initial investors and utilising the contributions from the subsequent investors to provide initial good returns to the first line of investors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-court-reprieve-for-two-over-scam-during-lockdown/articleshow/81621288.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Madurai||Stopping physical classes setback for students: Teachers||Madurai: Though the move to close down schools for classes IX to XI has been welcomed in light of rising Covid-19 cases, teachers are of the opinion that it is a setback for students who were finally able to attend proper physical classes.“This is a reckless move by the government. Schools are functioning with only 20% capacity when you consider only classes IX to XII. There is plenty of space for social distancing since other classes are not functional. If Class XII students can come to school, then these students can also come to school safely,” said M Arumugam, state president, Federation of Private School Associations (FePSA). Though online classes are allowed to continue, teachers are unhappy as they feel shifting from physical classes to online again is stressful and difficult for students.“We were making classes IX to XI students learn the syllabus of the current academic year in a focused manner through physical classes. This would be a setback as students don’t put in as much effort in online classes,” said S Shanthi, a physics teacher. Exams were also being planned to be held to have some form of evaluation for students of classes IX to XI. However, now, it remains to be seen if online exams will be allowed for evaluation.Government school teachers are also equally worried as without physical classes most students are not learning at all from home. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/stopping-physical-classes-setback-for-students-teachers/articleshow/81621291.cms||---
---||Delhi||Row over interfaith marriage boils over in southeast Delhi||New Delhi: Mayhem erupted in a locality in southeast Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan after over a dozen men forcibly entered the house of a 21-year-old youth on Saturday night after coming to know that he had married a girl from another community. The incident was captured on CCTV cameras. Paramilitary forces were deployed to defuse the tension in the area. The couple has been shifted to a safe location. Police said they were in talks with people from both the communities and were trying to pacify them. The elderly and religious leaders from both sides had been roped in to thwart any untoward incident. A case of rioting and other sections of IPC has been registered at Sunlight Colony police station and four people — Farman, Shahrukh, Hasan Ali and Raza — were arrested till Sunday evening. Farman, the girl’s brother, planned the attack as he was outraged with the interfaith marriage. The cops are still looking for 6-7 men who were visible in the CCTV footage. DCP (Southeast) RP Meena said the PCR received a call regarding the chaos around 11pm on March 20. “After senior officers went to the spot, they found that the couple, who both lived in the locality, got married against the will of their parents. The girl’s relatives came to the boy’s lane and damaged vehicles, etc,” he added. The residents of the lane said they were terrified after the incident and feared for their life. One of the youth’s relatives said that the couple got married in a temple on March 14 despite objections by the girl’s family. “The girl’s family had fixed her marriage with someone else. She was under no pressure and herself went to police to give a statement that she married the boy of her own will,” said a relative of the youth. Police were also provided with the marriage certificate and photos of the couple during the ceremony. The family members of the girl accused the youth of having converted her to Hinduism and threatened him with dire consequences. On Sunday night, they vandalised the houses of the youth and others in the neighbourhood. In the CCTV footage, a mob could be seen going on a rampage, throwing away ladders and cycles on the ground, forcibly opening the gates of houses and pelting stones. Locals residents alleged that they were attacked with sticks and swords.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/row-over-interfaith-marriage-boils-over-in-southeast-delhi/articleshow/81621300.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Parking violations: Traffic police identify roads in central Kolkata, plan surprise raids||KOLKATA: The Kolkata traffic police has identified a few roads in central Kolkata which usually witness the maximum number of car-parking violations. The traffic headquarters are planning to conduct surprise checks on these roads. The police said multiple complaints on social media pages have prompted them to take such a measure. “This will help us understand the authenticity of these complaints and also search for solutions,” said an officer. On Sunday, TOI witnessed similar violations at the Maidan. “There were bikers at Maidan parked on the greens and riding on the tram tracks. There were no cops visible for several hours. It was only after the cops arrived late in the evening that things improved a bit,” said Md Feroze, who went to play football at the Maidan. Earlier, Kolkata Police had formed a special team to ensure there is no parking in and around Maidan. An inspector has been assigned to lead the team of five sergeants and 10 constables, along with green police personnel, to keep tabs on offenders. An assistant commissioner has also been assigned to periodically assess the situation and take necessary measures. The deployment for keeping Maidan free of encroachment follows the Calcutta High Court observation on the matter. A division bench had ordered a PIL on Maidan’s upkeep and encroachment. Similar complaints came from the Sudder Street, Bertram Street and Chowringhee Place. One of the complainants, Anmitra Neogy tweeted, along with a photograph of the area. “This is Sudder Street today at 6pm. Vehicles are not only parked in double lines but also parked on the footpath on a regular basis. I have reported this quite a few times but the traffic guard concerned is perhaps not taking necessary steps to stop this,” he wrote. “Necessary action has been taken on all previous complaints as verified by ground enquiry. This complaint has been shared with the traffic guards concerned for action as mandated by law,” DC traffic tweeted back. “Now, we have discussed with KMC and fixed the exact parking spots in these zones. Anyone facing any trouble while parking can approach the nearest cop or call us at Lalbazar traffic headquarters. We have instructed police stations not to allow parking cartels to control parking according to their whims and fancies,” said an officer. Sources said illegal parking in the Burrabazar-Posta area, along with Park Street-Camac Street, Short Street and Mirza Ghalib Street should attract penalties. A senior officer said the move is also aimed to ensure that fee parking spaces are specifically identified (as against no parking spots) after the KMC said it wanted to introduce parking fees at specific parking lots in this area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/parking-violations-traffic-cops-identify-roads-in-central-kol-plan-surprise-raids/articleshow/81620497.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Tamil Telugu National Party, My India Party, National Democratic party of South India, Anna MGR Dravida Makkal Kazhagam, Bahujan Dravida Party (BDP) and Tipu Sultan Party are some of these outfits contesting the assembly election in the state. Funded by E V S Rajkumar Naidu, Tamil Telugu National Party is testing the waters for the second time after the Tuticorin Lok Sabha elections in 2019, where it polled just over 2,000 votes. “ I may not get many votes without an alliance, but it is important to emerge as a leader for this (Telugu-speaking) community and be a major deciding factor in at least ten constituencies,” says Naidu, who is contesting from Madurai Central. K Senthilraj of My India Party was previously a district secretary of U Sagayam’s Makkal Pathai who switched loyalty to MIP due to Sagayam’s apprehensions against entering politics. ``We are promising a tax-free Tamil Nadu to the people,’’ said the candidate. The National Democratic party of South India is contesting in 20 constituencies with A Marikannan as its candidate for Thirumangalam. MGR Dravida Makkal Kazhagam founded by ex-serviceman Muthurama Singa Perumal, Anna Puratchi Thalaivar Amma Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Tipu Sultan Party (TSP) and Bahujan Dravida Party (BDP) headquartered in Delhi are also in fray. BDP state president Maharajan said spreading the ideologies of Kanshi Ram and Periyar and ensuring that SC/ST and denotified sections were properly represented in administration were their priorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/little-known-parties-want-to-leave-their-mark/articleshow/81621289.cms||---

But the woes of UDF don't end there as a section of the A-group, including Sony Sebastian, the candidate they had wished for, kept away from the meeting. A section of Youth Congress and KSU leaders also did not participate. While Oommen Chandy said Sunday morning that problems at Irikkur were resolved, K Sudhakaran MP while responding after the convention said that it would end in a couple of days. According to Chandy, the dissenting A-group leaders, including Kannur UDF chairman PT Mathew, five KPCC secretaries, over 20 DCC office bearers, and several local leaders have withdrawn their resignations. Sony Sebastian had excused himself from the convention saying he had a funeral to attend to while other A-group leaders namely PT Mathew, KV Philomena, and Thomas Vaakathanam attended the meeting. Meanwhile, the presence of senior leaders KC Joseph, K Sudhakaran, and AICC secretary-in-charge of the state, PV Mohan should calm the candidate's nerves a bit. Sitting MLA KC Joseph urged the party workers to help UDF retain the seat. Pinarayi will be jailed if UDF wins: Sudhakaran K Sudhakaran called for introspection and hinted at the possibility of continuity in governance for the LDF. “This election is not a normal election. Every time you and I used to say, five years UDF and then five years LDF. Don’t think on these lines this time,” Sudhakaran told party workers. "The political scenario of Kerala is changing. A third movement has come up here, they are not strong but a defeat to the UDF would lead to them becoming strong. I remind you, if we lose, then the advantage would be taken by a new phenomenon that would create a new political history in Kerala’s political horizon,” Sudhakaran added. He said that DYFI activists had gained points by interacting with people during the pandemic as only they were given volunteer cards. He added that if the UDF came to power, Pinarayi Vijayan would be incarcerated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/unrest-persists-amid-sajeevs-convention/articleshow/81620495.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The victim Brajesh Yadav had been kidnapped by a man who had studied with his wife and yearned to marry her. Police arrested the prime accused Kapil Mishra and his aide Ajay aka Sooraj, both of Madiaon,on sunday and recovered two country-made pistols and 3 live cartridges from them. Both the accused confessed to their crime. DCP North, Raees Akhtar said Kapil liked a girl but she later decided to marry Brajesh following which Kapil nursed a grudge against him since then and planned his kidnapping. “It is being probed if Kapil intended to kill Brajesh or was just trying to intimidate him,” sources said. Brajesh Kumar Yadav of Gayatripuram in Gudamba was going to Jankipuram for some work at around 11pm on Friday when he was kidnapped at gunpoint by the miscreants who took him to a brick kiln and brutally thrashed him there and looted Rs 700 case he was carrying.

---||Madurai||Docs against Covid duty in Chennai||Madurai: The Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association (TNGDA) on Sunday strongly opposed the transfer of doctors to Chennai for Covid-19 duty and also threatened to boycott orders and hold flash agitation if they are forced. TNGDA state executive committee has put forth various resolutions to the Director of Medical Education and the Director of Medical and Rural Health Services. “Last year, during the peak of Covid-19, around 350 doctors, after post graduation, were deputed to Chennai for three months for Covid-19 duty. They later returned to take up their positions in various districts. Now, they are being asked to once again return for Covid-19 duty in Chennai citing rise in cases. This is inhumane because doctors are already mentally and physically drained,” TNGDA state president Dr K Senthil said. He added those willing to go to Chennai voluntarily can go but they should not be forced. “There is no requirement for such diversion now as there is no rapid increase in Covid-19 cases like last year. When frequent diversion happens, doctors and families are left in the lurch and so far we have not received many of the benefits already promised to us,” TNGDA state general secretary Dr N Ravishankar said. TNGDA office bearers sought for alternative arrangements to be made. It was pointed out that there have been delays in regular promotion and transfers and in the recent counselling doctors would have opted for posts in Chennai and neighbouring districts and with the permission of the Election Commission. The association also called for better utilisation of government Indian medicine and private hospital doctors for Covid care. “When Indian medicine systems and doctors are being praised, why not make use of them for Covid-19 duty? Private hospital doctors too could be roped in instead of pressurising government doctors who are already working long hours in non-Covid-19 duty,” said Dr Senthil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/docs-against-covid-duty-in-chennai/articleshow/81621297.cms||---

---||Delhi||Become Wetland Mitra, do your bit to revive Delhi’s waterbodies||NEW DELHI: Anyone above the age of 12 years wishing to preserve or revive waterbodies in the capital can now apply and be a “Wetland Mitra” for Delhi government. In a notice issued recently by Delhi State Wetland Authority, people have been asked to come forward and become “friends of the wetlands”. Their responsibility would include keeping waterbodies clean and taking the government’s assistance to trap sewage and remedy other localised problems, including removal of encroachments. However, no payment or honorarium would be made by Delhi government to the Wetland Mitras, added the notice. A Delhi government official said the concept was taken from Kerala, where such a system has been tried in the past. The aim is to promote efforts from locals willing to adopt johads and local ponds for their preservation. In all, 155 waterbodies across the capital are also planned to be revived in three phases by December 2022. “The concept is an informal, voluntary and non-statutory network of concerned citizens to foster and promote community engagement in wetland conservation and management efforts. Any individual who can provide their time and services for the protection, management and beautification of their nearby wetlands can apply to become Wetland Mitras,” said the notice. To apply, one can fill the form on the website of Delhi Parks and Gardens Society. The qualifications include the applicant living or working near a wetland, being above the age of 12 years, having an Indian citizenship and knowing both Hindi and English. Once chosen, applicants would become Wetland Mitra for two years and their work would be assessed every six months. The individuals would have to work according to the rules and regulations of Wetlands Conservation and Management Rules, 2017. A Delhi State Wetland Authority official told TOI that they had received over 30 applications so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/become-wetland-mitra-do-your-bit-to-revive-citys-waterbodies/articleshow/81621321.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Kolkata||New Town Kolkata Development Authority starts special camp to help taxpayers||KOLKATA: The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has come up with a special camp and help desk to help more taxpayers in the New Town area, especially senior citizens and those who are not digitally savvy, with their property tax assessment, filing and payment. Meanwhile, the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (NDITA) has sent letters to all companies and establishments in Sector V who have not paid their property tax dues yet to clear them by March 31. Both NDITA and NKDA authorities recently reviewed the status of collection of property tax in Sector V and New Town. Officials said that property tax collection in both the townships has been below the amount collected in the last financial year till the same date. The ongoing Covid pandemic has been found to be one of the major reasons for this with some IT offices still operating on ‘Work from Home’ basis. In New Town, a special property tax camp has started since last week and will continue till March 31 on the ground floor of the utility building near Tank number 3. Officials said that the camp is an extension of the existing one, to help more taxpayers for assessment, filing, and payment of their property tax. The authorities have also introduced a property tax helpline no (033 – 2324-2127), functional during the working hours from Monday to Friday (except on public holidays). NKDA have also introduced ‘Tax Sathis’ for senior citizens.  As on March 17, NKDA has collected about Rs 31 crore in this financial year, whereas they had collected about Rs 43 crore in the last financial year. NDITA’s records till March 17 show they have collected about Rs 47 crore in comparison to Rs 65 crore collected last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nkda-starts-special-camp-to-help-taxpayers/articleshow/81620525.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Mumbai||Without orders, no cop will put explosives near Ambanis’ house: MNS chief Raj Thackeray||MUMBAI: In a no-holds-barred attack on the ruling coalition, MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Sunday demanded resignation of state home minister Anil Deshmukh in the wake of allegations levelled by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. The MNS chief backed the move to have the case of the explosive-laden vehicle placed near Mukesh Ambani’s residence investigated by a Central agency and sought a probe into Deshmukh’s role by a central agency saying Maharashtra government cannot be entrusted with such a sensitive matter. He said no policeman would dare to place explosives near Ambani’s residence without instructions from the top. He pointed the finger at his cousin and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, saying Waze, the cop arrested in connection with the case, was close to the chief minister. "The person who introduced Waze in the Shiv Sena should come out,” said MNS chief. Raj said going by former CM Devendra Fadnavis’s statements, Uddhav Thackeray had urged Fadnavis to reinstate Waze, who was under suspension for about 17 years and jailed for about 58 days in the Khwaja Yunus case. “What does it mean? It means that Waze was very close to CM and party president Uddhav Thackeray,” said Raj. He also said Deshmukh should resign on his own or be sacked. Former top cop Singh alleged in a letter to CM Thackeray that Deshmukh had asked Waze to collect Rs 100 crore every month from bars and restaurants. Raj said, “Bars and restaurants do not exist in Mumbai only, they are across the state. He is the home minister of the state. So, it should be checked if he has asked other police commissioners too,” said Raj..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiwithout-orders-no-cop-will-put-explosives-near-ambanis-house/articleshow/81621875.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Delhi||Rate waterbodies close to your home on mobile app||New Delhi: Ahead of the World Water Day, Delhiites will now be able to rate the health scrore of any waterbody they visit, thanks to a mobile application developed by a Delhi-based NGO. People can choose rate the waterbody on different parametres, like if the waterbody stinks, if it looks visibly clean, whether sewage flows into it or there are any encroachments around it. The real-time ‘health’ score of the waterbody will keep changing over time, depending on public ratings. The NGO says this can allow the government to monitor its progress and identify waterbodies requiring the most work on ground. The application has been developed by members of the NGO Centre for Youth Culture Law and Environment (Cycle India), taking assistance of two students from the Dronacharya College of Engineering – Yogesh Yadav and Nikhil Kumar. The NGO, along with the RWA of Jhuljhuli village in southwest Delhi, had similarly developed a ‘health’ index for 1,009 waterbodies across the capital last year. Each waterbody was mapped through geo-coordinates provided by the Delhi Parks and Gardens Society and each given a score from 0 to 7, where 7 was the healthiest. Paras Tyagi, co-founder of the NGO, said the application was in the works since last year, soon after the health card was released. Tyagi says the idea is to monitor the progress in reviving waterbodies, with public interactions to bring to light the ones in a terrible condition. “As the health index keeps getting updated, those whose rating is dropping can indicate a deterioration in its condition. Similarly, those which are improving on the index can show progress in terms of the water quality or its overall protection,” said Tyagi, adding that they plan to approach Delhi government soon to popularise the app. Deepak Yadav, a coordinator at Cycle India, said the app also allows people to use the geo-coordinates to identify waterbodies nearby. “We want the government to make the application popular as it will only benefit them,” Yadav said. In the exercise carried out last year, no waterbody in Delhi could get a rating higher than four. Several waterbodies, in fact, had received a negative rating on the health index, indicating encroachment or presence of construction on their area. The analysis last year had also found only 327 of these water bodies had water through the year, while 345 were dry and fully bereft of water. Another 302 had been given negative health ratings because they were found to have been partially or completely encroached upon. Among the prominent ponds, Naini, Sanjay and Bhalswa lakes had scored 4 on the index. The Mehrauli (Kishangarh) Lake was given a score of 2.5, while Khirki Lake scored 2. The waterbodies at Rajokri and Hauz Khas were scored 3.5 on the index.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rate-waterbodies-close-to-your-home-on-mobile-app/articleshow/81621328.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The accused, identified as Bittu Singh Rawat alias Vijay, 22, confessed to having been with the woman in the hotel room the night before her body was discovered. Several cases of theft are registered against Vijay in Pauri, Almora and Haridwar district, according to police. “Vijay confessed that he killed the woman, Muskan, in a fit of rage. He said Muskan wanted him to get drugs for her, and when he refused, she started shouting at him,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dehradun Yogendra Rawat. Vijay had checked in at the hotel using a fake ID. “He pickpocketed the wallet of Sunil Kumar, a resident of Haridwar, and showed his ID at the hotel. After he committed the murder, he kept changing locations to evade arrest. We zeroed in on him after a week,” said SSP Rawat. Police added that Muskan was married and her husband had forced her into prostitution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/serial-offender-arrested-for-murder-of-22-yr-old-woman-found-dead-in-doon/articleshow/81620531.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||---||MNM could dent prospects of both DMK and AIADMK fronts in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: Unlike superstar Rajinikanth, actor Kamal Haasan did not keep his fans and the people on tenterhooks over his decision to enter politics. He jumped into the fray soon after making up his mind and launched his Makkal Needhi Maiam in February 2018 as a ‘centrist’ party that will not lean either extreme right or extreme left. This bold approach endeared him to the youth and the first-time voters as the party entered electoral politics in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, within 15 months of launch. Though the party secured a vote share of just 3.72%, as against its own expectation of around 8%, it did well in a few urban constituencies, where the vote share was in the range of 10%-12%. Candidates of the DMK-led Congress-inclusive alliance won with huge margins of victory against the NDA that included the BJP and the AIADMK in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. So, poll analysts are not sure whose vote bank Kamal Haasan’s party may have dented. But the traction that MNM’s ‘Torch Light’ symbol attracted in the LS polls indicated that the urban youth, educated middle class and a sizeable section of first-time voters had backed him to the hilt. Now, as MNM gears up for its first assembly election race, the party seems to be better prepared. The party’s focus on bringing e-governance to every home, an honorarium to the head woman of the family (despite the concept being copied by both the DMK and the AIADMK) and a firm stand against corruption is sure to attract lot of neutral voters, besides its faithful base among youth and first-time voters. In his speeches, Kamal has been attacking both the DMK and the AIADMK equally, besides the BJP. To erase any charge of him being the BJP’s B-team, he has para-trooped himself to land in Coimbatore South assembly segment, which was nurtured for long by BJP leader Vanathi Srinivasan and further strengthened his contest by meeting the local Jamath leader. As a result, his party could scoop away voters, who would have otherwise voted for these parties. If he manages to attract minorities towards him, that could dent the DMK. If women in urban areas too pitch for him, that could dent the AIADMK further. Fortunately for the DMK and the AIADMK, MNM has conceded 80 seats to its allies actor Sarat Kumar’s SMK and IJK led by educationist and Lok Sabha MP T R Paarivendhar and hence, its impact could be limited to the 150-plus seats the party is directly contesting from.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/tamil-nadu/mnm-could-dent-prospects-of-both-dmk-and-aiadmk-fronts/articleshow/81621324.cms||D Govardan
---||Chandigarh||KU to get Haryana’s first velodrome||KURUKSHETRA: Haryana sports and youth affairs minister Sandeep Singh on Sunday said that the state’s first velodrome will be developed on over 10 acres of land at Kurukshetra University (KU) campus. Sandeep said the process of finalising the land is almost final and construction of the velodrome will start soon. Sandeep was talking to KU vice-chancellor Prof Som Nath Sachdeva. After holding a meeting with the university administration, he inspected land on the campus towards the direction of Brahamsarovar for construction of the velodrome. Sandeep said, “It is the vision of chief minister Manohar Lal to provide better facilities to Haryana players. Therefore, the first velodrome of the state has been given to Kurukshetra district. About 6.50 acre land is required for the velodrome and KU has more than 10 acres of land available. If there is a need to expand this in future, then the adjacent land can also be used.” Sandeep said the upcoming velodrome at KU will benefit players of the university and outside. “The land which has been selected is connected to a road leading towards Brahamsarovar, due to which players from outside will be able to enter from outside while varsity players will have entry from inside. Direction of the sun will also be taken care of during construction of the velodrome so that players do not face inconvenience while practicing their games,” said Sandeep Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ku-to-get-haryanas-first-velodrome/articleshow/81621323.cms||JK Singh
---||Mumbai||NCP slams Parambir; says probe on, rules out Deshmukh’s resignation||New Delhi/Mumbai: Amid speculation over continuance of Anil Deshmukh as Maharashtra home minister after former Mumbai police chief Parambir Singh’s “letter bomb”, NCP ruled out the minister’s resignation late on Sunday, arguing that Singh’s allegations came after he was moved to an insignificant post. Earlier in the day though, Pawar had suggested that the decision on the home minister was for the CM to make. “The ATS and the NIA are investigating. The state government will probe this properly... any official, no matter how high up in the hierarchy, this is the government’s determination. There is no need for Deshmukh’s resignation,” NCP leader Jayant Patil said. “The biggest need is to investigate who placed the vehicle outside Mukesh Ambani’s residence and who killed the man (Mansukh Hiran),” Patil said after a meeting of party leaders. Though NCP stood by Deshmukh, sources did not rule out the possibility of the minister being moved from home and an inquiry being ordered into Singh’s allegations and related matters. NCP chief Sharad Pawar suggested a probe in a media interaction on Sunday by retired police officer Julio Ribeiro. Pawar, deputy CM Ajit Pawar, senior leader Praful Patel and Patil took part in the discussions. Congress leader Kamal Nath also met Pawar, perhaps conveying his party’s views on the raging controversy. It is understood that the NCP felt the allegations levelled by Singh lacked substance and could be seen as the act of a disgruntled officer. With sensational charges levelled by Singh heating up an already heady crime-and-extortion saga involving Waze, the NCP chief seemed to train his guns on the former Mumbai police chief, saying it was his decision to reinstate Waze. He said Singh’s claims of Waze being asked by Deshmukh to raise money from bars and restaurants were made after his transfer and neither the home minister nor chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had anything to do with Waze’s suspension being lifted. Singh’s letter has resulted in BJP stepping up the demand for Deshmukh’s resignation and calling for a CBI probe. The political heat has increased pressure on NCP with names of likely replacements for Deshmukh also doing the rounds even though Pawar’s comments sidestepped the home minister’s role. With NIA now probing both the Antilia explosives case and the alleged murder of Hiran, NCP and its partners would need to consider the possibility of more embarrassing revelations in the two cases. Pawar called the allegations raised by Singh “serious and sensitive”. He added that the CM had full authority to take a decision on the issue. Pawar said he would like an inquiry into the issue by a personality above reproach—someone like former Mumbai police chief Julio Ribeiro—which will bring out the truth and also restore confidence of people in the police. Ribeiro later said he was not interested in heading any probe into such “a murky case”. Pawar said it was noteworthy that Singh did not speak for around three days after his shunting from CP to an unimportant post, noting that his letter had followed his visit to Delhi as also that of leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis. Significantly, the NCP chief confirmed that Singh had met him but denied he had discussed the allegations, claiming he only mentioned the talk going on then about shifting him out as CP, which he had termed unfair. Pawar, to questions, said Singh had vaguely mentioned political interference in his department. The NCP patriarch said the allegations could be an attempt to destabilise the Maharashtra government but it would have no impact. Asked if there could be an impartial inquiry with Deshmukh as HM, Pawar said, “If the name I have suggested is accepted, nothing can come in the way and the truth will come out.” He argued that a Ribeiro-led probe would be above all the agencies like the CBI. He said the probe can bring out why Singh did not level allegations earlier. He said the charges may also be a diversionary tactic to ensure the responsibility does not fall upon Singh (for reinstating Waze). NCP minister Nawab Malik said, “There must be concrete evidence against the cabinet member.” Pawar also said Singh’s charge about pressure to lodge a case in seven-term MP Mohan Delkar’s suicide was misplaced as it was the duty of Mumbai Police to register an FIR in case of a suicide in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ncp-slams-parambir-says-probe-on-rules-out-deshmukhs-resignation/articleshow/81622600.cms||---
---||Delhi||A High Five From Youths And Parents||New Delhi: Being 21 means you can now legally imbibe in the capital — and both youngsters and parents think lowering the drinking age in Delhi from 25 years is a great idea. With such a provision already in place in the neighbouring cities, the youth are happy they no longer have to reach Noida or Ghaziabad for a tipple or try their luck in the city with a fake ID card. On their part, the parents feel the reduced eligibility age for alcohol will inculcate responsibility in their wards. Debraj Mookerjee, associate professor at Ramjas College and a father of two, felt this is a good move considering that underaged kids were anyway already drinking. “It doesn't make sense for them to wait till they were 25,” Mookerjee said. “With the bar at 21, perhaps the age at which they leave college, they'll probably rather wait to attain the legal age before actually drinking. In any case, 25 was an arbitrary barrier.” The professor, in fact, felt the age should be lowered to 18 and youngsters allowed to drink wine or beer with accompanying adults. “That will help them adapt responsibly to the freedom of being able to drink,” explained Mookerjee. There is concurrence on this from Satya Prakash, president, All India Parents Association, Delhi chapter. Saying 18 is not a bad age to allow alcohol to youngsters, he said, “Let them be adult enough to decide when to consume alcohol.” Subir Thakur, a parent, too argued in favour of this proposition. “If at 18, one can decide which government is good for the country, then this age should be okay for drinking too,” he reasoned. Recent DU graduate Jaishree Kumar had a similar argument. “When the bar on what you can do is lifted at that age in so many areas, why can’t you drink at 21?” the 21-year-old asked. “This is a good move. I know people who go to the NCR cities to enjoy the experience of sitting in a bar. And yes, there are many places in Delhi that cater to the underaged clientele with ID cards and accompanied by an elder person.” This farcical situation was confirmed by many young Delhiites. “Many of us got fake ID cards made in case we were asked to prove our identities in a bar or a pub,” confessed 21-year-old Tanisha Jain, a final-year student at OP Jindal Global University. “So, what this decision will do at most is remove the fear of being caught.” Aditya Rao, 21, an engineering student at IP University, said the step will aid Delhi government when it wants to curb illegal procurement of alcohol. “Besides, it is possible that the youth will now start to consume more alcohol because that that deterrence of being caught will vanish.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-high-five-from-youths-and-parents/articleshow/81640132.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Lucknow||Valuing water through Jal Jeevan Mission||Clean water is a basic human need and should be easily accessible to all. Though there is enough fresh water on the planet, poor planning, and lack of adequate infrastructure and investment create a shortage that deprives millions of people in low and middle income countries accessing it. As a result, each year scores of people, mainly children, die of preventable diseases associated with inadequate and unsafe water supply, sanitation and hygiene behaviours. Such situation is a grim reality in many pockets of India too. Over the past few decades, India has become a water stressed nation while it is likely to become a water scarce country after 2050. Worse, deteriorating water quality is further reducing the availability of drinking water. However, the launch of Jal Jeevan Mission — that aims at creating a jan andolan for water, thereby making it everyone’s priority — offers an opportunity to value the water resources and save the future generations from the imminent crisis. Envisioned to provide safe and adequate drinking water through individual household tap connections by 2024 to all households in rural India, Jal Jeevan Mission also mandates source sustainability measures such as recharge and reuse through grey water management, water conservation, and rain water harvesting. In UP, achieving this goal is a gigantic task which requires immense political will and strategic micro-planning as 85% houses do not have piped water supply while the old network is not fully operational. The difficulty of the task is further aggravated as majority of the piped water supply system in the state — old, ongoing and newly proposed — are based on groundwater, 70% of which is already overexploited. Thus, there is a need to come up with strategies that conserve and recharge groundwater and save rainwater effectively. The guiding principles may include: Planning: Each piped water supply system should be planned, designed, executed, operated and maintained in such a way that intended services are provided without interruption. Standard service benchmark and adequate financial and human resources should be ensured for continued operation and management. Valuing water infrastructure: Investing and maintaining water infrastructure and making them climate resilient and optimally designed such that they continue to provide intended services during flood, drought or any public health emergency like Covid-19 without doing any harm to our ecosystem and heath. Use of green materials, process and technology and water surveillance and safety plan must be promoted. Water-budgeting: Effective use of the available assets through water budgeting is an important strategy. It may be achieved through proper water budgeting, i.e, ensuring that supply should always exceed demand. As a rule, supply should always be surplus by 20%. Converging efforts: Technical departments must engage with community stakeholders like elected members of gram, block or zila panchayat and departments like education, agriculture, forest, irrigation in the process for development of the water network. Investing in Jan Andolan: Mobilizing people to reduce their daily water consumption by one litre a day by following simple steps like closing the tap when brushing, shaving, applying soap and scrubbing hand/body, and pour only that much water in glass that you can drink, using grey water to flush toilets.

---||Nagpur||No mobile centres, jab for bedridden at home: NMC||Nagpur: A day after directives from guardian minister Nitin Raut, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Monday reportedly expressed its inability to vaccinate bedridden people at home and launch mobile vaccination centres. The civic body says it requires permission from the government for these two initiatives.Raut on Sunday had directed the NMC and Zilla Parishad (ZP) to plan inoculation bedridden people at home and explore vaccination of people in residential areas by developing mobile vaccination centres.A senior NMC official told TOI, “We have informed the minister that vaccination at home was not possible due to lack of such guidelines from the government. As per existing guidelines, inoculation is allowed at only hospitals and urban primary health centres (UPHCs) or dispensaries. Therefore, mobile vaccination centres are also not permissible,” he said.Another NMC official said it was also risky to vaccinate people at home or residential areas where doctors and other types of facilities are not available. With spike in cases and deaths in the district in March, Raut had targeted to increase vaccination from existing 20,000 per day to 40,000 per day. Also, target is to increase number of vaccination centres to 300.The NMC is doing vaccinating 8,000-10,000 persons per day. With good response from people from age-appropriate group, once again NMC is looking at shortage of doses. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “32,000-35,000 doses were available after vaccination on Monday. We have requested the office of deputy director of health services (DDHS) to provide doses as early as possible,” he said.Similar situation had prevailed in second week of March. DDHS office had then provided doses from Nagpur rural, Wardha and Gadchiroli as stop-gap arrangement. The government had allotted doses, out of which NMC received 1,18,400 doses on March 12.The civic body on Monday increased one centre at Hansapuri Khadan Ayurvedic Dispensary, taking the total to 74. Covaxin is being administered at this centre. Now, six centres are giving Covaxin shots — two at GMCH, and one each at Dr Ambedkar Hospital, Datke Memorial Diagnostic Centre and Viveka Hospital.Remaining 68 centres are giving Covishield jab.Zilla Parishad (ZP) has also increased number of centres in Nagpur Rural from 85 to 86. With this, total number of centres in district has increased to 160.Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B on March 20 had submitted a letter to the state government seeking permission to begin inoculation at 32 private hospitals not empanelled under the government’s schemes. The government is yet to approve the civic body’s proposal.Till now, the government has allowed only empanelled private hospitals, except Viveka Hospital which got special nod last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-mobile-centres-jab-for-bedridden-at-home-nmc/articleshow/81645218.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Chandigarh||Haryana Police constable arrested for links to gangster||Chandigarh: Mahesh Kumar, a Haryana Police constable, who had shot Ajay, a gangster, in Sonipat courts on Thursday, is found to have links to gangster Ramkaran Bahiapur. Bahiapur is involved in around 25 cases, including the triple murder of Sandeep Barwasni and two more persons in 2017. Mahesh was arrested soon after the incident and is currently in the custody of Sonipat police. He will be produced in court on Monday. Police claimed to have recovered Rs 40,000 from him. While Ramkaran is at large, police recovered 696 live cartriges of various bores, one rifle of .315 bore, one damaged revolver, 1.5 kg gold, 2 kg silver, luxury watches, a luxury car and SUV during a raid at his house on Saturday. “Mahesh admitted that he got Rs 50,000 from the gangster who was known to him. As far as Ramkaran and other criminals involved in this incident are concerned, police parties are conducting raids on their possible hideouts,’’ said an official spokesman. Mahesh shot Ajay three times in the head when they had an altercation in the police van parked outside the Sonipat court complex. Ajay was rushed to civil hospital, from where he was taken to PGIMS, Rohtak. His condition is stated to be critical. Ajay’s father was shot dead by a group of assailants at his village in Sonipat district the same day. Police suspected this to be the outcome of a gang war between the Barwasni and Ramkaran gangs. Ajay was a sharpshooter of the Sandeep Barwasni gang. After Sandeep Barwasni and two others were shot dead by Ramkaran gang in Gohana in 2017, Ajay had taken charge of Sandeep’s gang as well. He was lodged in Faridabad jail and was brought to Sonipat to attend the trial of criminal cases against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-police-constable-arrested-for-links-to-gangster/articleshow/81621326.cms||---

PMK’s A V A Kasaali has been fielded against Udhayanidhi Stalin of the DMK in Chepauk-Triplicane constituency, a traditional DMK bastion. “This election is about a farmer versus a trader,” Anbumani said referring to chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and DMK president M K Stalin. “If the state goes to a trader (Stalin), Tamil Nadu will be sold.” Anbumani said people in the constituency have not gained anything from the DMK’s legislators over the years, including from late DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi, and said the same will be the case with the grandson too. “He (Udhayanidhi) won’t even come here if he is elected. Kasaali is not like that. He will lend his shoulders to the people. The reason we are in politics is to serve people. For the DMK, it is a family business enterprise,” said Anbumani. Continuing his attack on the DMK, Anbumani said workers in the party have been sidelined over the years. “There is democracy only in the AIADMK alliance,” he said and called the DMK a monarchy where the baton is passed among the descendants of the family. “A farmer can become chief minister in the AIADMK. In DMK, it’s the father, his son and so on,” he said. Anbumani, who was the Union health minister in the UPA government (of which the DMK had been a constituent), said in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, those elected from the three constituencies in Chennai were “products of nepotism” and chided Stalin for not believing in the public and instead hiring a poll strategist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/tamil-nadu/its-farmer-vs-trader-fight-in-state-anbumani-at-chepauk/articleshow/81621331.cms||Srikkanth D

The seventh week of the campaign will focus on raising and creating awareness among one of the most important segments — commercial fleet vehicle owners comprising two-wheelers, three-wheelers, cab aggregators, goods carriers, freight vehicles, etc. “To encourage and promote a smooth transition of commercial vehicles to EVs, Delhi government has taken many progressive steps under the Delhi EV policy launched in August 2020. Today, the capital provides the most favourable policy framework across India for commercial vehicles to transition to EVs,” Gahlot said. “By switching to an electric vehicle, the fleet owners would not only take a step towards ensuring the better air quality in the national capital, but can save money annually. A two-wheeler fleet owner can save up to Rs 22,000 annually by switching to electric ones,” Gahlot said. Gahlot said that Delhi government has introduced the interest subvention scheme of 5%, which will be offered through Delhi Finance Corporation (DFC). “This scheme is at the advanced stage of drafting and will be announced soon. This scheme can be availed by all range of vehicles and will ensure easy access of finance to fleet companies willing to upgrade their fleet to electric,” he said.

The kiosk managers, Nanmum Maurya and Pradeep Dubey, were again hand in glove with another scamster, Arun Srivastava, an insurance agent. All five accused have been arrested.” The probe also unearthed 45 bank accounts in the name of the accused and a money trail of more than Rs 7 crore. During interrogation, the accountant, Arun Verma, disclosed he collated data on government employees who were beneficiaries of provident fund scheme. He would forge signatures of authorities on GPF bills and encash them. PF account details were provided by other accomplices,” he said. The kingpin, Arun Verma, owns a Rs 2.5-crore bungalow, 4 acre plot and an apartment in Gorakhpur along with Rs 50 lakh deposit at a jewellery shop. He owns another apartment in Deoria, police said.

---||---||Tamil Nadu elections 2021: EPS has kicked the ladder that helped him grow, says Stalin||CHENNAI: With the campaign heat for the assembly election picking up in Tamil Nadu, DMK president M K Stalin accused Edappadi K Palaniswami of kicking the ladder (V K Sasikala) that helped him grow in his political career. Betrayal is more poisonous than a snake or a lizard, he said on Sunday. Addressing an election meeting at Uthiramerur in Kancheepuram district in support of the candidates of the DMK and its allied parties, Stalin said it was not the people who voted Palaniswami to become the chief minister. “He became the chief minister because (former chief minister) J Jayalalithaa died and (deputy chief minister) O Panneerselvam became angry,” Stalin said. “When I say Palaniswami crawled to get the chief minister’s post for himself, he said he is not a snake or a lizard to crawl. But he has kicked the ladder (Sasikala) that helped him and betrayal is more poisonous than a snake or lizard,” Stalin said. The DMK president also called Palaniswami a chameleon for changing his stand on the new farm laws as election is drawing closer. “The DMK and our allied parties have been opposing the three new farm laws right from the beginning. The AIADMK not only extended its support to the new laws but chief minister Palaniswami also termed protesting farmers as agents and brokers. Now, as the election to Tamil Nadu state assembly is nearing, he has changed his stance like a chameleon and says he will oppose the farm laws,” Stalin said. Continuing his relentless attack on the chief minister, Stalin even sought to demolish Palaniswami’s oft-repeated claim that the AIADMK government, with its amicable relationship with the BJP government at the Centre, has been able to get financial assistance whenever required for the state. “It is a blatant lie. The state asked the Centre for Rs 22,573 crore as damages due to Cyclone Vardah, but it got only Rs 766 crore. For Cyclone Ockhi, the demand was Rs 9,302 crore and the state received only Rs 133 crore and in the case of Cyclone Gaja, the state asked Rs 17,899 crore, the Centre gave only Rs 1,145 crore,” Stalin said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/tamil-nadu/eps-has-kicked-the-ladder-that-helped-him-grow-stalin/articleshow/81621339.cms||---
---||Delhi||His Master’s Voice: Why Strays At This City Forest Sing To This Family’s Tune||New Delhi: They aren’t called a man’s best friends for no reason. When playback singer Mohit Chauhan and his family visited south Delhi’s Jahanpanah City Forest on Sunday, four-year-old Charlie rushed towards them. The family served a rice bowl to their favourite canine, but Charlie was having nothing of it: He wanted to be patted first. “Charlie was the first dog to become friends with us,” Chauhan told TOI, while Billy lovingly pawed at him. It was close to a year ago that Chauhan, his wife, Prarthana Gahilote, and sister-in-law Shaguna started feeding 150-odd dogs and 30 puppies at the city forest. With the morning and evening walkers having stopped coming in due to the lockdown, the trio took it upon themselves to ensure that the dogs didn’t go hungry. On Sunday, in keeping with their daily routine, Chauhan and his two companions arrived at the forest at 11.30am. Over the next two hours, they stopped at 20 locations to provide food and water to their animal friends. Every day, they bring 70kg of rice, 10kg of dry food and 60 litres of water for the dogs, but birds, monkeys and mongooses too partake in that. As Charlie and Billy continued to follow them, Shaguna told the two to go back, offering both a treat of chicken sticks. “Different packs of dogs have their own territories within the forest,” she explained. At their next stopover, Greyzu, an adult dog, lay on his back, waiting to be scratched even as four puppies — Kaju, Kishmish, Pista and Badam — jumped into a bucket after Chauhan filled it with water. The dogs have been christened according to their appearance and nature. So, two-month-old “Naughty” has aptly got his name for his tendency to not let anyone share food from his plate. Halfway through their incursion, Prarthana and Shaguna realised that a mother and her puppy (both were not named by the family) hadn’t come to be fed as they did daily. They went inside the bushes to look for them and found the puppy bleeding. They decided to split: Chauhan took the puppy to a veterinarian even as the other two continued feeding rest of the dogs. “The puppy is in a critical condition. He has bites all over his body and has also developed hernia. The vet said his bandages had to be replaced daily and it would take nearly a month for him to heal. We will foster the puppy at home and release him into the forest when he becomes healthy,” Prarthana explained later. The couple had adopted two sick dogs last year after they could not find another foster home. When Chauhan and Co. started feeding the dogs during the lockdown, they assumed that others might join them in their efforts. That didn’t happen. “Most walkers here were senior citizens. They never returned after the lockdown was lifted. Other people probably returned to their native places,” said Shaguna. The family is determined to feed the dogs for a long time to come. “We have got most of the dogs sterilised and vaccinated. As dogs usually have a lifespan of 16-18 years, we have decided to continue to feed them. We have also created a trust — Animals Are People Too — to invite people to help strays,” said Chauhan. It’s the most “soul-satisfying thing”, he added. Inspired by his social media updates, people from as far as the US, the UK and New Zealand have written to Chauhan, narrating how they also have started feeding strays in their areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/his-masters-voice-why-strays-at-this-city-forest-sing-to-this-familys-tune/articleshow/81621344.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The walk organised by heritage enthusiasts began from Clock Tower, covering Picture Gallery, Jama Masjid and finally culminating at Bada Imambada. Later, on Sunday evening, the 'Sham-e-Awadh' began on a rhythmic note with folk singer Malini Awasthi taking the centrestage and filling the air with her soulful renditions. Remembering her days spent as a student at Bhatkhande Music Institute, the folk singer said, "When we were studying and being trained, the university organised many cultural events which gave us the chance to hone our talent and also the opportunity to listen and watch many music and dance stalwarts. There is a need to revive those cultural events again for the present and coming students." The concluding session was a treat to visitors when students of Kathak Kendra and classical dancer Surbhi Shukla performed a dance on 'basant' (spring season). Their expressions and twirls mesmerised the crowd. The festival concluded with a 'ghazal' performance by singer and composer Yugantur Sindoor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/colourful-finale-marks-awadh-mahotsav/articleshow/81621919.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Hundreds of trees uprooted on outer ring road to lay gas pipeline||HYDERABAD: Hundreds of trees along the 15-km stretch of the outer ring road (ORR) were brought down using earth-movers instead of being translocated to lay a gas pipeline in Ghatkesar on Sunday. The issue was flagged by Vata Foundation, a city-based NGO that works in protection and translocation of trees. The NGO posted a video of the earth-movers brutally uprooting the trees. “40k trees along ORR making way for a pipeline by @HPCL near Ghatkesar. Is this how trees are translocated? Survival?,” tweeted the Vata Foundation tagging the municipal administration and urban development minister KT Rama Rao and secretary Aravind Kumar. “The method used by the contractors was absolutely unscientific. Uprooting of these trees using such heavy machinery would reduce their survival chances. Even if they are translocated, they would die a slow death,” said Uday Krishna, founder of Vata Foundation, adding that most of these trees were young saplings—which were planted as part of the state government’s Haritha Haram programme. The MAUD secretary Arvind Kumar took note of the video posted by the NGO and tweeted, “I agree with you... this is certainly not the way for translocation when we give permission to these companies to use ROW. Will take it up immediately.” Many others raised an alarm over many other parts of the ORR where trees have been uprooted similarly to make way. “Your heart will break if you see the north side service road of ORR between Muthangi and Kokapet. Green belt totally ripped off for HMWSSB works,” tweeted Jajjanaka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hundreds-of-trees-uprooted-on-orr-to-lay-gas-pipeline/articleshow/81621925.cms||---

He said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray would take a final decision on Deshmukh’s resignation. “As head of the state cabinet and the state government, the chief minister takes the final call, whether it is about the home minister or some other person. Thackeray has the right to take a decision and he will do so,” said Raut, adding he had discussed the issue with Pawar on Sunday evening. On the opposition which is gunning for Deshmukh’s removal, the Sena leader said, “The government runs for the people of Maharashtra and not for the opposition party. If opposition has a majority they should form the government and decide everything.” Earlier in the day, while speaking to reporters in Nashik, Raut had stressed the need for MVA coalition partners to introspect on what needs to be done to improve the image of the government. “In the last 72 hours, a letter and a police officer have sullied the image of the government. These are painful developments and each of the MVA constituents must introspect and make efforts to improve the coalition’s image,” he said. Raut added while the CM has been doing a good job, the government needs to keep an eye on its officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaicm-will-take-a-call-on-deshmukh-says-raut/articleshow/81621936.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Goa is now the new realty destination for Hyderabadis||HYDERABAD: Already a popular holiday getaway, Goa is fast becoming a favourite realty destination too among Hyderabad’s home buyers. And on their ‘shopping’ list is a range of options: studio apartments to uber luxurious villas, ranging anywhere from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 4 crore (or even more). If some are setting up vacation homes in the coastal state—many from the city travel to Goa every month§others are eyeing rental incomes, hoping to cash in on the heavy flow of tourists through the year, say industry experts. They add that the trend has become particularly pronounced in the last year or so. “Post the pandemic, the need for open spaces has become more important for all of us. Even going for a walk in our cities today is a cumbersome exercise. Goa, on the other hand, allows one to have such experiences,” said Darshan Bhatia, an industrialist from the city who bought a home in north Goa and spends 75% of his work days there. “It's possible because the lockdown has made us very efficient at working remotely,” he added. For Atulya Nidhi, senior executive with a health tech firm, the state is also a lucrative investment destination. He’s on the verge of closing a deal in north Goa. “It assures monthly rents of Rs 25,000 (approx)—so that I don’t need to pay from my pocket towards the home loan—apart from giving us a personal space to occupy when we visit Goa,” said Nidhi, hoping to make a sizeable profit on re-selling the studio home at a later stage. This surge in demand is substantiated by Joseph Britto, director of Acron Homes and Hospitality that has multiple projects across Goa. According to his data, at least 10% of the firm’s recent customer base is from Telangana, particularly Hyderabad. “Most of our buyers are from the bigger cities who have houses there, but are investing in Goa for better quality of life. The expansive green stretches, cleaner air, beaches are driving people here. Rental income is also an attraction,” Britto. Even Priya S, a senior IT professional from Hyderabad, is now toying with the idea of leasing her upscale 1BHK in Dabolim. “We’ve had this property since 2017. Though we used it for our trips so far, we are now contemplating roping in a property management firm to rent the place when we’re not using it,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/goa-is-now-the-new-realty-destination-for-hyderabadis/articleshow/81621956.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||---||DMK may find it tough to breach EPS’s bastion||Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami never misses a chance to proclaim that Edappadi assembly constituency in Salem district remains an impregnable fortress of the AIADMK. ‘Edappadiyar,’ as he is fondly called by the partymen nowadays, points out that the last time the DMK tasted victory in this segment was five decades ago. The opposition camp won the segment in 2006, when the PMK candidate, as an ally of the DMK, defeated the AIADMK. But the victory could largely be attributed to the PMK rather than the DMK. This time around, pitch reports show that the challenge has only got tougher for the DMK. Edappadi could be among the very few segments in the state where the majority vanniyars may not stick to a candidate from their caste, for, Palaniswami, a gounder, gave them 10.5% internal reservation within the MBC quota on the eve of polls. Factors at play in the constituency show that EPS has many more advantages. To start with, the farmers and weavers, who form large chunk of voters, have been backing the AIADMK since the MGR days. The AIADMK has won the segment six times since 1977. Starting from his maiden election in 1989, EPS himself won Edappadi four times. Even in 1996 when there was a DMK–TMC wave, the DMK could not win Edappadi segment and the seat went to the PMK. The odds stacked against the DMK do not end there. The formidable vanniyar vote bank of Edappadi is considered a tougher fort for the DMK to breach than the AIADMK’s. In 2016, the DMK polled lesser votes than the AIADMK and the PMK and had to settle for the third spot. The DMK has attempted to tilt the balance in its favour by fielding a vanniyar, 37-year-old T Sampath Kumar. Besides the caste arithmetic, the principal opposition largely appears to bank on anti-incumbency, anti-BJP sentiments and hopes that AMMK-DMDK alliance will split the AIADMK votes. But AIADMK men say the fact that EPS is a chief ministerial candidate, who has made the segment ‘popular’, would work in their favour. In fact, the primary charge against EPS during his initial three years in office was that he was behaving like the chief minister of Salem, and more precisely that of Edappadi. The DMK camp too is equally confident. “He could have done a lot to improve the constituency, but failed. EPS is a mirage which will disappear in this election,’’ says Sampath Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/tamil-nadu/dmk-may-find-it-tough-to-breach-epss-bastion/articleshow/81621347.cms||V Mayilvaganan
---||India||ED to probe Mumbai ‘extortion racket’, waiting for NIA to share FIR against Waze||NEW DELHI: What started off as a terror probe by the Anti-Terrorism Squad after an SUV laden with gelatin sticks was found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in Mumbai has now expanded into a multi-agency investigation into an alleged terror-cum-extortion racket operated from the commercial capital of India with the alleged blessings of senior ministers and police officers. A top source said the Enforcement Directorate is waiting for the preliminary investigation report from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to launch a money laundering probe under the stringent Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against main accused Sachin Waze, a sub-inspector posted with the Crime Intelligence Unit of Mumbai police and the main suspect in the Ambani terror case. Waze’s call records and allegations made by his superiors have shown that he was directly taking orders from Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. The probe against Waze, who is in NIA custody, is likely to be taken over by the ED to establish the money trail in the alleged terror-cum-extortion racket in which the role of some senior ministers of the Sena-NCP-Congress government is not ruled out. On Saturday, former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh had sent a letter to the chief minister and the governor of Maharashtra stating that Deshmukh had given a target to Waze and some other senior cops for “collection” of Rs 100 crore every month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-to-probe-mumbai-extortion-racket-waiting-for-nia-to-share-fir-against-waze/articleshow/81623594.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Suspended cop writes to additional CS, seeks probe against Param Bir Singh||MUMBAI: In the ongoing saga of mudslinging among senior police officers, a letter by suspended police inspector Anup Dange to additional chief secretary, home, seeking an inquiry into former police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s links with “dubious characters and others who have underworld links” has come to the fore. Dange alleged that a person claiming to be Singh’s relative demanded Rs 2 crore to reinstate him. Singh rubbished the allegations, but declined to elaborate saying the matter is pending in HC. Dange, in his eight-page letter dated February 2, also requested that the departmental probe against him be assigned to a senior IAS officer. “I have sent the letter to the CM and home minister too, but I have not got a reply so far,” Dange told TOI. Dange was suspended for allegedly naming a person in an FIR without sufficient grounds. In November 2019, Dange said he went to check pubs operating in Akruti building at Breach Candy when a pub owner tried to pressurise him to operate beyond the stipulated deadline, claiming he had connections with Param Bir Singh who was then DG state ACB. Later, a scuffle broke out outside the pub and the grandson of film producer Bharat Shah was arrested for allegedly assaulting a cop. The pub-bar owner was also named in the FIR. Dange was suspended on July 18, 2020. He alleged a person claiming to be a cousin of Singh got in touch with him. He later agreed to bring down the amount to Rs 1 crore on behalf of Singh. “I neither had the will nor the capacity to pay such a huge amount,” he has stated. “I don’t have any relatives by that name and I have no connection with him.” Singh told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaisuspended-cop-writes-to-addl-cs-seeks-probe-against-singh/articleshow/81621987.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Hyderabad||Magic mat that can tell you exact outcome of exercise session||Soon, accurately figuring out the impact of a physiotherapy session may no longer be a major pain point for therapists and patients alike. For Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML) may soon be able to help them ascertain, in real time, how productive or effective the physiotherapy session was thanks to a special low-cost sensory mat developed by researchers at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H). Currently, physiotherapists have to rely on cameras and other expensive equipment to track the progress of patients. The intelligent mat developed by researchers at the Processes, Architecture and Technologies Research in IoT (PATRIoT) Lab, Centre for VLSI & Embedded Systems Technologies at IIIT-H uses conductive foam, sensors and an AI algorithm to accurately monitor the speed and accuracy of exercises being done by patients in a session. "The biggest plus of using this system is the ability to quantify a physiotherapy session," said Aftab M Hussain, principal investigator of PATRIoT lab. "In addition to tracking the progress of patients in terms of accuracy of where they’re placing the load, one can also monitor the time taken to place the load. So, with this pressure sensor matrix, we can get both speed and accuracy of load positioning," he explained. He pointed out that the mat can be particularly helpful in restoring physical strength in victims of stroke or arthritis patients, who experience muscle weakness and are prescribed multiple exercises, including one that involves picking up an object from point A and placing it at point B repeatedly, as part of physiotherapy. A key ingredient of this magic exercise mat is conductive foam, which is a polyethylene foam filled with carbon that enables transfer of any static charge. The low-cost, paper-based 4X4 pressure sensor matrix (16 sensors) was fabricated with a layer of paper each on top and the bottom, between which copper electrodes are sandwiched. These electrodes are connected to an external circuit. Each time the foam is pressed (by a patient), there is a reduction in resistance that can be detected with the help of an external circuit. Rather than using mathematical analysis to detect the change in resistance values, the researchers trained a machine learning model to detect the position of loads for various resistances. A comparative analysis between the two methods revealed the superiority of neural networks in load position prediction in a real-world setting. "The neural networks not only help in determining if the load was placed in the correct position but it can also learn from the responses of a person over a period of time," said Anis Fatema, the primary author of the study ‘A Low-Cost Pressure Sensor Matrix for Activity Monitoring in Stroke Patients Using Artificial Intelligence’ that was published in the IEEE Sensors Journal. While the product, which uses a very thin-film fabrication technique, currently costs less than Rs 1,000 per piece, the team is in the process of pushing the envelope even further. "We are trying to see if we can manufacture conductive foam using synthetic organic chemistry. That will further reduce the costs but more importantly, we’ll be able to tweak the properties of foam to better suit our applications and make them more reliable," added Hussain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/magic-mat-that-can-tell-you-exact-outcome-of-exercise-session/articleshow/81621369.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The petitioner had approached the high court against his transfer from 51 Battalion CRPF based in Chandigarh to 217 Battalion CRPF, then deployed in anti-Naxalite operations. His wife is suffering from a ‘complicated chronic disease,’ namely immune theempocyforene, for which she is under treatment at PGI, Chandigarh, through the respondent authorities. In this disease, the blood platelet count is stated to come to an extremely critical level of even zero resulting in blood oozing out of eyes, ears, nose of the wife of the appellant. His petition against the transfer was dismissed on October 24, 2017, by a single bench of the HC after which he had filed a fresh appeal. Hearing his appeal, the division bench on November 10, 2017 stayed his transfer orders. During the hearing of the case on January 27, 2020, the CRPF conceded that the appellant’s wife is suffering from a life-threatening ailment, requiring constant care, and also that the reimbursement of medical expenses is made from the unit where the appellant is posted upon prior certification of the bills by the PGI. On this, the HC asked IG, CRPF, North-West Sector, to transfer and post the appellant at the nearby place so as to facilitate the proper medical care and timely reimbursement of bills in view of the extraordinary facts of the case. When the matter again came up for hearing on February 17, the HC was informed that the appellant has been posted at 13-Battalion, which is stationed in the close vicinity enabling the appellant to take care of his ailing wife’s treatment at PGI and to stand by her in case of any medical complications as also to facilitate the early processing of medical reimbursement. Appreciating the gesture, HC disposed of the matter observing, “We hope and expect that the CRPF and its officers will remain considerate towards the peculiar extraordinary circumstance of the appellant in the new battalion towards the treatment and medical reimbursements as per the entitlements of the appellant”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/crpf-praised-for-swift-response-to-plea-against-transfer-order/articleshow/81621349.cms||Ajay Sura

The move is aimed at involving the locals in wildlife conservation programme and protecting the forest from the timber mafia. The committees have been registered under the Societies Registration Act and will work in coordination with PTR, which is facing an acute staff crunch. Naveen Khandelwal, deputy director of PTR, said each committee would comprise six elected villagers and a forest inspector of PTR as secretary. “The need for the EDCs was felt after the forestry project of JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) expired in 2017. We have a plan to constitute 90 EDCs in villages declared by PTR as ‘sensitive’ and ‘highly sensitive’ from the viewpoint of man-tiger conflict,”said Khandelwal. Naresh Kumar, WWF’s senior project officer, said that the forest department and the WWF would provide the necessary revolving funds to the EDCs to carry out employment and sustenance-based programmes to ensure the linkage of communities living in eco-sensitive zone of PTR to income generation sources. The EDCs would be linked directly with over 10 government departments like health, education, development, public distribution, woman and child care, horticulture, sericulture and Khadi and village industries board to extend direct benefits of the government-sponsored welfare schemes to village people. After setting a concrete platform of development and income generation, the EDCs would expand their activities up to the doorstep at their respective villages as a link between the government departments and the village people for their welfare, Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/6-eco-development-committees-to-assist-wildlife-conservation-programme-in-ptr/articleshow/81619248.cms||Keshav Agarwal

Addressing the two-day state executive meeting of the party to beat out a policy for the next few months as assembly elections are scheduled early next year, the Punjab BJP organisation incharge said the Congress government was responsible for the fiscal mess the state was in and people now regretted by voting it to power in 2017. The BJP functionary said given the tenacity of his party workers in the state and the strength of the organisation, people would form the BJP government in Punjab. BJP’s state executive meeting held on Sunday at the state headquarters in Chandigarh was presided over by the state party president Ashwani Sharma. Launching a scathing attack on Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh for “cleverly skirting” all the major pre-poll monetary promises, BJP national general secretary and incharge Punjab affairs, Dushyant Gautam termed Capt Amarinder’s claims as nothing but a “bundle of lies” to befool the people of Punjab. Gautam said some of the main promises made to SCs included disbursal of the postmatric scholarship on time, clearing backlog in government jobs in a time-bound manner, housing for homeless.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-has-infra-to-contest-all-117-seats/articleshow/81621353.cms||---

Advocate Shadan Farasat mentioned the matter before a bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde and sought urgent listing of the fresh application, in the pending plea, as the pollution level in the Yamuna was very high. Contending that against the backdrop of Holi, the water demand is expected to increase, he insisted the capital was not receiving sufficient water from Haryana and sought an urgent hearing. The top court has scheduled the matter for further hearing on March 25. DJB also said the high level of water pollutants was depleting the quality of water entering from Haryana side. ians||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-to-hear-djbs-plea-over-water-supply-from-haryana/articleshow/81640212.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Kejriwal got Bhagwant Mann to vote for farm law: SAD||Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) alleged on Sunday that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had got his Aam Aadmi Party’s Punjab convener Bhagwant Mann to vote for the BJP-pushed Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, in a parliamentary standing committee meeting on food and consumer affairs, which showed they were “hand in glove with the central government against the farmers”. SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema asked Kejriwal to “apologise to the farmers for Mann’s misleading the farmers at a public function in Moga’s Baghapurana on Sunday.” He accused the Sangrur MP of obliging the Centre on the same issue even earlier. Cheema said: “Mann had he walked out from the Lok Sabha when the Essential Commodities Act was tabled for amendment, but he said the bill was never put to vote: And now his support it proves that Kejriwal sold off the farmers’ interests to the BJP-led central government.” He said that at Baghapurana, Kejriwal had made “a great show of refusing permission for converting stadiums into jails for the agitating farmers but not explained the fortification—the concrete walls, barbed-wire fencing, and iron spikes on the border with Haryana. He told Kejriwal: “It is clear that you cooperated with the Centre to keep the farmers out of Delhi.” Cheema said: “The Sikh youth reported how their articles of faith were insulted in the Tihar jail under Kejriwal’s supervision and how advocates from the Delhi’s advocate general office opposed their bail application. Don’tbe misled by this promise of jobs. The same man took a flase oath on the head of his children that he’d never ally with the Congress or the BJP but formed the government with the Congress support.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kejri-got-bhagwant-mann-to-vote-for-farm-law-sad/articleshow/81621352.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Water scheme: SCB revenue hit as residents stop paying bills||SECUNDERABAD: The state government’s 20 KL free water scheme has dented the Secunderabad Cantonment Board’s (SCB) revenue. The SCB water wing used to earn nearly Rs 3.5 crore through monthly water bills prior to the implementation of the scheme. SCB water wing superintendent M Raj Kumar told TOI that ever since the state government launched the water scheme in December 2020, residents have stopped paying the monthly water bills. “When our officials enquired about non-payment of water bills, the residents claimed that they are also living in Telangana and that the scheme should be applicable to them too. We have issued a clarification to the residents that the SCB will implement the scheme in Cantonment areas once it gets the nod from the state government,” said the SCB official. On the revenue collection, the official said, “We were supposed to receive nearly Rs 1.10 crore through water bills every month, but only 5% of the residents, who pay regularly, have paid,” said Raj Kumar. According to SCB records, over 15,000 consumers receive potable water. After property tax, SCB gets a huge share of revenue from the water wing, which is used for repairs and maintenance of water supply network. “Though the water wing has incurred revenue loss, it has paid the water charges to the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) to avoid interruption in water supply,” he said. Banala Srinivas Reddy, secretary, Cantonment Citizens’ Civic Amenities Development Society, said, “Residents are confused about the scheme as there is no clarity on extending it to Cantonment areas. The then-SCB elected body had moved a proposal in the last board meeting, but it was halted, as extension of the scheme has to be officially declared by the state government.” Meanwhile, the SCB is issuing abnormal water bills to the consumers. “Slum domestic consumers cannot afford the water bills. Unless we get a clarity over water tariffs and the free water scheme, uncertainty for consumers will continue,” a resident of Trimulgherry said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/water-scheme-scb-revenue-hit-as-residents-stop-paying-bills/articleshow/81621355.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Rising cases prelude to 2nd wave: Docs||Lucknow: The spike in Covid-19 cases in the city over the past few days might turn into a second coronavirus wave if immediate measures are not taken by the administration and people fail to follow safety protocols, according to doctors. The positivity rate (samples found positive per 100 people) when the pandemic peaked last year in September was 9.7. Thereafter, there was a steady decline in October (4.9), November (3.5), December (2.8), January (1.5) and February (0.3). The rate was also low in the first week of March but a steady rise was witnessed since March 7. As a result, the case positivity rate in March so far is 0.5, which is higher than February. “It will not take more than 15-20 days for the positivity rate to reach the threshold of a “wave”, as we witnessed in July-August last year, if alarm bells are not sounded now,” said an epidemiologist with the government. “A surge is considered to be a wave when cases increase rapidly, positivity rate reaches 2.5 to 3 and infection source tracing becomes difficult,” he added. Head of microbiology department at KGMU Prof Amita Jain said, “Every pandemic has the tendency to reach the peak followed by a decline and a plateau before surging again. Covid-19 is following the same pattern in many parts of India and the world. In Lucknow, the positivity rate is still within limits, hence, we can call it a prelude to the second wave. It can be prevented if we take precautions like physical distancing, masks, hand hygiene and avoiding big gatherings.” Former head of microbiology department at IMS-BHU Prof Anil Kumar Gulati said, “Immunity developed in a large section of population during the peak in August-September last year would have lost by now because antibodies remain in the body for 3-4 months. The only way to prevent a second wave is to have a strict safety protocol and rapid vaccination of as many people as possible in the shortest possible time.” In charge of Covid hospital at KGMU Prof Sudhir Verma said the number of new cases being reported daily was higher than those who are recovering. “People should consider this as an alarm bell and take due precautions,” he said. Chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar said the situation was very delicate. “If all will take precautions, the threat of a second wave can be averted,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rising-cases-prelude-to-2nd-wave-docs/articleshow/81621993.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The same thing about collecting money, cash for transfer etc were also mentioned in the report submitted by Jaiswal. It was sent to the chief minister but no action has been taken,” said Fadnavis. He demanded a court-appointed committee to probe allegations made in Singh’s letter. Meanwhile, heavy police bandobast turned Anil Deshmukh’s residence at Civil Lines into a virtual fortress following a morcha by BJP’s youth wing. Members of Bharatiya Janata Yuva morcha (BJYM) burnt an effigy of Deshmukh outside his house. Around 17 BJYM protestors were detained. Senior party leaders, including former energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, former mayors Sandip Joshi, Pravin Datke, Archana Dehankar, Anil Sole among others, protested at Samvidhan Chowk . The local unit of NCP retaliated with a similar agitation at the same spot. Anil Ahirkar, president of NCP’s city unit, said, “Just based on allegations should ministers start resigning? This way anyone will come forward and make baseless allegations. And why does the same rule not apply to BJP.” In Mumbai, BJYM led by state president Vikrant Patil agitated outside the state BJP office, while the city unit staged a protest led by Mangal Prabhat Lodha, MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar, Yogesh Sagar and Parag Alawni outside Dadar station. They were detained and later released.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtrabjp-turns-up-the-heat-with-protests-in-maha/articleshow/81621996.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

To mitigate the water problem in the next five months, the SCB water wing has come up with a summer action plan and officials, anticipating a rise in demand for water tankers, have deployed a total of 15 tankers with a capacity of 5,000 litres. “We have added four more tankers, in addition to the existing 11 tankers in case of disruptions in supplies,” said M Raj Kumar, SCB water wing superintendent. On complaints from residents regarding erratic water supply, the official said that frequent power cuts are causing interruptions in the supply. “HMWS&SB is supplying 65 lakh gallons of water per day as per the agreed quantity, but we are supplying water once in three to four days in a week as our water supply network is facing unexpected power problems,” Raj Kumar said. “In view of the huge demand for tanker bookings, four more tanker filling points at Railway Colony, Lothukunta, Bowenpally and Gun Bazaar have been kept ready and timings for filling water at filling points has also been extended from seven hours to 15 hours in single shift and seven hours to 21 hours in two shifts. We are ready to attend repair works at water sumps and reservoirs to avoid inconvenience to our consumers,” said a SCB water wing engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cantt-board-deploys-4-more-tankers-to-tackle-water-issues/articleshow/81621372.cms||---

Owaisi said the MCG should withdraw its decision as it will affect the income of meat sellers, including non-Muslims. He tweeted: “How can beliefs get hurt by what other people are doing in their private lives? People buying, selling or eating meat, they are not forcing you to partake. By this logic, close alcohol shops on Fridays. Meat is food for Millions of Indians. Cannot treat it as something impure (sic).” Owaisi wondered: “Is the country going to be run on the basis of faith or as per the Constitution? The faith of a community cannot be imposed on entire society having people of different faiths.” He said such decisions will spread hatred against non-vegetarians and set a bad precedent that could be followed in other parts of the country. “Is it an attempt to wipe out the beauty of unity in diversity of the country or trying to turn the country into a theocratic state. Presently, we are not a theocratic state,” he said. He went on to ask if the municipal corporation will impose a ban on serving liquor in five-star hotels in Gurugram. “This is a city of economic growth having software firms and star hotels. Such a decision should be withdrawn immediately,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/asad-flays-meat-shop-order-by-gurugram-municipal-corporation/articleshow/81621365.cms||Roushan Ali

The municipal corporation (MC) said it will float tenders before March to lift garbage. After A2Z group, which had signed agreement with the civic body 2011 for 25 years, had called off operations on February 4, the waste processing plant at the main garbage dump site near Kakka village is not working. This has resulted in garbage getting accumulated every day since then. Municipal commissioner Pradeep Sabharwal said they process the garbage soon and that tenders will be floated soon. As garbage hills are becoming prominent at the site, many residents, especially social workers and those involved in public infrastructure and services, said the situation is unprecedented. “Daily about 1,100 metric tonnes garbage is collected from city by the agency concerned and dumped at the main dumping site. As there has been no processing of garbage for last around 45 days, 15-20 lakh metric tonnes must have been accumulated there. I asked a Delhi-based garbage management company about the time it will take to process this much garbage and they told me five to six years for proper processing, that too if they work on it round the clock,” said Kumar Gaurav, a social activist who went to the site a few weeks ago. “Even after A2Z called off operations, small garbage collectors do collect garbage from homes. I heard that partner of A2Z provided 34-35 vehicles to lift garbage from dumping sites from each ward — they are still collecting the garbage and dropping it at the main dumping site. But the problem is with processing. Not many are ready to do it, as money is in lifting garbage from dumps in 95 wards and dropping it at the main dumping site,” he added. The social activist said because of garbage, the people living in the area are facing respiratory issues due to air pollution and water and soil are also getting affected badly. He added that it is also becoming dangerous as 100-150 stray dogs have started foraging garbage for food. “These dumps are bigger than Karnal bypass dumps where garbage from Delhi is dumped,” he added. Meanwhile, those involved in development of infrastructure and services, said the MC can earn money if it manages garbage well. Kapil Arora, president of Council of Engineers, which highlights issues related to public infrastructure and services said, “It is nuisance and main source of air, soil and water pollution, especially during rainy season when toxic substances from dump seep into the soil. If they manage garbage in scientific manner 70-75% problem will be solved. Firstly, the garbage has to be separated into bio-degradable and non-biodegradable from it’s source during door-to-door collection. After that biodegradable stuff can be used for making of manure and methane gas, which is used for electricity generation, as it is being done in some cities of the country. Apart from manure, electricity generation, Gobar gas can be used for income generation. Non-biodegradable stuff like plastic bottles and metals should be sent to respective industries for recycling, which again generates income.” Arora also said wastes like glass, building material and debris can be recycled as well. “A place like Chandigarh’s Rock Garden can be made in the periphery of the city. Cement and concrete in garbage stuff can be crushed in a plant and recycled as building material,” he added. Area residents suffer Gurwinder Singh, sarpanch of Kakka said garbage dump is in 100 qilla (acre) now and indicated that population of 20,000 persons is affected because of it. He added that even as the dump is around 2km from their village, but when wind blows, the foul smell reaches their village and rain makes things bad for them. “We have raised the issue with MC many times and they have assured us that they are working on it,” said the sarpanch. Plastic still a problem Environmentalists said government should enforce policies used for banned substances like plastic that comprises 50% of the garbage. “The impact of such garbage dump is, as the temperature increases, mosquitoes, flies will breed on it and cause diseases. Even though National Green Tribunal has banned manufacture, sale and use of plastic, it is still being used so the government should act on that as well. A significant part of such garbage is biodegradable so there is not much risk associated with that,” said Ravneet Singh, project manager of EcoSikh that works on environmental issues. PPCB keeps a tab on MC Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB)’s senior environmental officer Sandeep Behl said they are waiting for MC’s action and they are giving PPCB some plan on how it will be processed. “We are keeping an eye on things. MC has assured that they are in the process of floating some tenders for processing and PPCB has asked them to indicate a timeline — by what time it will be finalised so that the processing of solid waste can be taken as early as possible. The process should be initiated immediately,” said Behl.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-to-float-tender-by-march-to-clear-mounting-garbe-at-kakka-village/articleshow/81620578.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Chandigarh||5 districts with highest cases are lagging behind in testing||Gurgaon: Five districts in northern Haryana — Karnal, Panchkula, Kurukshetra, Ambala and Yamunanagar — that have among the highest caseload in the state currently have also been found to be lagging in terms of testing. Of the 7,190 Covid cases that Haryana has added to its tally this month, these five districts have together contributed more than half of them — 4,862. In terms of active cases too, Karnal has the highest of them (16.4%), followed by Panchkula (13.3%), Kurukshetra (12.7%), Ambala (11.3%) and Yamunanagar (7.1%). Despite the high number of cases, the rate of testing in these districts has been much lower than that in Gurgaon. While Gurgaon has been testing an average of 57,812 samples for every lakh of its population, none of these five districts has even touched 35,000. The need to ramp up testing in the five districts is all the more because the number of active cases has more than doubled in some of them this month. For instance, Panchkula, which had 124 active cases on March 1, now has 642. Similarly, Karnal’s active cases have gone up from 195 on March 1 to 790. The district has seen a 305% rise in active cases over the past 20 days. Yamunamagar, which had only 47 active patients on March 1, now has 342 people with Covid. Ambala’s active case tally is at 547 and Kurukshetra’s at 612. As of March 20, Haryana had 4,830 active cases, of which 2,933 had been reported from these five districts alone. Officials agreed that the rate of testing was not up to the mark in these five districts. “Yes, it’s true that many districts are lagging behind in the required testing parameters. We have been asking each of them to follow strict testing measures. We will follow the Gurgaon model elsewhere too. We will increase testing in every district,” said Dhruv Chaudhary, the nodal officer for Covid response in Haryana and head of the department of pulmonary and critical care at PGIMS in Rohtak. Not just testing, surveillance has also been a cause for concern in many of these districts. Data revealed that the average number of contacts traced for each Covid patient is 9.9 in Ambala, 10 in Kurukshetra and 10.1 in Karnal, lower than the state average of 10.8. However, Yamunanagar (11) and Pachkula (12) are better in terms of contact tracing. Testing and tracing of contacts of patients are key to curb the spread of the infection. If contacts are traced within days and their samples tested immediately, it helps the administration ensure timely treatment of patients and prevent them from getting critical. The rising cases in Haryana have worried neighbouring states too. Rajasthan, for instance, has set up a testing booth at the Shahjahanpur border on the Delhi-Jaipur highway. Only those travellers who have a negative RT-PCR report not older than 72 hours are being allowed into Rajasthan. Those without the report are being either turned back from the border or tested at the booth there with consent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/5-districts-with-highest-cases-are-lagging-behind-in-testing/articleshow/81621373.cms||Ipsita Pati

---||Delhi||Amid stir, Lok Sabha passes bill identifying ‘govt’ in Delhi with LG||NEW DELHI: Amid strong opposition from Aam Aadmi Party and Congress, Lok Sabha on Monday passed the Bill that makes it clear that the “government” in Delhi means the “Lieutenant Governor”. The opposition called it “unconstitutional”, while Union MoS Home G Kishan Reddy said the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, has become necessary as there has been ambiguity in certain issues related to the functioning of Delhi government. According to the Bill, the “government” in Delhi means the “lieutenant governor” and it also makes it mandatory for Delhi government to take the opinion of the LG before any executive action. CM Arvind Kejriwal called the passage of the Bill an “insult” to the people of Delhi “Please do not say that it is a political Bill. It is being brought to end ambiguity in certain issues as Delhi is a Union territory. It will end certain confusion or technicality and enhance the efficiency of the administration,” Reddy said, rejecting the opposition charge that its passage was “murder of democracy”. The minister clarified that when the GNCTD Act was enacted in 1991 by the then Congress government, Delhi was made a Union territory with an assembly with “limited legislative powers”. “We have not snatched any power from Delhi government nor have we given any additional power to the LG,” he said, adding that the LG is an administrator so he has the right to know the day-to-day affairs. The minister said the amendments were intended to bring in more transparency. Initiating the debate, Congress MP Manish Tewari said the bill was “unconstitutional” and it takes away certain rights of the city government, which were given under a constitutional amendment. Defending the amendments, BJP’s Meenakashi Lekhi, Lok Sabha MP from New Delhi, said the Bill seeks to rectify the alleged mismanagement of Delhi and questioned why Congress did not give Delhi full statehood. Bhagwant Mann of AAP alleged that the Cente was a “specialist in abusing” the rights of states and wanted to rule Delhi through “Soul of Viceroy”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/amid-stir-ls-passes-bill-identifying-govt-in-delhi-with-lg/articleshow/81640216.cms||---
---||Ranchi||BJP to oppose debate on Centre’s new farm laws in Jharkhand assembly today||RANCHI: Opposition BJP on Sunday vehemently criticised the state government’s decision to debate upon the recently enacted farm laws in Jharkhand Assembly on Monday and said that they are going to strongly oppose the move. With just two days left for the ongoing Budget session to conclude, the mahagathbandhan government of JMM-Congress-RJD, which has opposed the three contentious laws ever since they were enacted in October last year, will hold discussions on it with an aim to pass a resolution against them, government sources said. BJP’s leader of legislative party Babulal Marandi said, “We have learnt that the government will hold a debate on the farm laws in the House tomorrow. It is unconstitutional to debate on laws enacted by the Parliament. By doing so, the government will set a wrong example. BJP will strongly oppose it in the House.” Asked why he chose to voice his party’s opinion ahead of Monday’s debate, Marandi said, “I am sure the speaker will not allow us to speak tomorrow. That is why I chose to speak today.” The former chief minister came down heavily on the Congress, accusing it of adopting a dual stand on the farm laws just for political gains. He said, “During the UPA regime, the Union government had proposed to dissolve the agriculture produce markets (mandis). Now under the new farm laws, the Modi government has given farmers the option to sell their produce at a place of their choice, besides government mandis. There are several such revolutionary clauses in the new laws to make the farmers progressive but Congress is only opposing it for the sake of doing so.” He added, “The party is giving rise to anarchy and spreading false propaganda as they have now realised that the good work of the Modi government will not allow them to return to power ever again.” Meanwhile, the grand old party hit back at BJP and said that instead of shying away from it, the opposition should debate and defend the farm laws based on their merits in the assembly on Monday. “If the farm laws are so good then why is BJP afraid of discussing it in the state assembly? Why are thousands of farmers protesting against them for months?” party spokesperson Alok Dubey said, adding, “Instead of giving statements in the media, BJP should defend the so-called merits of the laws in the House.” He further said, “BJP is afraid because they know that the laws were framed unconstitutionally through an ordinance and without any legitimate debate amid the pandemic.” Lal Kishorenath Shahdeo, another spokesperson, said, “Many states like Delhi, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh have passed a resolution against the farm laws through debates in their respective assemblies. The state government is constitutionally right in debating the laws in the assembly and pass resolution by a majority vote, if it sees that the laws aren’t in favour of the farmers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-to-oppose-debate-on-centres-new-farm-laws-in-jharkhand-assembly-today/articleshow/81619824.cms||ASRP Mukesh

According to the data released by the state health department, a total of 2,55,887 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the last 48 hours; 1,15,715 were given the jab on Saturday and 1,40,172 on Sunday. The total number of beneficiaries above 60 years was 2,13,564 and the rest 42,323 were those with co-morbidity between 45-59 years. Talking to TOI, MD NHM Ravishankar Shukla said: “I would like to thank the members of the self-help groups, anganwadi sevikas, sahiyas, vaccinators as well as our data-entry operators, among others. All of them played a vital role in the success of the drive. I am delighted to share that one of our session site in-charge at a remote block handled the portal smoothly by carrying out face authentication.” Palamu emerged as the top district during the drive by inoculating a total of 23,435 beneficiaries in the last two days. The district administered 10,989 beneficiaries on Saturday, while the number rose to 12,446 on Sunday. Palamu deputy commissioner Shashi Ranjan said: “Meticulous planning, mobilisation of beneficiaries and the hard work of our staff contributed to the result. I would also thank members of JSLPS and anganwadi sevikas, who played a pivotal role in getting the maximum number of beneficiaries to the centres.” Meanwhile, a 107-year-old Makina Khatun of Bhojpur under Markachho block took the vaccine on Sunday. She is the oldest woman in the state. Khatun said that she didn’t experience any difficulty after receiving the jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/1st-phase-of-special-vax-drive-crosses-target-figure-by-50k/articleshow/81620627.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Poster campaign to curb mob lynching||Ranchi: Police on Sunday launched a mass awareness drive across Ranchi district to prevent mob lynching through poster campaigns in the wake of two back-to-back incidents of lynchings in the capital district. The posters highlighted dos and don'ts to avert lynchings and the campaign will include other activities like street plays and public meetings among others in the coming days. Talking to TOI SSP S K Jha said that even though police are always on their toes to prevent such heinous crimes, it is impossible without people’s cooperation. “Hence, we have begun the mega awareness drive across the district against lynching,” Jha, adding that they are also roping in social groups at police station levels to intensify the drive. Between March 8 and 15 this year, two youths were lynched by mobs under Kotwali and Angara police station areas in Ranchi on suspicion of theft. The incidents have rocked the Jharkhand assembly where the budget session is going on with opposition BJP trying to put the state government in the dock over "failing law and order" in the capital. The posters also highlighted that being part of a mob involved in lynching is a crime and will attract legal action. People are asked to inform the police immediately in cases any mob resorts to assault. Jha said, "The identity of informants of such incidents will be kept confidential. In the posters, we have also included police control room numbers where anyone can inform us about any such incidents anywhere in the district." Jha further said they are planning to hold meetings with village and panchayat heads to seek their participation in creating awareness. "We have also come up with audio capsules for greater dissemination of anti-lynching messages through mobile vans and via radio platforms. Street plays are also being chalked out in local languages to sensitise the rural population,” he said, adding that while police try their best to arrest the criminals for speedy prosecution in lynching cases, but educating the public is the first step to prevent such happenings. In recent years, alleged lynchings related to theft, cow smuggling and other crimes have emerged as one of the biggest menaces in the state. According to data compiled by the Jharkhand Janadhikar Manch, a conglomeration of social and rights groups, at least 19 persons were lynched between 2014 and 2019 when BJP was in power. The trend also continued even after the Hemant Soren government came into power, the manch said in a statement after the Angara lynching incident last week. It also demanded to frame of anti-lynching laws and implementation of various directives by the Supreme Court on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/poster-campaign-to-curb-mob-lynching/articleshow/81620584.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||‘Most new infections mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic’||Ranchi: Most of the new Covid-19 infections in Jharkhand are mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic, health experts said on Sunday. Dr Rakesh Dayal, state surveillance officer of Covid-19, told TOI on Sunday, “There has been a rise in Covid-19 cases in the past couple of weeks, but according to the reports received by us, the new cases are mostly mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic.” Dayal said district health machineries have been directed to keep a tab on the condition of infected people. “In case their conditions deteriorate, they are to be moved to Covid-19 hospitals and Covid Care Centers (CCC),” he added. At present, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients are to remain in home isolation under watch of respective district health machinery. The state reported 123 new infections and the number of active caseload surpassed the 700 mark on Saturday. While the threat of a second wave looms, the department said it has instructed district health machineries to prep up CCCs, which were set up in non-medical facilities during the peak of the pandemic. Health experts in the state are drawing hope from the fact that the mortality rate across the country has dropped to 0.78% since January this year. “This implies that the second wave, if it at all strikes, will be less dangerous,” another health official said. As government-run Covid-19 designated hospitals are prepping up for an influx of patients, Ranchi’s private hospitals are witnessing a rise in the patient inflow. Talking to TOI, medical director of Shree Bhagwan Mahaveer Medica Superspecialty hospital Dr Vijay Mishra said, “Currently we have 31 covid-19 patients under treatment at our hospital, of which 12 are in the NICU. Earlier we used to get five patients in a week’s time, but now it has gone up to seven patients on a daily basis.” On being contacted, senior pulmonologist at Orchid Medical Centre Dr Nishit Kumar said, “We have 17 dedicated beds for Covid patients and all are occupied. The patient inflow had decreased to negligible in December last year and January this year. However, it has increased and as we are getting at least three patients on a daily basis. We are also contemplating on increasing the number of beds at our Covid-19 ward.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/most-new-infections-mildly-symptomatic-or-asymptomatic/articleshow/81620490.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The cops recently returned stolen items worth over Rs 10 lakh to the owners after carrying out detailed verification.“Earlier, the recovered valuables used to remain stored in the police station for a long time. Anxious owners had to wait for months to get back their valuables. “Once we have arrested the burglars and recovered the stolen items, the right thing to do is hand it over to the owners. It is pointless to store such valuables in the police station,” Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner, told TOI. The cops recently returned 36 stolen motorbikes, two auto-rickshaws, one car, 37 mobile phones and six gold and silver ornaments recovered from thieves. The police said that in the coming days, such stolen items recovered from the thieves will be returned to the owners swiftly.

---||Ranchi||JMM’s Hafizul to file nomination for Madhupur bypoll on March 25||RANCHI: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha’s (JMM) Madhupur bypoll candidate Hafizul Hassan will file his nomination papers on March 25 in the presence of chief minister Hemant Soren, party sources in Ranchi hinted on Sunday. On the other hand, the state unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hopeful that its parliamentary board, under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will zero in on the party’s Madhupur candidate by Monday evening. Madhupur, which fell vacant after the death of Haji Hussain Ansari, will go to vote on April 17. The results will be announced on May 2. JMM , however, is yet to formally announce Hassan’s name as candidate. BJP’s state election committee under its president Deepak Prakash shortlisted five probable candidates and forwarded the list to the party’s parliamentary board for deliberation and subsequent approval on Saturday. Topping the list of probable candidates is former state labour minister and two-time Madhupur MLA Raj Paliwar and Ajsu Party’s 2019 candidate Ganganarayan Singh. Vishakha Singh, the wife of former BJP Rajya Sabha MP Jaiprakash Narayan Singh (who was elected to office in 2008), and long-time party worker Suraj Yadav are the other two contenders for Madhupur. State party president Deepak Prakash told TOI: “Our candidate will be named in a day or two. We are confident of winning the seat as the people of Jharkhand and Madhupur are fed up of lawlessness prevailing under the governance of the incumbent JMM-Congress-RJD coalition.” While the battle for Madhupur is stacked as a direct contest between JMM and BJP, both the camps are expected to get the support of their respective allies. Besides Soren, cabinet ministers from Congress are likely to canvass for Hassan. Meanwhile, BJP can induct Ganganarayan into its fold if he is named candidate. “With the party’s national leadership giving Baghmundi seat in West Bengal to Ajsu Party, its president Sudesh Mahto will support and canvass for our candidate,” a senior BJP office bearer said. Like Madhupur, the bypoll to the Dumka assembly seat last year was a direct contest between JMM and BJP. In Bermo, the BJP locked horns with the Congress. Both the outings were unsuccessful for BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmms-hafizul-to-file-nomination-for-madhupur-bypoll-on-march-25/articleshow/81619837.cms||Dhritiman Ray

In the last five days, Ranchi district has seen 224 new cases. Talking to TOI, state health secretary K K Soan said, “Although the spike in the number of cases is not major, we are keeping ourselves ready and we are sure to tackle the situation and there is nothing to be worried. Officials have been instructed to make necessary arrangements.” As per health department records, till Sunday morning, Jharkhand had 722 active cases, of which more than 220 have been reported in the last 48 hours. Ranchi, which has reported the maximum number of cases, has a total of 387 active cases followed by East Singhbhum with 123. In Ranchi, three hospitals, including the state’s only tertiary care centre Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), Ranchi district hospital and Central Hospital of Central Coalfields Limited, Gandhinagar, have been designated as Covid Care Centres. The total capacity at these hospitals is around 350 beds which include ICU and CCU beds. Talking to TOI, Ranchi civil surgeon Dr V B Prasad said, “We held a meeting with all stakeholders last week and decided that patients with no symptoms and mild symptoms will be admitted at the Covid Care Centres at the Ranchi district hospital and Central Hospital. People with moderate and high symptoms along with co-morbidities will be treated at Rims.” Preparations are complete at Rims with two floors of the paying ward and the ground floor of the new trauma centre being made operational two days ago for Covid-19 patients. “We had reduced the number of beds for Covid-19 patients a month ago as there were very few patients getting admitted due to a decline in fresh infections,” said Dr Pradeep Kumar Bhattacharya, head, trauma centre and professor of critical care at Rims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/with-spike-in-cases-govt-reopens-cov-care-centres-mobilises-health-workers/articleshow/81620605.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The village is a part of the Simaria block, which is a rebel-hit area. The women were given training in making furniture by the Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion Society (JSLPS), an arm of the state rural development department. Many of the women said their husbands didn’t like the idea at first. But undaunted by the negative reaction, a group of 10 women not only took the training but also procured bank loans to set up the business. One of the women, Sharda Devi, said, “We have become atma-nirbhar now. We are supplying furniture to other districts and are being able to make out a decent living.” She added that her husband no longer objects to her work. Bajida Khatoon said, “We have proved the critics wrong by being able to do this work successfully.” Block development officer Amit Kumar Mishra also lauded the efforts of these women and asked people to cooperate with them.

About a month ago, an ASI team from Bihar had discovered more than 10 Buddha statues of different sizes after which a few were shifted to the ASI museum in Patna as there was no place to preserve them in Hazaribag while the others were in the process of being shifted and left at the site with tight security, which included four policemen and an assistant sub-inspector, village volunteers and six guards from ASI. On Sunday morning, a few locals saw two of the idols were missing when they ventured into the forests to collect mahua flowers. Hazaribag SDO Vidya Bhushan Kumar, who rushed to the spot, confirmed the theft. “We have launched a probe to recover the statues,” he said. SP Kartik S and deputy commissioner Aditya Kumar Anand too reached the spot. A source said while one of the two stolen statues is of six-feet high, the other is around four-and-half feet. Sources said on Saturday night, the ASI guards did not turn up and the remaining security personnel along with the village volunteers could not give a satisfactory reply as to how the statues went missing. Police have alerted all stations and set up check posts at several places leading to Ranchi, Bagodar, Barhi and other areas on NH-33, NH-2 and NH-100 to recover the statues. “It appears that the theft was pre-planned as it is not an easy affair to steal such big idols,” a villager said. The discovery of the idols was also discussed in the ongoing budget session when two BJP MLAs — Raj Sinha (Dhanbad) and Amar Kumar Bauri (Chandankyari) — asked the government about the plans to preserve the idols. The government has said they will not allow the statues to go outside of the state and suitable arrangements will be made to safeguard them within Jharkhand. State agriculture minister Badal Patralekh, replying on behalf of the government, had assured the House that the matter was also discussed with chief minister Hemant Soren and the chief secretary was directed to see that the idols do not go outside of Jharkhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/2-buddha-statues-stolen-from-asi-excavation-site-in-hazaribag/articleshow/81620642.cms||Abhijit Sen

The passengers, which included children and a few senior citizens, complained that they were not provided with any assistance and were left to fend for themselves. The fliers said that Air India flight AI994, which was to arrive at Goa International Airport at 4.35pm, was cancelled at the last minute. The flight was then scheduled to fly to Mumbai. “I think the flight had gone there yesterday and was supposed to come today,” said an AAI official. Passengers complained that they were not provided with any food or given any accommodation by Air India. “Air India cancelled flight in Dubai has us waiting in the airport for over 13 hours. No intimation, no hotels, no food, no direction, no staff in sight, plane load of passengers aimlessly waiting around,” said Mumbai-based creative professional Tanishaa Cunha. Cunha said that no social distancing was maintained which put the passengers at risk of contracting Covid. Nikita Shah, another flier who had a ticket to fly to Goa said that no representative from Air India came forward to help the passengers. “We’re not given any accommodation, nothing! What rubbish is this,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cancelled-dubai-goa-flight-leaves-300-stranded/articleshow/81621397.cms||---

Scientists say that this is being caused because of a trough running from coastal Karnataka to central Maharashtra, across Goa at 1.5km height above mean sea level. “The system is persisting and is brining moisture. It will continue for a few days,” IMD scientist, Rahul M said.  IMD, in its initial summer forecast for March-May, said that the day temperatures are likely to be above normal in various parts of India. IMD Goa said that there is possibility of slight increase in day time maximum temperature from present values over Goa by around one degree on March 24 and 25, but no indication of a heat wave. “With present observations, we cannot say that Goa is going to experience a heat wave. The average maximum temperature of March, April and May this year will be around 0.25 degrees higher than its normal value. There has been no heatwave forecast for Goa for at least the coming five days,” Rahul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-to-receive-light-rain-in-next-three-days-imd/articleshow/81621411.cms||---
---||India||Suspended inspector alleges Param Bir has ‘links to underworld’||MUMBAI: In the ongoing saga of mudslinging among senior police officers, a letter by suspended police inspector Anup Dange to additional chief secretary, home, seeking an inquiry into former police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s links with “dubious characters and others who have underworld links” has come to the fore. He has alleged Singh through a relative demanded Rs 2 crore to reinstate him. Singh rubbished the allegations but declined to elaborate saying the matter is pending in HC. Dange, in his letter dated February 2, also requested that the departmental probe against him be assigned to a senior IAS officer. “I have sent the letter to the CM and home minister too, but haven’t got a reply so far,” Dange told TOI. Dange was suspended for allegedly naming a person in an FIR without sufficient grounds. In November 2019, Dange said he went to check pubs operating in Akruti building at Breach Candy when a pub owner tried to pressurise him to operate beyond the stipulated deadline, claiming he had connections with Param Bir Singh who was then DG state anti-corruption bureau. TOI had on November 24, 2019 reported the incident where the grandson of film producer Bharat Shah was arrested for allegedly assaulting a cop. Dange was suspended on 18 July, 2020. He alleged a person identifying himself as a cousin of Singh got in touch with him and that they met at the Prabhadevi residence of the ‘cousin’. After negotiations, he agreed to reduce the demand to Rs 1 crore on behalf of Singh. “I neither had the will nor the capacity to pay this amount,” he said. He also claimed Singh tried to scuttle the probe into assault case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/suspended-inspector-alleges-param-bir-has-links-to-underworld/articleshow/81623574.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The directorate of technical education (DTE) was awaiting the schedule of the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) to decide on the GCET dates. As some students from Goa attempt both tests, DTE wanted to ensure that NEET and GCET dates do not clash. Sources said that a file has been sent to the state government for approval proposing that GCET be held on June 19 and 20. The dates have been proposed as the Class XII exams of the central boards as well as the state board is expected to end by this time and students will also get sufficient time to prepare for Goa Common Entrance Test. Around 3,000 students answer GCET each year. GCET, which is usually held on May 4 and 5 in a regular year, has been delayed this in the academic year because of the pandemic. The prospectus for admissions to professional degree programmes seats in Goa for the academic year 2021-22 is expected to be released by last week of March, DTE officials said. The prospectus announces the schedule for admission to engineering, pharmacy, medicine, dentistry, ayurveda, homeopathy, nursing and five allied health programmes. While admissions to engineering and pharmacy degree seats take place through the GCET, entry to the other programmes is based on students’ performance in the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test . The prospectus to be released by March-end will contain details of courses, seats, eligibility and merit criteria, rules and procedures for admissions and schedule for rounds of admissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/this-year-gcet-likely-to-be-held-on-june-19-and-20/articleshow/81621417.cms||---

Aimed at creating a strategic unit to develop, maintain and implement the multi-sectoral energy action plan, the MoU has been inked on the advice of the Union ministry for new and renewable energy. “The strategic unit will function as a ‘state think tank’ and will be a repository of all relevant data. It will develop a 100% renewable energy roadmap, energy plan, energy action plan and appropriate decision support tools for Goa. It will provide technical assistance and support to implement priority recommendation(s) of the energy action plan(s) for the state,” a senior officer said While the MoU clearly lays down the broader mandates of technical cooperation with the electricity department and the Goa Energy Development Authority, a detailed list of activities will be separately agreed in writing between the parties. The German company will provide technical assistance in setting up a multi-sectoral strategic unit (or PMU) and provide necessary technical assistance in developing a 100 % renewable energy roadmap along with appropriate decision support tools. It will also provide technical assistance to monitor, report and modify components of the renewable energy roadmap through organizing periodic steering committee meetings and subsequently provide technical assistance to implement mutually agreed upon priority activities. The electricity department will coordinate with key departments and steer the process of developing the renewable energy roadmap as well as state energy plan in consultation with GIZ and its partners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-signs-renewable-energy-mou-with-german-company/articleshow/81621448.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa becoming increasingly water stressed: Experts||KERI: On International Water Day, environmentalists said that Goa has increasingly begun to show signs of being water stressed over the years. They attributed this to unplanned tourism, unmonitored mining activities, deforestation, insufficient sewage treatment plants and garbage disposal facilities. Fresh water levels in the state’s main rivers, like the Mhadei and Zuari, have considerably reduced. Global warming and climate change phenomena, too, are adding to this water stress. Goa, among other measures, has formed 86 Water Users Associations to handle, operate and maintain the network of distributaries and water courses in its command areas. But these measures may need to be backed with other steps to protect the state’s forests, to take up reforestation, to improve agricultural methods upstream, and to help better the water quality, experts said. The main source of ground water recharge in Goa is the monsoonal rainfall that varies from about 2,500mm along the coast to about 4,500mm towards the Western Ghats. “Water stress conditions arise wherever the quantity of ground water extracted within a given watershed exceeds the total recharge. In the coastal region, water withdrawals are mainly on account of tourism, high population density and to some extent industrial use. Natural hydrogeological conditions also add to the salinity intrusion in coastal aquifers. In the hinterland, mining activities have affected aquifers,” an environmentalist said. A study by G T Marathe of IIT Mumbai has shown that open cast mining of iron ore affected ground water. In the belt between Usgao and Honda, the study recorded a marked drop in the ground water level from 55m to 35m above mean sea level, between 1960 and 1980. Also, the non-availability of sufficient drinking water has been forcing wild animals to move out of the natural habitat, thereby intensifying man-wildlife conflict. Most of the fresh water lakes in Goa once served as rain-fed reservoirs. However, today, many of these lakes are threatened by weed infestation, anthropogenic pressure, siltation and various developmental activities undertaken in a haphazard manner. Meanwhile, the Karnataka government since 2006 has been unilaterally violating the provision of Forest Conservation Act of 1980 and of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 by undertaking construction of a huge canal in Kankumbi to divert the natural flow of the Kalasa rivulet going in the direction of the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. Considering the projected water needs of Goa till 2050, it has been established by the 1998 masterplan that Mhadei is a water deficit basin and hence no scope exists for water diversion. Yet, Karnataka has planned to undertake dozens of projects of damming and diverting various tributaries of the Mhadei. If these plans materialise, then Goa will face serious water issues in the near future. “In the coming days, if serious thought and sincere efforts are not made to protect the forests cover of the land and its eco-sensitivity, the future of water in Goa will be bleak. Despite the various tall promises made during elections of providing smooth drinking water supply, in reality, citizens are found protesting for daily water supply even during the rains,” an expert said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-becoming-increasingly-water-stressed-experts/articleshow/81621491.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

Health authorities appear to have taken solace in the fact that most of the patients testing positive can be treated in home isolation or Covid Care Centres (CCCs). Sources in the health department say there are 240 beds available at Chandrapur Government Medical College and Hospital and additional 100 bed facility has been raised at Government Women’s Hospital in the city. The two facilities have 50 and 9 ICU beds, respectively, equipped with ventilators. Moreover, 300 beds equipped with oxygen facility is being readied at the Women’s Hospital, but the work appears to have no deadline. With rising cases, at least three private hospitals in Chandrapur have been again authorized to treat Covid patients with capped rates of treatment. Two oxygen plants, promised by guardian minister earlier at GMCH and district hospital, are still under construction. However, officials are content with the fact that they have stock of 500 jumbo oxygen cylinders at the hand. Administration has once again ordered to revive the CCCs, closed down after de-escalation of previous Covid surge. “Average 125 to 150 patients are being detected in Chandrapur every day. With 80% of them being asymptomatic or having mild symptoms, the available facility is sufficient to deal with the present situation. Health department is adding more facilities, while administration is authorizing more private hospitals for treatment,” said GMCH dean Dr Arun Humne. Availability of doctors at GMCH and Women’s Hospital remains the same as earlier. Not a single vacancy of faculties and doctors required at GMCH has been filled despite the raging pandemic. Sources said there are as many as 79 vacancies of faculties and doctors at GMCH and the hospital is functioning with just over half of the total sanctioned posts. caption Under construction oxygen plant at Chandrapur GMCH||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-surges-again-chanda-admin-yet-to-ramp-up-infra/articleshow/81620677.cms||Mazhar Ali

On Sunday, district magistrate Suhas LY convened an online meeting with more than six RWAs, village, traders and industrial associations, along with the senior police officers and health department officials to discuss steps that can be taken in an attempt to control the spread of the disease. While the focus was on ensuring that public places and markets do not see crowds, RWAs were asked to encourage residents to take the vaccine and reactivate nigrani samitis to step up vigil. The DM also emphasised on following Covid protocols and asked health officials and RWAs to ensure that residents use the Aarogya Setu app and dispose Covid waste according to protocols. More than 90 members from the Federation of Noida Residents’ Welfare Associations (FONRWA), Noida Extension Flat Owners’ and Members’ Association (Nefoma), Noida Federation of Apartment Owners’ Associations (Nofaa), Confederation of NCR Residents’ Welfare Association (CONRWA), District Development Residents’ Welfare Association (DDRWA), NGOs, village federations and Apartment Owners’ Associations AOAs) attended the meeting. Police commissioner Alok Singh, joint commissioner Love Kumar, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP) Ran Vijay Singh and chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri were also present. “Expressing concern over the recent spurt, the DM urged everyone to help implement the guidelines issued by Government of India and the state government. We spoke to him about the weekly markets where thousands of people assemble and most of them do not wear masks. Following social distancing norms is not possible in such crowded places. We have asked that fines be imposed on people where necessary. CP Alok Singh assured us that police personnel would be deployed in these places and they will also organise awareness programmes for residents,” said KK Jain, secretary general, FONRWA. He added that they also discussed protocols for the upcoming Holi celebrations. “Several RWAs organise cultural programmes and other events for Holi. This time, many RWAs have said that they are yet to get permits for such programmes. The DM said an online system would be set up and such requests would be looked into,” said Jain. While health officials have ensured that the testing drive would be stepped up, along with contact tracing, the DM has sought help from RWAs in identifying people coming into the city from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala and other places where the cases are high. “We discussed how to control the situation in the weekly markets and metro trains. The police commissioner will deploy his teams to generate awareness among residents and ensure that Covid protocols are followed,” said the DM. Later in the night, the police commisioner initiated an awareness drive through public address systems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/promote-vax-drive-and-step-up-covid-vigil-rwas-told/articleshow/81621545.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

GCZMA has now given the owners one last opportunity to carry out the demolition. The GCZMA had earlier asked for a demolition plan to be submitted by the violators. The coastal body has now said that if the demolition plan is not received within a time prescribed by it, the North Goa collector would carry out the demolition of the offending structure. This demolition will be carried out at the cost of the violator and environmental damages and cost of restoring the land to the original state will be recovered from those who constructed the structure. The GCZMA had first noticed the illegality at Ozran, Vagator, on December 7, 2020, after locals protested against the beach stretch at Ozran being renamed as ‘Sunburn beach’ by the hotel owners. Expert members inspected the site and found that the structure was constructed in violation of CRZ regulations. The expert member told GCZMA that ‘the structure is massive in nature and considering the extent of the illegality committed without taking any permissions, a stop work order should be issued and a fine should be imposed on the owner of the structure. The hotel premises were accordingly sealed and barred for any commercial activities at the structure. When called for a personal hearing, the owners sought time to appear due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Later, the lawyer for the violators cited a MoEF&CC notification dated February, 2021 and sought a joint inspection of the premises. The authority, however, said that the owners of the structure at Vagator are not entitled to benefits under the new notification. The coastal body also stated that there is no need for an inspection as one has taken place already. Therefore, a last opportunity has been given to demolish the illegal structure at Ozran coast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/3-months-on-illegal-beach-club-in-vagator-crz-yet-to-be-razed/articleshow/81621555.cms||---

GFP president Vijai Sardesai questioned the need for Karnataka Police to verbally abuse Goan officers, confiscate their IDs during the joint inspection, which was ordered by the Supreme Court. “We urge Karnataka and its police force to duly permit and not obstruct the due proceedings of the joint inspection committee. We hope that your government and police force value and respect the orders of the Supreme Court as an action of prudence and not a ruling on a piece of paper,” Sardesai said. The letter also called for a swift and prompt response and called on Karnataka Police to rectify their actions and avoid repetition of the “unfortunate incident” at Kankumbi. A joint inspection team comprising Goa’s water resources department officers which had gone to inspect the site on March 19, were restrained by local police and even verbally abused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shocked-over-misuse-of-power-gfp-to-ktaka-cm/articleshow/81621593.cms||---

---||India||BJP ups attack on Uddhav, says he can’t stay in office||NEW DELHI/PATNA: BJP on Sunday stepped up its attack on Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray, with several senior members seeking a CBI probe into ex- Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh’s allegations while saying that Uddhav had lost the moral authority to be in office. BJP also questioned NCP chief Sharad Pawar for his “conspicuous” and “ominous” silence despite having had knowledge about the “extortion” allegations involving party colleague Anil Deshmukh, who is Maharashtra home minister. Singh, in a letter to the CM and the governor, had said Deshmukh had asked arrested “encounter” cop Sachin Waze to raise Rs 100 crore a month from Mumbai’s dance bars and restaurants. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said if Thackeray had any propriety, he should recommend a CBI inquiry and should not continue in office. Senior party members like BL Santhosh, CT Ravi and former CM Devendra Fadnavis too demanded Deshmukh’s resignation and a thorough probe. Prasad said the late Bal Thackeray’s slogan was “Jai Maharashtra” but Uddhav Thackeray was heading a “loot agadhi”. “This government is abusing power like never before. Need to make them quit early and save Maharashtra,” Santhosh tweeted. In Patna, Prasad said BJP would hit the streets in Maharashtra against “operation loot” going on there. “BJP wants a fair and transparent probe by an outside agency into this murky government loot,” he said. He questioned Pawar and Thackeray’s motives in defending Waze. “I’ve never heard of a CM or a senior member like Pawar defending an assistant police inspector-rank officer,” he said. Prasad sought answers from MVA partners including Thackeray and Pawar. “The disturbing question is why Waze was reinstated after years of suspension, that too during Covid? Why an SI-level officer was given such an important case?” he asked. Prasad said Pawar was not part of the government and asked in what capacity he was briefed by police commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-ups-attack-on-uddhav-says-he-cant-stay-in-office/articleshow/81623609.cms||---

This had led to a major embarrassment for former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. In less than a week after BJP government supported by NCP’s Ajit Pawar lost majority, Singh had submitted an affidavit in the high court giving a clean chit to Pawar in the irrigation scam case. Singh then headed Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). His predecessor Sanjay Barve had, however, fixed Pawar’s responsibility in the case. This led to an embarrassment for former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who was not only ditched by Pawar, but the latter also got a clean chit in the irrigation scam case. The BJP was voted to power after it contested the election raising the irrigation scam issue and Fadnavis became chief minister for the first term. Now when reminded of the case, Fadnavis said notwithstanding what had happened, Singh’s allegations cannot be ignored. “The officer’s letter also includes transcripts of SMS and WhatsApp messages as proof which cannot be ignored. It’s not that a retired officer has made any allegations...Singh is very much in service,” said Fadnavis. He also stressed Singh is not the only person who has submitted any such information about functioning of the home department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/parambir-clean-chit-to-ajit-had-embarrassed-bjp/articleshow/81620903.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nagpur||Show of strength: BJP & NCP spar over Anil Deshmukh||Nagpur: Heavy police bandobast turned home minister Anil Deshmukh’s residence at Civil Lines into a virtual fortress and the road in front was barricaded for about 300 metres on both sides following a morning morcha by BJP’s youth wing. As part of their statewide agitation to demand his resignation in the backdrop of a letter written by former Mumbai top cop Parambir Singh and Sachin Vaze’s arrest, members of Bharatiya Janata Yuva morcha (BJYM) burnt an effigy of Deshmukh outside his house. Around 17 BJYM protestors were detained from the spot. Similarly, senior party leaders, including former energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, former mayors Sandip Joshi, Pravin Datke, Archana Dehankar, Anil Sole among others, protested at Samvidhan Chowk and demanded that Deshmukh steps down from his post. “Deshmukh has lost the moral authority to continue as HM. When someone from his own department is making such big allegation of money collection, it needs to be looked into without bias,” said Bawankule, adding that stepping down from the post following allegations is “part of the state’s cultural ethos”. The BJP collected money in a bowl which Bawankule said would be handed over to the collector to be given to Deshmukh. The local unit of NCP shot back with a similar agitation at the same spot, questioning the logic behind the resignation demand. Anil Ahirkar, president of NCP’s city unit, said, “Just based on allegations should ministers start resigning? This way anyone will come forward and make baseless allegations. And why does the same rule not apply to BJP. In Nagpur itself we have seem their leaders amass huge properties within five years, and it’s visible to everyone. How is it possible to do all this in such a short span of time.” NCP leaders also symbolically cracked a few watermelons on the road. With there being a ban on any kind of political rallies and strict implementation of Covid distancing norms, the cops acted on the protestors. Three different FIRs were registered against leaders of BJP, BJYM and NCP. Later in the afternoon, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis told the media that his party won’t relent. “Our agitation will continue across the state till home minister Deshmukh does not own up moral responsibility and steps down.” Offences were registered against Bawankule, Datke, Joshi and others in one of the three FIRs registered at Sitabuldi police station. In the other FIR, offences were registered against the BJYM members. In the third FIR, senior leaders of NCP, like city president Ahirkar, have been booked. In Yavatmal, the BJP workers gathered at Datta Chowk. MLA Madan Yerawar dubbed the Maha Vikas Aghadi as Maha Vasuli Aghadi and said that the allegations levelled against the HM has demoralised every citizen of Maharashtra. “If the HM fails to step down or the CM doesn't seek Deshmukh's resignation, we will continue our agitation,” he said. MLAs Dr Ashok Uikey, Namdevrao Sasane and Nilay Naik, district unit president Nitin Bhutada, general secretary Raju Padgilwar and others attended the protest meet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/show-of-strength-bjp-ncp-spar-over-anil-deshmukh/articleshow/81620917.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||Chargesheeting all political cases of last 6 months: CP||Nagpur: City police chief Amitesh Kumar sent a strong message on Sunday against all political misadventures and toying with the law by taking a decision of assimilating evidence and sending chargesheets of all cases of protests and agitations in the last six months for the court to take them up for trial on a priority basis. After effigy burning in front of the residence of home minister Anil Deshmukh near GPO Square in Civil lines on Sunday morning, the CP is set to request courts to take up political cases on board and issue summons or warrants as soon as possible. “In order to deter citizens from joining protests and agitations on the streets, we will now strive to take cases already registered to their logical conclusion,” said the top cop. Kumar also said there would be strict vigilance on political agitations and that intelligence machinery has been beefed up. “Political cases, which are getting registered, would be considered during passport and job inquiries too. Any political stunt will have long-term legal repercussions,” he said. From Monday onwards, Kumar will have the three-pronged responsibility of enforcing the fresh guidelines issued regarding the extended restrictions till March 31 to break the corona chain, tackle the simmering tension between the BJP and NCP over state home minister Anil Deshmukh’s resignation and also internal concern about rising Covid cases among cops. On Sunday, a 49-year-old constable of Pachpaoli police station died of Covid. “The enforcements would continue from 4pm till 6am. Police squads would be activated from 4pm onwards. Two persons would not be allowed on bikes and three in cars unless there’s an emergency situation,” he said. On Sunday, 48 people were penalized for not wearing masks and 287 for violating social distancing normns. Over Rs 40,000 was recovered in fines. Five private establishments too were checked. “Offices shall be checked, crowding would not be allowed and no gathering of any kind would be permitted,” said the top cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/chargesheeting-all-political-cases-of-last-6-months-cp/articleshow/81620946.cms||Soumitra Bose

The police had seized some weapons from the place apart from destroying machines which were used for manufacturing firearms. Meanwhile, the state government also made an annual budgetary allocation of Rs 10 crore for the welfare of surrendered Naxals and their families through the district planning commitee. The fund is learnt to be spent for various developmental activities revolving around surrendered Naxals, focusing on their rehabilitation and return to the mainstream of society. It is learnt that the success of the C-60 commandos to raid the arms factory and reduce it to ashes was due to a former Naxal, who is now staying at the police camp. He had shown the personnel the route to the secret location. The Naxals were believed to be planning to prepare a crude grenade launcher at their arms factory to use it against the security forces. Jolted by the C-60 raid, a press statement by the Naxals from their western sub-zonal bureau has appealed to their surrendered comrades to refrain from helping cops. They have also asked villagers to ensure that the surrendered Naxals return to the villages, reunite with their families and are also made a part of the gram sabhas. DIG, Naxal range, Sandip Patil, said the choice of living and leading their own lives should be left to the surrendered Naxals. “The surrendered Naxals are like any other citizens who should be allowed to take their own decisions,’ he said. “Many former Naxals live with their kin in villages while some opt for the city for their own reasons. Many work as home guards under special schemes while others follow a profession of their choice,” said the DIG. “Naxals have been unnerved by the success of the police. They are blaming surrendered Naxals for their own failures. We appeal to all Naxals to surrender and opt for rehabilitation schemes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/surrendered-naxal-helped-cops-to-locate-and-bust-arms-factory/articleshow/81621007.cms||Soumitra Bose

According to academics, some colleges didn't appoint contributory teachers in the academic session 2020-21, citing the Covid-19 pandemic. Quoting an example of a government-run college, they said that for a couple of subjects, it failed to appoint a contributory teacher after the previous one superannuated last year. “No online classes were being held for these subjects since July-August when academic sessions began, yet the college administration got exam forms filled by the students. The NU administration isn’t monitoring this important aspect either. If not even a single class has been held, how are the students asked to appear in the examinations? Is it allowed as per existing rules?” they said. They added that if students were allowed to appear in NU exams on the basis of self-study in absence of teachers, the rule of mandatory appointment of teachers should be relaxed. Endorsing them, NU statutory members said this situation was rampant in lesser-known private colleges, particularly in the rural areas or those located outside the city limits. “In absence of proper monitoring, these erring colleges not only manipulate teachers’ appointments, but also attendance of the students, they said. The members added, “A majority of NU colleges run courses on the basis of contributory teachers and did not bother to appoint a regular lecturer approved by NU. Since all classes were held online last year due to Covid-19 pandemic, many of them did not bother to appoint lecturers to avoid paying them salary.” NU’s board of examination and evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable could not be contacted for comments on academics' allegations. Senior NU officials said they will inquire into it and take action against the erring colleges if they failed to appoint the contributory teachers. Over 2.60L students to appear in NU exams Speaking to TOI on Friday, the BOEE director said over 2.60 lakh students would appear for NU exams commencing from March 25. Of them, 2.30 lakh are undergraduate and 32,000 are postgraduate students. “Unlike summer 2020, the students wouldn’t get any choice, as they have to compulsorily solve all 40 multiple choice questions (MCQs) of two marks each in one hour. Last time their syllabus wasn’t completed but now, all colleges have completed it through online teaching,” he said. He clarified that the colleges were entrusted to conduct postgraduate exams along with those of external students. “Even for those UG courses where the number of students is below 100, their respective colleges would hold their papers and submit the marks to NU. We will be keeping copies of their question papers with us and regularly monitor their exams,” Sable said.

He said the director for municipal administration must apply a scientific methodology while reserving municipal wards. Kamat has said that any deviation from a fair reservation policy will once again lead to another legal battle. “The Supreme Court verdict on municipal reservations is loud and clear. The directorate of municipal administration and State Election Commission must act with complete neutrality and independence,” Kamat said. SEC Chokha Ram Garg resigned from the post on Saturday after the Supreme Court’s verdict on Friday. Congress said that despite strong objections and warnings from the opposition, the government had adamantly tried to bulldoze the democratic process and gone ahead with the reservations of wards in various municipal areas in order to benefit BJP. “The BJP government deprived the OBC, SC, ST and women of their constitutional right of contesting elections in the local self-help bodies from reserved wards. Ultimately, justice prevailed and the BJP government fell flat on its face for all its misdeeds,” he said. The order of the SC has made it very clear that the SEC needs to be neutral, unbiased and independent, Kamat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/for-reservation-follow-scientific-policy-kamat-tells-municipal-admin/articleshow/81500806.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Thousands of demonstrators had converged on the city centre, ignoring COVID-19 restrictions, to protest against a government bill going through parliament that would give police new powers to restrict street protests.  The local force, Avon and Somerset Police, said the demonstration began peacefully but was later turned into a violent disorder by a small minority.  Home Secretary Priti Patel, the interior minister, said on Twitter that the scenes in Bristol were unacceptable.  "Thuggery and disorder by a minority will never be tolerated," she said. "Our police officers put themselves in harm's way to protect us all. My thoughts this evening are with those police officers injured."  Two officers were taken to hospital, one with a broken arm and another with broken ribs, while others were subjected to violence and verbal abuse. The outside of a police station in the city centre was vandalized.  Avon and Somerset Police said it had requested help from neighbouring forces to bring the situation under control.  "All those involved in this criminal behaviour will be identified and brought to justice. There will be significant consequences for behaviour such as this," Avon and Somerset's chief superintendent, Will White, said in a statement.  A Reuters photographer at the scene saw some demonstrators launch fireworks towards police officers, try to knock over a police van, scale the outside wall of a police station and spray graffiti on it.  He also saw police, some in full riot gear, using batons and shields to try to repel protesters.  Some demonstrators carried placards with slogans such as "Kill the Bill", "The Day Democracy Became Dictatorship" and "We Can't Be Silenced That Easy".  The government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts bill would give police new powers to impose time and noise limits on street protests.  That has angered activists, particularly since a heavy-handed police response to a London vigil for murder victim Sarah Everard on March 13 caused widespread outrage and criticism of the police.  A serving police officer has been charged with Everard's kidnap and murder, and the case has unleashed an outpouring of grief and rage over the issue of violence against women and girls.  The government bill pre-dated the Everard case and covers a wide range of policy areas as well as the policing of protests. However, the two became connected in many people's minds because, by coincidence, the bill was up for debate in parliament two days after the London vigil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/police-officers-hurt-vehicles-set-on-fire-in-violent-protest-in-bristol-england/articleshow/81623631.cms||---

Police on Sunday had blocked the road in front of the residence of state home minister Anil Deshmukh. The city police were left red-faced after Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) burnt an effigy of Deshmukh in front of his residence. This happened in the backdrop of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s charges against Deshmukh. Top police officers don’t want to take chances owing to the political flare-up over the issue. Senior inspector Atul Sabnis of Sitabuldi police station said additional security was deployed at the residence of Fadnavis as they cannot rule out demonstration in front of the former CM’s house. “Police department has suo moto decided to increase the security,” he said.

A student returned from France to One-Town in Vijayawada and tested positive for the virus. And thus, began a long and arduous struggle with the dreaded coronavirus that led to a year full of lockdowns and many inconveniences. The Krishna district administration was on its toes. As soon as the first case was reported, the administration began ramping up medical infrastructure. Some of its initiatives found appreciation nationally as well as globally. Krishna was the first district to shift vegetable markets to open spaces. City buses turned vegetable markets during the lockdown. Women self-help groups were empowered to door-deliver essential commodities through MEPMA marts maintained by the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC). “Covid-19 is a very tough time for us. We have explored all ways to protect the people. The city was the first to establish shelters for the homeless and migrant workers,” said VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh. Krishna district collector A Md Imtiaz said, “We are focussing on the vaccination drive. While continuing vaccination for frontline warriors, we have focussed on senior citizens and people above 45 years of age. Altogether, 1.2 lakh people from the city have been vaccinated till date.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/on-march-21-krishna-completes-one-year-of-struggle-with-covid/articleshow/81619737.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Goa||Too good for the rest||The organisers simply didn’t know what to say. Deepa Mahambre was such a dominating figure in Goan table tennis that she won most, if not all, of the 16 tournaments that were being organised in a season, typically running from June to January. In many tournaments, Deepa didn’t even drop a game. Whenever there was little resistance from the other end, she simply changed gears and floored her rival. Winning trophies was becoming monotonous. It was no longer exciting, so one fine evening Deepa walked up to the organisers and requested them to allow her to compete in the men’s category. Not surprisingly, her request was turned down. After all, a defeat for any of the men would have been difficult to digest. “In Goa, there was not much competition, so I made the request to play with men. It would have provided me with valuable experience of competing with better players,” says Deepa. Table tennis in the seventies was among the bigger attractions in Goa and Mapusa-born Deepa was the magnet that drew several to venues across the state. While Elma da Cunha, Asha Dhubashi, Susan de Sousa and Vanitha Bakhle were the other stars of that era, once Deepa moved to the top in 1975, there was no stopping her. “It helped that I had a sporting family. My (five) brothers all played football for top clubs in Goa. I was the youngest and watched my brothers bring trophies at home. I wanted to do the same,” says Deepa. She found the perfect guru in Ashok, her brother, and Goa’s first home-grown table tennis coach. Every morning, Deepa trained under the watchful eyes of her brother, till it was time to either go to school and later college at St Xaviers. Once studies were done with, it was back to table tennis till dusk. With so much of training – six hours minimum every day – and hunger to succeed, Deepa was soon unbeatable in Goa. She even grabbed attention at the national level, famously defeating international paddler Veenu Bhushan at the National table tennis championship in Allahabad in 1977. Bhushan was a huge star. A bronze medallist at the Asian Championships in 1974, everyone was rooting for the local favourite from Uttar Pradesh. Deepa, though, had ideas of her own and stunned the national champion. “After the victory, the coach (Ranbir) Bhandari came up to me and asked if I was related to Ashok. I said he’s my brother, and he responded, ‘no wonder you are playing his game’, remembers Deepa. Bhandari was the coach in-charge of the department of table tennis at the Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports, Patiala, from where Ashok got his coaching degree. The Allahabad defeat of Bhushan was not a flash in the pan. A couple of years later when the nationals were being played in Indore, Deepa registered another upset. This time, she had the prized scalp of international star Monalisa Barua. According to one newspaper account, “Deepa attacked freely on both flanks while a somewhat surprised Monalisa — finalist at the previous national championship — was unable to get going and played well below par.” Deepa, known for her attacking game, won 27-25, 13-21, 21-19. “Table tennis was played without much support in Goa. The organisers couldn’t invite outstation players, so we ended up playing amongst ourselves. I fondly remember the contribution of Mr (Jaisngh) Maganlal; he promoted the game, arranged transport for us and also a buffet, which we could have never afforded. “It helped me that I moved to Bombay in 1981, looking for competition. I improved quite a lot, but it was already too late to make further progress. My style had already developed,” says Deepa, who was employed with Customs. Mumbai was a different world with plenty of players giving her a taste of what competitive table tennis is all about. She rubbed shoulders with champions, and although her game improved tremendously, it was too late to break into the Indian team. “If only I had come to Bombay earlier,” she says. Mumbai is now her home. It is here that she fell in love with Suhas Awchat, married him in 1985 and is now the owner of the famous Goa Portuguesa restaurant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/too-good-for-the-rest/articleshow/81621346.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

With cumulative energy savings in industry reaching 0.25 million tonnes of oil equivalent, that is 2,904 million units (tentative), Andhra Pradesh has done quite well in cycle-II of the PAT scheme. There has been significant improvement from 0.21 million tonnes of oil equivalent, that is 2,384 MU, in cycle-I of the scheme. Further, Andhra Pradesh achieved 0.89 million tonnes carbon dioxide reduction in PAT cycle-II, thereby registering a marked improvement from 0.73 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent in the first edition of the scheme. The energy efficiency measures have been implemented in 22 energy-intensive units in Andhra Pradesh including cement, fertiliser, pulp, paper, power generation and chemicals. These measures coupled with IoT-enabled efficiency measures helped the state save 238 crore units of electricity worth Rs 1,600 crore. Energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said that the state government is very keen on promoting cost-effective and quality power to help improve the potential of industrial development and for overall economic development of the state. “The PAT scheme will help meet the objectives of the government,” Srikant said. The energy department will also make efforts to adapt the energy-efficient technologies in the 98,000 MSMEs in the state. The government is also planning a state-level conference to improve energy efficiency measures in industries under the PAT scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/state-sets-up-spl-pat-cell-to-make-industries-more-energy-efficient/articleshow/81619760.cms||---

The turtles lay eggs along the Andhra Pradesh coast in December and after. Conservatories like the forest department collect the eggs, store them in a protected location for artificial hatching and release the baby turtles after a gap of 40–45 days. The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) is providing financial support for the exercise. The process of releasing Olive Ridley hatchlings started in the third week of March and will continue till May, said Ch Ranga Rao, assistant manager, corporate social responsibility (CSR) of NTPC-Simhadri. Nearly 300 hatchlings have crawled back to their natural habitat from Mutyalammapalem beach in Parwada. “We have tied up with the forest department to conserve endangered sea turtles along north-coastal Andhra with Rs 14 lakh in 2021,” Ranga Rao told TOI.

---||Nagpur||Fadnavis fires fresh queries at Deshmukh, HM clarifies||Nagpur: After NCP supremo Sharad Pawar granted clean chit to home minister Anil Deshmukh, leader of opposition Devendra Fadanvis questioned the minister over former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s ‘letter bomb’. Coming to Deshmukh’s rescue, Pawar on Monday claimed that the home minister was in isolation in February due to Covid-19 infection and, therefore, didn’t meet anyone as alleged by Singh in his eight-page letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Fadanvis however, questioned how the minister had convened a press conference in Nagpur outside Alexis Hospital in presence of his security guards after getting discharge. “It seems Pawar wasn’t briefed properly on Singh’s letter. The SMS evidence given by the former Mumbai police commissioner shows that (Deshmukh’s) meeting date (with suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, now in NIA’s custody) was mentioned as end of February. Now, who’s diverting the issue?” said Fadnavis. Responding to the charges, Deshmukh then released videos in Hindi and Marathi clarifying his stand. “I was admitted to the hospital from February 5 to 15 after testing positive for coronavirus. When I was discharged and was going home, many media men were waiting with their cameras outside. They wanted to talk to me on various issues,” he said. Deshmukh added that as he was having weakness due to Covid-19 infection, he preferred to sit on a chair kept at the lawns on the hospital’s premises. “After answering their queries, I went on home isolation till February 27. I moved out only on February 28 for a meeting at Sahyadri,” the minister said. Meanwhile, after beefing up security outside Deshmukh’s house, the city police on Monday deployed additional security with barricades in front of Fadnavis’s residence at Dharampeth apprehending protests from various groups. Singh has moved the Supreme Court demanding a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) against Deshmukh. In his letter, the former Mumbai top cop had labelled serious allegations against Deshmukh that included asking Vaze to collect Rs 100 crore every month from about 1,750 bars and restaurants in the state capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fadnavis-fires-fresh-queries-at-deshmukh-hm-clarifies/articleshow/81635585.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Kolkata||GJM (Tamang) announces candidates for 3 Hills seats||Darjeeling/Kalimpong: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha faction led by Binoy Tamang and Anit Thapa on Sunday announced the candidates for the three Hills seats in the upcoming assembly elections. Tamang also released the election manifesto in Mungpo, 40km from Darjeeling. The candidates will file their nomination papers on March 24. The Gurung faction will announce the names of their candidates on Tuesday. So far, only CPM and All India Gorkha League (Bharati Tamang faction) have announced their candidate list. BJP and its allies — GNLF, CPRM, AIGL (Pratap Khati faction), Sumeti Mukti Morcha and Gorkhaland Rashtriya Nirman Morcha — are still in disagreements over their nominees. Before announcing the names, Tamang asked the crowd at the Mungpo school ground to prioritise the party and not the faces. “Many may not approve of the candidates, but it is important to look at the party first. I will make the candidates work for the people,” he said. The Tamang and Bimal Gurung factions are supporting Trinamool Congress in the election. However, both have refused to arrive at a common platform. “We will contest in our own capability. We must save regional politics and issues. If they (Gurung faction) extend support then it’s good, otherwise we have nothing to say,” Tamang said. Tshering Dahal (56), Nari Morcha president and central committee member of the party, will be contesting from Kurseong. Dahal was with Gorkha National Liberation Front party before joining the Tamang faction just before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Headmistress of Sukna high school, she was also a former panchayat pradhan. “People of the Hills should live in peace and should have employment to survive. We will work relentlessly. The win is foreseen.’ Dahal said. The party nominated Keshavraj Pokhrel (35) for Darjeeling constituency. Hailing from Relling under Bijanbari block of Darjeeling district, Pokhrel, also a school teacher, is currently the party spokesperson. In undivided GJM, Pokhrel worked his way up the party ranks and was president of the Vidhyarti Morcha. “I am confident about the win... People’s love and support are all that I need at the moment” he said. Ruden Sada Lepcha (51), a central committee member, will contest from Kalimpong. Lepcha is primarily a businessman but joined the Tamang faction in 2017 after the 104-day statehood agitation. “People have a massive expectation from us and I have taken it as a challenge to fulfil them. I have prepared myself well for this challenge,” Lepcha said. The party’s election manifesto has 52 issues, all of which relate to the state government. “We won’t make false promises, unlike others. We will work based on ground realities. Only issues that can be achieved via the state government have been included,” Tamang said. “We demand the government of India to reconsider the Indo-Bhutan peace and friendship treaty of 1949 and to repeal the India- Nepal Peace and Friendship Treaty-1950,” Tamang said, while reading the manifesto. Among the prominent issues are land rights, upgrading of the existing subdivisions of the hills, corporation status to the Darjeeling municipality, bifurcation of the existing eight blocks to fifteen for better administration, implementing a two tier panchayat system, establishing a separate medical College in the GTA jurisdiction and early launch of the pre-announced Darjeeling Hills University by chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Thapa said: “We will never seek votes by misusing the name of ‘Gorkhaland’ or make any false promises. The leaders remember Gorkhaland each time an election approaches — I will never bring the agenda of Gorkhaland to garner votes.” He later added that the prime agenda for this election was land rights and employment generation. He appealed to his supporters to be transparent and ask for votes without giving false hope and assurances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/gjm-tamang-announces-candidates-for-3-hills-seats/articleshow/81622285.cms||Deep Gazmer

---||Kolkata||11,000 West Bengal police personnel to help 684 companies of central forces in first phase||KOLKATA: The Election Commission has decided to deploy 11,415 state police personnel in addition to 684 companies of central forces for the first phase of polling in West Bengal on March 27. Only central forces will be present inside polling booths while state and central forces will cordon off booths from outside. District police superintendents have been asked to complete the police deployment process by 7pm on March 23. Earlier, it was planned to have only central forces within a radius of 100m from a booth but it has now been decided to have only central forces within booths. Trinamool Congress had opposed the move. Even for maintaining queues, state police would help central forces. In a note to ADG (law and order) Jag Mohan, chief electoral officer Ariz Aftab had written on Friday that central forces should not be deployed on any static duty unless it was part of deployment strategy. The CEO wrote that out of nine sections of the company of a central force, eight sections were to be used in guarding poll booths while the rest were to be used for QRT (Quick Response Team). Aftab also asked for special attention in LWE areas and for policing arrangements to be made in consultation with the police observers. He wanted one platoon of central force to guard EVMs. One platoon of striking force would be with the SP and SDPO. In his note to SPs of five poll-bound districts, Jag Mohan has asked for deployment of policemen keeping in mind that none should be posted in the home district and for randomisation to be done before deployment. He also sought a nodal officer for each district. Purulia will have maximum central forces at 185 companies, followed by Jhargram at 144, East Midnapore 148, West Midnapore 124 and Bankura 83. For tackling Maoists as well as troublemakers, both central forces as well as state police will coordinate around booths and in quick response teams. QRTs will have a commander from the central force and an SI or ASI of state police. The SI or ASI is to help QRT as state police have a better understanding of ground-level situation and are aware of the locality and local language. QRTs would be trained to speedily reach trouble-prone zones with the help of GPS tracking. Central forces would be deployed depending on vulnerability of the area, for which the number of policemen in a poll booth can be four and go up to 10 per booth in LWE areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/11k-state-police-personnel-to-help-684-cos-of-central-forces-in-first-phase/articleshow/81622199.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal assembly elections: Adhikari patriarch Sisir formally joins BJP in Amit Shah’s presence at Egra rally||KOLKATA/EGRA: Sisir Adhikari, the octogenarian patriarch of the Adhikari family in East Midnapore, on Sunday joined BJP in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah in Egra, ending months of speculation after his sons Suvendu and Soumendu defected to the saffron party three months back. Sisir, the 80-year-old three-time Contai MP who is also a former Union minister of state, claimed “history will remember the way in which my family was driven out of Trinamool Congress” but added “I will not resign from Trinamool, let them do whatever they want”. Adhikari senior, who has recently been speaking out for eldest son Suvendu, said: “I was with Trinamool Congress for long. The way they tortured our family is unprecedented. I never experienced such a pain in my six-decade-old political career. I do not want to get into those details now. Today, I am not feeling sad at all.” “I will fight a new battle. India is marching ahead under Narendra Modi. Egra has a long history. In 1952, a BJP candidate won from Egra,” he added. “Suvendu,” the father later told reporters, “will win the election by a huge margin. TMC will be wiped out in East Midnapore.” On the resignation issue, Sisir said: “They (TMC) have not kept any contact with me. I am not bothered about them.” Trinamool has not so far formally removed Sisir as the party’s district chairperson. Sisir’s third son — Trinamool’s Tamluk MP Dibyendu Adhikari — has not severed his ties with the party. The crowd started pouring in from early morning at Egra’s Pallighai school ground. BJP workers and supporters from nearby Ramnagar, Contai, Balighai and Patashpur came in buses and matadors. After Shah took the dais, Adhikari senior greeted him with folded hands. The Union minister greeted him back amid cheering by the crowd. After Shah finished his speech, he stepped forward to greet the crowd and asked Sisir and BJP’s Bengal in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya to join him. Sisir too chanted “Jai Shri Ram” and “Bharat Mata ki Jai”. Suvendu was not present at the Egra rally as he was campaigning in Nandigram, where he is pitted against chief minister Mamata Banerjee. In his speech, Shah said: “Mamata Didi doesn’t mind if you have to pay Rs 500 for tolabaji (extortion). If we are voted to office, you don’t even have to pay a penny to get work done. They did not allow you to vote during panchayat polls. Nowhere in India has such a thing happened. We have promised that each farmer will get their due amount under Krishak Samman Nidhi programme. We have also rolled out schemes for fishermen. We will bring Mahishya samaj under OBC category.” Adhikari senior said: “I know how beneficial it can be when we have the same government at the Centre and the state. I was a minister at the Centre and I know about it.” “We had plans for a deep sea port (in Tajpur) in 2010. Nothing happened in the past 10 years. Now the state government is talking about that again, knowing full well that a state cannot do it without the Centre’s help,” he added. “I would request Amit Shah-ji to create job opportunities for the youth after BJP takes office,” Sisir continued. “If you are working for the state, our entire family will support you.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/adhikari-patriarch-sisir-formally-joins-bjp-in-shahs-presence-at-egra-rally/articleshow/81622115.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Vadodara||Worms in semolina: One yr jail for manufacturers||Vadodara: Four partners of a food factory were sentenced to imprisonment as semolina (rava) manufactured by them contained pests. The court of additional chief judicial magistrate S B Shah also ordered to register a case against the material witness Rahul Barot, who turned hostile to favour the four persons facing charges. As per the details of the case, a senior government food inspector had collected samples of semolina and fortified flour from Shreeji Food Products factory at Sayajipura in November 2006, suspecting adulteration.  During the analysis of the semolina’s samples at Rajkot and Central Food Laboratory at Mysuru, the analysts had found 22 alive and 16 dead caterpillars in it. A case was registered against the company and its four partners Pravin Lukka, Bharat Lukka, Jitendra Lukka and Mukesh Lukka. During the hearing, the accused had alleged that the food inspector had not collected the samples properly and the spoon and case used by him for collecting and storing the samples were not clean. “The material witness turned hostile and did not support our case. However, along with the material witness’s signature there was also the signature of one of the accused on the panchnama and they could not produce any evidence to support their claims,” said additional public prosecutor Pranav Joshi. The court upheld the evidence of test reports of the samples submitted by Joshi and came down heavily on Barot. “Despite being an accountant, he kept aside his moral values and turned hostile while being on oath,” the court stated in the judgement. A notice has been ordered to be issued to Barot over why he should not be punished and fined. The four partners of the factory were sentenced to one year of imprisonment and were fined Rs 5,000 each. The firm was also ordered to pay a fine of Rs 5,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/worms-in-semolina-one-yr-jail-for-manufacturers/articleshow/81620110.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Modi is now leading Mir Jafars, a gang of thieves: CM||Contai (East Midnapore): Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday hit out at the BJP and PM Narendra Modi, saying the party was one of “traitors and robbers”, reminding them that Bengal had “never forgiven Mir Jafars”. She was speaking on the home turf of TMC-turned-BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari and his father Sisir, who formally joined the saffron camp on Sunday. Hitting out at the PM’s “TMC thieves” barb, Banerjee said: “TMC chor (thief)? Narendra Modi, tomar gaddar-ra chorer baba (the traitors with you are the father of thieves).... BJP is now a party of robbers.... People never forgive traitors. Bengal has not forgiven Mir Jafars.” The CM rued that she had trusted the “traitors” in her party, possibly alluding to the Adhikaris, but never mentioning them by name. “Ami boro gadha (I have been a fool). I had blind faith in them. I had given them my love and affection.... In my affection, I couldn’t see the treachery beyond their masks,” Banerjee said. “The traitors have made a lot of money. I could not understand this hidden talent of theirs. They have made so much money that now, they have fled to save it. Else, I would have thrown them out. They are now having thousands of crores. We will probe the Rs 5,000-crore complaint issue in Contai Co-operative Bank,” she said, asking people to question “which people had taken what for teacher recruitments done locally”. “What is worse is their own admission that they had been in touch with the BJP since 2014,” the CM said, adding, “I had to take permission to come to East Midnapore. They behaved as if it was a fiefdom, as if it was a Centre-governed territory. But now I can come at my will. I have rented a place in Nandigram and plan to set up a small home on the banks of the Haldi river.” “Whatever development work has been done here in the past decade was done by me and my government and the traitors took undue credit. I had appointed him as a minister and therefore the plaques have their name. They made a bagful of cash and now have gone to BJP. These Vibhishans are more dangerous.” Banerjee said Midnapore had to be “freed from their clutches”. Questioning the role of the Adhikaris in the Nandigram agitation, she asked, “Where were they then? I had come in ailing health, and they were cooing their heels at home, although I kept calling them. Cast your vote against these traitors. The BJP is now a party of robbers.” The CM also took potshots at PM Modi, saying, “The Prime Minister should first explain about PM-Care, demonetisation and the 15-lakh-in-bank-accounts promises. He should return people’s money first.” Banerjee also repeatedly told party workers in all her three public meetings — in Contai South, Contai North and Nandakumar in East Midnapore — to keep a month-long vigil on ballot boxes. “The Central and state police will do their job, but it is your job to ensure people’s votes are guarded. Do not eat anything offered by outsiders. If EVMs stop functioning, do not return home; wait till voting resumes. In case of technical glitches, check that the machine is switched on and off twice, or more, before voting begins. Do not let any unauthorised outsiders set up camps in villages and localities. They will try to loot votes,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/modi-is-now-leading-mir-jafars-a-gang-of-thieves-cm/articleshow/81622407.cms||Suman Mandal
---||Kolkata||Docs, new parents remember ‘miracle births’ of Kolkata’s lockdown babies||Kolkata: Krishika, Abhivav, Abhineeth, Shankhadyuti… They haven’t got much in common, except for the situation they were born in. You know of “millennium babies’’; two decades later, you have “lockdown babies”, who came into this world in the initial stages of the Covid-induced curfew. “Every child born in those circumstances was a miracle,” recalls Gautam Khastagir, a senior gynaecologist and fertility expert. “When they grow up, these kids will understand how historic their births were, because of the trouble their mothers took and all that effort on the part of their doctors,” he said. The virus was new, and so, the circumstances and logistics were mostly unknown for pre-gnant women. Most doctors agreed that doing emergency C-sections in near-empty labour wards was unnerving. Moushumi Sen, 31, who gave birth to Krishika on March 22, 2020, said: “It was surreal; there was no one on the streets, no cabs even. Finally, a driver took us to hospital. But the thought of being in close proximity with a number of people was scary.” It’s no wonder, then, that Sen’s consultant gynaecologist, Chandrima Dasgupta, has been doubling up as a psychologist. “We needed to calm frayed nerves. But with children and eldery parents at home, I was in a bad shape myself, thinking I’d bring back the virus. The biggest challenge was working with the fear,” she said. The doctors would sweat it out — literally — under layers of protective gear. “I carried an oxygen cylinder fitted with cannula during the C-sections,” Dr Chandrima Dasgupta said. For new mothers, even basics were hard to get. “No shops were open for us to buy clothes for my newborn sons. It felt overwhelming,” said Sudeshna De, who delivered twins Abhivav and Abhineeth on March 26 last year with the help of Khastagir, who was instrumental in the birth of around 60 babies since the lockdown began. The plight of expecting women was no less. From March 22, at least for the next six months, Covid rules meant no physical consultations or scans. Tina Bhattacharya, 35, an HR executive, revisited her experience of isolation and the medical and emotional support she received from her consultant gynaecologist, Queene Aditya. “In normal times, it would be much simpler hopping on a cab to see my doctor. But I could only have virtual consultancies. In hospital, everyone was in full PPE. I couldn’t see any face, only heard Dr Aditya’s reassuring voice. I wanted to relax and enjoy my baby. But the anxiety was too much,” she said. “It was challenging for every one,” agreed Dr Aditya, adding, “Midway through a Caesarian, I often ask an OT attendant to remove my face shield because I am totally blinded due to fogging of vision.” Covid RT-PCR tests were available only from May 2020. “Only if the patient was Covid-negative, could she be admitted in the Covid-negative ward. But this wasn’t possible in March and April,” Dr Aditya said. Normal delivery was tough because the women landed up at unexpected hours, with Covid-unknown status, she added. “We took personal protection, assured patients that the PPE was a bilateral protection,” Dr Khastagir explained. “If things were sterilized thoroughly, chances of infection became near-zero. This is a norm now. As a consequence, we have had very high hygiene standards. For instance, disposable gowns, which I saw in the UK, are now mandatory here. We also dealt with high-risk pregnancies. But we have emerged enriched in this pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docs-new-parents-remember-miracle-births-of-kolkatas-lockdown-babies/articleshow/81622415.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||New panels to oversee civic body-run Cov programmes||Kolkata: The Bengal government is likely to appoint fresh committees to oversee civic body-run Covid management programmes throughout the state, including Kolkata and Bidhannagar. This comes after the Election Commission (EC) ordered the removal of administrators or members of board of administrators (BoA) in all civic bodies who are political appointees to maintain the model code of conduct. The EC, in a second note to the chief secretary on Saturday evening, had mentioned about five civic bodies — Kolkata, Bidhannagar, Chandernagore, Asansol and Siliguri — which are run by BoA, who are all political appointees. The poll panel mentioned the candidates —Firhad Hakim, Atin Ghosh and Debashis Kumar of KMC, Tapas Chatterjee of Bidhannagar and Ashok Bhattacharya and Shankar Ghosh of Siliguri. While the EC sought a compliance report from the state government by 10am on Monday, it has instructed a committee led by the chief secretary to appoint government officials to discharge the functions of the administrators. “We have a deadline till 10am on Monday to come to any decision on this issue,” chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay told TOI. Sources said a decision was yet to be reached on whether the respective municipal commissioners of the civic bodies would take charge from Monday. “The committee can consist of bureaucrats, retired government officials or even any non-political person,” said a senior government official. In Bengal, the board of administrators were formed in around 100 civic bodies following the postponement of civic elections amid the Covid-19 pandemic. In Kolkata and Salt Lake, the BoA had been looking after operations from May 8 last year . There has been a rise in Covid cases in the city and Bidhannagar. After hovering in the 90s for around a week, the city crossed the century-mark in terms of new infections on Saturday. On Sunday, it clocked 158 new infections. Bidhannagar, too, has reported 16 to 17 cases daily. “With those in the BoA who are not contesting in elections also having to move out, day-to-day civic services may get hampered,” said Atin, previously the KMC’s MMIC (health). Krishna Chakraborty, previously the mayor of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation, said: “People will continue to get normal civic amenities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-panels-to-oversee-civic-body-run-cov-programmes/articleshow/81622416.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||West Bengal assembly polls: Assam Citizenship (Amendment) Act put Bengalis and Hindus in jail, says TMC||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Sunday said the BJP’s Bengal poll manifesto suggesting that the state assembly will ratify the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was “misleading” because a state had no role in implementing a central act. “We also wish to point out that in Assam, while trying to implement this, they had put 17 lakh people, including Bengali-speaking Hindus, in detention camps,” said party MP Saugata Roy in TMC’s first formal reactions to the just-released manifesto. “The cash benefits promised are all jumla. This Bechu Babu sarkar (a person who sells everything) is copying Trinamool schemes. They have promised Annapurna canteens to provide food for Rs 5, we are running Ma canteens. They have promised to set up a trust for Brahmins, we are already giving them monthly help,” Roy said. “When they talk of fresh cash benefit schemes, we just want to remind people about their 2014 poll promise of sending Rs 15 lakh to everyone’s bank account,” he added. The TMC MP also questioned why a Bengal poll manifesto had to be read out in Hindi by a person from Gujarat in a central government institution. “Isn’t it a manifesto for Bengal? Aren’t there enough leaders from Bengal? And why is a political programme being done at EZCC, a central government institution?” he asked. “In contrast, Mamata Banerjee had read out TMC’s poll manifesto from her Kalighat home,” Roy said. “We also heard about several promises being made for women. If they had been so keen on this, why haven't such schemes been implemented in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and even Karnataka? We would also like to ask why crimes against women are so high in BJP-governed states. Why is Hathras and Unnao happening?” the MP asked. The Bengal government was implementing schemes that have been lauded by the UN, he said. “In addition, for several state schemes — including Swasthya Sathi — the biometric card is issued to women. In addition, Mamata Banerjee has also announced a scheme to directly help all women financially. She has already done what she has promised,” he said. “We have seen they are speaking of stopping illegal infiltration and fencing of international borders. We have been hearing this for the past seven years. International borders are manned by BSF, a central force. Is it an admission that they have not done what they are supposed to do in the first place?” Roy said. “The manifesto is full of tall promises. They know they do not have to implement it for they will never come to office in Bengal. They are talking of implementing Ayushman Bharat in Bengal. Till date, it has been extended to only 1 crore people in India. Here, Swasthya Sathi is for all 10 crore people in Bengal. They talk of generating employment. See the economic disaster they have created. Mamata Banerjee has promised job opportunities in specific focus areas, in addition to bringing down the unemployment rate by half. When unemployment rates in India rose, in Bengal it had fallen,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-assam-caa-put-bengalis-hindus-in-jail/articleshow/81622187.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Narendra Modi coins new slogan: Didi jachchhe||BANKURA: “Didi jachchhe, ashol poriborton ashchhe (Didi is on her way out, real change is coming)”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in Bankura on Sunday, pulling no punches at the ruling Trinamool, adding he wouldn’t let chief minister Mamata Banerjee “kick away Bengal’s dreams”. In the scorching heat of Bankura’s Tilabedia Maidan, ahead of the first phase of the assembly elections on March 27, Modi turned up the poll rhetoric, projecting himself as the harbinger of change and alleging he was being ridiculed by Banerjee’s men. “They (the Trinamool) are drawing pictures showing Didi’s foot on my head. Didi can kick my head if she wants, but I won’t let her kick away Bengal’s dreams,” he said. Modi asked the crowd to compare Banerjee’s “hollow promises” for the last 10 years with the “grim reality” — concluding the Trinamool regime had given birth to “tolabaj, syndicate and mafias”. He also coined a slogan to describe the situation: “The BJP runs on schemes, while TMC runs on scam”, adding this was why Banerjee had thrown a spanner in the works of Ayushman Bharat and PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. “They know that central schemes do not have room for cut money, so they are not interested,” the PM said, adding the state had deprived Bengal farmers Rs 14,000 each under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. “I can assure you that we will release the money plus the instalments for the future the day BJP assumes office in Bengal,” he said. The Prime Minister referred to the “pains” people have had to endure, allegedly because the state government had not done anything for them, while enriching themselves personally. “This land wants irrigation, piped drinking water. Youths want jobs that come through investments. What work have you done, Didi? The poor, the Adivasis, the backwards voted you for all this. Instead, Trinamool leaders got cars, built houses during all these days. From where did the money come? It’s your money. It is inbuilt in the cut money that you have to shell out to the sand mafia, pushing up costs when you build your own house,” punching it with his clarion call: “Khela sesh hobe, vikas arambha hobe (Didi’s game will come to an end, development will begin in Bengal).” Modi also laid special emphasis on first-time voters and women. “We have fielded old and new candidates who can help build a double-engine sarkar,” he said, adding, “I appeal to first-time voters to vote for the BJP. I won’t let your future go to waste like other parties did to the last three generations. Bengal couldn’t perform to the optimum. Young talents fled to other states. The coming 25 years is crucial for you, which is why you need a big push to make your dreams come true.” The PM also mentioned a volley of schemes the BJP government would take up the day it assumed office. “We will give access to piped drinking water to 1.5 crore people under the Jal-Jiban Mission; people will get free medical support under Ayushman Bharat; you will boost heritage tourism in Bishnupur, known for terracotta temples,” he said. “There is a huge demand for terracotta toys in the world market. The double-engine government will give a boost to toy-making.” “The symbol of your aspirations”, the PM said, was Chandana Bauri, the BJP’s candidate from the Saltora seat, who is among the poorest candidates in the fray. “This is the face tormented by the tolabajs. When BJP is voted to power, we will give respect to people — mayer puja hobe, manusher samman hobe (women and people in general will get respect).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/modi-coins-new-slogan-didi-jachchhe/articleshow/81622333.cms||Falguni Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Focus on women, caste blocs, refugees in BJP’s manifesto||Kolkata: The BJP manifesto for the Bengal polls, released in the city on Sunday by Union home minister Amit Shah, focuses on implementing CAA in the first cabinet meet, placing special focus on women empowerment and giving emphasis to backward sections and ethnic groups and castes. Called ‘Sankalp Patra’ — or a testament to the party’s resolve — the manifesto promises to regularise the citizenship of refugees immediately after assuming office. “Refugees have been living here since the 70s, and are pained at not having citizenship. We will implement CAA in the first cabinet meeting and provide citizenship to them,” Shah said. Stressing on a “zero tolerance to infiltration” policy, he said a special fund would be created for refugees, from which each family would be provided Rs 10,000 per year after they receive citizenship. A corpus of Rs 100 crore was announced for that. The document also contains a host of schemes for women and girls. Notable among them was a free education scheme, “termed from KG to PG”, and special bonds to SC, ST and OBC families for girls’ welfare. The party also proposed a 33% reservation for women in all government jobs. Regarding the “KG to PG” scheme, Shah said there will be a corpus of Rs 500 crore to provide financial assistance to meritorious girls. Apart from a special Rs 50,000 bond for families with a girl child, the manifesto also announced Rs one lakh to a woman from the SC, ST, OBC and economically weaker section at the time of her wedding. Also, the manifesto promises “free public transport” to women and girls in the state. The manifesto promises to bring Mahishya, Teli and other Hindu OBCs under the ambit of OBC reservation. Apart from establishing specific development boards for the nine Scheduled Tribe communities like Santhals, Oraons, Mundas and Bhumijs, the manifesto also included increased funding to Matua, Rajbangshi, Bauri and the Bagdi development boards. Shah announced a Rs 1,000-crore fund to incentivise weavers, carpenters and tanners. For ST-dominated blocks, Shah announced 200 days’ work under the MGNREGA scheme. The wage for the tea garden workers was proposed to be increased to Rs 350 from Rs 176 per day at present. On the healthcare front, the party proposed three new AIIMS: in north Bengal, Jangalmahal and the Sunderbans. A Rs 10,000-crore healthcare infrastructure fund was also proposed. The manifesto does not leave out arts and culture, something that has always strongly resonated in the Bengali mind. It promises a Tagore Prize “on the lines of the Nobel Prize”, and a Satyajit Ray Award, “on the lines of an Oscar”. If voted to office, the party also promises to keep aside Rs 500 crore for Kolkata to get the UNESCO Heritage City tag. “We will constitute a Sonar Bangla economic revival task force that will formulate new industrial policy to promote Bengal as investment destination and revive the sick industrial units,” Shah said. Assuring to bring Bengal among the top three states in terms of the ease of doing business, he said that Invest Bangla will be formed on the lines of centrally sponsored Invest India. While all dues of the state government towards the MSME units will be cleared, electricity will be provided at Rs 2 per unit for these units. A special corpus of Rs 500 crore was also proposed for collateral-free loans to the units. The manifesto also proposed free electricity — up to 200 units — for domestic consumption and a Rs 30,000-crore fund to be spent over five years to develop infrastructure in 10 cities. Rs 22,000 crore has been earmarked for transforming Kolkata into “a city of future”. “The figure might sound odd to you, but we have made a detailed estimate for that,” Shah said. Rs one lakh crore will be spent over five years for development of roads jointly with the centrally sponsored schemes. The BJP, which has been facing “outsider” barbs, on Sunday proposed Bengali and local languages as mandatory from classes 1 to 10 in schools, irrespective of their instruction medium. It also proposed to make Bengali one of the official languages at the United Nations. Shah also proposed Annapurna canteens, wgere meals would be provided at Rs 5 to all. The BJP, which is facing nationwide stir over the three farm laws and a “No Vote to BJP” campaign by farmers’ groups, wooed farmers through a host of schemes: Rs 4,000 per year was promised to landless farmers along with arrears, towards the centrally sponsored PM Kisan scheme. A Rs 20,000-crore corpus was proposed for agriculture infrastructure development and a Rs 5,000-crore corpus was proposed for the right price to farmers. It also proposed Rs 2,000 crore for infrastructure for fishermen and Rs 1,000 crore for development of dairy infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/focus-on-women-caste-blocs-refugees-in-bjps-manifesto/articleshow/81622275.cms||Rohit Khanna

This was the strictest ever lockdown — even petrol pumps were closed, milk parlours restricted and unlike previous lockdowns, few dared test the cops’ resolve to enforce it. Roads were barricaded, shops shut, hawkers weren’t around, and even milk parlours didn’t open in many localities in the three cities though the administration had allowed them to do business till 10am. Many medicine shops, too, remained closed though there was no restriction on them. The previous evening, people crowded markets as if they were stocking up for a return of the lockdown days, though CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan has repeatedly spoken against lockdown, saying Covid-19 must be beaten without affecting economic activities. “I am sure it’s a lockdown only for Sunday but you never know with the Covid numbers we are seeing. I am not taking any chances. In the beginning of the lockdown last year, we faced a lot of problems as it began for a ‘few days’ and then stretched on and on,” said Bhopal’s Dheeraj Pandey, who had bought a bagful of essentials. MP's daily Covid count hit the year's high of 1,322 on Sunday — averaging 942 cases in the past four days. In Indore, religious places remained closed too. Morning and evening walkers did not come out of their homes as the administration restricted entry to public gardens. In Jabalpur 1,435 people were fined for violating lockdown and 10 booked under section 188 IPC. In Bhopal, 185 cases were registered for lockdown violation, 1,260 people fined for not wearing masks and around Rs 1.32 lakh collected as spot fines. In Indore, however, violators were made to do squats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/lockdown-total-even-milk-medicine-shops-shut-despite-relaxation/articleshow/81623703.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||The Bengaluru women helping people reconnect with nature||BENGALURU: For weeks, veteran technologist Nalini Krishnan looked for a way to shake off the work-life blur and re-energise. She didn’t want to idle away the hours or stream shows; she wanted a meaningful experience in a setting that felt unfamiliar but welcoming. She found the remedy on a women-only trek near Bengaluru. After months of isolation and remote working, many stressed-out city dwellers, with varying fitness levels, are eager to hit the forest or hill trails. Initiatives like Happifeet, started by three women, are helping them reconnect with nature, appreciate the importance of this relationship and become more self-aware. Happifeet co-founders Maggie Inbamuthiah, Neha Mummigatti and Neeth D’Souza organise themed treks, including all-female trips, giving greater emphasis to wellness than physical feats. “All three of us love trekking, and we have trained in different therapy modalities. Spending time in nature is healing and empowering. A great mental-health booster. Japan, for instance, has the concept of forest bathing,” says Maggie, a serial entrepreneur and technologist. “We had been discussing how we could take the trekking experience to people who shy away by thinking one must be extremely fit to do it. We encourage everyone to feel the rock under their feet, feel the wind and see what that does to them. We also want people to rediscover positivity and be more sure of themselves.” Several women, from homemakers, IT professionals and entrepreneurs to business owners and avid hikers, signed up after learning that the activities, which included mindful exercises and meditation, were led by women. “Taking time away from family is always a challenge for women. Plus, many wonder if a particular activity will work for them or whether they know the people involved. In that context, it was wonderful to see their participation,” she says. “After the hike, they talked about feeling free and connected to themselves. It was great to see the transformation.” One of Happifeet’s objectives is to improve women’s access to the outdoors. “In society, there are so many spaces which are denied to women or where they are expected to stay in the background,” says Maggie, a leading advocate for inclusion and gender equity. The initiative also has an environmental dimension. “The more you enjoy nature, the more you respect it. You start paying attention to how you are using the resources. We are aiming in this direction,” she says. Nalini heads sourcing and competency management for Salesforce.com practice at TCS, and she has been associated with various support programmes for women in leadership and technology. “I had wanted to go on a trek for a long time, but there were always priorities. When I learned about the women-only trek, I instinctively said yes. I needed that break to stop running behind the clock, slow down and connect with nature, which replenishes your soul,” she says. Nalini, the mother of a 10-year-old, lives in a joint family. Before Covid-19, her day used to begin at 4 am with early preparations for the house and her school-going son, and end at 11 pm. Though WFH eased some pressure, in terms of the hours, it shut small windows of reprieve. “Earlier, I used to drive two hours to the office. That was the only ‘me’ time I got. During the pandemic, I realised how important that two-hour period was,” she says. Describing the challenges of WFH and the need to switch off, she adds: “The boundaries between personal and professional spheres have vanished. People walk by when I am on calls. Or when I am trying to focus on a task, kids come in. Things are always happening at home. In a way, the hike was my brief escape to recharge.” Suprriya Das is a storyteller, practising expressive arts therapy, a movement artist and an enthusiastic trekker. “For me, trekking is not about reaching a point. It’s about the walk. I take my own time, feeling every movement of my body. I feel truly present,” she says. She believes women must break out of the conditioning that they cannot pursue interests requiring physical effort. “We need to believe in our strength and not accept notions that we are delicate,” says Suprriya, who describes herself as a lifelong rebel. Neha, a psychotherapist, has been part of the development sector for more than a decade. A lot of her work has been related to preventing gender-based and sexual violence and promoting diversity and inclusion. “The idea of Happifeet is to help people get a sense of who they are and what they can do. Trekking is a physical activity that can translate into emotional wellness,” says Neha, who began trekking at the age of six. “Over the years, our lives have become fast-paced and we have moved away from nature, losing the sense of harmony with the environment. We hope to bring people closer to that side again.” Neha believes the pandemic has brought nature to the forefront and many people want to change their lifestyle. On the importance of creating spaces and communities for women, she says: “Women are the primary caregivers in most families. Often, their efforts are not recognised, so their sense of self takes a beating. They need communities where they can feel safe and connected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/the-bengaluru-women-helping-people-reconnect-with-nature/articleshow/81623742.cms||Harsh Vora

Some 1,039 — or 60% — of the new cases were from Bengaluru city. The active Covid cases in the state have increased from 12,432 on Saturday to 13,494 on Sunday. Bengaluru alone has 9,300 active cases. With more than 9,000 infections reported in the past week, Karnataka’s weekly tally of fresh Covid-19 cases crossed 5,000 for the first time in at least 10 weeks with the last three weeks consistently reporting a spike in weekly numbers. For first time in 2 months, number of cases in a week crosses 5,000With more than 9,000 infections reported over the past week, Karnataka’s weekly tally of fresh Covid-19 cases nearly doubled from the previous week. In fact, the number of cases crossed the 5,000 mark for the first time in at least 10 weeks with the last three weeks consistently reporting a spike in weekly numbers. In the 11 weeks between January 3 and March 20, six of the first seven weeks saw fewer cases than the previous weeks, while one week (February 7-13) saw a marginal increase of 1.9% before it dipped by 20% again the next week. But the last three weeks — February 28 to March 20 — reported a 22%, 35% and 85% jump, respectively. During this period, the state reported 47,359 fresh cases, of which more than 19% (9,149) was reported in the last week — March 14 and 20. The three weeks in March alone account for 37.5% or 17,757 cases. Vaccine the keyAverage daily cases too have been increasing in the past three weeks. While it was only around 520 in the first week of March, it jumped to 706 in the second week and 1,300 in the third week. Dr Giridhara Babu, member, Covid technical advisory committee, Karnataka, said: “This is surely a second wave and from what we’ve noticed, most of the cases are those with travel history and the section of the population that had remained indoors during the first wave and was thereby were uninfected. Vaccination is the only way forward and until all priority groups are inoculated, we have no choice but to follow existing protocols of Covid-appropriate behaviour.” So far, Karnataka has administered more than 24.8 lakh doses of vaccines, including more than 3.7 lakh second doses. Other experts TOI spoke with also echoed Dr Babu’s observations and said that even as cases are increasing, the number of deaths is under control. One of them said that this, however, may change if more seniors contract the infection. In the first three weeks of March, the state reported 106 deaths, of which 45 were in the last week. In the 11-week period from January 3, Karnataka reported 333 fatalities, 13.5% of which came in the last week. Better preparedHealth minister K Sudhakar while stating that the government was prepared to mitigate the second wave, said last week: “There was a lack of information and awareness when the pandemic hit us last year. Yet, we were successful in controlling it. We are prepared to fight a second wave if we have one. We have the advantage of the vaccine now which we didn’t have last year. But people must follow precautions and should not let their guard down.” He said that a 1,000-bed Covid Care Centre (CCC) is being readied in Bengaluru and that it would become operational by Monday. “I have instructed officials to ensure vaccine doses are not wasted. I will personally monitor distribution,” he said. As reported by TOI earlier, the state government, while ruling out lockdowns and night curfew warned citizens of a severe second wave if they do not follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, especially that of wearing masks and maintaining physical distance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/karnataka-logs-1-7k-covid-cases-in-24-hours-60-in-bengaluru/articleshow/81629454.cms||---

Other experts TOI spoke with also echoed Dr Babu’s observations and said that even as cases are increasing, the number of deaths is under control. One of them said that this, however, may change if more seniors contract the infection. In the first three weeks of March, the state reported 106 deaths, of which 45 were in the last week. In the 11-week period from January 3, Karnataka reported 333 fatalities, 13.5% of which came in the last week. Better preparedHealth minister K Sudhakar while stating that the government was prepared to mitigate the second wave, said last week: “There was a lack of information and awareness when the pandemic hit us last year. Yet, we were successful in controlling it. We are prepared to fight a second wave if we have one. We have the advantage of the vaccine now which we didn’t have last year. But people must follow precautions and should not let their guard down.” He said that a 1,000-bed Covid Care Centre (CCC) is being readied in Bengaluru and that it would become operational by Monday. “I have instructed officials to ensure vaccine doses are not wasted. I will personally monitor distribution,” he said. As reported by TOI earlier, the state government, while ruling out lockdowns and night curfew warned citizens of a severe second wave if they do not follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, especially that of wearing masks and maintaining physical distance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/karnataka-logs-1-7k-covid-cases-in-24-hours-60-in-bengaluru/articleshow/81629451.cms||---
