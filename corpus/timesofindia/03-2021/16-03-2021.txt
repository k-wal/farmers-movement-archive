Terming the killing of Afghani — instrumental in luring Kashmiri youth into terrorism, especially in Shopian — a “major success”, the IGP lauded security forces for taking extreme care in ensuring no collateral damage in the operation. As a precautionary measure, internet services were suspended in the district on Monday. The encounter began late Saturday after a joint team of the Army, CRPF and J&K Police, based on intelligence inputs, launched a cordon-and-search operation in Rawalpora. The holed-in ultras were offered a chance to surrender but they opened fire on the search party instead, triggering a gunfight. Even as the cordon remained intact, the fire exchange was suspended temporarily during the night. When it resumed early Sunday, Jahangir Ahmad Wani from Shopian’s Rakh Narapora area was killed and a US-made M-4 carbine rifle recovered from the spot even as stone-pelters tried to disrupt the encounter by targeting the security forces. This was the first time since the nullification of Articles 370 and 35A that terrorist sympathisers attempted to thwart an ongoing anti-terror operation. Three houses caught fire near the encounter site as miscreants tried to disturb the operation by creating law and order problems. Several stone-pelters were injured in the clash and many who sustained pellet injuries in police retaliation were hospitalised. The firefight was suspended again on Sunday night to prevent civilian casualties, and ended with Afghani’s killing on Monday morning, IGP Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jaish-commander-killed-in-jk-encounter/articleshow/81518348.cms||M Saleem Pandit
March 16, 2021||India||Handwara narco-terror case: House raided in Bandipora||SRINAGAR: A joint team of the National Investigation Agency, CRPF and J&K Police on Monday raided a house in Wangipora village in north Kashmir’s Bandipora district in connection with the Handwara narco-terror case, in which 21kg heroin and over Rs 1 crore cash were seized last year from members of a drug syndicate operating in J&K. The house owner, Showkat Ahmad Parrey, was arrested along with four others on March 1. On Friday, the NIA claimed to have recovered proceeds of narcotics worth Rs 91 lakh concealed in a field in Samba district’s Gurwal village. One of the arrested men, Romesh Kumar, had received the amount — obtained from the sale of narcotics — from drug smugglers based in Kashmir Valley for personal use as well as channelization to different terrorist groups, an agency spokesperson had said. “Handwara Police initially registered a case in June last year after seizing Rs 20 lakh along with 2kg heroin were from the SUV of one Abdul Momin Peer during a routine check of vehicles at Handwara’s Kairo Bridge,” the spokesperson said. Later that month, the agency took over the case and filed a chargesheet at a special NIA court in Jammu last December against six accused including Peer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/handwara-narco-terror-case-house-raided-in-bandipora/articleshow/81518411.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Eight peers took part in the debate in the main chamber on Monday regarding restrictions imposed on NGOs and academics. It included discussing the detention of Dalit activists, imprisonment of journalists, forced closure of Amnesty International, persecution of non-Hindus and the “damaging effect of the FCRA" on mainstream aid agencies. “Does the UK government agree that it is not possible for India to claim to be the world's largest democracy if they continue to restrict freedom of expression and freedom to organise?” asked Labour peer Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodale. “Will the UK government make representations to India that they must, if they want to be part of the democratic nations of the world, stick to these values absolutely rigidly?” Lord Goldsmith of Richmond Park, minister for the Pacific at the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), representing the UK government at the debate, stressed the UK does raise concerns at a ministerial level with India and said the UK had raised concerns about restrictions on NGOs, human rights activists, and universities with the Indian government several times. Lord Hussain, a British-Pakistani Liberal Democrat peer, took the opportunity to claim that reputable human rights organisations had reported that the Indian army in Kashmir “was involved in illegal rapes and murder with complete impunity” and that thousands of political leaders were being held in Kashmir without trial owing to India’s “notorious” laws. “Will our PM make any representation to the government of India to withdraw these draconian laws and free all Kashmiri political prisoners?” he asked. Baroness Northover, Liberal Democrat peer, said: “The government of India is reported to consider that human rights there are an internal matter. Does the noble lord agree that lessons, especially from the 20th century, show that it is vital that the world pays attention to human rights, even within borders?” But not every peer was comfortable with the debate. “Until recently India has broadly upheld the democratic principles and traditions she inherited from the UK. It is now observable that the Indian government has restructured some hitherto democratic freedoms. I question if it is the task of Her Majesty’s government to raise this with the Indian government where the possible response might be that the UK is following a similar trend. I also think it is quite likely the response will be it is none of our business,” Conservative peer Lord Flight said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-house-of-lords-debates-clampdown-on-ngos-and-universities-in-india/articleshow/81518502.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The BIS is also in talks with Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Slovenia for virtual meetings on this issue, a government official said. “The BIS has shared the Indian Standards catalogue and guidelines for adoption of Indian Standards with National Standards Bodies (NSBs) of 21 countries with whom India has cooperation arrangements,” a senior government official said. The BIS has published over 20,000 Indian Standards encompassing various sectors and around 15,000 of these are indigenous standards. The official said to create awareness on indigenous Indian Standards among developing and least developed countries and to encourage them to use these wherever suitable, the consumer affairs ministry has urged the external affairs ministry to disseminate information on free availability of indigenous Indian Standards in countries through Indian missions. “In response to our initiative for promotion of Indian Standards, we have started receiving requests for virtual meetings to discuss the issue and to explore possibilities for future collaborations. We have held virtual meetings with the national standards bodies of Suriname and Indonesia; and scheduled meetings with the NSBs of Uzbekistan. Further, we are in discussion with countries like Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Slovenia to fix the dates for virtual meetings,” a consumer affairs ministry spokesperson said. He added that BIS has received requests from the NSBs of Haiti and Democratic Republic of the Congo for considering cooperation arrangements with BIS in the field of standardisation and conformity assessment. “We have considered their proposals and sent draft documents through diplomatic channels to them for their consideration and concurrence,” the spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bis-reaches-out-to-developing-nations-for-adoption-of-indian-standards/articleshow/81517862.cms||Dipak K Dash
March 16, 2021||World||Pakistan govt demands poll panel to resign||ISLAMABAD: The Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government on Monday called upon the chief and members of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to resign and the electoral body to be disbanded as the ruling party holds it responsible for failing to conduct the recent senate polls in a transparent manner. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, education minister Shafqat Mahmood, flanked by Information Minister Shibli Faraz and science and technology minister Fawad Chaudhry, demanded the replacement of current ECP’s officials with new ones to restore the public’s confidence in the institution’s ability to organize free and fair elections. The incumbent government and the electoral body have been at odds since the conduct of the bypolls for the Daska assembly seat in Punjab last month, with the ECP accusing the government of massive rigging and ordering a repoll. The relationship worsened further following the ECP’s refusal to implement barcodes in the recent senate elections to allow for cross-checking of the ballot, claiming it did not have sufficient time to implement the measure. Following the victory of opposition’s candidate Yousaf Raza Gilani against the government candidate Hafeez Sheikh in this month’s senate election on Islamabad’s general seat, Prime Minister Imran Khan lashed out at the commission, accusing it of encouraging the use of corrupt practices in the polls. “The ECP completely failed to ensure free and fair polls in the Senate elections. Now, no political party is happy with its performance and they all are criticizing it,” the education minister said, claiming that this validated the PM’s stance that transparent elections could only be ensured if the practice of buying and selling of votes for the upper house of parliament was abolished. “This is a complete failure of the ECP. It failed to fulfill its mandate and responsibilities,” the minister reiterated. “There is only one solution to this crisis: the ECP as it stands now must be abolished to restore some trust in it,” he said, calling upon the commission to resign en masse. “If political parties and the general public do not have trust in the ECP, in its decisions, then the only recourse is for the incumbent ECP leadership to step down and allow for the installation of a new ECP,” he said. “We want the ECP to serve the role of a neutral umpire, which it is not doing right now,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-demands-poll-panel-to-resign/articleshow/81518562.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

---||India||Ongoing vaccination drive slow, will take years to cover entire population: Par panel||NEW DELHI: A parliamentary committee has noted that with less than 1% of the country’s population vaccinated against Covid-19 till mid-February, as per information shared with it by the home ministry, it would take “many years to vaccinate the whole population”. While expressing concern over a large number of people missing the second dose of the vaccine, the panel asked for an attempt be made to cover maximum people as early as possible in the ongoing vaccination drive. After the home ministry, while briefing the standing committee on home affairs last month on status of the Covid-vaccination drive in the country, told the panel that 98.46 lakh vaccine doses had been administered as on February 18, 2021, the committee recommended that all frontline health workers and corona warriors including Central armed police forces and state and Union territory police personnel receive the recommended doses of the vaccine as early as possible. Coronavirus in India: Live updatesOn some people missing the second dose of the vaccine, the panel in its report laid in Parliament on Monday said it was a very serious issue as the virus was mutating and new variants of Covid-19 were being reported in different parts of the world. MHA, on its part, told the committee that the ongoing vaccination drive was fastest in the world to achieve 1-7 million vaccinations and in terms of total number of vaccinations administered till February 18, India was at fourth position across the world despite starting around a month later than other countries. Read AlsoExplained: Why some countries have stopped use of Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccineNEW DELHI: Nearly a dozen countries including Germany, France and Italy have all temporarily suspended their use of AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine after reports last week that some people in Denmark and Norway who got a dose developed blood clots. This despite the fact that there is no concretThe home ministry informed that regular reviews are being undertaken with the states and UTs for increasing the pace of vaccination drive and advisories have been issued to them on various operational aspects of Covid-19 vaccination. Also, a communication strategy was being implemented at the national and state level to raise awareness about the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of Covid-19 vaccines through prompt and consistent dissemination of factual information and to address misinformation related to it. Among the other issues covered in the standing committee report was monitoring of glacial lake outburst flows (GLOFs) in view of the recent glacial outburst at Chamoli in Uttarakhand. The Committee observed that the Himalayan region of Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand had young, fragile and sensitive mountains. It recommended that an urgent assessment be made and organizations like Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, tasked to conduct glaciological studies and prepare glacial lake inventory for Himalayan region using remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS). Besides, the concerned States should be sensitised by the MHA to place adequate early warning mechanism in every district. The committee noted that excessive cutting of trees and use of dynamites on hills/mountains of the Himalayan region for roads, tunnels, dams and other developmental/infrastructural projects was weakening the surrounding hills and may be causing an avalanche, landslides, flash floods, et. It recommended that the MHA coordinate with the concerned agencies to immediately ban the use of dynamites for developmental projects in the Himalayan region.

---||India||Panel: Examine if age limit can be cut to 16 for applicability of Pocso||NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel looking into the issue of ‘atrocities against women and children’ has suggested that the government examine the possibility of reducing the current age threshold of 18 years for applicability of the Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences Act (Posco), to 16 years. The department-related parliamentary standing committee on home affairs chaired by Congress MP Anand Sharma, in its report on offences against women and children tabled in the Rajya Sabha on Monday, also asked the home ministry to advise all states and Union territories to conduct a study on effectiveness of laws in preventing crimes against women and children. This followed from its observation “with grave concern” that the stringent provisions in the law had not acted as a deterrent and made only a limited impact in checking such crimes. Noting that there had been a large number of cases under the Posco Act where the age of the juveniles was below the threshold age of 18 years, the committee comprising MPs from the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha noted that minor sexual offenders may commit more serious and heinous crimes if left “untreated or uncounselled”. “Therefore, it is very important to relook at these provisions because more and more juveniles are getting involved in such crimes,” it said while suggesting that the home ministry sound the ministry of women and child development to review the current age limit of 18 years and see if it can be reduced to 16 years for applicability of Posco Act, 2012. As per the current provisions in Posco Act, a person above 16 years may be tried as an adult in only select cases involving heinous offences like murder and rape, based on the view taken by a juvenile justice board. As per NCRB crime data, the numbers of cases registered under the Posco, Act totalled 32,608, 39,827 and 47,325 in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. This marks an 18% increase in 2019 as compared to 2018. The committee also noted that multiple helpline numbers were being used for different categories of complaints about crimes against women and children, besides varying from state to state. It recommended that there be a single three-digit helpline number that can be uniformly accessed across all states/UTs, while asking MHA to advise all States/UTs to integrate their helpline numbers with pan-India helpline ‘112’. The committee called for an in-depth study on the changing patterns of crimes under various heads to understand the reasons for different types of crime, the types of offenders, etc., so as to ascertain the reasons for the failure of the existing public policy governance mechanisms in curtailing/preventing atrocities and crimes against women and children. This study could be taken up by the Bureau of Police Research & Development under MHA, it said. Disappointed at just 38.55% disbursal out of Nirbhaya Fund, the committee recommended that MHA coordinate with WCD ministry to undertake due consultation with states to improve the utilization of the funds allocated to them. The panel said it was disappointed that women constituted only 10.30% of the police force and asked MHA to advise states/UTs to conduct special recruitment drives for women at all levels in a time-bound manner. Noting inadequacies in registration of complaints relating to crime against women and children at the police station, the committee cited the initiative taken by the Rajasthan Police of conducting decoy operations to check whether such FIRs were being registered or not. It recommended that these decoy operations be conducted at regular intervals throughout the country. The Committee further recommended that CCTV cameras be installed on priority in all shelter homes within a stipulated time frame so as to prevent incidents of physical abuse of the inmates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amend-laws-to-try-those-above-16-years-parl-panel-suggests-changes-in-posco-act/articleshow/81519146.cms||Bharti Jain

The standing committee on home affairs, chaired by Congress MP Anand Sharma, in its report on ‘atrocities against women and children’ tabled in Rajya Sabha on Monday, noted that the unprecedented rise in domestic violence and trafficking of women and children Covid-19 outbreak was mainly due to disruption in economic activities, work from home and family spending more time at home during lockdowns. “The female migrant workers and their children were trafficked and had gone missing during lockdowns,” the committee observed while seeking steps under both rural and urban employment guarantee schemes focusing especially on poor women, to ensure that cash transfers through DBT in their names could continue for longer. The panel added that a moratorium in rural areas on interest rates for self-help groups on loan repayments would also help because they are the women who are supporting their families in a big way. “Some of these steps would raise women's participation in employment and also lead to a reduction in violence against them,” it stated in its report tabled in the Rajya Sabha on Monday. NCW received a total of 23,722 complaints last year, the highest being 7,715 under the head ‘right to live with dignity’, 5,297 under ‘protection of women from domestic violence’, and 3,788 under ‘harassment of married women/dowry harassment’. Of the total 23,722 complaints, 19,489 were from April onwards, after the lockdown was announced. As many as 1,169 complaints of domestic violence were received between April 1 and June 31, 2020, coinciding with the full lockdown period. NGO Jagori received 478 complaints of domestic violence during Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns (March 18 to June 29), 2020. As submitted by the NGO, the impact of the pandemic and lockdowns on women and children inter-alia includes increased unpaid care work during the lockdown, increase in child marriage, increased violence and harassment at home, loss of jobs particularly in the informal sector, lack of women’s access to sexual and reproductive health care services, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ncw-records-sharp-spike-in-crimes-against-women-during-lockdown-parl-panel/articleshow/81519674.cms||Bharti Jain

The NIA probe has shown that “someone” opened the car with its key, drove it and parked it in assistant police inspector Waze’s housing society Saket in Thane. Later, the vehicle was later found near Ambani’s residence. Sources said Waze had collected the digital video recorder containing CCTV images from his housing society, which the NIA claims has been damaged.

Waze was part of the crime intelligence unit (CIU) that initially probed the case. A resident of the society confirmed that Waze had taken the DVR but declined to elaborate. The NIA, which has taken over the DVR, said it has been damaged. “If we get the footage it will be of great help to establish the fact that Waze orchestrated the terror scare outside Ambani’s house. We are trying to retrieve data from the DVR,” said an official. Waze has reportedly admitted to his role but not disclosed the motive, sources said.

According to the HRD ministry, of the 39,822 sanctioned posts across IITs, NITs, IIMs, IISERs, IIITs, central universities and other institutes funded by the Centre, 14,372 (or 36.1%) are vacant. The vacancies are caused by retirement, resignation and due to demands brought on by increased student strength, according to the ministry. A director of one of the institutions said: “Compared to the first 50 years, the number of these institutions have more than doubled in the past two decades. However, there has not been a matching growth in our PhDs. The institutions do not always get the promised funds.”  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Data specific to IITs, NITs, IIMs and IISERs shows that of the 20,122 sanctioned faculty posts, 7,683 (or 38%) are vacant, while it is 34% for central universities, IIITs, NITTRs (National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research) and other centrally-funded institutions together. TV Mohandas Pai, chairman, Board of Manipal Global, says: “The primary problem is that of money. The Centre must seriously consider Anil Kakodkar committee recommendations. Despite knowing in advance retirement dates and timeline of expansion, there is no proper planning. The Centre must reimagine the way institutions function and revisit the rigid norms that set faculty-student ratios.” While IIMs have the highest percentage of vacant posts (74%), they need to collectively fill up only 934 positions. Comparatively, IITs together need to fill up 3,876 positions, while it is 2,736 for NITs. The IISERs, with 137 vacant positions, are the best among the elite institutions have just 10.6% shortage. Prof S Sadagopan, director, IIIT-B, said: “Hiring, growing and retaining faculty is a challenge for every institution in the world. It is no different at MIT or Harvard as high-quality people are in short supply. That said, institutions deliberately don’t aim to fill up 100% posts as there needs to be room to infuse young blood periodically and have positions for the best when they are available.” The central universities need to collectively fill up 6,210 posts. Further, of the 58,138 sanctioned non-teaching posts across these institutions and universities, nearly 13,101 are vacant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/38-faculty-posts-lying-vacant-at-indias-premier-institutions/articleshow/81521268.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||India||If Nota tops, should all the candidates be rejected: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: Eight years after giving voters the ‘none of the above’ (Nota) option in elections, the SC on Monday asked the Centre and the Election Commission whether it would be legally permissible to reject all candidates in the fray if Nota votes exceeded that of the candidate securing the highest number of votes. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian agreed to entertain a PIL filed by advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay but said such a move could cause disruptions in formation of Parliament and assemblies after elections. Senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy, appearing for Upadhyay, said though Nota was an option for voters, it didn’t appear to have prodded political parties to select “good candidates” sans criminal antecedents as the number of Nota votes had no impact on the outcome of elections. “The petitioner wants that if Nota votes exceed that of the winning candidate, then the election should be cancelled and fresh election be held,” she said. The CJI said in our electoral system, this could be counter-productive. “Imagine a political party having influence over voters succeeding in convincing them to cast negative votes in many constituencies. This would result in many seats in Parliament and assemblies going vacant and make it difficult for constitution of Houses. Moreover, a constituency would go unrepresented for a long time,” the bench said. Guruswamy said rejection of all candidates would make political parties select those with clean track records and this would go a long way in preventing criminalisation of politics. The CJI asked, “Do you think political parties do not do this exercise?” Times ViewIf “NOTA” gets more votes than any of the candidates, it means the electorate believes none of the candidates are fit for the job. In such a case, there should be a re-election in which the rejected candidates cannot contest. That’s what would make NOTA potent and meaningful. Without such an option, it is a token gesture. If the proposal seems too radical, it could be first tried out in local body elections before proceeding further.The petitioner replied, “If Nota gets a majority of votes, then election to that constituency should be cancelled and a fresh election should be held within a particular time. The candidates rejected in nullified elections should not be allowed to participate in the fresh election. The right to reject contesting candidates and elect a new candidate, if Nota gets maximum votes, is not only necessary to ensure free and fair election but is also essential for de-criminalisation and de-communalisation of polity.” Nota as an option was introduced in EVMs on the basis of the SC judgment in PUCL case on September 27, 2013. The SC had said, “For democracy to survive, it is essential that the best available men should be chosen as people’s representatives. This can be best achieved through men of high moral and ethical values, who win elections on a positive vote. Thus, in a vibrant democracy, the voter must be given an opportunity to choose Nota, which will compel political parties to nominate a sound candidate.” On October 29, 2013, the EC had issued a circular saying in the event of Nota getting votes which exceed the number of votes polled by any candidate, then the one with the highest number of positive votes would be declared winner. This meant that even if Nota got a majority of votes cast in an election, it would have no impact on the outcome of the poll. On August 21, 2018, the SC had quashed an EC notification providing for Nota option in ballot papers for Rajya Sabha elections, saying the negative vote option would be applicable only for direct elections to Lok Sabha and assemblies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/if-nota-tops-should-all-the-candidates-be-rejected-supreme-court/articleshow/81521609.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Party old guards from Singur threatened to take the “ultimate course” if the BJP brass didn’t replace 88-year-old candidate Rabindranath Bhattacharya, a former minister who joined the party just days before the nominee list was released. BJP supporters, led by a local leader, Santosh Pandey, had “mobbed” party observer and Madhya Pradesh health minister Vishwal Sarang at a private lodge in Apurbapur on Sunday, minutes after Bhattacharya was given a ticket. On Monday, a BJP worker, Nirupam Mukherjee, made a failed suicide bid on railway tracks, fearing that a former Trinamool Congress strongman who recently joined the BJP, Debaprasad Biswas, may get the ticket from Hooghly’s Saptagram. BJP veteran Krishna Bhattacharya from Konnagar has started writing graffiti, projecting herself as an independent candidate from Uttarpara against the “corrupt and tolabaj” official BJP candidate without naming Prabir Ghoshal, who switched loyalties from Trinamool to BJP. Trinamool leaders in Hooghly were amused at the wrangling match within the “country’s largest party” that had planned to make hay of Trinamool desertions while Bengal BJP leaders went into damage control mode to pacify the ranks. Most Hooghly seats go to polls on April 6 and 10. At Chandernagore’s Bagbazar More, angry BJP supporters took out a rally on Monday afternoon demanding that local candidates be given a chance after the party gave a ticket to Bengal BJP office-bearer Dipanjan Guha.

---||India||Kerala HC allows transgender woman to join NCC||KOCHI: The Kerala high court has ordered that a transgender person be allowed to join the National Cadet Corps and has also directed that the law be amended to include transgenders in the NCC. Justice Anu Sivaraman issued the directive after considering a petition filed by Hina Haneefa, a student of University College in Thiruvananthapuram. The court said the fact that the NCC Act does not recognise the third gender or that detailed guidelines are yet to be introduced for the integration of persons of the third gender into the NCC cannot be justification to deny the petitioner entry. Ruling that denial of enrolment in the NCC in this case is unsustainable, the court said the petitioner is entitled to participate in the selection process and to be enrolled if successful. It was pointed out by the court that the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 recognises the right of transgenders to a life of dignity and prohibits discrimination against them. Provisions of the NCC Act cannot preclude the operation of the law on transgender rights, the court said. The court also said the enactment on transgender rights was one intended to give effect to the rights guaranteed to such persons under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 of the Constitution and that it has to be kept in mind when considering cases of this nature. A transgender has not only the right to be recognised as a transgender but also the right to self-perceived gender identity as per the law, the court noted. Section 6 of NCC Act, which allows only males and females to enrol themselves in the NCC, was challenged by the petitioner. The NCC had contended that there was no provision in law to allow the entry of transgenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-hc-allows-transgender-woman-to-join-ncc/articleshow/81521617.cms||---
---||India||Army recruitment scam: CBI books 6 Lieutenant Colonels, 2 Majors||NEW DELHI: CBI has filed an FIR against 23 people, including 17 Army personnel, in connection with a case regarding allegations of bribery and irregularities in recruitment through the Service Selection Board (SSB), reports Rajshekher Jha. Those booked by CBI include six Lieutenant Colonels, two Majors, a Major’s parents and wife and many others from the ranks of Naib Subedars, Havildars and Sepoys, the agency said. In all, 23 people have been named, including six civilians. The agency on Monday conducted searches at 30 places in 13 cities covering Army establishments and cantonments besides civilian areas. CBI is set to serve notice to the accused to join the investigations. They will be questioned in the coming days. The Army has also provided CBI with their internal inquiry report detailing the findings against each officer. Money trails of over Rs 50 lakh through some bank accounts of civilians has already been established but the cash part has been mentioned as “undisclosed” in the FIR. Sources say it could be to the tune of several crores of rupees. The cases was registered on March 13 on a complaint from an Army officer, Brigadier V K Purohit. The complaint from the Army states that on February 28, an input was received about alleged involvement of serving personnel in accepting bribe for clearing medical review exam of temporarily rejected candidates at the Base Hospital in New Delhi. As the allegations involved the SSB, the issue was taken up at the highest level. SSBs are held for selection of both permanent and short service commission officers into the armed forces. An inquiry was initiated with assistance from the Military Intelligence which revealed “sufficient evidence of culpability of service personnel and civilians as recipients of the money trail”. The Army detected gross malpractices in a selection centre in Punjab, which conducts Services Selection Board (SSB) tests for officer-level entry into the armed forces. The case was subsequently handed over to CBI. This case comes on the heels of another case where two Majors and others were arrested for leak of exam paper for recruitment of jawans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-recruitment-scam-cbi-books-6-lieutenant-colonels-2-majors/articleshow/81521643.cms||Rajshekhar Jha
---||Patna||No respite from traffic snarls on Patna-Ara-Chhapra route||PATNA/ARA/CHHAPRA: Frequent traffic snarls are giving a nightmarish experience to commuters on Patna-Ara-Chhapra route. Nawada resident Malti Pandey could not keep an appointment with her doctor in Patna on Thursday after being caught in a heavy traffic snarl from Koilwar to Bihta. Another resident of Kayam Nagar under the Koilwar police station area Shashi Kant Tripathi too had to postpone the scheduled surgery of his son in a Patna hospital due to the traffic jam near Bihta. “Though the new Koilwar bridge facilitates the movement across the river Sone and shares the traffic load with the old bridge, the long queue of heavy vehicles on both sides of the river often creates heavy jam,” said one Neeraj Kumar of Koilwar. “Even the Ara-Chapra four lane, Koilwar-Chandi road and Sakkadi- Nasariganj road also face similar situation on most of the working days,” Neeraj added. Houses and shops situated on both sides of the national highway between Koilwar and Ara like Kulharia Sakaddi, Gidha, Kayamnagar and Dhanupra are the worst hit. Admitting the problem, Patna DM Chandrasekhar Singh said Saran’s new traffic plan led to congestion on Chhapra-Bhojpur and Koilwar-Bihta road. The additional chief secretary through a video conferencing held recently had suggested certain measures to ease the situation. "Concerned with the situation and problems faced by people, we arranged several rounds of border meetings between the SDO and the SDPO Patna and their counterparts in Bhojpur to find out a solution,” the DM said. Saran range DIG Manu Maharaj, however, said the new traffic plan was enforced after joint video conferencing with the home secretary, commissioners and DIGs. “We are monitoring the new traffic rules. We have also created a WhatsApp group to monitor the difficulties, if any,” he told this newspaper on Saturday. Bhojpur DM Roshan Kushwaha said the road near Doriganj in Chhapra is undergoing repair and this slows down the traffic between Doriganj and Koilwar leading to snarls. “We have deputed a traffic DSP at Koilwar with sufficient police force to keep the movement of vehicles smooth,” the DM said adding, “A taskforce constituted by the government with DMs of Patna, Bhojpur and Saran is also in regular contact on the traffic jam issue.” According to the locals, overloaded sand-laden trucks are the major cause of snarl. The overloaded tractors and trucks spill sand which form a thick layer on the Koilwar bridge and on Ara-Chhapra four-lane road causing vehicles to skid. At some places on Ara -Chhapra four lane road, especially from Jamalpur to Babura, the road looks like ploughed fields due to long queue of heavy sand-laden trucks and tractors. A police official posted at Koilwar said: “We take strict action against drivers of overloaded sand-laden vehicles. Not only are the vehicles seized, heavy fines are also imposed. However, some drivers in hurry park their vehicles in haphazard manner which further aggravates the problem.” In view to provide relief to the locals at Saran, the administration allows some trucks to go to Ara and Patna via Koilwar bridge and JP Setu respectively during night hours. This gives partial relief to people in Saran from traffic snarls at Chirand and Dorignaj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-respite-from-traffic-snarls-on-patna-ara-chhapra-route/articleshow/81517834.cms||H K Verma

After a series of meetings between convenors, external examiners and schools on Monday, it was decided that while a gap of two to three hours is enough to sterilize or fumigate physics and biology laboratories, it will not be possible to do so with the chemistry laboratories where spilling of chemicals and use of apparatus will need longer cleaning time. Schools are in the process of finalizing the practical examination dates. Students will be divided into batches of 12-15 and called either in the morning or the afternoon. Only for chemistry will there be just one batch on one day. “We met and decided that we cannot take the risk of sanitizing the chemistry laboratory in a hurry and bring in a second batch on the same day. This can be done in case of physics and biology. But we have to be as careful as possible with kids. Each batch is being given a time which is just half an hour before the designated laboratory practical examination time. We will seat them in a sanitized room and then lead them into a sanitized laboratory,” said Annapurna Mukherjee, vice-principal of St Augustine’s Day School, who attended one meeting on Monday. St James School has multiple batches because it has a large number of science students. The physics and biology examinations will be held on a single day. The school will convert all laboratories to hold the physics practicals and the same thing will be done for biology. “We have held meetings with the convenors and external examiners and have been permitted to do this. However, for chemistry, we have to spread it over multiple days,” said principal T H Ireland.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chem-practicals-to-be-held-over-several-days/articleshow/81519091.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

As per the fresh security blueprint, cops are now set to close down more than 15 bridges or flyovers and also block maximum feeder lanes leading to the main roads for stricter vigilance from day two onwards till March 21. On Monday, cops had already closed Ajni and Gowari flyovers after failing to check vehicles plying on them. City police chief Amitesh Kumar said too many relaxations marred enforcement of guidelines on day one. Based on the first day’s experience, Kumar has also requested NMC to modify the existing extended restriction guidelines to accommodate some crucial changes. “Police suggested that vegetable shops, carts, grocery outlets, meat retailers and so on should be allowed only between 12 noon and 4pm so that the combined crowd of purchasers and office-goers do not swell the population on the roads in the morning,” he said, adding, “We have also told the NMC to stop construction activities and allow teachers to work from home,” said the top cop. A stricter focus on day two would be to also seize vehicles and impound licences of citizens on roads without valid reasons. On the first day, cops detained around 576 vehicles. A larger number of the vehicles were detained but many of the owners managed to get them released claiming plying for exempted services. Kumar, who had to summon emergency meetings after the experience of the first two hours on Monday, also decided to check private offices where the NMC had allowed 10 percent employees for the financial year ending work. The top cop’s decision came following observations of the field units that maximum people checked by personnel at nakabandi points were ‘office-goers’ who created a big flow of vehicular movements between 9am and 11.30am and also between 5pm and 7.30pm forcing the khaki department to bring private premises under the scanner. Kumar said the order was only for offices or organizations registered under the Company’s Act to function with the prescribed number of employees but a large number of non-registered companys were also found operating with bigger numbers. “We have already alerted the civic body about major violations by offices. Police have also decided to form smaller teams at the zonal level to make surprise visits and take legal action against offices,” said the CP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-to-shut-down-flyovers-most-feeder-roads-on-day-2/articleshow/81518014.cms||Soumitra Bose

The 22-year old left-handed batsman, who not only scored 56 runs but also won the Man of the Match award, was born on July 18, 1998, in Patna. He started playing for Jharkhand in the 2014-15 season as Bihar did not have a team registered with the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI) owing to a dispute between rival cricket associations here. Kishan’s family members and friends are overwhelmed by his feat and the all-round praise he is getting. His coach and fellow cricketers are as elated. Ishan’s father Pranav Kumar Pandey told this newspaper on Monday, "It is always a proud moment for a father to be known by his son’s name. We are feeling very proud at the moment. The way he is playing with such maturity, we are certain that he will grow even more in his career. He should utilise the opportunities and learn from his senior players." Pandey, who is a businessman, further said, "We were so impressed by his dedication towards cricket since childhood that we never stopped him from chasing his dreams." WRD and information and public relations department minister Sanjay Jha met Ishan's father on Monday and congratulated him for his son’s achievement. Ishan’s mother Suchitra Singh, a lawyer, said she's on cloud nine since Sunday after her son became the second Indian player to score a half-century in his first international cricket match. "We are pleased as we were eagerly waiting for this day to come. He has fulfilled all our dreams and made us very proud and I pray that he continues to play well," she said. Ishan's mother added, "A mother’s intuitions are never wrong. He had a passion for cricket even as a child and he has proved himself." Amikar Dayal, who was Ishan’s first cricket coach in Patna, said he trained Ishan since the latter was six. "It was highly expected of him to play well in his debut match I was very hopeful that he will be excellent on the field. To score more than 50 runs in the first match is a big deal for a youngster. He will give his best in his second match as well and I expect him to play better inning," he said. Dayal, who is the chairperson of a Patna-based cricket academy, added, "I was also a left-handed batsman, so it was quite easy for us to communicate and that helped him a lot. It was also easier for me to guide him as I knew what is convenient for a left-handed batsman." On the success of Ishan, the president of Bihar Players Association and RJD spokesperson, Mritunjay Tiwari, said: "Ishan has won the hearts of not only the people of Bihar but the entire country. He is the son of the soil of Bihar, and we are very proud and overwhelmed. We expect to see him soon playing test cricket as well." Other budding cricketers in the city also praised Ishan. Kumar Mridul, a player in Bihar’s Ranji Trophy team said, "The kind of Cricket he has been playing, down the line it was expected from him. I wish for him that he goes on to play for India in all three formats."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-boy-ishan-shines-in-t-20-debut-draws-praise-from-legends/articleshow/81517852.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: BJP gears up for panchayat polls||PATNA: The BJP will kick-start preparations for the upcoming panchayat elections from Tuesday. For the first time, the saffron party has decided to extend its support to the zila parishad candidates. BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said on Monday, “Preparations for the three-tier panchayat polls at the division level will begin on Tuesday. The district in-charge and the workers will chalk out a strategy at the meeting.” He added, “Since the party aims at promoting leadership at the grassroots level, women, dalits and candidates belonging to the minority community will be given priority in the elections.” Jaiswal revealed that several party workers, who had missed the opportunity to contest the recently held state assembly polls, would have an option to make it to the zila parishad. Zila parishad members are elected by the representatives of panchayats, as a result of which they have an influence on the latter. According to the decision, the division level committee will select five names for the district board members. After screening, it will recommend three names and the state committee will take a final call before announcing the names of the candidates. The party workers will subsequently be asked to ensure the victory of the candidates. “The BJP will render its support to one deserving and fair candidate contesting for the post of zila parishad in every area of the district board,” the BJP state president said. He, however, clarified that the candidates would be selected on the basis of their fair background by the members of the party’s core committee in every district. There are 1,161 posts of zila parishad members in the state. The panchayat polls will be conducted in April-May through electronic voting machines for which the state government has already sanctioned Rs 122 crore. On the other hand, the RJD has also announced to lend its support to the contestants of the three-tier panchayat polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-gears-up-for-panchayat-polls/articleshow/81518104.cms||Ramashankar

The victims were identified as Uttam Kumar Raut (20) and Laxmi Kumari alias Lachho (17), residents of Uttar Hajipur under Gogri block in Khagaria district. Police said the incident took place around 1pm when the girl had gone to attend her tuition classes. Gogri DSP (trainee) Jyoti Kumari said Uttam used to teach the students in his at Uttar Hajipur. The police rushed to the site within minutes after noticing thick smoke emitting from the hut as it was hardly 100 metre away from the police station. Both were charred to death. Eyewitnesses, however, said the main entrance gate of the hut being used as coaching centre-cum-residence of Uttam was locked from inside. The girl’s father, Mantu Poddar, said his daughter was to be married off on April 16. “Though Laxmi had stopped going to school, she used to attend coaching classes along with two sisters at Uttam’s coaching institute. On Monday, she had gone there alone,” an investigating officer quoted the girl's father as saying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mystery-shrouds-death-of-private-tutor-minor-girl/articleshow/81517797.cms||Ramashankar

---||Business||Startups see 37% more first-time global backers||CHENNAI: The success demonstrated by Indian startups in turning into unicorns (valued at $1 billion or more) and the massive global private equity investment drive in 2020 by Reliance Industries brought record global investor interest to the country’s startup ecosystem in the pandemic year. Despite geopolitical tensions halting Chinese investment, around 59 international investors made their first-time PE-VC investment in India in 2020, according to data analysed by consulting firm Praxis Global Alliance. This is a 37% rise in the number of global first-time investors who invested in Indian startups, given that the corresponding number stood at 43 in 2019. Not only did Indian startups attract more foreign investors, they also saw larger bets and raised greater capital for the ecosystem in 2020. The top 10 new global investors in 2020 participated in around $7 billion worth of deals, while this was only $1.2 billion in 2019, data showed. This includes co-investment by other players in the same deals. There were sovereign funds like Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which pooled almost $4 billion into RIL’s fund-raising for its group companies. Other instances of global firms tapping India included Luxor Capital Group’s investment in Zomato, Alkeon Capital’s backing of Byju’s, and South Korea’s NXC Corporation investing in DMI Finance. International investment came in from over 15 countries. Of these, 60% investors had their headquarters in the US, followed by 7% who had their headquarters in Japan and South Korea each. The Middle East region was another major investor base. The investment deals by such first-time international backers were highest in consumer apps and platforms (14 deals) followed by Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) & Artificial Intelligence (AI) at 11 deals. Praxis Global Alliance managing partner and CEO Madhur Singhal said Indian internet companies are scaling up rapidly, prompting global investors to participate in the ecosystem’s growth. “Also, many experienced India fund managers at global investment firms who understand the nuances of the startups here have turned entrepreneurs and set up their own funds,” he added. As of December 2020, India was home to 37 unicorns with 14 companies making it to the elite list in the pandemic year alone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/startups-see-37-more-first-time-global-backers/articleshow/81518489.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Patna||Govt schemes lead to rise in girls’ enrolment in schools: Academics||PATNA: Phenomenal rise in the enrolment of girls in secondary schools in the state is not only indicative of ever-declining gender gap, but also of an imminent social transformation. Education of girls is vital to the cause of social justice and economic change, social scientists and academics said. They said the level of literacy and educational attainment are important indicators of development of any given society and one cannot exclude women in the development of any society as they equally contribute to the progress of the society and the economy. Bihar State Progressive Intellectuals’ Forum convener and Bihar Public Service Commission’s former member Shiv Jatan Thakur attributed the recent rise in girls’ enrolment in high schools to the ever-growing awareness of the guardians towards education of their female child. “The dropout rate of girls is far less than that of boys who are forced to leave the schools to contribute to their family income as child labour,” he said. Thakur pointed out that the recent government incentive for women’s appointment to the extent of 35% in government jobs has added impetus to the literacy and education of girls. “Free education up to the master’s degree stage has played a seminal role in the increased awareness and motivation for the girls in the pursuit of education,” he added. Patna University (PU) education department’s senior academic Khagendra Kumar said the incentives provided by the Nitish government to the rural as well as urban girls for pursuing their education have been bearing fruit. “Scholarships and schemes like Balika Poshak Yojana and Mukhyamantri Balika Cycle have brought in positive changes in the minds of the poor in recent years and they are eagerly sending their wards to schools. Cash incentives given to the girls after they pass the matriculation, Intermediate and graduation examinations provide soothing relief to the financially-stressed guardians, who more often than not spend the amount in meeting their urgent domestic needs,” Kumar said. PU economics department’s former head Nawal Kishore Chaudhary too said award of financial incentives motivated girls to pursue education. “The social psychology has also changed considerably as the people of even the rural areas are becoming quite conscious of the importance of girls’ education and they do not hesitate in sending their daughters to schools and colleges. The number of girl students in Patna University has already increased as compared to their male counterparts and it would be no wonder if girls overtake boys even in schools,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-schemes-lead-to-rise-in-girls-enrolment-in-schools-academics/articleshow/81517431.cms||B K Mishra

The duo had completed both the vaccination doses as healthcare workers (HCWs). The couple told the media on Monday that they had no major symptoms, and have home quarantined themselves. The duo had got tested as part of their duty and had no apparent symptoms associated with the viral infection. It is the second instance in the past three days where the doctors who have completed both the shots have got infected with the virus. Dr Mukesh Maheshwari, a city-based pathologist and a committee member in Gujarat chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA), said that the incidents should not be seen as detrimental to the ongoing vaccination drive. “None of the vaccinations can claim 100% efficacy – while some have claimed 70% effectiveness, others have claimed 81%. But vaccination is required to ensure that even when a person is infected, the morbidity and mortality remain low,” he said. Meanwhile, the surge in Covid-19 cases in Gujarat continued with 890 new cases in 24 hours – 37 cases every hour – the highest in 69 days. While Surat city recorded all-time daily high cases at 240, Ahmedabad recorded 75-day high at 205. In wake of the surge in cases, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Monday announced restriction in commercial establishments’ timings from March 16 in eight wards with highest surge – the shops and restaurants would not be allowed to operate after 10 pm in Jodhpur, Bodakdev, Thaltej, Gota, Paldi, Ghatlodia and Maninagar. It's the second such restriction imposed by the civic authority – earlier such restrictions were imposed in September last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/doc-couple-tests-covid-positive-despite-taking-both-doses-of-vax/articleshow/81519483.cms||---

The Manekchowk and Raipur Darwaja food markets will also close by 10pm. A notification issued by the AMC stated the decision was taken after the corporation reported a surge in the cases in these areas. This is the second time such restrictions have been imposed in these areas. In September, the AMC after issuing warnings and appeals to the youth to follow social distancing and wear marks, had decided that shops and establishments except medical shops on 27 stretches of road would have to close at 10pm.

Similarly, there is no clarity on the post of chairperson in Parvathipuram municipality. As in Vizianagaram Municipal Corporation, the post is reserved for a woman (BC) candidate.

---||Allahabad||Four cops suspended after four persons die of hooch in Pratapgarh||Prayagraj: Four policemen including a station officer, a sub-inspector and two beat constables, posted at Nawabganj police station of Pratapgarh district, have been placed under suspension on Monday. The action was taken following the death of four persons, including a couple, who allegedly died after consuming spurious liquor in village Manoharpur Rampur Dabi under the limits of Sangramgarh police station, Pratapgarh district in the past 48 hours. Senior police officials including IG (Prayagraj range) K P Singh on Monday rushed to the spot and carried out detailed investigations. IG told TOI , “Initial investigations revealed that four people including a woman died after consuming an excessive quantity of spurious liquor in Manohapur Rampur Dabi village in the past 48 hours.

---||Lucknow||Temple ‘tree leaves’ known for anti-diabetic properties attracts locals||Prayagraj: A popular temple, located at the Manmohan crossing of Katra is hogging the limelight these days. However, the temple is not attracting devotees due to any 'miracle' claimed by some devotee as in most cases. Instead, the crowd is a result of a novel initiative by a septuagenarian who distributes 'unique' leaves to locals, suffering from diabetes. For the past two years, right after the aarti at the temple, people can be seen waiting for their turn to receive few leaves from 72-year old Gopal Tiwari who carefully segregates the best quality of leaf of the African bitter leaf tree/plant, which is consumed by people for controlling blood sugar levels. “The plant is also found in India with medicinal properties and the Botanical name of this plant is Vernonia amygdalina belonging to the family of marigold. Plants of this family are herbaceous (with exception of Vernonia amygdalina which is the only tree) and a few research work has proven its anti-Diabetes properties”, said the former head of the Department of Botany at Allahabad University, Prof Anupam Dikshit. “It was two years back when I was told about the benefits of the leaves of this unique plant and how it can control blood sugar level. After giving it to my wife and observing the benefits, I have been giving it to several people and they are being benefited”, said Tiwari. Ayurvedic Physician Dr GS Tomer of Prayagraj, said, “Diabetes can be controlled by consuming the leaves of this tree as the borderline sugar patient can consume two leaves in the morning before breakfast while moderate diabetes can be controlled by consuming two leaves before meals. One can experience the antidiabetic properties of the plant after getting the sugar levels tested after 30 days of consumption”. “Since the leaves are quite bitter, the patients can keep the leaves in the mouth like beetle leave without chewing. As the saliva reacts with the leaves and its juice, in diluted form, it can be gulped with a tolerable level of bitterness”, suggests Prof Dikshit. Commenting on the availability of the plant, Tiwari said, “Leaves of the plant are available round the year and new plants can be raised through stem cutting. In the summer season, the plant grows faster”. “I have been taking these leaves for the past six months and my blood sugar level is well under control”, said one of the daily visitor of the temple, Raju Yadav. Likewise, Avadesh Gupta says, “After initial days of visits to the temple, I have procured the stem of the plant and have grown it in my backyard and consume its leaves daily”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/temple-tree-leaves-known-for-anti-diabetic-properties-attracts-locals/articleshow/81516927.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Infighting, split votes hastened TDP defeat||Vijayawada: As the TDP examines its failure to script a victory in municipal elections, one of the reasons that hit the party’s performance is the Jana Sena which captured a vote share of over eight per cent in five major municipal corporations, including Vijayawada and Greater Visakhapatnam. Following its defeat, the TDP is focusing on analysing the factors that led to the party’s poor show in a majority of municipalities and municipal corporations. The party had hoped for a comfortable win in Vijayawada and Guntur following the agitation to retain Amaravati as capital, banking on anti-incumbency to help them secure urban local bodies (ULBs). Though the TDP secured a sizeable number of votes, these failed to translate into seats. In Vijayawada, the TDP managed to win only 14 seats though it achieved a vote share of around 32%. As many as 21 TDP leaders lost to YSRC with a narrow difference and Jana Sena candidates played a key role in splitting the votes. Infighting between MP Kesineni Nani and MLC Buddha Venkanna was another major factor that impacted the party’s vote share in Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC). The party lost its hold in Vijayawada West constituency after key leaders such as Buddha Venkanna and Nagul Meera stayed away from campaigns after infighting. Nor did damage control measures by party chief N Chandrababu Naidu give positive results. Further, poor coordination between candidates and the party top leadership and failure of ground-level workers in poll management contributed to the party’s defeat in VMC. TDP city president Buddha Venkana accepted that infighting within the party affected cadets at the ground-level. “TDP has a substantial vote share in the city. Our party men and the ground-level got confused with differences between top leadership. We will definitely focus on resolving the issues and building the party from the root level,” said Buddha Venkanna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/infighting-split-votes-hastened-tdp-defeat/articleshow/81517261.cms||Venu Lanka

It has also made it mandatory for passengers, who travel to Bihar from states registering high Covid cases, to carry their test reports to airports. These decisions were taken at a high level meeting of the crisis management committee on Monday evening. Although no restrictions on Holi celebrations inside houses have been imposed, the health department has requested people to avoid huge gatherings in order to stay safe. The government is also planning to limit the number of guests at any event. Special vigil will also be kept on passengers coming from Kerala, Maharashtra and Punjab, the three states which are contributing the maximum number of new Covid cases each day. Those travelling to Bihar from these states from March 17 will have to show their RT-PCR or rapid antigen test reports at the airport. “Those passengers, who do not have a report, will have to wait at the airport and undergo a Covid test first,” said a source present in the meeting that was attended by principal secretary Deepak Kumar, chief secretary Arun Kumar Singh, development commissioner Aamir Subhani, health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit, and all the divisional commissioners, district magistrates and senior police officials. Officials recalled how Bihar had witnessed a surge in Covid cases last year with a huge inflow of people from areas with a high infection rate. Hence, special instructions have been given to the DMs to keep tabs on the people travelling by trains and ensure that Covid care centres have all the necessary arrangements. Officials have also been told to regulate the entry of visitors in all government offices, including secretariat, collectorate and block offices. According to the data shared by the Union ministry of health and family welfare, 85% of the new cases were reported from six states. Maharashtra (16,620) reported the highest number of cases in 24 hours, followed by Kerala (1,792).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-to-impose-restrictions-on-public-gatherings-again/articleshow/81517338.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The gates of Belurmath were kept closed for physical participation because of the pandemic situation. Though devotees could not come to Belurmath to pay their respects, more than 35,000 watched the programmes that had been lined up and streamed both on the Belurmath website and on You Tube. The programmes started with Mangalarati at 4am and Usha Kirtan thereafter when senior monks led a procession that did the rounds of the main temple singing bhajans and kirtans. Special puja of the Paramhansa and homa were done at the natmandir of the Sri Ramakrishna Temple at 7 am. These were, however, not streamed virtually. The programmes were shown from 8 am onwards as Sri Ramakrishna Vandana started. Thousands had joined by the time Swami Devrajananda started his readings from the Ramakrishna Kathamrita and then again during the Bhakti Geeti that was led by Swami Ekachittananda. Swami Amiteshananda read out from Sri Ramkrishna Leelaprasanga, another popular volume related to the teachings of Paramhansa. Like every year, a cultural programme was also organised by Ramakrishna Mission Saradapith — Jagabandana Bondi Tomae — which was a musical tribute to Ramakrishna. The evening discourses on the life and teachings of Sri Ramakrishna were given by general secretary of RKM, Swami Suvirananda and other senior monks like Swami Tattwavidananda, Swami Muktidananda and Swami Sarvottamananda. “We have to be safe and keep our devotees safe, too,” Swami Suvirananda said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ramakrishna-birth-anniv-goes-online/articleshow/81518018.cms||---

The minister was responding to a question raised by Rajya Sabha MP from Bihar Sushil Kumar Modi regarding the status of NH-83. “Although there is a target to widen the Patna-Gaya-Dobhi NH-83 by the end of 2022, little work on the 127km stretch has been completed so far due to non-availability of required land,” Gadkari said. Of the 127km stretch, package 1 is from 0 to 39km, package 2 from 39 to 83km and package 3 from 83 to 127km. Land has to be acquired in 28 villages of Patna, Gaya and Jehanabad districts. The Union minister said the work had started in 2015 with an initial grant of Rs 2,264 crore. “However, the work could not be completed on time due to non-acquisition of land and non-execution of work by the contractor. The work had restarted in November-December 2020 with a revised estimate of Rs 5519 crore,” he said. Gadkari said the Centre, National Highways Authority of India and the Japan International Cooperation Agency will make funds available for the project. In reply to another question raised by Modi, Union minister of chemicals and fertilizer D V Sadananda Gowda said production from Barauni Fertiliser Plant would start from December this year. The minister said 85% of work on Barauani fertiliser plant project had been completed till February 28. The plant is being developed on 480 acres of land of Hindustan Fertilisers and Chemicals Limited by Hindustan Urvarak and Rasayan Limited. It will produce 12 lakh metric tonnes of urea per year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gadkari-delay-in-widening-of-nh-83-due-to-lack-of-land/articleshow/81517559.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Name one thing you have done for people: Sukhbir Singh Badal to Amarinder Singh||AMARKOT (TARN TARAN): SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday slammed chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh for fooling people with false promises to gain power. He listed development work done under the Akali regime and assured a second wave of development if voted to power. Addressing the second “Punjab mange jawab” rally, he asked Amarinder to tell why he “played with sentiments of Punjabis,” and asked him to name “one thing he had done for the people over the past four years.” “Tell us one road, power grid or college you have made,” he questioned. He also took on the CM over the alleged “false oath on Gutka Sahib” and the promise of waiver of farmers’ loans. “Punjabis want answers for the fraud committed on them by the chief minister who, while promising jobs to youth, also got forms signed from them and issued affidavits promising the same,” he alleged. Sukhbir claimed that the CM had neglected the state and made development a distant dream. He cited the example of the poor state of Virasat-e-Marg in Amritsar and said that the law and order situation had deteriorated. He also said government machinery was being allegedly used to give clean chits to corrupt leaders and legislators allegedly “running their own mafias.” Reminding Amarinder of the promise made to farmers, he alleged that the promised compensation of Rs 10,000 per acre to farmers having land beyond the barbed fence at the international border was not being paid. The SAD, he claimed, had always lived up to the expectations of people of Punjab. “This is because we satisfy regional aspirations of people unlike the Congress and BJP, which look up to their Central command for directions,” he said. Speaking on the occasion, former cabinet minister Bikram Singh Majithia alleged that Congress leaders in Khemkaran had threatened to lodge cases against those attempting to attend the Punjab mange jawab rally. Gulzar Singh Ranike, Harmeet Singh Sandhu, Bhai Manjit Singh, Gaurav Valtoha, Gurpartap Tikka, Talbir Gill, Iqbal Sandhu and Manjit Ghasitpura also addressed the rally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/name-one-thing-you-have-done-for-people-sukhbir-to-capt/articleshow/81519449.cms||Yudhvir Rana

By the end of 2022, L’Oreal brand Garnier’s packaging in India will display labelling to reveal its environmental and social impact. In France, L’Oreal is currently testing this on its haircare products, wherein the labelling provides a sustainability score from A to E (A being the best). The score takes into account 14 environmental factors from sourcing, manufacture, transportation, usage to recyclability, and the data is verified by an independent auditor. L’Oreal claims Garnier is the first brand to do this. L’Oreal India’s consumer products division director Pankaj Sharma told TOI, “Sustainability as a parameter on which consumers make a purchasing decision is on the rise. Safety and quality are the top criteria and price is embedded in the positioning. Between brand and sustainability, there would be a correlation.” Sharma added, “We have picked Garnier first for such an initiative because it sells the maximum number of units. Work is in progress across other brands.” In India, L’Oreal is a leader in the men’s range, while it is among the top two in the hair colour category. While Garnier has launched the ‘Green Beauty’ initiative, Unilever has globally said it will drop the word ‘normal’ across all its beauty and personal care brands’ packaging and advertising. This is part of its ‘Positive Beauty’ vision and strategy. Recently, Unilever said the trend is clear — two in three people in India (65%) say they now pay more attention to a company’s stance on societal issues before they buy products than they used to. Six in 10 people (63%) will not buy a product if they do not agree with the company’s vision of diversity and inclusion, even if it offers the best price. Brand strategy specialist Harish Bijoor said, “We live in a choice generation. Environmental and social consciousness falls in this space. When one brand sets its standards higher than the others, the first brand sets a nudge in motion. All other brands suffer the angst of FOMO (fear of missing out) and follow.” Globally, Garnier has set a target to be zero-virgin plastic in all packaging by 2025, with all of it either reusable, recyclable or compostable. Garnier has also been certified by Cruelty Free International for its commitment against animal testing. “The pandemic was a wakeup call for all businesses to protect the planet, making sustainable beauty accessible to what we have endeavoured to do and we would like to lead the change,” said Sharma. He added that the company’s factories in India would be carbon-neutral by the end of the year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/garnier-labels-to-show-environmental-impact/articleshow/81519688.cms||---
---||Business||PSU banks’ NPAs fall Rs 1 lakh crore in FY21||MUMBAI: Non-performing assets (NPAs) of public sector banks fell by over Rs 1 lakh crore during the first nine months of the current fiscal to Rs 5,77,137 crore from Rs 6,78,317 crore. Responding to a Parliament query, the government said that the reduction was due to its strategy of “recognition, resolution, recapitalisation and reforms”. The government said that its policy of transparent recognition of NPAs resulted in bad loans rising to a high of Rs 8,95,601 crore in FY18 from Rs 2,79,016 crore in FY15. According to the data, UCO Bank has seen the sharpest reduction of 40.7% in its NPA numbers in December 2020 from March 2020. This was followed by Bank of Maharashtra (33.6%), State Bank of India (21.4%) and Canara Bank (18.6%). In its response, the government said that until September 2020, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code had led to the approval of 277 resolution plans with Rs 1.9 lakh crore of the realisable amount by financial creditors. It said that the government has infused Rs 3.2 lakh crore in public sector banks in the last six years, with the banks themselves raising Rs 2.8 lakh crore through equity and bonds. Banks also raised an additional Rs 36,226 crore by selling non-core assets. On the projection in the Reserve Bank of India’s financial stability report that bank NPAs could rise to 13.5% by September 2021, the finance ministry said that according to the central bank, the numbers do not factor in the policy measures. These include RBI’s resolution framework for Covid-related stress and one-time restructuring of loans. In response to another query, the government said that 127 cases of fraud were assigned to the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. These pertained to 1,161 companies. Of these, 26 cases pertaining to 326 companies were reported in FY20. There were also 3,431 convictions and Rs 17.3-crore fine imposed during the last five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/psu-banks-npas-fall-rs-1l-cr-in-fy21/articleshow/81519615.cms||---

---||Delhi||DU teachers hold march in protest over college dues||New Delhi: Opposing the new “Pattern of Assistance” proposed by the Delhi government, members of Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) on Monday marched from the vice-chancellor’s office to the chief minister’s residence. They raised slogans against the Delhi government and demanded that the issue of pending salaries in DU colleges should be discussed by the university in its executive council (EC) meeting on March 18. Several DU teachers gathered outside the office of acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi to join the ‘Adhikaar Rally’ to protest against the Delhi government’s “arbitrary and unreasonable stance towards the 12 fully funded colleges maintained by it.” For more than a year now, employees have not been paid salaries and pensions on time, they claimed. Despite attempts, TOI failed to get a response from the government on this. Calling “Pattern of Assistance” a “dubious document”, DUTA members also opposed the government for creating a division, which has given additional charge of the colleges to senior officials, claiming that they would be replacing principals. “These are clearly attempts to divert attention to extraneous issues and to mislead the public from the real issue of its attempt to wriggle out of its responsibility towards these public institutions and push them towards commercialisation,” DUTA alleged while submitting a memorandum to the CM. A delegation of DUTA and Delhi University Principals’ Association also met the acting VC and dean (colleges), requesting them to ask the government to withdraw the document. Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers’ Association members, meanwhile, supported their demands and claimed that teachers were getting harassed. In a letter to Joshi, EC members Seema Das and JL Gupta informed him that they had written to him protesting the appointment of officers with additional charges for 12 Delhi government colleges. “They will vitiate their autonomy, which is required for dissemination of quality education. This will lead to a problematic situation where multiple agencies will end up appointing their own ‘resident commissioners’, to which DU must not be a mute spectator,” they wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-teachers-hold-march-in-protest-over-college-dues/articleshow/81519458.cms||---

---||Patna||Minister: Centre has OK’d jetties in Saran, Bhagalpur||PATNA: The state industries minister, Syed Shahnawaz Hussain, said on Monday that the ministry of ports, shipping and waterways has given its consent for the construction of a jetty at Balughat in Saran district and another at Bhagalpur district. Cargo terminals will also come up at both places. The industries minister also said two information technology (IT) parks will be set up in Bihta (25 acres) and Rajgir (125 acres) to develop the sector in the state. He also claimed that a textile park would come up at Kumarbagh at Bettiah in West Champaran district. He added that land is being identified at Wazirganj in Gaya for extension of the power loom industries in the district. Shahnawaz made the announcements while inaugurating the second business incubator centre of Bihar Industries Association here on Monday. He also addressed 'a dialogue for enterprising Bihar' organised by the BIA. "Priority to agro-based industries will be given in industrial land allotment by the Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority (BIADA)," Shahnawaz said. He added, "Priority-based felicitation and support to the state entrepreneurs over others will be guaranteed. All BIADA-related issues such as exit policy, transfer policy and terms of the lease will be sorted out within a week." The industries minister also claimed that Bihar will be the first state to formulate a policy to promote ethanol production. "Ethanol production will boost sugarcane farming, attract investors, thus generate employment in the state," he said. During the discussion, entrepreneurs from across the state and various industries such as steel, food processing, dairy, sugar, petrochemical, manufacturing and others put forth various grievances and suggestions. Sanjay Goenka, the former BIA vice-president, pointed out the problem of Bihar Industrial Investment Policy 2016, which demands a 100% down payment for registration of industrial land as opposed to the 2011 investment policy, which asked for a 30% down payment followed by the fulfilment of rest of the amount in seven instalments. "Without registration, the banks do not release the loan, demanding 100% as the down payment for registration of land is unjust and impractical," he said. BIA president Ram Lal Khaitan said other than scarcity and allotment issues of industrial land, higher rates are also an area of concern for most industrialists. "The rate of land at Patliputra industrial area is skyrocketing. Proper consideration and revision in rates of land are suggested." Shahnawaz said a decision in this regard will be announced by the weekend after deliberation and discussion with BIADA authorities. The minister also announced that within 100 working days BIADA's basic infrastructure in Patna, Hajipur, Bhagalpur and Muzaffarpur will be developed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minister-centre-has-okd-jetties-in-saran-bhagalpur/articleshow/81517922.cms||---
---||Business||Diversity now a priority even for fresher hiring||Chennai: Diversity, which is important for India Inc to achieve in lateral roles and leadership positions, is now finding a place in campus hiring drives as well. Companies including Intel, Cognizant, Accenture, Capgemini, PayPal, and others are sensitizing their hiring managers and stressing on diversity of gender and sexual orientation while hiring from campuses for both full-time roles and internships. Those with ‘special needs’ is another key segment they look to hire.While merit and performance remain key criteria in assessments, companies said hiring managers are judged on the extent of diversity they bring with respect to women, people with special needs, and LGBTQ candidates. “Out of all our diversity targets, 30%-40% comes from college hiring. So it is very important to have a good mix in our talent pool Both campus hiring and internship programs focus strongly on diversity. We are educating hiring managers to look at diversity,” Anjali Rao, head of HR and senior director, HR, Intel India, said. “ Now the focus is particularly on college hiring and we have asked them to add — gender and diversity lens — to the recruitment programs,” she added. Bengaluru-based placements firm Pride Circle, which helps enrol people from across the LGBTQIA+ spectrum, says companies are now doing advocacy work in campuses, which is important since the community faces bullying and discrimination regularly. “For example Godrej has been talking about it a lot externally. Companies like Accenture and Natwest offer internships for trans people and software consultancy ThoughtWorks has a six-month internship program for all LGBTQIA+ candidates,” Ram Sinha, co-founder, Pride Circle, said.Capgemini, with 1.25 lakh employees in India, emphasizes formation of diverse panels during interviews with a woman leader among them. All panelists also undergo training on interviewing biases to acknowledge and address their issues, and interventions are made where necessary. “We tie up with not only the colleges in tier-A cities but also focus on bringing in people from tier-C and D cities and women,” Niraj Parihar, executive VP, leader of insights and data global business at Capgemini India, said. Capgemini’s OUTfront Ally Group Network -- a forum for LGBTIA+ employees -- also supports them with insurance benefits for same-sex partners and gender affirmation surgery. IT major Cognizant also achieves gender diversity at junior levels by consciously inviting institutes that promote it. “For example, one-third of the colleges identified for Cognizant’s Digital Nurture programme, which involves building a candidate pool by providing skill development and internship opportunities, are women-only institutes,” Maya Sreekumar, vice president of human resources, and India head for campus hiring, Cognizant, said. “At this point, nearly half of the candidates from the 2021 graduating batch who have been offered jobs are female,” she added. Women form around 38% of the company’s overall workforce in India and this goes to nearly 45% of their workforce from tier-2 cities. Intel says its focus is to promote women candidates in tech roles. PayPal says it has more than doubled the number of women in leadership since 2010, and currently nearly half of their global workforce (42%) are women. While the company recently launched a training and mentorship program for 500 women students from across leading engineering colleges in India called the Unity Bloom initiative, it also has a ‘Girls in Tech’ to give young girls a hands-on experience and understanding of technology at early stages. A placement official from a large Chennai-based engineering college said besides regular campus placement drives, companies are in recent years also separately conducting diversity hiring fairs at institutes to hire women, those with special needs, and those who identify as LGBTQ.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/diversity-now-a-priority-even-for-fresher-hiring/articleshow/81518407.cms||---
---||Kolkata||IIT-Kgp set to call UG students to campus||Kolkata: First-year students who took admission in the UG programmes in the 2020-2021 academic session will set foot on the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, campus for the first time this summer. They had not been able to attend in-person classes due to the pandemic. Along with them, some final-year students will also be called back. “The first-year UG pupils will be among the first set of students who, along with some final-year candidates, will be called back in Kharagpur for in-person classes,” said Tamal Nath, the registrar of the institute. He added that the final year students will be allowed to return to attend the pending laboratory lessons. Director V K Tewari on Monday informed that, at present, the institute has 400 research scholars on campus who were quarantined on their return. “We have plans to bring back more students. The matter was recently discussed with the student senate. We have slowly started the activities at the Gymkhana and are doing the needful to gear up to resume sporting activities. By May-June, we hope to call back the final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students so that they are able to complete their lab classes. By July, we hope to recall 50%-60% of the students with due consideration to the SOPs and quarantine protocols,” Tewari said. Senior administrative officials of IIT-Kharagpur pointed out that the institute had planned to invite students back to the campus when the Covid situation was seemingly looking better for the country. “However, the cases reported in Chennai deterred our plans. We also had to consider the students coming from all over India, including Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, where a large number of cases are still being reported. This cautious approach is particularly due to the limitations in clinical facilities in the region — the nearest facilities are in Kolkata, which would take about three hours to reach. Following the advice from the ministry of education and the SOPs by the ministry of home affairs, we have been calling back the research scholars in batches,” Tewari said. The registrar added that 5,800 of the 15,000 enrolled students will be brought back to the Kharagpur campus in summer. The institute has around 50 departments, centres and schools spread over the 2,100-acre campus. Sources in the institute said that over the past few months, several students have written to the authorities, seeking permission to return to campus. “There are admitted students who do not have adequate online facilities in their hometowns. Moreover, online classes can’t replace in-person lessons. Several students have approached their respective departments from time to time with requests to be brought back to the campus, which would allow them hassle-free access to online classes. But they have also alleged that no clear resolution has been put forward for the students. Hopefully, the decision to gradually bring back the students in phases will normalize the situation,” a teacher said. It will later be decided whether students who find a seat in IIT-Kharagpur in August 2021 will be allowed on campus from the first day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iit-kgp-set-to-call-ug-students-to-campus/articleshow/81519044.cms||Somdatta Basu

Sahani also said identification, listing and enrolment of 94.59 lakh people for benefits under the social security schemes marks a phenomenal increase in the last 15 years as the number of beneficiaries of the pension schemes during the 2007-08 financial year was only 12.30 lakh. Sahani said this after Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha asked him to state the achievements of the social welfare department under the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government. It came ahead of building construction department minister Ashok Choudhary's reply to the House debate on his own department’s budgetary demand of Rs 5,321.40 crore for 2021-22 fiscal. Later, the building construction department budget was passed by voice vote, while the opposition members staged a walkout. Sahani added that as many as 25 lakh people above 60, cutting across castes and communities, are also getting monthly pensionary benefits under Mukhyamantri Briddhajan Yojana (MBY). Those covered by MBY are those who have not been getting any centrally sponsored pension scheme. “The money is being transferred into the personal accounts of the beneficiaries through the direct benefit transfer (DBT) method,” Sahani said. In the last one and half months, the social welfare department did the leg work and is now ready to open 139 Ashraya Sthals (shelter homes) in different parts of the state for the old, physically challenged persons and also others, Sahani said. For his part, the building construction department minister said work is on to complete the construction of engineering colleges to comply with the Saat Nishchay programme under which 31 such colleges are to be opened in the state. While construction work on four engineering college at Bakhtiyarpur (Patna), Supaul, Jamui and Banka is already over, nine other colleges at Saharsa, Sasaram, Sitamarhi, Madhepura, Gopalganj, Araria, Kaimur, Begusarai and Purnia will be completed this year, Choudhary said. He added that work on 13 other engineering colleges will be completed by December this year. “Utmost attention is being paid to delivering quality work in construction under the aegis of the department,” Choudhary said, adding that all this was the result of the “vision and planning” of CM Nitish Kumar, who had also set a milestone in undertaking welfare work for the uplift of the scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and other weaker sections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/94l-brought-under-social-security-net-welfare-minister/articleshow/81517778.cms||Abhay Singh

It instead asked the opposition to speak on it during the House debate on the budgetary demand of the home department on Tuesday. The government side, represented before the Speaker by deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary and minister Shrawan Kumar, maintained that the imposition of prohibition in the state had now largely become policing affair, and, therefore, it would be proper to discuss the related matters during the House debate on the budgetary demand of the home department. Last Wednesday, the opposition led by Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had demanded special discussion on prohibition and CM Nitish Kumar’s reply to it. The Speaker had then said that he would give his ruling on their demand at a meeting of the legislature party leaders of all the political parties on Monday. Those from opposition who participated in the meeting convened by the Speaker in his chamber on Monday were Tejashwi and Lalit Kumar Yadav from the RJD, Ajeet Sharma from the Congress, Mahboob Alam from the CPI(ML), Akhtarul Iman from the AIMIM. Former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi also attended the meeting. During the question hour in the assembly on Monday, deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad took strong exception to the unbecoming remark made by Tejashwi on the “unconvincing” reply given by sugar cane minister Pramod Kumar to a short-notice question from him. After CPI(ML) member Mahboob Alam raised the issue of suicide by five members of a family in Supaul district in the face of starvation, the Speaker asked Tarkishore to take note of it and do the needful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/opposition-to-corner-govt-on-prohibition-issue-today/articleshow/81517733.cms||Abhay Singh

Indeed, it was crucial for the YSRC to register a victory in the TDP bastion of GVMC, not only to defeat its primary opposition but to execute its plan to set up the executive capital in Vizag. Of the 98 wards in GVMC, the YSRC won 58, TDP secured 30, Jana Sena 3, independent candidates 4 and BJP, CPI(M) and CPI one each. But even as the YSRC has made inroads into areas in Vizag city where sitting MLAs are from TDP, the opposition has also won wards in some assembly constituencies where the MLAs are from YSRC. In Visakha East led by TDP MLA Velagapudi Ramakrishna Babu, YSRC won 10 of 15 wards while TDP could manage only three. Similarly, in Visakha West, YSRC won 10 of 14 wards and the TDP, four. The ruling party continued its winning streak in Visakha North by securing 15 of 17 wards. Under Gajuwaka assembly constituency where the sitting MLA is Tippla Nagi Reddy from YSRC, the YSRC secured nine wards with the TDP following close behind with eight wards.

This comes two days after the opposition created a ruckus in the assembly over the seizure of several cartons of illicit liquor from a school owned by the brother of a cabinet minister. The RJD-led opposition also marched to the Raj Bhawan seeking the dismissal of the government. Monday's review meeting was the fourth by the CM in the past two months over enforcement of the liquor ban. Chairing the high-level meeting at ‘Sankalp’ hall at the CM residence, Nitish asked the police and prohibition & excise department officials to ensure strict enforcement of prohibition law and directed them to act tough against all violators. “You must ensure that no people involved in the illegal trade of liquor could escape the long hand of the law,” the CM told the officials. Nitish asked officials to keep a special vigil on all activities of known liquor mafias who came out of prison after spending some time in judicial custody for violation of prohibition law. Nitish, who had ordered a complete ban on the sale and consumption of alcohol across the state nearly five years ago, also called for a wide-ranging awareness programme among the masses about the ill-effects of liquor. “Liquor consumption is a very bad thing,” it should be popularized among common people through different government agencies. “Use different platforms of social media to make people aware of the ill effects of alcohol,” he said. The CM further asked the officials to launch a special drive to nab the big liquor traders of the big cities. “The superintendents of police (SPs) will keep a close watch and take swift action against the liquor traders identified at the district level,” Nitish said. He also asked officials to ensure the functioning of the anti-liquor call centre at the state headquarters and ensure quick action on getting information about any illicit trade of liquor. “The name and identity of the persons providing information at the call centre, are kept secret and not disclosed to anyone,” Nitish said at the review meeting. Nitish further said that the World Health Organization (WHO) had published a report in 2018 in which it had enumerated a number of diseases that result from drinking. Holding a similar review meeting on February 15, the CM had said that if police personnel is caught drinking liquor in dry Bihar, he/ she would be dismissed from the job immediately. “We are taking strict disciplinary action against the government officials and employees if they are found violating the prohibition laws,” a senior police officer, who did not want to be identified, told TOI on Monday. He said around 620 employees and officials were facing departmental action for violating prohibition laws. “FIRs have been lodged against around 350 employees, while 186 personnel have been dismissed from the service,” he said. DGP S K Singhal told the CM at the meeting that illicit liquor is being recovered from almost all districts. “Recently, big godowns were sealed. Several big traders of illicit liquors, some of them from outside the state, were also arrested. Special drives to nab the violators are being carried out in both urban and rural areas,” Singhal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-tells-officials-to-spare-no-one-involved-in-liquor-trade/articleshow/81518170.cms||Madan Kumar

The mother of the children, Shahzada Bano (30), survived with serious burn injuries received during her attempts to rescue her children and husband, who were trapped in the flames. She has been admitted to MJM hospital at Kishanganj. The tragedy struck the family around 3 am when Noor Alam (35) along with his wife Shahzada Bano, two daughters and two sons were asleep in their house. A fire suddenly engulfed the house causing an explosion of LPG cylinders, which intensified the flames. While Noor Alam, his two daughters--Tauhfa Parveen (10), Shabnam Parveen alias Babli (08) and two sons--Rahmat Raza (06) and Md. Shahid (03) died on the spot, his wife suffered serious burn injuries and is battling for life in the hospital. Kishanganj SDPO Anwar Javed Ansari said four other houses were also damaged due to the fire. Fire personnel fought for an hour to douse the flames. However, the house belonging to Noor Alam was reduced to ashes. According to eyewitness accounts, the tremor of the cylinder blast was felt in a radius of about one km in the area. A large number of people rushed to the spot after the explosion. Kishanganj SP Ashish Bharti said that the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. The bodies were sent to the hospital for post mortem. "The post mortem report is awaited," he added. Meanwhile, the district administration announced to provide Rs.4 lakh as ex gratia to the deceased's family. A sum of Rs.98,000 has been provided for the last rites. Also, foodgrains and polythene sheets have been given to the affected families. Kishanganj subdivisional officer Shahnawaz Ahmad Niyazi said that a proposal for compensation to the deceased's family will be submitted to the headquarters soon, he added. Earlier, four people were killed in a similar cylinder explosion at Bakhri Tola village under the Kuchaykot police station in Gopalganj district in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/4-kids-among-5-of-family-killed-in-kishanganj-cylinder-blast/articleshow/81518218.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Bihar: Private operators hike bus fares by 20%||PATNA: Private bus operators increased fares on interdistrict and interstate routes by up to 20% on Monday citing rise in fuel prices and the crisis caused by Covid-19 pandemic. Petrol was sold at Rs 93.64 and diesel at Rs 87.16 per litre in different parts of the state on Monday. The private bus operators have increased fares without proper permission from the competent authorities. Bihar Motor Transport Federation (BMTF) had recently written to CM Nitish Kumar and transport minister Sheela Kumari, seeking permission to increase bus fares. However, the transport department has so far not taken any decision in this regard. BMTF president Uday Shanker Singh said it was mentioned in the letter that the bus fares would be increased from March 15. “Rise in prices of petrol and diesel and Covid pandemic have made it difficult for private operators to sustain. They are not in a position to pay their drivers, conductors and cleaners. Increasing bus fares was the only option,” Singh said. He added at least 250 private companies operate 60,000 buses in the state. “All these operators are facing losses. Their expenses have increased as buses have to be sanitised after each trip. Considering all these factors, we decided to increase fares of all categories of buses on different routes,” Singh said. Fares of ordinary and express buses have increased by 90 and 95 paise per kilometre, respectively. Passengers of deluxe and semi-deluxe buses will now have to pay 136 and 114 paise more per kilometre. Fares of deluxe AC buses and super premium buses have been increased by 150 and 200 paise per kilometre, respectively. Mukesh Sharma, a private operator who runs 20 buses and has employed around 60 people, said, “As prices of fuel and essential commodities have gone up, we had no other option but to increase fares. In fact, the fares have been revised after a long gap,” he added. Meanwhile, the rise in bus fares ahead of Holi has troubled commuters. Suraj Kumar, a vendor and resident of Agamkuan, said, “We depend on buses while commuting. The hike in fare will add to our woes.” Aditi Kumari, a college student, echoed Kumar’s tone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/private-operators-hike-bus-fares-by-20/articleshow/81517548.cms||Faryal Rumi

The speaker had earlier asked Chudasama not to wear casual wear in the house. Even as Trivedi asked Vimal Chudasama to leave the house, wear formal attire and return, the Somnath MLA continued to protest in the house, prompting the speaker to direct sergeants to evict him. While BJP MLAs demanded that Chudasama be suspended from the assembly, Congress MLAs vociferously backed their colleague and opposed the speaker’s decision. Pradipsinh Jadeja, minister of state for home, moved a resolution for suspension of the MLA, even as Vimal Chudasama refused to leave the assembly and kept repeating that his clothes were not inappropriate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mla-evicted-from-guj-assembly-for-wearing-t-shirt/articleshow/81519514.cms||---

The policy, which is applicable for employees with children aged from 6 months to 4 years, also includes those who have taken the adoption or surrogacy route to parenting. The pandemic has been a challenging time, especially for those who’ve recently entered parenthood. With daycares not fully functional, managing work along with home and childcare became tough. No other company has separately announced a policy to pay employees specifically for nanny services. Mondelez India HR director Mahalakshmi R told TOI, “Managing work from home (WFH) for new parents is a tough task, given that creches are not open at every location. We have expanded the ‘creche benefit’ under our ‘new parents policy’ to include ‘in-house nanny services’ till such time that creches around India are operational again. This will provide greater flexibility to our colleagues in managing parenting and work.” Hiring an in-house nanny can cost Rs 12,000-15,000 per month. ProEves co-founder Divya Agarwal said some daycares that are not currently operational are providing nanny care and teachers at home. They provide this service through their network of trained nannies and teachers to support parents. Given that many companies are adopting a hybrid work model, people on WFH prefer to avail of creche services closer to their homes. According to ProEves — which is a leading childcare aggregator and provider of virtual care, learning & parental support benefits — most companies are geared to provide near-home creche support and they plan to communicate the same to their employees by April this year. ‘Virtual Care’, on the other hand, is also expected to continue through 2021 as part of daycare services option. A study by ProEves indicates that 53% of the companies are extending near-home/pan-city daycare to provide benefits to WFH employees. This is higher than the 28% companies that preferred near-home daycare a year ago (December 2019-January 2020). “With hybrid working models, companies are providing creche benefit to WFH employees by way of partnering with aggregator/multiple daycare partners. Draft rules of social security code are also endorsing this. So, we expect ‘creche from anywhere’ will be the much-needed benefit for ‘work-from-anywhere’ parents,” said Agarwal. DBS India head of rewards Navin Chaudhary said, during the lockdown and accompanying Covid-ridden months, the firm observed that parents were not keen on enrolling their children in any daycare format (on-site/near home).  “While our on-site daycares are not operational currently, the near-home daycares are activated to support parents. However, parents are still hesitant to house their children in daycare facilities and the uptake has been rather muted,” said Chaudhary. To support working mothers, DBS India has two on-site daycare centres and tie-ups with daycare brands across cities that it is present in. With hybrid work regimes becoming the norm, DBS believes that for daycare benefit to be meaningful, there should be increased flexibility to choose office/near-home daycare according to employees’ convenience. “From the onset, our daycare policy is the hybrid of on-site and near-home/pan-city model. We are able to cater to varied preferences that working mothers might have. As employees are increasingly adopting a part-remote working and part-office working format, freedom to explore both daycare formats and not being restricted to one day-care centre enrollment will be a true differentiator,” said Chaudhary. Pre-pandemic, several progressive companies paid fully or partly for the cost incurred by employees on creches. Some even bore the cost of an accompanying nanny when new mothers went on official tours along with their children up to a certain age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mondelez-to-foot-bill-for-in-house-nanny/articleshow/81519521.cms||Namrata Singh

While in the rest of the country, there has been no opposition to taking up uranium mining, Telangana perhaps is the only place where it has been objected to. “We have suspended uranium exploration work in Telangana. There has been opposition from the public and the government too has asked that there be no further work on the project,” AMD director DK Sinha said on Monday. He said people without having knowledge had even written books and circulated them, misleading people and saying that uranium mining would be dangerous. “If it takes five years or 10 years for people to realise that it is safe, we will wait,” he said about the opposition that came up in Lambapur and Peddagattu villages in Nalgonda district when the Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) wanted to take up exploration. Some 20,000 to 30,000 tonnes of uranium deposits were estimated to be present underground in the region near Nagarjunasagar. “There is cooperation from people and state government practically almost everywhere in the country as we have taken up exploration in several states but in Telangana it is a different story,” Sinha said. UCIL general manager for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, M S Rao, said the present uranium mining project in Tummalapalli in Kadapa in AP would also be expanded. In addition, work would be taken up for another project at Kanampalli. He said the existing Tummapalli project has a capacity for nine lakh tonnes per annum for mining and the plan was to expand it to 13.5 lakh tonnes per annum. This would have been taken up at a cost of Rs 700 crore but for a PIL that was filed against it when the public hearing was to take place on January 6. MS Rao said the high court had vacated the PIL on February 16 giving UCIL three months time to conduct a public hearing. “Once the public hearing is successful, we will expand the plant,” he said. For exploration work at Kanampalli deposits, local authorities of YSR Kadapa district have been approached.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uranium-mining-is-safe-oppn-only-in-t-experts/articleshow/81518010.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The Rs 42 crore work which the selected agency would need to complete within 12 months is expected to start after the elections. KMDA officials said that the ROB will get a completely new set of massive steel frame support to hold up the existing dilapidated structure. The bridge will have three new steel pillars in between each of two existing pillars to give additional support. “It would be another structural steel made permanent support system that would hold up the existing bridge structure by fixing steel props on the columns from below. There will be three new steel made piers between the existing piers and a plate will be fixed on the deck. It would not look good to see from below, but this is required to keep the existing structure intact,” said a bridge expert. ROB will remain open for traffic during repair work. “The repair work will be conducted in such a way that there would not be any requirement to shut the bridge. Only occasionally one lane or some portion might be closed for about 30 minutes to an hour as per requirement,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/baghajatin-rob-to-get-new-steel-frame-after-elections/articleshow/81518030.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Mumbai||Ambani security scare: Maharashtra govt suspends Sachin Waze; NIA says SUV not stolen, was at his home||MUMBAI: As the state government on Monday suspended arrested police officer Sachin Waze—his second suspension after the first one in March 2004 in connection with the custodial death of bomb blast accused Khwaja Yunus—sources told TOI the NIA has found that the explosives-laden Scorpio found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25 was not stolen, as alleged by Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, but was parked at Waze’s housing society in Thane. Waze has reportedly admitted to his role but not disclosed the motive, sources close to the investigation said. Hiran, who had the vehicle in his possession, had told the media that the SUV was stolen on February 17 from Mulund-Airoli Road where he had parked after it developed a technical snag. The NIA probe has shown that “someone” opened the car with its key, drove it and parked it in assistant police inspector Waze’s housing society Saket in Thane. Later, the vehicle was later found near Ambani’s residence. Sources said Waze had collected the digital video recorder containing CCTV images from his housing society, which the NIA claims has been damaged. Sources said it has also emerged that Waze visited a shop that makes number plates and took away all digital evidence containing details of visitors and the register containing orders received. It is alleged that the number plate of the Scorpio belonged to a scooter. The shop is located opposite Hiran’s car accessories shop.Hiran on February 18 lodged an FIR with the Vikhroli police alleging that while he was heading to Opera House, there was a snag in the Scorpio, so he parked the vehicle on the Eastern Express Highway and took an Ola cab to Crawford Market. The Ola driver gave a statement to the state Anti-Terrorism Squad, which is probing Hiran’s murder, that Hiran later changed his destination and went to meet someone whom he was referring to as “Sir” near CST. Investigators suspect that on Waze’s behalf, Hiran then allegedly handed over the Scorpio’s key to this “Sir”, who in turn took the car and parked it in Waze’s housing society. The Scorpio was lying in Waze’s housing society for nearly a week before it was found abandoned, laden with gelatin sticks, outside Antilia at Carmichael Road on February 25. There was also a threatening letter addressed to the Ambanis. “Hiran was under pressure from Waze to lodge a false complaint with the Vikhroli police,” sources said. To ensure that the crucial evidence does not reach other investigating agencies conducting a parallel probe into the bomb scare, Waze gave a letter to his society on March 2 and took away the DVR in the name of investigation. Waze was part of the crime intelligence unit (CIU) that initially probed the case. A resident of the society confirmed that Waze had taken the DVR but declined to elaborate. The NIA, which has taken over the DVR, said it has been damaged. “If we get the footage it will be of great help to establish the fact that Waze orchestrated the terror scare outside Ambani’s house. We are trying to retrieve data from the DVR,” said an official. Waze has reportedly admitted to his role but not disclosed the motive, sources said. The NIA in its remand application stated that Waze was part of a big conspiracy involving many others. Police on Tuesday questioned API Riyazuddin Kazi and S Howald for the second day. They were questioned about the fake number plates found inside the Scorpio and Innova, being used by the CIU. The Innova was tailing the Scorpio. The occupant of the Scorpio got down and left in the Innova.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-suspends-waze-nia-says-suv-not-stolen-was-at-his-home/articleshow/81521500.cms||Ahmed Ali

As a result, the ice cream parlour owners find themselves sitting on over a week of stock with mounting overheads. Baskins Robbins franchisee Nitin Kukreja said it’s unfair that the same product is banned for some, while operational for others. “We are seeking permission only for online delivery as has been approved for restaurants. If they can deliver ice cream through online orders, why can’t we,” Kukreja said. Before the implementation of the restrictions, Kukreja on Friday met city police commissioner, as part of a larger traders’ delegation, in which the issue of ice cream parlours was also raised. Kukreja said, “The police officers were convinced and said that there was no reason why ice cream parlours couldn’t accept orders online. Based on this, many of us stockpiled inventory in anticipation of the restrictions getting extended.” “Almost all of us filled up inventory to the maximum capacity as apart from extension of restrictions, even the demand might go up due to people being at home. But on Sunday we came to know that Nagpur Municipal Corporation has denied permission for online sale,” Kukreja said. Top N Town ice cream parlour owner Rakesh Manjani said he is stuck with heavy overheads. “Those freezers are power-guzzling gadgets and now we can’t even shut them off because of the inventory in it. So, my power bills continue to rise but income stops,” Manjani said. Apart from them, other groups too appealed to policemen and civic authorities for keeping their shops and business open. Police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said, “We are open to receiving memorandums from traders and discussing their issues. But if they come on streets and violate guidelines, action will be taken.” On Monday, members of Prahaar Vaahan Chaalak Sanghathan took the streets and displayed banners against restrictions. Organization’s president Rajesh Bodhare said, “Let the government first pay for our EMIs, insurance and taxes after which they can continue with the lockdown.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ice-cream-parlours-told-to-shut-down-during-lockdown-cry-foul/articleshow/81518026.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Lucknow||Keep 2015 as base year to fix UP panchayat election quota, says Allahabad high court||LUCKNOW: A Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court on Monday directed the state government and the state election commission to finalize the reservation of seats by adopting 2015 as the base year in the forthcoming three-tier Panchayat elections in Uttar Pradesh. The court also extended the deadline to complete the whole election process by May 25, 2021. Passing the order, a division bench of Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Manish Mathur also quashed the state government’s notification of February 11, 2021 through which it had announced the recent elections, holding that the notification provided reservation exceeding 50%, which cannot be permitted in law. The bench passed the order on a PIL filed by one Ajai Kumar challenging the February 11, 2021 notification and seeking 2015 as the base year for calculation of reservation on the seats. The government, in its notification, had kept 1995 as the base year for reservation. Earlier, During course of hearing on Monday, Advocate General Raghvendra Singh apprised the bench that the government had no objection in taking 2015 as the base year for calculating the reservation on seats . He also did not object to setting aside of the February 11, 2021 notification. The petitioner’s lawyer Mohammad Altaf Mansoor had argued that the February 11, 2021 notification provided reservation on the seats which exceeded 50% in contravention of the directions of the apex court and as such the same are liable to be quashed. After conceding to adopt 2015 as the base year, AG Raghvendra Singh and commission’s lawyer Anurag Singh informed the bench that Allahabad high court on February 4, 2021 directed for finalizing the whole election process by May 15, 2021 but in view of the fresh exercise to be taken up following the Monday’s order, some more time would be required. Considering the need , the bench gave a ten-day extension by fixing May 25 to be the fresh deadline for completing the election process. In the PIL, the petitioner had pleaded that UP Panchayat Raj (Reservation and Allotment of Seats and Offices ) Rules 1994 provided 1995 as base for providing reservation on seats and state government issued a notification on September 16, 2015 which set 2015 as the base year on the basis of demographic situations and accordingly 2015 Panchayat elections were held keeping 2015 as the base year. But, the government decided to follow 1995 as the base year in 2021 election without while the demographic situation of September 16, 2015 was still in existence, the PIL said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/keep-2015-as-base-year-to-fix-panchayat-poll-quota-says-hc/articleshow/81521005.cms||---

The student of Delhi University’s Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College had heard many horror stories about the open-book exam, but he himself had a nice experience. “I could easily download the question paper. After finishing, I made a PDF and uploaded it,” said Negi, who appeared for environmental science exam. The dean of examination, D S Rawat, said the personalised detailed emails on the dos and don’ts and an active network of nodal officers in colleges had helped in smooth conducting of the exam. Some students of School of Open Learning (SOL), however, faced problems while receiving the question paper. Almost 100% of the 85,000 regular students, along with SOL candidates, are appearing online as nobody has opted for the physical mode this time. Students had faced a lot of problems during the first open-book exam last August. The second exam in December was better, but some problems still existed. “This time, there was no issue; students said everything was smooth,” said Kumar Ashutosh, examination deputy superintendent at College of Vocational Studies. “I did not face any problem. The question paper had come on time and I could easily download it,” said Raunak Thakur of Motilal Nehru College. The students also have the option of emailing the answer script. “If they can’t upload even after the four hours due to poor internet connection, they can email it, but will have to produce documentary evidence. However, I explained that emailing answer scripts could delay the evaluation process,” Rawat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/glitches-rectified-du-students-report-better-open-book-experience/articleshow/81519471.cms||Shradha Chettri

During the peak of the pandemic in August and September last year, infection cases were being reported from across the city, but a majority were from crowded and slum areas of Gandhibagh, Satranjipura, Ashi Nagar, Nehru Nagar and Lakadganj zones. After decline in cases from October to second week of February, the district is witnessing second wave from third week of February and the rise in cases became more prominent since the commencement of March. As per Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) data, the city has recorded 17,933 cases in 14 days of March. Zone-wise least cases during the second wave — 485 (2.7%) — are from Satranjipura, followed by Lakadganj 927 (5.17%). Ashi Nagar zone reported third lowest cases at 1,280 (7.14%). Gandhibagh zone comes fourth with 1,436 cases (8.01%), followed by Nehru Nagar 1,778 (9.91%). Highest cases are from Laxmi Nagar zone, comprising several posh areas. This zone has registered 2,836 (15.81%) cases, majority of them from Dhantoli, Pande Layout, Trimurti Nagar, Laxmi Nagar localities. Over 30 Covid patients were detected from a society in Dhantoli, following which NMC has sealed the entire housing complex a day ago. With 2,649 (14.77%) cases, Mangalwari zone is having second highest number of Covid patients as of now. Hanuman Nagar and Dharampeth zones have reported third and fourth highest cases — 2,406 (13.42%) and 2,244 (12.51%), respectively. In Dharampeth zone, majority of cases are from Ramdaspeth, Civil Lines, Dharamperh, Gokulpeth, Gandhi Nagar, Corporation Colony, Shivaji Nagar, Khare Town etc, all considered as posh localities. Fifth highest cases — 1,892 (10.55%) are from Dhantoli zone and particularly from a few posh housing societies. NMC officials told TOI, “This time, the spread is high in posh areas due to congregation, marriage ceremonies, events, crowding in market places etc. Therefore, various types of restrictions have been imposed on selected activities.” This is also probably the reason behind higher number of positive patients in home isolation. The surge in cases has continued in the district. On Monday, 2,297 cases were registered, which was highest on a single day in the second wave. Also, it was the second highest since the beginning of the pandemic in march last year. Highest 2,343 cases were reported on September 13 last year. Cases were above 2,250 for three consecutive days with 2,261 on March 13 and 2,252 on March 14. It is for the first time in the pandemic that the district has witnessed over 2,000 Covid patients for three consecutive days. The cases surged to 23,011 in 15 days of March, which is higher than that registered in all months, excluding August and September. Last two weeks of August were part of the peak then. Total number of cases in entire August was 24,163, which is certain to be surpassed on Tuesday.

National Medicinal Plants Board, under the Ayush ministry, has recommended that trees with high medicinal and nutritional value should be planted at aanganwadi centres in the state. Ayush ministry has recommended plantation of aonla, khajur, jamun, anar, bel, papaya, agast, gambhaari and sahjan, among others. Taking a leaf out of the ministry’s recommendations, the state government will incorporate these species in the 121 varieties that will be planted this year. At least 30 crore trees will be planted in the state during the monsoon season in July. Last year, Sahjan trees were planted in villages and in areas close to slums so that people from economically weaker sections could use the fruits from the tree as a vegetable. Every part of the sahjan tree is rich in nutrients and can be cooked and eaten. Like Sahjan, other species that have been recommended are significant in Ayurveda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-to-plant-trees-with-high-nutritious-med-value-during-mega-plantation-drive/articleshow/81521027.cms||Neha Shukla

---||Nagpur||Doctors going social media way to treat patients||NAGPUR: During the first wave of Covid-19, doctors in Maharashtra were officially permitted teleconsultation. Since then it has become a popular medium to ensure uninterrupted doctor-patient communication. With the number of patients on the rise again, doctors are continuing the use of technology via a mixed-modified model. After the first consultation, many doctors are advising patients with several non-Covid ailments to send their diagnostic reports on Whatsapp. This is followed by further consultation on video calls. Doctors say this system is proving beneficial for them as well as patients from other states or faraway places. “I do it routinely,” said cardiologist Dr Amar Amale. “Many of our valve replacement cases need routine INR monitoring and expertise regarding adjusting the dose. It’s very convenient to do it on WhatsApp. Also, many post angioplasty and bypass patients have numerous queries and WhatsApp consultation resolves them,” he added. Rheumatologist Dr Parikshit Sagdeo said patients also benefit due to this system. “I consult 3 or 4 patients online daily. They are from faraway locations. In my field, it’s not always necessary to touch and diagnose the patient. Those who are on long-term medication find it very comfortable to consult online,” he said. While avoiding unnecessary visits and saving expenses are the visible benefits, the biggest advantage of this system is psychological support as the patient knows that one good doctor is standing behind him in case of any adverse events. In case of surgeries, post-procedure depression and apprehension is a known factor and WhatsApp feedback works like a counsellor for patients. Senior doctors also shared experiences in which they saved lives of heart patients using mobile updates. “General practitioners in rural areas send the ECG of the patient on WhatsApp. Looking into it and getting feedback from the doctor present there, we can give guidance regarding primary care. This saves many patients from getting mistreated,” said Dr Mahesh Shah. Diagnostic facilities like pathology labs are also providing reports in PDF format which wasn’t the practice earlier. “Since Covid-19 times, we have started sending reports on the WhatsApp number of the patient. This saves time as well as an additional visit of the patient to the lab,” said Dr Prasad Kulkarni of Maharashtra Association of Practicing Pathologists and Microbiologists. Patients are also finding this method comfortable. The elderly and those having severe comorbid conditions feel safe when not visiting the hospital where chances of Covid-19 infection are more. “After my first visit to our rheumatologist, he advised some tests. Reports were shared with the doctor on WhatsApp. He suggested some changes in medicines. The next review is after 45 days,” said prof Dilip Dabir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doctors-going-social-media-way-to-treat-patients/articleshow/81516344.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Goa||Goa’s palm trees and the sea never left Pai’s canvas||PANAJI: From his participation in Goa’s freedom movement to his lifelong obsession with Indian art and music, Laxman Pai, who passed away on Sunday at 95, remained a quintessentially Goan — and Indian — artist. Pai was born in 1926 to the Pai Fondekar family in Margao. It is widely believed that his parents sent him off to the J J School of Art, Mumbai, after he was assaulted by the Portuguese in police custody — an unfortunate incident which later found depiction in his art. But moving away from Goa couldn’t and didn’t stop the rebel in Pai. During his stint at JJ’s from 1943 to 1947, he returned to Goa for a satyagraha outside Margao police station in 1946. “I remember the police would beat me with a thick wooden rod. It left me with swollen hands,” Pai had said, recalling one of his three arrests. Later, he would turn this painful experience into a painting, featuring swollen hands and feet, a grimacing face, and the slogans he had raised. After his Mumbai stint he set sail to Paris in 1951, with friend and fellow artist Sadanand Bakre. In his youth, Pai felt he could only find the creative freedom he longed for outside his homeland. At the École Nationale Superieure des Beaux-Arts, Pai mastered printmaking and oil painting, and the artist’s works transformed into vibrant depictions of Goan life. With memory his only aid, he brought alive temples, churches, paddy fields, beaches, fishermen, kunbis, the sea, and the palm trees. By the time he returned home, Goa was no longer a Portuguese colony. Pai met his wife in Shimla, and although he spent most of his later years outside Goa, the palm trees and the sea never left his canvas. “I have a house in Delhi, (but) Delhi is getting very polluted,” he said at 76. “At first, I was hesitating (about settling in Goa) because my wife (Purnima) is not from Goa. She is from north India, so she was hesitant. But the last time we came here... she seemed to like it. Delhi has also become very crowded. My wife now says it’s alright if we get a place here. So if I can get a place, I can come here.” But that was not to be. He returned to Goa only much later, after Purnima’s passing. Throughout his life, his study of folk art continued through his works, and was especially inspired by kangra and Rajasthani folk styles. But at the end of this transcontinental journey, it was in Goa that he breathed his last, with his beloved palm trees and sea whispering goodbye through the window.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-palm-trees-and-the-sea-never-left-pais-canvas/articleshow/81519477.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Hyderabad||GHMC discards bins, garbage piles up on many Hyderabad roads||HYDERABAD: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation’s (GHMC) attempt to improve the city’s score in the Swachh Survekshan rankings is, unfortunately, leading to more garbage piling up on the city’s roads. As most of the civic corporations in the country, including the GHMC, follow the concept of ‘bin-free city’ and because bins on roads carry negative marks, the civic officials have removed all garbage bins and dumped them in parts of the city, such as Shantinagar (Masab Tank), Khairatabad and other areas. Times ViewA bin-free city is supposed to mean that Hyderabad remains clean with the regular removal of garbage from the streets. This move by authorities to remove bins without creating awareness among people will never improve the swachh survekshan rankings, but turn the city into a big garbage bin. Immediate efforts must be made to bring them back to their rightful places and authorities should stop people from dumping garbage on the roadside.With lack of bins and the existing Swachh tippers unable to cater to all households in the city, the trash is piling up, and ironically, the GHMC parking area was also filled with garbage on Monday. “Dozens of people eat at the Annapurna canteen located adjacent to the GHMC parking lot every day. Without providing infrastructure and a mechanism to dispose of the waste, civic officials warn people of penalties for littering the city,” said Harish Daga, an activist from the city. A resident from MLA Colony in Banjara Hills said that issues of sanitation have been haunting them for a week. “Sanitation standards have gone down since a week, Road Nos. 12 and 11 of Banjara Hills have been filthy,” said P Ram, the resident. GHMC additional commissioner for sanitation, Santosh Badavath, did not respond when TOI tried to contact him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-discards-bins-garbage-piles-up-on-many-city-roads/articleshow/81518033.cms||Nabinder Bommala

---||Goa||Yoga training in Mumbai kept him afloat in Paris||PANAJI: When Laxman Pai moved to Bombay in 1943, he was just 17. Alone in the bustling metropolis, he lived a tough life. His nights were spent sleeping on a common chawl verandah, and his meals were mostly at cheap restaurants that accepted rice plate coupons. In his memoirs, My Search My Evolution, he wrote about how he maintained strict physical and mental discipline by joining a gym, hitting the swimming pool, and jogging at Marine Drive. “I completed a yoga exercise course from Kaivalyadham.” He wrote that this kind of self-discipline and firm conviction helped mould his formative years. While in his initial years in the city, some arrangements were made for his stay at a relative’s house in Girgaon, around 1949, his father invested Rs 10,000 for a flat for him at Mahim’s Saraswat colony. “Difficulties in accommodation even forced me to sleep on office tables of Atrey printing press in Girgaon at night,” he wrote. Back then, Pai neither ate meat nor drank alcohol, so when he moved to Paris, he had to adjust to a wildly different culture. “I had to study and absorb art forms and ideas available in abundance in the Paris museums and art galleries, and also get myself acquainted with western classical music, theatre, operas and ballets,” he wrote. “Having... difference of opinion on art and traditional values, I decided to stand on my own in developing myself and alienated (myself) from the group of Mumbai artists staying Paris.” He adds that Swami Vivekananda’s books on Karmayoga and Dyanayoga were his constant companions. “...Though I did come across Picasso, Chagall and other Ecole de Paris artists, I was not interested in personally meeting them, but instead was keen in viewing and examining their works,” he said. His yoga training too held him in good stead. “I self-imposed this isolation discipline for specific longer periods, and concentrated on my inner evolution of absorbing and digesting by visiting numerous museums, musical concerts, threatres and ballets,” he wrote. “I had with me my flute, dilruba and sitar for relaxation in classical Indian music. I must mention here that this musical instinct was inborn, natural in me, without guidance from any teacher or guru.” But even in the art capital of the world, he still had Goa in his heart. “Most of my paintings done in Paris were from my memory of Goan subjects,” he wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/yoga-training-in-mumbai-kept-him-afloat-in-paris/articleshow/81519490.cms||Lisa Monteiro

The Borivli RTO caters to citizens residing between Goregaon and Dahisar. There are over 5 lakh registered vehicles and more than 4.5 lakhlicence holders in this part of the western suburbs, sources said. Sources said that the work will commence soon and if it is done within a month, it will bring relief to scores of citizens arriving at Borivli RTO for learners’ licence. The new office has more space, unlike the present office at Kandarpada in Dahisar which is crammed and unfriendly while coming for learning licence tests. Licence applicants that comes here for the tests is often seen standing. An official said that a part of funding — to the tune of Rs 35 lakh has been approved — and PWD will begin work of creating sections for conducting learner licence tests, cabins for assistant RTOs and clerks. Officials will also ensure there is proper internet connectivity in the new office as all RTO work has been digitised. The new office is on a government plot with office building structures at MTS depot in Aarey, Goregaon. Sources said the RTO expects more funding of Rs 90 lakh after which the entire Borivli RTO office is proposed to be shifted from Dahisar to Aarey. An official said there will be a huge waiting hall for candidates, adequate space to conduct tests and an additional room for candidates to attend training. “In the present set up at Kandarpada office, our staffers also dont have proper place to sit and work.

The survey is being conducted using high precision gadgets like the Transient Electromagnetic System. A similar survey by the team in 2018 had detected a third paleochannel beneath the surface from Prayagraj to Manjhanpur between the Ganga and Yamuna. The scientists from NGRI and Denmark are tracing the real identity of this water stream and new paths of water conservation. The survey is being carried out by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) under the Namami Gange project. In the previous survey, a 14 kilometre long and five kilometre wide water stream was found between Prayagraj to Kaushambi. The water stream is extinct now, but the survey found evidence of its existence many years ago. This time, the scientists are conducting an aerial survey from Kaushambi (Manjhanpur) to Kanpur. CGWB scientist Shashi Kumar said the aerial survey is being carried out to a depth of 300 metre (around 1,000 feet) beneath the surface with the primary objective of tracing any paleochannel so that water can be conserved, and its resources can be enhanced. The experts would study various components, including soil, pebbles to collect information about the amount of water in that particular area and its proportion. The scientists would collect the specimens and then conduct carbon dating of soil, pebbles, sand and water. Investigations are expected to conclude by the end of this month and the findings would be forwarded to the Central Ground Water Board. The equipment used by the team can extract information from 200-400 metre beneath the earth crust and similar work has already been done in six districts, including Patna, Tumkur, Dausa, Nagpur etc. The main equipment — transient electromagnetic sensors (TEM) — are attached to a helicopter which would fly on the pre-decided longitudes between the two rivers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/search-for-3rd-water-stream-between-ganga-yamuna/articleshow/81516953.cms||---

It was at his photo studio in Margao that Pai first handled the brush and colour as a teenager. Pai’s first cousin on his maternal side and Ramnath’s son, Narayan, says Pai was extremely fond of his uncle, who had an inborn talent for art. “He had a strong bond with my father compared to other relatives and held him in high regard,” Narayan says, recalling his father travelling to Paris to meet Pai in the 1960s. “Pai was born in our house, which is a few houses away from his at Comba, on January 21, 1926. He stayed with us for two to three months after his birth,” Narayan says. Coincidentally, Pai’s paternal grandfather, Xabu Pai Fondekar, was an excellent painter and sculptor. “He often attributed his talent to his artistic hereditary family link,” his first cousin on his father’s side Vaicunth Pai Fondekar says. The entire family of around 200 members had the opportunity of celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi with Pai at their ancestral home in Comba a few years ago and will always cherish the memory, Fondekar says. “We will never forget those days as it was a rare occasion that we celebrated with him after many years. He was not in Goa, so he didn’t have an opportunity to interact with us often. We have lost one of the finest painters who brought good name and fame to our family,” Fondekar says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/he-attributed-talent-to-artistic-family-genes/articleshow/81519507.cms||Lisa Monteiro

A hand written noting by education officer Chintaman Vanjari on NMC’s circular on restrictions was circulated on WhatsApp groups of teachers on Sunday evening. The NMC also issued a notification that up to 25 percent teachers can be called to school if needed. A senior principal said, “I was shocked to see the note in which it was written that 25% of staff can be called to campus. But being grant-in-aid schools, we do not have any choice but to follow government orders.” She said while on her way to school on Monday, the problems started. “I was stopped by cops and they too retorted saying all schools were closed. It took a fair bit of explaining before they let me through.” Vanjari said 25% of teaching and non-teaching staff can be called to campus, in consultation with their management. “At grant-in-aid schools, there are other responsibilities like midday meal ration distribution, submission of monthly salary bills to treasury etc. On the academic front, not every teacher in vernacular schools has a reliable internet connection. Some don’t even have a computer or web cam. For this, they may need to come to school because online education cannot be stopped,” said Vanjari. Even in some engineering colleges outside city limits, teachers were being called for ‘academic work’. While education offices and some schools will function, the restriction on movement is hampering parents vying for RTE admissions. Mohd Shahid Sharif, founder of social organization RTE Action Committee, said, “The entire admission process has been stalled due to technical errors. Confirmation of application cannot be done because no OTP is being generated. Also, on the screen, we are getting message that until further orders do not register your admission. But parents are unable to approach local office here due to restrictions on movement.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/work-from-campus-amid-curbs-baffles-teachers/articleshow/81518081.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The recent actions have revealed that not only the liquor smuggling but even hooch manufacturing has become a lucrative trade in these districts. The Mau police, on Monday, succeeded in recovering 600 bottles of Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) in 50 boxes worth Rs three lakh after arresting a pick up van of liquor smugglers near Babuapur crossing under the limits of Sarai Lakhansi police station. SP Mau Sushil Ghule said that one Chandrika Singh Chauhan of Ghazippur was arrested in this connection and he divulged that the liquor had been procured from Chandigarh in Punjab. It was being taken to Ghazipur by hiding under the boxes of eggs. Earlier, Nonahra police and excise department officials in Ghazipur district had unearthed a hooch manufacturing unit in Rohili village on March 12. SP Ghazipur said that initially the team caught a hooch laden truck by arresting three smugglers identified as Hassan, Karamat Ali of Sultanpur and Govind Shah of Madhya Pradesh. Later, based on the revelations made by them, a manufacturing unit was also unearthed. Although two accused managed to escape from the police net. A consignment of 11,174 IMFL, 400 litres of spirit, two trucks, thousands of empty bottles, wrappers, caps, sealing machines, colour, urea and manufacturing equipment were recovered. Before this arrest, the Nandganj police had also arrested one hooch manufacturer Vinod Bind with 2,835 bottles of illicit liquor and manufacturing equipment from Saurav Mudkatani village. Bind divulged names of his four partners after which manhunt was launched by the police to nab them. Chandauli police arrested one Akhilesh Kumar Singh of Rohtas district in Bihar on March 12 from Barthi Kamraur area when he was trying to cross the state border to enter Bihar with 34.56 lt of IMFL in tetra packs. SP Chandauli Amit Kumar said that Akhilesh had procured liquor from Haryana. Two other notorious liquor smugglers Bhagwan Vishwakarma and Ravi alias Kala were also booked under Gangster Act by the Chandauli police on March 10, he added. The Ballia police, on March 6, had caught two smugglers with a consignment of IMFL of Rs 16 lakh value. A hooch manufacturing unit was also unearthed in Azamgarh. The officials said that vigil on routes leading to Bihar had been increased to put a check on the menace of liquor smugglers after the Bihar government had banned liquor trade and consumption in the state in April 2016. Since then the smugglers, who prefer to procure liquor from Haryana on cheaper cost, started adopting new tricks for taking the consignments to Bihar by hiding it under other goods. Besides, the lucrative business had also started attracting many even inside the police department. Only in past fortnight, nexus of liquor smugglers and men in khaki was initially exposed in Chandauli when SP Ballia initiated a major action against 22 constables of Kandva police station on March 5 while on March 8 SP Ballia Vipin Tada also shunted five policemen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/liquor-smugglers-keep-falling-in-police-net-in-bihar-bordering-dists/articleshow/81517966.cms||---

Nagpur divisional controller Nilesh Belsare said, “We already had less occupancy in buses post restrictions imposed on Saturdays and Sundays. This was followed by an eight-day curbs reducing our trips by 50%. We virtually struggled to get passengers on Monday.” Prior to the lockdown-type restrictions, the Nagpur division had been operating over 900 trips to various parts of the region. “On Saturdays and Sundays, these were brought down to 600 and on Monday we planned 300 trips, but even then there were not much travellers,” said Belsare. “Nagpur division daily earns Rs42 lakh from passenger tickets, but on Monday this was set to drop to Rs15-16 lakh. Similar was the scene in other divisions in the region. We are not getting passengers for cities like Akola and Yavatmal, where Covid-19 restrictions are already in force,” said Belsare. TOI found that buses remained parked at the depot for longer period to get passengers and on average there were 10-15 persons in each bus. “Before imposing restrictions, this figure was 30-35. Due to the curbs, movement of people and occupancy may drop further. At least 35,000 passengers travel in ST buses daily from Ganeshpeth bus stand. However, on Monday the number dropped to 10,000,” said a section of drivers and conductors. Private bus operators were also hit hard on Day-1. They curtailed the operations by 50%. “If police allowed people to travel, we hope the operations will be normal. Today, fewer buses were in operation as many long-distance passengers cancelled tickets and many did not turn up fearing police action. We will have to wait for a week to improve the situation,” said Bobby Saini of Saini Travels. Central Railway spokesperson SG Rao said, “Train movement was normal. Barring vacancies in Mumbai-bound trains, most of the passenger trains to other directions showed waiting list.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/msrtc-suffers-rs25-lakh-loss-on-day-1-of-curbs/articleshow/81518099.cms||---

---||Allahabad||More than 56 lakh students register for UP Board exam||Prayagraj: In spite of the impact of Covid-19 on schools and studies, 56,03,813 students have registered this year to appear in the high school and intermediate examinations of UP Board. This year is also the board’s centenary year. The total number of students appearing in the board exams from April 24 exceeds the population of around 118 countries, including New Zealand, Kuwait, Norway, Finland and Ireland, each having less than 56 lakh citizens. The UP Board, set up in 1921 at Allahabad by an act of the United Provinces Legislative Council, had conducted its first examination in 1923. In its 100 years of journey, the number of students appearing in its high school and intermediate exams has increased 976 times, earning it the distinction of being one of the largest examination conducting bodies of the world. As per records, 5,744 students had registered for the board’s first examinations conducted at 179 centres in 1923. Then 5,655 students were in high school and 89 in intermediate. In a span of 100 years, the count of examinees swelled from 5,744 in 1923 to 56,07,118 (including 30,24,480 in high school and 25,86,339 in intermediate) last year. In 1947, the examinee count swelled to 48,519 for which 224 examination centres were made. The count further increased to 1,72,246 in 1952. “For 2021 exams, a total of 56,03,813 students, including 29,94,312 of high school and 26,09,501 of intermediate have registered. There will be a total 8,513 examination centres this year,” said UP Board secretary Divya Kant Shukla. The number is still high even though UP Board had adopted strict anti-copying measures following which the count of examinees registering for exams had fallen in the past few years. In 2018, as many as 66,37,018 students had enrolled for board exams. As students increased, the UP Board opened regional offices in Meerut (1973), Varanasi (1978), Bareilly (1981), Prayagraj (1987) and Gorakhpur (2017), which are running under regional secretaries. “The increase in the number of examinees has increased the workload many times. Five regional offices were set up over the years new technologies were embraced besides adopting anti-copying measures for holding fair examinations,” said officials. As per the 2019 figures released by the United Nations, 118 countries have less than 56 lakh population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/more-than-56-lakh-students-register-for-up-board-exam/articleshow/81516934.cms||---

Vishal (19), son of Rakesh Shakya (48) of Sultanpur Kalan village had left his home on some personal errand on Monday. On the way, he, however, came to know about his father’s location at the latter’s paramour house. He reached there and on finding his father in a compromising position with his alleged paramour confronted him, leading to a heated argument. In a fit of rage, Vishal whipped out a firearm and opened fire at his father, besides injuring the latter’s alleged paramour. The two sustained injuries and slumped on the ground. According to the inspector of the Friends Colony police station, Anil Kumar Chaubey, Vishal was aware of his father’s alleged affair and had warned him in the past. But he didn’t appear to have paid heed. Things reached a boiling point for Vishal on Monday. On Monday evening, he quarrelled with his father at the latter’s alleged paramour house, saying he wanted to settle the matter once and for all. “In a fit of rage, he opened back-to-back fire on them leaving them critically wounded, and fled the spot,” the Inspector said. He added, “A case has been registered and raids are underway to make the arrest of the accused possible. Both the injured have been admitted to government hospital, where doctors stated the condition of the man to be critical.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/teen-fires-at-father-his-paramour-in-etawah/articleshow/81518015.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Smart lenders kept a margin foreseeing fall in gold rates||NAGPUR: With gold rates falling Rs 11,000 per tola (10 grams) in six months, some smart private moneylenders in the region seem to have planned better than expert bankers. In August, gold was priced at Rs 56,000 a tola, which is now at Rs 45,000 in the local markets. Private lenders, who provide loans against gold, had increased their lending margin much in advance anticipating a fall the yellow metal rates in coming days. In the normal course, loans of up to 70% to 85% of the value of gold are given. Since some months, the lenders had increased the margin to 60% to remain on the safer side. The jewellers, who also run lending business, had foreseen a sharp decline in the coming days. The logic was that a sudden rise in the rates taking it to Rs 56,000 may also lead to an equally fast fall. On one hand, if the bank and certain corporates lending against business had their margins eroded, there are reports of a sizeable section of private lenders remaining in a comfortable position. TOI spoke to lenders in the city and other parts of the region. Pawan Rokde, who has a business in Hingna, said “normally amounts up to 70% of the value of the gold pledged by borrowers is loaned”. “However, considering the sharp increase in rates, we gave advances only up to 60% of the value. This has saved the private lender from crisis,” he said. “Some bigger companies may not have planned so, however, since private lenders mostly deploy their own funds, many of us preferred to play safe. We could foresee a sharp decline in the rates after the steep rise,” said Vatsal Bangre, who runs a jewellery–cum private lending business at Katol. Sanjeev Daga, a jeweller from Achalpur, in Amravati district, also confirmed that the margin was tweaked to accommodate a major fall. Corporate lenders like banks and NBCFCs on the other hand could lend up to 75% of the mortgaged loan. In August, the RBI increased the allowable margin to 90%. The concession is available till March 31. Rajesh Rokde, of M/s Rokde Jewellers, who heads the Sarafa Merchants Association here, however, said there are jewellers who have also suffered margin losses. “Generally an amount up to 70% of the gold’s value is given as loan. However, in some cases it also goes up to 85% considering the long-term relations with the borrowers. Such lenders are facing margin losses,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/smart-lenders-kept-a-margin-foreseeing-fall-in-gold-rates/articleshow/81516379.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Hyderabad||Summer sets in early, Hyderabad hospitals brace for heat stroke cases||HYDERABAD: The summer season has barely set in, but city hospitals have already started reporting cases of heat stroke. Doctors from major private hospitals in Hyderabad say they received between one and four cases over the last two weeks, but expect the numbers to rise. One reason? A prolonged stay-at-home phase, thanks to the pandemic, that’s made people more conditioned to the indoors, say doctors. Records from the last few years show, hospitals started getting heat stroke cases only from April. “We have seen two cases in the last fortnight. Patients had symptoms of fever, mild headache, nausea, vomiting and weakness after being outdoors for a short time. If someone’s body is not acclimatised, exposure to the sun even for a short duration can land them in trouble,” said Dr G Navodaya, consultant general medicine, Care Hospitals. As of now, these cases are being managed in emergency rooms, doctors say more serious cases may arise by month end, requiring hospitalisation. Most vulnerable are children and those with comorbidities. “Toddlers don’t have a proper development of sweat mechanism and among the elderly — those above 65 — the sweat and thirst mechanism are subdued. So, they need to be careful even indoors. Those staying in high-rises are also directly exposed to heat and during power cuts, houses become ovens making them susceptible to heat strokes,” said Dr Rahul Agarwal, senior consultant internal medicine, Medicover Hospitals, who has seen three cases in a fortnight. People with cardiac, renal and lung problems in ‘urban heat pockets’ — areas with less green cover and more concrete — are more prone to heat strokes, added experts. Doctors have advised people to avoid venturing out during afternoon, consume adequate fluids and wear loose cotton clothing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/summer-sets-in-early-city-hosps-brace-for-heat-stroke-cases/articleshow/81518102.cms||Amrita Didyala

In an editorial, the party also claimed that Waze’s arrest by the NIA was an “insult” to Maharashtra police and was done deliberately. “Everything was decided. Those who are happy with Waze’s arrest are making attacks on Maharashtra’s autonomy,” it alleged. “Waze arrested Arnab Goswami and, in return, the Centre arrested Waze,” Saamna stated. “Waze has been on the hit-list of the BJP and Centre ever since he arrested Goswami. The Centre wasn’t willing to wait until Mumbai police had completed their probe. Incidents like the discovery of 20 gelatin sticks are taking place every day in India. Caches of explosives are found in Kashmir valley even today, but did the NIA team go there?” the paper asked.

However, Central agencies do not want that to happen, Saamna alleged. “Nowadays Central agencies rush to Maharashtra as soon as something goes wrong in the state. It is a surprise that a Central probe team should come to Mumbai to investigate 20 gelatin sticks when the ability and courage of Mumbai is praised across the world.” It is clear, Saamna alleged, that the NIA team was in Maharashtra “to settle scores”.

The village situated on the border of Kanpur-Hamirpur is 75-kilometre away from the district headquarters. During his visit to the village a couple of days ago, ADG Zone Bhanu Bhaskar and SSP/DIG Preetinder Singh had announced that a temporary police outpost would be set up in the village. Superintendent of police (rural) Brijesh Kumar Srivastava said, “A temporary police outpost has been set up in the victim’s village and five cops, including a sub-inspector, a head constable and three constables, have been deployed there.” The police outpost will be equipped with all communication gadgets so that cops can inform seniors immediately in case of any emergency and will also cover nearby villages. Sub-inspector Om Prakash has been made in-charge of the temporary outpost that will function from the Panchayat Bhawan for the time being and a review would be done after some time for a permanent police outpost, he added. Ritesh, a local, said “It’s a good step and we are thankful to authorities, but there is an urgent need of a permanent outpost that will instill a sense of security among locals and will deter criminals.” Sajeti Police had filed a case under Sections 376D (A), 504, 506 of IPC and 5G/6 POCSO Act on last Tuesday on the complaint filed by the girl’s father who said that his daughter was returning from the fields around 7pm on Monday when accused Deepu Yadav and Golu Yadav caught her. They took her to a secluded spot and took turns to rape her and threatened to kill her if she raised an alarm. The girl’s family alleged that a day after the incident, Deepu’s brother Saurabh Yadav had threatened to eliminate them if they filed a complaint against him. The survivor’s father was later crushed to death on Kanpur-Sagar highway in front of Ghatampur CHC on March 10. The family had accused the SI of murder. During investigation, the preliminary findings of forensic, surveillance, and police teams, however, ruled out conspiracy or premeditated murder and termed it an accident.

It is very important to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Avoid alcohol and caffeine to prevent dehydration. Apply sunscreen to prevent skin damage and sunburn. It is also important to listen to your body and look for a cool environment if you begin to feel sick. By taking these simple precautions, you can avoid serious heat-related health issues,” said Dr Vykarnam Nageshwar, allergist and immunologist, Aswini Allergy Centre, Chikkadpally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-respite-from-warm-weather/articleshow/81518108.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Vishnu’s home is a ramshackle hut with a tarpaulin overhead for roof. With no work and food to eat, he was clueless and apprehensive about his life. As the news of his hardships spread, local administration, officials, individuals and organisations are extending a helping hand to him. SP Lalitpur Pramod Kumar and CDO AK Pandey went to meet him on Sunday and gave him ration and some household items. SP Lalitpur said, “He has a long life ahead and is mentally and physically sound. We are trying to get some work for him under government schemes for his sustenance.” The CDO told TOI, “We will accommodate him in government schemes like MNREGS as per his suitability.” Recently some volunteers led by Congress leader Rahu Richariya pooled some money for Tiwari and are trying to arrange some job for him. Tiwari was just 23 when on September 16, 2000 a scheduled caste woman of Silawan village under Mehroni police station of Lalitpur district had accused him of raping her. He was subsequently booked under Sections 376, 506 of IPC and Sections 3(1)(xii), 3(2)(v) of SC/ST Act. He was convicted by the sessions court and sentenced to life imprisonment under SC/ST Act and 10 years for rape in 2003 and shifted to Agra jail from where he was recently set free. Vishnu appealed against the verdict in Allahabad High Court in 2005, but the case remained defective for 16 years and could not be heard. In the meanwhile, he lost his parents and two brothers but did not even get bail to attend their funeral. More than a week after being set free after a long ordeal of 20 years, Vishnu is still edgy about his future. The help and compassion of officials and people is enabling him to gather courage to face the challenges that lie ahead for him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/help-pours-in-for-man-set-free-after20-years-jail-on-wrong-conviction/articleshow/81518023.cms||---

He was jailed thrice for taking up novel protests and campaigns criticising the authorities for not taking adequate steps to ensure encroachment of waterbodies across the district. Guna, who studied up to Class VIII came to the limelight for his controversial book ‘Oorar Varaindha Oviyam’ in 2016 which narrates the ordeal faced by dalits on caste-based atrocities unleashed by other communities in the region. The book didn’t go well with the people belonging to the other community creating rift between both communities which led to his ostracization by people from his own community. Guna was arrested in September 2019 after he pasted posters across Kulanthiranpattu village to express his disappointment over inaction on his complaints asking for removal of encroachment in a village waterbody. He was booked under five different sections which includes sections under Tamil Nadu Open Place (prevention of disfigurement) Act booked for pasting posters calling for district collector aspirants for Pudukottai district. The panchayat union tank belonging to rural development department was encroached by a few influential villagers preventing water from stagnating in the tank which eventually led to water scarcity in the village. The land was retrieved by officials within a few days after his arrest. When asked about the reason for his political plunge, he said many of his petitions seeking removal of encroachments from waterbodies and along highways in Pudukottai that have gone unnoticed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/dalit-writer-activist-takes-political-plunge-to-retrieve-waterbodies/articleshow/81519511.cms||Sampath Kumar

He will present the budget before the special standing committee meeting to be held on Wednesday. Radhakrishnan is unlikely to propose any new hike or additional tax on citizens, said sources. The then municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe had projected Rs2,547 crore as Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC)’s income for the current financial year, while former standing committee chairman Vijay Zalke had revised the budget and projected the NMC’s revenue for the year as Rs2,731 crore. Sources said Radhakrishnan may further reduce Mundhe’s projection of Rs 2,547 crore by Rs100 crore for the current fiscal. “He may propose the budget for the next financial year by projecting Rs2,600 crore-plus income,” sources said. The Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected NMC’s revenue. It has hindered the NMC from undertaking any development works, which has fuelled resentment between elected representatives and civic administration. Radhakrishnan has already slashed the allocation in the civic body’s budget under five heads, including roads and ward work funds, by half. Against the sanctioned amount of Rs127.52 crore, the civic chief allocated Rs63.76 crore. Sources said Radhakrishnan’s budget may focus more on strengthening health infrastructure. After the civic chief’s budget, standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar will present his budget by reportedly increasing the revenue of the civic body before mid-June. As the city moves into election year in 2022, the budget is not likely to see any hike in property taxes or water tax.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/radhakrishnan-to-present-nmc-budget-on-march-17/articleshow/81518103.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

This is the first time after schools reopened, that students tested positive in the Secunderabad Cantonment area. The tests were conducted on 84 students and the three tested positive. The tests were conducted after some children showed symptoms. The headmaster of the school immediately alerted parents of the students and sent them back to their hometowns. Medical and health department officials told them about precautions to be taken, including isolation, course of medicines and diet. Though the tests were conducted a couple of days ago, school officials did not disclose the matter to avoid panic among other parents whose children are studying in the same school, according to sources in health department. About precautions taken while testing the students, health staff said they had worn PPE kits the entire time. “We asked school authorities to follow certain key Covid-19 norms such as social distancing, wearing of masks and using of sanitizers. Both students as well teaching staff were cautioned,” said one health staff on condition of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-students-test-positive-in-cantonment-govt-school/articleshow/81518123.cms||Sunil Mungara

Even as RSS functionaries here maintained that RMP was a separate entity, they also said it was a part of the sangh parivar. BJP’s leaders, including legislators and corporators, undergo training here as the institution is also known for shaping the thought process of the allied organizations. The development follows Fadnavis and state’s former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar’s visit to the RSS headquarters. The two had an hour long meeting with RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. Mungantiwar is known to be more close to union transport minister Nitin Gadkari as compared to Fadnavis, goes the grapevine “The move further strengthens Fadnavis’ position in the saffron brigade, especially in projecting him as the future prime ministerial candidate,” said sources. Late Pramod Mahajan had a major contribution in bringing up RMP as a modern institute. RMP, which is named after the late BJP MP Rambhau Mhalgi from Thane, is known to have combination of BJP-RSS and ABVP leaders from the Mumbai at the helm. A person from Vidarbha taking over as the president also has its political significance. Fadnavis, who was earlier the general body member of RMP, is the first from Vidarbha at least in recent past to head the institution. Fadnavis, who replaces RSS senior functionary Anirudha Deshpande, was elected unanimously, said sources. Each president has a five year tenure after which members meet to choose the next president. Normally, a name is suggested as individual members can also moot their own candidate. In such a case, elections are held. However, Fadnavis was elected without any opposition, said sources. Like the RSS, even RMP holds a number of training sessions at different levels, said sources “We also conduct on-the-spot studies for the benefit of the activists, civil servants, and elected representatives. Hence, in Prabodhini, research projects are generally a group assignment. Experts and activists put their minds together and come up with a dispassionate analysis of the issue, invariably after an on-the-spot study of the given topic. In the process, activists grasp the art of forensic analysis while experts come to grip with ground realities,” reads the RMP website.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fadnavis-appointed-chief-of-saffron-thinktank/articleshow/81518110.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Trichy||Stalin follows father’s footsteps, launches campaign from Tiruvarur||Tiruvarur: DMK president M K Stalin began his election campaign from Tiruvarur on Monday, pursuing a similar 28 days long campaign ahead of Lok Sabha election in 2019 that the Dravidian party a resounding success. The decision to pick Tiruvarur as the starting point was seen as a sentimental move as the constituency was held by Stalin’s father M Karunanidhi until his death. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, Stalin commenced his election campaign including the Assembly byelection for Sannidhi street in Tiruvarur on March 20, 2019, and concluded in the same town on April 16, 2019. DMK functionaries said that late DMK supremo M Karunanidhi used to launch the poll campaigns after visiting his mother’s memorial at Kattur in Tiruvarur. Stalin’s move to launch the assembly election campaign from Tiruvarur was seen as an attempt to replicate the same. “With all the chief minister candidates contesting from Chennai and Kongu region, the importance given by our leader (Stalin) to launch campaign from Tiruvarur will earn the support of the entire Cauvery delta people. We hope that he concludes his campaign here,” said Balaji Manikandan, DMK’s IT wing functionary. Stalin attempted to strike a sentimental chord among the audience with ‘Namma Tiruvarur’ (our Tiruvarur). “I, as the son of Kalaignar (Karurnanidhi), start the campaign in Tiruvarur where Kalaignar grew up. You also have come as the sons of Kalaignar. I came here right from the childhood to the president of the party. Now, I have come here as the chief ministerial candidate with the hope of you making as the chief minister,” he said. During campaigning, Stalin recalled that after 13 years of not being in power, when DMK succeeded in the 1989 assembly election, Karunanidhi picked Tiruvarur to conduct the victory rally. He also hinted at conducting the victory rally at the same place by appealing the people to make him the chief minister to enable him to celebrate his victory at Tiruvarur. Stalin wooed the voters by asking them to walk straight into the chamber of the chief minister if any of their demands were not fulfilled in the first 100 days of DMK coming into power. “He (Stalin) himself has said that Tiruvarur is the capital of DMK, so no wonder that he again chose our place to launch the campaign,” said Pazhakkadai Subramanian, a DMK cadre from Sannidhi street. Despite the limited time available for campaigning, DMK functionaries said that their leader was particular in launching the campaign from his father’s hometown. Stalin also challenged chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami’s, who had alleged Stalin was responsible for J Jayalalithaa’s death, to move the court to prove his allegation. “Her (Jayalalithaa’s) health deteriorated during her second term. They were tight-lipped about her health condition. If he (EPS) sticks to his allegation, he could have taken action against me. I am ready to face the case. Are you ready?” he said amidst the cadres of DMK and alliance parties at South Car Street. He also said that he will bring to light the mystery behind the death of Jayalalithaa after he comes to power. Stating that DMK was the one to demand waiver of agriculture loans, he dubbed AIADMK’s election manifesto as a photocopy of poll promises of DMK. DMK candidates –Poondi Kalaivanan for Tiruvarur constituency, TRB Rajaa for Mannargudi constituency, SK Vedarathinam for Vedaranyam constituency, S Jothiraman for Nannilam constituency and its alliance party CPI candidate Marimuthu were present during the campaign.

The vaccination centres in the state where the made-in-India vaccine is administered have received an official letter from the health and family welfare department in this regard. This decision will make Covaxin available in many more centres in coming week. While both vaccines approved by the Government of India are safe, many experts have already given a plus one to Covaxin. Until now, those getting Covaxin jab had to fill up a consent form in advance. Centres where Covaxin is delivered had to maintain an information sheet on the vaccine, informed consent form for each vaccine recipient and an information leaflet for the vaccinator. Now, all these formalities are not required as the Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) has taken the vaccine off clinical mode. Now, more vaccine centres may get Covaxin stock in coming weeks. Even private hospitals are keen to introduce Covaxin there. TOI was first to report on March 9 that Covaxin will be available on the lines of Covishield soon. Dr Uday Narlawar, head of community medicine department of the GMCH, confirmed that direct registration and slot booking for Covaxin began from Monday in hospital. At present, Covaxin is given at two booths in GMCH and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital in Indora. On Monday, 616 doses were given to the beneficiaries. Bharat Biotech announced the first interim analysis of its Covaxin on March 3. The interim vaccine efficacy of Covaxin is 81% in its Phase 3 clinical trial. The trials involved 25,800 subjects, the largest-ever conducted in India. Nagpur was one of the trial sites in the country. There was a participation of nearly1,600 volunteers from the city. Further data was submitted on March 9 and the DCGI allowed Covaxin without consent from March 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/consent-form-not-needed-for-covaxin-now/articleshow/81518114.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta and senior advocates Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech, requested the SC to bring together various pleas in different HCs and consider the issues. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian agreed to hear on March 18 applications filed by the two manufacturers, along with a pending PIL by Arvind Singh, who had sought a direction for priority vaccination of lawyers, their staff, judges, court staff and others involved in the justice delivery system. With HCs entertaining PILs seeking vaccination of lawyers and judges, the Centre put its foot down and told the SC that it could not discriminate against other professionals by vaccinating the legal community in breach of the policy to inoculate those above 60 years and those above 45 with co-morbidities. The Delhi HC had recently criticised the Centre for keeping a tight leash on use of vaccines manufactured by Bharat Biotech (Covaxin) and Serum Institute (Covishield) and questioned export of the shots. “We are not utilising it fully. We are either donating it to foreign countries or selling it to them and are not vaccinating our own people. So, there has to be that sense of responsibility and urgency,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli had said on March 4. The HC had also sought details of production capacity of the two manufacturers and an inventory of unused stock. The Union government said it would not alter the policy decision to vaccinate those above 60 years and those over 45 with co-morbidities. “Government of India has tremendous respect for the profession, but it may not be desirable to create a separate class consisting of lawyers or others below the age of 45 years to discriminate against people engaged in other trades, professions or businesses as such a classification would lead to discrimination,” it said.

It said most states started with vaccination of people over the age of 75 years and lowered the age limit gradually. Probably answering the Delhi HC which questioned exports, the Centre said there was a certain quantity of doses that could be administered daily by the available manpower and infrastructure. India exported only the number of doses that was produced by the two manufacturers in excess of the daily domestic requirement. “Once epidemic takes pandemic form, its management has to be done keeping in mind the entire globe as a unit and it is not possible to take a country-specific approach. India is not immune to the pandemic till the world at large has contained the disease. Low/middle income countries as well as nations with limited access to pharmaceutical technologies are at debilitating disadvantages in dealing with the pandemic. To this end, the government has allowed only limited export of vaccines while according highest priority to domestic needs,” the Centre said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-urges-sc-to-step-in-as-hcs-vaccine-orders-may-cause-confusion/articleshow/81521645.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Where is this coming from, if not at home? What is the fault of teachers or schools? Where am I taking my son, showing his knees and in tattered jeans? Girls are no less, showing their knees. Is this good? All of this, in a mad race of westernisation. While the western world follows us, doing yoga … covering their body properly. And we run towards nudity,” the newly-appointed chief minister said at the inaugural session of the two-day workshop organised by the Uttarakhand State Commission for Protection of Child Rights in Dehradun. Commenting on the sartorial choices of young mothers, he said he was shocked to meet a woman who ran an NGO wearing ripped jeans. “If this kind of woman goes out in the society to meet people and solve their problems, what kind of message are we giving out to the society, to our kids? It all starts at home. What we do, our kids follow,” he added. “A child who is taught the right culture at home, no matter how modern he becomes, will never fail in life.” Newly appointed cabinet minister Ganesh Joshi, on similar lines, had earlier said all women should focus on raising good kids. “Women talk about all things they want to do in life, but the most important thing for them is to look after their family and kids,” the 59-year-old former army man said. Rawat also said all kids should be taught in the Hindi medium. “It is not only by English-medium instruction that one becomes successful in life. I know many who have read in Hindi-medium. I have seen UP, Delhi, Uttarakhand — we have the most IAS (officers) and bureaucrats. They studied in Hindu-medium (institutions). There is a race for English-medium study but if a student of English medium is not taught for at least two to three hours, he is gone. If tuitions are not given right from LKG and UKG (lower kindergarten and upper kindergarten), kids go nowhere. Go by Hindi medium, give good values, good knowledge,” he said. Circling back to substance abuse, the theme of the meet he was addressing, Rawat said, “There was a sweeper at the hostel I stayed in … He used to collect the filth of all students. We would go through the market and dump the waste far away. Today, his son is a civil officer in the Arunachal (AGMUT) cadre … Whatever the child saw, he learnt. Whenever I visited their house, it was neat and clean.” He added, “Therefore, the use of tobacco, liquor and drugs is because of environment. In the house, parents ask the child to take liquor out of the cabinet for guests. What kind of an environment is this for a child? What impact will it have? What character will he develop?"

Due to the scorching summer, parties have been refraining from campaigning during the afternoons. Unlike the Parliamentary election, parties say the campaigning for assembly elections has to be done through face-to-face interaction with the voters. For the past few days, the landlocked towns and districts including Karur, Salem and Erode have been recording temperature around 37 degree Celsius. Barring hill stations, there was around +1 to +2.5 degree Celsius departure in maximum temperature from the normal temperature in various parts of the state including Chennai For the next week, parts of the state including Salem, Trichy and Madurai are expected to record a maximum temperature around 37 and 39 degree Celsius. The scorching weather that gathers steam at around 1pm has made the candidates across parties skip meeting the voters. “We have prepared a poll campaigning schedule by avoiding activities between 1pm and 5pm. Summer is making it too difficult for the senior functionaries and candidates to continue the interaction,” a functionary in DMK camp said. “Since the summer is too harsh, we are advancing the campaign in the morning by around 8. The time available is too low to introduce the candidate to voters. Usually, the candidate will visit a locality twice, this time it could be difficult,” a functionary in the AIADMK said. Most politicians said they rely on buttermilk and tender coconut to beat the heat. “As the days progress, the intensity of the dog days will only increase. At the same time, we can expect a few spells of convectional rainfall by the end of March or early April,” N Selvakumar, Mannargudi-based independent weather observer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/sultry-weather-curtails-campaigning/articleshow/81519540.cms||Deepak Karthik

When compared to the 2019 assembly elections, the vote share of party slumped by 8.4%. TDP’s poor show benefited the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the independents, many of whom are rebels from the ruling party. The vote share of Pawan Kalyan’s Janasena Party dipped by only about one percent, while the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) vote share also did not improve much. Interestingly, independents who got 0.9 percent of the votes in 2019 bagged 5.7 percent in the municipal polls. Jansena got 4.6 percent, while the BJP improved slightly to 2.4 percent from 0.8 percent in 2019. Despite having an alliance, the BJP and Janasena failed to have any impact. Political secretary to Janasena chief, P Hari Prasad, said, “We have contested only in those wards and municipalities where we are strong. If we take the percentage of vote share only from the contested seats it has improved when compared to the assembly elections.” Janasena had contested in 137 assembly constituencies in 2019 and won just one seat. If only contested seats are taken into account the vote share of Janasena was 5.53 percent (2019) and 7 percent (2021). Janasena contested in 320 wards and won 21 in the municipalities and won seven out of 224 wards in corporations. Minister for water resources P Anil Kumar Yadav said, “Municipal polls verdict has proved that people had lost faith in TDP as drubbing was worse than that in the 2019 elections. The welfare schemes being implemented by the state government, transparency in governance and the reforms taken up by the chief minister had won the people’s faith. We have swept all the municipalities by winning 99 percent of them and 84 percent wards.” In 2014 municipal polls, TDP won 58 of the 92 municipalities in Seemandhra in the united AP and YSRCP won 16. In 18 municipalities, it was a hung verdict then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ap-municipal-elections-tdp-vote-share-slumps-by-8-4/articleshow/81518182.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

According to RMC, the rise in coronavirus cases was marginal in the city over the past few days. “There is no alarming situation currently in the city. There is only one patient on ventilator and only 5% hospital beds are occupied currently,” said RMC commissioner Udit Agrawal. On Sunday, 61 cases are reported from RMC area. The average per day fresh cases reported in Rajkot has remained between 50 and 60 since beginning of March. Nearly 1,000 health workers are involved in door-to-door survey in areas where people have tested positive in past fortnight or so. Civic body’s health officials said that more Covid-19 positive cases were reported from the western part of the city. They said the main reason could be people letting their guard down as the number of cases decreased. The RMC along with the city police will start strict enforcement of Covid-19 norms like wearing masks and maintaining social distance to prevent the spread of the virus. There will be regular checks at public places like main markets, shops and malls. If found in violation of Covid-19 guidelines, penal action will be taken. In extreme cases closure notice could also be issued, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/follow-covid-rules-or-face-closurermc/articleshow/81519626.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Pawar meets Uddhav; no talk of min, police reshuffle: NCP||MUMBAI: NCP president Sharad Pawar on Monday said at a meeting with senior party ministers that the Sachin Waze episode was “serious”, according to reports. The Shiv Sena had blamed the home minister, Anil Deshmukh of NCP, on Sunday for inept handling of the controversy, but the NCP said on Monday there was no discussion at the party meet either on relieving Deshmukh of the home portfolio or of a reshuffle in the higher echelons of Mumbai police led by Parambir Singh. Significantly, Pawar had a marathon meeting on Monday with CM Uddhav Thackeray on the political situation. “Pawar is keen to know why the explosives were placed outside the residence of Mukesh Ambani. If Waze is really involved in placing the explosives, it’s a serious matter. It will have an adverse impact on the credibility and image of the government,” an NCP leader said. In the wake of the damage caused to the Maha Vikas Aghadi government by the controversy, Pawar had two meetings with his party colleagues. The first was attended by NCP’s cabinet members, while the second meeting was attended by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Deshmukh, food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal, housing minister Jeetendra Awhad and skill development minister Nawab Malik. In the meeting with the select group, there was in-depth discussion of the Waze episode. According to reports, while Ajit Pawar and Deshmukh briefed the NCP chief, Pawar observed that it was a serious matter. The general view in the meeting was that if high-profile police officials and encounter specialists were indulging in such illegal activities, it would send a wrong message to the entire state. It was decided in the meeting that since the NIA has stepped in and the Anti-Terrorism squad too is probing the sensitive case, it would be appropriate to wait for the probe’s outcome.An NCP leader said it is expected that the ATS, at least, will submit an interim report on the matter. “We will decide the course of action after receiving the report. If officials are found guilty and if they were hand-in-glove with Waze, stern action will be taken against them,” the NCP leader said. In his brief meeting with cabinet members, Pawar reviewed the performance of different state departments and steps to be taken for improving the situation. State NCP president Jayant Patil said that was a routine review meeting which Pawar holds at regular intervals. “Pawar took a review of the performance of all departments. There was no discussion on removal of Anil Deshmukh or on shunting out Mumbai police chief Parambir Singh. We will have to wait for the outcome of the probe being conducted by ATS before deciding the course of action,’’ Patil said. A Sena leader said the MVA government is at the receiving end for inept handling of the controversy. “Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis took the entire credit for the transfer and arrest of Sachin Waze. We did not step in at the right moment and are now paying the price for our casual approach,” the Sena leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pawar-views-devpts-as-serious-meets-uddhav/articleshow/81521533.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Chennai||Water in Kannagi Nagar not potable; TDS, chlorine above limit, finds study||Chennai: Water in Kannagi Nagar is not fit for human consumption, a study by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and VHS (Voluntary Health Services) has found. The hospital, as part of its slum intervention programme, holds regular medical camps in the area, where people often suffer from skin diseases. Project director Joseph Williams said they wanted to check if the quality of water could be behind the skin ailments. “We collected water from the sump at a corporation office and sent it to a private lab. The lab report stated that this water was not fit for human consumption,” he said. According to the report, the total dissolved solids (TDS) in the sample was 575, higher than the permissible 500, and the chlorine content, which should not be above 250 milligrams per litre, was found to be 270 milligrams per litre. TOI shared the lab report with Dr Prabhu Shankar, executive director of Metrowater, for comment but he did not respond.Rajan R, a resident, said he visits the community health Centre on Tuesdays when the skin specialist is available. “About 100 outpatients visit the hospital on that day,” said a doctor at the centre. However, they said the problem had a lot to do with the poor hygiene and sanitation in the area and not just water. Each apartment complex in the area has about 15 houses and residents take water supplied by the corporation through the taps on the street. “The day I found red worms in the water, I stopped drinking it. I am forced to buy can water, which costs Rs 35,” said Kavitha, a resident. Another resident Sripriya said, “The water is black in colour for half an hour. Later it turns yellow or orange. The water also smells bad. Every house needs about 15 pots of water, to last four days. We also fill a few drums for emergency purposes. We use this water for cooking, washing and bathing. But we have stopped drinking it a few years ago. We purchase one 20 litre can once every two days, which costs Rs 35. We are forced to spend at least Rs 1,000 on drinking water every month. This is for a smaller family,” she said. “About 30% of our salary goes in purchasing drinking water,” said Tamilselvan, a resident. The foundation now plans to set up a water ATM in the area. “Unclean tanks and mixing of sewage into the pipelines could be behind the filthy water. We have suggested setting up a water ATM with a capacity of 5,000 litres of water per day. This will help 250 houses. We are in talks with corporates willing to sponsor the project. We will create a business model and ask 28 self-help groups to run it. They can use the revenue for maintenance and to resolve other issues in the area,” said Williams. Dr Vijayraman, director of VHS, said they got Rs2cr from the foundation to work on the slum and they could use that fund to set up at least five to seven such ATMs. “First, we will set up one. Then, we will plan more in coordination with the government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/water-in-kannagi-nagar-not-potable-tds-chlorine-above-limit-finds-study/articleshow/81518210.cms||---
---||Chennai||All vanilla, no masala: Star hotels get rid of frills to foot Covid bill||CHENNAI: The linen is no-nonsense. The remote is ensconced in a sealed paper bag. Your cutlery comes out of a UV sanitizer box. In short, Covid-19 protocol in, minibar out. In most hotels now, it isn’t just service with a smile, but with a spritz of sanitizer, everywhere you move, from the security station to the check-in to the corridors to the spa, and restaurant. “It’s safety of the guest first,” says Shabin Sarvotham, senior GM, Radisson GRT, Chennai. Which is why in their hotel, the beds are now reduced to pure white brass tacks – sheets, duvet, bed cover and pillows. “All the decorative throw pillows and bed runners are out,” he says. The TV remotes, coffee-tea sachets, and toiletries come in individual pouches. And to reduce wastage, the welcome fruit basket in every room has been replaced by a note asking you to dial room service to receive your fruit of choice. Cutting out the frills and focusing on safety regulations is actually costing hotels more. Sarvotham says each room now costs the hotel Rs 20-30 extra a day. And that is making the hotels to balance their costs and trim the requirement for niche luxuries and focus more on sourcing locally without compromising on quality. At ITC Grand Chola, a few room amenities such as stationery, and minibar/refreshment centre have been removed and been made available on request, says Ajit Bangera, senior executive chef, ITC Grand Chola. E Residences and Hotel general manager Shafee Ahmed said: “These days most of the guests bring their own personal care products. So it makes sense to give them on demand. This allows us to cut costs because these items need to be replaced even if they are not used.“ The Hilton Chennai too is making adjustments to its routine in a bid to balance the cost that goes in sanitisation and disinfecting. “Previously the cleanliness part in a hotel was limited to the aesthetic sense. The cleanliness part has reached to the clinical level. For Hilton we have started with our own initiative called 'Clean Stay'. This is a brand Hilton has launched globally to deal with the pandemic, which includes training of staff for cleanliness, use of chemicals etc," said Ruban Das general manager, Hilton Chennai. The hotel focuses on six or seven areas in a room which is frequently touched -- the remote, telephone, writing desk, wash basin -- and cleans them specially and then treats the room with UV and anti-viral treatment and seals it for the next guest. Consequently, the operating cost has gone up slightly. “We are adjusting other cost lines to make customers confident. We are going local, replacing some brands. There used to be a lot of imported meat or canned food and other items. These were replaced with locally made produce. A lot of the workforce were redundant in the industry so we asked our employees to learn multiple skills, like laundry skills, front desk skills. Many Categories of staff including the concierge have been told to learn everything.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/all-vanilla-no-masala-star-hotels-get-rid-of-frills-to-foot-covid-bill/articleshow/81518204.cms||Kamini Mathai

Neeru’s husband Nitin said they were waiting to take Covaxin as they had learnt the after-effects were negligible. Four members of the Vazirani family were also among those who took Covaxin. 68-year-old Vijay Vazirani said they had booked an appointment at JJ Hospital, which was previously the only Covaxin centre in Mumbai, but came to BKC after finding that slots were available. Of 44,683 vaccinated in Mumbai on Monday, 43,763 took Covishield and 920 took Covaxin. Five centres have been given 2,000 doses each of Covaxin. Dean of SevenHills Hospital Dr BalaKrishna Adsul said, “We vaccinate over 3,000 in a day, 2,000 doses will be exhausted in a day.” The centre anticipates a rise in demand from locals since Shiv Sena leader Ravindra Waikar took the vaccine on Monday. At BYL Nair Hospital, 21 people took Covaxin on Monday. “We can’t offer a choice since we have limited doses, but we are letting people know we have it,” said Dr S Suryawanshi, nodal officer for vaccination. He added that people should also be mindful that they can’t mix the two types of vaccines. In Mulund’s jumbo facility, 22 were given Covaxin, said dean Dr Pradeep Angre. He said the centre had over 5,000 vaccine doses in stock. Overall, the day’s immunisation coverage was far below the one lakh vaccinations that the civic authorities intended to carry out daily this week. Worryingly, Pune and Thane reported a shortage of vaccines, though officials said Mumbai had adequate doses for the next 8-10 days. BMC’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said the city had over 3lakh doses. Authorities at Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) said the shortage was so acute that they have decided to taper down pace of immunization. Hospitals in Pune are also reporting a severe shortage of Covishield with some claiming to have supplies for barely a day. Pune’s KEM hospital reported having not more than ten doses of Covishield, while Ruby Hall authorities said their stock of 400 Covishield doses would last till Tuesday. Public health minister Rajesh Tope, however, claimed there was no shortage in the state. “But efforts are being made to increase the number of vaccinations in private and government hospitals,” he said. “Our priority now is to speed up the drive. We have sent names of dozen more hospitals to the Centre for approval,” said Dr Gomare adding that as hospitals are ready with infrastructure, names will be sent for approval. Civic authorities had said the plan is to complete vaccination of 30lakh people from priority groups before monsoon.

The Harni police on Monday nabbed Vajesinh Dabhi, a resident of New VIP Road, for allegedly killing his wife Kokila Dabhi, suspecting that she was having an extramarital affair. According to the police, Vajesinh and Kokila were at loggerheads for some time. Vajesinh suspected that his wife was having an affair with someone and often got into a fight with her. On March 12, she left her home at about 3 pm and returned in the evening. She again left in evening that enraged Vajesinh, who then decided to kill her. At about 10.30 pm, Vajesinh went out looking for Kokila and spotted her near Khodiyarnagar. Vajesinh first strangled her and then hit her with a cement block that was lying nearby before fleeing from the spot. Vajesinh then went home and acted as if nothing happened.

---||Kochi||Kochi corporation to install incinerator to treat sanitary waste||KOCHI: Kochi corporation is planning to install an incinerator at the solid waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram in order to treat disposable diapers and sanitary napkins. Currently the local body is not collecting disposable diapers and napkins since they don’t have a facility to treat it. This has led to napkins getting accumulated in waterbodies and roadsides, adding to the environmental pollution. No agency has so far conducted a study to assess the amount of sanitary waste generated in the city. Though sanitary waste is not being collected, workers at the plant come across diapers or napkins along with food waste. A senior health official admitted there was a directive to set up an incinerator to treat sanitary waste. But corporation health standing committee chairperson T K Ashraf has denied this. As per the Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, the items contaminated with blood and body fluids, including cotton, dressings, soiled plaster casts, linens and beddings, are biomedical waste which should be incinerated, autoclaved or microwaved to destroy pathogens. “The correct procedure is to take back the used diapers and napkins by the manufacturers themselves under extended producers responsibility (EPR). They should approach the local body for implementing it. But nothing happens as per rules. The immediate measure is incinerating the sanitary waste as per biomedical waste treatment methods where double chambers are used with high temperature,” said pollution control board (PCB) environmental engineer (Ernakulam) M A Baiju. Another PCB official in Thiruvananthapuram said incinerating the sanitary waste in 950 degrees Celsius will help remove dioxane and other chemical components. “We have been directed not to collect sanitary waste like diapers and napkins. But residents continue to mix it with both plastic and food waste. When we treat degradable waste, sanitary waste gets separated and we keep it in separate sacks in bundles. People wrap the sanitary waste in pouches and keep it along with other wastes so that waste collectors do not notice it. There is no decline in the amount of sanitary waste reaching the plant.

---||Chandigarh||Haryana House passes resolution against boycott of political leaders||CHANDIGARH: The Haryana assembly passed a resolution condemning any attempt to boycott political leaders, a move which follows protests against the ruling coalition leaders in several villages over the Centre’s farm laws. Of late, even those MLAs who did not support the no-confidence motion against the state government have been facing protests by the locals. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar moved the resolution during the zero hour on Monday, which led to arguments with the opposition Congress, which staged a walkout from the assembly even as the resolution was passed with voice vote. Notably, the resolution was moved after speaker Gian Chand Gupta elaborated on the March 10 incident, wherein Akali MLAs had staged a protest in the assembly complex and breached Khattar’s security. Before the resolution was moved, BJP’s Ambala City MLA Aseem Goel referred to a protest outside his residence recently and alleged that he was intimidated by protesting farmers and villagers. He blamed the Congress leaders for the incident, which led to arguments over the issue of public representatives being barred or obstructed by agitators or group of people from visiting public places. Former speaker and Beri MLA Raghubir Singh Kadian opposed Goyal, but soon after Khattar proposed to move a resolution, saying, “Being a member of the House, we must condemn such incidents.’’ Khattar also accused the Congress of instigating farmers and supporting those boycotting BJP-JJP leaders, a charge which leader of opposition Bhupinder Hooda denied vehemently. “On the floor of the House, on behalf of my party, I want to say that no Congress member is instigating them (farmers). We are only supporting their demands... As for such incidents, the law should take its own course. We can assure that none of the Congress members supports such persons,” said Hooda. While the speaker was making the announcement of moving a resolution brought by Khattar, Congress MLAs staged walkout and the resolution was passed with voice note. Box to go with Face-off over name of college Even a statement made by Khattar over the naming of yet to be constructed Medical College of Bhiwani led to arguments between Choudhry and him. Khattar had announced that the proposed college at Bhiwani civil hospital would be named after Pt Neki Ram Sharma. However, Choudhry stated that the hospital has already being named after former chief minister Bansi Lal. “We have no problem in renaming of the medical college, but Chaudhary Bansi Lal’s name should not be forgotten or removed,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/assembly-passes-resolution-against-boycott-of-political-leaders-amid-cong-walkout/articleshow/81519683.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Mumbai||20k autos get revised meters but union says can be rigged in Mumbai||Mumbai: With 20,000 autorickshaws now sporting the recalibrated meters with Rs 21 as minimum fare, union leader Thampy Kurian alleged that these can still be rigged using an external wire and a switch. The city also has close to 500 kaali-peeli cabs with the recalibrated meters. Each meter is being fitted by an authorised repairer using chips supplied by RTO-approved meter manufacturers. The meter then undergoes a bench test (testing it for a 48km run and fixing the first seal on it) before it is affixed to the auto or taxi and run on test tracks in the presence of RTO officials—who give their final seal and stamp on it. Kurien said, “Although a majority of drivers and owner are honest and will refrain from rigging meters, this is still possible and is done by rogues at airports, railway stations and ST stands.” Kurien further said, “The pulse of the meter is manipulated to show inflated readings. This is usually done clandestinely, with passengers not knowing. For example, the meter will run properly for 2km. But at the next signal, when the vehicle is stationary, the driver will quietly press a switch hidden under the seat or near the gear which will ensure that the meter drops faster than normal. The final fare will be close to double the usual fare, and those who are not regular travellers will fail to notice.”  RTO officials said on Sunday they have made meter tests on their tracks stringent but unions alleged there were agents who demanded up to Rs 300 to get an auto taxi meter passed. Maqbool Mujawar from Navbharatiya Shiv Vahtuk Sanghatana said, “We have asked auto drivers to not fall prey to such unscrupulous elements.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/20k-autos-get-revised-meters-but-union-says-can-be-rigged-in-mumbai/articleshow/81519742.cms||Somit Sen

But the world’s tallest statue has surpassed all the expectations. Within 30 months, over 50 lakh tourists visited the statue that is located on the banks of Narmada River. Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNL) managing director, Rajiv Gupta tweeted on Monday ‘Statue of Unity crosses five million visitors mark.’ He added that the monument built under the visionary leadership of PMO has emerged as an international tourist destination, offering multiple attractions for all age groups. After being inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi, the 182-metre statue became quite popular with the tourists. The SoU authorities soon added other attractions including Jungle Safari, butterfly park, cactus park, river rafting and cruise in the tourist zone. In fact, within a year of its inauguration, the SoU surpassed the footfall of Statue of Liberty in the USA. SoU officials claimed that in November 2019, SoU saw an average daily footfall of 15,036 in comparison to Statue of Liberty’s 10,000. In August last year, the TIME Magazine included SoU in its prestigious list of World’s Greatest Places — a compilation of 100 new and noteworthy destinations to experience in the year. SoU was closed for tourists during the lockdown but after it opened in October visitors’ flow picked up. The seaplane service between Ahmedabad and SoU further gave a boost to the tourists’ number. SoU spokesperson said that the number of visitors shot up sharply on extended weekends, holidays and New Year Eve. At times it became difficult to manage the rush, said the spokesperson. One of the major attractions at the SoU is the Jungle Safari — a zoological park spread over 375 acres. The park is home to 350 exotic animals such as giraffe, zebra, impala, bison, lion, tiger, leopard and various and bird species. Gujarat’s first a crocodile park, which will also act as a breeding centre for the reptiles, is also planned at the SoU in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/statue-of-unity-crosses-five-million-tourists-mark/articleshow/81519702.cms||Tushar Tere

A first-year Malayalam student has complained against SFI leaders for brutally harassing and manhandling him for more than 10 hours on Friday. The student, a native of Areekode in Malappuram, named nine SFI members, including leaders, in the complaint with Central police. According to him, he faced the wrath of SFI leaders on Friday night at the men’s hostel for refusing to take part in fund-raising activities for the organization. “I am staying outside as I have not been allotted a room in the hostel. I went to the hostel on Friday night along with two friends. My plan was to discuss the hostel issue with the SFI leaders. I went to room number 86 on the third floor, where the seniors stayed. They asked me to participate in fund-raising activities which I refused. When they raised the same earlier, I refused to abide,” he said. “At the hostel, they threatened me that it would be difficult to continue in college if he refused again. I tried to leave the room but they pulled me back. SFI unit secretary Akhil first slapped me on my face. Others then joined in. A slap on my cheek affected my hearing. They snatched my mobile phone and did not allow me even to attend the call of nature. They let me out of the room at around 10am. I informed my friends and went to the General Hospital for medical tests. I mailed my complaint to the college principal but I haven’t received any response so far,” he added. Meanwhile, SFI leaders refuted the allegations and said the junior student attempted to sexually harass a female student on the college campus. “He raised the ragging issue after a sexual harassment case against him. We advised the female student to file a complaint with the principal. This incident provoked him to raise ragging allegations against us. The complaint against him was given on March 12,” said Akhil Pushpan, SFI unit secretary. College principal Mathew George said that he received both the complaints on Sunday night by email. “I forwarded the ragging complaint to the anti-ragging cell seeking a report and sexual harassment complaint to the anti-sexual harassment committee and the police. The complainant in the sexual harassment allegation filed a complaint in person on Monday,” said George.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ragging-sexual-abuse-plaints-rock-maharajas/articleshow/81518290.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Weekly TPR in TVM goes below 3 for first time in eight months||Thiruvananthapuram: Weekly Covid-19 test positivity rate (TPR) in the district has gone below three for the first time since July 2020. The first two weeks of March showed weekly positivity rates dropping to 2.5 and 2.9. This is lower than the TPR recorded for the entire state. Between February last week and March second week, weekly positivity rate ranged between 4.5 and 3.6 in the state. TPR in the district had begun to climb towards the last week of January, marking a rise from 4.9 to 6.5. However, since then the rate has come down sharply — a dip from 6.3 to 2.5 by the first week of March. As on Sunday, the cumulative RT-PCR positivity in the district was 6.6% while antigen positivity stood at 11.1%. In the past 15 days, daily TPR had remained below 5% in the district. On February 28, TPR was 3.26%. Except for a marginal rise to 4.25% on March 7, TPR has remained below 4% in the district. The lowest TPR was recorded on March 3 — 2.5%. The positivity rate in coastal areas had been really high since July 2020 when community transmission was officially confirmed in the district. It declined by the last week of August since people were reluctant to come for testing. Over the period from July 1 to August 22, 4,895 positive cases were reported in 11 coastal panchayats. Nearly 28,769 samples were tested and average positivity rate was 17%. Four clusters reported a positivity rate above 20%: Poonthura (20.4%), Pulluvila (29.1%), Anchuthengu (23.6%) and Poovar (21.2%). By the second week of December, the weekly RT-PCR positivity in the district had gone below five for the first time since July. The positivity rates of RT-PCR in the first two weeks of December had been 4.4 and 4.2. Any rate below five is indicative of low levels of disease transmission. RT-PCR positivity rate in the district peaked to 9.2% in the third week of July and went as high as 17.9% by the third week of August. In the following months, it tended to dip slightly and post Onam, the graph peaked again to touch 17.5 by the fourth week of September. It was from the middle of October that RT-PCR positivity began to come down in the district. The rate has been below seven since the second week of November, which has reflected dip in transmission. Low RT-PCR positivity rates had been reported in December with the highest number of RT-PCR tests.

---||Chandigarh||Plea against 75% domicile job quota in pvt sector withdrawn||Chandigarh: The petition challenging the Haryana government’s new law providing 75% reservation for state domiciles in the private sector was withdrawn from the Punjab and Haryana high court for being premature. When the matter came up for hearing before the HC on Monday, the division bench observed that the state government is yet to enforce The Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, so the petitioner industry was not adversely affected by it. After this, the petitioner’s counsel advocate Vishan Sharma withdrew the petition with the liberty to file the same as and when the Act is enforced in the state. M/s A K Automatics, a Rohtak-based industrial unit had challenged the law on the ground that by introducing son-of-soil policy, the Haryana government wanted to create reservation in private sector which was infringement of the constitutional rights of the employers because private sector jobs are based purely on skill and analytical blend of mind of employees. “The Act is an attempt to introduce a domicile methodology to get a job in the private sector rather than on the basis of their educational skills and mental IQ, which will create a chaos in the current industrial employment structure for industries in Haryana. The law is also contrary to the Centre’s Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat programme, which aims to have an integrated and mobile labour market within the country, which will also disrupt post-Covid-19 recovery of private sector and raise thoughts of relocating to other states,” the petition had submitted. It was also argued that the Act notified by the Haryana government is an act of unfair competition between deserving employees and local residents of Haryana acclaiming to have a right for job on the basis of residence. BOX What the law stipulates According to the law, 75% jobs in the new factories/industries or already established industries/institutions would be given to the domiciles of Haryana. The new law provides for 75% employment to local candidates for jobs having salary of less than Rs 50,000 per month in various privately managed companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms and partnership firms among others situated in Haryana and employing 10 or more persons. The state government enacted the law on the insistence of Dushyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), that had promised such a provision in its election manifesto.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/plea-against-75-domicile-job-quota-in-pvt-sector-withdrawn/articleshow/81519815.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi is less noisy, but for RK Puram||NEW DELHI: Noise pollution seems to be largely on the decline in the city, both during the day and night, according to the yearly average ambient noise data gathered since 2015 from five real-time noise monitoring stations. RK Puram in southwest Delhi, however, has been recording an increase in noise pollution both in the day and at night. Among the 21 new noise monitoring stations installed by Delhi Pollution Control Committee, Karol Bagh has emerged the noisiest location, while Najafgarh and Alipur are the least noisy. Delhi had for long had five noise monitoring stations at Anand Vihar, Civil Lines, Mandir Marg, Punjabi Bagh and RK Puram, all of them under DPCC. It was only last year that 21 new noise monitoring stations were set up across the city in order to better assess the noise levels. DPCC data from 2015 shows that Anand Vihar had an annual daytime ambient noise decibel average of 67.8 dB(A) that year. However, this dropped to 65.6 dB(A) by 2019. In 2020, it further fell to 61.4 dB(A), largely due to the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown. Similarly, Civil Lines and Punjabi Bagh have shown a reduction in daytime noise levels over the years, falling from 62.9 and 63.4 dB(A), respectively, in 2015 to 61 and 58.3 dB(A), respectively, in 2019. While the noise at Mandir Marg has largely remained consistent, daytime noise pollution at RK Puram increased from 60.3 dB(A) in 2015 to 62.1 dB(A) in 2019. The downward trend is similar at night, with Anand Vihar, Civil Lines, Punjabi Bagh and even Mandir Marg showing a reduction in noise levels over the years. While the decibel level in Punjabi Bagh dropped from 58.9 dB(A) in 2015 to 52.2 dB(A) in 2019, the fall is around 3 decibels at Civil Lines and 1-1.5 decibels at Anand Vihar and Mandir Marg. RK Puram, meanwhile, actually showed a gradual increase in night noise level, with the annual average in 2015 of 53.7 dB(A) going up to 56 dB(A) in 2019 and 56.9 in 2020 despite the lockdown curbing noise pollution. Among the 26 noise stations, Karol Bagh recorded the highest daytime average noise levels in 2020 at 71.8 dB(A), followed by Dwarka at 64.2 dB(A). At night, Shahdara was the noisiest in 2020 at 64.6 dB(A), followed by Karol Bagh at 61 dB(A) and Narela at 59.3 dB(A). At night, the least noisy place in Delhi was Najafgarh with a measure of 49.3 dB(A), followed closely by Alipur at 49.5 dB(A). The positions were reversed during the day, with Alipur the least noisy location in Delhi at 51.6 dB(A), followed by Najafgarh at 52.5 dB(A). While vehicular traffic may largely be the reason for high noise levels at RK Puram, DPCC officials were unable to explain the increase in noise pollution over the years. “We analyse the data and based on this information, we carry out periodical checks in such locations to identify noise level violations,” said one official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-is-less-noisy-but-for-rk-puram/articleshow/81520010.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Maid who robbed doctor after sedating her held||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A house maid who gave sedatives to a woman doctor and frequently stole money and gold ornaments from the house was arrested by Medical College police on Monday. The arrested woman was identified as Ranjana Thomas, 44, of Pathanamthitta. The woman doctor approached the police saying that she suspected her house maid of giving her sedatives and often stealing money from the house. The police began tracking the woman and she was arrested from her rented house at Jawahar Nagar. The doctor is staying along with her daughter, a student of dental college, at a rented house near the college. She ran a dispensary at Kundara. The police said that whenever the doctor was alone, the house maid would give tea or water spiked with sedatives. The doctor said in her complaint that in her half-conscious state she had seen the maid steal money from the drawer. On Friday, a golden bangle and Rs 1,500 went missing from the house. The doctor reportedly told police that she had ignored previous instances of theft but she was shocked by the manner in which the servant often spiked her tea with sedatives. The police found sedatives in the bag of the servant. Later she was questioned and she admitted to the theft. The woman had pledged the gold ornament in a financial institution and transferred the money to another bank account. The probe is on to find out whether the woman had any criminal history or had accomplices. Medical College SHO Binu Varghese, SI Jayasankar, senior civil police officers Jyothi K Nair, Naufal, Rafeeq, Metilda, Arun and Rajitha were part of the team which arrested the servant. The police recovered the gold ornament from the financial institution.

It was satisfactory and hence, at this point, the existing restrictions will continue. We are close monitoring the developments,” he said. Mandhare, who is the chairperson of the DDMA, held a review meeting with various department heads on Monday. The district-level Emergency Operations Centres (EOC), of which they are a part, has decided to meet more frequently. NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav, Zilla Parishad chief executive officer Leena Bansod were also present for the meeting. Divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game guided the meeting. The DDMA has already announced that all shops and establishments will operate from 7am to 7pm only on weekdays. All the establishments and the even temples will remain closed for the entire day on weekends. Public transportation, however, will not be closed at any point of time. Mandhare said instead of joint teams, all the departments have been asked to carry out random checking to ensure Covid-19-appropriate behaviour. Collector has also asked the respective authorities to open Covid Care Centres, along with the Dedicated Covid Health Centres where required. At the same time, he has asked the health officials to increase the testing in the containment zones. “We will be activating the automated RNA Extraction and automated RT-PCR testing machine at civil hospital in two days. NMC will also open its lab soon and testing will go up by 10,000 samples per day in the district,” Mandhare added. “Since the people in home isolation appear to be violating norms, we are going to take strict against such violations. We are opening up CCCs as well now so violators can be put there – if the situation warrants,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-change-in-curbs-nashik-collector/articleshow/81516516.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Local residents have frequently alerted forest officials about having spotted a leopard in various areas under these panchayats. Forest officials and veterinarians have not been able to gather any confirmatory evidence to say whether the prowling animal in these areas was actually a leopard. A meeting of higher officials was convened on Monday wherein it was decided to install more cameras. “Initially we installed three cameras in these areas. The visuals collected from these cameras couldn’t give us a clear image of the animal. The surveillance network will be widened by installing 6-10 cameras in more areas,” said B Ajith Kumar, range officer, Palode. A few days ago, two goats were found dead in a house at Thalikuzhy in Pulimathu panchayat. Postmortem revealed that the abdominal portion was ripped apart and visceral organs were consumed. There were also attempts to drag the goats from the open cage which was typical of a predatory attack. While CCTV visuals from forest department cameras did not give any instance of a leopard attack, the residents reported that a leopard was found at a roadside shop that sold garden sculptures. The visuals collected from the shop show an animal on the move but again officials said that the paw marks found in this shop belonged to a canine and not to a feline, like leopard. The visuals showed that the animal prowled around the shop for nearly two hours and it killed a Turkey bird in the shop. The animal was also found having water from a fountain. Two youths have also reported leopard sightings. Forest officials installed a cage in one of the areas where the animal was sighted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/leopard-scare-more-cctv-cameras-to-be-installed/articleshow/81518412.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||No coercive action in fake followers case: Punjab and Haryana HC||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has restrained Mumbai police from taking any coercive action against Shabir Momin-MD, One Digital Entertainment Private Limited, in connection with a case of creating fake followers on social media. Momin’s company primarily works as a digital content distributor. Momin, a resident of Gurgaon in Haryana was initially summoned by controversial Mumbai cop, Sachin Waze in August last year. Subsequently, Waze was shifted from the branch after which another cop, inspector Santosh Kotwal of the special investigation team of CID, Mumbai police summoned Momin. Aggrieved, Momin approached Punjab and Haryana high court. According to Momin, an FIR was registered in July 2020 for cheating, forgery and under the IT Act at the instance of certain artists. Allegations which emerged during the police probe revealed that a racket was going on to create crores of fake identities on various social media platforms, and thereby producing fake performance statistics such as followers, comments, and views. This, according to the probe, was done to inflate influencers’ performance statistics. Neither Momin, nor his company was named as an accused in the FIR. Aggrieved from the notice received from Mumbai police, Momin, 43, filed a petition before the Punjab and Haryana high court through his counsel Sumeet Goel submitting that notices issued to him amounted to abuse of power. It was stated that earlier notices, issued by Mumbai police under Sections 91 and 160 CrPc, were duly responded to and the documents called upon by the police were duly furnished. Advocate Goel informed that still, notice dated January 21, 2021 was issued to Momin reciting that the previous notice dated September 7, 2020 under Section 91 CrPc has not been responded to inasmuch as the requisite documents have not been produced. On February 25 this year, the HC issued notice to Mumbai police seeking their response on Momin’s contentions. When the matter came up for hearing before the HC on Monday, the court was informed that despite serving notice to Mumbai police through e-mail, no reply has been filed by Mumbai police. On this, Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa restrained Mumbai police from taking action against the petition in this case. He also asked the counsel for the petitioner to send the record pertaining to the petition to the Mumbai police, including commissioner, crime intelligence unit, Mumbai police and inspector Santosh Kotwal through registered post, seeking their response. The matter has now been adjourned for June 29 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-stops-mumbai-police-from-taking-coercive-action-in-fake-digital-followers-case/articleshow/81519855.cms||Ajay Sura

Later, his team came and made enquiries about my business and asked if I had all the requisite permission.” It is suspected that the fake number plates seized by the investigators from the SUV may have been made here, but Talreja denied it and maintained that all his records were taken by Waze. “We get orders from all nearby shops, including Hiran’s. We used to maintain the record of every number plate made, but Waze took the record book and CCTV camera’s DVR,” Talreja claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cop-took-dvr-records-number-plate-shop-owner/articleshow/81519938.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

Earlier on March 10 and 11, 12 students of the boarding school had tested positive for Covid-19. These students had come from other states. The clarification comes after the rumours led parents of the students making frantic calls to the management of the institution. “There is no lockdown in the school campus and only the school infirmary – where Covid-19-positive students have been isolated — has been declared as a micro containment zone. The rumours claiming that the entire school is under lockdown are baseless and false,” said Brother Joseph. He added that the infected students are asymptomatic and are in good health. “We are following all Covid-19 protocols and all students are safe and healthy. Please do not pay heed to baseless rumours,” Brother Joseph added. On Sunday evening, the district administration had also dismissed all such rumours while urging people to not spread unverified news. Speaking to TOI, sub-divisional magistrate Manish Kumar had said, “The situation is under control and there are no plans to cordon off the school campus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/reports-of-school-being-turned-into-containment-zone-baseless-st-georges-college-principal/articleshow/81517474.cms||Anmol Jain

The carcass was over two days old. Infighting with a tiger is suspected to be the cause of death. A probe has been ordered by Pawan Kumar Sharma, chief wildlife warden of UP. A report is expected in 10 days. Naveen Khandelwal, deputy director of PTR, said four tiger cubs, around two months old, had been spotted near the carcass. But no efforts were made to rescue the cubs, putting their lives in danger from other carnivores and poachers. The carcass has been sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute at Bareilly for an autopsy. Chief conservator of forest (CCF), Bareilly zone, Lalit Verma and the Bareilly-based officiating field director of PTR Javed Akhtar, rushed to the spot on Monday morning to review the situation. Preliminary assessment suggests that the tigress may have died of infighting with a tiger in a bid to protect its cubs, said CCF Verma. “Maggots had infested its wounds on the trachea. The actual facts will be disclosed only by the autopsy report,” he added. Asked why the cubs were not rescued, Verma said, “We were not sure whether the dead tigress was their mother.” To ascertain this, 25 camera traps have been installed near the spot. “If we get pictures of the cubs with another tigress, there will be no need for their rescue or else they will be searched and rescued. The forest teams have already embarked on an intensive search,” the CCF added. Surprised over the CCF’s statement, former member of the Uttarakhand state wildlife board Kaushalendra Singh said since the cubs were spotted near the carcass of the tigress, it was evident that they were its offspring and should have been rescued immediately. “Can the two-month-old cubs survive till the department decides who is their mother? They will die of starvation by that time or will be killed by some carnivore,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/tigress-found-dead-in-ptr-infighting-may-be-cause-of-death/articleshow/81515905.cms||Keshav Agarwal

The party on Monday said AMMK leader T T V Dhinakaran was the chief minister candidate for the AMMK-DMDK alliance. The DMDK was allocated 60 seats by AMMK after it walked walked out of the AIADMK-led alliance last week. Premalatha said the DMDK, from the beginning, had been urging the AIADMK to commence seat sharing talks with the allies but the ruling party delayed the process with the DMDK. “Annan Edappadiyar (Brother Edappadi K Palaniswami) says we (the DMDK) are immature. But Amma (Jayalalithaa) had struck an alliance with the DMDK, even cancelling her campaign for Captain (Vijayakanth), and offered 41 seats for us and we helped the alliance emerge victorious. Edappadiyar has no such maturity,” she said. The DMDK demanded 41 seats and came down to 18 seats and a Rajya Sabha seat, however, the AIADMK stood firm in its offer of 13 seats. “The CM was not forthcoming to share even the names of constituencies. He insisted the DMDK to sign the poll pact for a number of seats first,” Premalatha alleged. After the DMDK quit the alliance, Dhinakaran reached out to the party to cement an alliance, said Premalatha. Vridhachalam constituency is back in the limelight again after a gap of 15 years. DMDK cadres at Vridhachalam in Cuddalore district rejoiced the announcement of the party treasurer Premalatha Vijayakanth as the candidate for their constituency for the forthcoming assembly poll.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/tamil-nadu/eps-is-immature-says-dmdk-leader-premalatha/articleshow/81519952.cms||---

Apart from asking parents to clear fee dues to release report cards, they are even asking them to buy books and uniforms before classes start. “The school will reopen on March 22 at 8.30am for students of class 1, 2, and 3, who have been promoted to the next class. The book sets will be made available online on March 18 for students of class 2 and 3, and on March 19 for students of class 4,” read a circular from a school in Habsiguda, adding that the link for online payment for book set will be shared with parents only after fee dues are cleared till February 2021. Parents were also asked to pay the first term fee for 2021-22 by April 10. Similar messages were shared by managements of other schools informing parents about being able to see report cards of their wards only if they clear dues. “If the fee is not cleared results will be withheld,” read a message from a Secunderabad school . Parents said that they were shocked to see these circulars and messages. “I don’t understand who permitted them to start physical classes for students as young as six or seven. They are strong-arming parents into clearing dues and buying books, uniforms,” said a parent of a class 2 student. Teachers, meanwhile, said that many small schools, located in the outskirts or inside residential colonies, have already started classes for younger kids. Members of Telangana Recognized School Managements Association said managements are running schools in places where parents are willing to send their wards for classes.  “About 10% of schools in the Telangana are conducting physical classes for class 1 to class 5 students,” said Shekar Rao Y, president, TRSMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/without-nod-some-schools-set-to-bring-class-2-kids-back/articleshow/81518453.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Seven Covid patients had been admitted to the hospital by Monday night.An out-patient department (OPD) for non-Covid patients has been started in a vacant CBD school. Non-Covid patients who need hospitalisation are being referred to NMC’s Bytco hospital in Nashik Road or to the Nashik civil hospital.Jayshree Natesh, the superintendent of the hospital, said the positivity rate is increasing everywhere. There is a possibility that the scenario would replicate in Deolali camp and its surrounding villages as well. A large number of patients from the surrounding villages also come to the cantonment board hospital for treatment. If the Covid patients do not have proper isolation facilities at their homes, there is a possibility that such patients would end up spreading the infection. Therefore, the hospital has been converted into a DCHC for institutional quarantine of such patients, said Natesh. The cantonment hospital was first converted into a DCHC in May 2020. It continued to function as a DCHC until the first week of February as the Covid cases continued to drop in the Deolali Camp area and its surroundings. However, after the recent surge in Covid cases across the district, the CBD hospital has been converted again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/deolali-cantt-board-hospital-converted-into-dchc-again/articleshow/81516564.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Pune||Cabbie turned mask seller looks at new biz option to send daughter to school again||Pune: Around this time last year, 37-year-old Kailas Autade was a cab driver worried about the novel coronavirus that had hit the city, resulting in the increasing number of cases. A year since, Kailas, became a mask seller, is now looking at a new business opportunity with only one thing in mind—to get his five-year-old daughter back to school again. “The school in Shaniwar Peth, where my daughter studied, dropped her name as I was unable to pay up the fees in August, last year. It has been almost a year since the first lockdown was announced in Pune and I can’t help but think of the way our lives have spiraled down. From earning between Rs22,000 to Rs25,000 a month, I am now earning less than Rs500 a day now. The last year has shown me how tough life can be, but has also taught me of ways to survive. My only aim at present is to ensure that this year my daughter gets admission in a school again. This has not let me to slow down and give up,”Autade, who continues to sell face masks now at a corner on Sinhagad Road said. Once the first lockdown was announced in the last week of March last year, Kailas’ cab business came to a halt. He then started selling vegetables for a few months. But, when the profits became thinner owing to a sudden surge in the number of vegetable vendors, he switched and took up the job of a mask seller. “The first time I felt I had hit rock bottom was when I got flogged by the cops for selling masks. The administration, last year, had given a relaxation in the curfew from 10am to 2pm. I remember, around 12.30pm, a group of police officers arrived and beat me with sticks for being outside. I couldn’t provide any explanation to them as they wouldn’t listen.”He said he didn’t have money to pay his daughter’s school fees and despite requests, the school didn’t listen and removed her name from the rolls. “I am planning to switch again to a different business, so that I can earn more money and get her admitted in a school. I am also looking to get her admitted under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. She would have been promoted to Standard II if her education had continued. Now, she will be losing one year, but it is better than not having an education at all,” he said. On being asked about his plans if the state government decided to announce another lockdown in wake of the recent spike in Covid-19 cases, Autade said he was scared. “If that happens, I will be forced to take extreme steps. My family will not be able to recover again. The government should think about people like us before planning lockdowns. Restrictions are okay and necessary too, but the lockdown isn’t the answer or an option. At present, I am only concentrating on getting my daughter admitted in school again and finding a new business as selling masks isn’t really helping,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cabbie-turned-mask-seller-looks-at-new-biz-option-to-send-daughter-to-school-again/articleshow/81519372.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Kochi||Baby at risk if pregnant mom gets Covid||KOCHI: A pregnant woman’s exposure to Covid-19 can potentially increase the risk of her newborn getting multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) — in which some of the organs and tissues such as the heart, lungs, blood vessels, kidneys, digestive system, brain, skin or eyes — become severely inflamed. If untreated, MIS-C could result in permanent damage or even death. MIS-C is a new disease found in the past few months in children who develop complications a few weeks after being exposed to Covid-19. But MIS-C was not known to occur in newborns, till doctors at Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS), Kochi, came across a 24-day-old baby in the last week of December 2020. The baby had a heart failure, with the heart’s pumping efficiency barely 10% and multiorgan dysfunction. With most common causes of such illness ruled out, the treating doctors were puzzled as to why the baby was so ill. That’s when they found that the baby’s mother had Covid when she was about 31 weeks pregnant. But there were no fetal complications during the illness and the mother was RT-PCR-negative at delivery. But this made the doctors think of a possible connection between the mother’s past Covid infection and the baby’s current illness. With little data on the effect of Covid on the maternal-fetal dyad, this case study from a hospital in Kochi published in The Lancet (probably first case of neonatal from India to be published in a medical journal) is key to understanding the effects of Covid-19 in a neonate following in-utero exposure. “Globally, pregnant women are becoming more vulnerable to Covid-19 exposure due to relaxation in restrictions and setting in of pandemic fatigue. At such a time, this case might have important implications for healthcare professionals looking after peripartum women and their neonates, and for postnatal counselling and care of infants born with antenatal exposure to Covid,” said Dr Mahesh Kappanayil, professor, pediatric cardiology, AIMS, and lead author of the paper. Once MIS-C was identified, the baby was put on immunomodulatory therapy and her condition improved. “If unrecognized and not treated on time, then the disease can progress very fast, leading to death. But in this case as we realized the possibility of post-Covid MIS-C, the child was treated with immunomodulatory therapy and in 24 hours the condition improved. The baby is now a lot better and we are hoping that she should be able to lead a normal life,” said Dr Suma Balan, pediatric rheumatologist, AIMS, and co-author of the paper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/baby-at-risk-if-pregnant-mom-gets-covid/articleshow/81517481.cms||Preetu Nair

Kanhuraj Bagate, SSST CEO, said the decision has come into force from Monday and was taken owing to the rising levels of mercury. “During the months of March, April and May the day temperature soars and standing in queue for passes could have adverse health effects on the devotees. There have been instances in the past where devotees in queues at pass centres faced issues due to heat. Hence, we have decided to keep these centres closed for five hours every day,” Bagate said. “However, those who have opted for online free and paid passes with a time slot between 11:30am and 4pm will be allowed to visit the temple. Darshan will not be stopped for those who have authorised passes during that period. Ever since the Sai temple was re-opened from November 16 last year, the temple management had announced online booking of free and paid passes by visiting its official website, www.online.sai.org.in. However since a section of devotees reach Shirdi without online booking of passes, the management had started six pass centres where on the spot passes are being distributed. These centres remain closed on Thursdays, weekends and on holidays since there rush on these days at these centres are huge and there are high chances of Covid safety rule violations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/shirdi-pass-centres-to-shut-from-11-30am-to-4pm/articleshow/81516575.cms||---

He is banking on the mukkulathor (thevar) community, a dominant caste group in the region to which he and his aunt V K Sasikala belong. In fact, in Kayathar, one of the two panchayat unions in Kovilpatti, 13 of the AMMK councillors were elected on independent symbols in the 2019 local body polls. The AIADMK and the DMK won one and two seats respectively in the union. The Dhinakaran camp was keen on Kovilpatti for more than one reason. The popularity of the AMMK could be gauged from the fact that the party candidate for Tuticorin LS seat N Bhuvaneswaran, polled 7.79% votes on the ‘gift pack’ symbol when Sasikala was in prison. This includes 19,478 votes in Kovilpatti assembly segment, the highest votes the party secured in the Parliamentary constituency. “TTV will win with a huge margin given the goodwill he earned from the locals. It is our duty to ensure his success and send him to the legislature,” said S V S P Manickaraja, TTV’s close associate and chairman of the Kayathar panchayat union for two decades. Party sources say it was Manickaraja, who persuaded Dhinakaran to contest from Kovilpatti, now considered an AMMK bastion. Dhinakaran is pitted against AIADMK minister Kadambur Raju. Despite announcing his plan to contest in two constituencies, including R K Nagar, Dhinakaran did not make his Kovilpatti plan known even to his supporters until the last minute. Incidentally, the AMMK won the home ward of Kadambur Raju in the local body election. But Raju reposes faith in his popularity to secure a third-straight win. Other than mukkulathor, the other dominant castes include, naicker, nadar, reddiar, Muslims and SC. “TTV could have easily contested in Usilampatti, Andipatti, Melur or Mudukulathur, where mukkulathors are dominant. But he chose Kovilpatti for the goodwill he earned from the locals. He will change the political dynamics of the state from Kovilpatti,” said a senior AMMK leader. Dhinakaran was one among the first to reach out to the victims of Tuticorin police firing in 2018 which claimed 15 lives. Sasikala’s decision to withdraw from politics may have upset partymen. But the AMMK alliance strengthened by Vijayakanth’s DMDK and Asaddudin Owaisi’s AIMIM has lifted morale of TTV supporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/tamil-nadu/backing-from-community-local-goodwill-pushed-t-t-v-to-choose-kovilpatti/articleshow/81520016.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Kochi||Veteran Kathakali maestro Chemancheri dies at 105||Kozhikode: Kathakali maestro Guru Chemancheri Kunhiraman Nair, one of the oldest practitioners of the ancient dance drama art form of Kerala, died following old age-related ailments at his residence near Cheliya in Koyilandy early Monday morning. He was 105. Nair was honoured with Padma Shri in 2017 in recognition for his role in promoting classical dance forms, including Kathakali. Age didn’t come in the way for Nair to pursue his passion for Kathakali, and he had awed the audience by staging Kathakali even at around 100 years of age. He was one of the foremost teachers of classical dances in North Kerala and trained hundreds of students. An exponent of the Kalladikodan school of Kathakali, popular in the northern districts of the state, his portrayal of Krishna roles had earned much applause. Nair exuded a special charm while staging Krishna’s role, and he had performed more than 1,000 times as Krishna in different compositions. On what kept him going in his eight-decades-old tryst with the classical art, he had said that he derived a peculiar energy while donning characters on stage and that ‘divine’ energy helped him tide over the misfortunes of life and carry on with the pursuit of excellence in Kathakali. Condoling the demise, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that Nair’s passion towards Indian culture and spirituality was legendary. “He made exceptional efforts to groom upcoming talent in our classical dances,” Modi tweeted. Born in 1916 to Madankandi Chathukutty Nair and Ammukutty Amma, Nair started learning Kathakali at a very young age. His mother died when he was only three years old and at the age of 13, he lost his father. The passion for the art form made him leave his house in Cheliya and approach Palayil Karunakara Menon for training in Kathakali. He was also trained in Bharatanatyam and other dance forms like Kerala Nadanam. Nair has trained hundreds of students, including film stars, in various classical dance forms. Bharatiya Natyakalalayam, which he founded in 1945, was the first school of dance in north Kerala. He also started the Pookkad Kalalayam in 1977 along with Sukumaran Bhagavathar. In 1983, he established Cheliya Kathakali Vidyalayam, exclusively for Kathakali training, in his native village. Many of his disciples have gone on to become noted dance teachers themselves. Nair’s mortal remains were kept for public homage at Koyilandy Town Hall and at Cheliya Kathakali Vidyalayam and Pookkad Kalalayam. The funeral was held at his house in Cheliya in the afternoon with state honours. In his condolence message, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that Nair had created wonders in the realm of Kathakali through his talent and dedication to the art form. “No other person has put in as much effort as he did to enable children to develop a sense of appreciation for Kathakali. Guru is also unmatched in the number of disciples,” Pinarayi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/veteran-kathakali-maestro-chemancheri-dies-at-105/articleshow/81517488.cms||---

After its consumption, three people — Manoj Kumar (24), his father Rishipal Singh and Raj Kumar (30) — had died the next day while three others are undergoing treatment. A village pradhan candidate was also arrested. Illicit liquor was distributed by smugglers on Maha Shivratri in Simrai village under Gunnaur police station limits and was being consumed in high quantities, and yet, no action was taken by the local police. Consequently, Bairpur outpost in-charge and two constables were suspended on Sunday. A probe is also ordered against SHO Gunnaur in the matter, said Sambhal police. Sambhal SP Chakresh Mishra said, “An investigation into the death of three people in Sambhal revealed that smugglers had distributed liquor mixed with chemicals in large quantities. The same was consumed by villagers on Maha Shivratri, following which six people were taken ill and admitted in a hospital in a critical state. Three of them had succumbed the next day. It has come to light that no action was taken by the local police. The role of SHO Gunnaur police station, Sanjeev Kumar is also suspicious.” “Bairpur outpost in-charge Pankaj Baliyan and two constables Madan Pal Singh and Geetam Chaudhary have been suspended. ASP Alok Jaiswal will be further investigating the case. A candidate for village pradhan post, Kalyan Singh, involved in providing illicit liquor to villagers has been arrested.

The virtual learning through these classes can continue, an official release said quoting AMC administrator Astik Kumar Pandey. Notably, private coaching classes for all standards, except Std X and Std XII were already suspended in Aurangabad. The coaching classes violating the ban on operations on classroom teaching would face action. While parents have given cautious reactions to the fresh ban on private coaching, the association of such institutes has said the move is uncalled for. Arati Thigale, whose daughter is a standard XII student, said the safety of the students is paramount especially when the board examinations are round the corner. “The teaching of the syllabus is already over in schools and private classes. The practice tests or revision of syllabus can be undertaken online also,” she said. Pandurang Mandkikar, head of the private coaching classes association, said the institutes were not taken into confidence while imposing the blanket closure. “We can understand a ban on our activities during the weekend, when stricter curbs are in force. Private coaching classes have become a soft target for the government authorities without paying attention to the fact that students benefiting from it get directly impacted,” he said. Paithan fair postponed The annual fair held at Paithan on the occasion of Eknath-Shashti, falling on April 2, has been postponed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/physical-coaching-classes-for-std-x-xii-suspended/articleshow/81516583.cms||---

Two places in Bengaluru and one in Delhi were also raided. The searches were held with the assistance of local police units. The NIA said the searches were preceded by extensive verification conducted jointly by itself, the Delhi police, and Kerala police ATS. “The group of radicalised individuals under the leadership of Mohammed Ameen, alias Abu Yahya, owing allegiance to proscribed terrorist organisation IS, had identified certain individuals in Kerala and Karnataka for targeted killing. They had also planned to undertake hijrat (religious migration) to J&K to engage in terrorist acts, the NIA claimed in a statement. “Ameen had travelled to J&K immediately after his return to India from Bahrain in March 2020 and had been camping in Delhi for the last two months to establish connections with J&K-based operatives having allegiance to IS,” the NIA statement claimed. The NIA statement claimed this group had been running various ISIS propaganda channels on different social media platforms, including Telegram, Hoop and Instagram, to propagate violent jihadi ideology and radicalise and recruit new members to this ISIS module.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nia-conducts-searches-at-eight-locations-in-state/articleshow/81517490.cms||---

Sources said the woman, after being in a relationship for three years, went to her boyfriend’s house to convince him for marriage, but he turned down her proposal. The woman then allegedly took the extreme step. She was rushed to CHC in Tanda in a critical state and later succumbed. Rampur SP Shogun Gautam said, “The woman had consumed poison after she was refused by her alleged 'lover' for marriage, on Sunday. The woman's family has alleged that she was given poison and murdered. After a complaint, an FIR has been registered against two accused persons under section 302 (punishment for murder) of IPC.” Notably, last year, the woman had accused her boyfriend of raping her on promise of marriage. She had also lodged a complaint with Rampur police that her lover’s elder brother had sexually assaulted her when she had gone to meet her boyfriend. An FIR under rape was registered against both the accused persons in June 2020. Family alleged that Rampur police, influenced by the political background of the accused, had said that no evidence of rape was found and a final report was registered in the case in September. The family had challenged the FR (final report) in district court and a hearing in the matter was due next month. A copy of the FIR registered against the accused persons in June 2020 and the woman’s statement of 164 which was recorded then, is with TOI. The woman’s father alleged, “The accused had been sexually assaulting my daughter on promise of marriage while his elder brother had also raped her. After this, an FIR was registered under various IPC sections, including rape. Since the matter is in court and the accused feared they may land up in jail, they played a trick with my daughter. They called her saying that the younger brother will marry her once she compromises in the case. She was murdered.” Police, meanwhile, maintained that no evidence of rape was found in the case, so far. “The woman’s family initially said that she killed herself. They later changed their statement and said she was given poison and killed by her boyfriend. Now, we have registered FIR under IPC section 302. Three teams have been formed. The accused will soon be arrested. The woman’s body has been sent for postmortem,” the SP (City) added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/boyfriend-turns-down-marriage-woman-ends-life-outside-house/articleshow/81515911.cms||Maria Khan

The schools have yet to switch to offline mode and with Covid cases rising, the director of secondary education, Dattatray Jagtap, said the continuous and comprehensive evaluation during the year will be considered to assess students considering the current situation and lockdown in many cities of Maharashtra. Jagtap said there is a no-fail policy for standards I to VIII which would continue and grades would be given based on their year-long performance. Last year, the administration had decided to shut schools around March 18 and online education began. Many private schools decided to promote the students based on their performance during the year. However, the new academic year was completely online except for two months of offline classes for standard IX and XII and one month of offline classes for standards V to VIII. Jagtap said, “With the situation uncertain and the academic year coming to an end, we are doubtful if the offline classes or exams for all the standards would be possible. We are also waiting for government instructions on the Covid restrictions which are getting stricter by the day with a spike in cases. Hence, in most likelihood, the exams may not happen and students will be promoted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/promotion-sans-final-exams-likely-from-standards-i-viii/articleshow/81518544.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

I do not foresee a need for a lockdown at the moment even if the number of fresh cases is on the rise. A wholehearted cooperation from citizens, however, is a must to avoid stringent curbs in the near future,” he told the media. Chavan added that all restaurants, hotels and bars would be allowed to offer only parcel services between March 17 and April 4. “Even though hotels, restaurants and bars are operating with 50% seating capacity, the dining facilities have been found to be a major source of transmission of the novel coronavirus. Therefore, these establishments are allowed to offer only parcel services during this second wave of the pandemic,” he said. Earlier, Chavan, who held a review meeting with different government departments, issued instructions to improve the contact tracing ratio of positive patients. “Apart from the municipal limits, the spread of Covid-19 is on the rise in rural areas too. Local self-governing bodies in the rural areas and all officials and public representatives must make efforts to ensure effective contact tracing in the villages,” he said. On Sunday, Aurangabad had reported the highest single-day rise in Covid cases since the pandemic broke out almost ayear ago. The district had reported 1,023 fresh cases on Sunday — 793 in the Aurangabad municipal limits and 230 in the rural areas of the district. Aurangabad district also reported five deaths on Sunday, including that of one 39-year-old man from the Gangapur taluka, show official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-collector-no-need-of-lockdown-citizens-must-cooperate/articleshow/81516592.cms||---

A team of doctors from Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) are helping the police line for the same. According to information, so far, out of 4,200 police personnel of Ludhiana commissionerate, 3,040 have got the first dose of vaccination. Besides, Till March 10, 400 have got the second dose of vaccination. Joint commissioner of police, headquarter, J Elanchezihan, said, “From March 10 onwards, we have started giving vaccination at police lines itself. A team of doctors from DMCH are conducting the vaccination drive. We have taken this initiative to make the process hassle free and more approachable. Earlier, police personnel used to visit hospitals for the vaccine.” “However, now, they visit the police line and after checking their medical history they are given vaccination and are kept under observationm,” added JCP Elanchezian. Further the JCP said the Ludhiana city police are also giving facility to the family members of the police personnel to get the jab at police lines. “Several police personnel live inside the police lines. We have allowed the family members of police personnel, above the age of 65 years and above the age of 45 years with comorbidities, to get the free vaccination at the police line,” he added.

---||Hyderabad||MLM firms exploit direct selling norms, resort to chain marketing||Hyderabad: A woman introduced a man from Karimnagar to a multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme. As the man failed to get the promised commission, he asked her to return the money. Result: She lodged a police complaint alleging he was stalking her. A case was booked against him recently. Police said MLM schemes were straining ties between friends and family members. Whenever police bust an MLM racket in Telangana and arrest its organisers on the charge of violation of the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Scheme (Banning) Act, 1978, the counter argument which comes to the fore from representatives of these companies is their business model is legitimate as it is direct selling, permitted by the Telangana Direct Selling Guidelines, 2017. In several cases registered in the last few years, police found companies, on the pretext of direct selling, followed the pyramid model, where in a customer pays money to enrol himself/herself as a distributor of products. Later, the customer should enrol more people and the chain continues. However, senior police officers claim chain marketing or pyramid model was not only a violation of the Prize Chits & Money Circulation Schemes (Banning Act), but also violates the direct selling guidelines, which prohibit chain marketing. In the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Scheme (Banning) Act, 1978, the Union government had authorised police and other agencies to implement it. After big MLM companies exerted pressure, the Union consumers affairs ministry had issued guidelines for implementation in 2017. After the notification, MLM companies claimed legitimacy for their businesses, creating more confusion. However, investigators told TOI that direct selling guidelines had clearly barred pyramid model and MLM. The industries department was given the role to supervise implementations of the guidelines. “Always, it is a law which has precedence over guidelines. MLM is a violation of the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Scheme (Banning) Act, 1978, and the same was confirmed by the Supreme Court in the Kuriachan Chacko Vs State of Kerala verdict in 2008 and a few other judgements,” Cyberabad police commissioner VC Sajjanar told TOI. Telangana Water Resource Development Corporation (TWRDC) chairman and TRS leader V Prakash Rao, who has been an open supporter of MLM business and even participated in several meetings both at the Centre and state-level at the behest of MLM companies, agreed that over 90% existing MLM companies violate direct selling guidelines. Rao said as of now there were over 250 MLM companies of which just 25 were recognised by Indian Direct Selling Association (IDSA) as their business model qualifies under direct selling guidelines. “The consumer affairs ministry amended the relevant law in 2018, but till now the Union government did not frame rules,” said Prakash Rao. “Even after rules are framed, if any MLM company collects registration fee and imposes products on customers, it will be illegal. Authorities must clear air over recognized and unrecognized MLM companies. Calling all MLM companies illegal is not correct.” Rao told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mlm-firms-exploit-direct-selling-norms-resort-to-chain-marketing/articleshow/81518532.cms||Srinath Vudali

The number of cases that peaked up to 2,462 cases in October last year that was 1.04% of the total affected in the state till then, dropped to 1,004 cases (0.60% of the total affected) in January and then to 693 cases (0.53%) in February. The daily trend from March 1 to 8 shows that the numbers are dropping steeply. From June 1 last year till March 8 this year, 9,363 members of the force have been hit by Covid-19, that comes to 0.87% of the total affected in the state. “We have successfully been able to reduce the Covid-19 cases in the force by strictly following Covid-19 protocols . Even the latest training of newly-inducted members has been conducted by adhering to the Covid-19 protocol,” said ADGP (battalion) K Padmakumar, who is also the nodal officer for Covid-19 related matters in the force. As many as five members from the force succumbed to the pandemic . Since the police were given top priority in vaccination, 60,263 police officers have registered for vaccination, of which 34,700 (57.58%) have been vaccinated till March 9. In the state, police have been actively pressed for Covid-19 related enforcement activities along with health department officials. After the initial days of lockdown when the police were deputed for ensuring the lockdown, they were given the task of cluster and containment management duties. They were given more responsibilities after finding that the majority of the affected in the state by the end of July were from primary contacts outside their families. However, the decision was modified later when the number of Covid-19 cases among the police officers began increasing. The police had then decided that no official above 50 years of age should be put on Covid-19 related field duty. The state police chief had also instructed that even if the police officials are below 50 years of age, they should not be put on field duty if they are having comorbidity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sharp-dip-in-cases-among-cops/articleshow/81517495.cms||KP Saikiran

On Friday, the institute signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the South Eastern Railway Hospital that would guide the students and faculty on clinical activities. The upcoming hospital has not been inaugurated yet. PM Modi was supposed to inaugurate the hospital at the 66th convocation of the institute but that reportedly did not happen because of the renaming controversy. Originally planned as an extension of the existing B C Roy Technology Hospital, the superspeciality hospital was renamed as the Syama Prasad Mookerjee Institute of Medical Science and Research by the institute. The alumni, however, has been protesting against this decision. The director of the institute, V K Tewari, said in a social media post that an MoU has been signed with SER Hospital, “to improve academic, research and clinical activities and help MBBS students who will take admission at the proposed medical college.” “SER Hospital will also provide emergency medical services to all patients referred by IIT Kharagpur,” Tewari added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iit-kharagpur-inks-mou-with-railway-hosp-for-med-institute/articleshow/81518546.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The devastating fire on the 13th floor of the building had claimed nine lives six days ago. Cops at Lalbazar said on Monday that they have asked the railways about the names of the architects and designers who had remodelled the building about a year ago. “We want to know about those who had executed the remodelling of the building so that their statements can be recorded,” said a police officer. The seven-member probe team has also asked railways to share with them the specific changes that they wish to make in the building to avoid any such fire incident there in the future. The forensic experts backed the police probe. “We are collecting a lot of information as part of the probe before we submit the final report,” said a source. The forensic experts said they have also asked the police to ascertain whether there were more electrical equipment on the floor than what the electrical line could have supported. “However, it is difficult to ascertain the load at each floor. As of now we are not blaming the railways for anything. We are looking into all the possibilities to find whether there was any negligence on the part of anyone,” said an expert. Earlier, the fire brigade and forensic experts had advised the railways on certain safety precautions, including lift operations. “They have agreed to a few of our proposals and we hope those will be incorporated soon," said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-koilaghat-bldg-fire-cops-seek-expert-help/articleshow/81518563.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Coimbatore||Apparel units go on strike against rise in yarn prices||Coimbatore: More than 300 apparel manufacturers and exporters shut down their units on Monday to protest against the increasing yarn prices.The manufacturers said that the price of yarn, which is over Rs 300/kg now, has seen an increase of Rs 65 since December. “Most of the spinning mills manufacturing yarn are exporting it. We want the Union government to ban yarn export and regulate yarn prices,” said R Sakthivel, coordinator of Tirupur Exporters Forum. After conducting a demonstration, the exporters met the Tirupur collector and submitted a memorandum.There are more than 350 garment export units in Tirupur employing 16 lakh people. The units supply to brands and buyers in Europe, which has a free trade agreement with countries like Vietnam and Cambodia, thus enjoying no import duty when buying from them. “We are already at a disadvantage because of the import duty they bear when buying from us. Now, to be profitable, we need to increase our prices by 15%, which no buyer will agree to,” said Sakthivel. “Most of our buyers have been hit hard by Covid-19.”The impact of the yarn price hike will be stark in Tirupur when all units shut down either with no orders or inability to execute orders, said Sakthivel. “Our buyers will simply move to Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia, which have large vertical mills, and buy garments from them, because they are cheaper. Once one buyer moves, others will follow and once they move, bringing them back to India will be impossible.”The protest affected production worth Rs 150 crore, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/apparel-units-go-on-strike-against-rise-in-yarn-prices/articleshow/81520051.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Joint rally by trade unions, Samyukta Kisan Morcha against privatisation||Ludhiana: A massive rally was held outside the railway station at Ludhiana on Monday jointly by Central Trade Unions (CTU) and Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM). The rally was attended by a large number of leaders and workers of ATC, INTAC, CITU, CTU and SKM. The spokespersons said with the new agriculture laws, the agriculture sector would be fully controlled by the corporate sector who would be allowed to hoard agricultural produce unlimited. As a result, food prices will skyrocket in the near future, which will have a adverse impact on the weaker and middle classes of the society, they added. India is already ranked 102 out of 117 in terms of hunger index and the situation will get worse, they said. The spokespersons further said the government has started selling to the public sector companies at rock bottom prices and is privatising everything to the corporate sector. Privatisation of banks will be very fatal for the country's economy. “The government intends to hand over the banks to the corporate sector, which has eaten up more than Rs 13 lakh crore of public deposits and has been forgiven by the government. On the other hand, subsidies for the common man are being abolished, which has affected the price of petrol, diesel and gas. The peasant movement has shown a way. Under the guise of Corona, the government has deprived the workers of their rights by enacting four negative codes instead of labour laws in the same manner as it has enacted laws for corporate occupation of farmers’ lands. Due to the new education policy, children from weaker sections will be completely deprived of higher education. The same will happen to health services. Therefore, it has become imperative today to oppose these privatisation policies of the government,” they alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/joint-rally-by-trade-unions-samyukta-kisan-morcha-against-privatisation/articleshow/81520042.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The board selected this project and applied for a patent in September 2013. The process takes time, and the hearing was pending. We were granted the patent this February. This is the first patent received by the college,” Mrunalini Jadhav, principal of Sou Venutai Chavan Polytechnic, said.Prathmesh Bhide, Pranay Barshiker, Sumit Mohite and Kalpesh Mendadkar were in their last year when they took up this project with Meenal Majge as their project guide. “So many years have passed that we had almost lost hope of getting the patent,” Bhide said. They have graduated and are working in different fields.Barshikar said the group was looking at alternative ways of generating electricity and came up with this idea. “While testing, we had used bicycles and motorcycles to see if we could generate electricity,” Mohite said.A storage module like an inverter can be fitted to each such speed breaker to store this electricity. The cost of electricity generation and storage per megawatt from speed-breakers will be nearly Rs 1 crore as compared to about Rs 8 crore in thermal or hydropower stations. “The generated electricity can also be stored in batteries and can be further used for various purposes like lighting up the street lamps, providing power to the nearby slums at a low cost among others. The model is also suitable for parking at multiplexes, malls, toll booths and signals,” said the official note from SCVP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/patent-for-power-generating-device-from-speed-breakers/articleshow/81518552.cms||Ardhra Nair

Justice Anu Sivaraman issued the directive after considering a petition filed by Hina Haneefa, a student of University College in Thiruvananthapuram. The court said the fact that NCC Act does not recognize the third gender or that detailed guidelines are to be introduced for the integration of persons of third gender into NCC cannot be a justification for denying entry for the petitioner. Ruling that denial of enrolment to NCC is unsustainable, the court said the petitioner is entitled to participate in the selection process and to be enrolled in NCC if she is successful. It was pointed out by the court that Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 recognizes the right of transgender persons to a life of dignity and prohibits discrimination against them. Provisions of NCC Act cannot preclude the operation of the law on transgender rights, the court said. The court also said the enactment on transgender rights was one intended to give effect to the rights guaranteed to such persons under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 of the Constitution and it has to be borne in mind when considering cases of this nature. A transgender not only has the right to be recognized as a transgender but also a right to self-perceived gender identity as per the enactment, the court noted. Section 6 of NCC Act that allows only males and females to enrol in NCC was challenged by the petitioner. NCC had contended that there is no provision in law allowing entry of transgender persons in NCC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-allows-transgender-woman-to-join-ncc/articleshow/81517510.cms||---

Gambhir, sister of Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira, had been questioned by the central investigating agency earlier. During the questioning, Rujira had reportedly told the officers that she did not have much knowledge about the financial transactions, which her husband and father-in-law were aware of. Following this statement a notice was sent to Ankush and Pawan last week, asking them to turn up at the agency’s Nizam Palace office. “They have appeared before the anti-corruption branch officers at CBI’s Nizam Palace office for interrogation,” said a CBI official. The duo was questioned for nearly seven hours. Meanwhile, artist Suvaprasanna appeared before the Enforcement Directorate after the agency sought some documents from him.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana HC gives GHMC 4 weeks to pull plug on polluting factories||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Monday directed the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) to issue fresh show-cause notices to polluting industrial units in Sastripuram and Tatanagar residential colonies, hear their version and pass orders within the next four weeks. The judges also imposed a blanket embargo on civil courts entertaining any suits by these industries, driving home a strong message that they cannot escape the law with their dilatory tactics. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy pronounced the interim order while hearing a batch of petitions pertaining to industrial units causing pollution. “GHMC lawyers have to inform civil courts about our order as and when such pleas are filed,” the bench said, while ordering the transfer of all such cases to the high court for a comprehensive hearing by the bench. Referring to the charge made by Pushpender Kaur, counsel for a public interest petitioner, that little progress was made ever since the PIL was filed in 2012, the bench verified with the state counsel as to what happened so far. P Krishna Reddy, the counsel for GHMC, said that though they had issued show-cause notices to over 150 units, they later withdrew them on account of court orders. “Some obtained injunction orders, while some have come to the high court which asked us to wait till the lockdown was over,” he said. Reminding him that it was more than six months since the central government had lifted the lockdown in August 2020, the bench directed GHMC to act now by issuing fresh notices and pass orders within the next four weeks. People in the area were hit by air, water, and sound pollution and it was time to move decisively now, the bench said. It was also critical of the electricity department that failed to act on errant industries. When one of the advocates representing the industrial units charged the petitioner with coming to court with ulterior motives, the bench made it clear that it was relying on the report of the member secretary of the State Legal Services Authority, who, after surveying the area, gave the factual account on the harsh realities prevailing in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-gives-ghmc-4-wks-to-pull-plug-on-polluting-factories/articleshow/81521167.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The protesters demand FIR against Bains on whom a woman has levelled charges of rape. Sidhu, along with the complainant and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Gurdeep Singh Gosha sat outside Ludhiana police commissioner office. Notably, the Congress leaders are laying low over the allegations of rape against Bains and its only SAD which has been pursuing the issue. But in a setback for the ruling party, for the first time that a prominent face of party has towed a different line than party’s stand. Speaking to TOI, Sidhu said, “Recently SAD’s Gurdeep Singh Gosha had alleged that Congress is hand-in-glove with MLA Bains and our leaders are afraid of him. Gosh had also alleged that our cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu is protecting Bains, so today I joined the protest to prove our party is not afraid of Bains and we are of the view that if LIP MLA is guilty he should be punished. I met the victim today and I have assured her that if her allegations prove to be true, Congress will not leave any stone unturned to put the guilty behind bars. So, in order to take this to logical conclusion, I have decided to meet police commissioner Rakesh Agarwal tomorrow asking him to conduct a free and fair trial and make the findings public so that everyone knows what is the truth in this case.” Hailing Sidhu, Gosha, who heads party’s Ludhiana youth wing, said “We are thankful to Kulwant Sidhu for taking a stand for the truth and coming to meet the victim today and joining the protest against police and Bains. I think it’s a slap on the face of other Congress leaders, especially the senior ones who have been shielding Bains. It’s very shameful that it has been more than three months now that the poor victim is running pillar to post for justice. But the police, under pressure from ruling party, is not ready to register FIR against Bains, which is direct violation of the law. But from day one, SAD has made it clear that we will do whatever it takes to stand by the victim and get action done against Bains and we will not budge from our stand.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/congs-atam-nagar-incharge-joins-protest-against-lips-bains/articleshow/81520089.cms||Mohit Behl

The FIR is registered under section 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious sentiments of any class by insulting its religion or religious briefs). On Sunday, a prominent local lawyer in the neighbouring Moradabad city had announced a reward for killing Rizvi which had prompted police to file an FIR against him for criminal intimidation. The clerics of prominent Islamic seminary Darul Uloom, Deoband had claimed that the petition seeking removal of 26 verses from the Quran is nothing but an attempt to tarnish the Muslim community's image. The clerics of Dargah Aala Hazrat had also condemned the step of filing PIL and demanded imposition of the National Security Act against Rizvi. Two complaints were also filed against Rizvi in Muzaffarnagar on Sunday while there was massive outrage in several parts of the country.In Lucknow, a call to the ‘Tahaffuz-e-Quran’ (in protection of the Quran) protest was given by Majlis-e-Ulama-e-Hind general secretary Maulana Kalbe Jawad and was attended by both Shia and Sunni clerics, including former All India Muslim Personal Law Board member Maulana Salman Nadwi.Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan told TOI, “Several religious groups came forward protesting against Rizvi and they even alleged that he had given a controversial statement in the media which has hurt the religious sentiments of several members of the community. There could have been law and order issues because of the protests. We have registered the FIR on their complaint and the matter is under investigation. We are trying to contact Rizvi now. Similar FIRs have been registered in Telangana, Kashmir and other states as well. The PIL filed in the apex court is still under consideration and we don’t want to make comments on the same.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/fir-against-former-chairman-of-shia-waqf-board-waseem-rizvi-for-hurting-religious-sentiments/articleshow/81515933.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

During his campaign at Chettimankurichi in the Edappadi assembly segment on Monday, Palaniswami said Stalin had created an illusion that DMK would win in all the 234 seats. “Stalin’s thoughts will not come true at any cost,” he said. “DMK is a corporate company with Stalin as its managing director while Kanimozhi, Udhayanidhi Stalin and Dayanidhi Maran are its board of directors,” he said. By fielding his son Udhayanidhi in this election, Stalin has proved that he is into dynastic politics and not for the welfare of the public, the chief minister said. The DMK chief should visit Edappadi to see the developments the constituency have achieved in the last 10 years, Palaniswami said. He said free electricity has been increased to 1,000 units from 750 units for weavers. “Weavers’ loans up to Rs 1 lakh will be waived off and Rs 5,000 will be given as compensation during the rainy season,” he said, adding that green houses will be allotted to poor weavers and concrete houses to land and houseless weavers if they lived in the city. He said the AIADMK will always work for the people of Tamil Nadu. “With the support of people, the AIADMK will once again form the government after winning in the April 6 assembly election,” he said. The CM also campaigned at Nangavalli, Jalakandapuram and Edappadi. Earlier, he worshipped at Sendraya Perumal temple in Periya Soragai village before starting his campaign in his assembly segment. He also went for the door-to-door campaign for a few metres in the village before starting an open-van campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/eps-challenges-stalin-to-win-in-edappadi-assembly-segment/articleshow/81520077.cms||---

Sanket Goel, associate professor, electrical and electronics engineering (EEE), BITS Pilani, Hyderabad campus, who is working on ‘Digital 3Dprinted Electronic Technology for Space Electronic Packaging Applications’, a project funded by Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), has used fused deposition modeling 3D printer to build circuits, radio-frequency identification antennas, and hydrazine, a chemical released during the launch of a rocket, sensor. “These are highly reliable, low weight, last longer, and can work in extreme weather conditions,” told Goel TOI. Unlike the copper-based printed circuit board, he said the 3D printed ones overcome corrosion and bending. Goel said this is probably the only project in the country, where they are 3D printing devices for space applications. “For sure, we are among the first ones to 3D print electronic devices for space application. Unless new projects have started in the last couple of years, we are the only ones doing this,” he said. He said as it was a project of Isro, and it is hard to tell when and where the circuits would be used. “The 3D printed circuits, antennas might be used as space components in two years or 10 years. As it is confidential, not much information is revealed to us,” he said. Explaining the hydrazine sensor, Goel said: “It is important to monitor the level of hydrazine, a highly toxic chemical component, both during the launch of a rocket and inside the aircraft. The senor is used to monitor the level and alert when it is high so that it can be removed.” He said that while the production cost of circuits, antennas, or sensors might go down when manufactured in bulk in the traditional way, the cost of 3D printing these devices would not change even if thousands of pieces were built at once. “Whether you make one or 1,000, the cost remains the same,” Goel said, adding that it would hardly take a couple of rupees to 3D print these devices and the duration would be about 15 to 30 minutes. Goel, who is the principal investigator on this project, said he and his students were working on this project since 2018 and it was on the verge of completion. He said these devices could also be printed using a metal 3D printer, but it would cost crores of rupees to procure such printers. He said that he is also working with the department of science and technology and DRDO on 3D printing energy harvesters and supercapacitors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/academic-deploys-3d-printing-tech-for-space-projects/articleshow/81518611.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

There are enough proofs to show the changes I brought to Tamil cinema. In a similar way, I would like to assure that I would bring changes to Coimbatore South,’’ he said at the public meeting on Raja Street.“I have come asking for an opportunity to do that,’’ he said. Kamal said that it was time that useless and corrupt people who pose a hurdle to growth of Coimbatore and TN are removed and make way for honest people. “We have to oust the corrupt elements,” he said.Questioning the reason for not improving Coimbatore to the level it deserves, he alleged that the ruling class chose not to spend money for the development of the city. “If they spend money to expand the airport here, then how to invest in Swiss banks?’’ he asked sarcastically.Noting that there were sceptics who say the third front has never won in TN, Kamal said that even AIADMK founder M G Ramachandran was a third front in his maiden election but went on to create history. “Like MGR, we would also probe the ruling class about financial irregularities,” he said, adding that MNM’s duty was to fill the coffers emptied by the ruling party and make Tamil Nadu a one trillion economy.Kamal said that in the 2019 Lok Sabha election they managed to popularize the ‘Torch Light’ symbol within 18 days and garnered lakhs of votes adding that this time the party would reap even more votes. “Torch light is the only weapon in our possession to shed away darkness and bring light,” he said.He also pointed out that MNM was the only party to give an assurance of recalling their party MLAs if they fail to fulfill the promises made.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/kamal-assures-to-raise-the-standard-of-coimbatore/articleshow/81520084.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Arrest illegal, made scapegoat: Habeas corpus plea in Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Suspended police officer Sachin Waze, through his brother Sudhram, on Monday filed a habeas corpus petition in the Bombay high court alleging that his arrest is illegal and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) intends to “target someone else”. The habeas corpus (produce the body) is a plea to direct the NIA to produce Waze before the HC and set him free. The petition claimed that Waze was “made a scapegoat by certain political powers” by using Vimla Hiren, the widow of Mansukh Hiren whose body was found in Kalwa creek days after his Scorpio was found parked suspiciously outside businessman Mukesh Ambani’s residence. NIA’s action “makes it evident that they are acting with malafide intentions and ulterior motives...to tarnish the name, image and reputation of the petitioner’s brother for reasons best known to them,” stated the plea submitted by advocate Sunny Punamiya. Waze’s fundamental rights have been violated and his life may be at risk, the petition claimed, as the officers “can go to any extent to extract an illegal and false confession”. It added that “right before his arrest, Waze had sent a WhatsApp message to his near and dear ones that he may be trapped by his fellow officers and this time he may not survive this ordeal.” “Waze has been wrongfully arrested in violation of the provisions laid down in the Criminal Procedure Code Section and innumerable Supreme Court judgments” The petition said the case filed by Vimla with the anti-terrorism squad on March 7 against unknown persons made “false, frivolous and concocted allegations” against Waze, blaming him for her husband’s death. It added that “surprisingly, the very next day, an FIR was registered by the NIA against unknown persons”. The petition said Waze has no intention of absconding; in fact, he had cooperated with the NIA who interrogated him for 10 hours before arresting him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-arrest-illegal-made-scapegoat-habeas-corpus-plea-in-hc/articleshow/81520109.cms||---

---||Pune||‘Dist needs one more bench with rising consumer cases’||Pune: With a pendency of around 2,000 cases, the district needs at least one more bench for effective handling of consumer litigations, Pune district consumer court president Umesh Jawalikar said. “Pune has two benches of three members each, handling urban and rural matters, respectively, but as per the norm, one bench must handle 500 cases. We need at least one more bench and are working on this aspect,” Jawalikar told TOI during an interaction on the occasion of World Consumer Rights Day on Monday.He said, “The overall number of cases is good as it shows greater awareness among consumers towards exercising their rights.” Jawalikar said the amended Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which came into effect from July 20, 2020, has provided more teeth to consumers vis-à-vis safeguarding and exercising their rights and has opened up new areas like e-commerce services and product liability where they can seek apt redressal.The pecuniary jurisdiction of district consumer courts has gone up from Rs20 lakh to Rs1crore, he said. He said, “Under product liability provisions, the defence that e-commerce platforms are merely ‘platforms’ or ‘aggregators’, no longer holds. Now, the manufacturer or a service provider has to compensate a consumer in case he/she undergoes an injury or a loss due to defective goods or poor services.”“We already have received 306 consumer complaints under the amended Act. Nearly 100 more are before the additional consumer court, which handles matters arising from rural Pune,” he said. Insurance and banking sector matters account for almost 50% of cases under the amended Act, he said. Of late, matters relating to e-commerce services are also coming, he added. Comparatively, realty matters have gone down for varied reasons, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dist-needs-one-more-bench-with-rising-consumer-cases/articleshow/81518628.cms||Vishwas Kothari

---||Coimbatore||Train hits, seriously injures tusker on Tamil Nadu-Kerala border||COIMBATORE: A tusker suffered severe injuries after it was hit by a speeding train in Madukkarai forest range of the Coimbatore forest division in the early hours of Monday. Around 1.20am on Monday, forest department officials received information that a wild elephant was hit by a speeding train at least 300m away from the reserve forest at Navakkarai Pirivu in Cholakkarai beat of the Madukkarai forest range. A team of frontline staff from the forest department were already trying to chase away five elephants from the track at Pudhupathi when they received the information about a speeding Thiruvananthapuram–Chennai express had hit an elephant on the B line of the track. The team rushed to the spot where they found the male elephant lying at least 5-10metre away from the railway track. The elephant had suffered severe injuries on its hip and was not able to move his hind legs. The left tusk of the elephant was also broken in the accident. Forest veterinarians reached the spot and administered medicines and food to the injured elephant. “A team of doctors will examine the elephant for further treatment,” district forest officer of Coimbatore forest division D Venkatesh said. The elephant is still being treated by the forest veterinarians. Preliminary inquiries revealed that the loco pilot of the Thiruvananthapuram- Chennai express train noticed the elephant at least 50m away on the truck and applied brakes. However, the train hit the elephant and dragged it along the tracks for at least 100m before throwing it off the track. The loco pilot then informed the forest department about the incident. A senior railway official said that a series of steps have been put in place after elephant crossing locations were identified. “Signage to warn loco pilots, speed restrictions of 65kmph in the day and 45kmph at night, widening of railway cuttings and embankment for elephants to move away from tracks, solar lights to stop the elephants from crossing, underpass and overpass have been provided to allow elephants to move, audio alarms sounding like bees, and a few other measures have been done.” The forest department has also installed solar fencing with low voltage electricity. The coordination between the railway loco pilots, station masters and forest trackers have helped save many elephants by stopping them from crossing before trains passed, he added. The injured elephant was shifted to Chadivayal elephant camp for further treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/efforts-on-to-save-tusker-hit-by-train/articleshow/81520106.cms||---

Since the charges against him were proved, disciplinary authority had imposed a punishment of reduction of pay.When the petitioner filed an appeal, the appellate authority had enhanced the punishment to dismissal from service. Aggrieved by the same, the petitioner had filed a review and the reviewing authority had modified it as compulsory retirement.The petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench in 2014, challenging these orders and the court had set aside the punishment orders and directed to reinstate the same. Challenging the order of the single judge, the state government had preferred the present appeal.A division bench of justices M M Sundresh and S Ananthi observed that Article 14 of the Constitution would certainly come into play when similarly placed people involved in similar charges are imposed with lesser punishment.The judges said that the special government pleader submitted that he was also not able to get instructions as to why lesser punishment was imposed against the similarly placed erring officials and dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-upholds-order-to-reinstate-policeman/articleshow/81520130.cms||---

While the number of incidents came down steeply last year amid Covid-19 lockdown, the city has witnessed a spike in January and February, this year.In 2020, 83 break-in incidents were reported, while nearly 30 have been reported in the first two months of this year. Of them, 17 took place in January alone.A police officer from the crime unit of the city police said that most incidents involved looting of cash, except for a few where valuables were also looted. The official said that around jewellery weighing 55 sovereigns and cash Rs 5.8 lakh were looted from a house in Pykara in February, gold jewellery weighing 19 sovereigns from a house in Koodalpudur police limits, 23 sovereigns in Sellur limits and 58 sovereigns in SS Colony limits were looted in January. He assured that the crimes will come down soon once a few cases are detected and those involved were caught.A higher police officer said that preventive measures are being taken to bring down the crime rate. Additional officials have been roped into the crime team and the teams have been given targets to crack the cases. Police patrolling has also been increased with more number of bike patrolling in place.“We have cracked a few cases and are working on the other cases. Recently, we nabbed three notorious criminals. One major burglar has been identified, but he is yet to be picked up. Teams are working on it,” he said.He added that people also should cooperate with city police by installing CCTV cameras covering houses, apartments and streets. With summer around the corner, there is another challenge for the city police as people sleeping inside their houses, leave the doors open. Open houses will lure thieves. Police sources said that Tallakulam range is witnessing less number of crimes after a new station was carved out in Thirupalai. Now police forces can concentrate better in their respective limits in the range||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-witnesses-spike-in-burglary-incidents/articleshow/81520140.cms||V Devanathan

Authorities said initially swab samples of one teacher turned positive and the rest of the confirmed cases were among contacts tested for the virus. A higher-class student and an employee, who cooks midday meals for students, were the other two who tested positive. “We have started the exercise of contact tracing 400 students, 50 staffers and their families,” district education officer (DEO) Mancherial, S Venkateshwarlu said. As news of one teacher testing positive spread early on Monday, the number of students attending school came down. “Altogether 55 contacts of the first teacher were tested on Monday and 14 were found to be positive. Tomorrow, we will test other students and their family members as well. Also, the school will be sanitised,” said Dr M Neeraja, district medical and health officer (DMHO), Mancherial, said. All the 14 are currently stable and are in home quarantine, the DMHO said. Reacting to the news, Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, national secretary, Indian Medical Association, said the virus was spreading in schools basically due to cramping more children in less-ventilated rooms and not maintaining distance. “With so many holidays, it’s difficult to ensure that children don’t talk or discuss things with each other. Since most schools are run from houses, they can as well do online classes as a preventive measure,” he said. Alarmed at the incident and another three positive cases reported from a school in Secunderabad, experts have sounded an alert for schools to take adequate precautions. “Since more Covid-19 cases are being reported in Telangana and in neighbouring states, there needs to be alertness, especially in schools. The schools present in Covid hotspots need to take extra precautions such as physical distancing, masks and limited students in a class,” said Prof Subodh Kandamuthan, director, Centre for Healthcare Management, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI). “Awareness among students and a community approach is required to tide over the crisis,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/12-teachers-among-14-test-ve-in-mancherial-govt-school/articleshow/81521210.cms||---

---||Delhi||Taps run dry in parts of east Delhi for fourth day||NEW DELHI: Despite being provided assurance by Delhi Jal Board (DJB) on Sunday, parts of Mayur Vihar, Pandav Nagar and other tail-end colonies in east Delhi failed to receive water supply on Monday morning. DJB officials said that water supply had been restored in 90% of the areas in the morning, but as areas like Mayur Vihar were at the tail end of the distribution system, it would take time for water to reach them. Many residents took to social media to express outrage over supply being disrupted for the fourth consecutive day. However, the water utility assured that most of the remaining colonies would start getting supply in the next round. Prince Kumar from Shakurpur B-Block said, “Water supply is still not available in my area for the past 72 hours. We don’t have a drop of water to complete our basic routine.” A few areas that received water reported low pressure and short duration of supply. SK Ranjan from Mayur Vihar Phase-I said supply had not been restored till the evening. “DJB should disseminate information seriously. Water supply resumed in Pocket 1 of Mayur Vihar-I in the evening for barely 10 minutes and the pressure was very low. We have been buying water for Rs 50 for a 20-litre jar,” he added. Rahul Meena from J-Block in Laxmi Nagar said it was four days since the area residents had received water. “Can somebody take ownership and let me know when supply will be restored?” he asked. Many other residents who finally received supply expressed happiness. On Sunday, DJB had stated that the work of interconnection and repair of the main pipeline had been completed by 4pm and water supply would be restored by the evening. “The supply will be normalised in the evening in areas where water is received by direct tapping. The areas that receive water via underground reservoirs will receive supply by Sunday morning as the UGRs first need to be levelled with water from the Bhagirathi treatment plant,” the water utility had stated following an extended disruption period that was initially expected to last only 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/taps-run-dry-in-parts-of-e-delhi-for-fourth-day/articleshow/81520188.cms||---

On behalf of the bank employees, I would request the district administration to also allow our family members to get vaccinated along with us.” According to Vijay Singla, a private bank employee, “We are thankful to the district administration for allowing us to get shots of vaccine for coronavirus. From past few days the cases of coronavirus are on the rise and situation in the city is getting from bad to worse and vaccination is the only alternative which can help in plugging this pandemic. Considering the job hazards which we face, vaccination for bank employees was need of the hour.” Notably, on Monday DC Sharma passed orders for allowing vaccination for journalists, employees of all government and private banks, government and private schools, staff of food grain agencies, judicial officers, court staff, advocates, members of the non-government organisations who have worked to check the spread of Covid-19 pandemic by registering them as frontline workers.

The court also observed that the manner in which records were created to show that the woman died during transit to the government Rajaji hospital (GRH), needs to be inquired.Sakthikali was admitted at the K Pudur urban primary health centre (UPHC) on September 14, 2019 for delivery. When she went into labour, the duty doctor was not in the hospital. Later, her husband Manimuthu who noticed his wife lying in a pool of blood rushed her to the GRH, however, she was declared brought dead. Based on his complaint, the K Pudur police had registered a case under section 174 CrPC.Manimuthu moved the HC Madurai bench seeking compensation of Rs 10 lakh for medical negligence. The single judge found prima facie material that the inspector Muthukumar attempted to protect the doctor, who was working in the UPHC and has created records as if the woman died during transit. Hence, the judge had directed the Madurai city commissioner of police to initiate appropriate departmental action against the inspector.Challenging the order, Muthukumar filed an appeal.

Varicose veins is a condition when the blood vessels taking impure blood from the leg to the heart get enlarged and leads to change in colour of foot. Earlier the only treatment available was a surgery to remove the impure vessels. Vena seal involved inserting a fine tube through a small needle puncture at the knee joint, with ultrasound guidance. The tube is then navigated across the length of the vein and then a medical grade glue is injected along the entire length of the vessel. This glue obliterates the vein permanently, which in turn removes the symptoms caused by varicose veins. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-hospital-introduces-treatment-for-varicose-veins/articleshow/81520160.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Cong, BJP face off for first time in Ooty constituency||Udhagamandalam: While all political parties have announced candidates for the three assembly constituencies in the Nilgiris, BJP is yet to announce its candidate for the Ooty constituency.This is the first time Congress is fighting BJP directly in the constituency. The other two constituencies, Coonoor and Gudalur (reserved), will see a direct fight between DMK and AIADMK as in the last election. BJP had contested in the 2011 and 2016 elections without any alliance.Ooty constituency, which is in existence since the 1957 election, has been a Congress bastion. The party had won nine assembly elections in the constituency out of 14 polls mostly either in the front led by one of the two major Dravidian parties, except in 1977. It contested alone in 1989 and won the seat. Since then, AIADMK and DMK, in whichever poll they allied with Congress, allotted the Ooty constituency to the party.However, in 2011 election, Congress candidate R Ganesh (DMK alliance) lost to his rival AIADMK candidate Buddhi Chandran, a former minister. Ganesh reclaimed the seat in 2016, defeating AIADMK’s Kappachi D Vinoth. Incumbent Congress MLA Ganesh has been named for the third time as the Congress candidate by the DMK front. BJP, which has been allotted the constituency by the AIADMK front, is yet to name its candidate, even as there is only two weeks left for the election. According to sources, BJP lacks a strong candidate to fight the popular Congress MLA.AMMK has fielded Denadu T Lakshmanan , an ex-AIADMK cadre, as its candidate, while MNM has chosen Suresh Kumar.All MLAs who had won from the Ooty constituency right from 1957 polls were from the Badaga community, a major indigenous community in the Nilgiris.With 2,05,138 voters, including 1,06,775 women, Ooty constituency has 308 polling stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cong-bjp-face-off-for-first-time-in-ooty-constituency/articleshow/81520132.cms||---
---||Chennai||‘I no longer put undue pressure on myself’||The first Indian fencer to qualify for the Olympics, Bhavani Devi has come a long way from being the girl who chose fencing in school to keep herself occupied. Coming from a modest financial background, the path to glory has been tough and challenging, but the 27-year-old has taken the obstacles in her stride. In an interview with Prasad Ramasubramanian, the Chennai athlete looks back on the sacrifices her parents made to fuel her ambition and talks about preparations for the world’s biggest stage. Excerpts:Q: What was your first reaction when it was confirmed that you qualified for the Tokyo Olympics?There was a sense of relief. It took me some time to realise that I have finally made the cut. This is reward for the hard yards I have put in, the effort that my coaches and support staff have put in, and for my mother who has been a pillar of support. Having said that, qualifying for the Olympics is just the first step as the real test will start now. Q: Did you take some time to rewind your journey?Yes, I did. From the time I picked up fencing over a decade-and-a-half ago in school to now — all these years flashed past. I remembered the tough moments, the sacrifices of my parents, preparations for this day for the past few years.Q: What was the role your parents played in your fencing sojourn?I am here because of my family. There are no two ways about it. Despite hailing from a middle-class background (father C Sundararamana was a priest and mother Ramani a housewife), my parents stood by me through thick and thin. My mother pawned her jewellery to fuel my ambition. They would borrow money to help me participate in competitions. I have missed competitions when we failed to arrange for the money. I lost my father two years ago and I am missing him the most at this point of time.Over the years, my support system has included the GoSports Foundation who back me through the Rahul Dravid Athlete Mentorship Programme, the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu, Sports Authority of India and Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. There are so many people whom I want to thank at this time without whom this journey wouldn’t have been possible. Q: You missed the 2016 Rio Games but made the grade this time. What have been the changes you brought to your game in the last few years?The first change I made was to my mental make-up. Earlier, I would put undue pressure on myself, but not anymore. Today, I carry what I call ‘good stress’ ahead of any event or training. It includes staying in the moment, giving my best shot and not have any regrets if the result doesn’t go in my favour. It’s easier said than done but I have got into that mode now. I had prepared for a year or so to qualify for the Rio Games and missing the bus hurt me. It taught me the importance of preparation and putting in place strong processes so that the results will follow.Q: You have been working with Italian coach Nicola Zanotti for the past four-and-a-half years. How has he shaped your game?Having worked with him for so long, we understand each other well. He made me realise my potential, the areas I could work and got the best out of me. He has changed my approach towards the sport and I am a more confident fencer now. Apart from Nicola, my base in the sport was set by other prominent coaches Vishwanathan in Chennai and Sagar Lagu from Sports Authority of India in Thalaserry. Q: Will there be changes in the way you train ahead of the Games?Not at all. In fact, we will continue to train the way we have all these years. We have always looked for continuity in our training sessions and that will not change because I have qualified for the Olympics.Q: How have you seen the profile of fencing as a sport change?The sport is becoming popular with more and more fencers taking to it. For many years now, I have been the lone Indian representation in international fencing meets. I hope that scenario changes in the coming years. With more performances by athletes on the international circuit, the profile of fencing will surely go up in future.Q: Do you reckon that fencing will be followed more in India now that we have a fencer who will feature at the Olympics?I would hope so. The more people support fencing, the better it is for the sport. I will be the happiest if I am able to motivate youngsters to take up fencing. It is a fantastic sport that teaches you sharpness, agility and is extremely competitive. Q: It’s been a long journey for you. How do you plan to celebrate this important moment in your life?I don’t have anything planned. Since I haven’t slept much in the past few days, the aim will be to get some good sleep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/i-no-longer-put-undue-pressure-on-myself/articleshow/81518634.cms||---

---||Pune||DGDE directs cantonments to finalise nominated members before Mar 19||Pune: The Directorate General of Defence Estates has directed all 56 cantonments, including Pune, Khadki and Dehu Road, to send names of nominated members before March 19.The elected bodies of the cantonment boards stand dissolved since February 10 following the lapse of their terms.Now, the cantonment boards are due for elections and the exercise for electoral roll revision is on. The same is expected to take five to six months to complete. Till then, a three-member panel consisting of cantonment board president, CEO and a nominated member will work as an ad hoc body.The nominated member will provide feedback and suggestions on behalf of cantonment residents regarding their problems and needs.“All three cantonments in Pune have received applications from aspiring candidates. They applicants have submitted their profiles and the work they have done in the cantonment areas over the years. Their names would be first shortlisted by the president of the cantonment board. These names would be forwarded to General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Southern Command for approval. Only those names recommended by the army commander, as per the procedure, will be sent to the Ministry of Defence for final approval,” said a senior official from the DGDE.Maximum of these applicants are either former board members or vice-presidents. Six from Pune, seven from Khadki and five from Dehu Road cantonment boards have submitted their applications with the respective president’s office.“As per the procedure, the president has discretionary powers to shortlist the names. Sometimes, he can send all the names, if he finds potential in all applicants. However, usually the final name is selected by the ministry politically,” added the official.This process is crucial for cantonments as the ministry would need at least a few months to declare the elections plans for these cantonments, said the sources.“Without the body, no cantonment board could function smoothly. The ministry has issued directive in this regard as it wants to complete the process at the earliest,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dgde-directs-cantonments-to-finalise-nominated-members-before-mar-19/articleshow/81519323.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Ahmedabad||HC notice to husband for failing to file divorce plea||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has issued notice to a man and sought explanation as to why he did not file the divorce petition that he had promised the court and his wife that he would. The HC has asked for explanation after the wife filed a petition seeking direction to her husband to file the petition in the family court and demanding action against him for committing contempt of court. This was because he was dragging his feet from fulfilling his own promise and for not abiding by the court’s instructions issued three months ago. This litigation began after the couple fell apart within three years of getting married in February 2018. The woman, who is pursuing her CA, returned to her maternal family and filed a complaint at Bapunagar police station against her husband levelling various accusations including abduction. The husband approached HC in November 2020 and claimed that his wife’s parents had forcibly detained her and forced her to file the false complaint. The court heard the woman and noticed that the relationship was irretrievably broken and had no future. The court persuaded her not to indulge in accusations and advised the couple to apply for divorce with mutual consent. The husband also promised the court that he would file a divorce plea under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act for separation with mutual consent. The HC instructed the family court to take decision on their divorce petition at the earliest. It even permitted the family court to waive off six-month cooling period and not to insist on the aspect of reunion. However, as the husband retracted, the woman sought court’s direction for her husband to file for divorce. Her advocate Meet Shah urged before the court that the husband was not willing to fulfil his promise and demanded, “It is a matter of contempt. Therefore, the court may accordingly issue the notice”. After the court issued notice to the husband, the lawyer, appointed by court to provide legal aid in separation, approached the court with a complaint that the man had misbehaved with his assistant. The HC has asked the lawyer to file a report in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-to-husband-for-failing-to-file-divorce-plea/articleshow/81518656.cms||---
---||Madurai||Social activist file nomination against liquour sale, vote for cash||Madurai: A social activist from Sellur filed his nomination to contest from the Madurai North constituency in order to create sensitisation against the government selling liqour and cash distribution to voters by political parties.M P Sankarapandi, 35 created a buzz at the Madurai Corporation Zone Two office on Monday where he came to file the nomination wearing a garland made of empty liquor bottles. On one hand, he held a plate with Re1 notes. He collected the bottles from Sellur tank, where the bottles were dumped by tipplers, he said.Sankarapandi is an activist working for the conservation of Sellur tank and preservation of underground water for the past five years. He is a school dropout and is a flooring tiles contractor by profession. “I always wanted to do something for the people. I joined politics to serve people. I was an area secretary of DMDK party. But soon I realized that I cannot do any good for people in politics, hence I came out of it. Since then, I have been working at the grassroots level,” he said.He organized people at Sellur and staged protests against establishing a Tasmac shop at Poonthottam and moved the high court. While he was the president of the Sellur Tank Kudimaramathu Kuzhu, he flagged issues in de-silting works, following which he was relieved from it. He has also been creating awareness against distribution of cash for votes by reaching out to the people.“People should not sell their votes for a few thousand rupees. Their vote is valuable. Electing a right person will bring about the changes they want to see in their constituency. Hence, I showcased Re1 notes on a place,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/social-activist-file-nomination-against-liquour-sale-vote-for-cash/articleshow/81520171.cms||V Devanathan

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Konda Vishweshwar Reddy takes break from Congress, keeps other parties guessing||HYDERABAD: Former Chevella MP Konda Vishweshwar Reddy, scion of a well-known political family and son-in-law of Apollo Group of Hospitals chairman C Pratap Reddy, is on a three-month sabbatical from Congress. Though the political grapevine is he is jumping on to the BJP bandwagon, sources close to Vishweshwar Reddy said he has discussed with his close associates in the Chevella parliamentary constituency about the possibility of launching a new party. However, before taking any decision on his future course of action, he wants to wait and watch for the result of the Nagarjunasagar assembly by-poll. He informed Telangana Congress president N Uttam Kumar Reddy about his decision to take a break. Though his political baptism happened in TRS, the engineer-turned-politician had quit the ruling party and joined Congress just before the December 2018 assembly elections. Vishweshwar Reddy told TOI he has not decided to join any party. Also, he has not resigned from the Congress. “I will be away from Congress, but will be active in politics. I am keeping all my options open. I may float a new party to fight against the present dispensation in Telangana or wait to see if Congress can stand firmly against this government. I have personal reasons too to take a break,” he added. He expressed unhappiness over the way things were moving in Congress at the national level. “But it is important that once you are in a party, it is difficult to think objectively, act independently. So that’s why I have decided to keep distance, explore options on how to take on this TRS government,” he said. He might also return to TRS fold if things change for the better. But he laughed at his statement indicating it was not a serious comment. However, he made it clear he has not made a commitment to any political party to join it. The talk in political circles that he might join BJP has been there for two to three years now, he said. Reason for his decision now? Vishweshwar Reddy said he did not want the poll prospects of Congress MLC candidate G Chinna Reddy to suffer due to his decision. “I campaigned for Chinna Reddy from Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahabubnagar graduate MLC constituency. I hope he wins,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/konda-takes-break-from-congress-keeps-other-parties-guessing/articleshow/81521262.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Goa||Mumbai City turn focus to developing players||Panaji: Long before the influential City Football Group (CFG) decided to pick up 65 per cent stakes in Mumbai City FC, they spent considerable time here, understanding the football ecosystem. CFG surveyed the landscape and held meetings with important stakeholders. By the time they made up their mind, the group with considerable expertise managing clubs across the world – at last count there were ten -- knew exactly what to do. Sergio Lobera, who had made a name for himself at FC Goa with a brand of football that captivated everyone, was the first target. Then the players followed him, and the rest as they say is history. “The starting point and foundation of the success we have had together is the alignment between Sergio’s vision of how the game should be played and CFG and its beautiful football ethos,” CFG India CEO Damian Willoughby told reporters on a conference call early this week. “Through the marriage of Sergio and CFG, we were able to construct a squad that was capable of competing at the top end of ISL. All credit to Sergio, he did a phenomenal job.” Mumbai won the League Winners Shield and the Indian Super League (ISL) trophy in its first season. So, what next for a group that won everything on debut? AFC Champions League would seem like the most natural answer, but there is more to Mumbai than just winning trophies. “The challenge for us is to put into place a robust football organisation and a football pyramid that enables the club to identify, nurture and develop talented young players. “If we are able to do that successfully, we’ll be able to have a healthy and sustainable football club with great players who play wonderful football and go on to represent the national team,” said Willoughby. The most successful clubs across the world, Willoughby pointed out, are those that have a track record of developing young players. That’s what Mumbai are now aiming for, and if they can manage to do that, it will be a “much more efficient and economical way to build a club.” “We are excited to deploy these plans,” said the CEO. “We want to build a much more robust system that has players playing more frequently, more games, more diverse exposure, and implementing the City Football Group way. Using our knowledge, we also want to develop coaches that can deliver that style to young players on a consistent basis.” Winning the ISL League Winner’s Shield means Mumbai now have a place in next year’s AFC Champions League. CFG knows all about Asian football’s top-tier club competition with Melbourne City FC (Australia) and Yokohama F Marinos (Japan) – from their bouquet -- regularly competing for honours. It is this experience that can give Mumbai an edge. “The challenges of AFC Champions League will be different to the ISL, given the level of teams representing various Asian nations. We are excited by the opportunity of representing India and pitting our wits against the best teams in the continent,” said Willoughby. Lobera gave FC Goa the league title last season – even if he wasn’t there to savour it – and has now done even better with a double. Having stepped out of the bio-secure bubble after taxing five months, the Spanish coach understandably wanted to enjoy the moment but was left in no doubt that there is plenty more to come. “I have achieved a lot of things during the last four years in India,” said Lobera. “This season was important for me, not just winning the trophy but enjoying the journey and working with people with a big knowledge about football. In this group you can grow a lot as a coach.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mumbai-city-turn-focus-to-developing-players/articleshow/81537796.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Most ATMs also remained shut with the security personnel not working during the strike. From businessmen to professors to homemakers, many had to return empty-handed when they visited ATMs to withdraw money for emergency purposes. The strike is likely to continue to Tuesday, but customers can use net banking, mobile banking and digital wallets for transactions. Sanjoy Bose, a businessman from Kankurgachi, pointed out he could withdraw cash from an ATM on Sunday, but ran out of luck on Monday. “I have my own business and need cash all the time. I had withdrawn money on Sunday but when I needed more cash on Monday, I went looking for ATMs, but found them shut. What makes it worse is that we won’t be able to use the facilities even on Tuesday,” he added. Anandam Banerjee from Hazra, who works in an MNC, was unaware of the strike. “I could not get cash from any ATM in spite of driving around for over 7-8km. I had to borrow some cash from one of my friends,” he added. The two-day strike was called by United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU). Rajen Nagar, general secretary of BPBEA and president of AIBEA, two major constituents of UFBU, said the strike, which was called against the privatization of PSU banks and insurance companies, would continue till March 16, according to the original plan. “More than 90% of the 12,000-odd ATMs and 8,214 bank branches in the state were closed on Monday. A lot of new private sector banks also participated in the strike,” he said, adding UFBU kept ATMs at or near hospitals out of the ambit of the strike, considering it might inconvenience patients’ families, who might be in emergency need of money. Nagar claimed that in the past eight years, total write-off by 12 banks was Rs 6.3 lakh crore. Nagar added that UFBU would meet after the strike to decide on the future course of action, including further strike if government did not reconsider its decision to privatize public sector banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/customers-desperate-for-cash-as-banks-go-on-strike/articleshow/81518695.cms||Zeeshan Javed

CM Rawat stressed that there should be no compromise with the quality of work and that he would conduct physical verification of projects himself. For timely completion of projects, he directed the authorities to hold frequent meetings and also inspect the site. The CM said that Char Dham shrines are the major centres of faith across the globe while adding that there would be a sharp increase in the devotee turnout this year.

CM Rawat also directed for the closure of Tota Ghati road, which is a part of the Char Dham all-weather road, due to the ongoing works. Notably, the broadening of the road on the National Highway-59 route which connects Rishikesh with Badrinath and Kedarnath is underway and as a precautionary measure, it has been directed to let vehicles pass through other routes. Due to road cutting and broadening work at Tota Ghati, long traffic jams are being witnessed on both sides of the route. CM Rawat told the authorities to complete the work at Tota Ghati by March 31. The chief minister further said that adequate arrangements of drinking water, sanitation, signage and other basic facilities should be made for the pilgrims on the travel routes. He directed the officials to expedite road-related works at Joshimath, Gaurikund-Sonprayag and other areas. “During the Char Dham Yatra, pilgrims should get smooth helicopter service. Special care should be taken for transparency in ticket distribution. Proper arrangements for air ambulance and 108 ambulance services should be made,” he added.

---||India||Arrest illegal, made scapegoat: Sachin Waze files habeas corpus plea in HC||MUMBAI: Suspended police officer Sachin Waze, through his brother Sudhram, on Monday filed a habeas corpus petition in the Bombay high court alleging that his arrest is illegal and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) intends to “target someone else”. The habeas corpus (produce the body) is a plea to direct the NIA to produce Waze before the HC and set him free. The petition claimed that Waze was “made a scapegoat by certain political powers” by using Vimla Hiren, the widow of Mansukh Hiren whose body was found in Kalwa creek days after his Scorpio was found parked suspiciously outside businessman Mukesh Ambani’s residence in south Mumbai last month. NIA’s action “makes it evident that they are acting with malafide intentions and ulterior motives ... to tarnish the name, image and reputation of the petitioner’s brother for reasons best known to them,” stated the plea submitted by advocate Sunny Punamiya. Waze’s fundamental rights have been violated and his life may be at risk, the petition claimed, as the officers “can go to any extent to extract an illegal and false confession”. It added that “right before his arrest, Waze had sent a WhatsApp message to his near and dear ones that he may be trapped by his fellow officers and this time he may not survive this ordeal.” Read AlsoAmbani security scare: Maharashtra suspends police officer Sachin Waze; NIA says SUV not stolen, was at his homeAs the Maharashtra government on Monday suspended arrested police officer Sachin Waze, sources told TOI the NIA has found that the explosives-laden Scorpio found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25 was not stolen, as alleged by Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, but was“Waze has been wrongfully arrested in violation of the provisions laid down in the Criminal Procedure Code Section and innumerable Supreme Court judgments,” the plea said, adding: “The haste with which he was arrested clearly shows some ulterior motives and huge political influence and interference with the sole intent to use him as a scapegoat to further certain political agendas of some big interested parties.” The petition further claimed that the case filed by Vimla with the anti-terrorism squad on March 7 against unknown persons made “false, frivolous and concocted allegations” against Waze, blaming him for her husband’s death. It added that “surprisingly, the very next day, an FIR was registered by the NIA against unknown persons”. The petition said that Waze has no intention of absconding; in fact, he had cooperated with the NIA who interrogated him for 10 hours before arresting him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/arrest-illegal-made-scapegoat-sachin-waze-files-habeas-corpus-plea-in-hc/articleshow/81521944.cms||Swati Deshpande

In his FIR with Ellisbridge police, SVP resident medical officer (RMO) Dr Kuldeep Joshi, 47, stated that a patient named Ushadevi Vyas, a resident of Pali in Rajasthan, had come to the hospital on March 12 midnight. During treatment, a doctor in the emergency ward, Dharmik Mankodia, told her relatives that the patient could die if she was not put on ventilator immediately. At the time, Ushadevi’s relative Lalit Vyas allegedly misinterpreted Mankodia’s statement and began fighting with him, asking how he, despite being a doctor, could say that the patient would die. Mankodia called his superior Dr Bhavesh Jarwani, a professor, to the emergency ward to tackle the situation. But Lalit continued to pressure Mankodia and Jarwani to tender an apology and did not allow them to shift the patient to a ventilator, alleged Joshi in the FIR. Meanwhile, Lalit called another relative, Dineshchandra Dave, and continued fighting with the doctors on duty, Joshi alleged, adding, “As Ushadevi’s relative did not allow the doctors to keep her on ventilators, she died at around 11 am on Sunday. After this, Lalit and Dave began fighting with the doctors, blaming them for their patient’s death. They did not allow for the body to be sent for post-mortem examination. They also took away medicines worth Rs 5,000 from the hospital.” He later filed a complaint of obstruction in duty with Ellisbridge police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/patient-dies-kin-booked-for-fight-with-svp-docs/articleshow/81518703.cms||---

During the day, Trivendra Rawat met Avdheshanand Giri, Acharya Mahamandaleshwar of the Juna Akhada, at his ashram in Kankhal where the former CM also interacted with mediapersons. He said that taking a risk during the pandemic is not right as the number of Covid cases is increasing across the country which is a matter of concern. “Earlier, only three states were affected in the second wave, but now, it has affected seven states. It is our responsibility to stop the pandemic. The vaccination drive is going on but there are limited doses. Many are not even serious about vaccination and are not coming forward to get it. Kumbh is an international event and we should not take any chance with the pandemic,” he added. Around 32 lakh pilgrims reached Haridwar for the first royal bath on March 11, out of which only 40,000 pilgrims were tested by the health department, and 10 tested positive for Covid-19. However, as per the high court direction, RT-PCR negative report along with registration was mandatory for the first bathing festival to come to Haridwar. Notably, neither the police nor mela administration has data on how many pilgrims came with proper registration along with the test reports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-still-a-big-threat-cases-rising-in-several-states-says-trivendra/articleshow/81517556.cms||MS Nawaz

The funds will be spent on developing the forest and to increase its green cover. “The recently held budget session of the state assembly approved the funds,” BJP MLA Madhauri Misal who represents Parvati constituency said at a press conference on Monday.The work comes under the umbrella project being implemented on 810 acres by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and by the forest department on 980 acres across the city. Bamboo plantation, an open air amphitheatre, construction of an entrance gate, water management, a yoga centre and a playground for children are on the anvil. Misal said the state government had also assured of financial help for the Ambil Odha development project but no funds have been allocated as yet. The project was planned after the massive flood in September 2019 that caused extensive damage to properties, roads and also loss of lives along the stream. “The natural calamity caused financial losses to the locals. They were expected to get help but no budgetary allocation has been made,” she said. Funds have not been given to other big projects in the city like the high capacity mass transit route and Swargate to Katraj metro rail, nor was any allocation made for the 23 merged villages which will hamper their development projects, Misal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-grants-rs-13-crore-to-conserve-taljai-hill/articleshow/81519169.cms||---

Seeking their further remand, the state prosecution told the special court that one of the arrested suspects in the case had promised Tangvelu Rs25 lakh if the question paper of the common entrance exam was leaked.Additional public prosecutor Prem Agarwal submitted that Tangvelu from Tamil Nadu, arrested on March 7, had promised to give a part of the money to Kilari from New Delhi, arrested on March 9. He said Kilari, in turn, had assured to share some money with one of the suspects on the run.Agarwal argued that experts from the forensic science laboratory, Mumbai, had retrieved the deleted cellphone communications/data exchanged in Tamil between the two arrested army officers. He sought time to seek help of interpreters for translating them in local language and confront the officers if any new information related to question paper leak was revealed.He sought sufficient time for police to probe the financial transactions of the suspects, identify the people who received the question paper, trace the source from where the paper was leaked and arrest a suspect on the run.Defence lawyers Rahul Deshmukh and Rahul Lonandakar pleaded to send Tangvelu and Kilari in judicial custody, claiming that their detention in police custody was not essential because the court had given enough time to the investigation officer to question them.The lawyers submitted that their clients could be questioned even in judicial custody after the interpreters translated the seized communication/data retrieved from their cellphones.After hearing both the sides, the court upheld the prosecution’s plea and extended the police custody remand of the arrested army officers till March 20. Lawyer Jyoti Pawar appeared for Akadmol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/court-extends-police-custody-remand-of-two-army-majors/articleshow/81519190.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||---||AIADMK U-turn on CAA leaves BJP embarrassed||The AIADMK’s U-turn on CAA has upset ally BJP. After voting for the law in Parliament, the AIADMK manifesto released on Sunday says the party will press the Centre to scrap it. Both AIADMK and BJP leaders admitted that reigniting the CAA debate was a bid to woo the minorities ahead of the election. "Knowing the Centre’s stand, the AIADMK leadership should not make this (CAA) issue alive again. It is an embarrassment for us," state IT wing president of BJP C T R Nirmal Kumar said and recalled chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami’s speech in support of the CAA in the state assembly. EPS, however, after filing his nomination papers on Monday, said, "We have clarified that our government will press the Centre (to scrap the Act). Amma’s government will always protect the rights and welfare of minorities." Political critic Kolahala Srenivaas said ever since it tied up with the BJP, the AIADMK has been in a dilemma over taking a stand on issues related to the minorities. He recalled party MP Anwhar Raajhaa vehement opposition to the Triple Talaq Bill in the upper house, while the AIADMK voted in support of it. BJP spokesperson Narayanan Thirupathy said the AIADMK had "yielded to the pressure" from opposition parties. AIADMK leaders should stick to their stand and try to convince people who didn’t understand CAA. But a former AIADMK district secretary in Vellore called the party’s decision to urge the Modi government to scrap CAA a "course correction", but said it was "too late". "We lost the minorities’ confidence in us. Amma would have been the first to oppose such an act," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-u-turn-on-caa-leaves-bjp-embarrassed/articleshow/81520241.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune hospitals to get vaccine doses for only 10 sessions at a time||PUNE: Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao on Monday told TOI that hospitals would now be allotted doses for 10 days (or sessions) at a time. This comes after some senior health department officials brought to Rao’s notice the issue of “over-stocking” of Covishield doses by some major health hubs, bought by them as per their financial capability. “According to reports from the health department, there have been instances of some major hospitals, which can afford to pay for larger quantities, over-stocking the vaccine doses. We will ensure that hospitals, even if they are ready to pay, will not get doses for more than 10 days (or sessions) at a time,” Rao said. Rao said this will ensure equitable distribution of vaccine doses. “The authorities will have the liberty of equally distributing the vaccine from the available doses and send it where required. For instance, some doses can be picked from the city and sent to rural areas, if the latter have a requirement,” he said. Citing an instance of “over-stocking” in Velhe, a district health department official told TOI, “Instances of over-stocking was noticed in Velhe, but such cases cannot cause a shortage of vaccine in the entire district. Wherever such instances have been found, new vaccine batches are not being supplied.” Rao stressed that almost all hospitals in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits had Covishield stocks even now and there were no instances of second dose beneficiaries being turned away because of non-availability of the vaccine. He said there was no need to panic over vaccine availability in Pune and the situation was under control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hospitals-to-get-vaccine-doses-for-only-10-sessions-at-a-time/articleshow/81518700.cms||Neha Madaan

A closer look at police data show that 94% of them belong to private persons. District-wise data on gun licences reveal that most guns are owned in the Rayalaseema region like Kadapa, Chittoor, Kurnool and Anantapur respectively. While the urban commissionerate limits like Vijayawada and Vizag have less, barely around 600. In Vijayawada, there are 378 licensed guns and the rest of the Krishna district police unit has 336 of them. With majority of the polls remaining unanimous in the Rayalaseema and other regions, cops point out that there wasn’t any sort of gun violence being reported anywhere in the state. Official data show that 30 guns were impounded ahead of the gram panchayat elections. Apart from that, officials also seized 17 country made weapons, 1,058 gelatin sticks, electric wires air pistols that were illegally possessed. Not surprisingly, the least number of gun licencees are present in Prakasam, Nellore, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts. Police sources in the city point out that the majority of licensed guns possessed in the state are regular renewals from local individuals and that there are bare minimum when it comes to new licences being issued every year. It is pertinent to note that these 9,942 licences are only valid within the state jurisdiction and cops point out that there are some with all-India permits that are issued by the Union home ministry. Cancellation of gun licences too has been minimal to around two per cent in state. Compared to the overall gun licenses in the country, AP accounts for only 0.2% which is among five lowest of all states and Union territories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/andhra-has-9942-gun-licences-rseema-home-to-most-holders/articleshow/81517439.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Following complaints from environmental activists, the NGT had imposed a penalty of Rs 100 crore on the state government. The state government issued the orders on Monday giving clearance to the water resources department to start desilting work. The government also authorised the superintending engineer of Vijayawada to take further action. As per the new orders, desilting operations will start half-a-kilometre away from Praksam Barrage in the upstream.

There was no possibility to do heliborne exploration because of the hills. But we walked all the way up the hills to begin the exploration,” D K Sinha, director, Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD) said in Hyderabad on Monday. Speaking on the sidelines of a one-day seminar on ‘radiation and environment’ organised by the Indian Nuclear Society, Sinha said he went to the farthest village in the Indian side of the border, Mechuka valley. The top scientist said the exploration for uranium had yielded positive results and further activity would continue, which would also result in mining. The exploration was taken up in Aalo of West Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh, about 619 meters from ground level. Uranium is used for producing nuclear energy which is considered clean energy. Exploration for uranium has also been taken up in several other states in the country with acceptance coming from Northeastern states too. “Accessibility is one reason why exploration has been taken up in Arunachal Pradesh. Secondly, the political situation has made it more conducive to take up such activity for uranium exploration,” chairman and chief executive of Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC) Dinesh Srivastava said. Efforts are also being made for uranium exploration in Himachal Pradesh, while locals in Manipur have also given their nod for exploration. Work is also going in Assam, Nagaland, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, and Jharkhand. “In Jharkhand we were exploring uranium, but also detected gold. Many other precious metals are found when we carry out exploration,” Sinha said. Prospecting for Lithium has also gained significance. Some sites have been identified on the Karnataka-Andhra border, and some sites in Karnataka. “Lithium is a key mineral,” said Sinha pointing out its usage in batteries. NFC CEO Srivastava said work on NFC Kota to produce nuclear fuel bundles used for generating nuclear power was taking place. An amount of Rs 4,200 crore was sanctioned by the Centre for the project. He said the project would be commissioned by end of 2022. “We are self-sufficient in terms of fuel, technology, capacity for our nuclear power plants. In fact, we can also export if it is required,” Srivastava said. “Our quality is the best available in the world,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-a-first-india-exploring-for-uranium-in-arunachal-along-india-china-border/articleshow/81521270.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The petitioners argued that the election commission had denied the right to voters by not conducting elections where single nominations where filed. They argued that voters should be given a chance to cast their vote even in case of single nomination as they still have an option to vote NOTA. The NGO Chittoor Peoples Action Committee (CPAC) has moved court challenging the rule 16 of Andhra Pradesh Panchayat Raj Act. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, advocate Sodum Anvesha told the high court that after introduction of NOTA, rule 16 has become redundant and is contrary to the spirit of democracy. “If the election is not conducted at places where single nomination is filed, this opinion of people will not be reflected in the election which is against the principles of participative democracy,” she said. The high court bench comprising Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice C Praveen Kumar directed the state election commission and the state government to file counter affidavits in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/unanimous-polls-against-voter-rights/articleshow/81517489.cms||Srikanth Aluri

---||Delhi||Delhi: Corporations tighten vigil on burning of leaves||NEW DELHI: Winter may be over, but the task of checking open burning of leaves and garbage is still not over for the corporations. During this season, people burn dry leaves collected on the roadsides and near their houses, which not only leads to pollution but is also a violation of norms. To curb the malpractice and identify defaulters, the three municipal corporations have directed the sanitation department to take immediate action. Those engaged in night sweeping in markets and commercial areas have been asked to keep a vigil on violators. “The sanitation teams are responsible for transporting dry leaves collected after sweeping the roads to 430 composting pits in different parks. These pits are ideally utilised for compositing leaves in parks, but have enough space to accommodate those collected from the roadsides,” said a north corporation official. Since January 1, north corporation has issued nine challans for open burning, imposed Rs 31,500 as fines and persecuted offenders in 12 cases after a visit to 4,346 sites. From October 17, 2020 to March 14 this year, 48 patrolling teams visited 10,683 sites and issued 230 challans, lodged FIRs in two cases and prosecuted 183 violators. Challans worth Rs 11.6 lakh were issued for open burning of waste. A senior East Delhi Municipal Corporation official said the sanitary superintendent in each ward is authorised to impose two types of challans — an NGT challan of Rs 5,000 and for insanitation under Section 397 of DMC Act. The penalty amount in the second case depends on the violation. “No separate teams have been formed. The sanitation workers have been asked to be more vigilant to locate incidents of leaves or garbage burning. We issued 22 challans for open burning from March 1 to 15 and inspected 299 sites after receiving complaints,” added the official. In January, EDMC teams visited 799 sites, issued 12 challans and imposed Rs 1.5 lakh as penalty. In February, they visited 587 sites, imposed three challans and levied a penalty of Rs 30,000. In east Delhi, biodegradable waste collected from the roads and parks is sent to composting plants at eight locations that have a capacity of one tonne per day. South Delhi Municipal Corporation issued 66 challans from January 1 to March 1 and collected Rs 2.7 lakh as penalty. “The violations are less because we kept a tight vigil since October last year. At least 1,492 violators were fined Rs 7.8 lakh for opening burning of leaves/garbage. Our sanitation teams carry out night sweeping in 300 markets,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-tighten-vigil-on-burning-of-leaves/articleshow/81520246.cms||Vibha Sharma

With the win, she became the junior national champion in the women’s cadet recurve category. In June this year, Bari is set to compete in the Olympics qualification round in Paris. An equally solid performance there will book her a berth at the Tokyo Olympics. Bari was 12 years old when her tryst with the bow and arrow started. Her mother, an anganwadi worker, knew a local archery teacher and encouraged her daughter to train under him. “My mother happened to know about the sport and encouraged me to give it a try,” Bari said. She trained for four years (2012-2016) at a ground near her house using makeshift equipment. In 2016, she was able to get into the Tata Archery Academy (TAA) at Jamshedpur. Three years later, Bari became the first Indian to win gold at the 2019 World Archery Youth Championship held in Madrid. Monday’s win once again proved why Bari is a rising star in Indian archery. Her performance in Paris will decide if she will be part of the three-member women’s recurve team which will represent the country at Tokyo Olympics. “Apart from the Olympics qualification round in Paris, I am focusing on the Archery World Cup next month in Guatemala City as well,” Bari told TOI. Her coach at TAA, Purnima Mahato, said, “Her body structure is well-suited to archery. But more importantly, she has a strong mind and is bold, which is why she has a bright future in the sport.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/jamshedpur-to-tokyo-jharkhands-19-year-old-komalika-bari-daughter-of-an-anganwadi-worker-wins-gold-at-41st-junior-national-archery-championship-in-dehradun-eyes-tokyo-olympics/articleshow/81517597.cms||Mohammad Anab

Rao held a meeting on Monday with officials from the state health department and Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic bodies to resolve issues with the region’s vaccination drive, including vaccine stock, delayed data entry and mismatch in inoculation numbers being reported by the state and district headquarters. Rao said the PCMC, currently left with two days’ worth of vaccine stock, was given a fresh batch of 15,000 Covaxin vaccines doses on Monday evening. The supply is enough for three to four days if the pace of vaccination in the twin towns continues at its current pace. “There’s no need to panic. It’s not as if the supply has dried up. The district has sufficient doses,” Rao said. He added the state health department will send enough Covishield supply to ensure those due for their second dose are covered.“But only Covaxin will be used for first doses. As many as 26 new centres were sanctioned for PMC (24) and PCMC (2) on Monday. These centres will be exclusive Covaxin sites,” he said. Rao added that new rules have been set in place to ensure there’s no confusion. He said, “Both PMC and PCMC have been directed to carry out stock-taking at all government hospital sites, which should be converted into Covaxin sites on priority. One of the decisions made was that any replenishment of doses, in case of private hospitals in Pune district, will involve only Covaxin doses and not Covishield. In addition to that, the existing Covishield stock at private hospitals should only be used for second-dose beneficiaries.”The Pune Metropolitan Region has been recording a massive surge in demand for vaccines. Officials with the PMC said an average of nearly 15,000 people are being vaccinated every day. “Private hospitals are being requested to place their orders only as per demand. Details of the jabs and beneficiaries must be submitted to the civic administration. Even information on vaccine wastage has to be shared,” a senior PMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fresh-vax-supply-arrives-to-replenish-districts-reserves/articleshow/81518711.cms||Neha Madaan

The forest officials are claiming that it is for the first time that a jumbo entered the city from the Chilla forest area. They added that all other boundaries are being heavily guarded to stop the entry of elephants into the Kumbh area. “In our records, we don’t have even a single instance wherein an elephant has come from the Chilla forest area, crossed the Ganga and then entered into the city. We have commenced special patrolling in the zone to ensure that jumbos don’t enter the Maha Kumbh area in the future,” said Neeraj Verma, DFO, Haridwar. The incident has triggered concerns regarding the entry of jumbos in the mela area during Kumbh and the possibility of a stampede/mishap. Locals suspect that the jumbo might have come to the area listening to the sound of the jumbos kept by various akhadas for their processions. A senior IFS officer, requesting anonymity, said, “Ideally, patrolling needs to be conducted inside the forest border area so as to ensure that jumbos do not come out. Water facilities should also be ensured on their prime routes so that they don’t venture to the Ganga for water.” Incidentally, out of the 11 jumbos which were to be radio-collared ahead of the Kumbh, only four have undergone the procedure so far. Two jumbos have dropped their collars and another got electrocuted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/jumbo-enters-maha-kumbh-area-forest-department-ramps-up-patrolling/articleshow/81517620.cms||Shivani Azad

Notably, the Union ministry of home affairs had in January 2020 sanctioned dedicated NDRF battalions for Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir. “The NDRF battalion raised for Uttarakhand will have its headquarters in Haldwani. The process of land acquisition for establishing the battalion’s head office is currently underway and the necessary clearances from the state-level departments are being taken,” said Ravi Shankar Badhani, deputy commandant, NDRF. The raising of a dedicated NDRF battalion for Uttarakhand is aimed at strengthening the disaster response set-up in the Himalayan state. “The objective is to reduce the response time keeping in view the hill topography of the state,” said an official of the disaster management department. According to Badhani, there would be a sanctioned strength of 1,149 NDRF personnel in the battalion. "All the necessary equipment needed at the time of a natural disaster will also be made available," he added. Besides the battalion headquarters at Haldwani, five regional emergency centres will also come up in Dehradun, Uttarkashi, Chamoli, Pithoragarh and Haridwar districts. About 100 NDRF personnel will be deployed 24x7 in these regional emergency centres, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/proposed-ndrf-battalion-for-uttarakhand-to-have-its-headquarters-in-haldwani/articleshow/81517621.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The Speaker said that the Question Hour was being given to first-time MLAs only to raise their issues and asked the other more experienced legislators not to intervene. BJP MLA from Govindpura seat Krishna Gaur requested the Speaker to allocate one such Question Hour for women MLAs also. Gaur said 20 women have been elected as members of the House and three are ministers. An opportunity should be given to the ladies to raise their questions exclusively, she said. First-time MLAs who raised their queries included Congress’ Mahesh Parmar from Tarana seat, BJP’s Dharmendra Bhav Singh Lodhi from Jabera, Congress MLAs Bapu Singh Tanwar from Rajgarh, Mevaram Jatav from Gohad, Alok Chaturvedi from Chhatarpur, Ramchandra Dangi from Biaorra, Babu Jandel from Sheopur, Arjun Singh Kakodia from Barghat, Tarwar Singh Lodhi from Banda, Hiralal Alawa from Manawar, Ravi Ramchandra Joshi from Khargone, Sunil Saraf from Kotma, Vijay Revnath Chourey from Sausar and BSP MLA Sanjiv Singh. BSP’s Sanjiv Singh asked minister for revenue Govind Singh Rajput to specify the number of appointments made on compassionate grounds by collector Bhind in the year 2020. The minister said two such appointments were made in the revenue department’s grade 3 category because there was no vacancy in the health and education departments. The legislator told the House that the government’s answer was wrong. “Eighteen appointments were made by the collector in 2020 and the minister is claiming only two,” Sanjiv Singh said. He said that when the whole world was busy fighting Corona crisis, the then district collector of Bhind was busy giving appointments on compassionate grounds. The legislator levelled corruption allegations against the district collector since he made the appointments without taking permission of the government. Revenue minister Rajput said that the collector has the authority to make such appointments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/speaker-allots-question-hour-to-first-time-mlas/articleshow/81517611.cms||---

---||Kolkata||CM’s wheelchair experience will ease their pains, hope people with disabilities||Kolkata: The changes made to the designs of stages and daises to facilitate chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s wheelchair campaign have turned the focus on the challenges faced by persons with disabilities, whose demands for ramps and obstruction-free passages in public places have been brushed aside. A long, wide ramp with a gentle slope, dais with lower floor height, fewer dignitaries on the stage to ensure more floor space and smoothed-out carpets: these are a few modifications that have been made to the stages so that Banerjee can access them on wheelchair without much difficulty. For years, disabled people have been making these very demands but have largely been ignored. Even as they prayed for Banerjee’s speedy recovery, people with disabilities hoped that the CM’s wheelchair experience would finally create awareness on the challenges they faced. “The election commission’s office has directed that all polling booths be on the ground floor for disabled people and ramps with proper gradient be built. But those are yet to be implemented. Now that our CM has been rendered wheelchair-bound, we hope she would understand the importance of a disabled friendly environment,” said disability rights activist Jeeja Ghosh. Ghosh was the brand ambassador and poster girl of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. But she herself had difficulty accessing her polling booth in the absence of a ramp or a railing to help her climb the stairs. “Bengal is one of the worst states for disability accessibility. I hope the CM will understand our pain and do something to improve the situation,” she added. “Forget poll booths and other places, pavements are so uneven and clogged it becomes next to impossible for a blind or wheelchair-bound person to move without support. We will hold a meeting with all parties on March 23 to discuss the disabled rights in their party manifestos. We hope the CM’s injury and temporary immobility create awareness about disabled rights,” said Debajyoti Roy of NIP, an NGO. But most activists said as Banerjee’s injury was temporary, the issue on disability rights might take a backseat soon. “When persons in power themselves undergo temporary disability, they understand the day-to-day struggles faced by a disabled person. But these ultimately do not culminate into policy change. There may be some changes for the specially-abled persons as a knee-jerk reaction but we doubt if this can bring a paradigm change,” said Shuvojit Moulik, founder of Civilian Welfare Foundation, an NGO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cms-wheelchair-experience-will-ease-their-pains-hope-people-with-disabilities/articleshow/81518733.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Addressing the Assembly, Kataria said that farmers in Rajasthan have been doing diverse farming which has been beneficial for the state. The state is first in India in the production of bajra, mustard, isabgol and other crops, and in cumin and fennel seeds, it is on the second position. “This diverse farming will take us forward, as our farmers are not dependent on just one crop. This year, our target is to improve the rainwater harvesting system by spreading awareness about drip irrigation and new schemes will be launched for water management,” said Kataria.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has recently announced that from next year, a separate Budget for agriculture will be made by the state government. Kataria claimed that this first-of-its-kind initiative in the country will give special focus to agriculture in Rajasthan, that will be beneficial to everyone. He further talked about the achievements of the three farmers from the state who were awarded with Padma Shri – Sunda Ram Verma, Hukum Chand and Jagdish Chand Pareek. The minister appreciated the efforts at good farming made by these farmers and said that the rest should learn from them. Kataria later focused on the various technologies being used in helping farmers in doing better agriculture. The minister told the assembly that now, farmers can apply online for licence registration. “Various mobile apps have been created to facilitate farmers. We want technology to be used for their benefit. I will also address the concern over recent hailstorm that has destroyed crops in Hadauti and Shekhawati regions. We conducted assessment of the damage within 72 hours of the hailstorm and very soon, the farmers will be given the required amount of crop insurance,” said Kataria. Talking about the decreasing number of camels in the state, the minister invited suggestions from the Assembly members and said that they have formed a committee that is specially looking after the issue and soon, some solution will be arrived at. He further declared that a sample testing laboratory will be established in Jaipur dedicated to bird flu cases so that the government won’t be dependent on other states for that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/with-tech-water-mgmt-kataria-assures-better-results-in-farming/articleshow/81518728.cms||---

Prakash Ghunghurkar, president of Kolhapur district blood bank association said, “As per central government’s guidelines, the vaccinated person cannot donate blood till completion of four weeks after second dose, which means he cannot donate blood for around three months.

Protesting against the three new agriculture laws, it was the third such gathering in Madhya Pradesh in the last 10 days. The other two were held at Sheopur, where the parliamentary seat of Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar is located, and Rewa in Vindhya Pradesh. All three events witnessed a large number of farmers which discomforted the state government, said Anil Yadav, state general secretary of the BKU in MP. In Sehora, Rakesh Tikait said , “There is no government in India. Corporates are running the show. Over five lakh farmers have been sitting on agitation for the last many months but there is no one to take cognizance of the situation.” He added that there was an “unannounced ban” on the media to show the agitation. Tikait said that the state government in MP also makes huge claims and said there was no agitation among the farmers in the state. He then pointed out at the crowd under the tents and said, “They have shown that the government has been lying”. The BKU alleged that a night before the Mahapanchayat “BJP goons threatened the organizations” and vandalized the venue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bkus-tikait-attends-kisan-mahapanchayat-in-jabalpur-district/articleshow/81518538.cms||---

This is said to be the fourth such incident to have happened on the varsity campus in the past month. “The deer was attacked by the feral dogs near F hostel at around 6:30 pm today in the evening,” said Rohit Kumar Bondugula, a PhD scholar and wildlife activist. He said that there is an urgent need to relocate the feral dogs from the forest. The students alleged that the varsity has cut down many trees, including neem, to construct new buildings at four locations—behind the Centre of Integrated Studies, SIP buildings, behind SN School, and near the Earth Sciences building—due to which most of the wildlife in the university lost its natural habitat. They further added that due to Hyderabad floods in mid-September last year, the boundary walls of the university campus collapsed at different places, which enabled many feral dogs from outside the campus to enter. Reacting on the incident, Vinod Pavarala, spokesperson, UoH, said: “Our security confirmed that the incident happened today. The university has approached GHMC once again to capture the feral dogs that are repeatedly attacking wildlife on campus and help us conserve the wildlife.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/feral-dogs-kill-spotted-deer-at-uoh-4th-in-one-month/articleshow/81518730.cms||---

The mayor said the AAP spokespersons made the flyover a major issue, in which the party had not contributed a single rupee. “They are spreading a new lie about the Rani Jhansi flyover daily. The main reason for the delay is Delhi government. First the Congress government, and then AAP, both have not provided funds for the the project. The departments, such as Public Works Department, DJB and NDPL, are the reasons for the delay, which has led to cost escalations,” he claimed, adding that the Centre had given Rs 85 crore to the municipal corporation for the construction of the flyover. Giving a breakup of the costs related to the project the mayor said, the civic body had spent Rs 124.7 crore on the construction of the flyover, paid Rs 52.1 crore to the railways to construct on its part, Rs 22.9 crore to other departments, including DJB, NDPL BSES.The corporation does not have the right to acquire land, so the civic body paid Rs 79.8 crore to land acquisition collector, Rs 4.1 crore to the high courts, Rs 28.9 crore for railway properties, while the land and estate department of the Centre was paid 29 lakh and Rs 1 crore was paid to St Stephens Hospital. Jai Prakash said AAP had accused the corporation of scam in land acquisition, while the corporation does not have the right to acquire land. Whatever land acquisition payment was made, was done by the land acquisition collector of Delhi government. “If there are any charges, it should be investigated first,” the mayor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-mayor-blames-govt-for-delay-in-flyover-project/articleshow/81520251.cms||---

---||Jaipur||BJP demands CBI probe into phone-tapping allegations||JAIPUR: The BJP on Monday came down heavily on the Ashok Gehlot government after it recently uploaded on the assembly website that it tapped phones in the interest of public safety and order. The reaction was the state government’s reply to a question asked by BJP MLA Kalicharan in the Assembly last year. Though the reply did not say it tapped phones of Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhwat and supporters of former deputy CM Sachin Pilot after a rebellion in the Congress last year, the BJP demanded a CBI probe into it. Reacting to it, Shekhawat, who was accused of toppling the Gehlot government in July 2020 in connivance with Congress MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma said, “Gehlot acted like a saint then. He should now respond to the issue. He has misused government machinery to settle the power struggle within his party.” Reacting to it, BJP state president Satish Poonia demanded a CBI probe claiming the reply was contradictory to repeated denials of tapping phones by Gehlot, then chief secretary and senior officers. Poonia said the question by MLA Saraf was in connection with the allegations of phone tapping of elected representatives that appeared widely in the media by the government during the power struggle in Congress (June and July 2020). “Phone tapping is not an ordinary issue. Gehlot while defending the allegations had repeatedly lied in the assembly. We sought his response on news reports highlighting the same, but he gave false assurances. Even Congress MLAs then had demanded NIA investigation fearing phone-tapping. Only a CBI probe can reveal the ill intentions of the government,” said Poonia. However, the government is still in denial mode. A senior official in the home department said, “No permission was given to the investigative agencies to intercept the phones of public representatives, be it MLA, MP or any minister.” “Permission for phone interception (of any person) is given as per the provisions laid down under Section 5(2) of The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and Section 419 (A) of The Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules, 2007,” said home secretary N L Meena. Calling the phone tapping episode part of the Congress government’s set practice of curbing dissent, Jaipur Rural MP Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said, “In a bid to save the government from falling, Congress tapped the phones of opposition leaders and people. The admission of spying is illegal and gross misuse of the powers.” Saraf, in a starred question in the last session (August, 2020) of Rajasthan assembly had asked, “Is it true that phone tapping cases have come to the fore in the last days? If yes, then under which law and on whose orders? Place complete details on the table of the House.” In its response, which was posted on the state assembly’s website, the government gave a reply stating: “Interception of the telephone has been done by Rajasthan Police under the above-mentioned provisions having obtained permission from the competent officer.” However, the government’s reply to Saraf did not mention that the phones of any public representative – MLAs and MPs - were tapped. In fact, the reply didn’t mention the telephone numbers or names of persons whose phones have been intercepted. The government’s reply further stated, “Interception cases are reviewed as per rules under the chairmanship of chief secretary of Rajasthan. All cases up to November 2020 have been reviewed.” TOI had reported on July 20, 2020, that the state government didn’t intercept the phones of any public representative – MLAs and MPs - but only tapped the mobile of middleman Sanjay Jain, who was subsequently arrested for purportedly plotting to dislodge the Ashok Gehlot government. The Union home ministry, too, had sought a report on the Jain phone interception case from then chief secretary Rajeeva Swarup. The report was sent to the government of India on July 21. The state slipped into a political crisis in July 2020 after the Congress party released the audio clips where Jain was heard allegedly talking to Congress MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma and Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. In one of the recordings of phone conversations, former Rajasthan tourism minister Vishvendra Singh’s voice could also be allegedly heard. According to the source, only Sanjay Jain’s phone was intercepted and he was heard talking to Congress MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma and Union minister Shekhawat. The phones of these two people were not intercepted, the source had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-demands-cbi-probe-into-phone-tapping-allegations/articleshow/81518732.cms||---

---||Pune||Despite minor lags, sites across region record steady jab turnouts||Pune: Monday’s vaccination data showed good turnouts in the Pune Metropolitan Region despite the rejig in dosage plan in some parts. A total of 26,560 people got their jabs in the district on Monday. The number includes elderly, people aged 45 and above with comorbidities, health workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs). The total also includes the 5,010 HCWs and FLWs who given second doses. Around 14,574 people were vaccinated in PMC limits. Some 10,532 were given the first dose of Covishield, while around 349 were given Covaxin as their first jab. On Sunday, the local administration had urged hospitals to start administering Covaxin as the first dose. Private hospitals that tried to purchase stock of Covaxin from the PMC experienced problems that led to delayed distribution of the shot. Only three hospitals — Bharati, Global and Sanjeevani (in PMC limits) — were able to administer Covaxin. The rest (82 out of the 85 sites) used Covishield stock.  Rebecca John, assistant medical director, Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “We have received Covaxin doses for Tuesday. We could not start giving Covaxin on Monday as we received the doses late and were unable to create a session site on time. From Tuesday, we will be giving Covaxin to first-time beneficiaries Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital board of India, said confusion over doses can impact the drive. “Authorities should ensure the process is streamlined as soon as possible,” he said. State immunization officer, DN Patil, said the Centre is encouraging use of Covaxin. “There is no choice of Covishield or Covaxin when it comes to first dose. Hospitals, civic bodies will have to vaccinate as per availability,” Patil said. Ayush Prasad, CEO of the Pune zilla parishad, said, “Earlier, we had a Covaxin site only at District Aundh Hospital. But with the new supply, we will add more Covaxin centres,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/despite-minor-lags-sites-across-region-record-steady-jab-turnouts/articleshow/81518790.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Chennai||Rip current exit strategy is to go with the flow||By V S ChandrasekaranLast December, a 55-year-old software engineer drowned in the sea off Thiruvanmiyur while trying to save his 11-year-old daughter. He was pulled in by the strong current as he was not aware of how to navigate it.As summer nears and the scare of Covid-19 wanes, more people are heading out to the beaches for a dip in the sea. But without training and knowledge, the threat of drowning also increases. While the lockdown kept the numbers low last year, police records show around 20 people drowned off the Marina in 2019. Though tides, waves and topography aids these currents, rip currents can form anywhere. And awareness about them is the best possible preventive strategy. Rip currents are a potential source of danger for people in shallow water with breaking waves, whether in the sea or in lakes.Leisure sea-bathers drowning and their bodies being found far away from the site where they were, even when they were in hip-deep or chest-deep waters, indicates that rip currents at play. A rip current is a specific kind of water current that occurs near beaches with breaking waves. A rip is a strong, localised, and narrow current of water which moves away from the shore, cutting through the lines of breaking waves like a river running out to sea. Swimmers who are caught in a rip current and who do not understand what is happening, often panic or exhaust themselves by trying to swim against the flow of water. Because of these factors, rip currents are the leading cause of rescues by lifeguards at beaches.Contrary to popular belief, a rip cannot pull a person down and hold him/her under the water. It simply carries floating objects, including people, out to just beyond the zone of the breaking waves, at which point the current dissipates and releases everything it is carrying. It typically flows at 0.5m/s, but can be as fast as 2.5 m/s, which is faster than any human can swim. However, most rip currents are fairly narrow, and even the widest rip currents are not very wide, so getting out of one only takes a few strokes.Usually swimmers can exit it by swimming at a right angle to the flow, parallel to the beach. The flow of the current also fades out completely at the head of the rip, outside the zone of the breaking waves, so there is a definite limit to how far the swimmer will be taken out to sea. In such as situation, death by drowning occurs when a person has limited water skills and panics, or when a swimmer persists in trying to swim to shore against the current, eventually becoming exhausted and drowning.An eye for identifying the rip current is essential as they have a characteristic appearance, and, with some experience, they can be visually identified from the shore before entering the water. This is useful to lifeguards, swimmers, surfers, boaters, divers, who may need to avoid a rip, or in some cases make use of the flow. It often looks somewhat like a road or river running out to the sea, and they are easiest to notice and identify when the zone of breaking waves is viewed from a high vantage point. Much foam being carried out to sea in one narrow strip of water is often a visible sign of a rip current. It is like a moving treadmill.Once out of the rip current, getting back to shore is also not difficult, since waves are breaking, and floating objects (including swimmers) will be pushed by the waves towards the shore. As an alternative, people who are caught in a strong rip can simply relax and go with the flow (either floating or treading water) until the current dissipates beyond the surf line. Then the person can signal for help, or swim back through the surf, doing so diagonally, away from the rip and towards the shore.It is necessary for coastal swimmers not only to understand the danger of rip currents, but to learn how to recognise them, and how to deal with them. While Tamil Nadu with its long coastline has planned watch towers and patrols its tourist spots, the message is aimed at dissuading people from entering the sea, but the better communication would be to put up boards in different languages and diagrams explaining why and how currents work, so that people are equipped with the knowledge..(The writer is a retired principal scientist, ICAR-CIBA, Chennai)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rip-current-exit-strategy-is-to-go-with-the-flow/articleshow/81518756.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Fallen for fraud call? Bank not liable to pay you: court||Ahmedabad: Despite repeated words of caution by banks against fraud, if one falls for a fake call and loses money from the account, the bank is not liable to compensate for the loss. This is what a consumer court said, while denying compensation to the victim of a bank fraud. Kurji Javia, a retired teacher from Nana Akadiya, a small village in Amreli district, fell victim to such a fraud. Javia, who now practises law, got a call on April 2, 2018 from a scamster who identified himself as a State Bank of India manager. Javia gave him details related to his ATM card. The next day, as soon as Rs 39,358 was deposited towards his pension in the bank account, he got a message that Rs 41,500 had been withdrawn. Javia sued the bank seeking compensation, saying he had made frantic calls to SBI’s Nagnath branch immediately after the money was withdrawn but got no response. Claiming that the bank could have prevented his loss, he demanded his lost amount back along with Rs 30,000 as compensation for harassment. Later, it was revealed that the fraudsters used the amount to shop online. The Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission in Amreli rejected Javia’s complaint, saying that he did not followed the word of caution and guidelines for safe transactions issued by the bank and, therefore, he was not eligible for compensation. The consumer court said that it was negligence on part of the complainant as customers are warned and instructed by the bank through advisories, guidelines on notice boards, as well as through instructions mentioned on the ATM cards. It is also instructed through advertisements that a bank account holder must not share details about account numbers, debit and credit cards, OTP number and personal information with anybody on phone because bank authorities do not ask for such details. “Yet a teacher and a practising advocate like the complainant parted with information with a stranger and admitted to it. This does not reflect any negligence or deficiency in service on part of the bank,” the order reads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fallen-for-fraud-call-bank-not-liable-to-pay-you-court/articleshow/81518800.cms||---

He added that he has never judged them on basis of their castes.Madan Dilawar, former minister and BJP MLA from Ramganj Mandi, was speaking about crops destroyed by hailstorm during Zero Hour. When the MLA started reading out the names of villages affected by hailstorm, the Speaker asked Dilawar to make it short and state his constituency. But when Dilwar continued to read out the names of the villages, Joshi stopped him.Dilawar said it is a farmers’ issue and blamed the Speaker of caste discrimination. “You are stopping me as I belong to SC,” he said. This infuriated Joshi. He sought opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria’s intervention and said, “The member is levelling allegations against the chair and I will not tolerate it. For me all members of the House are equal.”Joshi added that he would not tolerate this kind of behaviour. The members must follow rules and directions of the Speaker. Joshi added that he will not allow such members to speak in the House either.Some days back a few Congress MLAs including former minister Ramesh Meena had also accused the Speaker of discriminating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/speaker-clarifies-on-accusation-of-discrimination/articleshow/81518772.cms||---

A similar plan of the Karnataka transport undertaking — which was thinking about restarting the long-route buses to Maharashtra — also hit a roadblock. The MSRTC has sought protection for its buses from the Karnataka state. The Karnataka transport undertaking too has demanded protection for its buses travelling to Maharashtra. Rohan Palange, the MSRTC divisional controller, said: “Both the transport undertakings are in touch with each other to resume the bus services. After the incident of a youth being beaten up by the Karnataka police was reported, the local police administration requested us to put our plans on hold. We have sought police protection for our buses travelling to Belagavi, around 100 km from Kolhapur. If we get some assurance, then we can restart the buses.” Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena has given a deadline of March 20 to the Karnataka government to remove the Kannada flag hoisted outside the Belagavi City Corporation illegally by a pro-Kannada group. The workers of the group — Kannada Rakshana Vedike — had allegedly attacked a car of Shiv Sena’s Belagavi district president Prakash Shirolkar. Shirolkar had attended a press conference at Kolhapur and said the Maharashtra government must take proactive steps to stop the attacks on Marathi people. Vijay Devane, the Kolhapur district president of Shiv Sena, said, “We will not keep quiet if the attacks on Marathi-speaking people continue to take place in Karnataka. We demand the removal of the flag by March 20. If that is not done, then we will adopt any measure possible to get it removed. If the flag is not removed, then no Kannada-speaking person will be allowed to run any business in Maharashtra.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/brakes-on-maha-ktaka-bus-service-resumption-plans/articleshow/81518780.cms||---

---||Jaipur||After Covid vaccine shot, people rush to clinics to check antibodies||JAIPUR: A lot of people after being vaccinated against Covid-19 are making a beeline at diagnostic centres with curiosity of finding how much antibodies have they developed after receiving the two doses. Around 30 lakh doses have been given to the beneficiaries since the launch of vaccination drive from January 16. Aiming to find out if the vaccine has given them the freedom to move freely without worries, a lot of beneficiaries are opting for the antibodies test. “I have received two doses of Covid vaccine. I just want to check if I have sufficient antibodies. For the purpose, we have antibodies test, which gives an idea if my immune system is now efficient to prevent infection,” said a healthcare staff of a private hospital. However, health experts have some different opinion on beneficiaries opting for antibodies test after getting vaccinated. “The antibodies test might give you a false confidence and security if it shows encouraging results. However, if shows insufficient antibodies, it may discourage you. The antibodies test is good for research purposes, if someone is doing it for curiosity then I think it is not recommended,” Dr Prakash Keswani, senior professor (medicine), SMS Hospital, who is part of the core group of doctors for Covid treatment. He said in different persons, the level of antibodies developed after vaccination is different, so it does not mean that inoculation is effective in some persons and in others it is not so much effective. “People should get vaccinated and just don’t bother about antibodies,” he said. Doctors also appealed to people to follow Covid protocol even if they are vaccinated completely. “According to the protocol, people should continue using face masks and other protocols like they have been following before vaccination,” said Dr Sheetu Singh, director Covid pulmonary rehab at a private hospital. Besides, at SMS Hospital, the microbiology department is conducting a research on antibodies developed after Covid vaccination. “The research is almost complete and soon we will be able to reveal the data in research journal,” said an SMS Hospital’s microbiology department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/beneficiaries-test-antibodies-after-vaccine/articleshow/81518794.cms||---

Even 40 days after the board had passed a unanimous resolution to study the feasibility of the free water supply, the SCB has not started the exercise. The resolution passed on January 30 mandates a detailed study on the phase-wise installation of water meters in the Cantonment area. But the resolution is gathering dust as the SCB staff is busy preparing the electoral rolls for the elections to the Cantonment board, the MLC polls and the Swachh Survekshan programme. Officials said that they don’t have enough manpower to take up the study. It may be recalled that the SCB had made several attempts in the past to fix water meters and issue accurate monthly bills. But it was unable to accomplish the task. “According to the official records available with SCB water wing officials, there are over 15,000 registered consumed. The study will reveal whether the residents are willing to fix the water meters,” an SCB official told TOI. “Before fixing water meters, SCB should ensure uninterrupted water supply as per the schedule. We never know when the water comes and at what time,” said Bhaskar Reddy, a resident of Bowenpally. Meanwhile, an RWA in Trimulgherry said that though they welcome the government’s move to supply free water, the SCB has to bear the burden of fixing the meters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/free-water-may-be-delayed-no-study-on-fixing-meters/articleshow/81518798.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Mumbai||Diesel sales dip 15%, petrol unchanged in Mumbai||Mumbai: High fuel prices have now hit diesel sales, which have plummeted at least 15% at the pumps in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, according to Petrol Dealers’ Association. Association secretary Chetan Modi said, “There is a significant drop in the number of trucks, trailers, tempos, tourist buses, Ola and Uber cabs, and dumper trucks arriving at over 200 pumps in the region. They would come in large numbers to fill diesel but now the numbers have fallen.” Sources in the association said the average sales of diesel per pump every month were around 200 kilolitres, which, of late, have come down to 165-170 kilolitres. The reason: Several tourist buses are not plying due to Covid restrictions or drop in passengers, many goods transporter firms are hit, there is a drop in the number of truck arrivals, and a lot of Ola and Uber cabs have switched to CNG. “We are witnessing vehicles converted from diesel to CNG, especially aggregator cabs and a few private cars,” said a pump owner from Ghatkopar. Ravi Shinde, former president of the association, said the business of several transport companies in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai was impacted during the Covid pandemic. On the other hand, petrol sales are not hit and, on an average, 300 kilolitres of the fuel is being sold at most pumps every month—considered profitable, sources said. The price of petrol and diesel, though, has not gone up by a single paise for over a fortnight after a series of hikes earlier this year. The last hike of petrol was on February 27 to Rs 97.57 per litre and diesel Rs 88.60.  Mahendra Arya, president, All India Transporters Welfare Association, said, “There are over 11,000 operators in the state who have incurred losses to the tune of crores. These are bad times for the transport sector, where we have demanded rollback on taxes, VAT on diesel, withdrawal of toll and revising the e-way bill system.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/diesel-sales-dip-15-petrol-unchanged-in-mumbai/articleshow/81518970.cms||Somit Sen

Amit Kumar, Sonia Thakur and Arshiya Chaudhary will join the camp that will prepare them for the Youth World Championship, scheduled to be organised later this year. Notably, the archers had lost everything, including their equipment, in the Shatabdi Express fire near Haridwar on Saturday. Archers Amit Kumar and Sonia Thakur and their coaches spent a sleepless night fine-tuning their equipment that the state sports department had hurriedly arranged for them in the wake of the fire. They won three medals for Madhya Pradesh on Sunday. Their chief coach, Ricchpal Singh, said, “National federation will announce their names formally in the next couple of days. They have played very well in the championship.” On Saturday, the archers were in Shatabdi’s C5 coach with their coach when the fire broke out. While the train was evacuated and everyone got out safely, the archers lost all their equipment and clothes in the blaze. In the girls' recurve category, Sonia won a silver medal with 642 points. In the boys' category, Amit scored 665 to win bronze. In the recurve mixed team event, the duo won silver.

---||Mumbai||Two offices premises of ex-CM Sushil Kumar Shinde’s daughter attached||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has provisionally attached two office premises worth Rs 34 crore of former chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde’s daughter Priti and her husband Raj Shroff in a money laundering case linked to Housing Development & Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) promoters. It is alleged that HDIL promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and his son Sarang defrauded Yes Bank by obtaining loans fraudulently and laundered the money. Two companies promoted by Priti and Raj had purchased the office premises at half the market rate a few years ago, thus helping the Wadhawans in money laundering, alleged the ED. The attached offices are situated in Kaledonia building near Andheri station (east). There are a few other politicians who had purchased office premises in the building at discounted rates and the ED is inquiring about it. Earlier, the ED had arrested two directors of Virar-based Viva Group — Mehul Thakar, a relative of Vasai MLA Hitendra Thakur, and chartered accountant Madan Gopal Chaturvedi in the case, as their group company had purchased two office premises in the same building after issuing a cheque of Rs 34 crore which was never encashed. ED alleged that by purchasing premises at half of market rates, he helped Wadhawans in money laundering. Shroff and his wife Priti have two companies, Orlando Trading Pvt Ltd and Jindal Combines Pvt Ltd that purchased the two premises in the Andheri building. In 2014, they had purchased office premises of around 14,000 sq ft on the 5th floor of the building for Rs 9.4 crore, for which they paid Rs 8 crore as compared to Rs 15.6 crore, if one goes by the ready reckoner rate. In 2016, they purchased another office space situated on the third floor of the building with the same area for Rs 18 crore but paid only Rs 10 crore. The ready reckoner rate of the space then was Rs 20 crore. Shroff told ED officials that there was an understanding that he would pay the balance amount once the builder fulfilled the commitment.  When ED asked Shroff about the huge price difference between two offices that measure the same, he reportedly told them that the third floor premises had better ventilation. But Shroff has been receiving more rent for the fifth floor office (Rs 14 lakh a month) than the third floor (Rs 11 lakh), said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-offices-premises-of-ex-cm-shindes-daughter-attached/articleshow/81520320.cms||Vijay V Singh

All the higher-ups are required to make frontline workers aware of the benefits of immunization,” Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan said. Police personnel, home guards, paramilitary personnel,government employees, municipal workers and disaster management professionals are categorized under frontline workers.Beside frontline workers, around 29% healthcare workers from Aurangabad are yet to get the first dose of the vaccine even though the immunization drive began on January 16. Government authorities said paramedical staff and Anganwadi workers, listed under health worker category, were showing reluctance towards getting vaccinated.“Despite repeated appeals, certain section of health workers are not keen to take the vaccine out of fear and misconceptions. We would like to appeal to them again to undergo immunization as the vaccine is safe and has significant efficacy,” Neeta Padalkar, health officer with local civic body, said. A total of 28 vaccination centres are currently administering Covid vaccination in Aurangabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/frontline-workers-told-to-take-covid-jabs-in-2-days/articleshow/81518802.cms||---

Police had resorted to cane charge and many agitators and cops were hurt in the struggle. The protest was held to push the demand for widening of a 19-km-long road which the state government had promised. On the sidelines of an event, CM Tirath Singh Rawat said that raising voice for a genuine demand is the right of a person and all the cases registered against people, who did not break the law, would be withdrawn. “At the same time, we will ensure that the road widening work from Ghat to Nandprayag is completed at the earliest,” the CM said. Meanwhile, the residents of the area have continued with their protests over the issue. For a long time, the locals have been demanding the widening of the 19-km stretch from Ghat to Nandprayag in Chamoli district. Three months back, former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat had gone to the area and announced that the road widening work would commence soon. After waiting for nearly a month, the locals launched protests and hunger strikes over the issue. They had even formed a 19-km long human chain during one of their protests. However, after their protests failed to draw any response from the authorities, around 2,000 residents staged a protest on March 1 – the first day of the budget session. The protesters broke the barricading at Jungle Chatti – which is around 8-km from the assembly building at Bhararisain. Thereafter, another major protest was witnessed at Diwalikhal, which is 4-km ahead of the assembly premises. The protest had turned violent as a result of which, the police had to resort to cane charge. Around 350 people, including 40 identified protestors, were booked for violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-to-withdraw-cases-filed-against-ghat-block-residents-who-protested-near-gairsain-assembly-building-during-budget-session/articleshow/81517711.cms||Kautilya Singh

So far, violators were either fined under the Epidemic Diseases Act or the Disaster Management Act, or police cases were filed against them. Entry only to those wearing masks, temperature checks using a handheld device at the entrance of premises and sanitisers at convenient locations in the premises are among the rules that private establishments have been asked to strictly follow. Multiplexes and restaurants have been allowed to function at 50% capacity, and allowing more than the stipulated number will also amount to violation. The government has also asked these establishments to ensure the presence of enough manpower to enforce the mask rule as well as social distancing. The notification will be in force till March 31. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had a meeting with representatives of malls, theatres and restaurants last week and warned them that there were many complaints against their members over non-compliance with Covid protocol. He told them if things did not improve, the state would have no choice but to order strict restrictions that will hamper their business,” said an official. All social, cultural, religious and political gatherings will continue to be suspended till March 31, which means Holi will have to be a low-key affair in the state. Weddings should not have more than 50 people and not more than 20 people can participate in a funeral. To crack down on those violating home quarantine and home isolation rules, the state has said if those with a home quarantine stamp are found to be moving around, they will be taken to Covid care centres. “There have been many instances where people with a home quarantine stamp are found to be out and about, and this has also led to spread of infection among others,” said an official. Even private offices, which have been allowed to function at 50% capacity, will be shut down if they are found flouting Covid-appropriate norms.

Earlier in the day, parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal had announced in the assembly that the state government would dismiss him from service using its powers under Article 311 of the Constitution, leaving aside all procedures, and had initiated the process. He had said the state government was treating it as a “rarest of rare case”. Dhariwal told the assembly that ACP Bohra of special cell, crimes against women, has been accused of asking money and seeking sexual favours in exchange for taking action in a rape case. The CBI had also investigated charges against the police officer earlier, he said. Dhariwal was replying after the issue was raised by deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Singh Rathore during the Zero Hour. The minister said the decision on dismissal was delayed as there were two opinions on invoking Article 311 of the Constitution. While the procedure for dismissal must be followed, in such a rarest of rare case, the government can start proceedings directly invoking Article 311 of the Constitution under section 16(2) of the Rajasthan Civil Services Rules, 1958, he said. Opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria welcomed the decision but asked the government how a person, accused of serious charges, was given field posting, that too in the sensitive special cell of crimes against women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cop-who-sought-sexual-favoursfrom-rape-survivor-suspended/articleshow/81520407.cms||---

A lot of patients coming to hospitals and clinics are suffering from Covid-like symptoms, but turn out negative when tested. Doctors are attributing the rise in ordinary viral infections to change in weather. “Registration of patients at out-patient department (OPD) has gone up in the recent past due to increase in cases of other viral infections,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer, Jaipur (I). Patients are coming to hospitals with high-grade fever, cough and cold, which are also the symptoms of Covid. “A lot of patients are coming with Covid-like symptoms but they test negative for the virus. A lot of such non-Covid patients are reaching hospitals for treatment. On the basis of their contact history and clinical examination, we try to differentiate between Covid patients and those with common viral infection,” said Dr Prakash Keswani, senior professor (medicine), SMS Hospital, who is part of the core group of doctors for Covid treatment. Doctors have to tread cautiously as the state has started reporting more Covid infections daily over the past one month. “I have seen a sudden spike in cases of high-grade fever, cough and cold patients. One family is having multiple such cases. In such cases, fever subsides in 3 to 5 days with medication. It is a situation wherein people should remain cautious as cases of Covid have also been increasing. Most of such patients do not want to get the Covid test done. As a precaution, I get X-ray and other tests done of the patients after 3-5 days of fever, to ensure that the patients do not have any impact on lungs or any other complication. Majority of the patients recovering from fever in 3-5 days do not show any impact on lungs in X-ray,” said Dr Adil Aziz, senior consultant (medicine) at a private hospital. Since common viral fever is also contagious, doctors advise people to keep following Covid protocol like wearing face masks, avoid gathering in crowded places, follow social distancing and also to be alert while attending crowded wedding ceremonies and other such events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/viral-infection-mimicking-covid-symptoms-on-the-rise-docs/articleshow/81518809.cms||---

The captivating lines were recited during the session, ‘Kavita Shaad Karti Hai’ of Metaphor The Lucknow Lit Fest. Shaad, who hails from Lucknow, and renowned singer Kavita Seth made the evening sublime with their ghazals and shayari, followed by a candid discussion. Shaad also recited his composition to share his feelings on leaving Lucknow and relocating to Jalandhar (Punjab). “Naye ghar ko sajane me lage hain...purana ghar bohot yaad aata hai. Lucknow is such a city that no person can really leave it. Even when I shifted to another city, the people in Lucknow stayed connected to me all these years. I never felt away,” said Shaad. Sharing her views on singers today, Seth said, “These days, young singers are open to all kinds of compositions. They don’t know what they want and they don’t really look for work which has deep meaning. That is why there are not many good Sufi singers here. For becoming a sufi singer, the artists need to connect emotionally with the words and also become a bit selective.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-is-a-city-no-one-can-ever-leave-behind-poet-shaad/articleshow/81520302.cms||Aditi Singh

Doon’s Sudhanshu Bisht and Kartik Rana, both 20 years old, were selected to train at the prestigious Sports Authority of India, Sonepat for their feats at the event. Bisht secured the fifth rank while Rana clinched the 18th spot in the Men’s archery event. Speaking to TOI, the duo said, “We gained interest in archery when we joined the Social Baluni Public School together at class 8. Over there, we learnt the sport. Now we have shifted to universities in other states since there is no university in Uttarakhand which offers archery training.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/41st-junior-national-archery-championship-concludes-in-doon/articleshow/81517718.cms||Mohammad Anab

The latest addition of one lakh tests comes in seven days. The PMR’s test tally had crossed 24 lakh mark on March 7. Among the PMR constituents, the PMC areas are testing around 8,000 to 9,000 samples every day now, which was in the range of 4,000 a month ago. Similarly, daily tests in the PCMC and rural areas have increased by around 4,000 to 5,000. Health officials said they have told the staff to engage in rigorous contact tracing and testing in vulnerable zones. “We have ramped up swab collection in the city. About 20 swab centres are operational now and the private labs are also conducting tests. The city has been reporting more than 1,000 cases with increased testing,” said Sanjeev Wavre, assistant medical chief at Pune Municipal Corporation. According to health experts, more testing helps identify positive patients early on, which helps in avoiding further disease spread. “Though the cases have gone up in the last few weeks, many patients have only mild symptoms. It is crucial that all the people developing flu-like symptoms get themselves tested and get isolate, if they are positive, to prevent further spread of the virus,” health official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/daily-testing-doubles-in-a-month-total-goes-past-25l/articleshow/81518819.cms||Sarang Dastane

Bank employees are on a two-day strike, protesting the proposed privatization of two state-owned lenders. As the strike days coincided with bank holidays on Saturday (second Saturday) and Sunday, banks will effectively remain closed for four days. The strike has impacted various transactions including cheque clearance, loan approval, withdrawal, and issuance of letter of credit. While ATMs were expected to function as usual, the strike led to a few PSB ATMs running dry on Monday, as transfer of cash from the vault to the individual machines was hampered. Listing reasons for the protest, Janak Rawal, general secretary of Maha Gujarat Bank Employees’ Association, said, “Various social objectives of the government aimed at financial inclusion and easing of credit are addressed by PSBs and not private banks. That apart, interest on deposits will also decline and subsidized loans will also be stopped, especially for priority sector.” “Already a number of bank branches have been rationalized with an eye on privatization. Merger of banks in the past and further privatization of PSBs will only add to it. As a consequence, overall opportunities for employment in the banking sector will also significantly go down,” Rawal added. The Union Finance Minister had announced plans for privatization of two PSBs during the budget speech. Some 100 PSB employees gathered at the Lal Darwaza branch of Central Bank of India in Ahmedabad on Monday morning to hold demonstrations in support of the strike. Similar demonstrations were held at various locations in Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Bhavnagar and Jamnagar. Box mailed: Bank Closure March 13-16 Strike: March 15-16 PSB Branches shut: 5,000 Employees participating: 60,000 Transaction impact: Rs 20,000 crore||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/60000-bank-employees-strike-work-services-hit/articleshow/81518833.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

AGD, law and order, Prashant Kumar said that as many as 20 districts have been identified as hyper-sensitive, where Rapid Action Force (RAF) will be deployed from this week. “The move is to ensure that Holika dahan is done peacefully. There are 1.4 lakh spots across the state for the ceremony on March 27. Last year, 19 minor incidents during Holika dahan were reported,” said the officer. The officer added that since 2016, there has been considerable decrease in such incidents though. “As many as 97 incidents were reported in 2016,” said the officer, adding that over the past few years, measures have been taken to avert incidents pertaining to the festival. “These include monitoring by drones, deployment of RAF, and dividing districts into categories of hyper-sensitive and sensitive,” said the ADG. Districts in the hyper-sensitive category are: Agra, Aligarh, Prayagraj, Ambedkarnagar, Azamgarh, Bahraich, Balrampur, Bareilly, Bulandshahr, Ayodhya, Gonda, Gorakhpur, Kanpur Nagar, Lucknow, Mau, Meerut, Moradabad, Shravasti, Varanasi, and Sambhal. In these districts, companies of PAC have been deployed along with local forces and fire department. “Police chiefs of all these districts have been asked to maintain vigilance, while all those accused in incidents previously should be under watch or served notices,” said the ADG. He also said that pending investigation in any case must be prioritised by the police chief and probe must be completed. He cited how it is challenging to manage processions in certain districts like in Shahjahanpur where cops have been asked to deploy adequate forces. In Mohollah Masitganj locality, on the day of Holi, a procession is taken out where a man is made to sit on a bullock cart and sprinkled with colours, and also garlanded with shoes. Another such challenging procession is taken out in Asmauli area of Sambhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/raf-to-be-deployed-in-20-hyper-sensitive-dists-for-holika-dahan/articleshow/81520368.cms||---
---||Agra||Temperature soars to 35 degrees in Agra region, relief likely later this week||AGRA: The temperature in Agra region soared past the comfort level to touch 35 degree Celsius on Monday, three notches above the normal level. At 17.1 degree Celsius, the minimum temperature also remained 3 degrees above normal. According to the metrological department, there is a possibility of rainfall and thunderstorms later this week. Last year, on March 15, the maximum temperature in Agra was 24.7 degree Celsius and minimum was 16.4 degrees. Agriculture department officials fear that the rapid increase in temperature can adversely affect wheat crops which would be ready for harvest in next 10 days. Soaring mercury level may result in shirking of the grain. Wheat is a major crop in Agra district. Currently 1.32 lakh hectare land is under wheat crop cultivation. “This year, the temperature has been staying above normal limits since February 15. The average temperature in the first half of March has been higher as compared to at least last five years. The high temperature along with the westerly winds is harmful for the wheat crop. Vegetable and fruit crops may also get affected,” said a senior agriculture officer. With low humidity both minimum and maximum temperature across the UP was recorded above normal limits on Monday. According to the meteorological department officials, the temperature is likely to increase further in the next two weeks. As compared to Agra, the temperature remained slightly low in Aligarh, Bareilly and Meerut. The maximum temperature in Aligarh was recorded 32.4 degrees, 31.4 degrees in Bareilly and 30.8 degrees in Meerut. In Lucknow, the mercury level on maximum scale was recorded 33.3 degrees and 34.5 degrees in Varanasi. According to the meteorological department, there is a possibility of one or two spells of rain or thunderstorms on March 18 and 19. The minimum temperature in the Agraregion is likely to increase by five degree Celsius by March 21. Agra’s district agriculture officer Rampravesh Verma said, “A rise in temperature is not good for wheat crops as it may have an impact on the yield, especially on the late sown crop. Light irrigation should be done in the evening to prevent the impact of adverse weather conditions on the crop. Farmers are advised to keep monitoring their fields and report if they detect yellow rust in the crop.” Yellow rust is a fungal disease which manifests as powdery yellow stripes on leaves. These stripes hinder photosynthesis, make the grain shrivel and stop the growth of the plant. Meanwhile, speedy winds resulted drop in pollution level. The air quality (AQI) index in Agra was recorded at 188 (moderate category) by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/temperature-soars-to-35-degrees-in-agra-region-relief-likely-later-this-week/articleshow/81516741.cms||Deepak Lavania

A senior official said field staff would now urge more people to get vaccinated and that the current situation was conducive to convince fence-sitters. “A number of corporation staff have been deputed for poll duty and spreading awareness to increase polling. They will be going from door to door as well as visiting public places like parks to persuade people to get the shots,” he added. Several teams have started vigorous campaigns to increase the vaccination figures. This comes at a time when the number of active cases in the city crossed 2,000 on Monday evening. The corresponding zone-wise will be released on Tuesday morning. The corporation has so far vaccinated 2.82 lakh people, with more than 20,000 getting the first dose on Saturday. People above the age of 60 and those between 45 and 60 with co-morbidities have been getting the vaccine free of cost at all corporation Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs) as well as at some Amma mini-clinics. Many citizens have given notes of appreciation for the clean interiors of government premises as well as the cordial behaviour of the health staff. An official from a zone in central Chennai said the civic body had started increasing surveillance in marriage halls, theatres and other places where more number of people were crowding. “Spot fines are being issued if masking is not adequate. We also ask people to distribute masks,” he said. The corporation has also started cross-checking samples tested in private laboratories to ensure there are no false positives. Zonal level staff have been asked to avoid putting up barricades outside homes or streets where three or more cases are found, but a few banners are being stuck outside houses where more than one case is detected. “This is a precautionary measure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rise-in-covid-19-cases-drives-corpn-vaccination-campaign/articleshow/81518830.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

Chief metropolitan magistrate Dr Pankaj Sharma, in the meantime, granted bail to Aquib Hussain, Mujeeb Hussain Gattoo, Muneeb Hussain Gattoo, Umar Gul, Rayees Rasool, Bashrat Ali and Khalid Bashir Bhatt. Among other grounds, their counsels had sought bail on the ground that they all had been chargesheeted without arrest. “Considering the grounds mentioned in the applications on behalf of the accused persons, they are admitted to be released on bail on furnishing of personal bond in the sum of Rs 25,000 each with one surety of the like amount. Bail bonds furnished and accepted,” the court said. Advocate Sushil Bajaj, who appeared for Kumar, sought an exemption from appearance in court owing to his client’s social commitments. The court, however, said the plea would be considered later. Advocate Warisha Farasat, who appeared for Basharat Ali and the Gattoos, submitted that two of her clients had received offers to teach in universities abroad. She, therefore, sought to move an application before the court. The court pointed out that she’d have to move her plea before the sessions court, which was going to try the case. Judge Sharma had earlier taken cognisance of the chargesheet filed by Delhi Police against Kumar and nine others in the case and summoned all accused persons. The court had then taken cognisance of various offences, including sections 124 A (sedition), 147 (rioting) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. “The sanction to prosecute the aforementioned accused persons has already been filed by the home department, GNCT vide order dated February 27, 2020,” the court had said. “After careful perusal of the chargesheet and consideration of the material, all the accused persons mentioned herein above are summoned to face trial for the offence under section 124A/323/465/471/143/147/149/120B of IPC. Accused persons be summoned through an investigating officer for March 15. Copy of this order be also sent to all the parties through email/WhatsApp,” it had said.

CR chief PRO Shivaji Sutar said, “A new communication gateway has been opened in Neral-Matheran section of Mumbai division, with the inauguration of an optic fibre link between Neral and Jumapatti. In few months, the gateway will be extended till Matheran section.” The cost of laying of cables in phase I was more than Rs.4 crore. The cables can also serve for a Wi-fi facility and internet connection in the entire section. He said, “As mobile network availability is negligible in this section, provision of the cables and communication facilities over it will resolve long-pending communication requirements.” The toy train route also witnesses major and minor disasters. It will become quicker to seek and provide help once the communication network is reliable. RailTel will tie up with local services providers to ensure broadband connectivity with high speed for residents and commercial establishments. Matheran resident Santosh Jadhav said, “At present there is internet network provided by BSNL but the connection is erratic. Reliable network connectivity will help us in many ways, including online education and attract more tourists as work-from-home is going to become normal.” A hotelier said, “Internet connection has become as basic as water. We will ensure a good service provider ties up with railways to ensure a glitch-free network.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/matheran-to-get-broadband-soon-in-mumbai/articleshow/81517986.cms||Manthank Mehta

AMC’s health officer Neeta Padalkar said, “The existing capacity of 1,800 beds in state-run health institutions needs to be increased by 5,000 to deal with the second-wave of the pandemic. To achieve this, large function halls need to be transformed into Covid care facilities. As there is a ban on marriages and other such events, these halls are lying idle.” The civic administration has already announced that the existing quarantine centres would be also evolved into Covid care centres. In the meantime, Aurangabad divisional commissioner Sunil Kendrekar has also asked private hospitals to reserve beds for Covid patients as per laid down norms. “Though some major private hospitals were told to reserve beds as per the government policy, the managements of these hospitals have failed to ensure cent per cent availability of beds. Such half-hearted response will not be tolerated as there is huge surge in fresh Covid-19 cases daily,” he said.Kendrekar also said that hospitals failing to swing into action in the next three days would face stern action as per provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/amc-to-turn-function-halls-into-covid-care-facilities/articleshow/81518825.cms||---

The government land owned by the gram sabha is valued at about Rs 25 crore. The matter of land grab was brought to the notice of the district authorities by local MLA, Sanjeer Diwakar. District magistrate Vibha Chahal had ordered a probe into the matter. A probe committee comprising additional district magistrate (ADM), administration, sub divisional magistrate of Jalesar and land consolidation officer recently submitted its report. The committee found that the 7.69 hectares of land had been transferred in the name of five people in violation of norms. In its report, the committee said seven officials of the revenue department, including the then tehsildar Anand Singh, had allegedly registered the village land in the name of five individuals on the basis of fake documents. Chahal has sent a report to the state government, recommending strict action against the officials found to be involved in the malpractice. It was also recommended that Churthara village residents, Rakesh Kumar, Ram Bharoshi, Awadhesh Kumar, Habib Khan and Maina Devi, be declared land mafia. An FIR will soon be registered against them. Vivek Kumar Mishra, ADM, administration, who led the investigation, said, “An FIR will soon be registered. The government land was wrongly registered in the name of five people.

The city recorded 1,713 cases on Monday (1,962 on Sunday). Fewer detections may be attributed to fewer tests over the weekend due to manpower shortage, said a BMC official. Deaths in the 48-hour period fell from seven to four on Monday morning.At the state level, Nagpur circle added the highest cases (3,067) and fatalities (13) on Monday. Mumbai region added 3,047 cases and 8 deaths, taking the total to over 7.6 lakh and deaths to 19,968. Active cases in the state are on the rise and rate of recovery is dipping. There are now 1.3 lakh active, of which 13,309 are in Mumbai. In three days, the doubling rate for cases in the city fell from 186 days to 165 days on Monday. “The increasing numbers cannot be ignored even though daily deaths haven't risen in the last one month,'' said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani.“We have asked ward officers and medical officers to keep a closer watch on positive cases to ensure no one breaks home isolation rules,'' Kakani added. Tracking through the Arogya Setu app and CCTV cameras of housing colonies will be taken up. BMC conducted 16,697 tests on Sunday against 20,695 on Saturday; the weekday average is over 20,000 tests.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said another lockdown is not the answer to Covid resurgence. But monitoring will be stricter to ensure compliance with Covid protocols, he added. “Cases are on the rise, but case fatality rate is on the decline. Lockdown will be required in a situation where hospitals are overflowing, doctors are falling short and medicines are not available, that is not the situation at all today,” he added.Even in private hospitals while admissions have increased since last month, severe patients are fewer than in September 2020. “We still have vacant beds in ICUs. This wasn't the case last year,'' said an intensivist with a private hospital in Bandra.A week after Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation imposed curbs on shop timings, KDMC commissioner Dr Vijay Suryawanshi revised timings, allowing shops to open 10 am to 8 pm against the earlier 7 am to 7 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-new-cases-dip-over-the-weekend-nagpur-adds-the-highest-number/articleshow/81518862.cms||Bhavika Jain

Most owners, in the absence of a designated crematorium, are forced to bury their pets in open spaces. This, say experts, can prove to be a health hazard. Besides, it is also disturbing for owners to bury their pet in a random spot and not give them a fitting farewell. Dipti Rai, a resident of EC Road, said, “We have had dogs for several years in our family and the need for a cremation place in the city has been sorely felt. Most families have to bury their pets at secluded places and empty land plots which shouldn't be the case.” In a similar vein, Kamal Mushran, a resident of Jakhan, said, “Most pets die of age-related issues or some illness. Their systematic cremation will protect people from any kind of health hazard. The authorities must take appropriate steps in this direction.” When queried, Dr DC Tiwari, veterinary officer, Dehradun Municipal Corporation, said, “Pets are treated as family members by people and thus, they deserve to be cremated in a manner befitting a loved one. To this end, plans are being drawn up to create a designated place for cremating the animals. This will also prevent any risk of infection."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-absence-of-crematorium-for-pets-in-doon-owners-forced-to-bury-them-in-open-spaces/articleshow/81517748.cms||Abhijeet Singh

He said his father was very focused on the art, and cared little for the frills and fame that it had brought him. “His life was art, and there’s no confusion that he was absolutely dedicated to it. He was literally painting till the day before he passed away,” Akash said, adding that his love for art was the secret of his long life. “If he couldn’t paint anymore, he would not be able to live, it’s as simple as that. It is what kept him alive,” he said. Pai was an open-minded and unconventional father to Akash. “He never forced anything on me, be it art, his philosophies or his opinions. He always wanted me to figure out my own path,” said Akash, who pursued engineering and business management, and runs a healthcare startup in Silicon Valley. “He told me to do whatever I want and never interfered. He wanted me to think independently, and there was never any pressure to conform. He believed in the philosophical aspect of Hinduism but not the ritual aspect at all. He instilled independent thinking in me,” he said. “Being around him meant you met a lot of interesting people — chief ministers, governors, kings and other artists as well who are very interesting people — they dress different, look different and think different,” he said. Pai was also a talented musician who played several instruments including the sitar, tabla, mridangam and bansuri. “He could learn instruments like there was no tomorrow. He also dabbled in repairing electronic amplifiers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/his-life-was-art-it-is-what-kepthim-alive-son-on-laxman-pai/articleshow/81520420.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Mass vaccination is a way to reach herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Mahindra group chairman tweeted on Monday about how half the new daily cases are in Maharashtra, “the nerve centre of the country's economic activity” and more lockdowns would be "debilitating". Mahindra added that if “we don’t speed up the vaccination rate we will suffer second, third and fourth waves”. He further stressed that there is "no shortage of vaccines in the country". Over half the new daily cases are in Maharashtra.The state is the nerve-centre of the country’s economic activity &… https://t.co/JgPDbmBdjR— anand mahindra (@anandmahindra) 1615789371000Last week, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said he would seek permission from the Centre to open up vaccination in Pune for people aged over 18. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, a technical advisor to the state government, has called for a decentralised vaccination programme and criticized the need to distribute vaccines uniformly across states when the Covid march has been uneven.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vaccinate-all-in-maha-now-says-anand-mahindra/articleshow/81517992.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Foundation work for Ram Temple begins in Ayodhya||AYODHYA: The foundation work for the Ram Temple in Ayodhya began on Monday with the filling up of its foundation. The 13,000sq ft of foundation will be filled with multiple layers of cohesive material which will raise the foundation to 25ft above the ground. Before starting work on the temple’s foundation, a prayer was performed at Ram Janmabhoomi in the presence of Ram Mandir Trust secretary Champat Rai, trustee Dr Anil Mishra, Ayodhya DIG Deepak Kumar and district magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha. The temple will not stand on multiple pillars, but its base will be firmed up with 50 layers of cohesive material. Cement and iron may be excluded from the foundation-laying exercise as both can’t withstand the vagaries of nature for long, said experts who spent weeks brainstorming on the fresh blueprint. A 40-foot deep pit has been dug up to prepare the temple base. According to sources in the Trust, the concoction for each layer could include grinded stone, sand dust, micro silica and other chemicals. The first temple blueprint included 1,000 pillars spiralling from the foundation to an approximate height of a three-storied building to hold the grand temple. However, during test piling, the pillars failed to take a weight equivalent to that of the planned temple structure. This was attributed to a lack of strong earth stratum at the Ramjanmabhoomi site due to the presence of water underneath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/foundation-work-for-ram-temple-begins/articleshow/81520413.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

The officer found that the police stations, usually occupied with law and order situations and VIP bandobast, are the ones that have higher pendency rates. The officer decided to reward police station chiefs or promote them to keep track of the cases.Pingale told TOI: “It is the police’s duty to complete the probe and file chargesheets on time. However, I believe after doing the same work over a period of time, a person needs a fresh boost to continue delivering the results.”The officer said getting on-record cash reward is one of the most effective boosters in the police department, as it improves the personnel’s overall score in the annual confidential report. Though it is not a criterion, having more rewards gives a cop an edge in getting better postings.Authorities said the number of cases keep piling up and any delay in completion of probe and filing chargesheets add up to the pendency. In some instances, cases end up pending only because the investigation officer working on it was transferred and the new IO fails to connect all the dots. Making the police station chief accountable is expected to do away with this problem too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/police-station-chiefs-in-latur-to-get-rewarded-for-timely-chargesheet-filing/articleshow/81518840.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Nitesh alleges link between Waze, Aaditya’s cousin, seeks investigation||Mumbai: BJP MLA Nitesh Rane on Monday targeted Varun Sardesai, Aaditya Thackeray’s maternal cousin and secretary of Shiv Sena’s youth wing Yuva Sena. Rane demanded that the NIA probe the link between suspended API Sachin Waze and Sardesai. Sardesai said he will file a criminal defamation case against Rane. “During the recent Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches, Waze called up a few bookies to extort money and threatened to arrest or raid them. Later, Sardesai called Waze and asked for his share of the extorted money,” alleged Rane, who represents Kankavli constituency. “The NIA, along with Waze, should also probe Sardesai; they had connected through WhatsApp,” Rane claimed. “Is the chief minister protecting Waze only because of his link with Sardesai?” Rane claimed he has “certain call details” and will provide them to the investigating agencies. Refuting the allegations, Sardesai said: “Normally, I do not take his allegations seriously, but these baseless allegations could ruin my political career. So, I am filing a criminal defamation case against Nitesh Rane.” Pointing out that he is from a cultured and highly educated family, the Yuva Sena leader added: “Everyone knows about the Ranes. They are used to making allegations, but no one takes them seriously.” Anil Parab, Shiv Sena spokesperson and transport minister in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government said, “Rane should prove all the allegations and we are ready to face a probe by any investigating agency.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nitesh-alleges-link-between-waze-aadityas-cousin-seeks-investigation/articleshow/81520472.cms||---

But recovery has been steady after the lockdown started to be lifted in June last year and movement of people began albeit with restrictions. In fact, in the first two months of 2021, the deficit in visitors, compared to January and February in 2020, has shrunk further to 49% despite curbs on movement of foreign travellers. After April and May turned a dud with zero visitors, the state received 26,113 visitors in June. Rajasthan was the first in the country to open its state monuments for visitors from June 2. The numbers continued to rise steadily, reaching 13.59 lakh tourists in December 2020. In January and February this year, the inflow further strengthened as the state received 16.02 lakh and 18.55 lakh tourists, respectively. A senior tourist department official said the upward trend was expected to continue in the coming months though the lean summer season was likely to run its course. “Given the way the pandemic has disrupted life and businesses, the steady pace of growth in tourist inflow is reassuring. From the days of gloom, we have reached a stage where we expect to touch the pre-Covid days. The department is playing its part to revive the sector. We are participating in tourism marts happening in various cities and activating our source markets. Also, the restart of tourism fairs and festivals will contribute to the revival,” said Nishant Jain, director, department of tourism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/after-71-plunge-last-year-tourist-footfalls-pick-up-pace-again-in-raj/articleshow/81525025.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No need to stop blood-thinners for vaccine: Docs||Mumbai: For the last fortnight, cardiologists across the city have been inundated with messages and calls from elderly patients wanting clarity on the use of blood-thinners and Covid-19 vaccine. Even at vaccine centres, senior citizens express concern to their vaccinators and doctors about the “worrisome’’ link, but experts say there is no need to discontinue these drugs. “My advice is simple. Everyone should get vaccinated and both the vaccines are safe for heart patients,” said Dr Dev Pahlajani, head of interventional cardiology at Breach Candy Hospital. Blood thinners prevent clots from forming in the heart or blood vessels, thereby preventing a heart attack and stroke. The confusion was perhaps created during the clinical trial for Covaxin, that excluded heart patients on blood thinners. Dr Prafulla Kerkar, who heads the cardiology department of KEM Hospital, Parel, said there was no need for a debate any more on the need to take such an important medicine for patients. “Patients on blood thinners undergo tooth extraction, where there is relatively more blood loss than with an injection given with a fine needle,’’ Dr Kerkar added. There are two kinds of blood-thinners. “The widely prescribed ones are anti-platelets such as aspirin and clopidogrel that under no circumstances should be discontinued before or after vaccination,’’ said cardiologist Dr Ganesh Kumar from Hiranandani Hospital, Powai. The second type of blood-thinners are anticoagulants such as warfarin or newer oral drugs. “There is a possibility of patients on anticoagulants developing a hematoma (blood clot under the skin) if vaccinated with a thick bore needle,’’ said Dr Kerkar. Dr Pahlajani said the risk of developing hematoma is very minor. “If someone is very worried, they can stop their anticoagulant drugs for 24-48 hours prior to vaccination. They can start it soon after taking the vaccine,” Dr Pahlajani added. A doctor said those heading vaccine centres should reassure senior citizens on the safety of blood thinners with vaccination. “People have to be told that it is bigger problem with discontinuing than in continuing these medicines,’’ said Dr Kumar, adding that almost 30 million Indians have taken the vaccine, but cardiologists have not seen cases of excessive bleeding or embolism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-need-to-stop-blood-thinners-for-vaccine-docs/articleshow/81517996.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Frontline workers lag in taking jabs||LUCKNOW: Even as enthusiasm for Covid vaccination continued among elderly on Monday, data revealed that frontline workers are lagging in taking jabs. The drive was carried out at 122 centres on Monday – the highest number so far. Of these, 69 centres were run by the government and 53 by private hospitals. The vaccination course comprises two doses given at 28 days’ gap. TimesViewThis should alarm parents and teachers. A TOI reality check found gross violation of Covid-19 safety measures outside several schools. Forget about physical distancing, there was not even breathing space in school vans that were packed with kids with only a few wearing masks. Many children were found huddled in groups at school gates with little or no precautions. While schools had made no arrangement to ensure safety protocols, parents who had come to pick up their children, crowded the exit points, making things worse. As Covid-19 cases are rising again, we need to be extra careful. In fact, safety protocols should now be an integral part of daily school discipline. Both students and teachers need to contribute.In all, 12,259 took jabs, including 5,492 senior citizens aged 60 years or above and 1,108 people with comorbidity in 45-59 age group. These people took their first shots. As many as 3,785 healthcare workers also turned up - 933 for the first dose and 2,852 for the second. Similarly, the turnout of frontline workers was 1,874 - first dose 624 and second 1,250. Frontline workers include employees and officers of police, other security agencies, urban and rural local bodies and departmental of revenue among others. Health officers said that the phase II of the mass vaccination campaign (February 4-22) was dedicated for these workers. The phase ended in February, but left out frontline workers were given opportunity to get shots in the phase III meant for elderly and comorbid. However, a glance at vaccination records revealed that out of total 43,119 frontline workers in the district, only 70% (30,167) have taken the first dose so far. Further, among frontline workers who have taken one shot, about 8,879 were supposed to take their second by Monday.  However, only 7,186 (81%) have availed the opportunity till date. “As per norms, a beneficiary should get a second/booster dose on the 28th day of the first/primary dose, but there will be no effect on vaccine-elicited immunity, if a person takes the second dose within 42 days,” said district immunization officer Dr M K Singh. “The remaining rounds of Phase III will remain open for those who have missed their doses so far.,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/frontline-workers-lag-in-taking-jabs/articleshow/81520441.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

---||Goa||Two teachers in every school being trained to be health ambassadors||PANAJI: Two teachers from every aided, unaided and government school in the state are presently being trained, under a central government programme, to act as ‘health and wellness ambassadors’ in their respective schools. The trained teachers will conduct a one-hour activity-based session every week for students for 24 weeks in an academic year. The health and wellness ambassadors, during their sessions, will touch on 11 subjects covering various physical, mental and emotional aspects. The topics the teachers are being trained to tackle include safe use of internet, gadgets and media, healthy lifestyle, nutrition, sanitation, prevention of substance abuse, and reproductive health. Teachers are being trained to deliver the sessions through ‘culturally-sensitive’ activities. Emotional and mental well-being, interpersonal relationships, values and responsible citizenship, gender equality and HIV prevention will also be part of the programme, said Sindhu Prabhu Desai, co-ordinator-cum-state resource person for South Goa. The ‘School Health Programme’ has been taken up under Ayushman Bharat, jointly by the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) and ministry of education. In Goa, the training of teachers is being carried out under the state council for educational research and training (SCERT). Two teachers from each high school are undergoing three-day training. To be eligible for the certificate to be health and wellness ambassadors, the teachers have to answer an online test prior to the training and after the training. “Teachers have to compulsorily answer the online baseline assessment pre-test and post-test. Participating teachers are required to carry their smart phone/laptop with personal internet connection as they have to answer the tests,” SCERT director Nagaraj Honnekeri told schools in a circular. Education and health officials from the state trained by national resource persons are imparting the training to teachers. “After the training, teachers will implement the school health and wellness programe as health and wellness ambassadors in their respective schools to fulfill the objectives of the programme. Selected students in each class will be given the responsibility of spreading the message as health and wellness messengers,” schools have been told.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/two-teachers-in-every-school-being-trained-to-be-health-ambassadors/articleshow/81520444.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

HCS officer Manoj Khatri, estate office employee Rajinder Malhotra and an estate office clerk too have been summoned on the day. Police said the ASI was aware about the deal and threatened Sector 37 chemist Amit Gupta to stay away from the case. Due to the harassment, Amit Gupta shifted his shop to Panchkula.Besides, head constables Rampal and Bhupinder Singh recorded their statements before judicial magistrate. The SIT said Rajdeep Singh was not cooperating and trying to mislead the police investigation.

Vikas Rao, who spotted the bleeding youth asking for help, not only stopped the bus to help him but also jotted down a family member’s phone number and informed him so that the victim’s relatives could rush to his aid. Two men, reported to be the victim’s friends, have been arrested on the charge of attempt to murder. The victim, later identified as Ibrahim, is undergoing treatment at a city hospital and his condition is stable. Police later came to know that Ibrahim was stabbed by his friends during an argument, which was triggered by the victim’s decision to leave a job he was doing for a friend’s father. The driver told TOI that he and conductor Lokendra were out on Saturday night on their usual Narela-Rani Khera route in outer Delhi. “I belong to Jhunjhunu district in Rajasthan and moved to Delhi last December. I have been plying on the route at night,” Rao said. “At 11.47pm on Saturday, I left from Narela for Rani Khera bus depot. Usually only govt staffers or people who work till late board the bus at night. Around 12:30am, I reached near Bawana and saw a man with blood on him coming in front of the bus. I immediately stopped the bus and he told me he was stabbed in the throat.” Rao called Lokendra and they put him in the bus. “I don’t know exact locations of hospitals as I am new here; so Lokendra guided me. On the way, we found a police picket at Kanjhawala and informed the cops about the incident. One of them came with us,” the driver said. In the meantime, Rao also asked the victim for his family’s number and informed them. “By the time we reached hospital, his family and cops were already there. I left the hospital as a doctor started treating him,” said Rao. “I know that in Delhi not everyone stops to help, but my parents have taught me to help everyone in need. I couldn’t have left him bleeding on the road,” he added. Ibrahim was referred to Maharaja Agrasen Hospital from the first hospital in Kanjhawala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/alert-bus-driver-saves-man-stabbed-in-throat/articleshow/81520482.cms||Sakshi Chand

While I satisfy all the other criteria, there is one that stipulates that only a person who has completed 20 years in the Goa Civil Services is eligible to be appointed as the SEC. I do not fit into this criterion,” he told TOI. “I have informed the government accordingly and told them to decide appropriately,” Navti, who retired two years ago after a long tenure at the office of the chief electoral officer, said. A senior government officer said the appointment of Navti has been put on hold and they are exploring other names for appointment as the SEC. Sources said once a new SEC is appointed, the date for elections in the five municipalities will be decided. They said the government will have to go back to the drawing board again and start considering the names of retired IAS officers—Mihir Vardhan, Arun Desai and Daulat Hawaldar. Sources also said even recently elevated GCS officers to IAS cadre—Menino D’Souza, Narayan Sawant, Sanjit Rodrigues, Yatindra Maralkar, Sanjeev Gadkar, Prasad Lolayekar and Michael D’Souza—can be appointed as SEC, but they would have to resign from the service. The government’s search for a SEC started after law secretary Chokha Ram Garg, who was holding additional charge as the SEC, resigned from the poll body on Saturday after the Supreme Court chastised the state government and said a serving bureaucrat cannot be the SEC. On March 12, a Supreme Court bench of justices R F Nariman, B R Gavai and Hrishikesh Roy rapped the Goa government for giving additional charge of SEC to its law secretary, and said the decision “made a mockery of the constitutional mandate that state ECs must be truly independent bodies”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-fit-criteria-to-be-sec-navti-tells-ovt/articleshow/81520459.cms||Murari Shetye

The children, aged 3 to 14 years, were playing at Bhagwat chowk when the dog suddenly started biting them. Corporator Sharad More said two of the children suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the Bytco Hospital and were discharged on Monday. The corporator said the residents contacted and asked him to call the civic dog squad. “However, since the canine was aggressive and trying to attack at random, the residents started thrashing it.” By the time the dog squad reached the spot, the canine had succumbed to the injuries it had suffered due to the thrashing.

---||Mumbai||SC starts hearing to decide if 50% quota ceiling needs relook in Mumbai||New Delhi: A five-judge constitution bench of Supreme Court on Monday started day-to-day hearings to decide if its 1992 verdict fixing the ceiling of 50% on reservations had to be re-examined and also to decide validity of a Maharashtra law for granting Maratha reservations in breach of the ceiling. As per a timeline fixed by a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat, parties opposing Maratha reservations have been granted three days to argue, while the state government will argue for three days from March 18. The court will then hear arguments of the attorney general and other states, and wrap up the hearing on March 25. Initiating arguments, senior advocate Arvind P Datar opposed the plea for re-examination of 50% ceiling verdict and contended that Indra Sawhney judgement of nine-judge constitution bench stood the test of time and the apex court in its verdicts had followed it, and the judgement had never been questioned. Contending that 50% ceiling is like a Lakshman Rekha that cannot be crossed, Datar said, “From 1992, the ruling in Indra Sawhney, insofar as the 50% reservation is concerned, has never been doubted in any decision. It has been followed in several constitution bench decisions and several High Courts.” “The 50% limit is an essential part of right to equality, which is part of the basic structure. The division of 50% is not between backward classes and forward classes, but between affirmative action and open merit. Even members of SC/ST/OBC, who qualify on merit, continue to enjoy benefits of non-reserved merit quota. Significantly, the converse is not true; unfilled reserved seats can be carried forward even in excess of 50%. To change the 50% limit is to have a society not founded on equality, but based on caste rule,” Datar contended. Questioning Maharashtra government’s decision to grant reservations to Marathas, Datar said the community was declared a forward community by Mandal Commission and National Commission for Backward Classes in 2000, and rejected a plea to bring the community within reserved category. “It is impossible to believe the Maratha caste/community, found to be a socially advanced and prestigious caste/community in February 2000, can become backward in 2018. The burden of proof is on the state of Maharashtra to show that when India has progressed economically and socially over the last 20 years, the Maratha community has alone slipped into reverse gear and became socially and economically backward,” he said. The main plank of the bunch of petitioners challenging validity of the Maratha quota is that it took total reservations in the state beyond the 50% ceiling on quota put by SC in its Indra Sawhney judgment in November 1992, while upholding validity of 27% OBC quota in government jobs, which was later extended to admissions in state-run educational institutions. The state government had framed the law on November 30, 2018, granting 16% quota for Marathas in government jobs and admission in educational institutions. While upholding the law, Bombay HC had directed the government to bring it down to 12% for education and 13% for jobs, as recommended by a state-appointed backward class commission headed by former HC judge M B Gaikwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sc-starts-hearing-to-decide-if-50-quota-ceiling-needs-relook-in-mumbai/articleshow/81517997.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP: BJP MP Kaushal Kishore’s bahu slits her wrist after posting two videos||LUCKNOW: Hours after BJP MP Kaushal Kishore’s son Ayush recorded his statement before Madiaon police against his wife Ankita, she slashed her wrist after posting two videos on social media on late Sunday night. In the five-minute video, Ankita claimed she is not at fault and is going to end her life. In a dramatic twist to the ongoing tussle, Ankita reached the house of BJP MP Kaushal Kishore late night on Sunday and created a scene on being denied entry. She then uploaded two videos announcing she is going to end her life. A police team reached the spot and took Ankita to Mahila police station and let her off only when she promised not to create any further trouble, but she returned to the MP’s residence and slit her wrists and was rushed and admitted to Civil hospital by police. ADCP North, Prachi Singh said Ankita is out of danger and Kakori police have been informed. Talking to reporters at the hospital, Ankita said she tried to contact Ayush many times but failed and even his brother refused to recognize her. “I was left with no option but to end my life,” she said. Responding to the allegations, BJP MP said Ankita is trying to tarnish the image of his family, including his wife who is an MLA. “It seems she is playing in the hands of some people who are against me. She threatened to commit suicide and then slashed her wrists which is a crime and police should take action,” the MP said. “They married against our wishes and without our consent. We have no role in this and the police are already probing the case. She is lying in the videos she has posted on social media. She is giving statements against Ayush. I have full faith in the law of the land,” he said. In her videos, Ankita had accused Ayush of spoiling her life and threatened to end her life saying she doesn’t want to live anymore. “Ayush you used to say your parents don’t love you, but now you have left me. I am all alone what will happen to me, nothing is left in my life now. Your father is an MP. Who will hear my complaint? I cannot fight, I am not left with anything to live further,” she said. Earlier, Ayush had been shot at on March 2 and was hit in his left ribs. He had claimed that three unidentified miscreants had opened fire at him. Later, police claimed that Ayush had staged the attack on himself in connivance with Ankita’s brother Adarsh Singh. Police arrested Adarsh and recovered a pistol from him. Ayush slipped away from KGMU where he was admitted and uploaded a video blaming Ankita and alleged she gave him sedatives.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai University has earned crores as revaluation fees||MUMBAI: Revaluation seems to hold tremendous value for not just students, but also the university. Information received from Mumbai University through RTI shows that it has raked in crores in lieu of revaluation charges and photocopying fees. Till November 2019-20, MU had received Rs 2.8 crore from aggrieved students of the past semester. In 2018-19, the sum was Rs 3.7 crore, higher than the previous year. With take-from-home online MCQ (multiple choice questions) exams, revaluation revenue would be zero for the exams conducted in the second half of 2020. “There will be no revenue for this year as the exams are all MCQ format,” said exam controller Vinod Patil. “Students taking university exams are losing faith in its assessment,” said RTI activist Vihar Durve. The situation is more confounding for students who don’t receive revaluation results in time and are thus forced to appear for supplementary exams. In several cases, results of revaluation are declared after students appear for supplementary exams. “Candidates must trust results are declared after a strict process,” said a university officer. In 2019, of the 88,889 candidates who applied for revaluation, 24,221 or 1 in 4 cleared the exam. In 2018, of 87,567 candidates who applied for revaluation, 39,652 were wrongly failed, the response to an RTI application has revealed. These students cleared the bar after revaluation. In 2017, too, as many as 35,000 students—or close to 36% of the over 97,000 who applied for revaluation of more than 1.8 lakh answer papers—had been wrongly marked as failed. Durve found in 2018, 1.5 lakh candidates of the approximately 3.5 lakh applied for revaluation, raising questions on the quality of evaluation. Revaluation charge per paper is Rs 250 and photocopying Rs 50 a paper. “The university has to improve its assessment and needs to appoint eligible teachers only to carry out the assessment. Moreover, there is a long-standing demand to refund the money of students who clear after revaluation,” said senate member Vaibhav Narawde. Answer scripts for revaluation from the commerce stream totalled 33,152. Engineering saw 29,614. University officials said the problem is pronounced for BMS and BMM too, most of which are offered at private institutes, which lack full-time faculty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-university-has-earned-crores-as-revaluation-fees/articleshow/81518933.cms||---
---||Agra||UP: Depressed over slapping younger brother, 10-year-old girl hangs self||AGRA: A 10-year-old girl who was apparently depressed and scared of being beaten up by her elder sister for slapping her seven-year-old brother, allegedly killed herself by hanging from the ceiling in Agra’s Pratapura village on Saturday evening. According to police, the little girl lived with her elder sister and two younger siblings — two-year-old sister and her only brother. On the fateful day, the girl called her brother several times for some work, but he did not listen to her and was busy playing with his friends. She got angry with his behaviour and slapped him twice. Reacting to it, the brother had threatened to take it up with his eldest sister who would "punish her". Without saying a word, the girl then went into her room and locked the door. Her brother continued playing with other kids. After sometime, one of the kids told the boy that his sister had closed the door from inside. The boy then tried to open the door latch by putting his fingers through the door. After finally opening it, he was shocked to find his sister hanging from the ceiling and immediately informed a neighbour. His elderly grandfather, who stays with them, was not in position to move from his cot. According to officials, the children’s father did not stay with them and their mother had passed away around two years ago. The eldest girl works in some shop in Fatehabad. The young girl apparently felt guilty and killed herself. However, police are probing all angles including murder and sexual assault. Fatehabad station house officer Pradeep Kumar told TOI on Monday that preliminary investigation had revealed the same narration. He said, the boy and other children who were playing with him also told them the same. The postmortem report revealed hanging and no injury marks were found on the girl’s body, he added. When contacted, former chairperson of psychology department of AMU, prof Naima Khatoon, said that this lone incident can’t lead to suicide. She said, there must be some other reason and this particular incident may have acted as a trigger. "It's a broken family as their mother died and father doesn’t stay with them. In such cases, children’s psyche is different from normal kids and their behaviour becomes maladaptive [that stop you from adapting to new or difficult circumstances]," the professor added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/depressed-over-slapping-younger-brother-10-year-old-girl-hangs-self/articleshow/81516830.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Chandigarh||PGI does chain swapping of kidneys for 3 transplants||CHANDIGARH: Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) of a 50-year-old woman from Uttarakhand who needed a kidney were incompatible with her 45-year-old husband. The woman was B positive and her husband a universal donor O positive. But due to HLA mismatch, there were chances of organ rejection. Located over 500kms was a 31-year-old B positive woman looking for a kidney match for her 29-year-old A positive brother. And still far located in Srinagar was a pair of 49-year-old A positive mother and her 32-year-old O positive son looking for a compatible donor. Due to non-matching of blood groups, they could not donate their kidneys to their loved ones. Using permutation and combination of this group, a chain swapping of kidneys was done for the first time in north India at PGIMER. This allowed all the three to get kidneys from the right match in the available pool. “We had been routinely doing conventional swap amongst couples. In PGI we have done 30 such conventional swaps over the past three years. This idea of chain swap had been in our minds for a while and it has finally taken shape,” said Prof HS Kohli, head of the PGI’s nephrology department. Prior to such mismatch, the doctors had been providing medical treatment for ABO incompatible kidneys. This required removing antibodies from your blood. “It needs time and medicines. We have seven such chains as well, which we plan to do next time,” said Prof Kohli. The doctors explained that in 10-15% cases, there are donors who are medically fit, but either the blood group is not compatible or there is an antibodies’ mismatch. “This chain swap increases the minted pool of compatible donors. All the donors and recipients are wheeled in the OT at the same time. This is the first such chain in north India. It is mainly done in Ahmedabad at the institute of kidney diseases. We realised that this is the best option,” said Prof Kohli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-does-chain-swapping-of-kidneys-for-three-transplants/articleshow/81518942.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: SC defers hearing on Navlakha plea for default bail||New Delhi: Supreme Court deferred hearing by a week on social activist Gautam Navlakha’s plea seeking default bail as NIA failed to file its chargesheet within the prescribed 90 days. A bench of Justices U U Lalit and K M Joseph, which had on March 3 issued a notice to NIA, adjourned the hearing after it sought time to file a counter-affidavit. The bench posted the case for March 22. Navlakha approached SC after Bombay HC rejected his plea for bail in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case. He contended that default bail be granted to him as NIA failed to file its chargesheet within 90 days. He contended that the period for which he was confined under house arrest should be calculated as part of judicial custody and should be taken into account while deciding custody period. But NIA contended before HC that the 34 days of house arrest (August 29-October 1, 2018) was termed ‘illegal’ by Delhi HC, so it cannot be included in period of detention. SC will decide if the period of house arrest be counted while calculating period of custody before the chargesheet was filed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sc-defers-hearing-on-navlakha-plea-for-default-bail/articleshow/81517998.cms||---

They were administered Covishield, said civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur. They include two doctors and one staff nurse posted at the general hospital in Phase VI and one field staff member from Lalru civil hospital. “They all are women workers and have been home quarantined,” she said. She asserted, “There are possibilities of getting infection even after getting vaccinated. These workers have mild symptoms but as a precautionary measure they have been home quarantined and their health is being regularly monitored. They were administered the first dose in January and the second in February-end.” On the other hand, the beneficiaries are questioning the effectiveness of the vaccine. They said if even after the second dose one can get infection, then what was the use of the vaccination. Balbir Singh, a senior citizen who recently got the first dose, said, “It is strange to know that people are contracting the virus even after the second dose. How can we have confidence in the vaccine if we are not safe even after getting it?” Reports of health workers contracting the virus after getting the second dose are being received from the other parts of the country as well. The Covid vaccine was launched on January 16 and the first group to receive it included healthcare and frontline workers. The second group to become eligible for vaccination from March 1 was of senior citizens and persons above 45 years with comorbidities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/health-frontline-workers-ve-after-getting-2nd-vaccine-dose/articleshow/81518945.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

---||Mumbai||Some Maharashtra staff will have staggered shifts||MUMBAI: Considering the surge in Covid-19 cases here, most departments at the state secretariat have chosen alternate day office attendance for 50% staff as an option, while water conservation department has asked told staff to work in two staggered shifts to avoid crowding. Rural development, tribal development, social justice, water supply, labour, energy, school education and law & judiciary departments started alternate day work from Monday. Many other departments are yet to decide an option. Water conservation department told its officials to work in two shifts from 8am to 4pm and noon to 8pm. The department will thus have full strength in office from noon to 4pm. An official said that instead of staggered timing, alternate days was a better option. On Sunday, Covid cases in the state spiked above 16,000 after five months, while Mumbai recorded over 1,900 cases. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had told the state administration to stagger timing. Departments, which told half their staff to attend office on alternate days, have issued orders with names, designation of staff and dates on which s/he will attend office and work from home the other days. Like other departments, A N Wasave joint secretary of law & judiciary department, issued guidelines for staff and said that when employees are on ‘work-from-home’ duty, they have to be alert and keep their mobile phones on, and be in touch with office via email from 9.45am to 6.15pm (office hours) or they will be marked absent. In case of requirement, an employee must be in office within two hours, said an order. A senior official from disaster management cell said all departments must have issued separate internal orders and there was no uniformity in implementation of staggered timing. Staggered office timings has been on the government mind for sometime to reduce crowding in local trains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-maha-depts-stagger-shifts-work-on-alternate-days/articleshow/81517999.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

Officials said despite testing positive on March 11, she had stepped out for a film shoot. According to the complaint, when officials reached Khan’s home at Oshiwara, Andheri, on Sunday, she refused to open the door and allowed herself to get hand-stamped only after several requests. “We received a complaint that she was moving around, risking her life and that of others too. When our staff reached her home on Sunday night, her husband initially said she was in a flat in the adjacent wing. We decided to take police help following which Khan allowed us to stamp her. We have now asked her to move into institutional quarantine at the PWD guest house, while her high-risk contacts have been asked to quarantine themselves too,” assistant municipal commissioner Vishwas Mote said. Khan’s father passed away earlier this month. Officials did not confirm if he was infected as well. They said Khan had two reports—a positive report dated March 11 from Mumbai, and a Delhi report of March 12 showing she was negative. “Even if one report is positive, quarantine is mandatory,” said Mote. Police spokesperson DCP S Chaitanya said a case has been registered against the actor under various sections of the IPC as well as under the NDMA Act and Epidemic Diseases Act.

The administration has asked for a fresh report as some of the departments had failed to adhere to a similar directive in January. As the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) are keeping an eye on the disposal of plastic items and waste, the Chandigarh administration had notified plastic ban in the city in 2019. Recently, the Union government had sought from the UT a report on the ban enforcement.On the demand of manufacturers last year, the UT had removed three items from the list of banned plastic items. The administration had kept plastic refill pouch having quantity less than 500ml, straws attached with tetra packs and multilayered packaging used for food / snacks packing under extended producer responsibility (EPR) instead of the ban list.The UT in September 2019 had banned plastic plates, cups, party bloopers, plastic ribbons and many other single-use plastic in the city.In July 2019, the UT had issued the draft notification and sought suggestions and objections from public within 60 days. Its committee had received around 32 objections, including those from resident welfare associations, traders and industrialist organisations. The administration had taken the step after the NGT directed it to submit its action plan on systematic disposal of plastic waste. The NGT had ordered that any person found using, storing, purchasing, dealing with or distributing plastic bags, plastic plates or plastic glasses and such allied items shall be liable to pay environmental compensation at the rate of Rs 5,000 per event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-seeks-report-from-depts-on-plastic-ban-enforcement/articleshow/81518976.cms||---

She had quarantined herself after her husband was confirmed to have contracted the virus about five days ago. The health department officials said they were tracing her contacts and their samples would be taken on Tuesday. “A month ago, the ADC (development) had received the first dose against Covid-19. She was to get the second dose within a week or two. She is asymptomatic. It is not certain that a person who gets vaccinated will not contract Covid. Wearing of mask and maintaining social distancing is a must,” said civil surgeon Dr Satinder Singh. The health department authorities said 106 patients tested positive on Monday, taking the district case count to 18,701. As many as 16,967 have recovered. There are 1,195 active cases. On the day, around 1,553 persons were vaccinated of which 867 were senior citizens. 15 more students of Thapar institute catch virus Meanwhile, 15 more students of Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala, tested positive on Monday.

Two days ago, 16 students were found positive in the college hostel following which two hostel blocks were declared containment zones. On Monday, three more hostel blocks were declared as containment zones as well as some residential areas near them.  The institute’s registrar, Gurbinder Singh, said, “Students who are not quarantined can be permitted to move back home only after the permission of the health officials. There are around 2,500 students in the hostels and the examinations were supposed to be held next month. The decision over the postponement of examinations may be taken if the Covid situation does not improve. The exams might be postponed till June.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/adc-tests-positive-a-month-after-getting-jabbed/articleshow/81518950.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh is scripting a new saga of economic transformation||Covid-19 has been mostly about stories of gloom. Economies all across the world have been on shambles and growth rates compromised. Even the mightiest of them are all struggling to remain afloat. The state finances around the world are under three-pronged pressure. First, there is increased expenditure on health to meet the new challenge. Secondly, there are booster or bailout packages to keep the private sector afloat. And thirdly, with compromised economies, the tax collection has gone for a hit. In other words, while expenditure is rising, receipts are falling to the floor. Given the global scenario of negative growth where India itself suffered a negative growth of nearly 25% for a while, a fall in tax collection in the state was only expected. However, Uttar Pradesh is scripting an extraordinary story. Unlike most parts of the world, the state shows exceptional tax buoyancy in these difficult times. Almost all taxes show high buoyancy which may be reflective of the extraordinary resilience that the state demonstrates. Consumer State Advantage is UP’s USP and this may have played to UP’s advantage. However, the taxes where the state had complete control show phenomenal buoyancy. Hence the effort that goes to make this possible cannot go unnoticed. In this year’s budget, despite challenges, UP has put its money/ investment on infrastructure like roads, expressways, Airports, metros and much more. Past evidence bears testimony to the fact that the budget does have the potential to spur growth. The transition in growth from around 4% growth in 1990s to over 6% growth in the early years of this century was facilitated in great measure by increased capital expenditure. The rise in capital expenditure to over Rs 1,13,000 crore from the current level of around Rs 68,000 crore is likely to enhance the state’s capacity to anchor growth. Fiscal consolidation along with other interventions seem to be making a difference. It is no surprise that the state emerges as the second largest economy among the states in terms of the size of the GSDP. The state’s per capita income has increased, exports have gone up and major multinational electronic firms have agreed to invest in the state. Government policies are making a difference aimed at enhancing ease of doing business. Consequently, the state also emerges as the second best in terms of ease of doing business (EODB). Many electronic textile and manufacturing units are likely to come up in the state in the near future. On many of the fronts UP is catching up with the developed states like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu and others. The state government took many policy decisions to bring diverse industries to the state in order to create job opportunities for the youth and boost the GDP. This facilitated unveiling of 250 units projects worth 65,000 crore in July, 2019. Of these, seven units have already become operational at the cost of more than Rs 8,500 crore. The total investment during the past four years of the Yogi government is estimated at more than Rs 88,000 crore. The outcomes of the developments taking place in the electronic, manufacturing and renewable energy sectors in the state will become visible in coming years. In the manufacturing sector alone, ten companies have invested Rs 32,000 crore in the state. The World Trade Centre has invested Rs 10,000 crore, Vivo Mobiles Rs 750,000 crore, Oppo Mobiles 2,000 crore, Holitech India 7,500 crore, Sunwoda Electronic India Pvt Ltd Rs 1500 crore, KHY Electronics India 350 crore and Lianchuang (LCE) about 300 crore and the companies have already started operations in Gautam Buddha Nagar. In the renewable energy sector, 18 companies have invested Rs 16,000 crore. Furthermore, in Mirzapur district, M Plus Energy Solutions has invested Rs 250 crore and has started operations. Two telecom companies, Reliance JIO Infocomm Limited and the BSNL have also invested Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 5,000 crore respectively and have started operations. Sparsh Industries Private Limited has invested Rs 600 crore whereas Rimjhim Ispat has invested 550 crore in Kanpur (rural). Kent RO Systems Ltd has invested Rs 300 crore in Gautam Buddha Nagar and PTC Industries Ltd. has invested Rs 200 crore in Lucknow. MM Forgings Private Limited has invested 150 crore in Barabanki. The proposed defence corridor is another opportunity which the state government seems to have seized with both hands. State invited big global producers to the Lucknow Defense Expo to facilitate investments, an interesting start in terms of investment of Rs 4,500 crore is already materialising. It’s not just about investment, instead it’s about a government’s intent and capacity to convince the investors about the states facilitating capacity. The Yogi Government's 'One District One Product Scheme' (ODOP) has proved to be a great facilitator particularly during Covid times in terms of providing employment to workers in the state. The government is taking active interest in people engaged in ODOP. As a result, there is increased interest in ODOP among E-commerce companies as well. Today, millions of people have got employment through ODOP. According to the data of the MSME department, 8.67 lakh new units were started in the state in the last eight months, which were given loans to the tune of Rs 30,840 crores by banks. Over 1.5 crore employment opportunities were created by banks by providing loans totalling more than Rs 2,12,000 crore. It seems that the state has brought itself in a position to anchor development in the state. Many of the interventions seem to be falling in place and are certainly working for the state. With the level of fiscal consolidation and improved economic environment, the state needs to take a lead in initiating second generation reforms anchored around rural development (including MSME) and Human development (primarily health and education). This has the potential for taking the state to the next level of development.

Figures shared by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation suggested that intensive drives by the train company’s flying squads to penalise those flouting Covid norms had resulted in increasing compliance and decreasing infractions like not wearing face masks, sitting on seats meant to be vacant or not maintaining social distancing at stations and inside trains. As there are no provisions in the Delhi Metro’s Operation and Maintenance Act for prosecuting those not wearing face masks or violating social distancing, DMRC imposes a penalty of Rs 200 for ‘nuisance on Metro premises’. After being shut down for 169 days last year due to the pandemic, Delhi Metro resumed its services from September 7, 2020. Despite taking measures to create awareness about Covid-appropriate behaviour, many passengers were either removing their masks once on the station premises or inside the trains. From September 11, DMRC deployed its flying squads and by the time the month came to an end, its teams had penalised 5,180 passengers. In October, the number of passengers fined went up to 5,645. However, even as Delhi was seeing its worst wave of Covid cases, DMRC’s flying squads detected only 3,174 violators in November and an even fewer 2,257 in December. In January, 3,131 passengers were hauled up, before the number dipped to 2,805 in February. This month, approximately 1,000 passengers were punished in the first week. Without giving out numbers, a DMRC official said the number of flying squads had increased since September last year as had the intensity of the drive. He felt passengers had now got used to the Covid precautions, with the frequent drives and the presence of the flying squads also acting as deterrents. The squads are led by a senior DMRC official authorised to penalise passengers. There is at least one official carrying a point-of-sale machine to enable fine payment through debit or credit cards. The teams are also often accompanied by Central Industrial Security Force personnel. The flying squads, after deployment on September 11, had penalised 2,214 passengers by September 20. This is apart from the 5,000 passengers ‘counselled’ for not wearing face masks properly or for not being careful enough about social distancing. Initially, DMRC had deployed around 1,000 officials across the rail network to assist and guide passengers in the wake of the new norms for metro travel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-metro-pulled-the-chain-on-covid-violations/articleshow/81519059.cms||Sidharatha Roy

This is around 2.79% wastage too date, which is less than the permissible limit of 10%. However, public health experts say in the developed countries, when any wastage is expected, the offer is immediately thrown open to all to get the shots. The same should have been followed here, they add. To date, 47,454 beneficiaries have been vaccinated. Sources say the states and UTs where Covaxin is being offered see more wastage as there are 20 doses in a vial. “Once opened, 20 or more beneficiaries must be present, else the vials have to be thrown. However, in Covishield, there are only 10 doses in a vial, so wastage is less,” they add. In the US, there is a database of people who are interested in the vaccine and are outside the priority pool. “They are immediately contacted and asked to come within 15 minutes to avoid wastage. My nephew got his jab this way,” says a PGI doctor. He says, “The same can be followed in our country, where we can have a database of professionals. Besides, the demand for the vaccine has been increasing in the city and residents are eagerly awaiting their turns.” There were reports that in Panchkula and Mohali private hospitals, some were getting forged certificates of co-morbidities from the registered medical practitioners. The UT health department is checking the malpractice in Chandigarh. “We have been conducting checks for any malpractice and have not come across any such case here,” says Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, UT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/over-1200-vials-of-vaccines-go-waste/articleshow/81518987.cms||Shimona Kanwar

According to the FIR filed with Navrangpura police on Monday, a 41-year-old realty developer, Kaushal Patel, alleged that Ravi Sharma — who is on the run in the Thaltej case — along with Rahul Gaud, Nitin Gaud, Brijmohan Gaud, Ashish Vishwakarma and their accomplice Sanjay Vishwakarma attempted dacoity at Patel’s home in Suvas Colony, Navrangpura. Patel stated in his FIR that he had in October 2020 given a contract for making furniture at his home to a man named Raju Mistry. Mistry had brought Ashish and Sanjay Vishwakarma as his workers. As Mistry could not complete the work in the given time, Patel handed over the work to another carpenter. On February 12, 2020, at about midnight, Patel’s domestic help called him up and said that someone had locked him inside his room and he suspected that some burglars might have entered the house. Patel then locked the door leading to his room. Patel said he also heard voices of the burglars and called up his neighbour, Niraj Lamba, seeking help. But by the time Lamba reached his house, the burglars had fled. Later he checked CCTV footage of his society and found that six persons had entered his house but as they could not rob anything, they fled on two motorcycles, Patel stated in the FIR. When Patel saw footage of the Thaltej killing accused, he saw that they may have been the same persons who tried to conduct rob his house. The accused also confessed to Sola police that they were involved in the attempted dacoity at Patel’s house. Sharma, Rahul, Nitin, Brijmohan and Ashish were accused in the killing of Ashok and Jyotsna Patel, both 58, at the couple’s home at Shantivan Palace Bungalows near Hebatpur Crossroads in Thaltej.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/killers-tried-robbing-navrangpura-family/articleshow/81519025.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Diesel sales dip 15%, petrol unchanged in Mumbai||Mumbai: High fuel prices have now hit diesel sales, which have plummeted at least 15% at the pumps in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, according to Petrol Dealers’ Association. Association secretary Chetan Modi said, “There is a significant drop in the number of trucks, trailers, tempos, tourist buses, Ola and Uber cabs, and dumper trucks arriving at over 200 pumps in the region. They would come in large numbers to fill diesel but now the numbers have fallen.” Sources in the association said the average sales of diesel per pump every month were around 200 kilolitres, which, of late, have come down to 165-170 kilolitres. The reason: Several tourist buses are not plying due to Covid restrictions or drop in passengers, many goods transporter firms are hit, there is a drop in the number of truck arrivals, and a lot of Ola and Uber cabs have switched to CNG. “We are witnessing vehicles converted from diesel to CNG, especially aggregator cabs and a few private cars,” said a pump owner from Ghatkopar. Ravi Shinde, former president of the association, said the business of several transport companies in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai was impacted during the Covid pandemic. On the other hand, petrol sales are not hit and, on an average, 300 kilolitres of the fuel is being sold at most pumps every month—considered profitable, sources said. The price of petrol and diesel, though, has not gone up by a single paise for over a fortnight after a series of hikes earlier this year. The last hike of petrol was on February 27 to Rs 97.57 per litre and diesel Rs 88.60. Mahendra Arya, president, All India Transporters Welfare Association, said, “There are over 11,000 operators in the state who have incurred losses to the tune of crores. These are bad times for the transport sector, where we have demanded rollback on taxes, VAT on diesel, withdrawal of toll and revising the e-way bill system.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/diesel-sales-dip-15-petrol-unchanged-in-mumbai/articleshow/81518988.cms||Somit Sen
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Two doctors who got first shot infected||CHANDIGARH: Two resident doctors from the department of orthopaedics in GMCH-32 and two patients in the orthopaedic ward tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. Sources said, “Now, all the patients in the ward will be tested for the infection. There are around 26 patients in the ward who are admitted with bone trauma or injury. These doctors were given the first dose of vaccine against Covid and were due to get the second shot.” “We are not admitting more patients in this ward as it has to be isolated. All the patients before admission are tested. However, they have their attendants coming daily. This cannot be restricted. But we have instructed all to wear mask and adhere to social distancing,” said Dr Sudhir Garg, head of the orthopaedics department. Last week, nine doctors, five from ENT and four from anaesthesia, had tested positive in GMCH-32. Following this, the physical OPDs, which were resumed, were shut. “As the cases are rising, people are turning casual. We do not allow the attendants to enter the ward without mask, but they can’t be monitored round the clock,” Dr Garg added. The department shall be conducting Covid tests on more doctors and health workers posted in the ward. “These doctors were symptomatic and that is why we asked them to get tested,” said Dr Garg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/2-docs-2-patients-of-sec-32-hosp-catch-infection/articleshow/81518994.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Kolhapur||MSEDCL staff face heat for disconnecting power supply||Kolhapur: An MSEDCL employee was assaulted when he went to cut the power supply of consumers, who have not cleared their power dues in the past year, at Bamani on Sunday. An FIR has been lodged against two people by Suresh Dutta Chavan, a technician with the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), at Kagal police station for the attack. Officials from the state power utility said this was the fourth incident in the last five days since the drive to snap power connections of defaulters was started.Officials said over 2.9 lakh consumers have paid power bills amounting to Rs 41.85 crore in the last two weeks. Maximum domestic consumers — around 67,000 — from Kolhapur city cleared dues to the tune of Rs 9.42 crore for fear of disconnection. On Monday,the power supply of only five domestic consumers were disconnected, besides 53 commercial and eight industrial connections.Activists, along with a large number of people, protested outside the MSEDCL office in Kolhapur city and appealed to citizens not to pay the power bills. They were seeking appointment with the MSEDCL officials but were refused citing law and order concerns.Nivas Salokhe, convenor of the activists forum, said, “Waiving the power bills for the lockdown period will not cause any major losses to the state government. Now, most consumers do not have money to pay the bills. Moreover, the bills issued during the lockdown were inflated. We demand both correction of the bills and waiving of the power dues billed for the lockdown period.”MSEDCL officials have stated if a consumer gives a written application that he or she is unable to pay the dues in one go, he or she can pay the dues in installments. Officials said many consumers have opted for this route. “For irrigation connections, waiver of up to 50% is available while for domestic connections, the government has allowed payment in installments if part of the due amount is paid first,” said Prabhakar Nirmale, executive engineer, MSEDCL.Representatives of a consumer forum met the MSEDCL officials on Monday. They appealed to consumers to opt for paying the dues in instalments and reiterated that the MSEDCL would collapse if the bills were not paid as it did have no sufficient funds to run the power supply systems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/msedcl-staff-face-heat-for-disconnecting-power-supply/articleshow/81518982.cms||---

The recorded conversations and circumstantial evidence have formed the basis for Bohra’s judicial custody till March 26 by a lower court on Monday. The conversations show that Bohra had been consistently demanding sexual favours on the pretext of getting the main accused arrested. Sources in ACB said that since Bohra had arrested the main accused’s sister, he had become vocal in his demands. “What will I get in lieu of arresting the accused sister? Don’t I work hard on your case? What is my reward for helping you in this case? Here are some questions the accused asked the victim in one of the recorded conversations. The victim can be heard asking him to disclose the kind of reward repeatedly. In the later part of the conversation the accused asked her to have physical relationship with him,” said an ACB source. The ACB officials meticulously planned to trap the accused since the matter is beyond cash transfer. The actual operation started on March 6. “Thereafter whenever the victim visited the accused, she carried a recorder provided by the ACB to build up evidence against him,” said ACB source. The official said that Bohra had been taking Rs 10,000 from the rape survivor every month since October. The ACB also has evidence of him taking bribe for carrying out investigation. The call recordings will be sent for forensic analysis and soon the Bohra’s voice sample will be collected to match his voice. Bohra was posted as ACP in Women Atrocities Research Unit in Jaipur (East).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bohra-in-judicial-custody-till-march-26/articleshow/81518985.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Villagers pool money to rebuild Gauri Kund destroyed in 2013 flood||DEHRADUN: After repeated requests to the administration and politicians to rebuild and give a facelift to Gauri Kund hot water spring -- which got damaged in the 2013 Kedarnath deluge -- fell on deaf years, locals have now taken the task of reconstructing the holy spring upon themselves. Villagers have pooled in money and have started clearing the debris and muck from the hot spring area. They are also planning to construct changing rooms and provide other amenities to pilgrims. The Gauri Kund hot water spring is considered one of the holiest sites on the Char Dham route. It is located around 18 km away from the Kedarnath temple. Gauri Kund is idyllically situated on the banks of the Mandakini river. It also serves as the base camp for trek to the Kedarnath temple. Gauri Kund lies at an altitude of nearly 6,000m, and pilgrims stop here to take a holy dip. The place holds great significance in the hearts of villagers as they call it a ‘heritage site’. “We know that the 11-floor Bengali’s Bharat Seva Ashram got washed away in the 2013 deluge here. The need of the hour is to immediately protect this site. Gauri Kund has ample of mythological as well as scientific value,” said Dirghayu Goswami, a villager who was a witness to the Kedarnath deluge. These days he spends several hours a day to clear the pond of debris and muck, and beautify it. Goswani tells TOI why the villagers consider the place so important to them: “I am 47 years old now and every year we had seen Char Dham pilgrims first taking holy dip at Gauri Kund and then starting their onward journey to the Kedarnath temple. The area is not just mythologically significant, but also a heritage site. The administration needs to understand that scientifically, too, the area holds huge significance in terms of the hot water spring in such a cold landscape.” According to village pradhan Soni Devi, after the destruction, women devotees faced hurdles in taking a dip and also while changing clothes. “We had approached the administration and local politicians, including chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat when he was an MP, several times for the construction of the kund, but every time we were told that there was no fund. Fed up with such neglect, the villagers then decided to pool in money and started the construction. We had waited for too long and now that the Char Dham Yatra is nearing, we took up the task of construction on ourselves,” said Soni Devi. Soni said, “I have personally seen women facing challenges while changing clothes after taking a dip in the pond because there is no such provision now. There are two hot water ponds -- one for men and the other for women. Earlier, there was a changing room for women but now women are forced to change in the open. This has to stop.” Rudraprayag district disaster management officer Nandan Singh Rajwal said, “We will be holding a meeting regarding this pond tomorrow (Tuesday). Its construction work is a priority.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/villagers-pool-money-to-rebuild-gauri-kund-destroyed-in-2013-flood/articleshow/81517805.cms||Shivani Azad

They submitted their objections on the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) and sought a public hearing of the mapping to raise their issues. “The Goa government does not feel it important to consult the fishing community and its legitimate representatives, while formulating the most important piece of policy, meant to protect the coastal lands and secure our livelihoods,” GRE general secretary, Olencio Simoes said. Goa has the smallest coastline of 105km and a land mass of 3,704 sqkm with many intervening tidal rivers with more than 40 estuarine, eight marine and about 90 riverine islands. GRE pointed out that fishermen’s huts, fishing zones up to 12 nautical miles, demarcation of fish landings and canoe parking, net mending area, fish breeding area, beach stretches, among other aspects crucial for the fishermen must be highlighted in the plan. They demanded that port limits and aquaculture be deleted in all fishing villages. In their letter, GRE pointed also out that public participation in regulatory decision-making is crucial in making environmental governance more robust and better informed. “Public hearing acts as a check on the arbitrary exercise of powers, especially since it seeks to hear those who could be affected by changes in the eco-system. It thereby embodies the fundamental rule of fair procedure,” GRE said. They also pointed out that the change of venue from the Taleigao Community hall to Kala Academy, Campal just two days prior to the public hearing was a violation of the EIA notification 2006 which has laid down clear procedure to conduct a public hearing in Appendix IV.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fishermen-group-submits-objections-to-draft-coastal-plan/articleshow/81519017.cms||---

Axis Bank has handed over 150 machines to the civic body. The sanitation department has successfully completed the trial of collecting the garbage lifting charges through the machines in Sector 5 residential area, and now this system will be replicated throughout the city from Wednesday. The MC will charge the monthly garbage collecting fee from January, when they had introduced the system to collect segregated trash through twin-bin vehicles. As the system was initially started from the northern sectors, the residents of these areas will have to pay from January, while in southern sectors, the system started just a few days back, so they will pay after one month. “We will hand over POS machines to the helpers and drivers of the garbage collecting vehicles, and the amount will be taken as per the decision of the general house,” sources said. A meeting of the sanitation department was held on Monday evening, where all the officials and employees concerned were briefed about the new exercise to make it comfortable and practically viable for the both residents as well as the workers. Earlier the MC had kept an option of collecting garbage charges through the water bills, but during a study, it was found that water connections were fewer than the kitchens in the city. “In many multi-storey houses, there is only one water connection, but multiple families live, so collecting charges through water bills was not viable and thus POS machines were proposed,” sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/payment-of-garbage-collection-fee-through-point-of-sale-machines/articleshow/81519023.cms||Deepak Yadav

The policeman has been identified as Pandurang Khandvi (45). Four other people, including Khandvi’s wife and two children, sustained serious injuries in the accident that took place at 7.45 pm. Police inspector Vishwajeet Jadhav of Wadivarhe police station said the deceased and his family were going towards Mumbai from Nashik when a collision took place between their car and an unidentified truck in the Raigad Nagar area. “Both the vehicles, truck and the car, were on the same lane. Since all the victims in the accidents are not in a position to give any statement it is yet to be ascertained how the accident took place,” Jadhav said.

Many city roads will be taken up for resurfacing and repairs. With polls slated for early next year, corporatorsare keen to carry out bhoomipoojans of road work in their constituencies. While BMC officials said the road works were planned and being undertaken after site inspection, the opposition warned that if they are taken up in a rush, it could lead to a 2017-like road scam which had revealed that work on 34 roads was shoddy. TimesViewEvery year BMC spends crores on road works but the quality of roads hasn’t improved as expected. Many roads are riddled with potholes soon after rains. The road scam had exposed malpractice in repair work and BMC must learn from it. Road work must have quality control mechanisms in place.“BMC is again making the same mistake... Many roads that are in good condition are being taken up for repairs... BMC must re-look at all roads proposed to be taken up for repairs and select those that really need resurfacing,” said Samajwadi Party corporator and MLA Rais Shaikh. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said, “This will lead to another scam. BMC must have a third-party audit of all roads. Those roads taken up for repair must be audited before repairs to see if they actually need repairs. There must be an internal and external audit so that there is no scam. Random trial pits must be taken at all sites,” Mishra said. Road works worth Rs. 1,200 crores are in different stages of processing, said P Velrasu, BMC’s additional commissioner (projects). “...What is tendered out is the list of works of top priority as assessed by roads department and ward officers,” Velrasu said. “BMC will put in robust supervision mechanism to supervise quality of work... including third-party assessment,”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ahead-of-election-bmcs-on-a-roll-with-road-works-in-mumbai/articleshow/81520587.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Earlier, the civic body had floated tenders on four occasions, but it did not receive any response. But now two private agencies have filed their bids to operate the C&D waste management project in the city. “Disposing debris from demolition and construction sites is a major issue in the city. It also causes air pollution. The Centre has also provided Rs 20.5 crore to take various measures for improving the city’s air quality. We have prepared a blueprint to reduce air pollution, which also includes the C&D waste project,” S Vanjari, NMC executive engineer (environment), said. “We had recently floated a tender in this connection and for the first time have received a response to the bid,” he added. The civic body will provide land to the contractor where construction and demolition waste would be recycled. The construction waste, which is not usable or can’t be recycled, will be sent to the dumping ground as identified by the municipal corporation.The list of dumping grounds in all six divisions — Nashik East, Nashik West, Nashik Road, Satpur, Cidco and Panchavati — will be given the contractor for carrying out the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/2-agencies-bid-for-nashiks-cd-waste-mgmt-project/articleshow/81519063.cms||Tushar Pawar

Candidates who have a degree in MCom (statistics) and have cleared NET or SLET in Commerce, are faced with disqualification. These candidates are of the view that there is no provision to do NET or SLET with statistics as the main subject so they have no choice but to take the entrance exam required to qualify for job as assistant professor, with commerce as the chosen subject. “The people who are involved in the document verification process lack such basic understanding,” said a candidate who has applied for the post. After a hiatus of over two decades, the Gujarat government had this January announced a recruitment drive to enlist 927 assistant professors in grant-in aid colleges. Candidates were to apply online to participate in the recruitment process. These professors will be recruited across 44 different programmes in grant-in aid colleges in the state. Besides, the government has also announced recruitment process for 5,700 assistant teachers in schools. The recruitment has been on hold in grant-in-aid schools for about 15 years now. The recruitment drive is aimed to add a workforce of 6,600 youth in the area of higher education in Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/asst-prof-candidates-hit-verification-hurdle/articleshow/81519094.cms||---

On Sunday, the daily fresh cases tally had crossed the 400-mark for the fourth consecutive day. Delhi on Saturday had recorded 419 Covid-19 cases while the positivity rate stood at 0.56%. On Sunday, the city reported 407 cases and the positivity rate was 0.60%. On Friday, Delhi had recorded 431 cases, the highest in over two months, and the count on Thursday was 409. The Covid-19 death climbed to 10,944 on Monday, with three more fatalities being reported in the national capital, the bulletin said. The numbers had started to come down in February. On February 26, the month’s highest daily count of 256 cases was recorded. Meanwhile, the new coronavirus cases recorded on Monday took the infection tally to 6,44,064, the bulletin said. The number of active cases of the disease in the city rose to 2,321 from 2,262 on Sunday. Health experts and doctors have attributed this “sudden rise” to people turning complacent, not following Covid-appropriate behaviour and “assuming all is well now”. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said the pandemic situation in the national capital is “under control” as long as the positivity rate is below 1%. The situation in Maharashtra and a few other states, where high positivity rates are being recorded, is different, Jain asserted. “In Maharashtra, 16,620 cases were recorded (on Sunday) with a positivity rate of 16.46%, in Kerala, the figures were 1,792 with 3.54% positivity rate. In Punjab, it was 1,492 cases with 4.81%, and in Gujarat, it was 810 cases with 1.78% positivity rate. But in Delhi, it was 407 cases with 0.60% positivity rate,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/daily-covid-tally-goes-under-400-positivity-rate-down-to-0-59/articleshow/81519106.cms||---
---||Mumbai||20k Mumbai autos get revised meters but union says can be rigged||Mumbai: With 20,000 autos now sporting the recalibrated meters with Rs 21 as minimum fare, union leader Thampy Kurian alleged that these can still be rigged using an external wire and a switch. The city also has close to 500 kaali-peeli cabs with the recalibrated meters. Each meter is being fitted by an authorised repairer using chips supplied by RTO-approved meter manufacturers. The meter then undergoes a bench test (testing it for a 48km run and fixing the first seal on it) before it is affixed to the auto or taxi and run on test tracks in the presence of RTO officials—who give their final seal and stamp on it. Kurien said, “Although a majority of drivers and owner are honest and will refrain from rigging meters, this is still possible and is done by rogues at airports, railway stations and ST stands.” Kurien further said, “The pulse of the meter is manipulated to show inflated readings. This is usually done clandestinely, with passengers not knowing. For example, the meter will run properly for 2km. But at the next signal, when the vehicle is stationary, the driver will quietly press a switch hidden under the seat or near the gear which will ensure that the meter drops faster than normal. The final fare will be close to double the usual fare, and those who are not regular travellers will fail to notice.” RTO officials said on Sunday they have made meter tests on their tracks stringent but unions alleged there were agents who demanded up to Rs 300 to get an auto taxi meter passed. Maqbool Mujawar from Navbharatiya Shiv Vahtuk Sanghatana said, “We have asked auto drivers to not fall prey to such unscrupulous elements.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/20k-mumbai-autos-get-revised-meters-but-union-says-can-be-rigged/articleshow/81519089.cms||Somit Sen

Officials said despite testing positive on March 11, she had stepped out for a film shoot. According to the complaint, when officials reached Khan’s home at Oshiwara, Andheri, on Sunday, she refused to open the door and allowed herself to get hand-stamped only after several requests. “We received a complaint that she was moving around, risking her life and that of others too. When our staff reached her home on Sunday night, her husband initially said she was in a flat in the adjacent wing. We decided to take police help following which Khan allowed us to stamp her. We have now asked her to move into institutional quarantine at the PWD guest house, while her high-risk contacts have been asked to quarantine themselves too,” assistant municipal commissioner Vishwas Mote said. Khan’s father passed away earlier this month. Officials did not confirm if he was infected as well. They said Khan had two reports—a positive report dated March 11 from Mumbai, and a Delhi report of March 12 showing she was negative. “Even if one report is positive, quarantine is mandatory,” said Mote. Police spokesperson DCP S Chaitanya said a case has been registered against the actor under various sections of the IPC as well as under the NDMA Act and Epidemic Diseases Act. TOI reached out to Gauahar Khan, but she did not respond.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-actor-booked-for-going-on-shoot-after-testing-ve/articleshow/81519082.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Lucknow||1.2 lakh Covid-19 tests must be conducted daily: Yogi Adityanath to DMs||LUCKNOW: Upset at the falling number of Covid-19 tests in the state, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has directed all district magistrates and field officers to ensure that no less than 1.25 lakh tests are conducted each day. The CM office has shot off a letter to all districts, pushing for higher testing, even as the state has been recording a steady increase of cases over the past few days. At the peak of Covid-19 outbreak between August and October, UP had been conducting 1.5-1.8 lakh tests daily. Over the past week, numbers have dwindled from 1.1 lakh tests to just about 90,000. “There are a few reasons for this drop, including a shortage of available testing material, the weekend, etc. Shortages have been addressed now and the state will ramp up testing to a minimum of 1.25 lakh within this week. The CM has made it clear that no carelessness on this front will be tolerated,” said an official. Meanwhile, though the number of positive cases being reported per day in UP is not as high as in many other states, there is a worrying rise, especially as Holi is drawing near and people from other states are returning home. On Monday, against 90,537 tests, 151 persons were reported positive while 162 were discharged after treatment. The highest number of cases was in Lucknow where 35 cases were reported, followed by Varanasi with 12 positive cases. Two deaths were reported from the state which included one each from Moradabad and Shahjahanpur. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to hold a video conference with chief ministers of all states on Wednesday to discuss the unfolding Covid situation. Any changes in current protocols, including vaccinations, will be discussed during that meeting,” the official said. Additional chief secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad said that till 8pm, 2.73 lakh people had been vaccinated at 4,513 centres in UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/1-2l-covid-19-tests-must-be-conducted-daily-cm-to-dms/articleshow/81520551.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Hyderabad||HC turns down CBI probe plea in double murder case, says monitoring investigation||Hyderabad: The Telangana high court on Monday declined to entertain the idea of handing over to CBI the ongoing probe into the double murder case of advocate couple Gattu Vaman Rao and PV Nagamani, but warned the Telangana police not to allow any nonchalant attitude to set in among its probe teams and keep in mind the gravity of the situation where the criminals had acted with a sense of impunity by going to the extent of stalling the traffic for 20 minutes in a busy area and hacked the lawyer couple to death in full public glare. The division bench comprising Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy that took up the case on its own after seeing media reports on the ghastly incident directed the state police to enlist as many eyewitnesses as possible. Advocate General BS Prasad furnished to the court a sealed cover of the latest status report. The bench noted the fact that statements of the witnesses are now being recorded before a judicial magistrate after its previous direction. The police, it can be recalled, were directed in the last hearing not to relax after recording the confession statements of the accused in the police stations and also to get them recorded by a judicial magistrate under section 164 of CrPC. It was at this stage, the counsel for Gattu Kishan Rao, father of slain advocate Vaman Rao—who filed a separate petition seeking a CBI probe into the incident on the ground that they have no faith in the state police—raised the issue of a CBI probe. The bench told him that they are monitoring the ongoing probe. “Let us not derail it at this stage. We did not wait till your arrival before us, we took up the cause on our own. Our sympathies are with you but we cannot disturb the ongoing probe which is going in the right direction, the bench said. If the matter is entrusted to the CBI now, the whole thing comes to naught, and even handing over and taking over of the probe will take a long time. We cannot afford to do that now, the bench said. AG Prasad informed the court that they had identified 25 witnesses so far. “We could get the statements of 19 of them recorded before a magistrate,” he added. The case was posted to April 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-turns-down-cbi-probe-plea-in-double-murder-case-says-monitoring-investigation/articleshow/81519101.cms||---

With this observation, the bench quashed an order of January 15, 2020, passed by cane commissioner, permitting the petitioner candidates to participate in the interview to be held in pursuance of advertisement issued by UP Subordinate Service Selection Commission on October 5, 2016, for the post of cane supervisor. A bench of Justice Chandra Dhari Singh passed the verdict on the writ petitions moved by over half-a-dozen candidates. The petitioners’ lawyer Badrish Kumar Tripathi had submitted that the petitioners had applied for the post of cane supervisor in 2016. When they appeared in the interview before the commission, they were denied interview on the ground that they possessed either B Tech or BSc which were not equivalent to CCC certificate as required in the advertisement. Allowing the petitions, the bench said, “The objective of the 'CCC' course is to enable a student to acquire the knowledge pertaining to fundamental of information technology. In the present case, admittedly, the petitioners do not possess the 'CCC' certificate, but they possess the equivalent qualification from other recognized institutions and it makes them suitable to fulfill requirements of employer for the posts in question.” Earlier, the petitioners’ lawyer had cited several rulings and government orders to indicate that a candidate having equivalent degree or diploma would not be denied of opportunity if he did not possess CCC certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-quashes-ruling-of-cane-commissioner-on-ccc-cert/articleshow/81520580.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Despite mega vaccine drive, only 4,859 people turn up to receive jab||PANAJI: Despite organising vaccination camps at 33 centres across the state to expedite the inoculation of the target population – 60 plus citizens and those aged between 45-59 years with comorbidities – only 4,859 people in these two categories received their first dose on Monday. Prior to Monday’s drive, the daily average was about 2,500 to 3,000 vaccinations a day. The vaccination camps continue on Tuesday as well. Judging by the current pace of vaccination of these two categories, an official said they would need two months to cover all of them. The health department estimates 1.5 lakh senior citizens and another 1.5 lakh, in the age bracket of 45-59 years, who have comorbidities will be vaccinated. The officer said though Monday’s figures were much more than daily vaccination numbers, these could have been higher. “We are doing our best, but others should also help,” he said. Most of the people who received their first dose of the vaccine on Monday did not do prior registration. “Most did their registration on the spot and received their shots,” he said. “With complaints of inability to register on the portal, people have been allowed to opt for spot registration. Not just in the villages but elsewhere too, people have got vaccinated by opting for the jab at the last minute,” he said. Till Monday, about 37,000 people of both categories were vaccinated. He said their attempts are also on to have more private hospitals on board to conduct vaccination on a larger scale. Another officer said that mobilisation of people has not happened on expected lines, a task which should have been taken up by panchayats by convincing people to get vaccinated. “With Goa’s infrastructure and availability of trained manpower, we ought to have more people vaccinated by now. Many people are still reluctant to take the jab afraid, that something might happen to them while there could be other factors responsible too,” he said. The health officer said that if the pace of vaccination does not improve, they will have to conduct vaccination camps at village level. “The mega camp has been organised because we want more people to get vaccinated at the earliest. We are afraid the second wave is not far away as cases are increasing all over India and in states very close to ours. It’s better that our vulnerable population is vaccinated as soon as possible,” state immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said. Nodal officer for vaccination at Hospicio Hospital Dr Ira Almeida too appealed to seniors to get vaccinated. “The aim of the government was to target the vulnerable population in the quickest possible time so as to build enough immunity before the second wave hits us,” she said,||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/despite-mega-vaccine-drive-only-4859-people-turn-up-to-receive-jab/articleshow/81519095.cms||---

The figures for 2016-17 were much higher but the effect of the Shetkari Sanman Yojana resulted in loan waiver to a certain extent. This year too there was partial loan waiver but there was much less work in the Covid-19 period when the banking sector could not perform as efficiently as in other times. There were other factors as the farmers received a setback due to the unavailability of labourers and failure in getting decent returns for the produce.Ardhendu Shekhar, manager of a leading banker, said the district collector conducted reviews of the bankers and encouraged them to increase the credit to the farmers. “This is the reason banks showed a fantastic performance this year,” he said. The loan target for kharif crop for banks was set at Rs 3,304 crore, out of which Rs 2,302 crore loan (70%) was disbursed.The loan target for rabi crop was Rs 1,420 crore and banks disbursed a whopping Rs 569 crore, totalling the disbursement to Rs 2,871 crore. Last year, the disbursement stood at Rs 1,930 crore (43%) of the annual target that year and it was Rs 1,947 crore in 2018-19, which was 52% of the annual target that year. The officials are still optimistic about increasing the loans for rabi this year as there are multiple projects in the pipeline and farmers take loan for irrigating projects around this time of the year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/banks-achieve-best-farm-loandisbursement-target-in-4-yrs/articleshow/81519110.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Delhi||First patient with South Africa variant confirmed in Delhi||NEW DELHI: A 33-year-old man admitted to Lok Nayak Hospital has become the first person to be confirmed positive in the city for Covid-19 caused by the South Africa variant of novel coronavirus. There are at least four more such cases in other parts of the country. Dr Suresh Kumar, the medical director of the hospital, told TOI that the man was from Kerala. “He tested positive for Covid-19 on return from South Africa nine days ago and was immediately shifted to our hospital. Today, we received reports confirming that he is infected with the South Africa variant,” Dr Kumar said. According to him, the patient is asymptomatic. However, to ensure that the infection doesn’t spread, he has been kept under strict isolation, the doctor said. “We have created a special ward to isolate him so that the other patients suffering from Covid-19 caused by the UK variant or the original strain don’t get mixed.” Multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2, such as UK, South Africa and Brazil ones, are now circulating globally. According to Centre for Disease Control, US, in January 2021, scientists from the UK reported evidence that suggests B.1.1.7 — the variant that originated there — may be associated with an increased risk of death compared with other variants. The South Africa variant shares some mutations with the UK strain, it suggests. “In Brazil, a variant of SARS-CoV-2 (known as P.1) emerged that was first identified in four travellers from Brazil, who were tested during routine screening at Haneda airport outside Tokyo, Japan. This variant has 17 unique mutations,” the US body says. “Scientists are working to learn more about these variants to better understand how easily they may be transmitted and the effectiveness of currently authorised vaccines against them,” it adds. The South Africa variant was first reported in Africa in December, but no case of Covid-19 caused by it had reached India till about a month ago. Four such cases were confirmed by the Union health ministry last month. “The spread of newer variants is concerning. While there are no studies to suggest the new variants are more fatal, some of them are more infective,” Dr Sumit Ray, vice-chairperson of critical care at Holy Family Hospital, said. Dr Kumar said the newer variants might not necessarily be more fatal. “We have seen 28 cases caused by the UK variant at our hospital. Most of them were asymptomatic and they were discharged after testing negative,” he said. Lok Nayak Hospital, run by Delhi government, has been designated for isolation of Covid-19 patients with a history of travel to other countries, especially those where mutated strains have been confirmed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/first-patient-with-s-africa-variant-confirmed-in-city/articleshow/81519185.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The police said the patrons were dining and dancing to the tunes of an international disc jockey when the pub was raided around 11.30pm. Some of the patrons were foreign nationals, mostly from African countries, the police said. This was the second raid of its kind in a little over two weeks. On February 28, the police raided a prominent pub in Mohammadwadi and found 104 people, mostly young men and women, partying well beyond midnight. In the instant case, the police have registered a case for offences under sections 188 (disobedience) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread any disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code and also under the Covid-19 Rules and Disaster Management Act. Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Namrata Patil told TOI, “A party was going on in the pub even after the 10pm deadline. We found the DJs were playing loud music when the police team raided the place.” Patil said, “The party goers at the pub were from different parts of the city. We have taken action against 72 people. Some of them are foreigners. We summoned our women personnel from the Wanowrie, Mundhwa and Market Yard police stations on noticing presence of women in the party.” She added, “The party goers were later sent to Hadapsar police station. The process of recording their statements and collecting more details about the party and its organizers was in progress till late Monday evening. The organizers should have not continued the party beyond the 10pm deadline,” she added. A TOI team on Monday afternoon visited the pub, but the facility was closed after the police action. A man posted at the facility said the pub staffers had been taken to the police station for questioning. On Sunday, the Koregaon Park police registered FIRs relating to disobedience against the proprietors and managers of four restaurants operating in lane numbers six and seven of the area. Senior inspector Dilip Shinde on Monday told TOI, “These restaurants were attending to more than the specified capacity of customers and had not displayed boards on seat availability. All this violated Covid safety norms” Shinde said, “We have received instructions from senior police officers to take action against eateries operating beyond the 10pm deadline. A police team was conducting patrolling and found the restaurants operating in violation of the safety norms.” He explained, “The restaurants had failed to display boards showing availability of seats and the number of customers present/waiting and the employees working. For instance, if a restaurant has the capacity to attend to 150 customers, then it should deal with 75 patrons at a time. This arrangement has been made to contain the spread of Covid-19 virus.” “The action against the restaurants was taken under the IPC and Disaster Management Act,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-raid-hadapsar-pub-operating-beyond-10pm-deadline-book-72/articleshow/81519154.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Mumbai||In Mumbai, 21,000 more citizens died last year compared to 2019||MUMBAI: Nearly 21,000 more deaths (about 23%) were recorded last year in Mumbai compared to 2019—it was 1.1 lakh in 2020 and 91,223 the previous year—underscoring the impact the pandemic had on the population. The official Covid fatality count is 11,116, which accounts for barely half the spike in mortalities and thus leaves an incomplete picture of the exact toll. The trend has been seen worldwide with a large percentage of excess deaths in the pandemic year not being included in official Covid toll. Mumbai also had a sharp 19% drop in births last year, reveals BMC data, owing to factors such as the migrant exodus and pregnancies deferred during the outbreak. Experts say the remaining ‘non-Covid’ mortalities may likely include people who could not access healthcare on time and passed away at home, or died due to Covid but remained undiagnosed. ‘Mumbai saw 24% rise in mortality over previous 5-year average’In all, the city had 1.11 lakh deaths from all causes in 2020, up nearly 23% from 2019 (91,223) and 26% over 2018 (88,852). Covid-19 accounted for 10% of them and 54% of the additional deaths over the previous year. While the city's first positive cases were detected in March, Mumbai saw big surges in mortality starting May. The trend continued till July before returning to a normal range of 8,000-9,000 deaths per month in August. May, by far, had the highest death registrations (14,328) compared to 7,335 and 7,407 in the corresponding period in 2019 and 2018 respectively. The complete month-wise data for 2020 is not yet public. Murad Banaji, a London-based mathematician who tracks Mumbai’s Covid graph, tweeted, “2020 data shows a huge 24% rise in mortality over the previous 5-year average.” Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said ‘cause of death’ reports are still being analysed. “Once those are finalised, we will have a clearer picture of what contributed to higher fatalities,” she said. A civic official said while calculating excess mortality, one must factor in the year-on-year rise of 2%-2.5% in deaths. According to P Arokiasamy, professor at International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), all-cause deaths are a crucial tool to understand the devastation wrought by the pandemic. “Due to the strict lockdown, unavailability of transport and closure of many hospitals, chronic patients of cancer, kidney disease, hypertension and diabetes suffered immense hardships as they couldn’t access medical care. An age-wise analysis will provide a better picture as the pandemic affected older population disproportionately,” he said, adding that migration too took its toll as those displaced could not access basic care. Studying excess mortality could bring unique insights to the pandemic’s real impact on a city, said Dr Avinash Supe, head of Covid death audit committee. The world over, lakhs of more people died during the pandemic year, who were not in official Covid death counts. US, for instance, has reportedly had 17% excess deaths between March and December, while badly-hit countries like Brazil and Spain have seen between 21% to 23%. As far as births go, the drop in Mumbai is a direct fallout of migration and the economic hardships it brought, said Arokiasamy. The city had 1.20 lakh births, a steep decline from 1.48lakh births in 2019. “While Mumbai has been seeing a nearly 2% year-on-year decline in births, a 19% drop was exponential,” said a civic official. Reasons could range from people returning to their hometowns, cancelled weddings, delayed pregnancies. “Historically, child births have always taken a hit during a health or economic crisis,” said Arokiasamy. A civic official said many women from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region who deliver in Mumbai’s hospitals could not access them during the lockdown and that may have dented numbers. “It will be interesting to see if Mumbai’s satellite towns have seen corresponding rise in births,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-saw-24-rise-in-mortality-over-previous-5-year-average/articleshow/81519161.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The strike has been called to oppose the Centre’s move to privatise three banks and union workers said that a larger strike could be held in the coming months. While ATMs were functional, financial transactions such as cheque deposits and withdrawals were affected at nationalised banks. Private banks were also operational. The employees also held a protest meet at Azad Maidan where they said that privatisation of the banks would hurt the customer and the employees. “This two-day strike is not enough and the government will not listen to us. More calls for strikes will come and we will have to remain united to the cause and to the call that they will give. We request the public to support us also,” said union leader Santosh Haldankar. UFBU is an umbrella body of nine bank unions which called for a nationwide strike on March 15 and 16. UFBU has opposed the various announcements made in the Union Budget regarding reform measures like privatization of IDBI Bank and two public sector banks, setting up of Bad Bank, disinvestment in LIC, privatization of one insurance company, allowing FDI in insurance sector upto 74%, aggressive disinvestment and sale of public sector undertakings. The bank employees said that privatisation of banks will lead to loss of jobs, closure of branches in the rural areas. Union leaders also said that the reservation policies for SC, ST and OBC will be will scrapped. “The corporates who have looted the country have gone and now the government wants to give the banks to the same corporates to loot the country further. We will be meeting soon and we will have to gather in bigger numbers to oppose the move,” said Nitin Thakur, a bank officer with a nationalized bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/psu-bank-strike-cripples-services-across-state-on-day-1/articleshow/81519136.cms||---

---||India||Waze was evasive, didn’t ask for legal counsel: NIA to court||MUMBAI: When Sachin Waze came to the National Investigation Agency’s (NIA) office on Saturday morning, he neither had his phone on him nor did he share the phone numbers of his family members to enable the officers to apprise them of his arrest late at night, the investigating agency told the special court on Monday. Special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves said the NIA then informed Waze’s department of his arrest. “A police officer of his rank did not even carry his phones,” he said. On Sunday, suspended API Waze was remanded to NIA custody until March 25 in connection with the probe into the recovery of explosives from an SUV found parked near businessman Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence on February 25. During Monday’s hearing, defence advocate Sudeep Pasbola claimed that Waze was illegally detained prior to his production before court for his remand. Once an accused is arrested, he has to be produced before the court within 24 hours. Pasbola submitted that Waze was called on Saturday morning and shown arrested only late in the night; he was kept in illegal detention for more than 12 hours. The NIA, however, claimed that Waze was called to their office at 11am in his capacity as the previous investigating officer in the case, and not as an accused. The agency said that Waze, who was called for some clarifications and for recording his statement, arrived around 11.30am. The NIA further said that subsequently, it found that there were issues with his case diary and seizures, and that the memos were not prepared properly. Standing in the witness box, the investigating officer also told the court that when asked to clarify certain aspects, Waze did not give proper answers. He added that Waze, at one point, started “talking about something else”. The NIA said Waze was finally arrested at 11.50pm. Replying to Pasbola’s submission that Waze was neither given his right to a legal counsel nor his family was informed of his arrest, Gonsalves said the claims were incorrect. In fact, Waze did not ask for legal counsel, Gonsalves said. “He’s a police officer and knows the provisions of the law... especially when he facing such grave charges. How can we tell him that he has a right to a legal counsel? Had he given the numbers of his family members, we would have contacted them,” he added. The NIA said that Waze’s lawyer can remain present during some duration while the suspended police officer is in custody and the schedule will be decided on Tuesday. The defence also raised the issue of no CCTV footage of Waze’s questioning, citing the guidelines which mandate the presence of cameras in interrogation rooms to ensure that third degree is not used. Gonsalves said that Waze was kept in the superintendent of police’s cabin from the time he arrived at the NIA office and not taken to the interrogation room. He submitted that while the NIA office has CCTV cameras, the SP’s cabin did not. He added that the interrogation room has a video camera, but there is no audio. When Pasbola said the NIA should put this down in writing, Gonsalves said that he would do it on Tuesday. The hearing will continue on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/waze-was-evasive-didnt-ask-for-legal-counsel-nia-to-court/articleshow/81521651.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Lucknow||Govt transferred Rs 56k cr to beneficiaries’ accounts in ’20||Lucknow: The UP government in 2020 transferred Rs 56,000 crore directly into bank accounts of beneficiaries of various schemes being run by Central and the state government. A government spokesperson said that due to the direct bank transfers (DBT) the government had saved Rs 4,402.05 crore in a single year. “Many irregularities were committed earlier in transferring funds under various government schemes. This practice has been stopped now. Due to DBT, middlemen have been eliminated from the process and the entire procedure has been made transparent,” he said. Now, the government transfers money directly into bank accounts of beneficiaries of 136 schemes of 27 departments. Under the DBT process the government has not only succeeded in preventing leakages, but it has also saved Rs 4,402.05 crore in seven schemes of the Central and state governments. During the Covid induced lockdown last year, the government transferred funds to accounts of lakhs of farmers, MNREGA workers, migrant labourers, women, students and pensioners. The government also transferred Rs 2,806.10 crore as subsidy on gas cylinders, Rs 1,412 crore for ration cards made under the National Food Security Scheme, Rs 162.58 crore under Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme, Rs 16.69 crore under the Old Age Pension Scheme, Rs 1.55 lakh under National Agricultural Development Scheme, Rs 1.92 lakh under Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme and Rs 4.63 crore under Divyang Pension Scheme. “DBT helped us to verify a beneficiary’s Aadhar and mobile number easily and money is transferred into the Jan Dhan account without hassles. The practice helps in eradicating middlemen as well as identifying real beneficiaries,” the spokesperson said. The government has said that over the past four years, Rs 2.53 lakh crore has been paid to farmers through DBT under various schemes. This includes Rs 36,000 crore as loan waivers, Rs 64,000 crore as minimum support price, Rs 1.22 lakh crore to sugarcane farmers and Rs 27,101 crore to 2.42 crore farmers under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. The rural development department has reported that over 1.14 crore workers were given employment under MNREGA till March 5, 2021. During this period, Rs 7,669.34 crore was paid to them. On December 18, Rs 445.92 crore was transferred through DBT to women help groups and their organizations working under the National Rural Livelihood Mission. Another Rs 1625.47 crore was transferred to OBC students in the last four years as scholarship, Rs 27.95 lakh to beneficiaries of the destitute women pension and Rs 112.22 crore under Kanya Sumangala Yojana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-transferred-rs-56k-cr-to-beneficiaries-accounts-in-20/articleshow/81520622.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The funds will be spent on developing the forest and to increase its green cover. “The recently held budget session of the state assembly approved the funds,” BJP MLA Madhauri Misal who represents Parvati constituency said at a press conference on Monday. The work comes under the umbrella project being implemented on 810 acres by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and by the forest department on 980 acres across the city. Bamboo plantation, an open air amphitheatre, construction of an entrance gate, water management, a yoga centre and a playground for children are on the anvil. Misal said the state government had also assured of financial help for the Ambil Odha development project but no funds have been allocated as yet. The project was planned after the massive flood in September 2019 that caused extensive damage to properties, roads and also loss of lives along the stream. “The natural calamity caused financial losses to the locals. They were expected to get help but no budgetary allocation has been made,” she said. Funds have not been given to other big projects in the city like the high capacity mass transit route and Swargate to Katraj metro rail, nor was any allocation made for the 23 merged villages which will hamper their development projects, Misal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-grants-rs-13-crore-to-conserve-taljai-hill/articleshow/81519181.cms||---

There were no new taxes and the tax rates also have been kept unchanged. However, the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) will intensify its property tax collection. The target for property tax collection for the next fiscal has been fixed at Rs 340 crore as against the average collection of Rs 266 crore. The key focus will be to enhance the city’s green initiatives besides providing services to newly merged areas. “There are arrears of Rs 900 crore of which some cases are under litigation, but Rs 325 crore are recoverable. We will form a tax recovery cell to collect dues aggressively and recover the arrears. We are also geotagging the properties and around 8,000 more properties which have not been paying taxes are now included in tax net,” he said. The area under RMC was 127.21 square km in 2015 which has increased to 161.86 sq km after merging Mota Mauva, Munjka, Ghanteshwar and Madhapar villages in June 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/focus-on-green-rajkot-100-more-e-buses-to-run-in-city/articleshow/81519174.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Ensure ESZ notification is followed in Mt Abu: NGT||Jaipur: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) heard the case challenging the Zonal Master Plan, 2030 (ZMP 2030) for the Mount Abu Eco-Sensitive Zone (ESZ). It ruled that ZMP must be revised in three months and apart from giving effect to the recommendations regarding ban and restrictions on construction, protection of rocks by not permitting a ropeway or sport climbing is to be ensured. The tribunal also ordered that ESZ notification be duly compiled and placed in public domain and any construction in violation of ESZ notification be stopped.Grounds of the challenge were that the ESZ notification failed to discourage construction activities at or near the heritage sites, conserve the existing waterbodies, permits change of land use by illegal structures. Rock climbing has also been permitted, including sport climbing by fixing permanent anchors. Construction has been allowed on green tracks to benefit some builders.Following this a committee was constituted to look into the matter. Last year, the committee filed a report which mentioned that two buffers (100 metre and 200 metre radius) have been formed around 10 identified sites within ESZ. The committee looked into the change in land use through high resolution satellite images, as available on Google Earth. The data has been duly analysed with particular reference to 10 identified sites, said the NGT order.NGT said that the revision of ZMP may be undertaken by the concerned authorities, in consultation with the nine-member committee constituted by the Tribunal. “All blank patches of lands within the ESZ must be greened up by the municipal corporation. Buffers around drains, wetlands and forests be duly maintained and protected. The authorities may ensure proper functioning of STP and its connectivity to the sewer lines, utilization of treated sewage, management of solid waste and overall environmental quality. We direct that consideration of NOC by the forest department should be prompt and a decision must be taken within one month from date of the application, failing which the officer delaying the matter should be held accountable,” said the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ensure-esz-notification-is-followed-in-mt-abu-ngt/articleshow/81519177.cms||---

Another family is taking out a cycle yatra but is not aware of ground reality,” Singh said, addressing the state executive meeting on Monday. “2022 mein bicycle ki 22 seatein bhi nahi aayengi (Samajwadi Party will not get even 22 seats in 2022),” he said. Claiming that the BJP government made fair appointments in jobs, Singh said: “In the past, the appointment lists used to come from Saifai.” “The benefit of government’s welfare schemes have been passed on to all. Under previous governments of SP and BSP, it was decided on the basis of caste and religion,” he added. “Media is terming panchayat elections as a semi-final to Vidhan Sabha elections but the party has won in the past too. BJP has won elections for teachers and graduates constituencies on its own,” he said. Singh added the BJP gave the vision of new ‘rashtravaad’ (nationalism) in 2014 which was about great personalities like Swami Vivekanand, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Dr BR Ambedkar and Veer Savarkar. “Power is a medium to change country’s future. For a party to peform its best, karyakarta (worker), kosh (funds), karyakram (programme) and karyalaya (office) are required. State BJP is getting 81 party offices of which 53 are complete,” he said. “We are into ‘vaccine maitri’ (vaccine diplomacy) and sending it to other countries. Covid management in the country and state has been appreciated nationally and internationally,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-wont-get-even-22-seats-in-2022-polls-up-bjp-chief/articleshow/81520659.cms||---

Big ticket infrastructure spending was also missing from the proposals except works related to housing,water and drainage.Seven flyovers, a sports complex, a vegetable market, an art gallery and other works were proposed in the last civic budget as it was the last budget of the elected wing before it term ended. This time around, only one flyover has been taken up. The other major works include those for drainage, water supply and others. Work on housing schemes, zoo and fire and emergency services will continue this year too.The budget also focuses on providing services in the newly added areas of the city. Provisions have been made for water supply and drainage networks in these areas. VMC is also looking to provide street lights in the peripheral areas of the city in collaboration with the Vadodara Urban Development Authority.Municipal commissioner Swaroop P said that VMC will also become amongst the few civic bodies in the state to issue bonds. He said that plans for raising Rs 200 crore from bonds had been made, but the civic body will be raising Rs 100 crore in the first phase. While the budget in itself is not a policy decision, the taxes and charges have to be cleared by the general board of the civic body before February 20. As this was not possible, clarity was sought from the state government that allowed these to be passed at a later date. Eventually the taxes and charges were left untouched, but will be cleared at a late date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/no-new-taxes-no-big-spending-either/articleshow/81519217.cms||---

Krishan, now 107, stepped out of his home in south Delhi “for the first time since the coronavirus-induced lockdown was imposed late March, last year,” to get his Covishield jab, his son Anil Krishan said. “We had kept him literally in a bubble, and given the nature of the virus, we decided to keep him safe within the confines of home. Today, we took him in a car to the hospital, where he had undergone a major operation in 2019, got the vaccine shot, and came back,” the 72-year-old said. He added that his father was born in Kartarpur in Jalandhar district on August 4, 1913, just a year before the outbreak of World War I. “In 1930s, he moved to Delhi, and worked in the home and defence ministry, and was later part of the drafting committee of the Constituent Assembly of India. My father really worked hard, and made his way up the ranks. After Independence, he went on to become a deputy secretary in Rajya Sabha,” Anil said. The vaccine shot was given to him at the Fortis Escorts Heart Institute in south Delhi. Dr Ashok Seth, chairmen of the hospital, said two years ago the centenarian had undergone implantation of a stent in the artery of his brain after suffering multiple repeated minor strokes. “It is heartening to see him getting vaccinated safely,” he said. Another centenarian, Tulsi Das Chawla, who was born a few months before the outbreak of the Spanish Flu, had received his first shot of Covid-19 vaccine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on March 5. Khazan Singh, 103, who lives in Dilshad Garden, also took the vaccine at a private facility recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/5-at-the-time-of-spanish-flu-107-yr-old-gets-first-covid-jab/articleshow/81519242.cms||---

Education minister Govind Singh Dotasra was also present in the meeting. “The chief minister assured us that the matter will be referred to the ministerial sub-committee on contractual employees which is headed by B D Kalla. He also said that our issue will be taken up in the committee on a priority basis and will be solved soon,” said Narendra Chaudhary, state president, Rajasthan Vidyarthi Mitra Panchayat Sahayak Sangh.

---||Mumbai||Students from Std I to VIII likely to be promoted without final exams in Maharashtra||Pune: The state education directorate is exploring the possibility of promoting students based on their year-long performance without conducting final exams for standards I to VIII. Director of secondary education, Dattatray Jagtap, said the continuous and comprehensive evaluation during the year will be considered to assess students in view of the rising Covid-19 cases and lockdown in many cities across the state. Jagtap said there is a no-fail policy for standards I to VIII which will continue and grades will be given based on how students have fared throughout the year. The administration had decided to shut down schools around March 18 last year following which schools shifted to the online mode of teaching. Many private schools decided to promote students based on their performance during the year. However, the new academic year was completely online except for two months of offline classes for standards IX and XII and one month of offline classes for standards V to VIII. “With the situation still uncertain and the academic year coming to an end, we are doubtful if offline classes or exams for all classes would be possible. We are also waiting for government instructions on Covid restrictions which are getting stricter by the day with a spike in cases. Hence, in most likelihood, exams may not happen and students will be promoted,” Jagtap said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/students-from-std-i-to-viii-likely-to-be-promoted-without-final-exams-in-maharashtra/articleshow/81519289.cms||---

The committee also passed a host of political resolutions, including endorsement of the construction of Ram Temple as “Aastha ka samman” (respect of faith). The decisions were taken after daylong deliberations presided over by UP BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh and attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh and chief minister Yogi Adityanath. According to the proposal mooted by UP BJP general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal and passed by the committee, the party will organise statewide functions on March 19 to highlight the achievements of the government. The events will be attended by minister in charge, MLAs and MPs. The party will also hold programmes in all 403 assembly constituencies on March 20 to make deeper electoral inroads ahead of panchayat elections. The assembly constituencies where BJP does not have an MLA, an MP or an MLC will be deputed to supervise the programme.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NCB files petition in SC for cancellation of Rhea’s bail||Mumbai: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has filed a special leave petition (SLP) before the Supreme Court to challenge the bail granted to late actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty in a drugs case. Justice Sarang Kotwal of Bombay high court had granted her bail in October 2020 in the case allegedly linked to a “drug angle” in 34-year-old Rajput’s death on June 14 last year. HC had said she was not a part of any drug dealer chain nor was any recovery made from her. The Centre through NCB has sought cancellation of her bail. It filed the SLP on February 19, which was verified on March 12. The agency had filed a 12,000-odd-page chargesheet against Chakraborty and 32 others on March 5. The agency had arrested Chakraborty (28) on September 8, 2020, and termed her an “active member of a drug syndicate’’ and that it wanted to “bust the drug citadel in Mumbai”. NCB invoked Section 27A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) against Chakraborty and her brother Showik Chakraborty alleging the siblings “financed the drug procurement”. The crime is punishable with a minimum 10 years’ imprisonment and a maximum of 20 years. The fresh NCB case is expected to come up for hearing before a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and Rama Subramanian. The likely date of hearing is March 18, says the apex court website. NCB had alleged on some occasions Chakraborty had used her own money to procure drugs for Rajput and she had facilitated the purchase through her brother, Showik, and also relied on the late actor’s staff. Based on its accusations that she had paid for some ganja, NCB had claimed she was an “active member of a drug syndicate” with a large reach. HC, while releasing Chakraborty on bail, said, “I am unable to agree with the submission that giving money to another for consuming drugs would mean encouraging such habit and would mean ‘financing’ or ‘harbouring’ as envisaged under Section 27A of the NDPS Act.”  “Spending money in procuring drugs for Sushant will not, therefore, mean she had financed illicit traffic,” HC had said in its prima facie findings for bail. Reacting to the chargesheet, her lawyer Satish Maneshinde had earlier said in a statement shared with the media: “All efforts of NCB have been directed towards Rhea Chakraborty to somehow rope her in.” He said the SLP filed by the Centre through NCB has yet to be served on Chakraborty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-files-petition-in-sc-for-cancellation-of-rheas-bail/articleshow/81519840.cms||---
---||Pune||Court extends police custody remand of two Army majors||SLUG: PAPER LEAK CASE Pune: The court of special judge S R Navander on Monday extended the police custody remand of Army majors Theru Murugan Tangvelu and Vijay Kilari — arrested in the soldier (general duty) recruitment exam paper leak case — till March 20 and sent retired army man Bharat Laxman Akadmol (35) from Jalgaon to judicial custody for 14 days. Assistant commissioner of police (Crime II) Laxman Borate had produced Tangvelu, Kilari and Akadmol before the court at 3.35pm after the term of their initial remand ended on Monday. Seeking their further remand, the state prosecution told the special court that one of the arrested suspects in the case had promised Tangvelu Rs25 lakh if the question paper of the common entrance exam was leaked. Additional public prosecutor Prem Agarwal submitted that Tangvelu from Tamil Nadu, arrested on March 7, had promised to give a part of the money to Kilari from New Delhi, arrested on March 9. He said Kilari, in turn, had assured to share some money with one of the suspects on the run. Agarwal argued that experts from the forensic science laboratory, Mumbai, had retrieved the deleted cellphone communications/data exchanged in Tamil between the two arrested army officers. He sought time to seek help of interpreters for translating them in local language and confront the officers if any new information related to question paper leak was revealed. He sought sufficient time for police to probe the financial transactions of the suspects, identify the people who received the question paper, trace the source from where the paper was leaked and arrest a suspect on the run. Defence lawyers Rahul Deshmukh and Rahul Lonandakar pleaded to send Tangvelu and Kilari in judicial custody, claiming that their detention in police custody was not essential because the court had given enough time to the investigation officer to question them. The lawyers submitted that their clients could be questioned even in judicial custody after the interpreters translated the seized communication/data retrieved from their cellphones. After hearing both the sides, the court upheld the prosecution’s plea and extended the police custody remand of the arrested army officers till March 20. Lawyer Jyoti Pawar appeared for Akadmol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/court-extends-police-custody-remand-of-two-army-majors/articleshow/81519260.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Paresh alias Indukumar Khimsuriya (25) also went on to become the youngest president of the municipality. Khimsuriya has been running the tyre puncture shop since years. He said, “I had decided since my childhood that I will become the municipality president one day and that dream has eventually come true.” Khimsuriya won the election on a BJP ticket.  Ever since he got the ticket he started a campaign pedalling through his constituency and he started making punctures in the vehicles of his voters. He carried tyres on his shoulders and appealed to people to vote for him because they had seen him make punctures since years and he was approachable to everybody.  Khimsuriya had become the talking point among voters because of his unique way of campaigning. His appeal worked and he won the election from ward two. Rashid Otha, a minority community leader in Bagsara said “He is the youngest president of municipality and looking to his enthusiasm we believe that he will work hard to serve the people and do development work. This is true democracy where a poor man can become the president of municipality.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/puncture-repairer-pedals-to-top-post/articleshow/81519296.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||70 new cases in district; family clusters concern health officials||Coimbatore: The district recorded 70 fresh Covid-19 cases on Monday, which is the highest number of daily count in more than two months. The active cases have increased to 421 from 367 two days ago, taking the total number of cases to 56,543. The Monday case count is 40% higher than cases reported in the last week. Bed occupancy in many private hospitals handling Covid patients has increased. PSG Hospitals’ bed occupancy crossed 100 as on Saturday, compared to the 70-odd it was seeing about a week back. Sources in KMCH too say occupancy rates have begun increasing. Health officers attribute the spike to growing number of family clusters. “Out of the 45 cases within the corporation limits on Monday, 16 were from four family clusters. The remaining 29 are all isolated cases,” says city health officer Dr S Raja.The four clusters are from K K Pudur, Kuniyamuthur, Ganapathy and Vadavalli. “It is difficult to trace the source of the infections because each member of a family could have met many people over the past seven days,” says Dr Raja. “At least 14 people have travel history to other districts and states. We have traced at least 183 people as part of their primary and secondary contacts and have either screened or tested them and told them to isolate themselves,” he added.To reduce the number of family clusters, health officers appealed to people to take Covid tests immediately after experiencing flu-like symptoms and isolate themselves from other family members. “People with symptoms must wear masks within their houses,” said S Raja. Meanwhile, health officers asked people to take the vaccine against the virus. “We don’t know how long antibodies acquired through infection or vaccine last in our body. So unless we take the vaccine in large numbers and develop antibodies at the same time, it is difficult to break the chain of transmission,” a senior official said, adding that, “Vaccinating 4,000 to 5,000 people a day is inadequate. We need to vaccinate the entire 18 lakh people within the corporation limits in three months for herd immunity to develop.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/70-new-cases-in-district-family-clusters-concern-health-officials/articleshow/81519301.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Not in favour of hurried privatisation: Sharma||Lucknow: Is the experience in privatisation of power supply in Agra deterring the state government from replicating the experiments across the state? A comparative study of Torrent Power with Kanpur Electricity Supply Corporation (Kesco) by UPPCL indicates that all is not well with the functioning of the franchise firm for supply in Agra. Energy minister Shrikant Sharma has been vocal about opposing hurried privatisation of the sector to protect interests of power consumers and UPPCL’s assets and infrastructure. He feels the experiment in Agra has not been successful and there should be no hurry to replicate it. The Aggregate Technical and Commercial (A,T and C) losses of Torrent in 2019-20 continued to be 18%, while the government-run Kesco has curtailed it to 15%. UPPCL is earning a profit of 4 paisa per unit from Kesco, but while selling power to Torrent, it is registering a 94 paisa loss per unit. Besides, Kesco has invested Rs 985 crore in the past decade to improve its infrastructure, while Torrent claims to have spent Rs 1,200 crore, but still it has failed to improve the system. Under an agreement with UPPCL, Torrent was to invest only Rs 200 crore in the past 10 years. President of UP Rajya Upbhokta Parishad Avdhesh Kumar Verma in August had demanded an inquiry into the alleged poor performance by the private company. On his complaint, the energy minister had set up a high-level inquiry under the director, commercial, which by and large found most of the allegation substantive and asked for a third-party audit of Torrent. However, despite repeated reminders by the minister, neither the third party audit was conducted nor was any action taken. A senior officer recently transferred from the energy department told TOI that a lobby of officers and engineers at UPPCL has been trying to rush privatisation of discoms without analysing the pros and cons. Echoing similar sentiments, president of the Parishad has demanded a probe by the CBI to investigate why no third-party audit was conducted into the functioning of Torrent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/not-in-favour-of-hurried-privatisation-sharma/articleshow/81520740.cms||Subhash Mishra
---||Delhi||Delhi HC seeks reply from Centre on vax priority to mentally ill patients||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Monday sought a response from the Centre on a plea seeking to get priority Covid-19 vaccination for people suffering from mental illness. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh issued notice to the Centre, Central Mental Health Authority (CMHA) and National Expert Group of Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) and sought their responses, while listing the matter for further hearing on April 30. It acted on a PIL, which also sought to direct the authorities to frame policy to provide Covid-19 vaccination to homeless mentally-ill people and challenged the exclusion of mental illness from the list of specified comorbidities for determination of eligibility of citizens in the age group of 45 to 59 years. Petitioner advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal submitted, “By way of excluding mental illness from the list of specified comorbidities and further by way of providing benefit of the vaccination to those with disabilities having high support needs, respondents (authorities) have not only prohibited homeless mentally-ill people from availing the benefits of the vaccination, but have also created barriers for thousands of those having severe mental illness and having no disability certificate to get the vaccination,” the plea said. The petition said homeless people with severe mental illness have a higher risk of contracting Covid-19 infection due to the fact that they are unable to understand what is happening with them. “It is because of the said reason that the Indian Psychiatric Society has written two times to the respondents for inclusion of mental illness in the list of specified comorbidities, but to no avail,” it submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-reply-from-centre-on-vax-priority-to-mentally-ill-patients/articleshow/81519304.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Storm after the lull: Delhi stares at another phase of confrontation||NEW DELHI: The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 may reverse all improvements made in Centre-Delhi government relations. The Bill makes it necessary for Delhi government to obtain the opinion of the lieutenant governor before taking any executive action. After the Supreme Court judgment of July 2018, the elected government’s decision-making process had been speeded up because the state was only required to inform the LG about its decisions. That is why the ruling Aam Aadmi Party believes that the passage of the Bill will take the capital back to the days when the Centre versus Delhi government confrontation marred governance in Delhi. Read AlsoDelhi: NCT Bill in Lok Sabha to give LG more power, stage set for Centre-AAP faceoffCentre on Monday introduced a bill in the Lok Sabha seeking to give more powers to the lieutenant governor, specifying that any decision of the state cabinet or government would need his “opinion” before implementation. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said that the Centre's move was “unconstitutional andAAP believes that the Bill is designed to curtail the power of the elected government and vest more power in the LG, who represents the central government. Soon after the Bill was introduced in Parliament aiming to “promote harmonious relations between the legislature and the executive”, Delhi government reacted strongly, calling it “anti-constitutional, anti-democratic and dangerous”. Perceiving the Bill as intended at leaving the elected government “meaningless”, AAP is set to hit back hard and explore all remedies, having fought hard to protect its power after a famous electoral battle in 2015. The sustained battle over turf kept the capital in tenterhooks until the constitution bench of the Supreme Court held on July 4, 2018, that the LG was bound by the aid and advice of Delhi’s council of ministers and that the decisions of that council of ministers had to be communicated to the LG but the latter’s concurrence was not required. Read AlsoWill ensure smooth coordination, says BJPNew Delhi: Welcoming the introduction of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, in Parliament, Leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri on Monday said that it was a move in the right direction. In a statement, Bidhuri said the amendedThis verdict of the apex court almost put the controversy to rest because the concurrence of the LG was no longer required for administrative issues, except in the cases of decisions related to land, police and public order, which remained under the LG’s jurisdiction. Due to the power tussle, work had been delayed. These included the installation of CCTV cameras, opening of mohalla clinics, doorstep delivery of services, appointments of public prosecutors, doorstep delivery of ration and recruitment of teachers. The decision making sped up after the Supreme Court's judgment. According to sources, the Bill may cause similar delays in future if the two sides fight for power. The post-July 2018 period has been free of major rancour and relaxed the taut relation between the two power centres. The elected government has been able to work without tension with the bureaucrats too. In the wake of the GNCTD Amendment Bill 2021, ties may once more turn confrontational. The Bill states, “The expression ‘government’ referred to in any law to be made by the legislative assembly shall mean lieutenant governor.” The Bill also states, “…before taking any executive action in pursuance of the council of ministers or a minister ...under any law in force in the capital, the opinion of the lieutenant governor in terms of proviso to clause (4) of article 293AA of the Constitution shall be obtained on all such matters as may be specified, by a general or special order, by the lieutenant governor.” After July 2018, Delhi government has only been keeping the LG apprised of its decisions. But the Bill could once again make the LG the source of executive power in Delhi. Not surprisingly, the AAP government is aggressively accusing the Centre of trying to usurp power through the backdoor after losing the assembly elections in 2019. Governance and delivery are likely to be the victims of a face-off between the two power centres. AAP is unlikely to sit back and watch. It may prepare a strong case in its favour by underlining the need of federal balance and the importance of independence in decision-making by an elected government to enable such a government to take decisions for the welfare of the citizens to whom it is answerable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/storm-after-the-lull-delhi-stares-at-another-phase-of-confrontation/articleshow/81519298.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses termination of 13-year-old’s 33-week pregnancy in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Monday declined permission for the medical termination of the nearly 33-week pregnancy of a 13-year-old girl after a J J Hospital panel said it will result in the birth of a preterm child. “You’ve come so late,” said a bench of Justices Amjad Sayed and Madhav Jamdar who heard a petition by her father seeking high court’s permission to terminate her pregnancy as the law does not permit medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) beyond 20 weeks. His petition said an acquaintance offered religious cure for his older son’s epilepsy. Thereafter, he visited their home and even stalked the minor. Seven months ago, when he found her alone, he raped her after threatening her, including harm to her brother who was “cured by his grace”. He repeated the act after 2-3 days. The Class VII student’s mother mistook her bloated stomach for flatulence. On February 23, an FIR was lodged against the accused under IPC and Pocso sections and the next day she was detected 30 weeks pregnant. On March 1, the Child Welfare Committee sent her to a home. The HC-appointed medical board said there is no abnormality in the foetus or the minor mother. Since it is an advanced pregnancy, the risk to the mother remains the same whether it is terminated now or carried to full term. “Termination of pregnancy at this stage will result in a preterm viable baby requiring intensive care management and the mother will be required to be present with the baby in the hospital... Hence, it is advisable to continue the pregnancy and to terminate the pregnancy at term as the outcome of the baby will be better then,” its report concluded. The father’s advocate Ashley Cusher said, “It will be a child giving birth to a child”. Government pleader Poornima Kantharia said the report states that at “32.4 weeks which is almost 33rd week” the pregnancy is very advanced. “It is in the interest of the child and the mother as everything is analysed minutely,” she added. Justice Sayed said, “The report does not say it is injurious to the health of the minor.” The judges kept the matter after two weeks to take an update and pass further directions if required.

They made a rangoli around the pothole that has formed on the newly constructed cement concrete (CC) road. Locals shot videos and photos of the protest that went viral on social media.  Earlier in the week, locals shot videos with a scooter’s front wheel stuck in a hole that was created due to a small portion of road caving in.  Mota Varachha is a developing area where new civic infrastructure projects and private construction projects are coming up . The existing population of the area is around 2.50 lakh. Majority of the residents use VIP Circle to Sudama Chowk Road and a CC road has been developed on the stretch for Rs 52 crore.  However, the residents are not happy since the CC road has developed cracks and potholes. Following the protest by locals, civic authorities started work to repair it.  “Not only tar road but potholes have come up on CC road as well. We wanted to bring it to the notice of people and top officials, hence we did a rangoli to highlight it,” said Vijay Mangukiya, a resident.  “The CC road was constructed around 20 days ago. We were happy that the area got a CC road that is durable and a better option in the type of roads. But in a short time, there are potholes and cracks,” said Naresh Virani, a resident. Meanwhile, Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) started work to repair the road and washed the rangoli with water. “The damaged road leads to accidents and recently a motorcycle rider got killed.

Fruit cultivation is concentrated in Anaimalai, which has 1,530 hectares under mango cultivation, and Sulthanpet that has 257 hectares under amla cultivation. The remaining areas spread across Annur, Karamadai, Thondamuthur and Kinathukidavu. More farmers started growing fruit trees encouraged by the good rain in 2019 and the pandemic situation, says mango farmer R Kanakaraj. “The lockdown, which began in the beginning of the mango harvest season, forced us to sell directly to customers, gated communities, resorts and the horticulture department, avoiding middlemen. Those contacts, along with good rain, gave farmers hope of a good harvest and good prices for fruits.” Schemes launched by the horticulture department also play a role, says deputy director Bhuvaneshwari. “There are many takers for schemes including giving saplings of mango, papaya and guava at 50% subsidy to farmers who have registered with us. We also visit farms when they need help and also give biocontrol agents like Trichoderma viridi at subsidized cost.” Locally grown food is easier to assimilate, says nutritionist Rohini Sharma. “When you eat local fruits, you know they are fresh, have not been hoarded in cold storage, travelled a long distance and not artificially ripened.” Shriya Das, a fitness enthusiast and a naturopathy follower, finds the trend exciting. “I never consume fruits not grown in Coimbatore, including oranges and apples, because they don’t suit my tummy. I hope this leads to availability of more local fruits in uzhavar sandhais and supermarkets,” she adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/sweet-year-ahead-for-farmers-as-fruit-cultivation-gains-ground/articleshow/81519348.cms||---

The NCM has raised concerns about Rizvi’s statements in the media on his plea in the Supreme Court (SC) for deletion of 26 Quranic verses and has called it a “well thought conspiracy to disturb communal harmony.” The notice signed by joint secretary, Central government, Daniel E Richards, states that failing Rizvi’s apology within the stipulated time, the NCM will hold a hearing under Section 9 of the NCM Act of 1992 and take appropriate legal action. The notice comes after NCM received complaints about Rizvi’s statements and concluded after examination that the statements were “provocative, malicious, against the national interest and creating animosity between different sects of Muslims and against rights of religious freedom guaranteed under the Constitution of India.” This, NCM states, violates Section 153 A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) relating to wanton vilification or attacks upon religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc, of any particular group or class or upon founders and prophets of a religion. It also takes into account Section 295 A of the IPC pertaining to deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. Condemning Rizvi, the commission called the statement “prejudicial to national interest and with the intent to outage religious feelings by insulting a particular religion.” Rizvi has recently approached the SC with a petition seeking deletion of 26 verses of the Quran which he has claimed are of “violent nature and not part of the original Quran, but added after the death of Prophet Mohammad.” Complaints to NCM were made by one Abdul Majid Nizami, Ali Raza Zaidi, Mohd Faizan Chaudhary and Maulana Syed Nazar Abbas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ncm-serves-notice-on-rizvi/articleshow/81520815.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Delhi||Batla House encounter: How cops turned the tables on terrorists||NEW DELHI: While climbing the stairs leading to L-18, Batla House, ACP Sanjeev Yadav heard gunshots and saw his wounded teammates, including inspector Mohan Chand Sharma, being brought down. It took him just a few seconds to understand what was unfolding inside the flat. There was no plan as such in place, recalled a team member. “We hadn’t gone to the crowded place inside Jamia Nagar for the fierce gunfight that broke out. The first team did not even have bulletproof vests. It was an unsaid protocol that we never went in that area wearing police gear to avoid confrontation,” he added. Among those who had entered the flat first was sub-inspector Dharmender wearing a formal shirt, tie and trousers. He was carrying a bag posing as an executive of a telecom company. When the barrage of bullets came, three of the seven cops got hit. Things changed when Yadav arrived at the scene. He, inspector Rahul and head constable Rajvir barged into the room on the left side of the flat while facing gunfire. The ACP returned fire bringing down Chhota Sajid. “When we again tried to enter the room, Rajbir was hit on his bulletproof vest twice. Moving further, we found Mohammed Saif in the bathroom. He was unarmed and screamed that he was ready to surrender. He was brought out unharmed,” Yadav, now a DCP in Special Cell, said. In the melee, Ariz Khan, who was sentenced to death by a court on Monday, managed to escape. Within weeks, he reached Nepal where he managed to get citizenship and a passport in the name of Mohammed Salim. He stayed in Palpa, Kapilavastu and Gorkha areas, where he first started a dhaba, but later began to teach in small schools. He also made a brief visit to Saudi Arabia on the instructions of the Bhatkal brothers, who headed Indian Mujahideen and were based in Karachi. While police remained entangled in inquiries, commissions and politically motivated controversies, catching Khan became important for the real story to be proved in the court of law. In January 2018, DCP Pramod Kushwaha’s team received crucial inputs regarding Khan’s whereabouts from arrested IM ideologue Tauqeer. A team comprising inspectors Chandrika, Satish Rana and others then tracked Khan down after a month-long operation in Nepal. Incidentally, the same team got assigned under Yadav and pursued the case for three years, which led to conviction and capital punishment. The verdict is good news for every policeman associated with the encounter. “For years, we lived with all sorts of theories. But we had faith in the judiciary. We stand vindicated today,” Yadav told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-cops-turned-the-tables-on-terrorists/articleshow/81519365.cms||Raj Shekhar

The accused, 30-year-old Sanjay Mahor, was arrested once earlier from another hospital in the same district in December 2019 after he had performed postmortems, even prepared reports of medico legal cases, and examined hundreds of patients over a six-month period. He was given bail by the HC two weeks ago, but promptly went back to what he knows best. On Sunday, he went into the gynaecology ward and started examining patients’ medical documents. One of the nurses felt his behavior was suspicious and she informed hospital authorities, who called the police. During interrogation, Sanjay said he had tried to crack the medical entrance several times after Class XII but his childhood dream of becoming a doctor was “shattered by the Vyapam scam”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/school-passout-caught-posing-as-doc-in-gynaecology-ward-in-mps-morena/articleshow/81521970.cms||P Naveen

Increasing stress has worsened mental health. But it should be remembered that the country has faced many such tragedies before which led to major upheaval. But the world did not stop. “It stood firm once again. Life will be happier if you have the emotional intelligence (EI) to accept the situation and think wisely rather than just getting disturbed due to it,” said emotional intelligence expert Milind Apte. CP and Berar ES College, Nagpur and Mahila Mahavidyalaya, Amravati jointly organized a national webinar on ‘Emotional Intelligence — An Essential Soft Skill for Organizational Behaviour' on Tuesday. The webinar was attended by students, professors and people from Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and other states. EI expert Milind Apte, while scientifically explaining emotions, intelligence and emotional intelligence, explained its importance in his life with appropriate examples. “Emotions are present in everyone. But those who make decisions by controlling them are emotionally intelligent,” he said. Apte added that a person who decides to solve his problem with respect for his feelings and appreciates the feelings of others has greater emotional quotient. “Success in life depends 20% on academic intelligence and 80% on emotional intelligence. People who take less stress have higher EI. Men's emotional intelligence is observed to be better than women's," he said. During the question and answer session, he resolved the doubts of many. The principal of CP and Berar ES College Dr Milind Barhate said the pandemic had affected the mental health of many. This has increased irritability, stress. Milind Apte's information on how to overcome this emotional situation will benefit many, he added.

---||Delhi||Will ensure smooth coordination, says BJP||New Delhi: Welcoming the introduction of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, in Parliament, Leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri on Monday said that it was a move in the right direction.In a statement, Bidhuri said the amended legislation would lead to better governance in Delhi and clearly define the constitutional roles of the state government and the lieutenant governor in important matters pertaining to administration.“The Bill introduced in Parliament will go a long way to ensure that there is smooth and effective coordination between the elected government and the lieutenant governor, which in turn will bring efficiency in the administration and ultimately benefit the common man. It will clear the confusion in governance and in future fast track the process of development and decision making,’’ said Bidhuri, who is the MLA from Badarpur.Bidhuri said the proposed amendments clearly point out that the elected government needs to send legislative proposals to the LG in advance for his opinion and avoid any delays. “I thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah for taking such an important step in ironing out the issues to make the Delhi administration effective,” he added.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said the amendments would finally settle and clear the administrative works and powers of the central and Delhi governments. “The need to bring this Bill arose because between 2015 and 2019 the Arvind Kejriwal government constantly tried to encroach upon the administrative work areas and powers of the LG. The February 2019 directive of Supreme Court finally left no option for the Centre but to bring the present amendments,” he added in a statement.Harish Khurana, Delhi BJP spokesperson, said Kejriwal should show maturity and work in coordination with the lieutenant governor for smooth governance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/will-ensure-smooth-coordination-says-bjp/articleshow/81519391.cms||---
---||Pune||DGDE directs cantonments to finalise nominated members before Mar 19||Pune: The Directorate General of Defence Estates has directed all 56 cantonments, including Pune, Khadki and Dehu Road, to send names of nominated members before March 19. The elected bodies of the cantonment boards stand dissolved since February 10 following the lapse of their terms. Now, the cantonment boards are due for elections and the exercise for electoral roll revision is on. The same is expected to take five to six months to complete. Till then, a three-member panel consisting of cantonment board president, CEO and a nominated member will work as an ad hoc body. The nominated member will provide feedback and suggestions on behalf of cantonment residents regarding their problems and needs. “All three cantonments in Pune have received applications from aspiring candidates. They applicants have submitted their profiles and the work they have done in the cantonment areas over the years. Their names would be first shortlisted by the president of the cantonment board. These names would be forwarded to General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Southern Command for approval. Only those names recommended by the army commander, as per the procedure, will be sent to the Ministry of Defence for final approval,” said a senior official from the DGDE. Maximum of these applicants are either former board members or vice-presidents. Six from Pune, seven from Khadki and five from Dehu Road cantonment boards have submitted their applications with the respective president’s office. “As per the procedure, the president has discretionary powers to shortlist the names. Sometimes, he can send all the names, if he finds potential in all applicants. However, usually the final name is selected by the ministry politically,” added the official. This process is crucial for cantonments as the ministry would need at least a few months to declare the elections plans for these cantonments, said the sources. “Without the body, no cantonment board could function smoothly. The ministry has issued directive in this regard as it wants to complete the process at the earliest,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dgde-directs-cantonments-to-finalise-nominated-members-before-mar-19/articleshow/81519367.cms||Sandip Dighe

City Congress chief Bhai Jagtap met BMC chief Iqbal Chahal and asked him to relooktenders for STPs over high costs. Jagtap said that with companies bidding around 30% to 60% higher than BMC’s estimate, the cost of STPs had become unviable. “We are in favour of STPs. In fact, we told the municipal commissioner that the project must be fast-tracked. But they can’t give out the contracts at 30% to 60% above estimated cost. The commissioner assured us that an expert panel will scrutinise bids and take a call,” Jagtap said. The BMC’s plan to upgrade/rebuild completely the STPs is part of the Mumbai Sewage Disposal Project-II. “We have formed three committees with technical and financial experts...,” P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects) had said. “...The committee will study the technical proposals, do a complete cost analysis including rate analysis and then arrive at reasonable rates.” Jagtap said BMC was already paying a fine of around Rs 10 lakh a day for letting untreated sewage into the sea. “An NGT penalty of Rs 30 crore is already imposed. So the STP project must be fast-tracked to protect the oceans,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cong-hits-out-at-bmc-over-high-cost-of-sewage-plants-in-mumbai/articleshow/81520879.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

A total 309 people who had registered with the Goa State Pollution Control Board, participated in the hearing which was earlier deferred in January due to opposition. The board received 126 written objections and 1,871 representations supporting the project, stated the minutes of the public hearing. Among those who opposed the project included former Sakhali MLA Pratap Gauns A villager, Vithal Naik sought to know from North Goa district collector Ajit Roy why the company officials were seated next to the panel members of the public hearing as they are not authorised to do the so as per the environment impact assessment (EIA) notification. Roy said that the company officials were told to sit next to the panel as they would give a presentation on the project as per EIA notification. Vithal Naik, a local, said that the public hearing without awareness has no meaning, and urged the pollution board to act as an independent agency. A villager, Nilkant Gause, said, “The public hearing didn’t follow a democratic process. The state government cannot acquire comunidade land and Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) cannot allot this land to Vedanta.” Another villager Nilesh Naik pointed out that the locals were aggrieved over the expansion plans due to illegalities by the project proponents. He said that the expansion of the unit will be welcomed if locals are provided jobs, transportation and education. A number of people highlighted the pollution factor that will arise on account of the project. Shyamsundar Naik, a resident, said that since the unit has caused pollution since it was set up. Agricultural fields have been destroyed while the village is facing water shortage, he added.  Uday Pandurang Natekar said that numerous trees, including banana plantations, have died due to pollution caused by the existing plant’s operation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/at-public-hearing-villagers-oppose-amona-plant-plans/articleshow/81519368.cms||---
---||Delhi||Multi-modal hub at Alipur to boost travel link to Narela sub-city||NEW DELHI: With the aim of bringing much-needed connectivity to Narela sub-city, Delhi Development Authority (DDA) plans to create a multi-modal transit hub in the nearby Alipur. DDA has built thousands of flats in the sub-city but unlike Dwarka sub-city developed by the authority, Narela is a ghost town primarily due to absence of reliable public transport to ensure connectivity with the heart of the city. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) had proposed a 22-km-long corridor connecting Rithala to Narela as part of its Phase-IV project, which is yet to be approved by the central government. There are also plans to construct a more affordable ‘Metrolite’ or ‘MetroNeo’ corridor on the route instead. As the Rithala-Narela corridor is expected to provide much-needed connectivity to Narela sub-city, DDA will be partially funding the project. DDA now plans to create and facilitate a ‘transit hub’ that will connect the Metro or Metrolite corridor with other modes of transport like the existing Narela railway station and Narela bus terminal. National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) also plans to have a station in Alipur, which would be part of its proposed Delhi-Panipat Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridor. While work is going on in full swing at the Delhi-Meerut RRTS corridor and a large section of the Delhi-Alwar RRTS corridor has also been approved, the Delhi-Panipat corridor is yet to get a final nod. What DDA plans is a hub where even though the Delhi Metro and RRTS corridors might not come very close to each other at Alipur, interchange facility should be available in some way, apart from seamless connectivity with the railway station and bus terminal. DDA plans to integrate these four different modes of transport in such a way that passengers wouldn’t need to come out of the ‘hub’ and can change from one mode to another on foot. Apart from these modes of mass transit, there will also be provisions to accommodate and provide space to paratransit like autorickshaws and cabs and last-mile connectivity in the shape of e-rickshaws and other modes. In its budget presented last month, DDA had earmarked a sizeable component of its expenditure for the development of Narela sub-city. It has committed to provide Rs 1,000 crore in a phased manner for the proposed Rithala-Bawana-Narela corridor of Delhi Metro’s Phase-IV project and a provision of Rs 400 crore has been made in the present budget.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/multi-modal-hub-at-alipur-to-boost-travel-link-to-narela-sub-city/articleshow/81519407.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Disguised as train passengers when they mimic the low pitch sound of langur, they not only draw attention of passengers, but also alert the troop of monkeys who flee away immediately. The brothers were roped in last month and since then not a single case of monkey attack has been reported on the railway station premises. The troops of monkeys, too, are not seen frequently. #Lucknow: Aslam (29) and Rashid (27) mimicking langurs and produces sounds that can scare away monkeys.… https://t.co/hpuWqd0X3V— TOI Lucknow News (@TOILucknow) 1615861943000Hailing from Kalandar community, the brother duo has hired for a remuneration of Rs 15,000 per month by Lucknow division of Northern Railway along with three other men to control the monkey menace at railway stations of Lucknow, Faizabad, Ayodhya and Varanasi. “Every day from 8am to 8pm, we keep eye on monkey troops and ensure that not a single passenger is bothered or attacked by them for food. The task is tough but we manage it as we mimic sound of langur, especially male one. The macaque monkeys are afraid of langur,” said Rashid who owned a langur till last year, but had to give him up due to strict animal safety laws. “Since childhood our parents and other elders have only taught us monkey behaviour and mimicking their sound. We are illiterate and have no other means to earn following implementation of tougher rules of animal safety. Therefore the skills developed over the years while handling langur are our only means to survive,” said Aslam. “The railway has offered us six months contract to ensure monkey free railway station—and we are good at our job. We can ensure that no monkey will attack any passengers in our presence,” added the duo, who hail from Telibagh area. As per rough estimate, there are over 100 monkeys which roam around Charbagh railway station and nearby residential and commercial areas. They snatch food from vendors and passengers, storm into chambers of officers and damage CCTVs and electricity wires. At times, they also bite people. Jagtosh Shukla, senior divisional commercial manager, Lucknow division, told TOI: “The hiring a langur would have amounted to cruelty of animals, hence professional were hired to get rid of simian from railway stations of Lucknow, Ayodhya, Faizabad and Varanasi. They men have been hired for six months on contract and are being paid according to minimum wage rate.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/brother-duo-langur-mimicry-scares-away-simians-at-charbagh-station/articleshow/81520845.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Kolkata||Razing starts, Pragati Maidan PS makes way for Bypass Metro link||Kolkata: Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL), the implementing agency of the New Garia-Airport Metro corridor, on Monday started razing the Pragati Maidan police station to make way for the link. The old building had long been vacated and the offices were shifted to the new temporary structure that has been built by RVNL to house the police station. After the viaduct work is over, RVNL will build a new Pragati Maidan police station on the same spot and raze the temporary structure. “We have started demolishing the old building. Three piers and four spans covering 100m of viaduct gap will be filled up. The work will take around five months,” a senior RVNL engineer said. The police station opposite Science City-Parama Island on EM Bypass has come on the alignment of three Metro piers — 246, 247 and 248 — resulting in a 100m gap of the elevated viaduct. The Airport-New Garia Metro corridor’s Barun Sengupta station will come up near the police station. The temporary structure was built after identifying a plot next to the existing police station. “We have been trying to sort out the issue over the past few years and finally, the police station will be out of the way,” said an official of Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA), custodian of EM Bypass. The land for building the temporary structure was identified by KMDA. Several meetings have been held between KMDA, Kolkata Police and RVNL for nearly five years but it was only last year that a consensus could be arrived at. RVNL had earlier contemplated temporarily shifting of the police station to the ground floor of the station premises. The idea was shelved. “After the old building is pulled down and the piers constructed, we will build the permanent police station to the south of the existing one, near the Energy Education Park,” an RVNL engineer said. The cost of building the permanent police station, along with the demolition expenses, will be borne by RVNL. State officials said the police station had been built months before the Metro alignment was notified in October 2011. Therefore, the onus was on Metro Railway to pull it down and rebuild a new one. The New Garia-Airport line is one of the Metro corridors announced by Mamata Banerjee when she was the railway minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/razing-starts-pragati-maidan-ps-makes-way-for-bypass-metro-link/articleshow/81517956.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Kumar was at the Karwar naval base on March 13 and 14 and also went aboard the INS Vikramaditya to take stock of the Sword Arm of the Indian Navy. During this maiden visit, Kumar reviewed operational preparedness of ships and units based at Karwar. He also reviewed the development of phase II-A of Project Seabird. Prior to that, Kumar was on a two-day visit to Goa where he interacted with officers, sailors and defence civilians at INS Hansa. Upon his arrival on March 11, the admiral was received by the Flag Officer Commanding Goa Naval Area Rear Admiral Philipose George Pynumootil and accorded a guard of honour. Meanwhile, as part of the recent ‘Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav’ launched by the jgovernment of India, various fishermen community interaction programmes were conducted in Goa by the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard. The objective was to strengthen the bond between coastal security agencies and fishermen who operate in the same environment. Activities like lectures on safety aspects, coastal security and the vital role of fishermen in supporting security agencies were conducted. While naval teams from Karnataka Naval Area visited the coastal villages of Karwar, the Goa Naval Area carried out interaction programmes with the fishermen community at Chapora and Chicolna villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/western-naval-chief-visits-goa-and-karwar-reviews-ops/articleshow/81519406.cms||---

In its proposal to the state government, it has submitted that the plan could be executed through the e-auction platforms of the National Informatics Centre (NIC) or a public sector bank. The five-member committee that had been appointed to select a consultant for marketing the SEZ land has now been tasked with overseeing the e-auction process. NIC and two other PSU banks have already given the GIDC a presentation on how the e-auction can be held. “The GIDC does not have its own e-auction platform. We have given the documents to see if their platforms can be designed as per the parameters required by us for the e-auction,” an official of the corporation said. The GIDC is paying a steep monthly instalment of close to Rs 4 crore to repay the Rs 200 crore short-term loan taken from the Oriental Bank of Commerce. It took the loan in May 2019 to pay back the SEZ promoters and reacquire 38.4 lakh sqm of land as part of an out-of-court settlement. Just the interest on the loan is Rs 1.1 crore per month. Last November, the GIDC had floated a tender to select a property consultant that could help auction land re-possessed from the SEZ promoters. However, not a single consultancy firm bid for the contract, prompting the corporation to abandon the process. The industries department had asked the GIDC to auction the SEZ land in December 2019, but bureaucratic delays and the Covid-19 pandemic delayed the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/industries-corp-seeks-to-e-auction-part-of-sez-land/articleshow/81519419.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Nehru Bridge being lifted by 50mm||AHMEDABAD: Nehru bridge has been closed for 45 days and it has already thrown traffic out of balance. Long traffic snarls can be witnessed on Sardar Bridge, Gandhi Bridge and Ellis Bridge — three important connections to the city’s nodal transport hub, agri-trading hubs and wholesale markets. The average traffic on the two bridges--Ellis Bridge and Sardar Bridge — is estimated to be around 8,000 to 9,000 passenger cars per hour in the last two days according to senior Ahmedabad municipal corporation officials. If you are getting curious about the 45-day repair work on Nehru Bridge, then its worth recalling the November 2019 repair work at Subhash Bridge. It is an intricate closely co-ordinated engineering operation which will be underway at Nehru Bridge. The entire 61-year-old bridge, weighing approximately 2,500 tonnes is being lifted by 50mm using 20-odd hydraulic jacks. Once raised, engineers will replace, 126 of the 144 rocker-cum-roller bearings of the bridge with specialised elastomeric bearings. The various expansion joints of the bridge will also be replaced using latest techniques. This is a rare instance of such intricate operations being carried out. The repair work will be completed within 45 days. Subhash Bridge underwent a similar operation but we could complete the process within 20 days. The foundation of Nehru Bridge was laid in 1956 by chief minister of Bombay province, Morarji Desai.

A year since, Kailas, became a mask seller, is now looking at a new business opportunity with only one thing in mind—to get his five-year-old daughter back to school again. “The school in Shaniwar Peth, where my daughter studied, dropped her name as I was unable to pay up the fees in August, last year. It has been almost a year since the first lockdown was announced in Pune and I can’t help but think of the way our lives have spiraled down. From earning between Rs 22,000 to Rs25,000 a month, I am now earning less than Rs 500 a day now. The last year has shown me how tough life can be, but has also taught me of ways to survive. My only aim at present is to ensure that this year my daughter gets admission in a school again. This has not let me to slow down and give up,”Autade, who continues to sell face masks now at a corner on Sinhagad Road said. Once the first lockdown was announced in the last week of March last year, Kailas’ cab business came to a halt. He then started selling vegetables for a few months. But, when the profits became thinner owing to a sudden surge in the number of vegetable vendors, he switched and took up the job of a mask seller. “The first time I felt I had hit rock bottom was when I got flogged by the cops for selling masks. The administration, last year, had given a relaxation in the curfew from 10am to 2pm. I remember, around 12.30pm, a group of police officers arrived and beat me with sticks for being outside. I couldn’t provide any explanation to them as they wouldn’t listen.” He said he didn’t have money to pay his daughter’s school fees and despite requests, the school didn’t listen and removed her name from the rolls. “I am planning to switch again to a different business, so that I can earn more money and get her admitted in a school. I am also looking to get her admitted under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. She would have been promoted to Standard II if her education had continued. Now, she will be losing one year, but it is better than not having an education at all,” he said. On being asked about his plans if the state government decided to announce another lockdown in wake of the recent spike in Covid-19 cases, Autade said he was scared. “If that happens, I will be forced to take extreme steps. My family will not be able to recover again. The government should think about people like us before planning lockdowns. Restrictions are okay and necessary too, but the lockdown isn’t the answer or an option. At present, I am only concentrating on getting my daughter admitted in school again and finding a new business as selling masks isn’t really helping,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cabbie-turned-mask-seller-looks-at-new-biz-option-to-send-daughter-to-school-again/articleshow/81519418.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Kolkata||PSU banks’ customers lose life’s savings to online fraud||KOLKATA: A spate of complaints from bank customers using internet banking facilities and specialized bank apps is flooding the police department. The complaints are mostly related to accounts with public sector lenders SBI and PNB. The problems are two types: one where they have been duped and the other where the fraudsters narrowly missed their targets. Already, more than a dozen complaints have been registered with the anti-bank fraud section at Lalbazar and the cyber cell of Bidhannagar police in the past two weeks. At least six such complaints are now under active investigation, claimed an officer. Take the example of Kalachand Karmakar (66) from Rajarhat, whose life-long earnings were kept in SBI. “About a month ago, Rs 2.5 lakh matured as a fixed deposit. Since then, I began receiving calls along with OTPs, asking me to transfer the money into further FDs, all of which they insisted were to be done over the phone. Feeling insecure after my children warned me not to fall for any such trap, I began avoiding taking calls. Last week, I found that the bank had transferred the money into fresh FDs without my permission. When my children raised the issue, they asked me to return two weeks later to sort matters. “Exactly two days later, I received a call. The caller gave my exact name, address and age. He asked me to register for Covid vaccination and duped me of Rs 1.4 lakh. Just a day earlier, I had removed Rs 1.1 lakh to another account, fearing that something might go wrong. That is the reason I could save that amount,” said Karmakar, whose daughter had installed an app of the bank during the pandemic to “run the daily expenses”. In another incident, a 64-year-old senior citizen in Dum Dum claimed to have lost Rs 50,000 hours after he had gone to his old bank UBI (now PNB) to enquire about his account. He had stopped getting updates after the banks merged. The complainant — Nirmal Roy — claimed that he had received a number of calls on January 10 and was told by the accused that his new debit card (issued in the name of the bank with which his old bank had merged) was being prepared. Not suspecting any foul play, Roy shared his bank details and ended up losing money, which was removed in the form of FDs. When contacted, sources in SBI said that it had received some complaints related to YONO app as well as netbanking but they claimed that unless customers shared OTP or some details, fraudsters would not be able to take away money. An official of the former UBI (now PNB) also pointed out that fraudsters are yet to siphon money from an account unless some information is shared. The former deputy chief secretary of SBI Staff Association, Ashok Mukherjee, alleged that people with hardly any idea of apps and internet have installed it. “The fraud is bound to happen. We in SBISA are really concerned about this,” he added. The cops said that while they were suspecting the usual Jamtara gangs, all cases “showed a clear local link”. “The gangs are gaining a lot of vital information. We are contacting the banks to know if there are any security breaches at their end. But this is a closely knit gang that can target a whole lot of customers at ease. We hope to make a breakthrough soon,” said an officer. During investigation, cops found that the accused had opened a current account in one particular case by creating records to show him as an official of the same bank. The accused made use of a fake memorandum and article of association (MoA), a fake board resolution and fake identity card for opening the account. The fraud came to light following an inquiry both by police and an internal inquiry by bank. The FDs were diverted to this current account and then divided into multiple accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/psu-banks-customers-lose-lifes-savings-to-online-fraud/articleshow/81517960.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji
---||Delhi||AAP targets Centre for letting air panel ordinance lapse||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi on Monday attacked the Centre for failing to legislate an ordinance that the government itself had promulgated to form the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region, thereby causing it to lapse and the body to cease to exist. Claiming that the ordinance was the only step the Centre had taken to tackle Delhi’s air pollution, she alleged that BJP was not serious about the crisis. “Delhi deals with pollution on an annual basis. There are two sources of this pollution — one emanates from within Delhi, and the other, from outside,” Atishi pointed out. “A TERI report mentioned around two years ago that about 60% of Delhi’s pollution came from outside. As soon as the stubble burning season begins, it becomes increasingly difficult to breathe,” she said, adding that Delhi government was constantly taking steps to control pollution in the city. “With providing 24x7 electricity, the dependency on generators reduces. We have drawn up a hugely progressive electric vehicle policy, are providing ample charging stations, subsidies and also shifting towards clean fuel,” the MLA said. Delhi is the only state in the country to completely shut down thermal power plants, she added. “We also have the Green Delhi application, which aims to control dust across the city.” An ordinance needs to be legislated into law within six weeks of a parliamentary session. This ordinance lapsed last Friday. Atishi said, “I would like to ask the central government, what is it doing to control the pollution that’s coming from states like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan? Why has the central government taken no step towards controlling or preventing this pollution? Why is Delhi being forced to live in pollution?” It’s only issuing constant directions, the Kalkaji MLA added. The commission was not even given any office space or staff, the MLA said. “This goes to show just how serious Centre is towards pollution,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-targets-centre-for-letting-air-panel-ordinance-lapse/articleshow/81519422.cms||---

In the power supply system of an electrified railway, a pantograph in contact with the overhead train line is used to send electricity to the main transformer of the electric train, thus providing power to the trains. An SER statement said, train service was disrupted due to breaking of pantograph of 02703 Howrah-Secunderabad Special at the Howrah yard at 8.45am on Monday. As a result, movement of trains over Up main line was affected from platforms 21 to 23. A tower car was sent to the site for repairing of the pantograph immediately and the train entangled was worked out by diesel traction up to Santragachi. Consequently, the following trains were cancelled or short-terminated. There was a temporary bunching of EMU locals heading towards Howrah. The Howrah-Secunderabad Special left the site at 11.34am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pantograph-breaks-train-services-disrupted/articleshow/81517964.cms||---

His counsel, Mihir Desai, said he was a student and the speech makes out no offence. A bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale asked the prosecution if he was cooperating with the probe. The prosecutor said he was. The matter was adjourned to March 22 after the prosecutor said if a coercive step was required to be taken it would follow rules and guidelines of issuing him a notice first, as the offence he was booked for of inflammatory speech attracted less than seven years’ imprisonment. Advocate Aniket Nikam for complainant Pradeep Gawade, secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, said his speech in Hindi must be heard in full to know why it was objectionable and he read out parts of it. Usmani a former Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) student leader, said the FIR at Swargate police station in Pune against him was “malicious”' and discloses no offence as alleged under section 153(A) of Indian Penal Code (an offence aimed at causing communal disharmony). The FIR alleges that Usmani and others were speakers at an event to commemorate the anniversary of the Battle of Koregaon Bhima at Swargate, Pune. It alleges that he made statements that “hurt sentiments of the informant’’. But Usmani said the FIR was “frivolous and baseless’’ and “on the basis of certain select statements taken out of context from the speech.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fir-frivolous-says-sharjeel-usmani-in-mumbai/articleshow/81518007.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Bengal assembly polls 2021: Election duty trouble for vehicle owners||KOLKATA: If you own a vehicle, it is advisable that you contact the local district election office at the earliest and submit an application, stating how your daily life would get affected if your car is requisitioned for election duty. However, there might be little concession for commercial vehicles, the poll manual states. The requisition process for vehicles for the added areas of Kolkata — in seats like Jadavpur, Behala East and Behala West, Tollygunge and Kasba — began on Monday and the exercise for buses and contract carriages had begun last week. The elections here are scheduled for April 10 and several of the requisitioned vehicles have been asked to leave Kolkata for Jangalmahal on March 26 to bring back a section of CAPF and police personnel to these places after polling ends there on March 27. Some vehicles will also be requisitioned for third phase polls in South 24 Parganas. While police duties see use of buses, EC officials prefer SUVs. The QRT duty officers, too, use SUVs. An election commission official assured vehicle owners of a fair hearing. “The cars will not be taken over if the problems stated are genuine. We are first taking over government and then, commercial vehicles. But we cannot fully exhaust the two options as more people depend on the public transport system than their cars. That way, the public transport system might fall flat. We have to rationally exhaust the first two options before going in for private vehicles,” he said, adding that the Lalbazar election cell is informed by the EC of the total number of vehicles required. Not everyone was pleased by police sanction. A senior bank official tried to convince Jadavpur traffic guard cops after they requisitioned the commercial vehicle she uses to commute to work. “On Monday, she challenged our authority. We told her the commercial vehicle’s ownership lies with a third person and not the bank. We spoke to the owner and recorded his statement for future reference,” said an officer. “I told them that this is Covid times and cases are rising in Kolkata. I have been provided this car by office and I am a frontline worker as well. But they refused to listen to my pleas,” said Koushiki Saha, the bank employee. According to the poll manual, government and commercial vehicles are supposed to be used for election work and private ones are to be left untouched. But the city’s dependence on commercial vehicles has apparently forced the election commission to “keep the option open for using a few private vehicles as a last resort”. However, with most offices still persisting with the work-from-home schedule and the education sector shut, this should not be an issue this time, claimed EC officials. Among those, SUVs would be of priority to be used to ferry observers, said a source. The official explained how to apply to free a private vehicle after being taken over for poll duty. Ïf your car is requisitioned for poll duty, one can apply to the district election officer or the election commission CEO, in case the vehicle taken over usually travels across districts, stating why it will be difficult for you to function without the vehicle. Alternatively, one can use the Suvidha app and apply for relief,” he explained. Himadri Ganguly of the West Bengal Contract Carriage Association pointed out that they had written to the CEO of Bengal EC, the chief secretary and the transport secretary asking for a hike in fares. “We now receive Rs 1,910 a day. We have asked for a revised amount of Rs 2,500 a day. For mini buses, we have asked for Rs 2,000 (up from Rs 1,580). Each bus worker’s wage should be raised from Rs 170 to Rs 250 a day,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/election-duty-trouble-for-vehicle-owners/articleshow/81517962.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The seizure was a part of a drive against illicit liquor launched following the order of additional chief secretary (excise) Sanjay R Bhoosreddy in view of the forthcoming panchayat elections. The carriers failed to produce valid documents or the transit permits of the liquor stock being transported from Himachal Pradesh, said excise inspector Sanjay Gupta. Four people were arrested and booked, said Gupta, adding that they were looking out for two other accused. The accused were identified as Simranjeet Singh (40) of Mohali, Paramjeet Singh (38) of Ambala City — both in Punjab — Lalit Kumar (50) from Bijnor in UP and Bechan Shah (50) of Chhatapur in Bihar’s Supaul district.

---||Delhi||Unending wait for AUD campus in southwest Delhi||NEW DELHI: In 2018, land in Ghuman Hera village in southwest Delhi was chosen to build a new campus for Ambedkar University Delhi (AUD). Nearly three years since, no development has taken place despite attempts by the varsity to get details. Now, the villagers have approached Delhi government and the AUD administration demanding that the campus be set up soon to “help the local population”. On March 26, 2018, the Directorate of Higher Education had found a piece of gram sabha land in Ghuman Hera and fixed a date for inspection with the SDM concerned to ascertain the feasibility of opening of the new campus. The university was directed to depute an official for inspection of the land on April 6, 2018 and submit a report. After the inspection, a committee was constituted by AUD to evaluate the feasibility and suitability of the Ghuman Hera site for opening the new campus. As suggested by the committee, the university requested the tehsildar of Kapashera on May 16, 2018 for detailed information, like village population, transport facilities, etc. After seeing no action, the varsity administration wrote to the Southwest district magistrate in September 2020 seeking details about the land allotment. AUD vice-chancellor Anu Singh Lather said, “We have received no communication from district officials so far. Despite regular reminders to the Kapashera SDM, the latest being on February 16 this year, there has been no development.” After writing to the authorities several times to start the process of setting up the new campus, Deepak Yadav, a resident of Jhuljhuli village, got a response on December 5, 2020 from the Kapashera tehsildar saying the matter was under process for obtaining the requisite data from different department and agencies. “We have been waiting for a long time for a higher education institution in our vicinity. We became hopeful after hearing about the new AUD campus, but no development has taken place. If a campus comes up here, then students of our village will benefit a lot. Local residents’ bodies have written to various authorities to speed up the process,” said Yadav. SDM Kapashera Mukesh Rajora told TOI, “There is some issue with another department, which is causing the delay.” AUD has campuses at Kashmere Gate, Karampura and Lodhi Road. New campuses are being set up at Rohini and Dheerpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unending-wait-for-aud-campus-in-sw-delhi/articleshow/81519433.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

The daily tally of 205 cases on Monday was thus an 85-day high. In absolute numbers, Ahmedabad ranked second only to Surat city, which recorded its one of the highest daily number of cases at 240. Analysis of the test positivity rate (TPR) – cases per 100 cases – shows that among the four major districts Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot, Rajkot ranked first at 4%, followed by Ahmedabad (3.6%), Vadodara (2.8%), and Surat (1.6%). Overall, the four districts recorded a 2.3% TPR compared to the state’s 1.9%. The rest of the state recorded a TPR of 1.2%. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that bed occupancy at private hospitals has crossed 450 for the first time in 2021. “If we analyse the cases this time and the earlier surges, we see that the number of patients going to the ICU is less. Mortality is very less, and recovery rate is at par. But it doesn’t mean that we can let our guard down. Please avoid going out in crowded places if not necessary,” he said. With Monday’s numbers, the number of active cases reached 4,787, which is the highest since the second week of December. Ahmedabad (909), Surat (1307), Vadodara (721) and Rajkot (287) account for 68% of the active cases in Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-passes-200-new-cases-after-83-days/articleshow/81521002.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Vax drive pointer to all-inclusive approach: Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said the vaccination drive against coronavirus is being carried out without any caste and class discrimination which is a pointer to the BJP’s resolve of ‘Sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas’. Speaking at the concluding session of the state BJP executive committee, Yogi exhorted the party functionaries to help the elderly in getting vaccinated, in line with the party’s motto of ‘Sewa hi sangathan’. “Party workers have worked tirelessly along with the state government during the pandemic but a lot needs to be done,” he said, adding that the executive committee could be the right forum to hammer out plans to reach out to migrants and inform them about the state government’s welfare measures, including Rs 2 lakh insurance cover. Reiterating that the image of the state has undergone a drastic change in the last four years of BJP rule, Yogi said: “Ensuring that no communal riot takes place in the state is an achievement on the part of the state government.” He stressed that party workers gave strength to the state government in carrying out various programmes. “The work done by the state government in the last four years needs to be taken to the grass roots,” he said, underscoring the need for strengthening the party at booth level and making people aware about the robust law and order situation. In a veiled attack on mafia-turned-politician and BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari, Yogi said criminals are taking refuge in other states to escape the wrath of the UP government. “This can happen only under BJP rule,” he said, adding that zero tolerance on criminalization of politics helped the state improve its position in terms of ‘ease of doing business’ in the last four years. Yogi hailed party functionaries as a source of strength in the implementation of policy decisions like job creation and ushering in economic development. “Today BJP workers can say that the party did not just make poll promises to the people but also turned them into reality,” he said, citing the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya. Hitting out at the opposition parties for raising false issues like “fake encounters” and misguiding farmers in the name of new farm laws, he said: “It is the duty of BJP workers to establish a dialogue with farmers and allay their apprehensions while exposing the opposition.” He also attacked the previous governments claiming that they were driven by caste and community appeasement while putting the welfare of farmers on the back burner. Yogi also appealed to party workers to reach out to traders and exhort them to register themselves under GST and get insurance cover of Rs 10 lakh from the state government. “We are working for every section of the society, including the youth,” Yogi said while highlighting Abhyuday scheme which envisages free coaching to students. He asked party workers to utilize social media proactively in spreading messages of the party and the government at the Centre and the state. “We have committees at 1.6 lakh booths. If all members of these committees retweet the message of PM Modi or that of the achievements of UP government, it would send out a very strong and positive message among the people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vax-drive-pointer-to-all-inclusive-approach-yogi/articleshow/81520887.cms||Pankaj Shah

On Monday, members of the All Gujarat Parents Association wrote to the state education department seeking continuation of online classes for schools. Their contention is that if children carry the virus home and infect vulnerable family such as those with co-morbidities and the elderly, things could get worse. The parents also pointed out that in Ahmedabad, unlike in Surat city, RT PCR and antigen tests are not being carried out at schools. President of the association, Naresh Shah, said “We have written to the state government and will make a representation to the state education department on Tuesday requesting continuation of online classes for schools.” State education secretary Vinod Rao said , “As of now, we have no instructions from the government to stop in-person classes. SOPs are to be followed at schools.” Education department officials added that schools are seeing about 50 per cent attendance. On colleges, principal secretary, higher and technical education Anju Sharma said, “In-person sessions at colleges are on for first year and third year students. Till now there are no instructions to discontinue this. Covid SOPs are to be followed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/parents-of-school-kids-worried-as-covid-19-cases-increase/articleshow/81521008.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Dakshineswar seeks police help to enforce Covid norms||Kolkata: The temple authorities at Dakshineswar have got in touch with police to enforce Covid norms among devotees. The steady rise in Covid cases country-wide and devotees’ reluctance to wear masks and maintain distance have been causing concern among temple authorities. Devotee count has gone up in recent weeks following the extension of the Metro route to Dakshineswar. “Several visitors are not willing to abide by basic Covid-19 protocols. When we ask them to do so, some flatly refuse as they don’t feel there is any virus threat to be worried about,” temple committee trustee and secretary Kushal Chowdhury said on Monday. Desperate to enforce the norms, the temple authorities have contacted police to streamline the system of allowing visitors to the main temple complex. “We can’t allow visitors to enter the temple complex without wearing masks. At this point when the number of devotees is increasing steadily, we need to be strict to save them from getting infected. We have noticed that it is only a section of visitors who are creating trouble. They are getting engaged in tussle with our security guards who often get outnumbered. At this point we have sought cooperation from police so that the recklessness among some visitors is controlled,” Chowdhury said. The temple committee trustee has asked security guards to keep masks ready and insist visitors to wear them before entering the temple. Amit Ghosh, a trader within the temple complex who sells flowers and sweets, said it was getting increasingly difficult for the temple committee to enforce the rules within the temple complex. “If I tell someone to wear the mask, they challenge me and question my authority to instruct them,” he said. According to temple committee sources, the footfall has increased to 12,000 a day after extension of Metro services. “The matter needs to get resolved with an active participation from the state health department. We will assist the temple committee in its endeavour to enforce Covid-19 protocols in the temple complex,” said Ajay Nanda, police commissioner of Barrackpore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dakshineswar-seeks-police-help-to-enforce-covid-norms/articleshow/81517995.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Chandigarh||SAD names Virsa Singh Valtoha from Khemkaran||AMARKOT: In a move perceived to be aimed at countering charges of nepotism, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday announced the name of two-time MLA Virsa Singh Valtoha as the party candidate from Khemkaran constituency for the 2022 assembly elections. This comes amid reports of his brother-in law and four-time MLA Adesh Partap Singh Kairon also staking claim to the ticket for this seat for his kin. While Kairon’s political secretary Gurmukh Singh Ghulla Baler claimed that Sukhbir’s sister Parneet Kaur would contest 2022 assembly elections from Khemkaran, the former did not take any calls despite repeated attempts. Ghulla said, "There are 11 months to go, the candidate can be replaced, only Parneet Kaur will contest from Khemkaran." The perceived contrary stance of Adesh’s team portends political rumblings within the party. Making the announcement during the Punjab Mange Jawab rally, Sukhbir heaped praise on Valtoha for keeping the party flag flying in the constituency despite "extreme repression unleashed by Congress". "Sukhbir’s announcement may be aimed at negating allegations of nepotism levelled by Akali rebels, but it is believed that the decision may have also been necessitated due to tough competition being posed by Congress and a possible scenario where every single seat will matter in next assembly elections," said a party source. Senior Akali leaders, including Ranjit Singh Brahampura, Sewa Singh Sekhwan, Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, Rattan Singh Ajnala, had parted ways with the party, blaming Sukhbir for giving plum posts, ministries and party tickets to his relatives. In the 2017 assembly elections, Adesh and Valtoha had lost to Congress party’s Harminder Singh Gill and Sukhpal Singh Bhullar, respectively. According to sources, Adesh had staked a claim to four seats in Tarn Taran, including the Khemkaran seat, and one seat from Amritsar district. This had evoked a sharp reaction from Valtoha who had been nurturing the Khemkaran assembly constituency and both had reacted on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sukhbir-announces-valtohas-name-from-khemkaran-for-2022-punjab-polls/articleshow/81519434.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Delhi||Delhi: Many schools make offline exams optional for IX and XI||NEW DELHI: Following protests by parents and students over CBSE’s directive on offline examinations, many schools have decided to provide the online option for classes IX and XI. The schools had earlier notified about conducting offline exams for these students, prompting many parents to point towards rising Covid cases in Delhi. Springdales School, Dhaula Kuan, where parents had refused to give consent to offline exams, is now holding the second-term examination online. “In view of the increasing number of Covid cases in the capital, it has been decided to hold the second-term examination of classes IX and XI in the online mode. The date sheet of online examinations will remain the same as that of offline examinations,” stated a circular sent to the parents. KR Mangalam World School, Greater Kailash, had asked students to appear for offline examinations even after taking the online tests. “It is optional now. The school has said it won’t deduct any marks for those who haven’t given the exam,” said a student. However, almost 90% of the parents in some schools have given consent for offline exams. Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said, “As per the CBSE circular, we will hold offline exams. I have already received more than 90% of the parents’ consent.” Some parents have started a petition on change.org to Union education ministry Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank requesting offline exams. “Offline exams for classes X and XII is a good thing because it should be evaluated properly. But why lives of students of classes IX and XI are being risked by schools,” stated the petition that has got 35,000 signatures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/many-schools-make-offline-exams-optional-for-ix-and-xi/articleshow/81519440.cms||---
---||Lucknow||BSP to go it alone in 2022 UP polls: Mayawati||LUCKNOW: BSP chief Mayawati on Monday declared that her party would not be entering into any alliance for the 2022 assembly polls in UP. The former UP chief minister, who had tied up with Samajwadi Party for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls but failed to win a significant number of seats, said that while she was able to transfer votes of her supporters en bloc to the partner party, the opposite was not true. Appealing to her party workers and candidates who are contesting elections in West Bengal, Kerala, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu to give their best and ensure that the BSP movement spreads in these states as well, Mayawati said that she had not tied up with any party for these states either. “Our vote is transferable but we do not benefit from an alliance. We give our votes to the other party but do not get their votes. Therefore, BSP will contest all seats in the 2022 assembly elections on its own and not leave any seat for anyone,” she said, reiterating the charge she had made against SP when she broke off the alliance after the poor show in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Speaking at an event to mark the 87th birth anniversary of BSP founder Kanshi Ram on Monday, Mayawati said that Kanshiram worked on the ideals of BR Ambedkar to uplift dalits, backwards, Muslims and other religious minorities. After his death, BSP is the only party which is working to fulfil his dreams. “Under the current BJP government in UP, people are witnessing poor law and order while it is also clear that most of the encounters and use of bulldozers (to raze property of alleged criminals) are a result of the government’s casteist and biased policies. Development is also mostly on paper or in the media but nothing can be seen on ground,” she said. The BSP chief said that governments were coming up with new laws each day to harass the common people and the Centre’s farm laws were an example of this. She said that farmers had been protesting against these laws for weeks and BSP had been continuously demanding that these be withdrawn since the stakeholders, the farmers, were against them. “The government should provide financial assistance to families of those farmers who have died during the protests and to give a government job to one member of their families,” she said. Mayawati also questioned the rise in the prices of petrol, diesel, cooking gas and other essential commodities which were making the common people suffer, while on the other hand, the personal wealth of a handful of industrialists was skyrocketing, leading to questions over the government’s policies and intent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bsp-to-go-it-alone-in-2022-up-polls-maya/articleshow/81520930.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Until the late night announcement (10.17pm) by the GCA to hold matches without spectators, traders as well as restaurant industry stakeholders allegedly questioned the AMC decision to restrict timings for commercial activities causing small businesses to suffer, when no action taken on the blatant violation of social distancing at the recently concluded cricket matches. “It is unfortunate that local authorities are turning a blind eye towards swelling crowds with no social distancing or masks at cricket matches being held in the city, and yet imposing restrictions on small traders. AMC must clarify its stand and policy on Covid-19 control, and the rules must be applicable equally to all businesses, restaurants, traders and events of a larger scale,” said Jayendra Tanna, president, Gujarat Traders’ Federation (GTF). At 10.17pm, GCA vice-president, Dhanraj Nathwani, announced that T20 International Cricket matches on March 16, 18 and 20, will be played without spectators at Narendra Modi Stadium, due to rising Covid-19 cases. Restaurants have the same concerns, as they will be compelled to restrict guest entry till 9pm as they will have to shut by 10pm. With Navrangpura, Jodhpur, Thaltej, Bodakdev and Gota wards included under restrictions, restaurants and eateries at SG Road, 100 Feet Road, Judges Bungalow and Sindhu Bhavan Road will be forced to shut by 10pm. “Several small restaurateurs have raised the issue of inaction of the AMC towards blatant violations of social distancing at the cricket match on Sunday. If there were no restrictions there, why restrict restaurants and other businesses. The government must understand businesses have always been compliant despite facing losses and yet, their interests are not protected,” said Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA) – Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/why-target-small-businesses-not-matches/articleshow/81521001.cms||---

The seizure was a part of a drive against illicit liquor launched following the order of additional chief secretary (excise) Sanjay R Bhoosreddy in view of the forthcoming panchayat elections. The carriers failed to produce valid documents or the transit permits of the liquor stock being transported from Himachal Pradesh, said excise inspector Sanjay Gupta. Four people were arrested and booked, said Gupta, adding that they were looking out for two other accused. The accused were identified as Simranjeet Singh (40) of Mohali, Paramjeet Singh (38) of Ambala City — both in Punjab — Lalit Kumar (50) from Bijnor in UP and Bechan Shah (50) of Chhatapur in Bihar’s Supaul district.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Congress opposes Bill, says it will usurp power from people||NEW DELHI: The Delhi unit of Congress opposed the introduction of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on Monday, saying this would usurp power from the people of Delhi. The party will hold a dharna at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday against this ‘black bill’. Former MLA Anil Bhardwaj said that that the Bill would not only considerably dilute the powers of an elected Delhi government, which already does not have authority over land and police, but would also directly assault the powers of the citizens of Delhi to choose a government of their choice through the democratic process of elections. Bharadwaj alleged that if the Bill was enacted, BJP would resort to backseat driving through the lieutenant governor, regardless of the party that formed the government. This was because Delhi government would have to get the LG’s clearance for each and every administrative action, leaving the state government virtually redundant. He pointed out that according to the amendment Bill, Delhi government had to take the permission of the LG 15 days before any legislative decision and seven days prior to administrative decisions. Bharadwaj said Congress would oppose the Bill in Parliament, adding that party leader Rahul Gandhi’s tweet that ‘India is no longer a democratic country’ had been validated by the Bill. He accused the Kejriwal government of not raising its voice against the Bill though the Union cabinet had given the go-ahead for the legislation on February 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cong-opposes-bill-says-it-will-usurp-power-from-people/articleshow/81519445.cms||---
---||Lucknow||BJP committed to promise on common civil code: Rajnath||Lucknow: Defence Minister and Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh on Monday said like Ram Mandir, Article 370 and triple talaq, the BJP government is committed to fulfilling its promise on Uniform Civil Code. Speaking at the BJP’s state executive committee meet on Monday, Singh said: “Whenever we talked of Ram Mandir, people poked fun at us and said we did not have any other issue to talk about. We fulfilled that promise. We also fulfilled our promise on Article 370 and triple talaq. We will do what we have said about common civil code also." He clarified that the common civil code would not be against any faith or religion. “It will not be against Hindus, Muslims or Christians. Our politics is about humans and humanity,” he said. Common civil code or Uniform Civil Code calls for one law for the entire country in matters related to marriage, inheritance, divorce and adoption. It was a part of the BJP’s manifesto in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “If we don’t deliver on our promises it will lead to a trust deficit (vishwas ka sankat). The Ram Janmabhoomi movement brought a turnaround for the BJP because the party won people’s trust. They started believing that BJP could also form the government,” Singh said. “When Atalji was the president of Jan Sangh, nobody could imagine that we would form a government. We gave the slogan ‘chappa chappa bhajapa’ (BJP everywhere). Today that slogan has become a reality,” he added. Singh said the BJP won eight Vidhan Sabha seats in UP in 1980 and went on to form a majority government in 1991 under Kalyan Singh. “Jab dhancha gira tab bhi BJP ki sarkar thi aur jab Ram mandir ki shuruat hui tab bhi BJP ki sarkar hai (BJP was in power when demolition took place and Ram temple construction is also being done under BJP government),” he said. Claiming that BJP is different from any other political party, Singh said other parties fell apart over the years but BJP stood united even after coming a long way. “BJP is not only a crowd of workers but a ‘jeevant raajnaitik sangthan’ (vibrant political organisation). We are the biggest party in the country and I believe we are also the biggest in the world,” he said. Exhorting party workers to work hard, Singh said even if they did not get a ‘pad’ (position), they would certainly have ‘pratishtha’ (respect). Highlighting the achievements of the Yogi Adityanath government, Singh said UP had given maximum, about 40 lakh houses, under PM Awas Yojana and the state increased the total irrigated land by 3.77 lakh hectare. “Bansagar project, which was stuck for long, started moving under the Yogi government. UP has performed very well on schemes like Saubhagya and Ujjwala. When the PM took up the broom and raised the issue of cleanliness, many in the party had doubts if it will help the party in elections. Today, WHO has said that Swachhta Abhiyan has changed the country’s health scenario,” he said. “In a recent meeting of QUAD, US President Joe Biden has also said that India is on the path of becoming a superpower,” he said. Singh added that during the coronavirus pandemic, the PM declared lockdown which was criticised by economists. “Ration and food was provided to all during lockdown. A senior Congress leader, who is a friend of mine, said only BJP could have done this,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-committed-to-promise-on-common-civil-code-rajnath/articleshow/81520973.cms||Neha Shukla

---||Hyderabad||Insurance killing: Doctors, witnesses helped solve case in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Doctors’ opinion about the post-mortem examination and the statements of witnesses played a key role in helping the Nalgonda police solve the sensational case of murder that was committed to claim insurance money. On March 9, Nalgonda police arrested five persons including the main accused, D Raju, 35, an insurance agent, for claiming insurance in the name of six people, of which five were killed by the accused and one was a natural death, faked as road accident. Raju, along with different associates, committed the murders during the past eight years in erstwhile Nalgonda district. The crime came to light when Raju and his associates killed a 42-year-old liquor shop worker, Koti Reddy of Kondrapole village, in Nalgonda district on February 24, and faked it as a road accident. After the incident was reported, Koti Reddy’s mother and other family members raised doubts over the involvement of his wife and her paramour. Subsequently, the forensic team collected empty liquor bottles near the crime scene and the investigation officer wrote to the team of doctors from Miryalaguda government hospital, who performed the autopsy, requesting for a short opinion about the cause of death. As per the doctors, the cause of death was due to ‘asphyxia consequence to blunt injury chest and air way obstruction.’ To get a better understanding of the cause of death, the police then prepared a questionnaire, posing six questions to the medical team. As per the summary of the doctors’ responses, the victim’s ribs were fractured, lungs were collapsed, hemotherax was present and the injuries appeared to have caused death possibly by means of a blunt heavy force. The response of the medical team about the nature of injuries was ‘suggestive of assault. Road traffic accident cannot be ruled out.’ The response to the final query— ‘In the entire course of post-mortem, the possibilities of internal injuries are homicidal or not?’ was ‘May be homicide.’ Based on the response of the medical team and the statements of the witnesses who saw Raju and other accused meeting the victim and visiting his house, police altered the road accident case to a murder case and arrested the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/insurance-killing-doctors-witnesses-helped-solve-case/articleshow/81518005.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Goa||He worked tirelessly to realise his dream of a full-fledged campus for Goa Art College||PANAJI: Until the late 70s, Goa’s first and only art college was being run from a private house at Miramar, rented out by the government. In 1977, when famed Goan painter Laxman Pai joined as the college’s second principal (after the initial years under V K Patil), he was determined to give Goa College of Art the full-fledged campus it deserves. Not only that, the building should not be made of compartments, but should have a unique and spacious design, Pai insisted. “Actually I wanted to have this Goa College of Art next to Kala Academy, which is along the Mandovi. I always believed that visual art and performing art should be taught together and thus that was the ideal place. But, Pratapsingh Rane (Goa’s then CM) rejected this idea saying that it will make the place very congested,” Pai once said, recalling the establishment of the institute atop the Altinho hill. Pai’s stress on a structure of a different nature for the art college led to the government making an exception to norm of PWD constructing the building for the state-run institute. Architect Sarto Almeida designed the college building under some pressing instructions from the college’s principal. Many decades later, Pai recalled how he had proposed that the government make the area around the Goa College of Art at Altinho an educational hub. Though the state architecture college was also established nearby, his recommendation to shift the Goa Reserve Police out of the spot never materialised. But the outer structure of Goa College of Art is only part of Pai’s legacy. His unusual teaching methods gave birth to an entire crop of promising Goan artists, during his time at the college for little over a decade up to 1987. “The teacher should have a broad mind and they cannot be rigid and they should not impress their ideas on students,” Pai had said. He had also said, “There is no ideal teacher. A teacher should have the ability to be a student. When I was here (Goa College of Art), I learnt so many things from the students.” True enough, students recall Pai inviting them to discuss his own works, before they were exhibited for a show. “His teaching method was not like any other teacher. He did not interfere in your work. He gave us no lectures. But he would show his works to all the students and encourage a discourse over it with us on the choice of subject, the choice of colour,” recalls internationally renowned Goan painter and printmaker Hanuman Kambli. After college hours at the Savitri Niwas at Miramar, where the college was earlier located, Pai would pull out musical instrument he had learnt to play largely on his own. “He would sit there and play music. We would stay back to hear him play. He had also bought a recorder on which he taped himself playing the instruments, then he would play it while he painted, drawing inspiration from it. It was very inspirational situation for the students,” said Kambli. At the college annual day, too, Pai was the first to perform. To get Goa College of Art a premises of its own too, Pai is believed to have pulled one of his charms on the then Goa governor S K Banerji. Pai invited Banerji to see a large mural he had just made. When Banerji arrived at the rented Savitri Niwas, Pai found the opportune moment to push the case for a new premises for the institute. His students remember Pai not just as an ideal artist, but an ideal human being, who always reminded them, ‘you cannot suppress somebody and become great’. He retired as the principal of Goa College of Art in 1987, from the full-fledged spacious premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/he-worked-tirelessly-to-realise-his-dream-of-a-full-fledged-campus-for-goa-art-college/articleshow/81519465.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Chandigarh||Sukhbir Singh Badal proved SAD is family-run: BJP||CHANDIGARH: SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal’s announcement of him contesting the assembly elections-2021 from Jalalabad and Virsa Singh Valtoha from Khemkaran proves again that the party has no democratic set up and is driven by a family, BJP’s Punjab affairs in-charge and Rajya Sabha member Dushyant Gautam said on Monday. “We are a democratic party and it is the parliamentary board in the BJP which takes the final call about ticket distribution. But SAD is controlled by a single family,” he told TOI. The BJP leader said that as soon as the legislative assembly elections in West Bengal, Assam, Kerala and Tamil Nadu are over, the party would hold meetings in Punjab to finalise the strategy as well as contestants for the assembly polls scheduled early next year. The SAD broke its over two-decade old alliance with the BJP in September last year over the contentious issue of farm laws. Another senior party leader Harjit Singh Grewal said, “SAD is a party run by the father-son duo. It is for the people to decide whether they want prosperity of a family or the state.” He said the SAD president was taking such decisions in a hurry as he has realised that the party’s foundation was crumbling. Asked whether the Punjab BJP leaders were also campaigning in the West Bengal elections as the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) farmer leaders, including Balbir Singh Rajewal, have been opposing the BJP in West Bengal, Gautam said the party had mainly deputed leaders from the neighbouring states. On this issue, He added that the so-called farmers’ leaders were just fulfilling their political aspirations by firing from the farmers’ shoulders. BJP general secretary in Punjab, Jeevan Gupta said the party’s senior leadership addressing rallies in West Bengal has already been setting the record state and farm leaders would not be able to mislead the people there. “Even people across the country are now aware that these protests have become political in nature, just to oppose the BJP and weaken the central government,” he said. Gupta added that as soon as other political parties — SAD and Congress — started realising that the BJP would emerge as a strong party in Punjab and their leaders might switch over to the BJP, they started opposing the saffron party. The BJP in Punjab is already strengthening its organisational set up right up to the booth level and would contest the next assembly poll from all the 117 segments, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sukhbir-has-proved-again-sad-is-family-run-party-bjp/articleshow/81519439.cms||Sanjeev Verma
---||Ranchi||In 11 months, Koderma admin imposed Rs 18cr fine on 38 miners||KODERMA: The district administration has imposed a total fine of Rs 18 crore on 38 miners in the past 11 months as part of its ongoing drive to curb illegal mining activities. “A penalty of Rs 2.14 crore has already been collected from the owner of a vehicle which was involved in transportation of the illegally extracted minerals,” district mining officer Mihir Salkar said, adding, “The rest of the penalty amount will be realised soon. In case of non-payment, a case will be filed against the miners.” In the past 11 months, we seized 155 vehicles and lodged FIRs against 48 people,” Salkar said. Deputy commissioner Ramesh Gholap said the aforementioned action was taken based on specific complaints and after they received tip-offs regarding illegal mining activities, such as stone quarrying and mica extraction. “The administration recently sealed six mica godowns and a case was registered in the DC’s court, which ordered the auction of 914 tonnes of mica which was illegally stored in those godowns,” he added. As part of their drive, Gholap said that for the first time in Koderma, the mine areas were measured to assess the royalty theft which was going on unrestrained. In terms of the royalties earned in the current fiscal year, Salkar said that the department has received Rs 11 crore till now and the amount is expected to go up to Rs 17 crore in 2020-21 fiscal year. As part of its drive, the administration even conducted raids at Sirsirwa forest area where illegal stone excavation has been going on for many years. Sirsirwa falls in wildlife sanctuary area. “We had seized many machines and an FIR was lodged against 23 people there and a fine of Rs 14 crore was imposed. During our assessment, we found that around 3.25 lakh cubic meter stone was excavated from the wildlife sanctuary area,” Salkar said. “Our drive will continue till illegal mining is wiped out from the district completely,” Gholap said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/in-11-months-koderma-admin-imposed-rs-18cr-fine-on-38-miners/articleshow/81518651.cms||---

Their revival has been designated as a high priority area by the government,” Singhal told entrepreneurs, trade and industry bodies and industrialists from across the state, who had gathered at a hotel in Ranchi for the meet. “Besides revival of sick units, the department’s mega mandate, given by chief minister (Hemant Soren), will be to set up export promotion committees at the state and district levels,” she said. She also said that efforts were underway to make the department’s workings investor-friendly by repealing as many as 90 existing compliance procedures, spanning across 22 government departments. This was the second stakeholders’ meet over the draft of JIPP 2021, which is likely to be rolled out on April 1. The first consultation was held on March 6 in New Delhi in the presence of Soren. The new document, which will replace the 2016 policy, has emphasized on bolstering the MSME, pharmaceutical, food processing, tourism and textile sectors by promising capital subsidies in investments, tax rebates and monetary waivers. Entrepreneurs, who attended the meeting, praised the new policy and suggested an array of changes to make it tailor-made for various sectors. Manosh Ghosh, the president of Dumka Chamber of Commerce and Industries, flagged the lack of MSME units in Santhal Pargana owing to the unavailability of land and suggested that the government must build far more industrial parks to accommodate new units. The Jharkhand Small Industries Association advocated for bringing in a policy which will make it mandatory for the state’s industries to procure 50% of their total procurement from Jharkhand’s MSME units and a monitoring of the state single window system for timely issuance of clearances. Entrepreneurs from Dhanbad suggested that the government should attempt to bring in high power consumption-based industries in the command areas of Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) in order to tap the PSU’s low-cost power tariff. Jitendra Singh, the state industries director, said: “The suggestions which were put forth by the entrepreneurs will be incorporated in the new policy after consultations with the state finance and law departments.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/msme-revival-easing-compliance-burden-high-priority-areas-for-govt/articleshow/81518179.cms||Dhritiman Ray

In the latest incident, the victim identified as 40-year-old Menwa Devi died at her home in Hutpa village from the sadar block of the district.

The report recommended that action be taken against the contractor concerned “for misusing his authority in collecting toll tax from vehicles since it does not come under his jurisdiction”. The report was prepared by Dundung following a request on December 9, 2019 and on January 18 last year by the then RMC commissioner after it came to light that there had been a gross violation in allotting the tenders. The SP’s report suggested that a case be registered against the contractor of Khadgada bus stand under Sections 409,109,112,120 and sub-sections 29,31,32,35,46 and 49 of the Control of National Highways Act, 2002. Terming the allotment of Khadgada bus stand a direct violation of the SC guidelines, the report said that the apex court has clearly defined the status of a bus stand in its judgement in the Hari Om Gautam Vs Mathura district magistrate case. The decision states that any urban local body or district magistrate cannot allot the operations and management of a bus stand in a specific area. They can only identify a suitable place for the same. The allotment of tender also violates Section 117 of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 which mentions that only the state government or a competent authority can designate a place which can be used as a bus terminus. Dungdung’s report also stated that the recently allotted auto rickshaw stand at Kishori Yadav Chowk violates provisions of both Control of National Highways Act and Motor Vehicle Act. Dungdung also suggested that in order to resolve this issue, the RMC commissioner should conduct a meeting with the legal cell officials of the civic body and with traffic police. Upon contact, the assistant municipal commissioner and head of legal cell at RMC, Jyoti Kumar Singh, said, “I haven’t received the copy of the report and I will not be in a situation to comment unless I get the SP’s report.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/lens-on-civic-body-for-illegal-allotment-of-bus-auto-stands/articleshow/81520604.cms||Gaurav Pandey

SP (Ranchi rural) Naushad Alam said, “Even though a large number of people have been named in the FIR, we will make arrests only after having solid evidence.” Notably, Mubarak Khan, a resident of Maheshpur village, was tied to an electric pole and thrashed on charges of stealing bike tyres and batteries on the night intervening Saturday and Sunday at Sirka village under Angara police station. Khan succumbed to injuries before the police arrived. Earlier in the day, Alam handed over a sum of Rs 50,000, provided by the state police administration, to the widow of the deceased. Local women who were present at her house demanded more compensation and a job, saying the widow has two small children. The SP assured them to look into the matter. Alam also took part in the funeral procession of the deceased carrying his coffin for some distance. He later said, “As the family is in pain, we showed sympathy. In contrast to the tension prevailing on Sunday, the villagers were pacified today (Monday). We will take all measures to prevent untoward incidents.” It may be stated here that the Khan's family would be given Rs 20,000 under the family benefit scheme and Rs 2 lakh compensation by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/9-detained-in-lynching-case-widow-gets-rs-50k/articleshow/81520570.cms||---

Deputy commissioner Ramniwas Yadav said, “We are enrolling him in a pension scheme meant for the primitive tribe members while a job card has been provided along 50kg ration and Rs 5,000 cash for his immediate needs. Plans are afoot to provide him with a house under the housing scheme. A pond will also be provided for irrigation next month while his wife will be attached with a self-help group to help them earn their livelihood.” Yadav said that efforts are also on to trace a middleman identified as Rajesh Thakur, who took him to Delhi in March last year on the pretext of providing him with a job but later deserted him during the Covid-19 induced lockdown. “We will take action against the middleman,” the DC said. Berjom was also reportedly robbed of his belongings and cash while in Delhi. Without money, he was forced to walk back home along the rail tracks. It took him about seven months after he began walking last August to reach Sahebganj. When he reached Dhanbad on March 11, he was spotted by members of a local NGO, who arranged a bus for his further travel. He reached home on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/after-cms-prod-man-who-walked-home-gets-govt-aid/articleshow/81520537.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand CM tables scheme to reserve 75% pvt sector jobs in House||Ranchi: The state government on Monday formalized its plan to reserve 75% of jobs in the private sector for locals with chief minister Hemant Soren making an official announcement in this regard in the assembly. Setting a unique precedent, Soren addressed the lawmakers in the first half of the session and announced a few major policy decisions taken during the cabinet meeting on March 12. In a short speech, Soren said, “Since the house was in session, it would have been improper to make a public announcement of policy decisions outside the house. All such policy decisions were not included in Friday’s cabinet briefing. Abiding by the standards of parliamentary democracy, I decided to first inform the honorable members.” Apart from reserving 75% private sector jobs, the government has also decided to provide ex-gratia relief of Rs 1 lakh to family members of road accident victims. The CM said it was decided to treat accidental death as disaster and provision was made for payment of compensation on a proposal of home department. The government will also fulfill its poll promise of giving unemployment allowance to technically trained jobless youth. The labour employment and training department proposed paying Rs 5,000 annually to such youngsters to help them meet exigencies related to applying for jobs. Soren said finer modalities for the scheme will be finalized by the department and payment will be made through registrations in employment exchange. Similar regulations will also be finalized for factories, manufacturing sector and private establishments to ensure that three-fourth of all jobs under the salary of Rs 30,000 are provided to the locals. The government has decided to appoint a nodal officer for monitoring that the decision is being implemented. Meanwhile, the house witnessed a heated discussion over recent incidents of mob lynching. Vinod Singh (CPI-ML) moved a business adjournment motion seeking a special debate on the issue. Though the motion was rejected by the speaker, members of both ruling and opposition exchanged barbs. Singh said every possible measure must be taken to avert such killings while BJP’s Babulal Marandi accused the government of being toothless and docile. “If the speaker had allowed a discussion, a strong message would have gone to the administrative officials that mob lynching cannot be allowed in a civilized society,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-cm-tables-scheme-to-reserve-75-pvt-sector-jobs-in-house/articleshow/81518559.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Hundreds of para-teachers from Giridih, Ramgarh, Lohardaga, Deoghar and East Singhbhum districts held a meeting under the banner of Ekikrit Para Sikshak Sangharsh Morcha at a ground located 500 metres from the Vidhan Sabha. The agitation lasted for around six hours. The para-teachers claimed that the JMM-Congress-RJD coalition had assured them that it would regularise their services after coming to power, but the government has not fulfilled its promise even after completing nearly 400 days in office. A para-teacher, Cintu Singh, said, “The CM had promised to regularise our jobs within three months of coming to power. I wonder when will he fulfil his pledge.” Another agitator, Sanjay Dubey, said, “The government should take a decision by March 19 or else the para-teachers would be forced to stage a bigger agitation. “ Bagodar MLA Binod Singh, who visited the agitation site, said he has talked to the chief minister regarding the demands of the para-teachers. Para-teachers from different districts will take turns to agitate near the Vidhan Sabha from March 15 to 19. Notably, the education department had issued a directive to district education officers to ensure attendance of all para-teachers in schools. It had stated that teachers remaining absent from duty would not get wages and disciplinary action might also be taken against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/para-teachers-start-5-day-stir-for-job-regularisation/articleshow/81520498.cms||---

He added, “The dead birds were identified as Eurasian coot, a member of the Rallidae bird family. The carcasses have been sent for a post mortem.” This is the second incident of bird poaching in Jamukhari in the recent past. Earlier, the forest department found carcasses of 40 birds there. “We have set up an anti-poaching team and our crackdown on poachers will be strengthened further,” Singh said. Every year migratory birds flock to Jamukhari — which falls in the catchment area of Telaiya dam, an ‘Important Bird Area’ as per International Union for Conservation of Nature in 2017. However, according to locals, there has been a decline in the number of migratory birds visiting the dam recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/11-migratory-birds-found-dead-in-koderma-poisoning-suspected/articleshow/81520489.cms||---
