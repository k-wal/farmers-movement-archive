From Wednesday, Uber drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the minimum wage when driving with Uber. Eligible drivers will automatically be enrolled into a private pension plan with contributions from Uber alongside driver contributions and they will also be paid for holiday time. An Uber spokesperson told TOI the changes would only apply to the more than 70,000 drivers in the UK and would not apply to India or any other country since a “worker” is a classification that is unique under UK employment law. “Before Uber drivers in Britain were classified as self-employed, and now they have been reclassified as workers but not as employees,” the spokesperson said. Under UK law workers are not employees but are entitled to the minimum wage, currently an hourly rate of £8.72 (Rs 878) for people aged 25 and above, as well as holiday pay and a pension. Uber will not become their employer and will not be able to dictate drivers’ hours. Drivers will retain the flexibility to work when and where they want, as well as to work for multiple apps and firms. Agency workers in the UK are classified in this manner. Uber said it had consulted thousands of drivers over the last several weeks and that they said they wanted these additional benefits but without any loss of flexibility. Most Uber drivers earn far more than the UK minimum wage with those in London earning on average £17 (Rs 1,700) per hour and those in the rest of the UK earning on average £14 (Rs 1,400) per hour. Free insurance to cover sickness, injury and maternity and paternity payments have been in place for all drivers since 2018. The Supreme Court judgment handed down on 19 February found that Uber drivers worked under worker’s contracts. Uber argued that it acted solely as a technology provider and booking agent and the contract was between the driver and the passenger. But the Supreme Court found that drivers are in a position of subordination and dependency to Uber and Uber exercises significant control over the way in which drivers deliver their services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/uber-drivers-in-uk-to-get-pension-holiday-pay-and-be-guaranteed-rs-878-hourly-minimum-wage/articleshow/81556911.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Lone, on Wednesday, had driven to Baig’s home in Brein Nishat here along with several of his party leaders. Baig was peeved with PDP president Mehbooba Mufti after she could not give DDC ticket to Baig’s wife Safeena Baig from Sangrama in Baramulla. Safeena contested DDC elections as an Independent candidate and won the seat and even became the chairman in Baramulla. The Gupkar Alliance, of w Baig (74), a lawyer, begun his political career with the People’s Conference in the early 70s, with Sajad Lone’s father Abdul Gani Lone, who was assassinated. He then joined Mufti Mohammad Sayeed in 2000 and later joined his ministry as finance minister in 2002 when Mufti formed the erstwhile J&K state government with the support of Congress.hich Mehbooba Mufti is a part, chose Bashrat Bukhari as joint candidate from Sangrama. However, Bukhari lost DDC polls. Baig quit PDP in November 2020. A Padma Bhushan awardee, Baig said: “It gives me immense pleasure to be a part of the party which I joined as a youth and was groomed by Abdul Gani Lone sahib. Today I have the opportunity to groom leaders like Sajad Lone and others, who are taking up leadership roles.” Sajad Lone said the party looks up to Baig and believes that he has a big role to play at this juncture in helping the people of J&K to navigate the turbulent and treacherous times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/disgruntled-ex-pdp-leader-joins-lones-peoples-conference/articleshow/81556960.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Similarly, the charges for registration renewal of old bikes would be Rs 1,000 compared to the current fee of Rs 300. Obtaining a fitness renewal certificate for a 15 year plus bus or truck would be Rs 12,500, which is nearly 21 times higher than what is paid now. The road transport ministry has issued a draft notification proposing this hike, which is part of the overall plan to roll out the vehicle scrappage policy. According to the proposal, delay in renewing registration of private vehicles would attract Rs 300 to Rs 500 penalty per month while delay in renewal of fitness certificate for commercial vehicles would attract daily penalty of Rs 50.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); As the government has started announcing new proposals to phase out old polluting vehicles, questions are being raised whether the government will approach the NGT and Supreme Court to review the ban on 10 and 15 year old diesel and petrol vehicles in Delhi and its adjoining areas. “If the government is bringing a policy to phase out old polluting vehicles, then it should be uniform for the entire country. Therefore, there is a need for the government to go back to the SC and NGT seeking review of the order,” said consumer activist Anil Sood. It also remains to be seen whether the government would exempt the old vehicles running on electric and alternate fuel from this proposed hike. The increase in renewal of registration and fitness certificates is likely to discourage people from keeping their old vehicles. In the case of private vehicles, the owners need to get the RC renewed every five year after 15 years. Similarly, the fitness certificate renewal is mandatory every year once a commercial vehicle attains eight years. To create adequate facilities for scrapping vehicles that fail to pass the fitness test, the road transport ministry has also come out with a draft norm for setting up of registered vehicle scrapping centres. According to the proposal, the vehicle owner will be free to take the old vehicle to any scrapping centre in the country and he/ she can transfer the scrapping certificate to anyone to get any incentive for buying a new vehicle. It says the scrapping centre will have to verify the actual ownership of vehicles before accepting them for scrappage. “The scrap value that the company will give to the vehicle owner will be market driven. We will not set any price for this,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/from-october-shell-out-eight-times-higher-fee-for-renewal-of-rc-of-15-year-old-car/articleshow/81557666.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||India||Collegium split over selection of woman judge to Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court's five-member collegium headed by CJI S A Bobde failed to reach consensus over recommending Justice B V Nagarathna, a judge of Karnataka High Court, for appointment as judge of the SC as some said it would lead to supersession of many HC chief justices, who are far more senior than her. CJI Bobde and another judge had placed Justice Nagarathna's name for consideration before the collegium also comprising Justices N V Ramana, R F Nariman, U U Lalit and A M Khanwilkar with the hope that if she got through the process of scrutiny and the government appointed her, then she would go on to become the first woman CJI after retirement of Justice Surya Kant as CJI in February 2027. But some members of the collegium argued that recommending Justice Nagarathna's name, even in the women’s quota, would lead to supersession of several HC chief justices, including Justice Abhay S Oak (Karnataka) and two other senior judges from Karnataka — Justice L Narayana Swamy (present CJ of Himachal HC who belongs to the Scheduled Caste community) and Justice Ravi V Malimath (senior judge in Himachal Pradesh and belonging to OBC community). A few members of the collegium said if Justice Nagarathna's name was to be recommended for appointment as SC judge, then it should be along with that of Justice Oak. But both the names appeared to be breaching the balance in regional representation among SC judges, as observed by the apex court in its fourth judges case judgment in 2015, while striking down the National Judicial Appointments Commission. If Justice Nagarathna is appointed, there will be four judges from Karnataka in the SC. If Justice Oak's name is recommended, there will be five judges from Maharashtra. If the collegium recommends Justice Nagarathna, then it could also be accused of ignoring Justice Hima Kohli, the senior-most among women HC judges in the country and the present CJ of Telangana HC. Justice Kohli's parent HC is Delhi and her elevation would increase the number of judges from Delhi HC in the SC to four. The collegium members appear to have been caught in a Catch-22 situation and the sharp division in views over Justices Nagarathna and Oak seems to have pushed the discussion over other names to the background. The SC has five vacancies at present against the sanctioned strength of 34. With just a little over a month to go for CJI Bobde’s retirement on April 24, it is not clear whether there will be a collegium meeting again this week or next week to reach a consensus over some names so that the CJI does not retire without making any appointment to the SC. As per convention, the CJI writes to the government a month before his retirement for appointment of his successor and then refrains from holding any collegium meeting for selection of judges to the SC or HCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/collegium-split-over-selection-of-woman-judge-to-supreme-court/articleshow/81559084.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Magufuli, had not been seen in public since Feb. 27, sparking rumours that he had contracted Covid-19. Officials denied on March 12 that he had fallen ill. He was Tanzania's first president to die while in office. “Dear Tanzanians, it is sad to announce that today 17 March 2021 around 6 p.m. we lost our brave leader, President John Magufuli who died from heart illness at Mzena hospital in Dar es Salaam where he was getting treatment," the vice president said on state broadcaster TBC. She said burial arrangements were under way and announced 14 days of mourning and the flying of flags at half staff. Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa said on Friday that he had spoken to Magufuli, and blamed the narrative of the president's ailment on some "hateful" Tanzanians living abroad. Tundu Lissu, Magufuli's main rival in the October election when the president won a second five-year term, had suggested Tanzania's leader had been flown to Kenya for treatment for Covid-19 and then moved to India in a coma. After the death was announced, opposition leader Zitto Kabwe said he had spoken to Vice President Hassan to offer condolences for Magufuli's death. "The nation will remember him for his contribution to the development of our country," Kabwe said in a statement published on Twitter. According to Tanzania's Constitution, Vice President Hassan, 61, should assume the presidency for the remainder of the five-year term that Magufuli began serving last year after winning a second term. She would be the East African nation's first female president. Born in the semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar, Hassan studied economics in Britain, worked for the U.N.'s World Food Programme and then held various government posts prior to becoming Tanzania's first female vice president in 2015. Hassan said Magufuli was admitted on March 6 to Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute for heart problems and discharged the next day. A week later he felt bad and was rushed to Mzena hospital where he was getting treatment under supervision of doctors from the cardiac institute. 'THE BULLDOZER' Nicknamed "The Bulldozer" because of his reputation for pushing through policies despite opposition, Magufuli frustrated the World Health Organization (WHO) during the pandemic by playing down the threat from Covid-19, saying god and remedies such as steam inhalation would protect Tanzanians. The former chemistry teacher had mocked coronavirus tests, denounced vaccines as part of a Western conspiracy to take Africa's wealth, and opposed mask-wearing and social distancing. Tanzania stopped reporting coronavirus data in May last year when it had reported 509 cases and 21 deaths, according to the WHO, which has urged the government to be more transparent. He was re-elected for a second term in 2020, winning 84% of the vote in an election the opposition said was marred by irregularities and whose results it rejected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/tanzanias-president-john-magufuli-dead-at-61-vice-president-announces/articleshow/81560094.cms||---
---||India||3 crore ration cards sans Aadhaar link cancelled? Supreme Court seeks Centre’s response||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Centre to respond to allegations in a PIL that nearly three crore ration cards across states were cancelled because of non-seeding with Aadhaar and claimed that it was leading to starvation deaths in many states. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian was initially reluctant to entertain the PIL but later issued notice to the Centre when senior advocate Colin Gonsalves said lack of internet services led to non-seeding of ration cards with Aadhaar details in tribal and remote areas, which resulted in cancellation of ration cards, depriving the poor of their foodgrain quota under the public distribution system. Appearing for the Centre, additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi said the Centre was implementing the SC judgment in K Puttaswamy case on Aadhaar validity, which had directed the government that non-verification of ration cards with Aadhaar details would not lead to denial of ration to poor. He said the petitioner made a wrong statement before the court that ration cards were cancelled because of non-seeding of ration cards with Aadhaar details. The bench said it was issuing notice on the petition only because of the allegations that ration cards were cancelled because of non-seeding with Aadhaar. “If true, this is a serious issue,” the bench said. The petitioner said, “Insistence on Aadhaar and biometric authentication has led to cancellation of nearly three crore ration cards in the country according to the Union of India. The Union of India casually gives an explanation that these cancelled cards were bogus. The real reason is that the technological system based on iris identification, thumb prints, possession of Aadhaar, functioning of the internet in rural and remote areas etc led to largescale cancellation of ration cards without notice to the family concerned.” Terming the cancellation of ration cards of the poor as a cruel step, the petitioner said this has deprived millions of Indians living below the poverty line of food and led to starvation deaths in Jharkhand, UP, Odisha, Karnataka, MP, Maharashtra, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/3-crore-ration-cards-sans-aadhaar-link-cancelled-supreme-court-seeks-centres-response/articleshow/81560093.cms||---
---||Patna||Ethanol policy gets a thumbs up from industry bodies, farmers||PATNA: The approval of ethanol production promotion policy, 2021 by the state cabinet on Tuesday received a largely positive response from the trade and industry bodies as well as farmers of the state. Experts said the policy will help reduce pollution by promoting Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP). Ethanol is a renewable biofuel made from sugarcane molasses and biomass materials high in starch content. The state ethanol policy now allows the extraction of ethanol from surplus quantities of maize, which was limited only to sugarcane previously. Currently, the bioethanol blending in petrol in the country stands at 10%, and the government has set a target of 20% bioethanol blending of petrol by 2030. Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) procure ethanol from domestic sources at prices fixed by the government, which gives a boost to the sugarcane industry and will now benefit the maize farmers in the state. Ashok Kumar Ghosh, chairman of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board, said the use of EBP will help slow down the depletion of natural petroleum resources. "EBP will also help reduce vehicle emissions as it contains oxygen, which allows the engine to combust fuel better and reduce pollution." N K Thakur, vice-president of Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries (BCCI), claimed that the policy will be beneficial and give a major boost to Bihar's overall economy. "We believe that this policy has great potential for employment generation for people of the state. The surplus production of maize in Kosi and Seemanchal areas now will not be wasted and can be used effectively," he said. Abhishek Singh, general secretary of Bihar Entrepreneurs Association (BEA), said, "Other than employment generation, the policy puts forth a positive message that the state can make investor-friendly policy which was important for us as a developing state." However, others have voiced concern about the implementation of the policy, saying it will decide the fate of the industry. "The policy, if implemented successfully, will help in revival and generation of just one sector. The government should bring in all-around policies which will help a larger section of people and not just a few," said Bihar Industries Association (BIA) president Ram Lal Khaitan. Satyajit Singh, a leading industrialist in the state, said: "The government formulates various policies every year but its execution is never effective and most policies are credit linked back end policies. So, only more transparency in terms and details of the policy will decide it’s usability." Farmers, on the other hand, are hopeful with the new ethanol production promotion policy. Satyendra Kumar, a Riga-based farmer said, "Since the sugar mills have stopped operating, I started cultivating other crops to survive. I hope the government fulfils its promises and brings better days for the farmers."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ethanol-policy-gets-a-thumbs-up-from-industry-bodies-farmers/articleshow/81555646.cms||---

Around 100 stalls have been put up at the fair. In her inaugural speech, the deputy CM said an online portal would be launched on April 1 for selecting women entrepreneurs from across the state and training them. Organised twice a year, the fair helps new and young women entrepreneurs identify market opportunities for business growth and a strong customer base. “The main purpose of organising the Holi Mela is to give a platform to women entrepreneurs so that they can establish a strong network,” BMUS president Usha Jha said, adding that the number of stalls was less due to a paucity of space. A N College vice-principal Purnima Shekhar, Bihar Industries Association president Ram Lal Khetan and sugar cane industries department’s principal secretary N Vijayalakshmi also attended the inaugural event. While Purnima encouraged the women entrepreneurs to actively participate in the fair, Vijayalakshmi urged them to avail the benefits of different government schemes for the promotion of industries in the state. Khetan, on the other hand, congratulated the BMUS for organising the Holi Mela amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Geeta Gupta, one of the women who has set up a stall at the fair, waited for customers on Day 1. She told this reporter, “I am thankful to the BMUS for giving me an opportunity to sell my products here and earn profit.” Another stall owner, Varsha Mehta, said she had been participating in the fair since 1997. “The response from customers has always been great,” she claimed. Meanwhile, a large number of people, especially youngsters and women, thronged the Holi Mela on Wednesday. A regular visitor, Girish Chandra, said, “I make sure I come to the fair at least once every year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/100-stalls-put-up-at-five-day-holi-mela/articleshow/81555660.cms||---

Deputy CM-cum-finance minister Tarkishore Prasad moved the Appropriation Bill for the House to debate after which it was passed by voice amid a walkout by the opposition members. RJD member Lalit Kumar had moved the cut motion to mark the start of the debate. In his reply to the debate, Prasad referred to the claims made by the leader of opposition in the House Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on February 25 as part of his deliberation on the state’s budget for 2021-22, and also refuted his claims on several counts. Presenting a comparative picture, Tejashwi had said that NDA lawmakers have been chest-thumping on increasing the size of the budget from 2005-06 to 2021-22 fiscals, but the increase in the state budget from 1990 to 2005 under Lalu Yadav-Rabri Devi rule was 8 times, which has also been maintained by the NDA government led by CM Nitish Kumar in the past 15 years. To that, Prasad said, “The aim and objective of our (read NDA) government are to maximise the welfare of the people of the state. Therefore, we kept on increasing the budget size every year.” He also said the NDA government made quality plan expenditure with eyes on building and strengthening the state’s infrastructure through increased capital expenditure every year, besides taking other welfare steps for the benefit of the people. Citing figures, Prasad said at the time of separation of Jharkhand from Bihar, the state’s budget in 2000-01 was Rs 20,444 crore, which, however, could be increased to merely Rs 28,978 crore in 2005-06, even as the state’s budget in united Bihar and Jharkhand was Rs 3,000 crore in 1990-91. The overall increase was 7.54 times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rs2-2l-cr-appropriation-bill-passed/articleshow/81555585.cms||---
---||Business||P&G leverages shifts in habits||MUMBAI: Self-shave is a consumer habit that has stuck since the pandemic started, as also the shift from powder detergents to liquids. According to industry data, there has been a 30% increase in consumers opting to shave at home in the last one year. Additionally, 25% more consumers are now using liquid detergents compared to last year. Highlighting these changes in consumer behaviour, Procter & Gamble India CEO & MD Madhusudan Gopalan said there’s a noticeable shift towards self-shave. He expects both these trends to stay and, riding on these, P&G has made certain interventions to ensure consumers adapt well to the new behaviour. “We brought in certain constructive disruptions in the market. For instance, when we saw consumers adding a germ-kill additive in their washing powder, we introduced a germ-kill in the detergent itself. Then to ensure convenience, we introduced a three-bladed razor at one-third the cost to make it affordable for a ‘no-cuts’ feel. The uniqueness about this is that it is an India-specific innovation in Gillette,” Gopalan told TOI. At the premium end of the spectrum, Gopalan said since a lot of consumers were doing their own laundry at home, and several use washing machines, there is a noticeable shift towards the premium end of laundry, that is, liquids. P&G, which now has a presence in close to 7 million outlets across India, is also investing in direct reach in rural India. Rural is growing faster than urban for P&G and the company is using the strength of its entire portfolio of products to increase its reach. Products like Pampers at Rs 10, for instance, are being used to drive penetration of the category through affordability. “Rural consumers are looking for quality products. First-time users stick to a brand as long as it is affordable,” said Gopalan. Rural India’s contribution to the company’s business has increased to one-third from one-fourth earlier. The Rs 11,000-crore P&G India, which Gopalan oversees as MD, includes the listed entities Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health Care and Gillette India, and the unlisted Procter & Gamble Home Products.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pg-leverages-shifts-in-habits/articleshow/81557378.cms||Namrata Singh

Driven by strong retail demand, the offer was subscribed four times by the end of the day. Nazara, backed by billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, is raising Rs 583 crore through the IPO at a price of Rs 1,100-1,001 per share. According to bidding details on the BSE, the retail portion was subscribed nearly 17 times, while the non-institutional investor, also called the high net worth investor (HNI) part was subscribed about three times. The employee part was subscribed 2.3 times and the institutional part just about 40% or 0.4 time. As is the norm in most IPOs, most of the bids are expected to come on Friday, the last day of the offer. Its promoters and some of the existing shareholders are selling nearly 53 lakh shares in this public offer, the offer document showed. WestBridge Ventures, one of the early backers of the company, had exited its investments in January by selling its stake worth over Rs 500 crore to Plutus Wealth Management and its associates. Earlier in 2017, WestBridge had sold stakes to an arm of domestic financial services group IIFL and Jhunjhunwala, who will not be diluting his minority stake in Nazara through the IPO. This is the second attempt by the company to go public. In 2018, it had received Sebi’s nod to launch the IPO but it had not proceeded. The company is known for its games on World Cricket Championship, Chhota Bheem and Motu Patlu series. In FY20, Nazara had posted a net loss of Rs 26 crore from a total income of Rs 262 crore. With a surge in gaming during the pandemic, the company said it has already recorded income of around Rs 207 crore in the first half of FY21. At 39%, gamified early learning segment makes up the majority revenue share for Nazara, followed by e-sports at 32%. ICICI Securities, Nomura Financial Advisory, Jefferies India and IIFL Securities are managing the IPO. On the same day two more IPOs — Laxmi Organic and Craftsman Automation — closed with strong subscriptions figures. While Laxmi Organic IPO was subscribed nearly 107 times, CraftsMan Automation was subscribed nearly four times. Two other IPOs — Kalyan Jewellers and Surodaya Small Finance Bank — will close this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mobile-gaming-co-nazara-ipo-subscribed-nearly-4x/articleshow/81557321.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The report shows an alarming level of poor air quality in both cities as the average annual PM 2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns) was recorded above 55.5 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3), which comes under the ‘unhealthy’ category. Muzaffarpur ranked 28th with an average annual PM 2.5 level of 74.3ug/m3 last year (81.2 in 2019), while Patna stood at 32nd spot with 68.4 ug/m3 (82.1 in 2019) of PM 2.5 level. With PM2.5 levels of 54ug/m3 and 46.3 ug/m3, Hajipur and Gaya respectively ranked 68th and 135th in the world. Compared to 2019, the data shows a gradual improvement due to the Covid-19 lockdown for over four months starting mid-March. Muzaffarpur has also shown poor performance in the Ease of Living Index 2020, a government survey of cities across the country released on March 4. The city found itself at the bottom of the list when surveyed on 13 different categories, including quality of life, sustainability, health, education among other parameters. As per the report, Patna and Muzaffarpur did not record a single day in 2020 where the pollution level was at the World Health Organization standard. Muzaffarpur’s air quality in January 2020 turned entered the 'very unhealthy' category while in other months, it was in the 'unhealthy' zone and unhealthy for sensitive groups. Geological factors and anthropogenic (human) activities are the main reasons for the rise in air pollution in the state, said Ashok Ghosh, Bihar State Pollution Control Board chairman. "More then two-third parts of Bihar have alluvial soil, which was formed due to the formation of the Himalayas. The alluvial soil is soft and significantly contributes to wind-blown dust. Due to the meandering of the Ganga, a large portion of the river bed has now dry sand. When the wind blows from the Himalayas, the dust particles get deposited across the cities," he said. Ghosh told this newspaper that geological factors are not in control of BSPCB but by planting trees on river beds, PM 2.5 can be cut to some extent. Ghosh said open construction of roads and buildings, vehicular emission especially from outdated vehicles and cloud of dust by vehicles, and reduction in green cover because of development activities are the three main reasons for worsening of air quality. "We have written several letters to government departments for the use of screens during the construction but in vain. Using screen at construction sites can reduce pollution. Concrete pavements are important to control dust due to vehicle movement. Old vehicles need to be banned. Planting trees is also necessary to control air pollution," Ghosh said, adding that AQI consists not only of PM2.5 level but also other toxic gases, which always remain within limits in Muzaffarpur and Patna. The global cities ranking report is based on PM2.5 data from 106 countries measured by ground-based monitoring stations, mostly operated by government agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-muz-among-32-most-polluted-cities-across-world/articleshow/81555880.cms||Faryal Rumi

The regulator, however, allowed minor modifications and offer of an optional cover where the premium is shown separately. Irdai is also taking a closer look at pricing and has asked companies to get an actuarial review of the viability of every health plan at the end of the year to ensure that all health products are sustainable. According to Future Generali chief operating officer Shreeraj Deshpande, in terms of the circular, insurers should not add additional benefits or upgrade them in the existing health products if it would affect the premiums. “The additional benefits can be offered on an optional basis as add-on covers or optional covers with standalone pricing so that customers can take an informed decision,” said Deshpande. The regulator has said that the changes will enable policyholders to make an informed choice. Also, the appointed actuary must submit a report to the board at the end of every financial year on the viability of existing health insurance products along with the analysis of the experience with recommended corrective action. “Under the additional norms on modification of health products (including personal accident, or PA, and travel), Irdai has clarified that insurers can choose to add new benefits/upgrade existing benefits as an add-on cover with a standalone premium rate for it. Thus, providing customers an opportunity to enhance the coverage by opting for add-on covers according to their needs,” said Bajaj Allianz General Insurance MD & CEO Tapan Singhel. “Additionally, the regulator has also shared norms on presentation format of policy contract, which insurers need to follow for all health insurance products with effect from October 1, 2021. This will lead to further simplification and a better understanding of the policy for customers as the same format will be used across all insurers using plain and simple language,” he added. The new directive from the regulator comes at a time when several insurance companies have hiked health premiums during the pandemic. Many companies have cited regulations that compel them to provide wider cover than earlier on health insurance policies. This has not gone down well with the regulator. Irdai had pointed out at that time that the wider cover prescribed by the regulator would result in a premium increase of only 5%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/irdai-bars-widening-of-health-covers-if-premiums-increase/articleshow/81557402.cms||---

Reacting to the World Air Quality Report, which shows Delhi as one of the top polluted capital city in the world, Rai said nine cities in the top 10 include cities from Uttar Pradesh. Talking about the report, the minister said, “Delhi used to be polluted. But with reports stating that pollution has seen a fall of 15%, the condition is slowly improving.” Rai added that, under the leadership of the Arvind Kejriwal government, the city has seen reduced pollution and an increased green belt. “Delhi government has been working to bring about several policies, including fuel change, tree transplantation, electric vehicle and is installing smog guns in worse-affected areas. The government, in collaboration with Indian Agricultural Research Institute, made bio-decomposers to eliminate stubble burning, worked on war-footing to fight dust pollution and on Green Delhi app to help identify problem areas in the city. Delhi is the first in the country to shut down its power thermal plants,” he said. Targeting the Union government, Rai said the intention of the Centre was clear, which has done nothing to shut down brick kilns and polluting thermal power plants in the neighbouring states. “Only if governments begin to work to address air pollution, we can aim for a better future,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-efforts-help-cut-pollution-by-15-rai/articleshow/81557940.cms||---

It will be Tejashwi’s maiden election rally in Assam where the RJD is part of the Congress-led eight-party Grand Alliance. The RJD has fielded Hira Devi, a businesswoman from the Hindi-speaking community, as its candidate from the Tinsukia assembly seat. “Tejashwi will land at Assam’s Dibrugarh Airport around 9.30am on March 22 and travel to Tinsukia via road. He will reach there around 11.30 pm,” RJD’s Assam state president Shonarul Shah Mustafa told TOI over the phone on Wednesday. RJD’s Tinsukia unit president Mohan Sah said elaborate arrangements were being made to make Tejashwi’s first rally in Assam a grand success. Sah added, “Since a large number of people from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh reside in the town, Tinsukia is known as ‘mini Bihar’ in the north-eastern part of Assam. They are eager to listen to Tejashwi’s speech.” Hira Devi is locked in a direct contest with BJP’s sitting MLA Sanjoy Kishan, who is also Assam’s tea tribe welfare minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-to-address-rally-on-march-22/articleshow/81555657.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Visakhapatnam||Jump in new infections drives Covid resurgence across Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh may be staring at a second wave of Covid-19 with the state seeing a clear resurgence in the daily number of infections over the last two weeks. From a full-blown outbreak between late July and early September 2020 when the number of cases stood at an average of 9,000 a day, daily numbers posted a sustained drop till the last week of February, 2021. During the peak, the case positivity rate had shot up to as high as 17% in August last year before dipping to the lowest ever positivity rate of 0.2% this February. However, from 0.3% on March 9, the positivity rate steeply increased to 1.1% on March 16 for the first time in 100 days. According to health experts, this is in excess of normal expectancy despite no change in testing pattern. Anticipating an increase in numbers in the coming weeks, the health department is bracing for a further surge. Mirroring the spike in the daily numbers, tens of schoolchildren tested positive for the novel coronavirus disease in Chittoor, East Godavari, Visakhapatnam and other parts of the state in the last few days. According to health officials, the seven-day average growth rate can be used as an indicator to determine the early and imminent second wave. Speaking to TOI, AP Covid-19 nodal officer, Dr K Rambabu said that the health department has started tracing 10 primary and 10 secondary contacts for each Covid-19 case, considering the recent surge. “Based on the insights and lessons derived from the Covid-19 management in the last one year, the department is closely monitoring the evolving situation in the districts to pick up the early signs of resurgence. Districts like Chittoor, Visakhapatnam and Guntur have been recording relatively higher daily case numbers. The focus is also on intensive risk communication to limit the transmission chain. Instructions and advisories have been issued to officials in districts,” said Dr Rambabu. Andhra Pradesh is one of the few states to have been recently asked by the Union government to watch out for super-spreading events and adopt best practices to break the chain of transmission. Meanwhile, the vaccination drive has been gradually gaining momentum with nearly 75,000 people inoculated on Tuesday, totalling cumulative recipients of about 12.35 lakh. However, Covid-19 vaccine wastage stands at 11.6% in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/jump-in-new-infections-drives-covid-resurgence-across-ap/articleshow/81556128.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Kapri had been evading arrest since 2013 and carrying a reward of Rs50,000 on his head. He was also known as ‘Kulhari’ as once he had chopped off a person with an axe. This is the second encounter in the state within 24 hours. Four alleged Maoists were neutralized by the CRPF in the jungles of Maunbar under Dumaria police station area in Gaya on Tuesday evening. Three AK-47 assault rifles and one INSAS rifle were seized from their possession. ADG (operation) Sushil Mansingh Khopde said four members of the Kapri gang were also arrested from the encounter site. “Those arrested were identified as Jagmohan Mandal, Jaykant Mandal, Chandrika Mandal and Ganesh Mandal,” he said. Khopde said two regular rifles of .315 bore, two countrymade rifles, one double-barrel gun, one countrymade pistol and 63 live cartridges were recovered from their possession. STF sources said the Kapri gang was ruling the riverine area. “Irrespective of who sowed it, it was Kapri gang which reaped the crop in the riverine belt and sold in the market,” they said. Bhagalpur SSP Nitasha Guria said the encounter started around 6am and continued for almost two hours. “More than 70 rounds of fire were exchanged between the two sides after which both the criminals were neutralized. Earlier also, district police had tried to nab Kapri but he had managed to escape in the riverine belt. This time STF help was taken for conducting operations against him,” she said. Guria said eight cases of murder, loot and extortion were registered against Kapri and one against Mandal in Bhagalpur. “Kapri and his gang mostly operated in the riverine belt,” she said. The SSP said the policemen had to first cross the river by boat and cover several kilometres on foot. Ekchari police station SHO Mukesh Kumar said the last case against Kapri was of an extortion registered in June, 2020. “He had been evading arrest since 2013 and carried Rs50000 reward on his head,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/wanted-criminal-associate-gunned-down-in-bhagalpur/articleshow/81555562.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Delay in shifting top cop gave opposition upper hand’||MUMBAI: After CM Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday transferred police commissioner Parambir Singh, a senior bureaucrat told TOI that there had been delay in shifting Singh, resulting in Fadnavis “stealing the show” with his disclosures in the case in the state assembly. The bureaucrat said it appeared that both the CM and state home minister Anil Deshmukh (of the NCP) had not taken the disclosures as seriously as they should have, resulting in an embarrassment not only for Thackeray but also for NCP chief Sharad Pawar, the architect of the MVA government. Initially, Deshmukh, who has been blamed for inept handling of the situation, entrusted the probe to the state Anti-Terrorism Squad led by Jaijeet Singh. Later, after Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran’s body was found in a Thane creek, when Fadnavis made sensational disclosures about call data records pertaining to Waze and Hiran, which showed the two were in touch, the NIA stepped in and took over the probe into the explosives case. The Scorpio parked outside the Ambani residence had been in possession of Hiran. The ATS is probing the murder of Hiran, and Fadnavis has now demanded the NIA take over that case too as the two cases were linked. “During the entire episode, by and large, Deshmukh and the state home department appeared to be in the dark, while Fadnavis had the full details of the case,” the bureaucrat said. Nagrale said on taking over the reins of the commissioner’s post that Mumbai police were going through tough times and had suffered reputational damage, but he and the police force would work to restore the force’s reputation. The state home department had recommended Nagrale’s name as the new DGP in place of Subodh Jaiswal, who has taken up a Central deputation assignment. An IPS officer of the 1987 batch, Nagrale is set to retire on October 31, 2022. Anti-corruption director general Rajneesh Seth has been given additional charge as DGP, while Parambir Singh will be DG, home guards, in place of Sanjay Pande, who has been shifted to the Maharashtra State Security Corporation, which is also considered a side posting. Nagrale’s name came up unexpectedly for the city top cop’s post. In the corridors of power, it was believed that either Rajneesh Seth or former Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham would be the new Mumbai police chief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaidelay-in-shifting-top-cop-gave-oppn-upper-hand/articleshow/81557949.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

With the average bidding price at Rs 1,171, the government will mop up nearly Rs 5,400 crore from this divestment offer. The retail portion in the Tata Comm OFS was subscribed 1.4 times on Wednesday, the last day of the bidding, data on BSE showed. According to the contours of the deal, after selling 16.1% stake through the OFS, the government will sell the remaining 10% in Tata Comm to its current main promoter Tata Sons, which will see its stake rise to about 59% in the company. After the completion of the deal in its present form, Tata Comm will be the second listed Tata operating company in which the promoter will have the highest stake. Currently TCS, India’s largest software services provider, holds this crown with Tata Sons holding 72%. Tata observers said that Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran could take over as chairman of Tata Comm following the changes in shareholding structure. The last time a Tata Sons chairman was also the chairman of Tata Comm was in the early 2000s. Ratan Tata held that position at Tata Comm till April 2005. Tata Sons acquired Tata Comm (earlier known as VSNL) from the government in February 2002, beating Reliance’s offer. The divestment will clear the way for Tata Sons to manage Tata Comm’s affairs solely. In the past, the government was a stumbling block in Tata Comm’s equity fund-raising plans. The government didn’t want to dilute its equity, and so Tata Comm had to raise expensive debt to finance its growth initiatives, including M&As. It also restricted Tata Comm from investing in other Tata entities, specifically in Tata Teleservices. “With the government offloading its holding in Tata Communications, this may provide flexibility to the management on strategic decisions in future,” said RBSA Advisors MD Manish Kaneria. Tata Comm has been deleveraging its balance sheet and has lowered its net debt to Rs 8,000 crore from Rs 9,200 crore in fiscal 2020. The company is also likely to unlock value from its 756-acre land holdings after the government’s share-sale. The OFS will increase the public float of Tata Comm in the market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-stake-in-tata-comm-will-rise-to-59/articleshow/81557327.cms||Reeba Zachariah

After two days of isolated light thundershowers and lightning last week, the Patna Meteorological Centre on Wednesday predicted another spell of turbulent weather at a few places in the state around the weekend. Abhishek Prakash, an officer at the centre, said the temperature may rise over the next two to three days, but thunderclouds and lightning are also expected at a few places thereafter. The India Metrological Department (IMD) in its bulletin issued on Wednesday stated that thunderstorm along with lightning is likely at isolated places in Bihar on Saturday. Such thunderstorm activities in the summer months are known as Nor’wester activities, which are convective currents amid high temperature and moisture incursion leading to the formation of thunderclouds and lightning accompanied by gusty winds for short periods. The maximum temperature in most cities in Bihar is hovering around 35 degrees C. Prakash claimed that the maximum temperature in the state is likely to hover in the range of 34 to 36 degrees C, while the minimum will be in the range of 19-20 degrees C over the next to three days. In Patna, the maximum temperature was 34.2 degrees C, which was a notch higher than the corresponding normal. The minimum temperature in the capital was 19 degrees C, which was also a notch higher than the corresponding normal. The maximum at Bhagalpur was recorded at 35.1 degrees C, while it stood at 34.7 degrees C at Gaya. Weathermen also said that the sky is likely to remain hazy over the next two days due to the high level of suspended particulate matter in the lower atmosphere. "Northwesterly winds blowing at most places in the state from last 24 hours and dry weather from almost a week have led to suspended particulate matters in the sky, making it look hazy. Such condition is likely to prevail over next two to three days, wherein the temperature is likely to surge slightly," Abhishek said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/thunderclouds-lightning-likely-this-weekend/articleshow/81555648.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||No evidence of irregularities in Scania purchases: RTC inquiry||VIJAYAWADA: An internal inquiry conducted by Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) into allegations of corruption in Scania bus purchases has not found any procedural irregularities. The inquiry shows that the buses were purchased after four rounds of price negotiations. The then purchase committee gave its nod to the price quoted by Scania after it agreed to sell the buses at a price quoted by the lowest bidder. In April 2015, Scania offered a free trial operation of its multi-axle buses and introduced two buses, one each on the Vijayawada-Hyderabad and Vijayawada-Tirupati routes. The free trial continued for three months and in August, Scania made a representation to sell its buses at a price of Rs 1.01 crore. In the same month, APSRTC conducted a review on its existing fleet of AC premium services. After the review of Garuda and Garuda+ services, it was felt that 55 buses were needed to be replaced with new buses. However, later it was decided to procure only 45 buses. At that time, three vendors were supplying multi-axle buses. While buses of Volvo and Mercedes-Benz were already in use, APSRTC tested the performance of Scania buses during free trial operations. As APSRTC officials felt that the service of Mercedes-Benz was not up to their expectations, a decision was taken to call for limited tenders from Volvo and Scania in September 2015. Both companies submitted their bids and after opening of price bid, Volvo stood as L1 bidder by quoting Rs 97.75 lakh per bus. Scania quoted Rs 1.05 crore for each bus. After the opening of price bids, the negotiations committee held multiple rounds of negotiations with both companies. While Volvo agreed to sell its buses at Rs 97 lakh per bus, Scania agreed to sell at an almost equal price of Rs 97.28 lakh. The negotiations committee then recommended procurement of 30 Volvo buses and 15 Scania buses at the price agreed upon. Both companies supplied the buses and these have been in service since January 2016. Sources in APSRTC said that the process of procurement was conducted according to norms and no irregularities were found. The price was fixed after four rounds of negotiations and the buses were purchased at one of the lowest prices even if compared with the then market rates. As the procedures were duly followed, there is no evidence to suggest any loss to exchequer. However, if bribes were offered to individuals and these were accepted, unless Scania reveals the names with substantial evidence, there are no grounds to initiate any further action, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/no-evidence-of-irregularities-in-scania-purchases-rtc-inquiry/articleshow/81556298.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Talking to reporters about the meeting with PM Narendra Modi on the pandemic on Wednesday, Nitish, however, ruled out measures like closure of schools and colleges. “At the meeting with the PM, chief ministers of states reeling from a fresh spike made their statements. Fortunately, in Bihar the situation is not that bad,” he said. Nonetheless, it has been decided to increase the testing rate to around 70,000, as it had dipped to less than 50,000 samples per day in the state. The emphasis will be on RT-PCR, Nitish said. Nitish said he will hold a review meeting with senior officials and all the district magistrates on Saturday to check Covid-19 situation and preparedness in view of expected inflow of people during Holi from states with high infection rate. On Wednesday, 58 new Covid-19 cases were registered in Bihar. The CM said the state government was on alert and keeping vigil on people coming from other states and several people were being detected Covid-19 positive. However, he added the situation was under control in Bihar. “No, we see no reason now to order closure of schools and colleges. Of course, some restrictions have been placed on holding Holi Milan programmes because at such festive gatherings it becomes difficult to follow measures like wearing of masks and social distancing. That is not the case with educational institutions,” he said in reply to a query. Meanwhile, two Covid-19 positive people were detected during a random check in a train which had come from Punjab to Gaya and two other positive cases were detected in a bus near Sheohar. It was also coming from Punjab, health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit said. Total 58,385 doses of vaccines were administered on Wednesday. The beneficiaries included 38,829 senior citizens and 6,353 above 45 years with comorbidities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-rules-out-closure-of-schools/articleshow/81555547.cms||---

The old-timers said they had not seen or heard of any such incident before. Both the Speaker and the minister belong to the BJP. Sinha is an MLA and Samrat an MLC. The unsavoury incident occurred during the question hour around 11.30am. As it happened, asked by the Speaker, Samrat stood up to give reply to a question from BJP member Vinay Bihari. The Speaker intervened and told the minister that his department had not been complying with the demand to submit online the answers to questions to be replied and, in fact, had made online submission of only 11 answers against 16 questions for the day – just 69%. As per the practice, the assembly secretariat office downloads the answers to the questions at 9.30am. The minister said 14 of the required 16 answers had been sent to the assembly secretariat. “Vyakul nahin hoiye (don’t get unduly worked up over it),” he also told the Speaker, who asked him to withdraw the kind of words and the language the minister had used. This resulted in a spat, whereby the minister said, “This is not the way to give directions.” He also repeated thrice, “Don’t get unduly worked up.” As a result of the instant bad feeling the acrimonious exchange left on the Speaker, he stood up and adjourned the House. Shaken by the incident, the Speaker returned to his chamber, where he was soon joined by the legislature party leaders of all the parties, including parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary and rural development minister Shrawan Kumar. They tried to mollify him, but the Speaker, as sources said, kept on telling them, “I will not run the House. It has become difficult to run it. No, I will not do it.” He did not enter the House to take his seat after the adjournment time and asked senior member Narendra Narayan Yadav to preside in his place. Yadav took the chair at around 12.04pm and adjourned the House again till 2pm. In between, Samrat was also asked separately to apologise for the ugly spat on the floor of the House when it would meet again at 2pm. Incidentally, the House met at 2.07pm. With Sinha in the Speaker’s chair, Mahboob Alam from CPI(ML) raised the issue, whereby parliamentary affairs minister apologized profusely on behalf of the government and the treasury benches for the unseemly incident. For his part, Samrat, while addressing the Speaker, said it was not his desire to hurt anyone and if his words had hurt the feeling of anyone, “I express my regret and also apologise for it”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-assembly-witnesses-unprecedented-spat-between-speaker-and-minister/articleshow/81555500.cms||Abhay Singh

To roll out this pilot project, the transport department has initiated the bidding on Centre’s GEM portal to procure 20 CNG disabled-friendly buses Unlike any other bus, these special buses will have three doors for passengers- one in the front, middle and another in the rear. Of which, one door will be fitted with hydraulic lift which will make easier for PwD passengers to enter and get off from bus. Shyam Kishore, administrator of Bihar State Road Transport Corporation Ltd (BSRTC) said with the help of hydraulic lift, passengers using wheelchairs will be able to effortlessly get into or exit the new CNG buses for PwD. The buses will likely to roll out in city’s road by July, he said. "Using the hydraulic lift, passengers can enter the bus less than a minute. Each bus would have one wheelchair to help the passengers to board and de-board the bus. These special buses will provide additional space for passengers to park their wheelchairs while at the front row of the bus, two passengers on wheelchair can comfortably sit," Kishore told this newspaper on Wednesday. Each hydraulic lift can take a weight of up to 300 kilograms. Moreover, all CNG disabled- friendly buses will be equipped with panic buttons, closed circuit- television cameras, first-aid kit and GPS trackers. The BSRTC administrator said the panic button would help the PwD passengers to raise alarm if they face any health issues or emergency situation. "Initially, we will run 20 buses on 14 different routes in the city as the CNG stations are only available in Patna. The fare of CNG buses will be on par with the other CNG buses that is running in the city," Kishore said. He added: "Other passengers can also board the CNG disabled- friendly buses but the first priority will be for PwD commuters." Besides, the transport department would procure 50 more CNG buses to run in the city. Presently, 20 CNG buses are running in Patna including 10 fitted with CNG kit.

The boy died during treatment. Later, the accused, Vinod Pandit, buried his son Sonu Kumar’s body on the bank of river Kathara on the outskirts of his village to hide his crime. The matter came to light when Vinod’s wife Gudiya Devi approached Jhajha police station on Tuesday to lodge an FIR against her husband for killing their son. Jamui SP Pramod Kumar Mandal said Vinod had kept Gudiya captive inside their house so that she could not approach the police about the incident. “She managed to escape and told other villagers about her son’s death,” the SP said. He said the body was exhumed on Tuesday and sent for postmortem. Mandal said raids were on to nab Vinod, who was absconding. Jhajha police station SHO Srikant Kumar said a villager on March 12 complained to Vinod against his son. “The minor had damaged some of his pulse plants in the field,” he said. “In fit of rage, he started thrashing Sonu mercilessly. While thrashing, Sonu climbed up on an elevated platform made up of bamboo to save himself, but fell down,” he said. Kumar said Sonu remained under treatment almost for a day but died probably due to severe injury in any of his vital organs. He said the postmortem report is awaited to know what kind of internal injury actually resulted in Sonu’s death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-beats-son-to-death-on-villagers-complaint/articleshow/81555582.cms||---

Though the proposal dates to 2016, the file has been pending with forest department authorities. The location of the Kanaka Durga temple on Indrakeeladri hilltop, which falls under a reserve forest, has stalled widening of the ghat road.Following a landslide on the ghat road in Dasara 2020, the government sanctioned funds to the temple and directed the trust board to take up works to prevent similar incidents. The temple authorities had explained they could not do so due to restrictions on forest land and urged the government to transfer the land to the endowments department. District collector A Md Imtiaz conducted a meeting with the endowments and forest departments and enquired about the file’s status. The forest department submitted that the land survey is complete and they will initiate the process to facilitate land transfer. Welcoming the move, trust board chairman Paila Sominaidu said, “Transferring forest land to the temple will remove obstacles to complete the ghat road strengthening works.” — Venu Lanka||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/durga-temple-to-get-127-acres-of-forest-land/articleshow/81556322.cms||Venu Lanka

Since the project is expected to cost Rs 249 crore, the state government has decided to take clearance from the judicial preview committee headed by former high court judge Justice Siva Sankara Rao. The social welfare department, the nodal agency to implement the project, has handed it over to the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) to execute the project. In turn, the APIIC had the tender documents readied and submitted to the judicial preview committee on Wednesday. “We have submitted tender documents for judicial preview to ensure transparency in the execution,” said APIIC managing director Raveen Kumar Reddy. He said that the public, including the contractor firms, could file their objections or suggestions about the tender conditions with the judicial preview committee which will take the final call on all such inputs. A 125-feet-tall bronze statue of Dr Ambedkar will be installed at PWD grounds (Swaraj Maidan) as part of the project. The decision to install the statue was taken by chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy as a tribute to the father of the Constitution, said social welfare minister P Viswaroop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ambedkar-project-sent-to-judicial-preview-body/articleshow/81556362.cms||Samdani MN

RJD MLCs raised the murder of a PACS chairman at an East Champaran village on Tuesday. RJD MLC Ram Chandra Purbey said every day some crime or the other is happening since the budget session began. “This is an issue to be debated the message is not going out that the assembly session is on. Earlier, people were afraid that the matter would be raised in the House,” said Purbey, to which another MLC Subodh Kumar added, “What can be expected when a cabinet minister talks of sorting out the issue in Gandhi Maidan.” Subodh was hinting at Ram Surat Rai. Later on, BJP MLCs Rajneesh Kumar and Nawal Kishore Choudhary also intervened and asked Subodh not to dictate the acting chairperson, who had rejected their proposal for adjournment of the House. After a verbal dispute for nearly five minutes, the session began. Meanwhile, deputy CM Renu Devi informed that Bihar is the first state in the country to formulate its ethanol production policy. She said the policy got cabinet approval on March 16 and CM Nitish Kumar’s dream of making Bihar self-sufficient in the production of ethanol and the creation of jobs will become true with this step. Deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, who also holds charge of the urban development and housing department told the Upper House that as soon as the proposal of Rs 35 crore given by BUIDCO is accepted all defunct traffic signals will be repaired in Patna. He was replying to a question raised by MLC Radha Charan Sah. He said in Patna, 75 traffic signals were installed, and the agreement for their maintenance was till December 31 2018. Rest 22 signal maintenance period is valid till December 31 this year. In the same session, CPI MLC Kedar Nath Pandey raised the issue of problems being faced by beneficiaries as they were not getting the flats from builders on time, despite timely payment and asked the government to instruct RERA to take action on such builders. He particularly pointed towards one ongoing construction by Anu Anand Construction on Danapur-Khagaul road, which began in 2013 and was supposed to be handed to the buyers in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/furore-in-council-over-pacs-chairmans-killing/articleshow/81555618.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Earlier, the fish were fed manually by fishermen twice a day. Through automated programmed devices, feeding has increased to six times a day. Funded by the National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB), CMFRI Visakhapatnam Regional Centre had been pioneering sea cage culture of two marine fin fish species, namely orange spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) and Indian pompano (Trachinotus mookalee). Currently, there are five cages of Indian pompano and 10 cages where Groupers are being cultured in the Bay of Bengal off RK Beach. Speaking to TOI, senior scientist and scientist-in-charge at CMFRI Vizag, Subhadeep Ghosh, said, “Earlier, fishermen used to go out in boats and feed the fish kept in sea cages twice a day. But now we have switched from manual feeding to automated feeder machine, which is pre-programmed to give the pelleted feed six times a day. Using a mobile app, the amount of feed and timing can be pre-decided. After switching to automated feeders, we noticed that the fish registered a higher growth rate or increase in weight from 500-600 grams to 750-800 grams per fish. The production per cage has also gone up from about 1.5 to nearly two tonnes.” Recently, partial harvest of half a tonne of Indian pompano was undertaken by CMFRI for exporting to Kerala as per demand. C Suvarna, chief executive of NFDB Hyderabad, who was present at the harvest site, said, “Marine fin fish culture is gaining momentum in India due to its taste and high nutritional value. To popularise the culture techniques for these two species in pond as well as in cages, the project was taken up by CMFRI, Vizag centre. These pilot projects will motivate the fisherfolk and farmers to take up culture of these high-value fish, which have got both a domestic and an export market.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/automated-feeder-transforms-scope-of-fish-growth-production/articleshow/81556389.cms||Sulogna Mehta

The elephants entered Kosali, Keesara and Ghanasara villages in search of water and damaged maize, sugarcane, cashew and other horticulture crops in the hamlets. Officiald of the forest department said that during the summer, the elephants walk from one reserve forest to another in search of food and water. To mitigate the decade-long elephant menace in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts, the forest department plans to establish an emergency elephant holding facility in Vizianagaram district.

---||Goa||GFP cautions govt against targeting civic director||PANAJI: Any attempt to target, harass or transfer the director of municipal administration Gurudas Pilarnekar as payback for the fresh notification on reservation for the coming municipal elections will be opposed, said Goa Forward Party here on Wednesday. GFP working president Kiran Kandolkar said that the government was trying to transfer Pilarnekar after several BJP top brass and karyakartas expressed anguish over the new reservations which have been done as directed by the Supreme Court. With reservation of wards for five municipal councils being revised, a significant number of BJP-backed candidates, including their senior karyakartas, find themselves unable to contest. This has sparked consternation within the BJP camp, said Kandolkar. “After the new reservation has been announced, the BJP karyakartas and their candidates are frustrated and angry. They seem to be making all kinds of statements and talking about moving the courts,” said Kandolkar. Kandolkar said that the blame for the election fiasco lies solely with the BJP-led government, which ignored the advice not to challenge the high court’s order on the municipal elections. “The Supreme Court has taken the final decision and many of them don’t seem to understand this. Many wise people in politics had advised the government not to challenge the high court’s order before the Supreme Court, but chief minister Pramod Sawant did not listen. Many BJP candidates who are now out of the running are saying that injustice has been meted out to them,” said Kandolkar. GFP said that any move to target Pilarnekar would be seen as an insult on the Bahujan Samaj and on honest officers. After the Supreme Court’s order, the officer from the Bhandari Samaj has done his duty in the right manner,” said Kandolkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-cautions-govt-against-targeting-civic-director/articleshow/81557936.cms||---

Phulwarisharif SDPO Manish Kumar Sinha said Yadav was rushed to PMCH where he died. Sinha said Yadav had chased the thieves with a bamboo when they were fleeing after stealing valuables from the residence of his neighbour Aklu Yadav (64). “Yadav had caught hold of the thief in the dark. However, the thief pulled out a pistol and fired in the air. But Yadav pinned down a thief, who shot at him in his abdomen,” he said. Sinha said the thief was able to set himself free and fled from the spot. The SDPO said other villagers reached the spot and rushed Yadav to PMCH. He said at least five thieves had entered Aklu’s residence. “They had locked the room in which the family was sleeping. They stole cash, jewellery and other valuables from an adjacent room and came out. Yadav thought they were Aklu’s family members and asked why they were standing out in the dark. “However, one of the thieves hurled a brick on Yadav after which he started screaming and raised an alarm about the theft. Other villagers also came out and started chasing the thieves,” Sinha said. The SDPO said police suspect some insider’s role in the theft. He said investigation was on to ascertain the identity of those who were involved in the theft as well as the killing of Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-shot-at-by-thieves-in-naubatpur-area-dies/articleshow/81555626.cms||---
---||Madurai||Covid SOP checks, fines fail to bring masks back on faces||Madurai/Trichy: As a result of the increase in Covid-19 cases in the south- central districts, the district administrations and health authorities have stepped up vigil and started fining those who violate Covid-19 safety norms. But still, people rarely wear masks, while being in public places. In Madurai, nearly 90% of the people don’t wear a mask in public places, and the violation is more in meetings of political parties, where the caution in terms of physical distancing is also not maintained at all. Even in cinema theaters, among the last of the industries to be given the green signal by the government, viewers come without wearing masks. “No one asks us to wear masks even in the big theaters,” said K Karthikeyan of Anna Nagar. Malls also see the violation in large-scale. “Though the government has stressed that handsanitizing and masks are a must for political events, they are not possible to monitor and check,” said an official, adding that it is the responsibility of the people. Madurai has 93 active cases, which is the highest in the southern region, and 19 new cases were reported on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the district administrations have started conducting surprise checks on various places. In Dindigul, collector M Vijayalakshmi inspected the supply of Covid-19 prevention materials including masks, thermal scanners and handsanitizers to be supplied to the 25,000 people who will be on poll duty in the district. The collector also inspected some mills and factories in the district to see whether the Covid norms were followed properly. In Ramanathapuram district, collector Dinesh Ponraj Oliver chaired a meeting of the officials where he asked them to ensure strict enforcement of Covid-19 norms. People not wearing masks in public would be slapped with a fine of Rs 200 and commercial establishments, marriage halls and gyms not ensuring the safety measures including physical distancing would be fined Rs 5,000, he said. Deputy director of health services (DDHS), Trichy, Dr S Ramganesh, who is the nodal officer for imposition of the fines against the Covid-19 violations, said that fine for violating mask rule will be strictly followed as per the Tamil Nadu Public Health (TNPH) Act. “The practice of people wearing masks has gradually come down over the period of time. The spike in fresh cases is giving us an indication that the safety protocols must be followed,” DDHS told TOI on Wednesday. Acting tough against those breaking the norms of safety measures, the public health department, police, revenue department and local bodies including Trichy Corporation individually booked 15,148 cases for violating the safety norms under the sections of TNPH Act. In total, the authorities collected Rs 28 lakh as fine between September 14, 2020 and March 14. Going by the data accessed by TOI, half of the fine amount was collected in just three weeks from the commencement of the enforcement, but it took another five months to collect the rest. Considering the sudden rise in the past one week, the public health department stepped up the measure from Tuesday based on the instructions from the state health department and Trichy collector S Sivarasu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/covid-sop-checks-fines-fail-to-bring-masks-back-on-faces/articleshow/81557933.cms||Gokul Rajendran

Even as the economy is forecast to shrink by over 7% during the current fiscal, the non-life industry is set to post a growth of over 4%. This is expected to result in a significant jump in insurance penetration (ratio of premium to GDP). Insurance penetration has been creeping up from 0.7% in FY15 to 0.94% in FY20 when the total premium was Rs 1.9 lakh crore. “The industry was around Rs 10,000 crore in 2000 and is expected to be around Rs 2 lakh crore in FY21. By 2030, the industry should expand to Rs 8 lakh crore, assuming growth of 14%,” said HDFC Ergo MD & CEO Ritesh Kumar. He added that the industry was in a good place and HDFC Ergo has participated in its growth. The private non-life insurer recently integrated Apollo Munich Health with itself. The move makes it a formidable player in the health segment and the third-largest non-life insurer. Earlier in 2016, HDFC Ergo had acquired L&T General Insurance and got a big chunk of the motor cover business in the country. The acquisition helped HDFC Ergo leapfrog from a 0.8% market share in 2008 to 6.2% in 2021. Kumar said that HDFC Ergo would be open to more acquisition if it filled any “white space” in its portfolio, provided the valuation was acceptable. Highlighting the segments which would see increased growth, Kumar said that small and medium enterprises were highly under-penetrated by the industry and would see accelerated growth. According to Kumar, both HDFC and Ergo are bullish on growth in India. “We were ranked 28th among global non-life markets in 2000 and have moved to the 15th position now. Given present trends, we should be ranked between 6th and 8th by 2030,” he said. To leverage the growth potential, the industry would require capital of around Rs 1.5 lakh crore until 2030, and half of it would come from internal accruals. “As the industry will require Rs 75,000 crore of capital, the decision to increase foreign direct investment will bring in one more source of capital for the industry,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/non-life-biz-to-expand-hdfc-ergo/articleshow/81557328.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Goa||Opposition wants budget deferred till civic poll process ends||PANAJI: Pointing out that any assurances given by the government during the discussion on budgetary demands will amount to violation of the election code of conduct, the opposition parties on Wednesday urged the state government to seek a vote on account on March 24 instead of presenting the full budget. In a coordinated move, the Congress, Goa Forward Party (GFP) and MGP submitted a joint representation to speaker Rajesh Patnekar during a meeting of the business advisory committee of the Goa legislative assembly. The opposition MLAs have also written to governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Central Election Commissioner, and the Goa State Election Commission (SEC) demanding that chief minister Pramod Sawant should be directed to table the annual financial statement and seek a vote on account for 2021-22 in view of the election code of conduct imposed for the municipal elections. While the elections for six civic bodies will be held on March 20, the dates for the remaining five municipal body elections have yet to be announced. As per the notification issued by the SEC on February 22, the elections to 11 municipal councils and Corporation of City of Panaji were scheduled on March 20. However, the ward reservation of five municipal council was challenged before the high court and overturned, a verdict that was upheld by the Supreme Court (SC). The SC has directed the SEC to conduct elections to the five municipal councils in a free and fair manner, before April 30. “When the budget is presented, there is a discussion on the demand for grants and when this is done, there are assurances given which will violate the model code of conduct which will come into force for the five municipal council elections,” GFP president Vijai Sardesai said. The government has yet to announce the election schedule for the Margao, Quepem, Mormugao, Sanguem and Mapusa civic polls. The opposition parties believe that the date of polling is likely to coincide with the budget session. “During the election process and especially when the election code of conduct is in force, it is important that the government in power should not make any announcements, declare any schemes and give any assurances, which may directly or indirectly influence the minds of the people and have an impact on the elections,” said opposition leader Digambar Kamat. The opposition said that the government should not be permitted to make any assurances or announce new schemes for public benefit. Kamat also said that the assembly session needs to be adjourned until the election for the five municipal councils are concluded and results declared. “The House can be reconvened after the day of the election to take up the remaining business,” said Sardesai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oppn-wants-budget-deferred-till-civic-poll-process-ends/articleshow/81557937.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP CM Yogi Adityanath rips apart Congress in Assam, says party promoting intruders||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday tore into Congress, accusing it of threatening the nation’s security by promoting illegal immigration in various states, including Assam. Offering prayers at one of the oldest Shakti peeths, Kamakhya Devi temple, before addressing rallies in Hojai, Kalaigaon and Rangia assembly seats of the poll-bound north-eastern state, Yogi reiterated BJP’s vow of freeing Assam of illegal migrants. “Congress ki tushtikaran ki rajneeti ke chalte ghuspathiyon ne bahut kshetron mein rashtriya suraksha ke liye khatra paida kiya (Congress’ appeasement politics helped infiltrators to threaten nation’s security),” he said. Yogi’s attack on Congress comes at a time when the grand old party has stitched a ‘mahajot’ (grand alliance) with various political parties, including All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), former BJP ally Bodoland People’s Front, Left parties and RJD to throw up a formidable challenge to the saffron political outfit, which seeks a second consecutive term in Assam. The UP chief minister raked up illegal migration even as Congress made its opposition to the citizenship law as a poll plank by maintaining that CAA was in conflict with Assam Accord, which entails detection and deportation of immigrants, including Hindus who entered Assam after March 24, 1971. Yogi charged Badruddin Ajmal-led AIUDF, a key Congress ally, with channelizing illegal migration. “And therefore, the Assam assembly elections are a ‘maha-chunav’ to save the cultural identity of the state,” he said, insisting that Congress was largely concerned about usurping power at any cost while putting welfare of people on the back-burner. He also accused Congress of influencing the Bodo movement and pushing the region into anarchy driven by militancy and separatism. Invoking the 15th century Assamese social reformer Srimanta Sankardev, he credited him of saving the north-eastern state through an outlook of ‘Sanskritik Rashtravaad’ (cultural nationalism). Yogi said, it was Sankardev, who voiced his concern against illegal migration in the country, which is why Congress never gave due recognition to him. Strongly backing policies of PM Narendra Modi that helped BJP in forming a government in the state in 2016, Yogi said, the decision to abolish Article 370 from Jammu & Kashmir and bringing in a law against triple talaq were aimed to bring in much-needed reforms. Yogi stressed that BJP government’s policies have never been discriminatory in terms of caste, class or region. “BJP has been driven by policy of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’. There was no room for appeasement of one particular community,” he said, emphasising that Northeast was craving for development until PM Modi came up with the ‘Look East’ and ‘Act East’ policy, which required a minister of the Central cabinet to visit North-Eastern states and assess implementation of Central government policies regularly. “People need a government which provides development, ensures jobs and safety to women,” he said. Yogi also invoked Ram terming him a symbol of culture and nationalism. “Ram ke bagair Bharat ka kaam chal hi nahi sakta hai…,” he said, insisting the Hindu God held a place of pride in the heart and soul of every one. “Today, work on Ram Temple in Ayodhya has begun. This is the new Bharat, where nobody was allowed to play with the culture and tradition of the country,” he said. The UP CM said, the people need to support BJP to ensure its victory like they overcame the pandemic under the leadership of PM Modi. “The welfare schemes of the Centre too were not driven by caste or class consideration,” Yogi said, while recounting schemes like Ayushman, Ujjwala and Saubhagya scheme. He also said that the Centre and the Assam government were in the process of preparing an action plan to mitigate the problem of floods in Assam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-rips-apart-cong-in-assam-says-party-promoting-intruders/articleshow/81559373.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Mumbai||As two V-Cs quit, voices about govt harassment grow||Mumbai: Two vice-chancellors who resigned last month may have put forth “personal” reasons for their decision, but several people familiar with the development said “harassment and interference” from the state forced them to quit. A diktat from the higher education minister’s OSD is said to have been the last straw for Vedala Rama Sastry, who was the vice-chancellor of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University, Lonere. He and Pradip Patil of Kavayitri Bahinabai Chaudhari North Maharashtra University, Jalgaon, put in their papers in the last week of February. In Sastry’s case, a letter from the higher education minister’s OSD directed his university to alter the books of records to show two Mantralaya appointees as university staff and release their monthly compensation from the varsity funds retrospectively. The minister’s officer on special duty (OSD) Prasad Ukarde said he could not remember such a letter. “I will go through my records and get back to you,” he said. He did not take further calls. The letter to Sastry, a copy of which is with TOI, was dated February 25 and asked for the salaries to be paid retrospectively from February 1. “These two contractual employees were appointed in Mantralaya, but the university was expected to show them on its rolls and also pay them a monthly salary,” a person familiar with the letter said. “Earlier, this minister nominated four members to the management council, who included contractors — not really academicians —interested in only one business of the university, the building works contracts.” The previous government had nominated academicians from IIT-B, a Padma Shree awardee and a retired banker. A vice-chancellor, requesting anonymity, said the pressure on them was intense. “Almost on a daily basis people from the minister’s office call for details of tenders and contracts. The V-C of a prominent Mumbai deemed institute that is constructing its additional campus was pressured into awarding the work to a certain contractor,” the V-C said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/as-two-v-cs-quit-voices-about-govt-harassment-grow/articleshow/81557945.cms||---

The attachment proceedings followed the nod of a Lucknow court. An EOW official said, Badri Narayan Tiwari owns a Hindi news channel and manufactures batteries used in running bikes owned by Garvit Innovators Promoters Limited (GIPL), a front company for the scam. He was arrested by Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (UPSTF) last month. “GIPL was a company owned by scam mastermind Sanjay Bhati, who conned 2.6 lakh people by launching a ponzi scheme, Bike Bot, by luring people to invest with a promise of doubling their money in a year. Tiwari had met GIPL co-owner, Vijendra Singh Hooda, in Noida and wooed him into the business,” said ASP, EOW, Ram Suresh Yadav. Yadav said, Badri was appointed financial advisor to Bhati’s multiple companies and he duped investors of Rs 41 crore, which he ploughed into his own firm, Mars Group of Companies, to buy luxury cars, plots in Lucknow and a Rs 4crore waste-to-energy plant, which lies buried under paddy in the native village of Bhati brothers, the officer said.

---||Goa||Vishwajit panel strong, but Valpoi locals want pending issues resolved||VALPOI: As many as 22 candidates, including sitting councillors and four former chairpersons are in the fray for the Valpoi Municipal Council (VMC) election which is scheduled for March 20. The BJP panel supported by health minister and Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane, few candidates supported by the Congress and independent candidates will be vying to win the poll. Of the 10 wards, elections will be held for nine wards, as Nirmala Sakhalkar of Rane’s panel was elected unopposed from ward 8. In the last civic polls, when Rane was in the Congress, as many as eight of his candidates were elected, while the other two - Atul Dantye (ward 3) and Rashikant Chari (ward 4) - were BJP-supported candidates. After Rane switched over to the BJP, both Dantye and Chari also joined Rane’s panel. However, for this election, the duo is not able to contest as their wards are in the reserved category. Reservation of wards has upset the plans of some prominent BJP and Congress-backed councillors, including the outgoing chairperson, as they are now unable to re-contest from their home turf. All those whose wards have been reserved have decided not to recontest from other wards. Some voters told TOI that employment is the major issue. Although providing government jobs does not in the least come under the purview of the municipal council, there seems to be dissatisfaction among the voters as the “promise of providing jobs made during the run-up of the assembly elections has not been fulfilled”. Political observers state that being a minister for many years, Rane has sway over Valpoi town, but the undercurrent of dissatisfaction of not being given jobs is palpable. However, a lack of viable alternatives gives an advantage to his panel. An announcement by the health minister stating that thousands of government jobs will be provided appears to be a strong factor that could lead to the victory of his candidates, a political observer said. However, those in the opposition allege that the BJP government has totally failed on several fronts, and fake assurances on government jobs will not help it in the civic polls. Devendra Gaonkar, an independent candidate from ward 1, said, “Just to win the election, BJP is lying to the youth that they will give them thousands of jobs.” Voters said that the other issue is of traffic congestion, which has remained unresolved despite assurances given by the former chairpersons. Some wards are also facing water woes supply for the past two years, they said. VMC’s outgoing chairperson Akhtar Shah said that in the last five years the council has undertaken many works, such as “repairing of interior roads, commencing work of the municipal sports ground, construction of gutters, maintaining proper drainage system, renovation of crematorium ground, upgradation of garbage treatment plant and regularly desilting of nullahs”. GPCC president Girish Chodankar while canvassing in Valpoi on Tuesday said that “since the election is not on party lines, Congress has just supported seven candidates”. “The local unit of the Congress has been entrusted the responsibility of devising a strategy to defeat the BJP-backed candidates,” Chodankar told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vishwajit-panel-strong-but-valpoi-locals-want-pending-issues-resolved/articleshow/81557947.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Soon after bride’s ‘bidaai’, Mumbai cops make groom weep, arrest him for e-fraud||A 28-year-old man from Noida ended up spending his wedding night in the company of police personnel instead of exchanging sweet nothings with his new bride. Moments after his 26-year-old bride from Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar was given a tearful send-off by her relatives, a police team from Mumbai intercepted the vehicle carrying the newly-wed couple and took away the groom. The 28-year-old groom from Noida had been booked for online fraud and the police were looking for him, sources said. He was detained on Tuesday night. The incident took place on the outskirts of Sathedi village in Budhana region. The ‘baraat’ ended up reaching Noida without the groom. The bride was with the groom’s family. The groom, who had spent some time abroad, was involved in providing online passport service and has an office in Noida, sources said. He has been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 420 (cheating), at a cyber police station in Mumbai after some locals filed complaints against the online company which used to allegedly cheat people, promising services for issuing a passport. A few days ago, a team from Mumbai police visited Noida, but couldn’t find the accused. They managed to recover certain documents and a list of phone numbers from his office. One of the phone numbers helped them trace the man’s whereabouts. Mumbai police, along with local cops, then laid a trap outside Sathedi village and picked up the groom. Budhana station house officer MS Gill said, “The man has cheated many people in Mumbai. We assisted Mumbai police, as per the law. He will be now taken to Mumbai.” The man has IT knowhow and ran the firm in Noida for several months, sources said. Shubhangi, a police officer who was leading the Mumbai police team, said, “We are gathering all relevant details pertaining to this case. A thorough investigation is being conducted. Our seniors will update everyone soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/soon-after-brides-bidaai-cops-make-groom-weep-arrest-him-for-e-fraud/articleshow/81559534.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Aurangabad||RT-PCR tests negative, but CT scans still show lung infection||Aurangabad: Negative report of the RT-PCR test for Covid-19 among patients who later developed lung infection has become a cause for concern for the patients and their families. One private professional said his 76-year old father could not opt for Covid-19 treatment at the state-run health care centre due to the negative result from the RT-PCR test. “My father had lost appetite since early March and the doctor treating him suspected possible Covid-19 infection. The antigen test done earlier and RT-PCR test on March 9 showed negative results, despite high-grade lung infection in my father. He was admitted to a private hospital and received treatment for Covid-19 before getting discharged on March 16,” he said. Narrating his ordeal, a 46-year-old private professional said his health worsened as he relied on the result of RT-PCR test done on March 8. “I was having sore throat and mild fever for four to five days. The RT-PCR test showed negative result. I continued the treatment with my physician but I developed serious breathing difficulties later and need hospitalization. The CT scan revealed moderate lung infection and declared me as suspected Covid patient. It was confirmed after another RT-PCR test was done three days later,” he said. Notably, several incidents of ‘false negative’ results during Covid testing were reported during October last year in parts of Marathwada and an inquiry had revealed the use of testing kits of substandard quality. These kits were subsequently recalled. Dr Rekha Bajaj, in-charge of Covid testing facility at Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad did not respond to calls or SMSes sent to her, seeking her response to the developments. Another senior GMCH official said the RT-PCR test is highly sensitive and can produce false negatives as an exception. “As per protocol, repetition of RT-PCR test is sought in patients showing negative test results but having symptoms of Covid-19. Also, patients with SARI exhibit same symptoms as that of Covid-19,” he said, preferring anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/rt-pcr-tests-negative-but-ct-scans-still-show-lung-infection/articleshow/81555553.cms||---

He later joined the DMK in the presence of party functionaries. N Kanagaraj, 48, former Vadakadu panchayat president, was one among the party members who was keen on contesting from the Alangudi Assembly segment. To the surprise of the party members, the AIADMK high command fielded Tharma Thangavel, who joined AIADMK six weeks ago. He was the south district president of the Congress in Pudukottai district. He quit the party in January and joined AIADMK. AIADMK cadres have hit the road ever since the announcement came on March 11. Kanagaraj was one among them, as he was expecting the party high command to change the candidate. On Monday, chief minister Edapapdi K Palaniswami was in Pudukottai and campaigned for Dharma Thangavel in Alangudi. Learning that the party high command is not going to change the candidate, Kanagaraj took all the dhotis with AIADMK colour borders and set them on fire in front of the memorial raised for former AIADMK minister A Venkatachalam in Vadakadu. Speaking to TOI, Kanagaraj said that he along with his party members was working against the Congress. But the party high command gave the seat to a man who joined the AIADMK only a few weeks ago. We have become a laughing stock over such a decision by the party. “I have been in the party for the last 30 years. If not me, at least a family member of former minister Venkatachalam should have been given the party ticket,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/aiadmk-functionary-protest-ticket-for-ex-cong-man-set-dhotis-on-fire/articleshow/81557951.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The incident was reported from Ganeshpur village under the limits of Shivli Kotwali police station in Kanpur Dehat district. The police recovered the battered body of Kailashnath from Devipur village on the morning of March 13. Subsequently, an investigation was launched following an FIR filed by the victim’s family. The police on Tuesday arrested two persons, including the victim’s friend Shiv Narain Pal and his aide Raghuveer Pal in this connection. Shiv Narain lives with his family in Devipur village in Shivli and earned a livelihood by farming four ‘bighas’ of land. “As family elders were pressuring him for marriage, he sought help from his friend Kailashnath of Ganeshpur village,” the police said. “Kailashnath arranged a match for Shiv Narain in Bihar and told him that as the woman comes from poor financial background, her parents need money to host the wedding,” police added. Shiv Narain disposed off a patch of his land and lent Rs 3 lakh to Kailashnath and the marriage was solemnised in Bihar recently. While Shiv Narain along with his newly wed wife was on way to Kanpur Dehat from Bihar, she ran away along with gold jewellery. Later, Shiv Narain came to know that his bride was a eunuch. “Angry over the episode, when Shiv Narain called up Kailashnath to return the money he took for the wedding, he threatened him of dire consequences. Realizing that he had been conned, he decided to eliminate him,” said Inspector Shivli Pramod Kumar Shukla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/tricked-into-marrying-an-eunuch-man-kills-friend/articleshow/81557317.cms||---
---||Allahabad||UP: Seeking payment in bitcoin via ransomware new cybercrime trend||PRAYAGRAJ: For sleuths of UP Police’s cybercrime cell, it’s proving to be a tough task to bust the networking of cyber goons who are using ransomware as a method of extortion and targeting chartered accountants (CAs), prominent hospitals and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) in the state. According to experts, cybercriminals tend to want payment via a given bitcoin address since these methods of payment are virtually untraceable for law enforcement agencies. Officials posted at UP’s cybercrime cell in the state capital admitted that over a dozen such cases, including seven in Lucknow and one in Prayargraj, are pending investigation where cybercriminals targeted CAs, hospitals and high-net-worth individuals across the state. SP (Cybercrime) Triveni Singh told TOI, “Cybercriminals are using Ransomware - a form of malware that either blocks access to files (via encryption) or holding individual or organisation computer hostage. Once cybercriminals manage to hack the victims or an organisation’s computer, they infect it with ransomware and demand a ransom amount to be made in a bitcoin address to retrieve data.” He, however, claimed that cyber experts are taking up a mass awareness campaign among individuals and organisations and offering tips to prevent a ransomware attack. SP said, “If you’ve received a questionable and unwanted file or link or received a pop-up window, you must be aware and make sure to contact the law enforcement agency. In such a situation, it’s better to turn off the infected computer and disconnect it from any networks that it could be connected to. By containing the malware, any individual can prevent further damage to other computers within your network.” He added, “UP police’s cyber cell experts are creating awareness among possible target groups about the ‘ransom malicious software’ which can infect their computer and display messages demanding a fee to be paid for your system to work again.” This malware can be installed or enter a system through deceptive links in an email message, instant message or website. Singh said that cybercriminals involved in ransomware attack often do footprinting (a technique used for gathering information about computer systems and the entities they belong to) and profiling before executing the ransomware attack.  Cyber attackers have been shifting their aim towards entrepreneurs to exploit the lack of cybersecurity awareness amongst start-ups and SMEs as well. Cyber experts, meanwhile, admitted that the cases of attacks have gone up during the Covid-19 pandemic across the country. The cybercriminals or hackers deliberately choose a ransom price that targets are more willing to pay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/seeking-payment-in-bitcoin-via-ransomware-new-cybercrime-trend/articleshow/81556397.cms||Kapil Dixit

Senior police officials claimed that a probe report into the death of five persons due to alleged consumption of spurious liquor in three villages of Handia block, revealed laxity on the part of policemen, for not taking corrective measures against the illegal sale and purchase of spurious liquor in trans Ganga area. Visceras of all five deceased have been preserved for analysis and four policemen were found guilty for not performing their duties sincerely. On Wednesday, a joint team of police and administration including DM and SSP (Prayagraj) also visited Saidabad and interacted with the family members and the villagers. Officials,meanwhile, admitted that over 10 people had died under mysterious circumstances between March 14 and 16 in villages including Beenda, Sangrampatti and Saray Mansoor.

In rest five cases, a joint team of police and administration was carrying out a detailed probe. The post-mortem of these persons was conducted and viscera was preserved to find out whether they had died due to consumption of spurious liquor.

---||Varanasi||MLA Alka Rai writes another letter to Priyanka, slams Cong||Varanasi: BJP MLA Alka Rai, the widow of slain MLA Krishnanand Rai, has shot another letter to Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra alleging that prison minister of Congress-ruled Punjab is enjoying hospitality of the henchmen of jailed mafia don and MLA Mukhtar Ansari in UP. Rai further said that Punjab government’s protection to Mukhtar Ansari has increased life threat for her family as well as people fighting cases pending against the don. Rai, who wrote the first letter to Priyanka in October 2020 asking her to direct the Congress government in Punjab to send Mukhtar to UP for trial of pending cases, penned her fourth letter on March 15 and also released a video message. “Punjab government has kept Mukhtar as a state guest in Ropar jail. On the other hand, Punjab’s prison minister Sukhjindar Singh Randhawa is touring UP districts and enjoying the hospitality of Mukhtar’s henchmen,” she alleged. Rai said, “Priyanka would have realized the pain I suffered had she faced circumstances like me. It is shocking that Priyanka has not replied to any letter while the Punjab government is spending lakhs of rupees to hire lawyers to ensure Mukhtar is not sent to UP.” “The sympathy of Congress for the mafia don is causing serious threat to me, my family and people pursuing cases against Mukhtar. If anything untoward happens to me, my family or these people, only Congress party and its government in Punjab would be responsible for it,” said Rai. She expressed hope that this time Priyanka would reply to her letter and take necessary action. The MLA had sent her first letter to Priyanka in October 2020 when a team of UP Police went to Punjab to bring Mukhtar for court hearing but the authorities of Ropar Jail did not hand him over. She sent the second letter in January first week and a third letter on January 30 after photographs of Mukhtar’s son Abbas Ansari’s marriage were posted on social media. Besides Rai, Ashok Singh of Mau who is also fighting the case of the killing of his brother, Ajay Prakash Singh alias Munna, a PWD contractor, in August 2009 followed by murders of prime witnesses in the case Ram Singh Maurya and police constable in March 2010, also sent a letter to Priyanka and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi in February, questioning why Congress-ruled Punjab is shielding the don. Mukhtar has been in Ropar jail since 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/mla-alka-rai-writes-another-letter-to-priyanka-slams-cong/articleshow/81557329.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Cops intensify drive as nine die after consuming spurious liqour ahead of Holi||Prayagraj: The death of nine persons including four in Pratapgarh and five in trans Ganga (Prayagraj) due to the consumption of spurious liquor has set alarm bells ringing for the police and excise department ahead of Holi in the region. Police have claimed to have intensified a major drive against the sale, purchase and production of illegal liquor. Cops have been keeping a strict vigil on 12 villages of trans Ganga and trans Yamuna areas which have been infamous for large-scale hooch production. According to sources, joint teams of police and excise department are running pillar to post to prevent any such incident ahead of Holi. Apart from tightening the noose around racketeers selling pouches of spurious liquor, a strict surveillance has also been maintained on the villages situated along river banks and are regarded as the hub of the production of illegal liquor in the district. A senior cop preferring anonymity said, “Kachar belt has always been infamous for the manufacture of spurious liquor. Many families get engaged in hooch production whenever an important festival like Holi approaches.” “Cops, with the help of villagers, are also carrying out awareness campaigns urging people not to consume illegal liquor,” he added. Raids are also being conducted in several villages of trans Ganga and trans Yamuna areas, and cops have been seizing raw materials and destroying furnaces. The raw materials used include methanol (also known as wood spirits, methyl hydrate, or hydroxymethene), and the deadly concoction could lead to blindness, severe burning in stomach and also cause death. Besides methyl alcohol, other similarly injurious materials are mixed in the combination to enhance the kick of hooch. Moreover, manufactures also add zinc,carbon and rectified spirits to prepare spurious liquor. To add to the danger, many such manufacturers have a wide network, and they are able to escape to other districts and states in case of any untoward incident. Spurious liquor is made using jaggery, alum, ammonium chloride and choice of essence. Instead of traditional ethyl alcohol, methanol is used to add punch to the country-made brew which often proves fatal for consumers. Methanol affects human body including lungs and heart, eyes, liver and kidney. It also causes paralysis of muscles due to acidosis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/cops-intensify-drive-as-nine-die-after-consuming-spurious-liqour-ahead-of-holi/articleshow/81556425.cms||---

The decision was taken after the senior citizens had resorted to a brief hunger strike, demanding a vaccination centre in the city. According to taluka medical officer Ashok Sasane, the vaccination centre will start functioning from March 23. “Currently, there are two vaccination centres for the residents but they both are located outside the city limits. Some senior citizens started a hunger strike on Tuesday to highlight the issue. Hence, we took a note of the same and requested some private hospitals to offer a space on their premises for starting a vaccination centre,” he said. “One private hospital eagerly offered their premises where free Covid vaccine would be administered to senior citizens. The vaccine for Covid-19 has to be given only in a hospital. Since Covid patients are being treated at Nandgaon rural hospital, the facility cannot be used for administering vaccine. Due to this an arrangement was made at two government centres outside the city. But the senior citizens wanted a centre in the city itself owing to which they protested,” he added. Nandgaon is among the talukas that have maximum number of Covid patients. A large number of people from other parts of the state and country arrive at Nandgaon due to the presence of railway station. As on March 17, Nandgaon has as many as 250 active cases of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nandgaon-to-get-new-vax-centre-on-march-23/articleshow/81555609.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Nadim Sevangiya, a tailor and the first patient to have been infected with the dreaded virus during foreign travel, is completely healthy today, but says would never forget the trauma he underwent after testing positive on March 19, 2020. As there was no nCov treatment in private hospital available then, Sevangiya was treated in Rajkot civil hospital. “Those were the scariest days of my life. When I got sick and my family doctor informed the civil hospital, a team took my samples and a few days later the result came as positive. Those few days were the most harrowing times for me and my family,” he recalled. At that time there was no facility of sample testing in Gujarat and Sevangiya’s samples were sent to Pune. “It was the biggest challenge of our lives when I was shifted to the civil hospital under special arrangement,” Sevangiya recounted. Brush with Covid changed Sevangiya’s life — he donated plasma and also helped the team of police and municipal corporation secure people’s cooperation in Jangleswhar area for door-to-door survey and testing.

Politicians have to understand our plight, symbolic and fancy announcements will not deliver the equality and empowerment we seek,” professor T M N Deepak, state president, December 3 movement said.However, the PwDs welcomed the assurance given by the AMMK in their manifesto envisaged at providing a minimum 3% reservation for differently-abled people in local bodies. Stating that Tamil Nadu has over 13 lakh PwDs, activists lamented the lack of representation of PwDs in the candidature for the ensuing assembly election. While Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK) has fielded a PwD candidate in Chennai’s harbour constituency, PwD activists said that the dravidian majors have failed to field differently-abled candidates. “The financial announcement is a temporary measure, we expected parties to facilitate exclusive entrepreneurial training institute for us,” said P Maarikannan, secretary, Trichy district differently-abled welfare association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/disabled-people-unhappy-with-poor-focus-in-manifestos/articleshow/81557960.cms||Deepak Karthik

Many markets did not allow the delivery on Ring Road and while it was business as usual at few other markets. Delivery of grey cloth went as per routine in areas like Puna and Saroli. Many traders on Ring Road got the grey cloth delivered at dyeing mills directly. VEM, is a joint body of seven different textile market associations, including South Gujarat Textile Traders Association (SGTTA), Surat Mercantile Association (SMA), Vyapar Pragati Sangh (VPS), among others. In a meeting held on Monday at Surat Textile Market (STM), the VEM decided to stop delivery of grey cloth from Wednesday. Meanwhile, office-bearers of the Federation of Gujarat Weavers’ Association (FOGWA) claimed that the delivery of grey cloth continued as usual. But VEM officials refuted the claim. “Majority of the big markets on Ring Road did not accept the delivery. Traders from some markets even sent the cloth back when the transporter came for the delivery,” said Arvind Vaid, coordinator of VEM. Banners were put up at a few markets to create awareness about the decision of VEM. Textile traders are demanding a discount of 5% and brokerage of 1%. While on the other hand, FOGWA is refusing the give the discount or brokerage and demanding 10 paisa per metre transport cost. It was FOGWA that first raised the demand for transport cost after which VEM presented their demand for discount. The 6% discount and brokerage were discontinued two years ago after GST was introduced. “Majority of weavers are in support of FOGWA and are demanding transport cost. However, it was business as usual on Wednesday since traders accepted the delivery of grey cloth,” said Ashok Jirawala, president FOGWA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/mixed-response-to-cloth-delivery-ban/articleshow/81555530.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Chief secretary VP Joy issued detailed guidelines regarding the use of guest houses, government transport and official visits of ministers in sync with the model code of conduct (MCC). The provisions of MCC state that the party in power, whether at the Centre or in the states concerned, shall ensure that there is no cause for complaint and that it won’t use its official position for the purposes of election campaign. On the basis of these provisions, the chief secretary’s guidelines state that ministers should not combine their official visits with election work and should not make use of official machinery or personnel during campaigning. The instructions further state that government transport – including official aircraft, vehicles, machinery and personnel – should not be used to further the interest of the party in power. Public places such as grounds for holding election meetings and the use of helipads for flights should not be monopolised in connection with election. Other parties and candidates should be allowed the use of such places and facilities on the terms and conditions used by the party in power. When it comes to government accommodations, rest houses, dak bungalows or other government accommodation during elections, they can be given to political functionaries who are provided security by the state in Z-category or above or the equivalent set by state governments or Centre, on equitable basis. However, this would be subject to the condition that such accommodations are not already allotted or occupied by election-related officials or observers. Also, such political functionaries should not do political activity while staying in government accommodations. Ministers have been specifically instructed not to make grants from the discretionary funds available to them and a total ban is in force regarding the transfer of government officials until the conclusion of elections. With the announcement of elections, a total ban is also in force for releasing advertisements, issued by the government, using public money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/chief-secy-issues-order-to-ensure-level-playing-field/articleshow/81556965.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

S Srinivasan, a fruit trader and president of the Chennai Fruit Commission Agent Sangam, Koyambedu, said they get between 50 tonnes and 100 tonnes of the popular fruit every day from Andhra Pradesh and a few districts in Tamil Nadu including Chengalpet. “Over the past 10 days, almost all of our stock is sold and customers have been returning after a day or two for more.” A watermelon is priced between Rs 15 per kg and Rs 20 per kg. Though retail price is slightly higher, it hasn’t crossed Rs 25/kilo. Of the 16 varieties available, the green-striped ‘Namdhari’, ‘Vishal’ which has red pulp and a yellow rind, and ‘Kiran’ which has a dark red pulp, are most popular in the city, shopkeepers said. “We usually stock these three varieties because they sell fast in summers,” said R Raja, a watermelon seller at Southwest Boag Road. Though demand is high, shopkeepers said prices remain the same as last year. “After the lockdown, we had to give away more than 27 tonnes of watermelons to people and we incurred losses of about Rs 1.2 lakh. We were a bit worried about this year, but sales are picking up and, hopefully, would get better by next month,” said Raja. Demand for watermelon juice at juice stalls has also gone up. Nutritionists recommend watermelon as it’s rich in vitamin C and minerals that help lower inflammation, stress and improves heart health. Other fruits such as oranges, grapes and muskmelons are also flying off shelves. The Koyambedu fruit market gets about 100 tonnes of grapes from Karnataka, and Maharashtra every day. Customers have also made inquiries about mangoes, particularly especially Alphonso mangoes. “The mango season will start from this month-end and will go on till June,” said Srinivasan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/watermelon-fever-grips-parched-city/articleshow/81555638.cms||Aditi R

However, Vilas complained to the revenue department that Chandrakat was involved in illegal mining of sand and this had resulted in tension between the two groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/two-killed-in-satara-over-sand-auction/articleshow/81554877.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Civic meetings to stay virtual due to ‘upswing’ in cases, state tells Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The state government has told Bombay high court that considering the spike in Covid-19 cases and an increase in containment zones, it has decided to continue to hold all general body meetings (GBMs) of civic bodies in Maharashtra virtually. The state response was to HC’s February 15 direction to “revisit” its decision to allow GBMs of municipal corporations and municipal councils only through videoconference. The February 15 direction by a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni had come after it had noted the Covid-19 situation in the state was under control and wondered why GBMs could not be held physically. Thane Municipal Corporation corporators had filed two petitions for GBMs to be held physically. The state’s advocate, Reena Salunkhe, on Tuesday submitted the urban development department’s March 1 decision to not hold GBMs physically but to continue them though the virtual medium in view of the upswing in Covid-19 cases all over the state as well as the increase in containment zones. It informed that experts had predicted a second wave of the pandemic if stricter adherence to the Covid health protocol is not followed. The state annexed data from the public health department to the urban development department communication which showed the actual situation of Covid cases and containment zones in almost all the municipal corporations and councils. The urban development department’s communication said the government has decided to revisit the decision after a month based on the ground situation of Covid cases. “That there has been a surge in Covid-19-positive cases is not in dispute. Since the government has proposed to revisit the present decision after one month upon considering the ground realities, we are not inclined to interfere with such a decision. In matters of protocol relating to health and medical care, the court ought to be slow to interfere with the executive policy decision,” said the judges in their March 16 order. They disposed of the petitions expressing “hope and trust that as and when the situation improves and holding of physical GBMs is possible, the urban development department shall not waste any further time to revisit its decision and take an appropriate decision as the facts and circumstances would warrant.” The court had heard two petitions by councillors Ashraf Pathan and Vikrant Chavan of TMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaicivic-meetings-to-stay-virtual-due-to-upswing-in-cases-state-tells-hc/articleshow/81556961.cms||Rosy Sequeira

As the video started doing the rounds on social media, it also merited the attention of police who not only fined him Rs 2,500 but also posted a note along with the youth’s video and a pic of the challan on Twitter, saying: “You worked hard, here is your reward.” A youth from #Agra issued a challan of Rs 2,500 for performing push-ups on a moving #SUV with nobody at the wheel.… https://t.co/3pWiZqYDlm— TOI Agra (@TOIAgra) 1616043776000The video of Ujjwal Yadav performing push-ups on a Mahindra Scorpio SUV owned by his father Krishna Murari Yadav, a Samajwadi Party functionary, was shot in Firozabad last week, said police. The 38-second video tweeted by police comes with a caption, cautioning, “Some push-ups will only bring you down in the eyes of the law,” and the famous ‘Coffin Dance’ meme as the background score to give a somewhat hilarious touch. In the video the youth could be seen apologising for his act: “My name is Ujjawal Yadav. I made a video performing a dangerous stunt on a moving car. This will not be repeated in the future. I apologise for my behaviour.” Confirming the police action against the youth, Firozabad senior superintendent of police Ajay Kumar said, “Taking serious cognisance of the video, traffic police have issued a Rs 2,500 challan to the youth. Besides, he and his father were called to the Jasrana police station and they apologised for the act.” Strict action would be taken against those found violating the Motor Vehicles Act, warned the SSP. “Performing stunts while driving is a punishable offence, it can be harmful to you and others around you. Drive safe, be safe,” said police in the video.

While the NCP is the natural claimant for the seat, the local Sena functionaries have already started preparations for the election. The local Sena unit has decided to get the seat for the party. The byelection was necessitated following the death of NCP’s Bharat Bhelke, who died of Covid in November 2020. His son Bhagirath is a strong candidate and has already started campaigning. However, the NCP leadership has maintained silence on the candidate and has not promised him a ticket so far. Bhalke supporters, however, are aggressive. They feel the sympathy for Bharat Bhelke, who represented constituency thrice, will help Bhagirath win the election. NCP has been facing a major problem in the constituency as it is vertically split ahead of the election. Unexpected changes in office-bearers have disturbed the workers. Bhalke’s nomination is being opposed by a section of the party workers. NCP leaders believe that the party may opt for Bharat Bhelke’s wife, Jayshree, if Bhagirath’s nomination is strongly opposed. Sena’s claim to the seat is likely to pose another problem for the NCP as Shaila Godse has also launched her campaign. Godse had sought a ticket in the 2019 election, but the seat was allotted to BJP, forcing her to withdraw. Her claim is backed by the local Sena cadre. BJP, which has a strong base in Pandharpur, is watching the developments. Pranay Paricharak, the nephew of Prashant Paricharak is also in the fray. The Paricharak family too has a strong base and sympathies in Pandharpur. Senior leader Sudhakar Paricharak died a few months back because of Covid. Sudhakar Paricharak had lost the 2019 election with a margin of 13,000 votes. Sudhakar Autade is another contender for the bypoll. Autade is in touch with both BJP and NCP leaders. He had contested 2019 election as an independent and had gained 53,000 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/pandharpur-bypoll-will-prove-to-be-a-test-for-mva-partners/articleshow/81554949.cms||---

During a recent inspection, officials found these houses were releasing untreated sewage directly into the 62-acre Karanaipudhucheri lake. The issue was brought to notice by a group of Urapakkam youths, who in January 2020 collected Rs 20 lakh through a crowdfunding campaign to clean the lake. When NGT Southern Zone came across this, it constituted a joint-committee with representatives from the revenue department, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and Urapakkam panchayat to look into the matter and suggest remedial measures. In August 2020, the committee confirmed that the lake fringes was being used as a dumping ground and directed local authorities to clean the accumulated waste in two months. During a visit in January 2021, officials found not only the waste cleared, but staff deployed to prevent further dumping and warning notices issued to residents who polluted the lake, said the committee’s report. As a long-term measure, the panchayat implemented 100% door-to-door collection of municipal waste and the lake was fenced off, the report said. The panchayat has also proposed to clean the bushes and strengthen the lake bunds with the help of Environmentalist Foundation of India (EFI) at an estimated Rs 32.37 lakh. After admitting these findings, the NGT in subsequent hearings also told the panel to study water quality and take steps to clear encroachments. In response, TNPCB collected samples from the lake and confirmed that the chemical and bacterial levels had not exceeded prescribed standards. As far as encroachments were concerned, notices were issued to 562 houses and the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board has demarcated encroachments so that they can evicted soon. When these follow-up measures were presented before the tribunal during the March 9 hearing, the NGT directed authorities to implement the promised measures within the deadline mentioned and disposed of the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/562-urapakkam-families-face-eviction/articleshow/81555663.cms||Ram Sundaram

It claimed no false case had been registered against those involved in protests against CAA and the new farm laws. Claiming that sedition law data was kept hidden during Congress’ tenure, the government informed the House that it has sought inputs from various quarters for criminal law reforms and has set up a committee for it. When asked if the sedition law would be amended, MoS (home) G Kishan Reddy said the government was going to take a “big step”. “The central government does not give any direction to any state government to arrest anyone. This act is there from the time of the Congress government. As far as conviction is concerned, judgments have not come in some cases,” the minister said. “During the current farmers’ agitation, different statements have been given, but the government has not intervened,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-no-political-agenda-behind-sedition-cases/articleshow/81560210.cms||---

---||Trichy||On a hat-trick, AIADMK faces tough battle in Manapparai||Trichy: Manapparai assembly segment is all set to witness a high voltage triangular contest in the upcoming assembly election with AIADMK’s incumbent MLA R Chandrasekar keen to register a hat-trick victory. The other highlights of the battle will be the Manithaneya Makkal Katchi (MMK) contesting on DMK’s rising sun symbol while the newly formed AMMK-DMDK alliance is also in the fray. Formed only in 2008, Manapparai has a mix of backward class and scheduled caste communities while minorities constitute one-third of the population. A majority of the people are engaged in agriculture and related activities but without proper source of irrigation, many have migrated to Tirupur for work. A large number of young girls are either employed in cotton mills in Tiripur or engaged in making popular savouries like “Manapparai Murukku”. In 2016, DMK’s ally Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), and in 2011, Congress had contested in their own symbols but without success. MMK is expected to give a tough competition to the others in the fray. Its candidate and general secretary P Abdul Samad believes the popular DMK symbol will give him an advantage besides the anti-incumbency factor against the AIADMK. “Manapparai remains one of the most neglected constituencies in the state despite AIADMK winning twice. There are no industries and people are migrating to neighbouring districts for work. There is drinking water shortage and no proper source of irrigation,” he said. Asked if the outsider tag will not affect his prospects as he belongs to Kalpakkam, Samad said AIADMK MLA Chandrasekar had not done anything for the constituency. “We will ask for an opportunity to implement the DMK election manifesto which promises many schemes for the region,” he said. The AMMK-DMDK alliance has fielded P Krishna Gopal of DMDK who came third in the last election securing over 26,000 votes. Gopal says a government arts college for Manapparai has remained an unfulfilled poll promise of AIADMK in the last two elections. A cold storage for flower cultivators to supply flowers to scent factory has also been pending for long. “We are seeking an opportunity to bring about a change,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/on-a-hat-trick-aiadmk-faces-tough-battle-in-manapparai/articleshow/81557965.cms||Sampath Kumar

---||Pune||2 former channel operators held in bank data theft case||Pune: The city cybercrime police on Wednesday arrested a woman MBA graduate and two proprietors of a now defunct Marathi news channel in Aurangabad in connection with the theft of sensitive pan-India data of some private bank account holders and trading the information with buyers in a bid to siphon off funds.A preliminary police assessment has pegged the total money lying in these dormant bank accounts at Rs216 crore. “We arrested Rajesh Sharma (42) and Paramjitsingh Sandhu (40), both from Aurangabad, and Anagha Modak (40) of Sinhagad Road on Wednesday evening. Modak has done her MBA (finance) and runs a share trading business. Sharma and Sandhu used to run the Marathi news channel that stopped functioning a few months ago,” DCP (cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake told TOI. The three were part of the group that wanted to buy the stolen bank data, she added.Contrary to the police’s initial statement on Tuesday about nine arrests, the actual number of initial arrests was eight. Modak, Sharma and Sandhu were among the nine persons detained for questioning to establish their roles in the case. They were formally arrested on Wednesday, taking the total number of arrests to 11. Probe revealed that the suspects had stolen confidential data such as net banking personal identification numbers (PINs) and details of corporate account holders in five private banks for trading the information with buyers willing to siphon off the deposits lying untouched for more than a year.Of the eight arrested on Tuesday, four software engineers were working with the data management centres of these banks. The investigators are establishing whether the data was stolen from these centres or from the banks.Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said, “We have formed 13 teams to investigate the case.

---||Trichy||DMK will cease to exist after poll: EPS||(Cleared/Gopa) Trichy: There was not letup in the ongoing war of words between DMK president M K Stalin and chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami with the latter claiming on Wednesday that DMK will cease to exist after the assembly elections. Campaigning at Nachiyarkovil in Thiruvidaimarudhur constituency in Thanjavur as apart of his second day’s campaign in the central districts, Palaniswami termed the DMK alliance opportunistic and the AIADMK’s victorious. “In your dreams,” EPS said in Kumbakonam referring to Stalin’s claims of making a clean sweep this time. “AIADMK alliance will become stronger but DMK will not exist after the assembly elections,” he said. Speaking in the agrarian belt, EPS’s speech was centred around agriculture and water management. He said since a farmer has become CM, a slew of projects are being implemented for them. “Karunanidhi, despite being the chief minister several times, and DMK betrayed farmers by remaining silent on the construction of Kabini dam,” he said.  EPS blamed the DMK government for allowing the hydrocarbon project in the delta districts. Paying heed to the apprehension of the farmers, it was the AIADMK government which declared it as protected agriculture zone, he said. “In the event of Amma’s rule prevailing in the state again, Cauvery-Godavari river interlinking project will become successful,” he said. Listing out the 7.5 % internal reservation in NEET for government school students, plans to start 11 new medical colleges, the CM asked Stalin whether such projects were implemented under the DMK government. He also said that while DMK failed to oppose NEET to protect their government, AIADMK went to court opposing NEET but was forced to implement it due to the court’s order. Referring to the severe power failure during the DMK regime, EPS said AIADMK government made Tamil Nadu a power surplus state. During his campaign for Covid-19 survivor and food minister R Kamaraj, EPS said that it was a rebirth for him. Palaniswami campaigned for BJP candidate Poondi S Venkatesan in Thiruvaiyaru, AIADMK candidate of Papanasam K Gopinath, Moovendar Munnetra Kazhagam candidate G M Sridhar Vandayar of Kumbakonam, AIADMK candidates Union S Veeramani of Thiruvidaimarudhur, R Kamaraj of Nannilam and Siva Rajamanickam of Mannargudi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/dmk-will-cease-to-exist-after-poll-eps/articleshow/81557975.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Islamic terror strand of Islam, says Rajasthan textbook||JAIPUR: Drawing the ire of Muslim organisations in the state, the Class XII political science textbook of the Rajasthan government claims that some experts believe “Islamic terrorism as a strand of Islam”. The textbook, published in 2018 under the former BJP government, has a chapter on ‘Terrorism, Criminalization of Politics and Corruption’. Here it quotes anonymous experts stating that “commitment to a particular religion is the main trend of Islamic terrorism”, under the heading ‘Fanaticism and Terrorism’. The text explains Islamic terrorism as martyrdom, perpetrating unlimited barbarism, forcibly amassing wealth and killing and committing atrocities.Acting on a complaint by the Rajasthan Muslim Forum, an apex body of Muslims in the state, Lal Kothi police filed an FIR late on Wednesday night against the Rajasthan State Textbook Board and Sanjiv Passbook for the objectionable content. The body had earlier held two meetings with police commissioner Anand Srivastava. Quoting anonymous experts, the chapter also says that “in Islamic terrorism the terrorist has excessive devotion to Islam rather than any faction or a group”. It also says that "it is also believed that Islam, is not a violent or inhuman”. The chapter also projected Islam as essentially a political ideology. The writer’s comments begin only after the anonymous expert’s comments end. The writer explains Islamic terrorism as "martyrdom, perpetrating unlimited barbarism, forcibly amassing wealth and killing and committing atrocities on innocent people ruthlessly in a most ghastly manner in the name of Allah are some of the features of Islamic terrorism". It goes on to say that "this form of Islam has killed and intimidated more Muslims than other people”. In a section, ‘Nature of Terrorism in India,’ it uses terms like Sikh terrorist and Muslim terrorist in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir demanding a separate state on religious grounds. In the latter part of the section, it says, “In these horrendous attacks there was a direct role of Muslim fundamentalist, the hard-core terrorist, smugglers, and foreign agencies" while describing those behind the Bombay blast in 1993, along with ISI. On Kashmir, it says Islamic terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir comes under the category of religious separatism. The textbook claims that "Pakistan has been quite successful in fomenting religious discontent discord in the mindset of Kashmir and orienting them towards the tendency of excessive devotion to Islam". Bansilal Jakhad, former principal of government school, Jodhpur, was one of the three-member committee who authored and translated the chapter into Hindi. “I didn’t deal with this section and was not aware until it was published,” Jakhad told TOI. Convenor of the book Bhanwar Singh Rathore, who was an associate professor at a government college in Jodhpur and wrote this portion, died in September 2020. The present state government has replaced the state textbooks with NCERT textbooks from the 2021 academic session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/islamic-terror-strand-ofislam-says-raj-textbook/articleshow/81557983.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||Delhi||Delhi: L-shaped answer to ITO traffic woes||NEW DELHI: After several failed plans to decongest ITO, PWD and Delhi Traffic Police, along with the municipal corporation and Delhi Development Authority, are now planning to connect Pragati Maidan, Tilak Bridge and ITO with the help of a T-shaped foot overbridge to cater to at least 3,000 pedestrians that use the stretch every day. The structure would be made in two ‘L’ shapes and then connected together. An official said that since plans like the east-west corridor, U-turns, etc were not able to see the light of the day, they would try to push for finalising this plan and implementing it. The budget is yet to be decided. A senior PWD official said that as a part of this plan, Tilak Bridge railway station would be connected to Pragati Maidan and ITO Metro stations. Once the foot overbridge was made, commuters would be relieved of congestion. Earlier, a skywalk with international facilities and design standards was made to cater to pedestrians, but it didn’t find many takers. The left turn towards Ring Road from Vikas Marg would also be modified. A new parking space would be made near The Times of India building on Bahadurshah Zafar Marg. The other plan envisages decongesting ITO and connecting Anand Vihar in the east to Tikri border in the west through the east-west corridor. This corridor would be built from Anand Vihar to Swami Dayanand Marg, Shri Hanuman Marg, IP Depot and Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg, before moving ahead. Before the foot overbridge was planned, traffic police had written to PWD to conduct a comprehensive study of the stretch and adjoining areas to assess the traffic volume and accident count so that tailor-made solutions could be found. PWD had been asked to assess vehicular volume at the intersection during normal as well as peak hours. Police had also asked for information on how traffic volume was affected during VIP movement, sports events, exhibitions and protests. The details of pedestrian count and parking requirements in nearby areas had also been sought as a part of the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/l-shaped-answer-to-ito-traffic-woes/articleshow/81557999.cms||---

---||Pune||Metro tunnel boring machines’ trials start at Swargate & Civil Court sites||Pune: The trial run of two tunnel boring machines have started from Swargate and Civil Court Metro sites and the actual excavation work would start a few days later, after the MahaMetro officials check their various parameters and are convinced about their performance. The tunnel boring machine (TBM) placed at Swargate would proceed towards Mandai, while the TBM at the Civil Court site would excavate the tunnel towards Kasba Peth after passing under the Mutha riverbed. The tunnels would be excavated about 18 to 25 metres below the ground surface. The TBMs are expected to meet in the Mandai area, where they would be pulled out. Both the machines were assembled over the last couple of weeks. This is the second phase of Metro tunnel excavation. In the first phase, two TBMs completed the tunnels on the Agriculture College-Civil Court stretch. A MahaMetro (Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited) official said the alignment of the second phase of tunnelling was ready. The work would gain momentum after the initial phase of excavation gets over. He said MahaMetro had conducted survey of the buildings along the alignment of the tunnels. “The buildings are unlikely to be affected by the work because the digging would be done deep under the ground level. But we have put the structures in various categories and would observe the impact of the work on them,” the official said. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations), MahaMetro, said, “A detailed plan of the second phase of excavation has been prepared. The work will go ahead in a phased manner from both ends. Required technical experts and manpower are in place at both the sites. The Metro’s underground section would stretch from Agriculture College to Swargate.”The MahaMetro has also planned to deploy the third TBM to dig the second tunnel from the Civil Court-end towards Kasba Peth. The work related to its assembling is in progress. The trials are expected to begin soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metro-tunnel-boring-machines-trials-start-at-swargate-civil-court-sites/articleshow/81557031.cms||---

They said customers and their kin should also ensure that their accounts did not get dormant. The caution comes following the theft of sensitive pan-India data of some private bank account holders and trading the information with buyers in a bid to siphon off funds and arrest of 11 people, including some techies, in the case. Police said nearly all data — names, account numbers, branch names and PINs — stolen from leading banks by the techies was from accounts that were lying dormant for a few years. “Bank accounts become dormant after a long duration and for a number of reasons, including the account holder’s death, which is not informed to the bank. However, the banks should also put in an alert system to find out if anyone, even internally, is trying to access funds or sensitive data of such accounts,” a security expert associated with a Pune-based bank said. “Particularly in case of an account holder’s death, his or her kin must inform the bank on time to avoid dormancy,” a spokesperson of a bank said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/caution-against-accounts-getting-dormant/articleshow/81557027.cms||---
---||India||Demarcate how amici curiae can help: SG tells top court||NEW DELHI: Solicitor general Tushar Mehta on Wednesday adopted an unusually belligerent approach against the emerging trend of amici curiae — advocates appointed to assist the court in adjudication of important cases — stepping beyond their assigned role and urged the Supreme Court to demarcate the contours of assistance from such lawyers. The SG registered strong objection to the court seeking the views of amicus curiae and senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy in the case of alleged extra-judicial killings of civilians by Army and state police in fake encounters in Manipur about substitution of a CBI officer in the court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT), as he was due for promotion and had sought repatriation to CBI. Mehta told a bench of Justices N V Ramana, Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose, “On these issues, the amicus can have no role. How can they suggest names of officers for inclusion in the SIT? How can they assist the court with regard to substitution of an officer in the SIT? Amici curiae cannot be allowed to run the administration or dictate the executive.” Mehta said this was a matter concerning soldiers who while risking their lives were defending the borders and questions were being asked about why they resorted to shooting. But the bench led by Justice Ramana said the issue before the court was substituting a CBI officer in the SIT since he was promoted to the post of DIG. "You save your arguments for an appropriate day," the bench told the SG. But the irrepressible SG said, "Please demarcate the role of amici curiae in such cases. Can the amicus curiae say yes or no to an officer of CBI being replaced in the SIT? Amici curiae are appointed to assist the court on law points emerging in a sensitive case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/demarcate-how-amici-curiae-can-help-sg-tells-top-court/articleshow/81560146.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Pune||Road-widening work begins partly on Kalyaninagar-Wadgaonsheri stretch||Pune: A part of the Hari Nagar road stretch, opposite The Bishop’s Co-Ed School, that leads to Wadgaonsheri from Kalyaninagar has been undertaken for widening. The issue has been long pending due to the land acquisition process. However, after Joseph Colony members agreed to give away the land for development work against a compensation, the work has finally begun, providing major relief to commuters.From Wadgaonsheri towards Kalyani Nagar, a major part of the road was widened nearly three years ago but the area near Hari Nagar, a stretch of neary 200m, was stuck in land acquisition. While a part of the land has been released by Joseph Colony members, the stretch beyond the nullah remains disputed. The disputed stretch, belonging to a private landowner and a Catholic education institute, will be widened only when the dispute is resolved. Residents said the stretch caused major traffic congestion, especially during peak hours, and the widening of the road would ease movement.Wadgaonsheri resident Vilas Galande said, “My office is in Koregaon Park and the road (Hari Nagar stretch) is extremely convenient for reaching Wadgaonsheri, where I reside. That bottleneck has been posing a serious issue and traffic lines stretch for nearly a kilometre during peak hours. The widening will surely solve traffic issues to a great extent.”Resident of Kalyani Nagar and member of Team Swachh, Drayson Dixon, said, “Due to the land acquisition issue, the road-widening work has been stuck for many years. It was a narrow road and office goers had a terrible time passing through this stretch during the pre-Covid period.”Local corporator Yogesh Mulik said, “We have been able to convince the Joseph Colony officials of the need to expand this road and after a lot of effort we have successfully been able to crack the deal. We have given Joseph Colony members a compensation for the land. With regards to the remaining stretch beyond the nullah, we will have to wait and watch what the court orders.”At present, the widening will be done till the nullah, said Mulik. Road-widening will begin in the next 15 days. Mulik said the designated stretch would be widened in 45 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/road-widening-work-begins-partly-on-kalyaninagar-wadgaonsheri-stretch/articleshow/81557038.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The accused was convicted on Tuesday and the Pocso special judge pronounced the sentence on Wednesday. He has also been given 10 years imprisonment and asked to pay three penalties of Rs 25,000 each. Delivering the 60-page order, special judge Sukesh Kumar Jain said, “I have not seen the accused show any regret for the heinous rape.” The court awarded the capital punishment under various sections, including 376(AB) and 376(2), of the Pocso Act and 10 years imprisonment under Section 366(A) for kidnapping. When TOI spoke to the rape survivor’s father, he said, “She has been made to suffer for life, but we are still satisfied with the court’s verdict.” “We hope capital punishment will be given to him soon,” rape survivor’s father added. According to police, the girl was playing along with her siblings in a village near Pilani town of Jhunjhunu district when the accused approached them and asked for a screwdriver to repair his scooter. As soon as the elder 15-year-old boy went inside the house to fetch it, the accused kidnapped the five-year-old and took her 40km away and raped her. The girl was kidnapped at 5.30pm on February 19. Police arrested him later and found the child. “We had constituted a team comprising women police officers and filed the charge-sheet on March 1, 10 days after the arrest of the accused,” said superintendent of police Manish Tripathi, Jhunjhunu. Police presented more than 40 witnesses and 250 documentary evidence in the case. This is the second such case in Jhunjhunu in which capital punishment has been awarded for the rape of minor girl. Three years ago, death penalty was given in a similar case in the district. Congratulating the police team, inspector general of police Hawa Singh Ghumeria, Jaipur range, said, “The speedy judgment and thorough investigation in the case will send out a loud and clear message to those indulging in such crime. This was a very sensitive case and was dealt with utmost sincerity by the investigating officer and other concerned officers of the Jhunjhunu police.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pocso-court-awards-death-to-convict-for-raping-minor/articleshow/81558001.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Kochi||Quarries: Kerala HC junks pleas against distance rules||KOCHI: The high court has dismissed a total of 18 appeals, including one by the state government, challenging a single bench’s order on distance-rule for quarrying near residential units. The decision by a division bench led by Chief Justice S Manikumar came while considering appeals alleging that the single bench’s order to follow a National Green Tribunal (NGT) directive, for increasing the distance from residential units to 200 metres, for quarries with expired permits would result in quarry operations coming to a standstill as licences cannot be renewed. The single bench had in December allowed a stay on the NGT directive only for quarries with existing permits. Government had contended before the single bench that quarries are being allowed to operate 50 metres away from residential buildings considering the topography of the state and the density of population. Through the order of January last year, the single bench had set aside the NGT’s directive, which increased the distance-rule from 50 metres to 200 metres, and had directed for conducting a fresh hearing involving the parties, including quarry operators. Such a directive was issued by the single bench after quarry operators contended at the high court that the NGT directive was issued without hearing them. However, the single bench had also directed that the stay issued on NGT directive in the case of quarries with existing permits would continue until the matter is disposed by NGT, leaving quarries with expired permits to face the new distance norm. The order for increasing distance rule was issued by NGT after treating as a petition a representation sent to the Prime Minister, with a copy to NGT chairman, complaining about inadequate distance to prevent pollution from quarrying at Konnakkalkadavu in Palakkad district. Central Pollution Control Board had filed a report before the NGT suggesting a distance-criteria of 100 metres when blasting is not involved and 200 metres when blasting is involved from residential buildings and other sites with human inhabitation. State Pollution Control Board had filed a report stating that the existing 50-metre rule is sufficient. Accepting the report filed by Central Pollution Control Board, NGT had ordered for implementing the distance criteria mentioned in the report in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/quarries-hc-junks-pleas-against-distance-rules/articleshow/81557064.cms||---

The police registered an FIR and arrested the suspect within a few hours of the crime. According to police, they received information on Wednesday morning around 6:30am that a blood-stained body was lying on the temple premises. A police team reached the spot and launched a probe. Preliminary investigations revealed that a 29-year-old local youth, Jeetu, was spotted with the priest Shiv Giri the night before the crime. Police arrested the suspect. During interrogation, he confessed to have killed the priest and told police that after consuming liquor he and his accomplices had gone to the temple where Giri raised objections. This led to a heated argument and in a fit of rage, he hacked Giri with an axe. SP (city) Botre Rohan Pramod said that the axe has been recovered from the crime spot and the body has been sent for post-mortem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/sadhu-hacked-to-death-inside-temple-in-agra/articleshow/81555727.cms||---
---||Amaravati||CID searches P Narayana’s house in Amaravati case||VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh police’s crime investigation department (CID) on Wednesday carried out searches on the residences and institutions of former minister and TDP leader P Narayana in connection with the alleged land scam in Amaravati. It also served a notice to the TDP leader to appear before CID regional office in Vijayawada on March 22. As CID could not find Narayana at his homes in Hyderabad and Nellore, it handed over the summons to his wife Ramadevi. The notice relates to alleged irregularities in assigned land parcels in Amaravati. Ex-AP CM N Chandrababu Naidu is accused number 1 and Narayana accused number 2. Sources said the CID teams searched the former municipal administration minister’s institutions and residences after getting information that he was there. But after not finding him there, the team then took an acknowledgement from his wife and also a declaration that Narayana will be presenting himself before the investigating officer on March 22. The FIR against the TDP chief Naidu and Narayana was registered on March 12 based on a complaint given by YSRC MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy on February 25, alleging irregularities in the assigned lands in Amaravati. CID officials also pointed that a notice under Section 160 of CrPC was issued to Ramakrishna Reddy asking him to present any evidence he possesses on the allegations he had made. “It is only a procedural aspect and the CID did not conduct any raids as such. We went there to know if the former minister was present at any of his offices across Vijayawada, Hyderabad and Nellore,” a senior CID official said. Ramakrishna, in his complaint, stated that he had received representation from a few residents of his constituency that “some influential persons of the then government cheated them by taking away their lands illegally”. The FIR states that the complainant (Ramakrishna) had verified the government orders issued by the then government and found several irregularities committed by the accused which caused ‘irreparable loss’ to SC and ST community and weaker sections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/cid-searches-narayanas-house-in-amaravati-case/articleshow/81559590.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

---||Nagpur||Repeat Covid infections rare, says Lancet study||Nagpur: The first large-scale study of Covid-19 reinfections published in The Lancet finds that repeat infections are rare but more common for those above the age of 65. The research note added that most people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least six months. The authors of the new study analysed data collected as part of Denmark’s national Covid-19 testing strategy through which more than two-thirds of the population (4 million) were tested in 2020. Dr Steen Ethelberg, from the Statens Serum Institut, Denmark, said, “Reinfection with Covid-19 is rare in younger, healthy people but the elderly are at greater risk of catching it again.” The study advocates strict adherence to safety protocols for senior citizens who had already been infected. “Since older people are also more likely to experience severe disease symptoms, and sadly die, our findings make it clear how important it is to implement policies to protect the elderly during the pandemic,” said Dr Ethelberg. Authors of the study found no evidence that protection against reinfection declined within a six-month follow-up period. Dr Daniela Michlmayr, also from the Staten Serum Institut, Denmark, said “The closely related coronaviruses SARS and MERS have both been shown to confer immune protection against reinfection lasting up to three years, but ongoing analysis of Covid-19 is needed to understand its long-term effects on patients’ chances of becoming infected again.” Large-scale assessment of reinfection rates in Denmark in 2020 confirms that only a small proportion of people (0.65%) returned a positive PCR test twice. However, while prior infection gave those under the age of 65 years around 80% protection against reinfection, for people aged 65 and older it conferred only 47% protection, indicating that they are more likely to catch Covid-19 again. The study also suggests that people should get vaccinated even if they have had the infection. In a linked comment to the above research, professors Rosemary J Boyton and Daniel M Altmann, from Imperial College London, UK, said “These data are all confirmation that for SARS-CoV-2, the hope of protective immunity through natural infections might not be within our reach and a global vaccination programme with high efficacy vaccines is the enduring solution.” Dr Sanjay Marathe, a leading expert on vaccinology agrees, saying, “Through vaccination you are guaranteed a high rate of protection and even if reinfection happens, it won’t be of a severe nature. Also people must not fret about which variants are covered by their vaccine, instead think of protecting yourself from the original strain first. Whenever we reach herd immunity level through vaccination, the virus will ultimately die off.” The study authors clarified that their research “focused on the original COVID-19 strain and made no assessment of variants”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/repeat-covid-infections-rare-says-lancet-study/articleshow/81557058.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The claim was denied because the husband had not informed the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) while renewing his insurance policy that he was undergoing a treatment for AIDS. Though his death occurred due to an accident and the insurance plan had accident benefit policy included, the widow was refused the claim because of suppression of material. The case belonged to Patan district. The insured man had the policy since 2007 and got it renewed regularly. On May 8, 2012, he fell from the stairs and died. His widow claimed the insurance amount but the insurance company did not respond. When she sought information under the RTI Act, the insurer revealed her husband had been an AIDS patient since February 2010. He had not revealed the disease during renewal of his insurance policy in 2011. The widow won a consumer forum order in her favour in 2014. But the insurance company filed an appeal in the commission, which has quashed the forum’s order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/insurance-denied-for-hiding-aids/articleshow/81576601.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray asked me to reinstate Sachin Waze in force when I was CM: Devendra Fadnavis||NEW DELHI: Citing details of the case of suspended Mumbai police officer Sachin Waze planting explosives outside the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani and the suspected murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran, former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday demanded that the investigation into the sensational plot should look at political patronage for Waze and sacked Mumbai police chief Parambir Singh. Asserting that the NIA should also take over the probe into the suspected murder of Hiran since it was linked to the plot to plant explosives outside Ambani’s residence, Fadnavis, leader of opposition in Maharashtra, said the probe should cover the role of senior politicians who got Waze reinstated even when the suspended API was being prosecuted for the alleged custodial death of terror suspect Khawaja Yunus. Fadnavis, whose sensational statement on the floor of Maharashtra assembly brought Waze under the scanner in the Antilia plot, said Waze and Parambir Singh were just pawns in a larger game, saying that he, as CM, was sought to be pressured into reinstating the controversial API. Fadnavis said that when he was chief minister, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray had personally asked to reinstate Waze. “I still remember, Uddhavji had telephoned me in 2018. He had asked if it is possible to reinstate Waze. Thackeray’s call was followed by a personal visit of a few senior Shiv Sena cabinet members. Then, I had specifically told them that it was not possible on the grounds that Waze was suspended following a high court order and that without approval of the high court, if we reinstate him, it will amount to contempt of court,” Fadnavis said. A 1990 batch officer of the state cadre, Waze was suspended in 2004 over his role in the custodial death of a 2002 Ghatkopar blast suspect Khwaja Yunus and was reinstated after the MVA government under Uddhav Thackeray took over in 2019. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut challenged Fadnavis to prove his claims. “There were many serious incidents during the BJP rule, but we have not intervened anywhere. To probe a case is the right of the state police,” he said. Raut clarified that the state government had transferred a few senior IPS officers, including Parambir Singh, on moral grounds. “No one will and should support whatever happened in the last 10-15 days. Both state ATS and Centre-controlled NIA are probing the gelatine vehicle case. It will be better to speak about it only after both probes get finished and the report comes out,” said the Sena leader. He also said that Fadnavis, a former chief minister and home minister, should not demoralise the Maharashtra police. Sena’s chief spokesperson also reiterated that the Sachin Waze episode would not be a threat to the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/uddhav-asked-me-to-reinstate-waze-in-force-when-i-was-cm-fadnavis/articleshow/81558022.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Stopping students from writing exams may cost a school its affiliation: Edu dept||Dehradun: The state education department on Wednesday issued an order stating schools that disallow students from writing exams over non-payment of fees will be prosecuted by the department, adding that their affiliation might be cancelled. The order follows several complaints from parents of children in private schools about them being forced to pay the entire fees before a child is allowed to take his or her exam. In some cases, parents of private school students offered to pay the fees in installments but were allegedly asked to foot the entire amount before the start of exams. “Schools cannot disallow students from writing their exams if the entire fees hasn’t been paid. The Uttarakhand HC has also ordered against such unethical practices. Many private schools are taking advantage of parents’ helpless situation. We will raise the issue with the district administration as well,” said Arif Khan, president of the National Association for Parents and Students’ Rights. The education department seconded the parents’ views. Asha Rani Painuly, chief education officer (Dehradun), said, “The issue of fees should be solved by both parents and schools through discussion. Parents paying the fees through installments or in some other mode should not be an issue. However, withholding children from giving their exams over non-payment of fees is illegal.

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, M R Shah and Sanjiv Khanna said that once a stay order is passed, it continues for years due to pendency of cases and by the time the stay is vacated, evidence is lost. "Such orders should be passed in rarest of rare cases and HCs should exercise its power in extraordinary cases," the bench said while hearing an appeal against a stay order passed by the Bombay High Court. The bench, however, said it is also necessary that the high courts have power to pass such orders to prevent misuse of the criminal justice system by people who file frivolous complaints. "At the same time we do not want to deprive the high courts of such power and the HC power must be preserved. It is a hard reality that the criminal justice system is getting misused," the bench said while pointing out that criminal cases are being filed in cases which are civil in nature. It said a balance has to be maintained between the right of the accused and fair criminal proceedings. The apex court has repeatedly held that any stay on criminal and civil proceedings will not continue beyond six months and the trial court can proceed in the case without waiting for approval from higher courts if the stay is not extended. The SC had passed a verdict in 2018 in which it had ruled that a stay on proceedings must not exceed six months. In a bid to ensure speedy justice and discourage delaying tactics adopted by the accused, the SC had ruled that lower courts could proceed after a six-month period, preventing the accused from dragging on the trial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hcs-should-stay-proceedings-in-criminal-cases-only-in-extraordinary-situations-sc/articleshow/81560406.cms||---

Releasing the group’s manifesto on Wednesday, former mayor and sitting corporator Surendra Furtado said these would be done within three months of their panel assuming office, as they will have to be passed at two CCP meetings. “House tax in Panaji is very high. We will reduce it by 50% and provide relief to all Ponjekars. There will be a complete waiver for signboard tax to promote small business, like small retail shops, milk shops, pharmacies and those who have signboards of their names. Any signboards of companies will be charged,” Furtado said. An app will help identify CCP voters and exempt them from parking fees. “All other vehicles, tourist taxis, buses, and people from outside Panaji will be charged,” he said. The panel also assured 24x7 electric public transport service, including hop-on-hop-off buses to reduce pollution in the city. The panel hit out at the Monserrate panel saying it wasn’t a BJP panel, but a ‘Babush-Jennifer’ panel, referring to the husband-wife duo both of whom are now MLAs of BJP. The panel, which has four advocates, two engineers, a teacher and an RTI activist besides others, appealed to the youth not to fall prey to assurances of the Panaji MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate panel—supported by BJP—of providing government jobs. No elections in any municipality must be fought on party lines, the panel said, adding that they were Panaji citizens from Congress, BJP and AAP, who came together under one panel to “save Panaji and have better quality of life”. “For 15-20 years, we have seen the Babush Monserrate panel. He did less work and more politics. He became MLA, PDA chairman, made his wife MLA and now a minister, made Uday Madkaikar mayor and sidelined the citizens of Panaji. Instead of solving issues in the city, when the municipality became a corporation, the problems have gone from bad to worse—parking, garbage, roads, flooding, everything,” AAP’s Valmiki Naik told reporters. Furtado said the panel has the support of 2,000 BJP karyakartas. Box ‘Casino licences not with CCP’ When asked about the offshore casinos, Surendra Furtado said, “CCP gives trade licences only for offices on land and not casinos in the water. Only the government of Goa can do this and they’ve been extending this every six months.” When asked for the panel’s stand he said, “Nobody, none of the Panjimites want casinos because of traffic congestion. If you go to St Tome and Fontainhas, you don’t get parking because of tourist taxis. Panjimites don’t get to park,” Furtado said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-free-parking-50-cut-in-house-tax-we-ponjekars-woo-panjim-voters/articleshow/81558036.cms||---

Justice Ashok Menon granted anticipatory bails to Dhanesh Prabhakaran, 38, of Kodussery near Vattaparambu, Arun Aravind, 32, of Vattapparambu near Karippassery, Sujay Subrahmanian, 39, of Vattaparambu, and Lenin TA, 38, of Thrikkalloor Parambu near Kurumassery after considering a petition filed by them. It is alleged by prosecution that the applicants gave a notice prepared on the letter head of ‘Hindu Aikyavedi’ to Mithun, an employee of Modi Bakery at Kurumassery junction, precluding the bakery from exhibiting a ‘halal’ sticker. If the sticker is not removed within seven days, the bakery would be boycotted and protests would be organized, it was threatened. A case under sections 153 (provocation to create riot) and 506 IPC (threatening) was registered by Chengamanad police against the applicants on a complaint filed by the bakery owner Joy of Thumbanassery in Mala. In the pre-arrest bail plea, it was stated that there are only seven Muslim families among a population of 36,000 in Parakadavu panchayat, where the bakery is situated and that the bakery cannot force halal food on Hindus residing in the area. The bakery had immediately removed the sticker and the case was registered at the instance of CPM and SDPI, it was contended. Now, sections 153A (promoting religious enmity) and 295A (act intended to outrage religious feelings) of IPC are intended to be incorporated, the petition said. In the judgment, the court said offences under sections 153 and 506 are bailable and pre-arrest bail plea is not maintainable. Senior public prosecutor Santhosh Peter does not deny the possibility of sections 153A and 295A being incorporated, the judgment said. A reading of the FIR does not indicate that the applicants committed an act that would fall under sections 153A or 295A, the court said. “Nothing was done by them to promote hatred between two groups,” the order said. The complainant informed the court that he has no objection in granting anticipatory bails to the applicants. Finding the apprehension of arrest expressed by the applicants as reasonable, the court granted anticipatory bails to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-hindu-aikyavedi-activists/articleshow/81557112.cms||---

The civic body has floated a request for proposal (RFP) to appoint a private agency to develop, finance, operate and maintain the park.The memorial dedicated to Dadasaheb Phalke, considered the father of Indian cinema, has been in shambles for many years. It was constructed in 2001. Initially, it got a good number of visitors, but people slowly stopped going to the site due to the negligence of the municipal corporation. Now, the NMC has decided to renovate the Phalke memorial.“We want to develop the Dadasaheb Phalke memorial park to attract more tourist.We want to bring back the glory of the park,” said mayor Satish Kulkarni.“Moreover, the NMC will have not to spend any money as the park will be developed on a PPP basis. The NMC will also get a part of the income generated after the renovation of the park,” said the mayor.“At present, NMC is spending around Rs 1 crore every year to maintain the park. The civic body will also save these expenses,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-to-renovate-phalke-memorial-on-ppp-basis/articleshow/81554959.cms||Tushar Pawar

Accused Elvis Owie (31) was nabbed from Mumbai after the cops tracked him down through the bank account number. The police said that he posed as a trader and duped Mayank Shah by promising to deliver him chemicals.According to cybercrime officials, Shah, a trader, had received an email on December 11, 2020 wherein the sender wrote that he wants to buy a chemical for cancer and neurological treatment from India. The next day Shah again got an email asking him to get quotation from Archana Enterprises and send it to the buyer.Shah sent quotation following which he got an email from Tikomed AB Company to place order for the chemical. Shah then transferred Rs 89,000 to Archana Enterprises bank account for getting sample of the chemical. The complainant got sample material following which he placed bigger order and transferred Rs 22.67 lakh in three separate instalments to Archana Enterprises.Shah got 10 litres of chemicals but expressed doubts over its authenticity before the police. After the WhatsApp number on which Shah was in touch with the accused was blocked and he also didn’t get any reply on the email id, Shah approached the cops.“We tracked the accused on the basis of bank account number and other technical sources. We are questioning the accused and trying to ascertain if there are any other persons involved in the racket,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime).Investigating officials said that Owie may have been involved in similar crimes in the past. “Many of them now operate individually from different cities,” Jadeja added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/nigerian-arrested-for-duping-chemical-trader-of-rs-22-lakh/articleshow/81555885.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Land in the twin villages of Dahikute and Boriambedari in Malegaon taluka was to be brought under irrigation through minor irrigation projects. But only 500 hectare, against an estimated 1,550 hectare, was brought under irrigation.“As per the policies of the central and state governments, the implementation of government schemes in the agricultural sector will now be done through farmer producer companies. Therefore, farmers should take the initiative to set up the farmer producer companies,” the minister said. “In order to bring more land under cultivation, we have decided to implement the developmental works through the FPCa as the government is providing various incentives for the same. We have asked the farmers to come together for a common goal,” said Bhuse.The minister also pointed out that since 30% of the agriculture schemes were reserved for women farmers, all the farmers who can claim benefits of this irrigation project should ensure the names of women on the land Record of Rights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/agri-minister-bhuse-seeks-to-promote-irrigation-via-fpcs/articleshow/81554967.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Shashi Tharoor seeks discharge from Sunanda Pushkar case||NEW DELHI: Shashi Tharoor’s counsel on Wednesday argued that no criminal case was established against Tharoor in the death of his wife Sunanda Pushkar. Pushkar was found dead on the evening of January 17, 2014. Though it was a murder probe with the FIR registered under IPC Section 302 (murder), on May 28, police charged Tharoor under sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and 498A (cruelty by husband) of the Indian Penal Code. On Wednesday, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa made the submissions before special judge Geetanjli Goel while seeking his client’s discharge in the case. Pahwa argued that numerous reports of the medical board comprising renowned doctors, besides the forensic reports of various laboratories and the psychological autopsy report conducted by experts had ruled out the death to be homicide or suicide. According to the submissions, the same reports consider the death to be accidental. “When the suicide is not established, where is the question of abetment to suicide. The investigating officer relies upon material which exonerates Dr Tharoor from all charges,” Pahwa submitted. The court was also informed that in the present case, neither had anyone filed a complaint nor given any statement alleging cruelty against Pushkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tharoor-seeks-discharge-from-sunanda-pushkar-case/articleshow/81557117.cms||---
---||Goa||Former Economic Development Corporation MD Ramanamurthy to be new state election commissioner||PANAJI: Former water resources department secretary and managing director of Economic Development Corporation (EDC) W V Ramanamurthy will be appointed as the Goa state  commissioner (SEC). “Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari has granted approval to appoint Ramanamurthy as the SEC. He will assume office on Thursday,” chief minister Pramod Sawant told TOI. Ramanamurthy succeeds law secretary Choka Ram Garg as the SEC after the Supreme Court passed strictures against the state government for giving the charge of the poll body to a serving bureaucrat. Ramanamurthy was in the Goa administration for many years as a GCS officer before he was elevated to the IAS cadre a decade ago. Though the state government had selected former joint chief electoral officer Narayan Navti as the SEC, he refused to take up the job as he did not fit the criteria of having served for 20 years in the Goa Civil Service (GCS) cadre. Sources said once a new SEC is appointed, the date for elections in the five municipalities will be decided. On March 12, a Supreme Court bench of justices R F Nariman, B R Gavai and Hrishikesh Roy rapped the Goa government for giving additional charge of the SEC to its law secretary, and said the decision “made a mockery of the constitutional mandate that state ECs must be truly independent bodies”. The Supreme Court also upheld the Bombay high court verdict that reservation to wards in five municipal councils were not as per the Constitution and the law and the state should rework the quotas and then conduct the polls. The apex court has set April 30 as the deadline for completion of the entire election process to these five municipal councils. The other six municipal councils and the CCP will go to polls on March 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/former-edc-md-ramanamurthy-to-be-new-sec/articleshow/81558039.cms||---

Speaking to TOI, 20-year-old new mother Lalita Singh said that it was a quick delivery and that the child was born just half an hour before the flight landed at Jaipur airport. She was travelling with her husband and checked into a private hospital in the city and later went home. Speaking about the unexpected birth, she said, “After boarding the flight, I started bleeding slightly and my water bag broke. I was in pain and informed the crew who suggested that I try walking a bit. I was in my eighth month, so the baby is one month premature.” The couple had boarded the flight at around 5.45am from Bengaluru and landed at Jaipur around 8am with a new family member. “The doctor who helped me deliver asked me to relax and though there was pain, it did not last. Before we landed, our son was born at 7.30 am. It was a normal delivery and this is my first child,” she said. Lalita's husband worked as an autorickshaw driver in Bengaluru and the couple had initially booked a flight scheduled later this month. But they had to travel earlier than planned due to a family emergency. “There was a family issue, so we decided to come earlier than planned and are heading to Beawar where my family stays. After five days, we will hold a ceremony to give the baby his name,” she said. Operator IndiGo also released a statement which said, “The baby was delivered with the help of IndiGo crew, effectively assisted by Dr Subahana Nazir, travelling with us on the same flight. Jaipur airport was immediately informed to arrange for a doctor and an ambulance on arrival. Both the baby and mother are stable... Great teamwork by all our staff concerned.” While the official statement by the airline claimed the baby was a girl, the mother said she had delivered a boy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/woman-delivers-a-boy-mid-air-on-jaipur-flight/articleshow/81558046.cms||---

Two offences have been registered with the Chakan police. An officer from the Chakan police said an employee of the Kharabwadi warehouse stated in his complaint that a company manufacturing auto components had stored spares worth Rs3 lakh with them. In the early hours of Monday, the thieves entered the warehouse by cutting the grilles on a window and decamped with the boxes containing the spares. In the other case, the burglars entered the private company’s premises in Chakan by breaking the locks on the main gate and made off with steel, worth Rs2 lakh, kept there for the construction of a shed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/spare-parts-steel-stolen-in-chakan/articleshow/81557102.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Day 3 of curbs: Man booked, old couple driven to hospital by cops||Nagpur: Even while enforcing Covid restrictions strictly, the city police displayed their humane side. On Residency Road in Sadar on Wednesday, they booked a motorist but ensured the senior citizens accompanying him reached their destination — a hospital in this case. On Day 3 of the extended Covid-19 restrictions in city, police deputy commissioner (DCP) Vinita Sahu and her staff detained a youngster driving a car bearing the registration number MH 40 BJ 1125 for willingly obstructing public servants from performing their duties, when they were staffing a checkpoint on Residency Road. Cops were stopping motorists at the checkpoint and asking why they were on the streets. They stopped a young man driving a car in which two senior citizens were seated. The man started quarrelling with the cops and questioned the DCP as to why she did not take action against a lady who was travelling with a child in an auto rickshaw. When TOI asked the DCP why the youth was punished, she said he didn't cooperate with cops when they asked him to show his documents. “I told him we are asking everyone to show their documents (including the lady he mentioned) and to tell us why they are out on the streets. The lady did not argue with us; she promptly showed us a hospital file which my staff and I verified and let her go, along with her child in the autorickshaw,” Sahu explained. But the youth driving the car still did not cooperate, she added. “He picked up an argument and hence I asked my staff to register an offence under Section 186 of the Indian Penal Code, and told him we can even apply Section 353 if the offence is of aggravated nature.” The DCP further said, “We are not inhuman. As police officers, we understand the needs of the public. It's only when people don't cooperate, become arrogant, start arguing and don't pay fines that we have to take such actions.” The youngster was taken to the police station but the DCP ensured that the senior citizens who were in the car reached the hospital, arranging for police personnel to drive their car there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/day-3-of-curbs-man-booked-old-couple-driven-to-hospital-by-cops/articleshow/81557121.cms||Ranjit Deshmukh

---||Hyderabad||Telangana will not pass resolution against 3 new farm laws: CM K Chandrasekhar Rao||HYDERABAD: Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Wednesday refused to pass a resolution against the new farm laws in the state assembly. The CM said the state government would like to maintain cordial relations with the Centre as both the state and Centre are elected governments but, at the same time, Telangana will not compromise on the interests of the state. “The government of India is ultimate in the country. Once the Centre enacts a law, no state government has the right to override it. Unfortunately, both Congress and the BJP governments have encroached upon the state government’s powers and even made laws on the issues that are in the concurrent list in the Constitution such as agriculture. This started during the Congress regime,” KCR said in the assembly. Responding to Congress floor leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka’s demand that the state government should pass a resolution on new agriculture laws in the assembly on the lines of Punjab, Kerala, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan governments, KCR claimed those resolutions were an ‘eyewash’. He said the TRS government had made its stand clear on the farm laws earlier. “Whatever we have to say, we said both in the assembly and outside the assembly earlier. Prime Minister Modi is of the view that the three new agriculture laws are beneficial to the farmers. Now the situation is totally uncertain and waiting for the court’s decision and Centre’s response on the issue,” he said. He assured that the state government would procure paddy by continuing market committees and provide minimum support price (MSP) to paddy. “Telangana was the only state in the country that procured all crops last year even when we were hit by Covid-19 and spent nearly Rs 50,000 crore,” he said. Explaining how the state was progressing in agriculture, especially in bringing one crore acres under cultivation, the CM said when Telangana was created, paddy cultivation in the state was just 12 lakh acres. Now it has risen to 58 lakh acres, while AP’s paddy cultivation stands at 20 lakh acres and 24 lakh acres in Tamil Nadu, he said. He also dismissed the comments of opposition leaders, including Bhatti Vikramarka, that the state government was in a debt trap, while giving a list of achievements of the government on subject such as irrigation, agriculture, power, loan waiver to farmers and Dharani. He attacked the earlier Congress government, alleging that the party ruined the state during its rule while claiming that the state progressed only in the past six years after TRS came to power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-will-not-pass-resolution-against-3-new-farm-laws-kcr/articleshow/81559604.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Chandigarh||After PM meet, Himachal, Punjab CMs say will impose Covid curbs strictly||CHANDIGARH/SHIMLA: Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and his Himachal Pradesh counterpart, Jai Ram Thakur, on Wednesday said they would be imposingg curbs to contain Covid-19 strictly in the wake of a resurgence in cases in the two neighbouring states. The statements came after they attended a Covid-19 review meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who expressed concern over the second wave of coronavirus. During the meeting, held via videoconferencing, Amarinder also urged the Centre to review its immunisation strategy to vaccinate all age groups in selected areas, while announcing a stricter policy to deal with the problem. After the meeting, in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram said the state government had decided to impose SOPs strictly at the Mairi Mela in Una district. He added he would request Amarinder to keep a tab on pilgrims visiting Himachal Pradesh from Punjab to check the spread of virus. During the meeting, Amarinder said state finance minister Manpreet Badal and SAD president Sukhbir Badal had also tested positive for coronavirus. “We are making a policy. We will get stricter from tomorrow,” he added. Active Covid cases in Punjab have surged to 12,616, with daily positivity rate climbing to over 5%. Amarinder called for occupation-based immunization for school and college students and teachers, judges, bus drivers and conductors, sarpanches, mayors, councillors, MLAs and MPs to pave the way for normalisation of crucial activities and check super-spreaders. He advocated early opening of courts to end the wait for justice for citizens, and also of schools and colleges to bridge the gap between poor and affluent families in terms of education. Amarinder blamed the surge in cases on fatigue/laxity in following COVID appropriate behaviours, large social and religious gatherings, and efforts at normalization such as opening of schools and colleges. Large positivity was seen in the state’s young population, he said. Amarinder suggested that any area where weekly testing showed doubling of positivity rates should immediately be considered for vaccination of all age groups. Later, while interacting with media, Thakur said the PM had asked all states to not only increase testing capacity, but also ensure strict implementation of various SOPs issued from time to time by the Centre. He said over 1.78 lakh people had been administered vaccination in the state, which was about 2.6% of the total population. He said the state government was also keeping an eye on the situation and appropriate steps were being taken accordingly. He said SOPs would be strictly followed during the celebration of fairs and other events. Apart from covering the entire population in selected areas, certain co-morbidity situations among those below 45 years, such as kidney and liver diseases, should also be covered across the state, Amarinder recommended, as Punjab continued to grapple with its second peak, which started from mid-February 2021. With the role of virus mutation still unclear, the CM underlined the need to strengthen viral sequencing, particularly in Punjab, “as over 50% positive cases now are below 40 years of age, and we need to urgently assess whether this is due to any variant”. The state Union home minister Amit Shah suggested that the state should increase the pace of vaccination and formulate a separate strategy for districts with higher caseload. Box: Demand to use relief fund Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh again reiterated the demand for permission by the Centre to use the state disaster relief fund, already available with the state, for Covid management. The Union ministry of home affairs may issue the approval urgently, he stressed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/after-pm-meet-himachal-punjab-cms-say-will-impose-covid-curbs-strictly/articleshow/81558037.cms||---

Over the past months, following a decline in patient numbers, these centres had either been shut completely or had been operating with minimal occupancy. Considering the spike in numbers, most wards have either reactivated them or will do so in the coming days. L Ward, for instance, will restart the centre at Municipal Capacity and Research (MCMCR) building at Chandivali, Powai, which was operational last year. This 300-bedded facility comprises both Covid Care Centres (CCC) 1 and 2. CCC1 are for suspected patients and high-risk contacts and CCC2 for mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. D Ward has taken over a hotel at Grant Road for quarantining patients in separate rooms. In the case of G-North Ward, the Vanita Samaj quarantine centre, which officials had planned to shut, will continue and with added capacity. Manish Walunju, assistant municipal commissioner of L Ward, said currently patients are sent to the project-affected persons buildings in Chembur taken over for quarantine. Now, the MCMCR facility will be started so that locals do not have to travel too far, he said. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, G-North Ward, said the Vanita Samaj facility operated as a 100-bedded centre. “Looking at the spike in cases we have decided to increase its capacity,” he said. Civic data shows 400 persons were in CCCI on February 22 and now there are 541. CCC2 had 91 people then and now have 273.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaibmc-starts-reactivating-hotels-halls-civic-buildings-as-quarantine-centres/articleshow/81557115.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Dehradun||#RippedJeans trends on Twitter amid row over U’khand CM’s comments on how women dress||DEHRADUN: Following Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat's comments on how women should dress to preserve the “sanctity” of home, Twitter was flooded with photos of women in ripped jeans. By Wednesday evening, a search for “ripped jeans” on the microblogging platform returned Rawat’s page as the top result. The newly appointed CM had a day before said ripped jeans leads to societal breakdown and is a result of the “bad example” parents set for children. TOI had reported the story on Tuesday. “While the western world follows us, doing yoga … covering their body properly, we run towards nudity,” Rawat had said at the inaugural session of the two-day workshop organised by the Uttarakhand State Commission for Protection of Child Rights in Dehradun. He had added that he was "shocked to meet a woman who ran an NGO wearing ripped jeans. “If this kind of woman goes out in the society to meet people and solve their problems, what kind of message are we giving out to the society, to our kids?" he asked the audience. What started out with two trends, #rippedjeans and #RippedJeansTwitter, with over 2,000 tweets by afternoon, soon put the spotlight on Rawat himself — at the time of filing this report, “Uttarakhand CM” was among the top 18 trending subjects in India with over 6,400 tweets.

Replying to a question in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, MoS (Home) G Kishan Reddy said incidents of shelling/ceasefire violations had risen to 5,133 in 2020 from 3,479 in 2019 and 2,140 in 2018. However, he added that there had been a significant decrease in terror incidents in the past three years, with terror attacks in J&K falling from 614 in 2018 and 594 in 2019 to 244 in 2020. Also till February 28 this year, 15 terror incidents had been recorded. While civilians killed were almost at the same level over the last three years, the number of fatal casualties among security forces fell from 91 in 2018 and 80 in 2019 to 62 in 2020. Four security personnel were martyred in the first two months of this year. Infiltration attempts into J&K fell to 99 in 2020 from 216 in 2019 and 328 in 2018. Till January 1 this year, not a single infiltration attempt was recorded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/658-ceasefire-violations-at-indo-pak-border-in-jan-feb-2021/articleshow/81560430.cms||---

On Wednesday, the third day of the drive, there was a drop of nearly 50% in the number of people who got vaccinated with the first dose compared with the past two days Only 2,583 people turned up for the shot on Wednesday as compared to 4,896 on Tuesday and 4,859 on Monday. The sharp dip on the third day has left health officials baffled. With Goa’s vaccination pace sluggish and having to cover nearly 3 lakh of the target group, the health department had initiated special vaccination camps for two days— Monday and Tuesday. Having set a target of vaccinating nearly 4,500 people every day, the health department decided to continue with the special camps. Chief minister Pramod Sawant also urged the elected representatives and politicians to make arrangements to ensure eligible people get the jab, while the Centre has been ensuring that there is no shortage of vaccines. The unsatisfactory response has worried health officials and if there is no improvement, they will not be able to finish vaccinating seniors and those with comorbidities by the end of next month. With time being a crucial factor, a health official said panchayat members should take the lead in galvanising people in their respective villages to come forward to take the vaccine. At a few places, panch members have approached health officers requesting them to conduct camps in their villages, the officer said. However, this will work only if 100 to 150 people show up to receive the shot, he said. “If only 30 to 40 people show up at the camp organised in a village, it will be a waste of our time and resources.” Since March 1, when the second phase of the vaccination drive started, only 44,703—38,490 senior citizens and 6,213 with comorbidities—have been vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/on-day-3-mega-vax-drive-sees-50-drop/articleshow/81558090.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Delhi||Delhi: Locked out & lucked out, migrants seek policy boost||NEW DELHI: Annapurna was a domestic worker in four houses in Delhi before last year’s Covid-19 lockdown and earned up to Rs 10,000 per month. Since then, her struggle to stay afloat went on for almost a year. “My husband lost his job as a waiter and we had to withdraw our 16-year-old son from the private school where he was studying. We were forced to vacate our rented room and move to a smaller place,” the 33-year-old said. After nearly a year, Annapurna finally found work last month but makes just Rs 2,000 in a month. Annapurna was at Jantar Mantar on Thursday alongside other house helps, migrant daily wage earners and commercial sex workers to demand a comprehensive policy for people like them. The protest was organised in the light of one year of the lockdown which exposed the harsh realities of the labour market. Working People’s Charter, an organisation working in the labour sector, collaborated with workers’ bodies on the day’s protest demanding that the Union and state governments immediately notify a migrant worker’s policy and recognise the invisible work of house helps and sex workers. “The states made promises of economic and employment benefits for migrant workers who returned home during the lockdown, but these are far from being met,” said a member of the organising team. “The central government had urged NITI Aayog to formulate policies and schemes to redress the plight of migrant workers, but not much progress has been made.” Keshav Ram, who trudged over 500km from Noida to Chhattarpur in Madhya Pradesh during the lockdown, said, “With 28 others, I walked for over 10 days to reach home when there was no work or food for us here. However, after staying home for three months, we returned to Noida for work. Before the lockdown, I used to work on all days, but now I am workless on at least three days of the week.” Labourer Ram Bharose similarly said, “I was working at a brick kiln in Punjab’s Sangrur but when the lockdown was imposed, my employer asked me to leave. He didn’t even pay me my dues of Rs 1.30 lakh. I returned home to Mohammadpur Jalta village in Uttarakhand, but couldn’t find work. So, I returned to Punjab to work in another brick kiln where again my wages were withheld. I reached Delhi in February and am looking for work.” Kusum of All India Network of Sex Workers demanded a one-time support of Rs 10,00 for all unorganised workers who are largely invisible in the labour market. Nirmal Agni, general secretary of Bandua Mukti Morcha which works with bonded labour, said that a migrant workers policy was the need of hour, but the state was not interested. “If something urgent isn't done, we will organise a massive protest on the eve of the lockdown’s anniversary,” Agni said.

---||Dehradun||Tribals cannot be denied fundamental rights: Uttarakhand HC||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday directed the state government to reconstitute the committee formed to look into the problems faced by the Van Gujjars living in the hill state. The HC has stated that the committee must have district magistrates as well as secretary social welfare department as its members. The panel has been directed to furnish its reports both before the state government as well as the HC every month for perusal. The court has further directed its registry to list this case every month. While issuing the orders, the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma noted that Uttarakhand has a large tribal population and it is the constitutional duty of the state to look after them as the state cannot ‘turn a Nelson’s eye’ towards this population. The court said that tribals have as many fundamental rights as any urban or rural population. The court added that the state is “duty bound” to have a tribal policy and take steps needed for their benefits while ensuring fundamental rights and basic facilities to them. The directions came while the court was hearing the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by an NGO called Think Act Rise Foundation (TARF). As reported by TOI, during the hearing of the same PIL, the division bench of the HC had, in August 2020, directed the state government to form a committee and look into the problems faced by the Van Gujjars. In compliance with the HC order, the state government had issued a memo in October 2020 and formed a committee. The panel members were — chief wildlife warden, director of Rajaji National Park, director of Wildlife Institute of India and an NGO nominated by the WWF. The committee was tasked with considering whether the Gujjars should be removed from the land and if yes, then what procedures need to be followed. Further, the committee was tasked with deliberating on the rights provided to them under the Forest Rights Act as well as the compensation needed to be given for their rehabilitation. However in February 2021, a letter was sent to the petitioner, asking him to raise his grievances under the Forest Rights Act 2006 before the DM or the social welfare department, neither of whom were the members of the committee. The petitioner brought the letter to the notice of the court after which it said that competent authorities were not part of the committee and that the officials were just passing the buck. The court said that there was a lacuna left by the state which cannot be appreciated. “The court has, therefore, said that the constitution of the committee is not up to the mark and issued the directions that the DM as well as secretary social welfare department should be its members. The court has further said the secretary district legal services authority should be a member and our suggestions should also be taken into account,” said Arjun Kasana, founder, TARF and petitioner in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nainital-hc-says-tribal-population-cannot-be-denied-fundamental-rights-directs-reconstitution-of-committee-to-look-into-the-problems-faced-by-van-gujjars/articleshow/81555891.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Pros aplenty have turned MLAs, few have played to their strengths||T’puram: Major political parties are flaunting academicians, professionals, postgraduates, and PhD holders as candidates like never before. Kerala has had a fair share of legislators with a remarkable stint in academics and professional careers in the past as well, but very few of them were given portfolios matching their areas of study and career. Dr A R Menon, a physician, became the first minister for health in the EMS ministry from 1957 to 1959. Since then, there were doctors in the assembly but they did not handle the Health portfolio. Dr M A Kuttappan was the minister for the welfare of backward and scheduled communities between 2001 and 2004 under A K Antony. Doctor-turned-politician M K Muneer handled public works and panchayats as a minister in two terms. Meanwhile, equipped with a PhD in Economics, Thomas Isaac held the finance portfolio. The same goes for legislators with technical backgrounds; TU Kuruvila, a diploma holder in Civil Engineering handled the portfolio of works for a year when V S Achuthanandan was the chief minister. With a diploma in aeronautical engineering, K P Mohanan handled Agriculture, Animal husbandry, printing and stationery in the Oommen Chandy ministry. Shibu Baby John, a mechanical engineer was the minister for labour between 2011 and 2016. Thomas Chandy, a diploma holder in Telecommunication was given the portfolio of transport in 2017. There were professors and principals in the assembly but not everyone made decisions as Education ministers. Prof Narayana Kurup was the minister for transport between 1977 and 1979, Prof K V Thomas handled fisheries, tourism and excise while Prof K A Mathew, a former principal was the minister for industries and forests in 1979 under C H Mohammed Koya. There were exceptions though; Retired professor C Raveendranath was given the education portfolio in the ministry of Pinarayi Vijayan. The state's first Minister for Education, Prof Joseph Mundassery is credited with many revolutionary legislations in the field. As for lawyers, though the assembly has had a good percentage of lawyers few have become law ministers. K Chandrasekharan, a law graduate from Madras Law college was the minister for law and revenue in the ministry of Pattom Thanu Pillai between 1960 and 1962. He also became the minister for education and law between 1987 and 1991 in the Nayanar ministry. K R Gowri Amma, a lawyer by profession, handled various portfolios in four ministries but held the portfolio of law only once -- from 1967 to 1969 in the fourth ministry headed by EMS. Justice Krishna Iyer handled law and irrigation between 1957 and 1959 in the first ministry of EMS. T A Thomman who had enrolled as an advocate at Pala, also handled Law and Revenue in the ministry headed by R Sankar in 1964. K M Mani was another lawyer who got the law portfolio even as he handled revenue, home, finance and irrigation in different ministries. Neelalohithadasan Nadar, a law graduate, held the portfolio of law, power, irrigation and labour in 1979. M Vijayakumar handled law, parliamentary affairs and ports between 2006 and 2011. P Sankaran and V S Sivakumar were lawyers who became health ministers. There had also been instances where ministers rose above portfolios and professions. E Chandrasekharan, who practiced as a lawyer till 1970 introduced the concept of Maveli stores as minister for food and civil supplies. P K Kunju pioneered the introduction of lottery in the state when he held Finance in the EMS ministry (1967-69).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pros-aplenty-have-turned-mlas-few-have-played-to-their-strengths/articleshow/81572041.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Nashik||MSEDCL provides 2,873 connections to farmers||Nashik The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited ( MSEDCL), Nashik zone, has provided 2,873 power connections to the farmers under the state government’s Mahakrushi Urja Abhiyaan, so far, said chief engineer Deepak Kumthekar. MSEDCL’s Nashik zone has provided power connection to the farmers who have been waiting for the connections post 2018. According to the scheme launched by the energy department of Maharashtra, all the farmers who have paid for their connections and whose connection is within 30m of the source will be given immediate power connections. The farmers from Ahmednagar Circle have been the biggest beneficiaries of the scheme as 1,774 have got the connections since they were within 30m distance from the source. In Nashik Circle, the MSEDCL has released 505 connections and in Malegaon Circle the connections issued stood at 255. Under the scheme, the farmers who are within the distance are provided with the connection immediately and the MSEDCL is also focusing on the enhancement of its infrastructure. Similarly, in cases where the distance is greater or the transformers do not support the system to accommodate the farmers, appropriate measures also being taken. Similarly, 339 other farmers have received the connections through the High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS) as they were far away from the source and hence the scheme, in which two connections per transformers are given, has been implemented there. A total of 1.53 lakh farmers have so far cleared Rs 119 crore due with the company. As many as 19,263 farmers in Nashik Circle cleared their dues of Rs 22.36 crore, 23,075 farmers in Malegaon Circle have cleared an outstanding amount of Rs 26.36 crore and 1.11 lakh farmers in Ahmednagar have cleared their dues worth Rs 70.07 crore. The response from the farmers is encouraging as this is helping the MSEDCL, which is recovering its dues, though slowly. Through the new policy adopted, 33% of the bills recovered will be spent on strengthening local infrastructure, another 33% to limited strengthen infrastructure in the district and the rest will be used by the company for its regular business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/msedcl-provides-2873-connections-to-farmers/articleshow/81554975.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Chandigarh||3 districts with highest cases poorest in contact tracing||Gurgaon: The three districts driving the current surge in Covid cases in Haryana — Karnal, Kurukshetra and Ambala — are also lagging behind in contact tracing. The average number of contacts traced for each Covid patient is 9.9 in Ambala, 10 in Kurukshetra and 10.1 in Karnal, lower than the state average of 10.8. These three districts account for 1,379 of the 3,212 active cases in the state — which comes to around 42%. While Karnal has 639 active cases, Kurukshetra has 453 and Ambala 287. A comparison of Haryana’s 22 districts till March 14 shows that Jind (6.5) is at the bottom of the contact tracing table, closely followed by Charkhi Dadri (7.1), Fatehabad (7.7), Mahendragarh (7.9) and Faridabad (8). Gurgaon has fared better and is among the top five districts — tracing 13 people for every Covid patient. Gurgaon currently has 583 active cases. The district’s average has improved since November last year, when it had been tracing only four contacts for each case. As of March 14, Gurgaon had completed tracing 59,726, or 100%, of its contacts. On Tuesday, it has 123 contacts, who are yet to be traced. Nuh, with an average of 19.5, has fared the best in terms of tracing contacts. It is followed by Palwal (14.8), Hisar (13.5), Gurgaon (13.3) and Kaithal (13.1). Of late, Haryana has been adding more than 400 cases on an average daily, and the bulk of it have been coming from Karnal, Kurukshetra, Panchkula, Ambala and Gurgaon. This sudden surge in cases has prompted the local administrations to intensify their contact tracing efforts. Yogesh Sharma, the chief medical officer of Karnal, the district with the highest number of active cases, said nearly 30% of the patients were schoolchildren. “Since March, we have reported 900 cases, of which, 260 are students of various schools. We have been tracing their contacts. It’s a difficult task. There are about 200 schools in Karnal and we have been sending our teams regularly for monitoring the students,” he said. Asked if the health department was contemplating closing schools in the wake of the surge in cases, Sharma said, “The government should analyse the situation and take a decision.” According to him, Karnal has been conducting 1,500 tests daily. Meanwhile, Gurgaon has been testing 3,500 samples daily. As part of surveillance, the district has upped efforts in monitoring travellers from other states, including Maharashtra and Kerala, where cases have been increasing recently. “Since Gurgaon is close to the Delhi airport, a large number of people who travel to different parts of the country stay in the city. This is one of the reasons the district is witnessing a rise in cases. It is also the hub of several multinationals, which is why commuting is a regular pattern here,” chief medical officer Virender Yadav said. Testing and tracing of contacts of patients is key to curbing the spread of the infection. If contacts are traced within days and their samples tested immediately, it helps the administration ensure timely treatment of patients and prevent them from getting critical. So far, Haryana has traced 2,73,435 contacts while 1,702 are pending. “We have already instructed districts like Faridabad, Karnal, Kurukshetra , Rewari and Ambala to strengthen contact tracing and carry out more testing,” said a senior health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/3-districts-with-highest-cases-poorest-in-contact-tracing/articleshow/81558056.cms||Ipsita Pati

SAD spokesperson and former minister Dr Daljit Singh Cheema asked the chief minister to tell the addresses where new medical colleges had been established at Mohali, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur and Malerkotla. “The Congress government announced the Mohali medical college in its very first budget in 2017-18, but even this project has not been taken up till now,” he added. The Akali leader said during the peak of the Covid pandemic in April last year, Punjab recorded the highest mortality rate of 6% in the country. “As many as 106 persons died on a single day on September 2 last year. Even the medical superintendent of Faridkot medical college resigned citing lack of infrastructure. All this happened due to the utter insensitivity of the government which refused to upgrade hospital infrastructure or increase the number of ICUs and ventilators, ambulances and PPE kits in time.” He questioned if the government had provided quality treatment to Covid patients, why did health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu choose to get treated in a private hospital when he was diagnosed with Covid-19. He said another Congressman and Shatrana MLA Nirmal Singh had virtually run away from the Patiala medical college and shifted to a private institution when he realized he was not getting adequate treatment. “We already know about the fate of Padma Shri Nirmal Singh Khalsa who passed away from Covid due to sheer negligence of the Punjab government,” he added. The SAD spokesperson said even when all this was going on, the Congress government made MBBS students the victim by increasing their fee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-attacks-cm-for-spending-crores-to-sell-lies/articleshow/81558087.cms||---

The decision comes after the Vatican announced that such marriages are a sin. According to church officials, the church got a clear vision about the issue after the Vatican’s announcement. The Vatican, on Monday, issued a detailed statement about such marriages and described it as a “sin”. “Blessings belong to the category of the sacramentals, whereby the Church “calls us to praise God, encourages us to implore his protection, and exhorts us to seek his mercy by our holiness of life”. In addition, they “have been established as a kind of imitation of the sacraments, blessings are signs above all of spiritual effects that are achieved through the Church’s intercession,” read the Vatican’s note. “The Vatican issued a document about same-sex marriages and it is applicable to Catholic Church in Kerala too. The church will not bless such marriages,” said KCBC deputy secretary Fr Jacob G Palakkappally. “We believe that marriage is a sacrament celebrated between a baptized man and a baptized woman. Same-sex marriage is not a sacrament. In foreign countries, same-sex marriages and relations have been reported and Vatican’s direction will be helpful to manage such issues in future,” he added. “The presence in such relationships of positive elements, which are in themselves to be valued and appreciated, cannot justify these relationships and render them legitimate objects of an ecclesial blessing, since the positive elements exist within the context of a union not ordered to the Creator’s plan,” Vatican’s note read. The Vatican note further stated that “since blessings on persons are in relationship with the sacraments, the blessing of homosexual unions cannot be considered licit. This is because they would constitute a certain imitation or analogue of the nuptial blessing invoked on the man and woman united in the sacrament of matrimony, while in fact there are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God’s plan for marriage and family”. “The Church recalls that God Himself never ceases to bless each of His pilgrim children in this world, because for Him we are more important than all of the sins that we can commit. But he does not and cannot bless sin. The Church does not have, and cannot have, the power to bless unions of persons of the same sex,” the note said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/catholic-church-in-kerala-not-to-bless-same-sex-unions/articleshow/81557135.cms||Sandeep Thomas

The MP also requested the health minister to sanction a medical college in Gurdaspur, a border district, under the Centre’s scheme where eligible district hospitals are upgraded to medical colleges. She requested the ministry to provide a genome sequencing lab in the state so that respective strains of the virus could be identified. Underscoring the need for Centre to allocate more funds to states to fight pandemic, the MP said, “Even though the proposed allocation at Rs 71,269 crore is 9% higher over the current year’s budget estimates, it is actually 9.6% lower than the revised estimates (RE) of the current year which stands at Rs 78,866 crore.” Addressing the House, she stated 4% increase proposed in outlay of the National Health Mission was grossly inadequate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/patiala-mp-seeks-rs-200-crore-from-centre-for-effective-covid-management-in-punjab/articleshow/81558099.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Washing his hands off the issue, Sawant put the ball in the tourists’ court, saying they “must take measures at public places”. After a virtual meeting with PM Narendra Modi and other CMs, Sawant said that the state has decided to increase testing in view of the rise in infections. “I had a discussion with health minister Vishwajit Rane,” he said. “At least for now, we will not impose janata curfew nor will we have any ban, but will increase testing in a big way. No decision has been taken yet to have checks at border posts, but hotels must do thermal checking of their guests.” Sawant was replying to questions about what measures Goa government plans to take as infections in neighbouring states, especially Maharashtra, rise. If a tourist exhibits symptoms of Covid-19, the hotel in question should direct him to a testing facility, he said. The CM also appealed to the people to get tested without delay even if they have the mildest symptoms. The directorate of health services currently conducts 1,600-1,700 tests a day, and rarely crosses the 2,000-mark. On Tuesday, Goa reported four deaths and 89 cases. Calling this “a matter of concern”, Sawant said that the administration will be issued directions to penalise people not wearing masks in public. “This has also been seen at meetings, where people neither wear masks nor use sanitisers. People have to compulsorily wear masks when in public,” he said. “People must home isolate if tested positive, or get hospitalised if the condition warrants,” he said, adding that the DHS still provides home isolation kits to those who test positive. Sawant said that Modi has issued general directions to all states to take added measures against the spread of the virus. He said the PM wants testing to be increased, but states have been asked to take decisions considering their situations. “If needed, states could have mini-containment zones, the PM told us,” Sawant said. The PM’s review meeting touched upon two points — why Covid cases are going up in some states, and how the vaccination drive has been progressing. The meeting also saw discussion on wastage of vaccines, and the extent of participation by private hospitals in vaccination programmes. Modi discussed how future vaccination programmes should be carried out, and how to fast-track them. “The PM said that people should not fail to take precautions even after getting the vaccine,” Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-covid-cases-spike-nationally-sawant-says-no-entry-checks-for-now/articleshow/81558105.cms||---

Those selling used appliances, gadgets and vehicles said businesses flourished as residents opted for cheaper alternatives instead of buying brand new products. While used phones, laptops and televisions were the most sought after – given that people worked, studied and sought entertainment from home -- sale of used cars and two-wheelers went up once the lockdown was lifted. Chennai Used Car Dealers Welfare Association said around 800 second hand cars were sold in the city and suburbs every month after restrictions over movement of vehicles were gradually relaxed in August. It was nearly 27% more on a monthly basis compared to pre-Covid times, the association said. Old Two Wheelers Owners and Auto Consultants Association said the sales of used two-wheelers almost doubled between February 2020 and February 2021. Dealers said many residents who had plans to buy new cars settled for used vehicles. Vanagaram resident B Vinoth Kumar, a businessman, said he was planning to buy a new SUV last April but had to be content with a used car. “I was going through a financial crunch and so I chose a seven-year-old used car as its price was one-third of a new vehicle,” he said. Chennai Used Car Dealers Welfare Association president Ramesh Kumar said almost 50% of customers who bought pre-owned cars wanted a new vehicle but opted for a used one as their finances were hit by the pandemic. Online classifieds platform Quikr said pre-owned phones, laptops, sofa sets, gaming consoles and digital cameras were among the second hand goods put on sale and searched by Chennai residents on QuikrBazaar between April 2020 and March 2021. “These products were 20%-30% cheaper than new ones,” Vineet Sehgal, chief marketing officer of Quikr told TOI in an email. With summer almost here, the second hand air-conditioner market is seeing signs of revival. K Ramesh, vice-president of Tamil Nadu Air-condition, Refrigeration Engineers & Technicians Union affiliated to CITU, said the demand for second hand air-conditioners is rising. “It is obvious that people do not have adequate money to purchase new machines whose average prices have increased by `5,000 in the past one year. The second hand air-conditioner market was extremely dull since people always prefer new machines. But post Covid-19, the inquiries for these used air-conditioners has surged,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/covid-impact-residents-strappedfor-cash-plump-for-all-things-old/articleshow/81557138.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

In fact, the tally fell by around 500, as 8,445 vaccinations were reported from all centres in the city till 5pm. A day before, the civic body had announced 11 new centres at dispensaries and UPHCs. But it could manage to start only seven at Pardi, Khamla, Babulkheda, Sadar, Kapil Nagar, Nandanwan, and Manewada. The remaining vaccination centres at Indora, Hansapuri, Pande Layout and Mahal faced issues in creation of sites on the portal, and were not visible in the Co-Win app. The turnout at the seven centres too was low, with only 400 taking the jab. The most came to Khamla Ayurved dispensary, where 193 took the shots, while the lowest was at Sadar Diagnostics Center (7) among the newly started centres. Centre officials said they were hoping that the footfall would eventually pick up by evening but there was no drastic turnaround. In a video clip, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari advised people to get themselves registered online before visiting the inoculation centres to avoid waiting time and other problems. Civic officials also said the city would record a better tally in next few days as people are becoming cautious amid the rising cases. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said 68 vaccination sites are active as on Wednesday. “We shall reach 15,000 inoculations in next few days. People were not aware of the new sites while they were also not visible in the app,” he said. On the other hand, the district recorded a whopping 10,640 vaccinations at 79 sites in Nagpur rural and taluka places, as per the press note issued by the district information office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/new-vax-centres-get-poor-response-on-day-1/articleshow/81557140.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The HIMS project would target healthcare delivery and patient care services, hospital administration, budgeting and planning, supply chain management, back-end services, among others. The entire system will be on cloud and digitised, a statement from the CM office said. Delhi government will also be issuing health cards in the name of all the residents of Delhi. Once the cards are issued, these will be integrated with HIMS. “We need to ensure all the residents of Delhi are issued e-health cards. We will provide health cards to every household so that they can obtain hassle-free treatment,” Jain said. Under HIMS, various features such as a web portal, mobile application, etc. will be launched to store a database of the residents. “The foremost priority will be to have interactive features, such as having the latest contact information of the patient,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-expedite-plan-on-health-card-helpline/articleshow/81576637.cms||---

The announcement was made by Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani on Wednesday after a videoconference (VC) with PM Narendra Modi. The PM was appraised of steps taken by Gujarat to rein in the virus and the roadmap ahead. Along with Rupani, deputy CM Nitin Patel, chief secretary Anil Mukim, chief principal secretary to CM K Kailashnathan and other senior officers were present for the VC. “The CM said 22.15 lakh persons in Gujarat have had their first dose so far and 5.42 lakh the second dose. The daily capacity of Gujarat to vaccinate is 1.5 lakh, which would be doubled to 3 lakh,” said a senior official present. Rupani said at the VC that night curfew in four major cities of Gujarat –Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot – has been imposed from 10pm to 6am till March 31. Besides, screening of passengers at railway stations, airports and highways connecting Gujarat has also been ramped up including temperature checks and rapid antigen testing (RAT) of suspected cases. The state will adhere to the Government of India’s mantra ‘Davai bhi aur kadai bhi’ (medicine along with strong implementation of rules), the CM assured the PM. He added that surveillance and contact tracing has been intensified in municipal corporations and districts where there has been an increase in Covid-19cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/daily-vaccination-target-to-be-doubled-to-3l-cm-briefs-pm/articleshow/81557137.cms||---
---||Vadodara||AIMIM, independents snatch power from BJP||Vadodara: Independents snatched away power from the BJP in the Godhra municipality on Wednesday by ensuring that their candidates got elected as the president and vice president in the civic body. Despite having won 18 out of the 44 seats of the municipality, the best that the BJP could do was creating ruckus in the meeting of the elected wing of the municipality.The build up to the meeting was itself intense with both the camps — BJP on one side and AIMIM, independents as well as Congress on the other — leaving no stone unturned to ensure they got a majority. Independent corporator Sanjay Soni also approached the Gujarat high court to ensure that the president’s election was held peacefully. As a result, the meeting was videotaped and there was heavy police security.It transpired that out of 44 corporators, 43 had remained present. An independent corporator from the minority community who had earlier supported the BJP was absent. The BJP managed to get the support of an independent and reached figure of 19. But seven AIMIM and one Congress corporator along with 17 independents turned the tables on the saffron party. The alliance that won includes four independent members of the majority community even as all the other 20 are from the minority community.The alliance that toppled BJP put up Soni as the candidate for the president’s post as well as Akram Patel for the post of vice president. Both Soni and Patel are independent corporators. BJP members tried to create a ruckus in the meeting by insisting that police should leave the hall. They even tore some papers inside the hall.When the BJP did not put up any candidate against Soni and Patel, they were declared uncontested winners. After winning the polls, Soni said that the group would work for the development of Godhra without any partiality.AIMIM corporator Hanif Kalandar said that the party had offered unconditional support to anyone who promised development in all 11 wards of the town. “By Soni’s selection we want to send a signal that communal harmony prevails in the town,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/aimim-independents-snatch-power-from-bjp/articleshow/81555948.cms||---

Mussoorie MLA and cabinet minister Ganesh Joshi, in a video message, said, “I want to specify that no lockdown has been imposed in Mussoorie. People must not believe the rumours. Tourists are welcome to visit the town. All tourist places — including Kempty Falls, Buranskhanda, Sir George Everest House — are open,” Joshi said. Anuj Gupta, chairman of Mussoorie municipal council, in a facebook post, wrote that Mussoorie is safe and that there is no lockdown. “There are no Covid-19 cases in Mussoorie, the town is safe and there is no lockdown. Please should not pay heed to baseless rumours. We welcome all tourists to visit the town without any fear or risk of Covid-19,” Gupta wrote. Several hoteliers, Mussoorie Traders’ Association and residents also took to social media. Several posts were uploaded using hashtags #NolockdowninMussorie, #Mussoorieissafe and #Mussoorieisopen on Wednesday evening. It must be mentioned that rumours of lockdown in St. George’s College and nearby Barlowganj locality spread to various parts of the country through some news portals and social media on Sunday. Although the district administration clarified that only a micro containment zone had been created within the school campus. However, a number of tourists have cancelled their bookings in Mussoorie hotels since Sunday. “We have recorded around 10-20% cancellations of hotel bookings since Sunday. Future bookings and enquiries have also dried up,” said Sandeep Sahni, president of Hotels and Restaurant Association of Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mussoorie-residents-take-to-social-media-to-dismiss-rumours-of-lockdown-in-town/articleshow/81555932.cms||Anmol Jain
---||India||‘No provision of detention centre under CAA for illegal immigrants’||NEW DELHI: The home ministry on Wednesday said there is no provision of ‘detention centres’ under the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) or the National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC), though such ‘detention centres’ were set up by the state governments as per their requirements to detain illegal immigrants/foreigners who had completed their jail sentence and were awaiting deportation for want of travel papers. Replying to a question by TMC’s Derek O Brien, MoS (Home) Nityanand Rai said the Supreme Court had in an order dated February 28, 2012 directed that foreign nationals who had completed their sentence shall be released from jail immediately and be kept in an appropriate place with restricted movement pending their deportation/repatriation. MHA had on March 7, 2012 issued instructions to the state governments and UT administrations to comply with the apex court’s directions. “Detention centres are set up by state governments/Union Territory administrations as per their local requirements to detain illegal immigrants/foreigners, some of whom may have completed their sentence and their deportation to their native country may be pending for want of proper travel documents,” Rai said adding that the details of number of such detention centres set up by the state/UTs or the persons detained in these centres were not maintained centrally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-provision-of-detention-centre-under-caa-for-illegal-immigrants/articleshow/81560446.cms||---
---||Delhi||EDMC defends AAP councillor’s disqualification||New Delhi: East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has blamed suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain for failing to take approval of absence and “change in address” following his arrest in connection with the northeast Delhi riots last year. Defending its decision to disqualify the AAP corporator, EDMC cited Delhi Municipal Corporation Act to justify its penal action, which has now been stayed by Delhi High Court. “The petitioner was taken into police/judicial custody on March 5, 2020 for alleged involvement in a criminal case and, thus, there was a change in his address. However, the petitioner miserably failed to intimate the same to the corporation and further failed to seek approval of his absence under Section 33(2) of DMC Act,” the affidavit filed by EDMC through standing counsel Gaurang Kanth stated. Citing the proviso to point out that if a member didn’t attend three consecutive meetings, he suffered disqualification, EDMC argued that Hussain should have informed the civic body in case he was not in a position to attend a particular meeting. The corporation said the only thing Hussain was required to do is give a declaration. “He has to not only excuse himself from a particular meeting, but such excuse has to be sufficient since he is an elected member of the locality, bearing a huge responsibility and accountability towards the public at large. Normally, leave of absence in such cases should be obtained in advance. Even when a member is not able to give advance intimation of his absence with sufficient excuse, he is required to intimate about this immediately after the meeting. However, the petitioner failed to do the same,” added the affidavit. Last year, the court had put on hold EDMC’s August 26 disqualification decision on Hussain’s plea challenging it. His plea had argued that the EDMC decision was “arbitrary, illegal and against the principles of natural justice” and ought to be set aside. The petition also challenged EDMC’s letter dated August 20 proposing to “vacate his seat” as councillor for not attending the House meetings held in the months of January, February, June and July. Hussain’s plea stated that he had received no prior notice of the meetings, so he couldn’t move the court to seek permission for attending them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-defends-aap-councillors-disqualification/articleshow/81557171.cms||Abhinav Garg

The last time the cases were above 250 was in the second week of December 2020. Analysis of cases reveal that the city doubled its cases in eight days – from 123 on March 9 to 264 on March 17. For Surat, the period was even shorter at six days –from 149 on March 11 to 315 on March 17. In all, in eight days, the eight municipal corporations in Gujarat doubled its cases from 399 on March 9 to 819 on March 17. Ahmedabad remained on top in test positivity rate (TPR) at 3.5% - every 1,000 tests yielded 35 positive cases – compared to 30 in Vadodara, 28 in Rajkot and 20 in Surat. Surat remained on top in terms of tests conducted at 17,496, which accounted for about 30% of the state’s total tests.

However, the majority had mild symptoms and they recovered soon. Data from the directorate of health services (DHS) shows that as on October 31, 2020, about 1,835 Covid-positive pregnant mothers had delivered and of these, 245 newborns tested Covid positive. “Even now it remains around 13%. The trend is seen more in breastfeeding newborns or those sleeping with their mothers. But none of these children have turned very sick and therefore we are advising breastfeeding for all newborns,” said Dr Ajith S, head, gynaecology department, Government medical college, Kannur, who has been studying the Covid pattern in pregnant women and newborn in the state. The baby can be infected by two routes: across the placenta while the baby is still in the womb or after birth from direct contact. However, treating gynecologists said that it can’t be said with certainty whether Covid was transmitted from mother to the newborn in all cases. “We found that in a few centres here, the newborn getting infected was high as necessary precautions were not taken. If the mother has viremia, it can spread to the baby if there is close contact and necessary precautions are not taken,” said Dr V P Paily from Kerala Federation of Obstetricians and Gynaecology (KFOG). Current evidence suggests that the risk of a newborn getting Covid-19 from their mother is low, especially when the mother takes steps (such as wearing a mask and washing hands) to prevent spread before and during care of the newborn. Researchers say it’s rare for the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 to be transmitted from mother to infant before birth. In the initial stages of the infection, gynecologists discouraged breastfeeding in the state and at that time the number of babies testing positive was also very low. “But the stress to the mother when not allowing breastfeeding is much greater. Breast milk is known to be protective against numerous pathogens,” added Dr Ajith. Most studies have not found the Covid-19 virus in breast milk, but the milk has been found to contain an antibody to the Covid-19 virus in some studies. “If a newborn develops any health issues, it is key that families shouldn’t hide Covid infection history in the family. We have seen that often mothers are reluctant to reveal that they had Covid during pregnancy due to fear of getting stigmatized,” added Dr Suma Balan, pediatric rheumatologist, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/13-newborns-with-covid-hit-moms-tested-positive-in-state/articleshow/81557195.cms||Preetu Nair

Any such incident will result in the commissioner, or chairpersons or the controlling authority, in facing criminal charges and immediate arrest, the court said. The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy made the observation on Tuesday on a public interest writ petition moved by Safai Karmachari Andolan. The court then directed the state to file a detailed report by seeking a status report from each of the districts on the steps initiated to prevent manual scavenging. “Despite passing orders and filing detailed status reports till December 2019, the practice still prevails, and people are dying in pits,” the court said. “It is high time that the heads of corporations and municipalities are held personally liable for the deaths occurring within their territories and it must be made clear by the appropriate authorities,” the court said. According to the petitioner, as per the data collected by the National Commission for Safai Karamchari, since 2017, one sanitation worker has died every five days in India while cleaning sewers or septic tanks. The main cause of death among sewage cleaners is the depletion of oxygen and the presence of toxic gases, mostly hydrogen sulphide at the bottom of the septic tank, the petitioner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/manual-scavenging-deaths-officials-to-face-arrest-says-hc/articleshow/81557148.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Over 25 lakh people lost jobs due to dying rivers: Report||Kolkata: Riverine Bengal is fast losing its lifeline. More than 25 lakh people have lost livelihood because of the dying and dead rivers. On Wednesday, the victims of this worst environmental degradation staged a rally at Ramlila Maidan, Moulali, pointing that the issue has not featured in the manifesto of any political party in the poll-bound Bengal. The mass rally at Ramlila Maidan, organised by Sabuj Mancha, marked many firsts in poll-bound Bengal. The rally used sound-limiters with every sound-amplifier supplied and installed for free by Webel, a PSU. The waste generated at the rally was collected and disposed periodically. The generator used for the rally was run by clean fuel. “The geography of Bengal’s rivers has become history and we have lost biodiversity on a massive scale. The ground water recharge has been hampered to a great extent. Fishermen lost their livelihood like farmers. But the state administration and the Centre have remained indifferent to this issue,” said Naba Dutta of Sabuj Mancha. “We are not only demanding active intervention of the government to rejuvenate the dead rivers but also asking for a separate department that will work for the revival of rivers. Bengal has 56 rivers that flow across international borders. Moreover, it is very difficult to address a riverine issue. It ends up with ‘passing-the-buck’ games by different government departments like irrigation, water resources, forest, power and others,” said Jotirmoy Saraswati, a river activist and director of Sreema Mahila Samity. Sabuj Mancha has already started a movement, Nadi Panchayet (River Panchayat) with three-tier redressal system — river sabha at the grass root level, river panchayat and zila river sansad. “The ancient civilizations were born on the bank of rivers. The death of the rivers is ominously hinting at the complete destruction of human civilization,” said Tuhin Subhra Mandal, an active river activist from north Bengal. The rally demanded the constitution of a river commission by the government. The commission must have representations from the grassroot level stakeholders. The government must take a call on the revival and rejuvenation of dying or dead rivers. The riverine tract must be rescued from the illegal occupants. The orders of the national green tribunal (NGT) must be complied with in this regard, said Dutta. The dumping of untreated effluents from factories and cities must be stopped immediately.

Except facing a few hiccups the finance sector has risen to the occasion, say sources in the business. PSU insurer—Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), has been able to meet 79% of the target in terms of polices sold till mid-March, sources said. It is expected that the target of selling over 3.5 lakh policies in the Nagpur division will be easily met by end of March. The progress is like any other normal year despite the lockdown during the initial months of the year 2020, said sources. Insurance agent Bharat Parekh said the awareness towards insurance has increased during the pandemic. “This has pulled the sales despite a major part of the year going under lockdown. At present the offices are closed due to the weeklong curbs but clients are being helped in paying the premium and other formalities,” he said. G V Iyer, a stock broker and financial adviser said they have been able to run the offices without any hassles during the current lockdown. “Work has not stopped in any of the businesses, be it mutual funds, insurance or equity brokerage. Even the mutual fund investments have gone up considerably during the year,” he said. Prasanna Dani, a medical insurance agent, said works like putting up reimbursement claims or renewal of policies has been affected due to the closure. The job can be done online, yet lack of manpower in the insurance companies’ offices is also hampering the work. There are closures in some companies’ offices after Covid positive cases were found at the work place. Chartered accountant (CA) Julfesh Shah said CAs have been able to operate smoothly even with limited staff. However, some of the clients are not able to bring them the required documents due to their own offices being shut. There have been complaints that the lockdown will affect the monthly filing of GST returns but officials said it can always happen online. Even invoices these days are kept in the electronic format rather than having a physical copy. The help centre at the central GST department also remains to be open where businessmen can seek help in filing returns. The income tax office at Saraf Chambers, Sadar, has been closed after a number of employees were found positive. Even as the Aaykar Bhavan office at Seminary Hills is open, chartered accountants say they are wary of visiting the office with their clients’ work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lockdown-restrictions-fail-to-affect-financial-services-in-city/articleshow/81557182.cms||Shishir Arya

A Class XI girl playing with her younger brother was dragged out of her house in Jetalsar village of Jetpur taluka of Rajkot, by a 23-year-old youth, who thrashed her for rejecting his marriage proposal. When the girl refused to give in, the youth allegedly stabbed her 32 times with a knife in full public view till she died. On Wednesday, the police detained the youth Jayesh Sarvaiya, a resident of Jetalsar village, for the murder of a 16-year-old girl Shrusti Raiyani. Entire Jetalsar village observed bandh in wake of the killing of the teenage girl. All shops and markets in the village closed down for one day, said police, adding that additional security force was deployed in Jetalsar to make sure no untoward incident takes place. According to police, Jayesh had barged into Shrusti’s house in the village on Tuesday evening when she was alone with her younger brother. “Jayesh had been following the victim, who was a student of Jetpur Girl’s School, for quite some time. On Tuesday evening Jayesh came to Shrusti’s house and asked her to accept his marriage proposal. But the girl refused. So he dragged her out of the house and stabbed her 32 times,” said a police officer of Jetpur police station. He said that when the girl’s younger brother Harsh tried to intervene, Jayesh attacked him with a knife too. But Harsh managed to escape with few superficial wounds and took refuge in a neighbour’s house. As soon as the news about the brutal murder spread in the village people gathered around the girl’s house and demanded that the accused be arrested immediately. The girl’s body was sent to Rajkot civil hospital for postmortem. The family members first refused to accept the girl’s body till Jayesh was arrested. On Wednesday, police arrested Jayesh and assured the victim’s family of strict punishment for the accused. After this assurance, the girl’s family accepted her body and cremated her in the village. Shrusti’s father is a farmer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/23-year-old-stabs-class-xi-girl-32-times-for-refusing-marriage-proposal/articleshow/81555963.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: East to west, PWD looks to ease traffic woes||NEW DELHI: People living in east Delhi will no longer face traffic snarls on the otherwise traffic-heavy 5.5 kilometres between Apsara Border and Vivek Vihar. U-turns at the Surya Nagar and Ram Prasth intersections will be created as short-term decongestion measures. A traffic official said that a three-day trial will be conducted here between March 20 and 22. Officials said that this plan will help traffic till the long-term plan, that of construction of a flyover, is implemented. A few approvals are pending for the flyover work. The 2-km flyover with six lanes has received clearance from Delhi Urban Arts Commission and a tender will be floated after the project budget is passed. The estimate for the construction of the flyover is Rs 360 crore. Besides the flyover, there are also plans to construct pavements for pedestrian movement and cycle tracks on Road Number 56 (Ghazipur Road). Till the flyover comes up, two U-turns will be made in the 400 metres that separate the two traffic lights. A police officer said that a joint inspection by traffic police PWD and NGO Guru Hanuman Society of India was carried out to identify the civil changes for converting Surya Nagar and Ram Prasth intersections into U-turns to provide signal- and congestion-free traffic free movement. “Traffic engineering work and road safety measures required for implementing the U-turn scheme have been taken,” disclosed the officer. It is proposed to create a U-turn between the fourth and fifth streetlamp poles from the pedestrian bridge. The central verge of the main carriageway at Ram Prasth intersection will also be closed as will be the central verge on the main carriageway at Surya Nagar intersection, where another U-turn will be created between the third and fourth electricity poles from the intersection. The officer said the necessary road signage guiding commuters about the ongoing trial will be put up. “After conducting the trials and analysing the outcomes, permanent infrastructure may make the drive on this stretch hassle free,” he said. According to Delhi government sources, Road Number 56 connects GT Road with NH 24 on the other. It is most used by the people of Vivek Vihar, Sundar Nagar, Ramprastha Colony and Anand Vihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/east-to-west-pwd-looks-to-ease-traffic-woes/articleshow/81576679.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

Foreign devotees who flock there from all over the world to celebrate the birth of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, that coincides with Holi every year, will be largely absent because of the pandemic. Though they rue the fact that they cannot be physically present, they have made sure that the gifts for Sri Chaitanya and Radha-Krishna reach on time.  Be it chocolates and dry fruits or donations for preparing the bhog delicacies or the gaudy dresses and ornaments of the deities, gifts are pouring in everyday from across the world. By this time every year, foreign devotees reach the campus and start preparing for the festivities. They bake cakes, make pizzas, buy ingredients for different sweet items. This time they have sent the gifts and are virtually monitoring the preparations through local devotees. Mayapur has also made special arrangements for live streaming and virtual participation of foreign devotees in the different prayer sessions. So, devotees like Adideva Das from US sent a huge quantity of American almonds, while dry fruits are pouring in from middle eastern countries. Krishna Rupa Dasi from Australia, has sent stitched garments and ornaments for the March 28 festivities. “She has been doing this for the past three decades and will miss the celebrations this time.

These facilities will remain closed indefinitely. The number of Covid cases in the city rose to 246 on Tuesday, representing the doubling of cases over the past fortnight. The decision to pull buses off the road will affect the student community at large as the examination was going on. A Gujarat University official said stopping buses at such short notice will force many students to miss examinations as they come from far and would leave early for the first session of their examination. Jignesh Patel, the director of the parks and gardens department, said that combined daily footfalls since the easing of the lockdown, on average, had been 2 lakh at the city’s gardens and the zoo. Law Garden and Parimal Garden were crowded on most days. Officials in the AMC said that the two gardens lie close to a college and the Happy Street food zone, which attract a large number of visitors. The two gardens were crowded till the closing time each day. The Kankaria lakefront recorded footfalls of about 10,000 on weekends and about 5,000 on weekdays. Meanwhile, the Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation Limited has announced that Usmanpura garden, riverfront park near Subhash Bridge, Ellisbridge flower park, Dafnala Children’s Park, and the Diversity Park near Ambedkar Bridge will remain closed till further orders. Cycling on the lower promenade of the riverfront has been banned for now. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation late on Wednesday has announced that from Thursday, AMTS and BRTs buses will be off the road till further orders.

In a special event to be held on March 27, the government is likely to invite families of five freedom fighters. The event is part of the government’s 75-week celebrations of India’s Independence, said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. “It is very critical to learn from history and these stories will throw light on the struggles of independence. To move forward, we must remember the cost at which we won our independence—the sacrifice of our great freedom fighters and leaders. This freedom is precious and we must realise it,” Sisodia told TOI. Sanjay Garg, chief archivist at the Delhi Archives, said the list of invitees includes Vinay Bharat Ram of the Shri Ram group and Amit Rastogi of Ram Chandra Krishan Chandra Saree store of Old Delhi. “The others invited are Masroor Khan, great grandnephew of Hakim Ajmal Khan, Unani medicine practitioner and co-founder of Jamia Millia Islamia; Jugal Kishore Khanna’s great grandson; and Mir Mushtaque Ahmed’s grandson. The moderator of the event will be Sohail Hashmi, whose family was also connected to the freedom movement.” Garg further said that there would also be a talk at the India Islamic Centre on the freedom movement as part of the celebrations. Abhinandita Mathur, advisor to the deputy CM, said that “the upcoming programme will have senior citizens share stories from their families’ experience, and of the independence movement in Delhi. We are designing a range of programs on India’s Independence. Seminars, concerts, plays, films, competitions and a lot more are being planned across the capital.” Masroor Khan, the great grandnephew of Hakim Ajmal Khan, said that “such events are necessary. These educate people about the contribution of the freedom fighters.” “Such events make family members proud of their ancestors and will also help dispel the communal venom present in the society,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-to-invite-kin-of-freedom-fighters-for-special-event/articleshow/81557192.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Kolkata||IIT-Kgp, Dhaka univ map plastic waste in Ganga||Kolkata: Millions of tonnes of plastic waste are scattered on both the sides of the Ganga from Rishikesh to Howrah. The garbage that is mostly dumped there by municipal agencies makes its way into the river, thereby polluting its water. A study report jointly done by IIT Kharagpur, National Geographic and University of Dhaka has been published recently in this regard. Civil engineering faculty and research scholars from IIT Kharagpur were part of the study. They found the absence of source segregation, poor waste management strategy, lack of funds and resources etc. According to the IIT experts, about 70%-80% of waste is collected by urban local bodies. Of that waste, 72%-78% is disposed of in open dumpsites close to the Ganga. The team found that the plastic content in the waste went up to nearly 20% of the dumpsites. On an average the percentage of plastic waste was highest at Rishikesh and lowest at Anupshahr, said the IIT experts. “We found that 70%-85% of the plastic waste was composed of film plastic,” said Brajesh Dubey, a faculty of the institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iit-kgp-dhaka-univ-map-plastic-waste-in-ganga/articleshow/81557191.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Hyderabad||CBI, ED can probe Rayapati Sambasiva Rao, Transstroy case: Telangana HC||HYDERABAD: The Telangana HC on Wednesday said its restraint order on coercive action against former TDP MP Rayapati Sambasiva Rao’s firm Transstroy in a Rs 8,000 crore fraud case and other such companies dubbed defaulters by RBI was applicable only to banks and in no way stopped probe by agencies such CBI and ED. “In the case of Transstroy, the CBI and ED are free to proceed further with their investigation,”Chief Justice Hima Kohli said. The CBI is probing the alleged Rs 8,000 crore loan fraud by Transstroy and had sought permission to continue investigation. The CBI on Wednesday also disclosed that of the Rs 8,000 crore, more than Rs 5,500 crore was defrauded by the former TDP MP through fabricated Letters of Credit (LC) in the name of fictitious companies. The order allowing probe came during a hearing before a bench of CJ Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy on a plea by Transstroy director Sridhar Cherukuri’s challenging the action of banks that had taken a cue from an RBI circular on defaulters and declared their accounts as fraud without giving them a hearing. In its counter, CBI counsel K Surender informed the bench that as the high court passed an interim order stopping banks from taking coercive action against Transstroy, scores of defaulter companies were now approaching the HC for a similar relief. The banks on their part have approached the Supreme Court to allow them follow the RBI circular. “The management of Transstroy floated several paper companies in the names of its workers and used them to create bogus letters of credit (LC) worth thousands of crores of rupees. Showing this as a guarantee, the company availed huge loans from banks,” Surender said. The high court bench then made it clear that the restraint order was applicable only to banks and not to probe agencies such as CBI and ED.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-cbi-ed-can-probe-rayapati-transstroy-case/articleshow/81559661.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Delhi||Traffic signals to go on 4km stretch on Rohtak Road||New Delhi: The section of the congested Rohtak Road between Peeragarhi Chowk and Punjabi Bagh (West) metro station is likely to become signal-free for a distance of about 4km with the Public Works Department planning to construct two U-turn underpasses near the Jwalaheri Market T-junction and the Jwalaheri traffic lights. This means commuters need not stop at the signals and vehicles from Punjabi Bagh can access the other side of the road without disturbing flow of traffic. There are many densely populated localities such as Paschim Vihar, Jwalaheri, Madipur, Punjabi Bagh (West) and Raghubir Nagar on this stretch, making the road very congested, especially during peak hours. The first U-turn underpass will be created at the junction of Chaudhary Balbir Singh Marg and Rohtak Road. It should be a boon for those coming from Peeragarhi Chowk and wishing to return in the same direction. It will be signal-free for those taking the right turn there. Similarly, for those coming from Rohtak Road and going towards Peeragarhi Chowk, and for those who wish to return on the route, the U-turn underpass being constructed at the Jwalaheri traffic lights (Baba Ramdev Marg T-junction) will allow a free left turn. Cars that want to take a right turn will not have to stop at the Jwalaheri Market T-junction and Jwalaheri traffic intersection. PWD officials were optimistic that on completion of this project, motorists driving from Peeragarhi Chowk to Punjabi Bagh (West) metro station would no longer face any obstructions. Peeragarhi Chowk, the spot where Outer Ring Road and Rohtak Road intersect, has a road-level crossing, a flyover and the Delhi Metro passing over that. It is because of this that officials claimed it was close to impossible to implement any other decongestion plan apart from the one they have come up with. However, there are other interventions being considered, including to increase the width of both Rohtak Road and Outer Ring Road on some segments where space allows this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traffic-signals-to-go-on-4km-stretch-on-rohtak-road/articleshow/81576703.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Kochi||Ganja smuggling kingpin held from Andhra Pradesh||KOCHI: In a secretive mission carried out by the state police to crackdown on the ganja smuggling racket in the state, Ernakulam rural police arrested a 26-year-old, who is allegedly the kingpin of the gang that leads the interstate smuggling of the contraband. The arrested was identified as Pallasreenivasa Rao, a native of Makavarapalem in Andhra Pradesh. A special squad formed by the district police chief (Ernakulam rural) K Karthik to probe the interstate ganja smuggling activities nabbed the accused in his own turf in Andhra Pradesh by luring him into a trap. It took a three-day-long operation carried out in a secluded area 300km from Vijayawada to nab the accused, who works as a taxi-driver there. According to police, Rao, who has close links in the tribal belt of the region, was the main mediator for interstate ganja peddling between Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. He has been the prime contact person for Malayalis engaged in ganja sales. Rao is suspected to have helped smuggling thousands of kilograms of ganja into Kerala over these years. He came into the limelight when police seized 105kg ganja from two luxury cars at Angamaly KSRTC recently. Based on information from the persons who were arrested in that case, Karthik formed the special squad, expanding the probe to AP. “The modus operandi was that Rao meets potential buyers along the National Highway there to take orders based on samples of ganja provided to them. Once the clients agree to the price and quality of ganja, Rao would go into the forest and come back with the full load. The customers often had to wait for hours in prescheduled areas to receive the ganja,” said the police. Police approached Rao pretending to be customers and trapped him. Though he tried to flee, police outran and arrested him. Police said that it was a risky operation as the area was said to have Maoist presence. Police believe that Rao’s arrest will help them find more leads about the network supplying ganja to Kerala. The police team consisted of Narcotic Cell DSP K Ashwakumar inspector M Surendran, sub inspector T M Soofy, senior civil police officers Rony Augustine, P S Jeemon, and Prasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ganja-smuggling-kingpin-held-from-ap/articleshow/81557205.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Victory Flame travels to warships at Kidderpore dock||Kolkata: The Victory Flame travelling across the country as part of the Swarnim Vijay Varsh celebrations was taken to the Kidderpore Dock in Kolkata where the Indian Navy’s INS Airavat and INS Kora are now berthed. The naval ships are in the city as part of the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the 1971 Indo-Pak War. While the INS Airavat is a Shardul-class amphibious warfare vessel, the INS Kora is the lead ship of the Kora-class corvettes. Both the ships were built at the Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers in the city. “Both the INS Airavat and INS Kora that are on operational Covid duties were diverted to Kolkata to participate in the Swarnim Vijay Varsh celebrations. This year, we are celebrating 50 years of the 1971 Indo-Pak War that led to Bangladesh’s Independence. The Navy played a very important role in the War, both in the western and eastern theatres. Visitors to the ships are getting to know of the contribution,” said a senior official. The Indian Navy carried out a daring attack on Karachi Harbour on December 4, 1971. This resulted in the blockade of the Harbour and the prevention of men and materials from western Pakistan to the east. Imports to Pakistan were also curtailed after the Indian Navy imposed restrictions on the movement of ships towards Karachi. Barely 10 days later, the Navy played a crucial part in blockading the Chittagong and Mongla ports of Bangladesh to prevent Pakistani troops from escaping. Aircraft from the INS Vikrant also carried out strikes over East Pakistan and helped sink Pakistani vessels. The aircraft carrier also stood firm even after the US diverted a fleet towards the Bay of Bengal. “The Navy has continued to provide security and act as the country’s ambassadors to friendly nations. Our ships have sailed to foreign shores to provide humanitarian aid during natural disasters. They have also sailed for friendly visits and exercises. The INS Airavat played an important role in evacuating Indians stuck abroad during the pandemic. During the year, we want youngsters to learn more about the Navy and the important role it has been playing. Kolkata is of greater importance as many of Indian’s warships were built in the city. The Indian Navy has achieved a major level of indigenisation over the years,” the official added. On Tuesday, the Victory Flame was first received at INS Netaji Subhas, the Navy office in Kolkata, before being moved to the ships. The Flame was then taken along the Hooghly by the Navy’s patrol boats. Once back on shore, the Flame was taken to Lascar Memorial where a ceremony was held and attended by serving and retired naval personnel. Apart from Army formations at Kolkata, Panagarh and Barrackpore, the Flame was also taken to Indian Air Force bases at Kalaikunda, Panagarh and Barrackpore. “After all, the War was a joint effort. Just as the Army fought on the ground, our fighter aircraft practically finished off any threat from the air while the Navy blockaded the harbours, sunk enemy ships and destroyed the large fuel tanks at Karachi. During the year, we shall celebrate the contributions of all three forces. The year is of particular importance in West Bengal as the state was affected the most,” said another official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/victory-flame-travels-to-warships-at-kidderpore-dock/articleshow/81557198.cms||Jayanta Gupta

On Thursday, Baijal is to chair a meeting of the authority where DDA’s modified TOD policy will be tabled for approval, say sources. Last year, DDA had suggested a few modifications to the policy, which aims at high-density, mixed-use development close to Metro stations to induce people to walk, cycle and use Metro and other public transport for commute. The changes include identification of transit nodes and influence zones, where policy provisions allowing mixed-use development would be applicable. It also has provisions for traffic audits, identification of vending zones, walkability of the projects, etc. The policy was put in the public domain for suggestions and objections, and will now be tabled for approval, a source said. If approved, it will be sent to the Union housing and urban affairs ministry for approval and notification. “Chaired a meeting with VC, DDA, officials from NBCC & other experts to review the progress of project “Integrated Development of East Delhi Hub, Karkardooma”, the first project conceived as per Transit Oriented Development Norms with Public Private Partnership,” Baijal tweeted on Wednesday. The Rs 1,168-crore project spread over 73 acres will have mixed uses of residential and commercial components and 19.3 acre green area. The green area includes a “Central Green” spread over nearly 10 acre, around which the entire project has been planned. There will be other environment friendly features, apart from use of green building concept, skywalk for connectivity etc. The project, which is being executed by NBCC, will have 6,518 dwelling units, including 1,992 units for the economically weaker section. It will also boast of schools, dispensaries, library, cultural centre, community halls, convenient shopping, community spaces, creche, etc. The entire project is planned around Delhi Metro’s Pink (Shiv Vihar-Majlis Park) and Blue (Dwarka-Vaishali) corridors, which crisscross each other at Karkardooma. The two stations, part of the layout, will provide connectivity to the commercial complex. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is also planning commercial development at Pink Line’s Karkardooma station to cater to the expected rise in the demand due to the TOD project. “Advised VC, DDA to firm up an activity-wise timeline for each phase of implementation to facilitate close monitoring and time-bound completion of the project. Also advised the team to prepare a blueprint for the implementation of PPP component of the project on priority,” Baijal tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mega-tod-project-close-to-metro-station-gathers-pace/articleshow/81557208.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Another 2,000 Kashmir migrants are likely to return under the same policy in 2021, the government told Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. Stating that 44,167 Kashmiri migrant families had to move from the valley since 1990, of which 39, 782 were Hindus, MoS (Home) G Kishan Reddy , in reply to question, said 520 migrants had returned to Kashmir for taking up jobs under the rehabilitation package since the abrogation of Article 370 in J&K on August 5, 2019. Another 2,000 migrant candidates are also likely to return under the same policy in the year 2021 after successful completion of the selection process, he said. Reddy said the government devised policies for return and rehabilitation of Kashmiri migrants under the Prime Minister’s packages in 2008 and 2015. These policies covered incentives for housing to encourage rehabilitation of Kashmir migrants back at their ancestral places in valley; and enhancement in cash assistance/cash relief to Kashmiri migrants, from Rs 500 per family in 1990 to Rs 13,000 per family @Rs. 3250 per person.

The court has called for the enforcement of the order within six months. “We have given our anxious consideration to the contents of the report and its annexures. It discloses gross onslaught on the ecological and environmental fabric and the animal life in the area, which is referred to as the Sunderbans and its adjoining areas, which operate as life support systems to the ecological unit. The aforenoted ecologically and environmentally fragile area is not only being encroached upon but also being deprived of its ability to sustain itself as a unit of ecological and environmental balance mechanism,” the judges observed in the order. The Sunderbans Biosphere covers 4,000sqkm, the Sunderban Tiger Reserve is spread over 2,500sqkm and the adjoining reserve forest spans 600sqkm. Pointing to the need for conservation, the division bench observed that the biosphere imbalance would directly impact plant and animal life and their existence needed to be protected by insulating the critically endangered areas in the Sunderbanas from any human activity that was not directly related to conservation. “We are clear in our mind that the Sunderbans area cannot be utilized or permitted to be accessed except for its preservation, management, protection and custody,” the order stated. The court has asked the South 24 Parganas DM and SP to enforce the order within six months. “Within that period, the state will address the issue as to whether all the areas to which reference has been made in this order could be brought under one umbrella in terms of administration so that executive control and police control can be effectively and smoothly enforced over the area,” the order stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hc-passes-order-to-save-sunderbans/articleshow/81557209.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

Last September, Karanj police lodged an FIR against Altaf Memon, a hawker near Lal Darwaza. He was accused of not wearing a mask, making people gather around his cart and of violating social distancing norms. He was booked under Section 188 of the IPC for violation of a notification issued under Section 144 of the CrPC. Section 51B of the Disaster Management Act was also invoked against him, which was for punishment for obstruction against whoever without justifiable cause violates such notifications and he was liable to be punished either with the maximum of a one-year jail term or a fine or both. Memon alone was not booked by police. Ayub Shaikh, Javed Shaikh and few other hawkers, who sell wares in the Lal Darwaza area, were also booked by Karanj police. Chargesheets were filed against them in the metropolitan court. When they were summoned, they pleaded guilty and requested the court to show leniency because they were poor and assured the court that they would not repeat theirs mistakes and would follow social distancing rules and wear masks in public places. The court rebuked them for their offences and allowed them to go. Similarly, 21-year-old Harsh Patel got away with Rs 100 fine for violating night curfew.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-lets-corona-violators-off-with-just-a-rebuke/articleshow/81557204.cms||---

The All Gujarat Vali Mandal issued a statement urging the government to switch back to online classrooms till the Covid situation returns to normal. According to the association, 192 students in Surat, 100 in Saurashtra and 150 in Ahmedabad, who were attending on school and tuition classes have been infected with Covid-19 in the past few days. The association president, Naresh Shah, urged the government to conduct the coming school exams online rather than in pen-and-paper mode. Classes can continue online when educational institutes are closed, something the state government has said in its earlier directives while allowing the re-opening of schools and colleges. Educational institutes in the state started reopening partially in a phase-wise manner from the second week of January after staying shut for nine months. On-campus studies for students below Class VI have not resumed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/parents-seek-3-week-school-closure/articleshow/81557215.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Muslim body flays book’s ‘divisive’ content||Jaipur: Rajasthan Muslim Forum (RMF) on Wednesday condemned the ‘divisive’ contents in the class XII political science textbook which termed terrorism a strand of Islam.RMF convener Mohsin Rasheed had raised the issue on March 13 by uploading a video on YouTube alleging that the textbook and publisher Sanjiv Passbook were propagating hatred towards a particular community. The RMF, which is an apex body of Muslims in the state, lodged complaints against the writers and the publisher with police commissioner Anand Srivastava twice on March 15 and 17 and received an assurance of action. “At a time when people are being arrested on false and fabricated charges known to all, here objectionable contents are in full public view, but still a complaint has not been filed. It’s unfortunate,” said Rasheed. RMF member Naim Rabbani blamed the Congress government for failing to remove it in the last two years of their rule. “I can understand that the content was crafted during the BJP regime, which is expected the way they do their politics. It is unbelievable that the Congress, which had revised the content, has not dropped the same,” said Rabbani. Expressing fear, historian Zahida Shabnam, who was part of the delegation that raised the issue and lodged the complaint, said the textbook and the guidebook should be recalled immediately and no questions should be asked on the same in the class XII board exams. News clips and pictures of the content have already gone viral on social media. TOI called up Pradeep Mittal of Sanjiv Passbook who didn’t respond but a person who claimed to be his brother Rajesh called back and said, “The matter dates back to 2017 and we have already given a written apology.” Kotwali Police arrested three persons for ransacking a shop of Sanjiv Passbook at Dhamini Market on Wednesday. The arrested accused — Yunus Chopdar, Ikramudin and Nuruddin — had allegedly ransacked the shop in the afternoon, confirmed Vickram Singh, SHO, Kotwali police station. They were accompanied by around 40 youths who were protesting against the passbook owners for publishing objectionable content in the class XII political science textbook.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/muslim-body-flays-books-divisive-content/articleshow/81558310.cms||---
---||Delhi||Form panel to look into X-ray report of farmer who died on Republic Day: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI/BAREILLY: Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the AAP government to set up a panel of experts to examine the X-ray report of a youth killed near the ITO crossing during the farmers’ tractor rally on the Republic Day. Justice Yogesh Khanna also asked doctors of Maulana Azad Medical College to prepare a report from the original X-ray plate received by Delhi Police from the Uttar Pradesh police so that it can be examined by the board comprising medical and forensic experts and a radiologist. The board will be set up by the secretary of Delhi government’s health department. Meanwhile, Delhi Police apprised the court that it had shown the CCTV footage to the family members and the lawyers of victim Navreet Singh. Challenging the police version that Navreet had died due to an accident, his grandfather, Hardeep Singh, has moved court claiming that the 24-year-old had gunshot injuries on his head. “Court is the only place where I expect to get justice. We are inching towards revealing the truth,” the 75-year-old grandfather said on Wednesday.  Navreet’s postmortem was conducted at the Rampur district hospital in UP. Both Delhi and UP police have told the court that Navreet did not suffer any gunshot wounds. Delhi Police had earlier said that according to the postmortem report, the farmer had died due to a head injury as a result of an accident and all his injuries were possible in a road accident. The petition has sought a court-monitored SIT probe into the death. Citing the footage collected from CCTV cameras at Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg where Navreet had died, Delhi Police has claimed he was driving the tractor at a high speed and it had overturned after hitting barricades. Nobody had fired upon the vehicle or its driver, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/form-panel-to-look-into-x-ray-report-of-farmer-who-died-on-r-day-hc/articleshow/81557244.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Genuine apology or you’ll be sorry: Telangana HC to 3 officials facing jail||HYDERABAD: Describing the apologies offered by the additional collector, RDO and Tahsildar of Sanga Reddy district as not genuine but more of a ‘backup plan’, the Telangana high court on Wednesday warned the three officials that it would not grant them any relief from the two months’ jail punishment awarded for wilful disobedience of court orders over issuance of e-pattadar passbook to a farmer. The bench also found fault with them for not appearing before the court when their appeals against the conviction were heard.  “Do not forget that you are now convicted contemnors. Keep attending every hearing from now onwards,” Chief Justice Hima Kohli said who, along with Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, was hearing a plea after the single judge handed out the jail sentence. Issuing a stern warning that if they did not mend their old ways of showing scant regard towards courts, Justice Kohli said: “We will vacate the stay on your conviction and you will be taken straight to jail. The hands of law are long enough to reach you, wherever you are.” The HC observations came in the case related to tussle over about five acres at Kandi-Chimnapur village in Sanga Reddy district. A single judge earlier directed authorities to give e-pattadar passbook to E J David of Mahabubnagar who purchased this land in Chimnapur area eight years ago. The vendors from whom David bought this land had a title along with pattadar passbooks. But when David sought a passbook, revenue officials said that one Panduranga Rao Deshmukh sold 63 acres to several people and this five-acre plot was part of that land. They also said that Panduranga Rao had no title. The judge went through the revenue record and found that Rao had a proper title. He found fault with revenue officials for denying the passbook to David. The court also brushed aside the claims of the state which tried to brand the land in question as Billa Dakhala land and sentenced the officials to jail for repeatedly failing to implement the orders of the court. The state preferred an appeal against this order but quickly withdrew it, saying it would file a review plea before the high court. But when the bench verified whether it was done, K S Murthy, the counsel representing David, pointed out that that state neither filed any review nor did it grant the e-passbook to David. The HC bench has now sought details of contempt cases pending against the three convicted officials and adjourned the case to April 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/genuine-apology-or-youll-be-sorry-hc-to-3-babus-facing-jail/articleshow/81559701.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Regular high-level meetings are being held to expedite the remaining work.” The project was supposed to be complete by September 2019.Manoj Das, additional chief secretary (ACS) in the CMO and in-charge ACS, industry and mines department said, “Dholera SIR’s activation area work, as approved by the government of India and the state government, is now near completion, so we have started aggressively marketing the project internationally. Over Rs 2,800 crore has been spent so far for the development of Dholera SIR to create plug-and-play infrastructure for industries.

---||Delhi||DUTA stir against new funding norm for 12 DU colleges||New Delhi: Despite Delhi government releasing funds to 12 fully-funded Delhi University colleges, the DU Teachers’ Association (DUTA) led a protest march to the lieutenant governor’s office on Thursday to oppose the government’s move to bring in a new pattern of assistance for the funds. After protesting outside chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence over the funding issue on March 15, DUTA has decided to continue its agitation. On Thursday, several teachers marched from the DU vice-chancellor’s office demanding that LG Anil Baijal intervenes in the matter. “The strength of the teachers’ collective came to the fore when DUTA’s protests and mass action programmes forced chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to release the much delayed grants-in-aid to the 12 colleges,” the association claimed in a statement. The CM had met the 12 principals on March 16 and said the government would release the pending funds while the status of other funds would be decided by Delhi High Court where DU teachers had filed a petition. In the meeting, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had said that since these colleges were 100% funded by Delhi government, they should follow its pattern of assistance. “The colleges must take prior permission from Delhi government before appointing the staff because Delhi government is funding their salaries and expenses,” he had said. DUTA president Rajib Ray alleged that “the government is forcing these 12 colleges to adopt in their governing bodies the pattern of assistance document issued by the directorate of higher education. This is sinisterly prepared to take these 12 colleges out of DU and run them on self-financing mode to escape government funding. This is absolutely wrong as these are constituent colleges of DU.” The government also wants a board of governors for colleges which, as per National Education Policy (NEP), will be the governing authorities of each higher educational institution free from external control, Ray added. DUTA demanded that the LG must ensure immediate withdrawal of senior administrative officers given additional charge of these 12 colleges. DU has no such provision and the office of the principal is “more than adequate and capable of handling the administrative functioning”, it insisted. “Instead of this excessive interference, Delhi government must focus on releasing grants for infrastructure development and maintenance and for creating posts,” DUTA said. At DU’s executive council meeting, members Seema Das and J L Gupta demanded that the university rejects both. Despite repeated attempts, Delhi government didn’t comment on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/duta-stir-against-new-funding-norm-for-12-du-colleges/articleshow/81576753.cms||---

But the standard operating procedures (SOPs) would have to be followed strictly and seriously. The state government would be stricter on imposing restrictions,” said senior Shiv Sena leader Parab, also a spokesperson of the party. Several business entities, traders and transporters have been requesting the state government not to impose a total lockdown in the wake of the recent spurt in Covid-19 cases. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar recently said the decision on lockdown would be taken only by the chief minister. State health minister Rajesh Tope also said lockdown was not a solution to the problem. Baba Shinde, the president of Maharashtra State Vahan Chalak Malak Pratindhi Mahasanghatna, said, “If it is so (lockdown not a solution), why do they warn us about lockdown every second day? We have recently given a letter to the Pune RTO (Regional Transport Office) and the divisional commissioner to give us a full year for payment of taxes and talk to the banks, troubling us for EMIs of vehicles. We have requested them not to impose a lockdown. Almost 30% of transporters are still unable to resume business after the last year’s lockdown and if it happens again, many will not recover ever.” Ravi Birajdar, a cabbie, claimed that his business had gone down yet again. “I request the government not to hit us with another lockdown as it would destroy many of us,” he said. Psychologists stated that the uncertainty and constant murmurs about lockdown were affecting many. “There has been an increase in the number of people suffering from anxiety and depression off late. During interactions, many said constant fears about another lockdown was too much for them and they were financially too weak to handle things if it happened. Some regular patients are also asking for more medicines. The state government should spare a thought to these before taking a decision. Warnings about lockdown are having a negative psychological impact on many,” psychologist Swapnil Deshmukh told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-not-considering-lockdown-stricter-norms-likely-transport-minister/articleshow/81557252.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Private hospital Covid patients save Rs 15.5 crore, thanks to civic audits||MUMBAI: Since June, auditors appointed by the BMC have gone over nearly 11,000 bills generated by private hospitals for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. The exercise, undertaken to detect inflated bills and prevent overcharging, resulted in the refund of over Rs 15.5 crore to patients till December. The municipal auditor’s department said the BMC put around 70 auditors on the job and they went through the bills generated by 39 private hospitals that had treated Covid-19 patients. Following complaints that prominent private hospitals had not shared enough beds with the BMC for Covid-19 patients, the state government had deputed five IAS officers and two auditors to ensure their availability and keep prices in check. Municipal auditors joined the team and went over bills worth around Rs 181 crore when taken together. BMC officials said they had received only 358 complaints regarding inflated bills fro the treatment of Covid-19 patients at private hospitals. “From these bills we asked the hospitals to refund around Rs 2.74 crore to patients, since there were cases of inflated bills and overcharging,” chief municipal auditor Sitaram Kale said. “Later we carried out a suo motu audit of close to 11,000 bills of patients at hospitals where there were more complaints. These were almost all the bills generated by private hospitals between April and December. In these cases, around Rs 12.93 crore was either reduced or refunded by hospitals. Totally, we have refunded or reduced around Rs 15.75 crore.” Kale said the team was also carrying out pre-audits of private hospital bills before these are issued. “So there are very few cases of inflated bills now. Our audit staff are sitting at the hospitals — 25% to 30% audit staff was on hospital duty," Kale said. Municipal officials said that in some cases private hospitals had come up with innovative charges like care and hygiene charges, staff management charges and N-95 allocation charges to inflate bills. Additional municipal commissioner (health) Suresh Kakani said that municipal auditors had reviewed all the complaints that had come to them. “Now there are very few cases of inflated bills or private hospitals overcharging. Patients have been sending their bills and complaints by email too. The appointed officers are reviewing the bills and taking appropriate action. Bills can be sent even after payment and if there is any error or overcharging, patients can be refunded by the hospital,” Kakani said. Officials said that an audit of bills from January this year was underway “The BMC must add more auditors to the team and audit more bills. All bills of patients at private hospitals must be audited. FIRs must be filed against hospitals for overcharging. Just refunding money to patients is not enough,” BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaipvt-hospital-covid-patients-save-rs-15-5cr-thanks-to-civic-audits/articleshow/81557285.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Kozhikode||Sowing his love for the hammer & sickle||Kozhikode: In his early 20s, P Madhusudanan, an ardent supporter of CPM used to cut laterite stone for a living. His love for the party symbol was so much so that he used to carve it onto the red stone as a hobby then. Thirty years on, Madhu’s love for the party and its symbol has only increased with time, proof of which is his ‘paddy farm’ which he has designed in the shape of the hammer and sickle as part of his campaign for the party. Madhuvettan, as he is fondly called in Panalad, has grown the crop in about 900sq ft area. Candidate from Mattannur, K K Shailaja had visited Madhu recently to convey her gratitude. It took nearly three weeks for Madhu to grow the paddy after carving the symbol onto the land so that it would grow into a thick green party symbol by the time the election heats up. Madhu who started off as a stonecutter about three decades ago, switched to tailoring as a profession. At a time when printing the party symbol onto flags was a difficult task, he said he was always busy sewing the party flag during elections. “Back then we used to cut the cloth in the shape of sickle and hammer and then sew it on to the flag. I was always good at perfectly designing the symbol and I used to do a lot of such work. Besides, my entire family and villagers traditionally believe in communism and the symbol has a special place in my heart,” says Madhu. Madhu had come up with a similar idea for the campaign during panchayat election as well. Last time, he neatly cut out the symbol on a grass filled compound with a hoe. It had taken him only three days to perfect the symbol that time but it was only half the size. “We are lucky this time to have a candidate like Shailaja teacher. Our only aim is to increase the majority and hopefully my work would be of help,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/sowing-his-love-for-the-hammer-sickle/articleshow/81557299.cms||---

Out of the remaining 69, notices have been issued to 68 eateries to deposit environmental compensation. The status of one eatery was still under review. The inspections were carried out between January and March. “Out of 104, only 35 units have been found meeting environmental norms and are having valid consent to operate. The rest of them were not in compliance with the norms. No channelisation of emissions, discharging trade effluent to sewers without any provision of oil and grease trap, no effluent treatment plant and operating without DPCC’s consent were among some of the violations noticed,” said a DPCC official, adding 20 units had so far deposited the environmental compensation. DPCC says if the compensation amount is not paid, the eateries can also be shut down. “DPCC has issued letters, along with a list of the remaining 48 eating joints, to the SDM (Delhi Cantt) for recovery of the environmental compensation,” said the official. Notices to these eateries had been issued prior to the lockdown, following a National Green Tribunal (NGT) order. Inspections were first carried out in July.

The octogenarian died on Sunday from Covid-related complications in the ICU of Mayo Hospital, where his wife is also being treated in the general ward. The woman’s grandson, who visits her on a regular basis wearing a PPE kit, has requested doctors and paramedical staffers not to divulge the news of the death to his grandmother. The elderly couple, married for over 60 years, was admitted to Mayo Hospital last week. The husband, first to be detected with Covid infection, was hospitalized on March 9, whereas his wife was admitted the following day. The family members are finding it an uphill task to evade the elderly woman’s relentless queries about her husband’s health and insistence on speaking to him over phone. The family members also sounded baffled as to how the infection was transmitted to the elderly couple, which mostly stayed at home. “Our granny had a surgery recently following which many relatives and friends had visited her, which may have done the damage. It’s difficult to pinpoint who passed on the infection to our grandparents. All we can say is other members in the family have tested negative,” he said. The family source said the 85-year-old had developed multiple complications and probably also suffered cardiac arrest before succumbing in the ICU. His wife, admitted to general ward, has almost recovered. “We fear she may not be able to bear the shock if we reveal about our grandfather’s death to her. She senses something is amiss and keeps mumbling about her being left alone in this world, but we keep on diverting her thoughts,” said a family member. “We pretend calling grandfather on phone, but tell her the call is not getting through. We engage her in some other discussion,” said the grandson, who expressed gratitude for the medical team which has managed to save the granny.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kin-conceal-hubbys-death-to-help-80-year-old-ve-recover/articleshow/81557306.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Jaipur||2 Army weapon systems decommissioned||Jaisalmer: To strengthen the Indian Army’s artillery and for making way for newer equipment with latest technologies, two of the longest-serving artillery weapon systems — the 130mm self-propelled M-46 Catapult Guns and the 160mm Tampella Mortars —were decommissioned at Mahajan Field Firing Range on Wednesday. The ceremony was marked by customary firing of the last salvoes. The decommissioning firing was attended by Lt Gen K Ravi Prasad, Director General artillery and other senior officers of the army. These weapon systems have been in the inventory of the Indian Army for close to 60 years and the decommissioning would make way for newer equipment with latest technologies. A defence source said, “The 130mm Catapult, with a range of more than 27km, was a successful merger of two existing weapon systems: Vijayanta tanks and 130mm M-46 guns. This hybrid platform was a response to the need for a mobile artillery gun system to support strike formations on the western borders, after the 1965 and 1971 wars. The guns were inducted in 1981 and were employed successfully during a number of operations.” The defence source further said, “The 160mm Tampella Mortars, with a range of 9.6km, were inducted after the 1962 war with China to fulfil the need for a weapon system to clear high crests of the northern borders. Originally an import from the Israeli Defence Forces, this mortar was successfully deployed on the Line of Control in the Leepa valley and the Hajipir Bowl and played a crucial part in maintaining the sanctity of the Line of Control. The mortars also played a significant part in the 1999 Kargil war.” A source added, “These weapon systems have been in the inventory of the Indian Army for close to 60 years, and have been decommissioned to make way for newer equipment employing the latest technologies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-army-weapon-systems-decommissioned/articleshow/81558489.cms||---

Earlier, P C Thomas had quit NDA alleging neglect within the alliance. Thomas formally announced the merger at the election convention of Monce Joseph in Kaduthuruthy. P J Joseph could not attend the event as he was recovering from Covid-19. Joseph, senior among the two, will be the new chairman of the party. While Thomas will be the deputy chairman, Monce Joseph will be vice-chairman and Joy Abraham secretary general. The other office-bearers will be announced after the election. Among various KC parties, only Thomas has been given the legal right to use the word ‘Kerala Congress’ as the name of the party. The remaining KC factions will have to use brackets next to KC to indicate their group. KC (Joseph) faction fell in trouble after the Supreme Court, on Monday, rejected the group’s appeal challenging Election Commission’s order recognising Jose K Mani faction as the official KC (M) and allotting the two leaves symbol to it. They were in more trouble after the ‘chenda’ symbol which their candidates used in local body polls was not in the list of symbols of the EC. Monce Joseph and Joy Abraham held talks on Tuesday with P C Thomas after the possibility of registering a new party and getting a new symbol appeared impossible ahead of the election. P C Thomas too was in crisis following differences within NDA. Thomas was waiting for a chance to return to UDF and he achieved this through the merger with UDF ally Joseph faction. Thomas had distanced himself the Mani group and formed IFDP when Jose K Mani entered politics. He later merged IFDP with Joseph group and became part of LDF before parting ways with Joseph in 2010.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/thomas-quits-nda-mergeswith-udf-ally-joseph-group/articleshow/81557342.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

The stand taken by Samastha leaders has put IUML in a fix given the sensitive matter and the serious charges of polytheism raised by them. Khader is also the MLA from Vengara. Sunni Yuvajana Sangam leader Nazar Faizi Koodathayi said that a monotheist performing polytheism to display secularism constitutes an act of deception. Another Samastha leader Abdul Hameed Faizy Ambalakkadavu went a step further and invoked the Kitab-u-irtidad, the chapter in Islamic jurisprudence which deals with acts that constitutes apostasy, and said that one can understand the seriousness of such matters by reading the chapter. “For a Muslim, polytheism is not secularism,” Koodathayi said in his Facebook post. In a tacit reference to Khader, he said that the statement made after paying obeisance that ‘Guruvayurappan is seeing him, understanding everything and will shower blessings’ is the one which is made by sacrificing faith. “Such political deception coming even from knowledgeable persons will be looked down with disdain even by persons who believe in multiple gods,” he said, adding that it is not election but attaining the heavenly abode which is of crucial importance to a believer. Koodathayi said that he was proud of the speaker’s knowledge and understanding of Vedas and Upanishads on hearing his speeches in the Assembly to affirm the humanism of ‘Arsha Bharathiyatha’. “Understanding that both Islam and Hinduism are rooted in humanism and propagating that message is the core of secularism. Hindus and Muslims stand together and agree up to that point. Even those who believe in multiple gods don’t insist that for upholding secularism and humanism one needs to accept polytheism,” he added. Ambalakkadavu said that if leaders of Muslim organizations perform such acts, then it will give a wrong message to followers that such things are permissible. “Secularism is not taking bits from all religions. The name for that is Emperor Akbar’s Din-i-Ilahi. If secularism is accepting rituals and faith of other religions as needed, then we don’t need secularism,” he said. Khader had taken off his sandals when he proceeded to the point at East Nada of Guruvayur temple, where even non-Muslims are allowed to offer prayers. “I am sure Lord Guruvayurappan will accept a packet of rice flakes from this political ‘Kuchela’. I’m sure Guruvayurappan will see my mind and I think he has blessed me,” Khader had said on March 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/khaders-prayers-in-front-of-guruvayur-temple-irks-samastha/articleshow/81557357.cms||---

The accused sarpanch and her husband demanded the bribe for approval of the site map of a gas agency with the sarpanch’s signature. A sarpanch of Gandiphali panchayat samiti, Ladpura, Kota, identified as Nirmlabai Meena (38) and her husband Mahavir Meena (43), residents of Galana village of Ladpura tehsil, Kota, were on Wednesday arrested from their home after the duo had allegedly accepted a bribe of Rs 10,000, said ASP, Kota Rural Prerna Shekhawat.

---||Delhi||At Delhi's Kamla Nagar market, those on foot to be king||NEW DELHI: It is going to be easier for shoppers and pedestrians in Kamla Nagar Market in north Delhi if the plan to decongest the popular area near Delhi University’s North Campus is properly implemented. All vehicular traffic will be prohibited on Kolhapur Road between 9am and 9pm. During the day, the full pedestrianisation of the street will be possible with a 2-metre-wide vending zone in the centre of the road. This central zone will be an “open-air mall” where people can shop, eat, sit and relax. Vehicles will be allowed back in the 9pm-9am period and the shop front area of 1.8m with a buffer zone of 0.7m will be made available for pedestrian movement. The new street plan for Mandelia Road proposes that the 18-metre-wide road should dedicate more space for pedestrian movement with only 6m for the use of vehicles. Under the new avatar, the road will, therefore, have 4.3-metre-wide footpaths on either side with a 2m buffer zone to accommodate utilities, hawkers and street furniture. Before formulating these interventions, a walkability audit of all the connecting roads was carried out on parameters like path availability, crossing safety, amenities, obstructions, sense of security, etc. On a scale of A to E with A the highest, none of the roads scored A or B but mostly fell in the C category alongside a few dangerous stretches, such as on GT Karnal Road and Ghantaghar Road, in the D and E classes. Bungalow, Maharaja Agarsen, Mandelia and Kolhapur roads were graded as C, with identified problems like encroachment by hawkers and illegal parking, absence of footpaths and safe pedestrian crossings and surface quality. The total length of roads in the area is 7.8km of which 5.4km have footpaths though only 55% were deemed to be walkable. Utilities such as transformers are present on the footpath on Satyawati Marg and Ghantaghar Road, forcing people to walk on the carriageway, the walkability audit noted. The buffer zones between pedestrians and vehicles hold signboards, transformers and toilets that hamper movement. The masterplan proposes the use of grass pavers and brick jaalis in green buffer areas to increase water retention and reduce waterlogging. While some bollards had been introduced in the previous avatar of the plan, the shopkeepers in the market had reported that they only increased the encroachment by hawkers and vendors. The new proposal states that self-monitoring will be triggered by making shopkeepers the stakeholders to ensure that walkways in front of their shops remained clear of encroachments. “There would be a heavy penalty for violators,” the plan advises. The working group formulating the plan was informed that an automated parking underneath Spark Mall had the capacity to hold around 800 cars, but it is under-utilised due to long waiting time for entry and exit. “North Delhi Municipal Corporation was directed to explore mechanisms to make the on-street parking rate higher in comparison to the automated parking at Spark Mall,” the plan says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-kamla-nagar-mkt-those-on-foot-to-be-king/articleshow/81557365.cms||Paras Singh

Golden Rock workshop and North East Railway jointly shared the cash award of Rs 1.50 lakh sanctioned by the railway board. Golden Rock workshop is an energy management system (EnMS) and GreenCo (Gold rated) certified workshop. This necessitates monitoring of electrical energy consumption up to micro level. Since manual collection of data is not paving the way for dynamic control of energy consumption, it was proposed to install IoT-based smart energy management system. The system collects data from energy meters, upload them to cloud and generates consolidated reports for critical analysis of energy consumption pattern. Since the system is fetching energy consumption data every second, it has become a handy tool for energy planning and identification of high consumption machines, utilisation pattern and idle running of machines. The data obtained will indicate the loading pattern, peak and offload condition of feeders so that concerned section in-charges could take corrective action as a predictive maintenance in order to avoid power interruptions and fire hazards. The system is also cost-effective .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/golden-rock-bags-award-for-smart-energy-system/articleshow/81558603.cms||---

Those seeking admission into diploma and certificate courses at so called ‘business schools’ may find themselves in trouble as Osmania University (OU) has said these courses are not recognised by the university. It has come to the notice of the university that certain colleges in Hyderabad were misleading students by running business schools offering diploma/certificate courses, which were not recognised by OU, on the premises of degree colleges affiliated to the university. “The students and parents of such colleges are frequently approaching the university and complaining that the colleges have been collecting huge fees from the students…Running a business school on the degree college premises and collecting huge amount of fee from the students is highly objectionable and against the affiliation rules,” the varsity said in a notice, a copy of which is with TOI, to all affiliated colleges. The university is now in the process of cracking whip on all such errant colleges.  “We have found close to 15-20 degree colleges so far that are misleading students in the name of a business school. While they have affiliation only to run a BCom/BBA course, they lure students in the name of some add-on diploma/certificate courses in management, business analytics etc. and seek additional fee,” OU director, academic audit, Ashok Naidu said. Nearly 220 OU-affiliated colleges run B Com/BBA programmes. Officials said in February 2020, the university had issued notices to many such errant colleges that were running unaffiliated certificate/diploma courses. However, due to the pandemic, the university could not take action against them. “Now, we are conducting surprise inspections to crack the whip on all such degree colleges, deceiving students in the name of a business school. Many have even changed their college names and boards offering such courses. Students should always check with the university before enrolling in any such courses,” Naidu added. As per the notice, if the inspection committee found the functioning of business schools offering diploma/certificate courses, which OU does not offer, at the degree college, stringent action would be taken against such colleges by imposing a huge penalty or disaffiliation of the college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/biz-courses-at-some-colleges-not-legal-ou-warns-students/articleshow/81557348.cms||Preeti Biswas

The incident occurred at a housing society in Mangalwar Peth on Monday morning. An FIR relating to the incident was registered by Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) technician Madhuri Kulsanghe (28). Assistant inspector Sandeep Jore of Samarth police station said on Wednesday, “The MSEDCL had served notice on Sayyed at his residence requesting him to clear the dues by Monday or they would be constrained to disconnect the power supply. Sayyed, however, did not pay heed to the notice.” Jore said, “Kulsanghe disconnected the power supply by opening the meter room at around 11am on Monday. Sayyed, who was present at his residence, rushed downstairs, got into a dispute with the technician and instructed her to restore the electric supply but Kulsanghe refused.” “Sayyed hurled abuses at the woman, pushed the meter door on her and threatened to lock her, if she refused to consider his demand. After the dispute between them became heated, Sayyed locked her in the room for five minutes. He later opened the door after the official alerted her superiors, who in turn contacted the police. The suspect was taken into custody for preventing the official from discharging duty after she lodged an FIR under the Indian Penal Code,” he further added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-abuses-threatens-msedcl-technician-held/articleshow/81557336.cms||---

The direction came from the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma while it was hearing two petitions filed by Red Rose Convent School and Udham Singh Nagar Association of Independent Schools. The petitioners argued that though the schools had already started for Class XII, it was only through the February order that the physical classes for students for junior classes began. However, the order issued by the chief secretary only talked about opening of schools and didn't mention whether the schools can charge tuition fee from the students or not. “The court noted that there is a lacuna in the order and therefore directed the counsel to seek clarification on the issue. The court has given the counsel four weeks to respond. The case has been listed for further hearing on April 24,” said an advocate present in the hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-seeks-clarification-from-state-on-whether-schools-can-charge-fee-from-class-vi-xi-students/articleshow/81556103.cms||Prashant Jha

In south Mumbai's D ward, officials have already started testing hawkers and vendors at prominent markets.Ward officer Prashant Gaikwad said that over the past two days, hawkers at Bhaji Galli in Grant Road and Sadashiv Lane in Girgaon were tested. “Several locals flock to these markets and therefore we decided to aggressively test the vendors and also shopkeepers in commercial establishments. Vendors could be Covid-19 carriers and so we wanted to tap infection sources,” said Gaikwad, adding that while D ward is mainly witnessing Covid cases s housing societies, on Tuesday, three cases were reported from slum pockets. The ward has seen almost 90 positive cases on a single day. When the infection was at its peak in the city in August-September, per-day cases had crossed over 100.On Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a virtual meeting with chief ministers and health ministers of high Covid-burden states and advised states to increase the use of RT-PCR testing for Covid-19 detection, and ramp up testing. “We should be proactive. Wherever necessary, micro-containment zones should be declared without hesitation,” the PM told the CMs.The ward officer of R-Central (Borivli belt), Bhagyashree Khapse, said that in a bid to ensure that their own staff is protected, the BMC has been conducting antigen tests on those visiting the ward. “The citizen facilitation centre is visited by hundreds of people daily. Therefore we are administering tests to them,” she said. “We also have teams of doctors conducting testing at Borivli railway station.”In M-west ward, officials said teams are informed in advance of venues booked for wedding celebrations and the 50-person rule is applied. “Permissions given to the concerned party are posted on local WhatsApp groups. We take action if we discover that celebrations are taking place without permission," said an official. In G-North ward (Dadar-Dharavi), officials said testing camps are being set up in areas from where cases are being reported. “Multiple booths have been set up so that the testing process is fast and smooth,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaimicro-containment-begins-in-mumbai-on-pm-cue-to-states/articleshow/81557369.cms||Richa Pinto

The offence took place in November 2020 and the couple used the cash raised through the victims to start a money lending business, said the police. Senior inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of Bharati Vidyapeeth police station said, “We have arrested Hiralal Agnyan (42) and Sapna (40), residents of Ambegaon Pathar, while they were in hiding.” According to the police, the couple told the victims that the central government gives interest-free loans to the underprivileged on small investments as per the Pradhan Mantri Dhuna Bhandi Kamgar Yojna. The couple allegedly collected Rs300 each from them after getting them to fill up some forms. The couple later shut down their office and fled. Mahesh Mandavle (50), a victim from Ambegaon Pathar, later lodged an FIR with the police. Kalaskar said, “Most victims are from Katraj-Ambegaon area. The couple would charge a small fee for the form and other processes. They would ask the victims to bring two more persons in need of a loan on the pretext of helping them. They promised an interest-free loan amount ranging between Rs15,000 and Rs20,000.” “None of the applicants received the loan amount. The couple shut down their office and remained in hiding but they were nabbed on Wednesday. The couple collected the money and gave the money to different people at a high interest rate. Further investigation is underway,” said Kalaskar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/couple-cheat-more-than-100-domestic-helps-under-arrest/articleshow/81557355.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Speed breakers on RK Puram road demolished after plaints||HYDERABAD: Twelve speed breakers constructed on a 100-meter stretch on the RK Puram road by the local military authorities (LMA) have turned the commute towards Sainikpuri as a nightmare. The 100-meter stretch leading from Army Public School (APS) towards RK Puram flyover is maintained by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) under the comprehensive road maintenance programme. On March 14, the LMA constructed multiple small speed breakers near APS after securing verbal permission from local traffic cops and Secunderabad Cantonment Board. However, the speed breakers have resulted in few accidents at the stretch. “A teacher fell down due to the speed breakers and suffered a fracture on her hand. She is undergoing a surgery for the same. There were few other commuters who met with accidents due to these illegal speed breakers. If the speed breakers were meant to reduce accidents, they have clearly not met the purpose,” said Chandra Sekhar, secretary, Federation of North-Eastern Colonies of Secunderabad (FNECS). Residents of Sainikpuri took to social media to express their angst against these illegal speed breakers and sought KT Rama Rao, municipal administration and urban development minister’s intervention. “@KTRTRS @DefenceMinIndia @greensainikpuri Speed breakers, which are 100 meters apart, are under construction near Army school on RK Puram road. This will badly affect commuters & result in huge traffic jam. Request you to either stop construction or open a spine hospital near RK Puram flyover,” tweeted Vijay Dabade. To this, KTR responded – “Request @arvindkumar_ias and @CommissionrGHMC to discuss with the local military authorities to find a quick solution.” The GHMC authorities responded to this and demolished the speed breakers on Tuesday. “Constructing speed breakers without written consent from the traffic police and the local authorities in illegal. Since the LMA did not seek any written permissions, the same have been removed. It is not advisable to have speed breakers on arterial roads,” said Anil Raj, superintending engineer, Malkajgiri division, GHMC. The authorities have decided to have a joint inspection of the stretch with representatives from APS, traffic police and Sainikpuri residents.  “We will conduct the joint inspection and then come up with solutions. As a measure, we intend to put more number of rumble strips instead of speed breakers on that stretch,” said Anil Raj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/speed-breakers-on-rk-puram-road-demolished-after-plaints/articleshow/81557359.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Mumbai||1,200 needy women push the pedal to hit the road to work in Mumbai||Mumbai: For 28-year-old cook Asha Shinde, cycling from Nehru Nagar slum in Juhuto her workplace in the western suburbs is not just the best form of social distancing, but also keeps her fit. For Lila Gore, who has learnt cycling over the past three days, it will now be the best mode of transport to the various households she goes to work as maid. Geeta, another domestic help, learnt to cycle in a day and is elated that now she has her own personal mode of transport. The Smart Commute Foundation, which encourages cycling in 24 civic wards, is empowering 50 such women from low-income groups in each civic ward, beginning with K West (Juhu-Vile Parle) this week. In all, 1,200 women in across Mumbai will be given cycles in coming weeks. They are being trained by expert cyclists and provided free-of-cost cycles to go to their workplace and back home.  “These cycles are specifically made for Indian women who wear sarees and salwar,” said Mumbai’s bicycle mayor Firoza Suresh. They are lightweight and the handle is low, and are being provided through crowd-funding. “My first bicycle was stolen. This bicycle was given to me by Firoza madam through her organization. This bicycle is very useful to me. It saves me a lot of time. The first thing is that we housewives don’t get time to exercise. Cycling makes me exercise,” said Shinde. For Gore, cycling now makes her proud that she is empowered to ride to her workplace on her own. “It was difficult at first to learn how to ride the cycle, but after receiving training from Smart Commuter Foundation, I am confident and will take the bicycle to work daily,” she said. Said Firoza: “I have undertaken this campaign because I think it’s amazing that a cycle can completely transform the life of a woman. They are not only a low-cost and effective game-changer, but also give a big boost to the confidence of women and help them economically. The other unique factor is that many of these women who get a cycle are those who have never ridden one before. Teaching them cycling and then giving them a cycle will have a massive impact.” The cost of teaching each woman, giving each a cycle and monitoring the project is Rs 8,000 a person. “This has an impact not just for a month or year, but for a lifetime...,” Firoza said. Smart Commute Foundation is involved in projects that promote a healthier, greener and happier city by encouraging people to adopt cycling as a means of daily commute, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/1200-needy-women-push-the-pedal-to-hit-the-road-to-work-in-mumbai/articleshow/81558720.cms||Somit Sen
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Balashankar insists there's a secret BJP-CPM deal in select seats||Thiruvananthapuram: Senior BJP and RSS leaders rejected on Wednesday a claim made by a Sangh Parivar veteran that BJP had struck a secret deal with CPM to deny him a ticket to contest the upcoming assembly elections. Rejecting R Balashankar’s statement that RSS had initially supported him for Chengannur seat, RSS state unit head Gopalankutty Master said the outfit never decides election candidates. “It is BJP that decides whom it should field in elections. It is wrong to say that RSS had promised anyone help to secure a seat. There is no point in dragging RSS into this sort of controversy. I would also like to correct the media perception that Balashankar is an RSS ideologue. It is true that he served as the editor of ‘Organiser’ once. But that doesn’t make him an RSS ideologue,” Master said. He said many non-RSS men, too, had served as the editor of the magazine in the past. But despite attempts by Sangh Parivar units to dismiss allegations that it is secretly lining up a deal with CPM, Balashankar stuck to his charges. In a tit-for-tat response to Master, Balashankar told TV channels later on Wednesday said RSS prantha karyavahak Gopalankutty Master might have gotten out of the habit of reading Organiser as he was saying its editor doesn’t have RSS connections. “Because of the respect for the position he holds, and for his age, I don’t want to say anything more,” he said. “It’s true that I had not met Gopalankutty Master seeking support. But I did meet other RSS leaders and they had promised all support,” he said. Union minister V Muraleedharan said Balashankar’s allegations should be seen only as a natural outburst from someone who has been denied a ticket. BJP state president K Surendran also denied the charges levelled by Balashankar, saying he would have managed to secure a seat if he really had the kind of influence over the party central leadership that the media claimed. “I don’t know on what basis he raised the allegations. The state leadership had only suggested candidates for each seat. The decision on who should contest in which seat was taken by the central leadership,” Surendran told reporters in Konni. BJP national spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal said Balashankar’s allegations were baseless. Agarwal said the real understanding was between LDF and UDF, and that they transfer votes to each other in order to prevent BJP from coming to power. “This time it will not happen,” he said. BJP is contesting the elections to win in all seats, it never enters into deals with parties not officially linked to the NDA, he said. CPM acting state secretary A Vijayaraghavan, too, denied Balashankar’s allegation that CPM and BJP were engaged in a secret deal, saying the statement was “childish”. BJP had won one seat in the last assembly elections in the state, and LDF’s attempt is to ensure that even that seat is wrested back. LDF has been adopting an unwavering stand against BJP throughout the past, it is Congress that has been hobnobbing with BJP, he said.

---||Mumbai||ED attaches assets worth Rs 32 crore of three TV channels||MUMBAI: Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached properties worth Rs 32 crore of three TV channels in a money laundering case connected with the Television Rating Points (TRP) manipulation scam. The properties belong to Fakt Marathi, Box Cinema and Maha Movie channels and include land and commercial and residential units located in Mumbai, Indore, Delhi and Gurgaon, besides bank balance. ED may file its first chargesheet in the case against the three channels next week. The chargesheet may also mention all the other TV channels investigated in the case. The ED alleged the three channels had generated Rs 46 crore advertisements in the last couple of years using manipulated TRP. Officials stated Box Cinema and Maha Movie had generated 25% of their total TRP in Mumbai with the help of five houses where the barometers were installed, while Fakt Marathi had generated 12 % of its total TRP from the same number of houses (with barometer). An official stated these compromised households would keep the specified channels on all the time, helping to boost their ratings. “The TRP was calculated on the basis of the total time period a particular channel had been watched, and not according to the number of households,” he said. The agency is probing the money laundering charges based on the Mumbai police FIR in the TRP fraud. Police found the involvement of six channels—Republic TV, Fakt Marathi, Box Cinema, News Nation, Maha Movie and Wow music channel in inflating viewership figures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-attaches-assets-worth-rs-32cr-of-three-tv-channels/articleshow/81557418.cms||Vijay V Singh

I will ensure that the official is removed,” said Balaji amid loud cheer from the crowd. MNM chief Kamal Haasan tweeted saying the DMK candidate has promised to start swindling river sand soon after winning the election. But his party functionaries have gone to court against illegal sand mining. Following this, Senthil Balaji clarified that the government had failed to streamline the process of taking river sand using bullock carts for local needs. He accused the government and the local minister of not preventing illegal sand mining at night. He said bullock carts are allowed to take sand for local use in Trichy and Namakkal but the same is prevented in Karur to benefit the sand smugglers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/we-will-allow-bullock-carts-to-take-river-sand-dmk-candidate-senthil-balaji/articleshow/81558721.cms||---
---||Pune||IUCAA scientists spot g-wave signal levels that can unlock mysteries of universe formation||PUNE: The team put constraints on the possible signal levels of gravitational waves generated by distant astrophysical sources, an official statement from IUCAA has said. Th discovery is important to cosmology, and would provide an explanation about how the universe evolved, formation of galaxy clusters and other structures in the universe. Scientists from both organisations have played a big role in the analysis by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration. The team was led by IUCAA’s Shivaraj Kandhasamy. He said since the first detection of the binary black hole merger GW150914, which confirmed Einstein's theory, the LIGO-Virgo Detector network has observed more waves from many binary black hole mergers and a couple of binary neutron star mergers. “But, these events represent only a small fraction of the total number of binary black hole and binary neutron star mergers happening in the universe,” he said. Researchers have not been able to detect each weak signal or individual signals when the merger takes place. However, the combination of these weak merger signals gives rise to a gravitational wave background. Kandhasamy said these different gravitational wave backgrounds are expected to have a different frequency dependence, so they should be able to distinguish between them. “In a recent paper, we searched for the isotropic components of different gravitational wave backgrounds. The isotropic component tells us how similar a gravitational wave background is when we look in different directions of the sky. Since the universe has structures such as galaxies and galaxy clusters, we expect sources of these weak gravitational wave signals to preferably reside in regions of the sky that contain these structures, giving rise to anisotropies (direction-dependent features) in the observed gravitational wave backgrounds,” he said. Researchers also expect to see similar direction-dependent features in the gravitational wave backgrounds where the anisotropies could give researchers insights into the history of the early universe, and explain how matter is distributed in the nearby universe. Arriving At A Conclusion Researchers used data from the first three observing runs of the LIGO and Virgo detectors First run spanned from September 2015 to January 2016 Second run from November 2016 to August 2017 Third run from April 2019 to March 2020 They assumed very little about the expected gravitational wave background Researchers searched for broadband gravitational waves with frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 1726 Hz that could come from any direction in the sky Quote “We did not find any significant evidence for a gravitational wave background. Hence, we set upper limits (signal) on the strength of gravitational wave background in every direction in the sky. These upper limits correspond with maximum amplitudes of the gravitational wave backgrounds that are still consistent with not being detected by our analysis. These upper limits could be used to constrain various models of gravitational wave backgrounds Shivaraj Kandhasamy I IUCAA Scientist I Analysis Team Leader||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/iucaa-scientists-spot-g-wave-signal-levels-that-can-unlock-mysteries-of-universe-formation/articleshow/81557371.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The Rs 468.1 crore project is expected to result in the rehabilitation of 3,367 households on a site spread over more than 15 acres. DDA has invited ‘request for proposal’ to select a private partner to carry out the in situ slum redevelopment of slum cluster at District Centre, Dilshad Garden on a public-private partnership (PPP) mode. “The eligible slum dwellers will be rehabilitated in 60% of the land area and the project will be financed by commercial exploitation of balance 40% land by the developer,” a DDA spokesperson said, adding that the rehabilitation project is likely to be completed within three years. “DDA is the state-level nodal agency for implementing in situ slum rehabilitation under vertical-1 of PMAY (U) in respect of JJ cluster falling on land belonging to DDA and the central government,” the spokesperson said, adding that out of the around 490 such slum clusters, DDA is taking up 376 slum clusters to check if these are viable for in situ slum rehabilitation on PPP mode. “A total of 7,500 EWS houses for three slum clusters at Kalkaji Extension, Jailorwala Bagh and Kathputli Colony are under construction and likely to be completed by December 2021.” There are 16 other projects consisting of 30 slum clusters with total 34,000 households, which may also be taken up for rehabilitation, out of which detailed project reports (DPR) for six projects, including the Dilshad Garden project, comprising 10 slum clusters with 9,600 households have been prepared. Tenders for these are likely to be floated shortly. The projects include slum clusters in Pitampura, Shalimar, Rohini, Hyderpur and Badli Village. “We aim to provide a hygienic, healthy and dignified lifestyle to the slum dwellers,” said a DDA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-dda-project-seeks-to-relocate-3367-families-from-slums/articleshow/81557410.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Candidates for three other seats — Kollam, Karunagappally and Mananthavady — were also announced by the BJP parliamentary board. Mukundan Palliyara, son of tribal leader Palliyara Raman of Wayanad, has been fielded in Mananthavady seat. The party had earlier announced the candidature of tribal youth Manikandan for the seat. However, he refused to accept the offer within hours after BJP released the candidate list last Sunday. Bitty Sudheer and M Sunil have been announced as candidates for Karunagappally and Kollam seats. Reacting to Sobha’s candidature, Union minister V Muraleedharan said he would try his best to ensure Sobha wins in Kazhakuttom where he finished second against CPM candidate Kadakampally Surendran in the previous assembly election. There were allegations that Muraleedharan and the BJP state leadership were trying to deny Kazhakuttom seat to Sobha. “Sobha is the most eligible candidate to win Kazhakuttom seat for BJP,” he said, adding that the central leadership had intervened in the selection of all 115 candidates in the fray in Kerala. Muraleedharan had lost the seat to Kadakampally for 7,000 odd votes in 2016. “We all wanted a candidate who could bridge this gap and win the seat.

He was 52. He is survived by wife, two children and family. Unfortunately, his whole family is Covid-19 positive. His wife is receiving treatment in IGGMCH and both children are in home isolation. Ustad Nasir Khan was working as a Sitar player in All India Radio, Nagpur Center, since 1988. His father Hamid Khan was also a well-known Sitar player. Nasir Khan started learning Sitar from his father as well as Pt Arun Kumar Bhattacharya of Saini Gharana. He also took lessons from Sarangi Maestro Ustad Sardar Khan from Gwalior and Ustad Latif Ahmed Khan from Pune. While being a top grade Sitar Player of AIR, Ustad Nasir Khan was popular across all music groups in Nagpur for his great skills of live Sitar accompaniment. Over the years, he became an inseparable part of the Kirtan Mahotsava, Brahmanad Music events of SCZCC, Kalidasa Festival, Vasantrao Deshpande Memorial Music festival etc. His has also performed in Italy, France, England and Switzerland. Ghazal singer Shishir Parkhie described him as a wonderful human being and musician par excellence. “He used to accompany me in many concerts. Unfortunately, he lost his battle against Covid today.

Rashtriya Kirtan Ratna Prof Dilip Dabir, who has been instrumental in organizing national level kirtan mahotsava in city, remembered Nasir khan as an artist who broke the religious boundaries. “His Sitar used to instill life in our kirtans. Performing a kirtan without Nasir Khan’s Sitar is difficult to imagine,” Dr Dabir said. Composer Bhagwat Tiwari remembered Nasir Khan as humble human being whose only religion was Music. “Be is Kirtan, Bhajan, or Durga Puja, Nasir Bhai’s Sitar accompaniment used to complete every musical event,” he said. Sanskar Bharati’s Ashutosh Adoni remembered Ustad Nasir Khan’s association with the group. “Nasir bhai had a close relationship with Sanskar Bharati. Whether it is Geet Ramayana or Classical Music concerts, his presence was fixed in our events. Sudden dean of such artist is a great loss to the art world,” he said.

---||Vijayawada||5 of 11 corporations to have a woman mayor||Amaravati: Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has decided to name candidates from weaker sections of the society to mayoral posts of all municipal corporations in the state. All 11 mayoral posts will be picked from candidates belonging to SC, ST, BC, Kapu and other communities. Jagan has also decided to appoint women to five of the 11 mayor seats, more than the quota prescribe in the Act. YSRC general secretary Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy said they have decided to release the official list of candidates for mayors, deputy mayors, chairpersons and vice-chairpersons a few hours before the election on Thursday. “We wanted to release the list on Wednesday itself. However, the exercise is taking a little time due to the chief minister’s insistence on giving priority to weaker sections,” said Sajjala. He said the election of chairpersons of Tadipatri in Anantapur and Mydukur in Kadapa district might be done through toss as the strength of both YSRC and TDP are equal in the two councils. “YSRC will not resort to unethical practices to win chairperson posts at any cost,” he added. Sources said the selection process got delayed due to the chief minister’s preoccupation with official meetings on Wednesday. Jagan attended the meeting to select the chairman and members of AP Human Rights Commission in the morning. He then attended the video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Sources said the selection of mayors and deputy mayors has been completed for all 11 municipal corporations. Two names have been cleared for the posts of deputy mayors in all the corporations. However, the process of selection of chairpersons and vice-chairpersons for the municipalities got delayed due to which the official list could not be announced on Wednesday. The mayoral post is considered highly prestigious as it enjoys cabinet-rank status. “The chief minister is very clear on social engineering in politics by empowering leaders from weaker sections of the society. He has asked legislators to give preference to unrepresented big communities for their empowerment,” municipal minister Botcha Satyanarayana said. Housing minister Cherukuvada Srirangantha Raju said the party wants to take everyone along. “Politics in AP is going to witness a revolution in coming days. A large number of leaders from weaker sections are being groomed. This has never happened in the past,” he said addressing a meeting of corporators in Guntur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/5-of-11-corporations-to-have-a-woman-mayor/articleshow/81556056.cms||Samdani MN
---||Vijayawada||After loss, infighting the next problem for TDP||Vijayawada: Infighting within the city unit of TDP has intensified following the municipal elections, with candidates who lost the polls divided into two groups — one in favour of MP Kesineni Nani and the other against him. Most candidates have laid blame on key party functionaries for the party’s poor performance in the recently-concluded civic body polls. With around one lakh locals enrolled as members of TDP, the party has a strong base in the city and had won a majority in the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) elections in 2014. However, in this year’s civic body elections, there was a complete reversal of fortunes for the party. It was expecting a landslide win as a result of the Amaravati agitation and poor infrastructure in the city. Many candidates were deemed to be in a strong position a week before the elections. However, things took a turn following the infighting within the party and a press meet conducted by MLC Buddha Venkanna, MLA Bonda Uma and minority leader Nagul Meera against Vijayawada MP Kesineni Srinivas (Nani). Only 14 candidates from the TDP won their wards while 18 lost by narrow margins. Former corporator from the Bhavanipuram area, Yedupati Ramiah has taken to social media to blame MLC Buddha Venkanna for the party’s defeat in the polls. Ramiah alleged that communal disparities created by functionaries had damaged the party’s prospects. An alleged telephonic conversation between Venkanna and his followers, threatening Ramiah has also gone viral in the city. The corporator alleged that the party’s key workers went missing during the campaigns, which he said, showed they were not committed to the party. Several senior functionaries from the party have expressed dissatisfaction over alleged indiscipline within the city unit. They have urged the party high command to take immediate action, failing which many of these senior members may abstain from party activities. The TDP high command has taken serious view of this issue with party president N Chandrababu Naidu likely to hold a meeting with functionaries of the city in order to take necessary action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/after-loss-infighting-the-next-problem-for-tdp/articleshow/81556371.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Vijayawada||AP: Court declines relief to MLC for ex-officio vote||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Wednesday declined to give interim relief to TDP MLC Deepak Reddy to register himself as an ex-officio member in Tadipatri municipality. The MLC had moved court with a lunch motion petition for urgent hearing after Tadipatri municipal commissioner declined him consent to register as ex-officio member. Deepak Reddy had applied to register as an ex-officio member in Tadipatri municipality but the municipal commissioner declined consent stating that as per rules, he was a registered voter in Rayadurg municipality at the time of filing his nomination as MLC. Arguing on behalf of Deepak Reddy, senior counsel Dammalapati Srinivas said the municipal commissioner had no authority to issue such as order as he was not the returning officer. Standing counsel for the state election commission (SEC), N Ashwani Kumar told high court that as per the rules, all MLCs in the state can avail their right to vote as ex-officio members in a municipality where they have registered as a voter at the time of filing their nomination for MLC. Special government pleader C Sumon told the court that Deepak Reddy had attended the Rayadurg council meeting twice in 2018 in his ex-officio capacity hence his claim at Tadipatri cannot be entertained. After hearing arguments on all sides, Justice DVSS Somayajulu said the court was not inclined to give any interim relief to the petitioner at this stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/court-declines-relief-to-mlc-for-ex-officio-vote/articleshow/81556343.cms||Srikanth Aluri

---||Hyderabad||BJP wants me to contest from N’Sagar: Rajagopal||Hyderabad: Congress MLA Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy on Wednesday said some leaders in the BJP have approached him to contest from the Nagarjuna Sagar assembly constituency on saffron party ticket. He said he has not taken any decision on the offer. “They (BJP leaders) want me to join the BJP and contest from Nagarjuna Sagar seat. Negotiations are going for the last few days in this direction. Only the BJP can defeat the ruling TRS in Telangana,” he said. Rajagopal went on to say that Congress strongman and seven-time MLA K Jana Reddy will be reduced to third place if he enters the electoral fray from the BJP in Nagarjuna Sagar. The bypoll to the constituency will be held on April 17 and counting of votes would be taken up on May 2. However, the BJP reacted sharply to Rajagopal’s comments. “BJP is a national party and is bound by principles. There is a method of electoral process within the party. BJP neither offers or reaches out to any individual to contest on its ticket, especially not those who are elected representatives from other parties,” said BJP chief spokesperson K Krishna Saagar Rao. Rajagopal, who won from Munugode constituency in 2018 assembly polls, had announced his intentions to join the BJP two years ago but did not join the party. He had criticised Congress as a sinking ship. Several factors did not work in favour of Rajagopal to join the BJP. Unlike the merger of CLP into TRSLP and TDP parliamentary party into BJP parliamentary party, Rajagopal is the lone MLA from Congress desiring to join the BJP. His defection would certainly attract anti-defection law resulting in his disqualification. However, his repeated statements that BJP is the only party which can take on the TRS in Telangana has become a matter of embarrassment for Congress as Rajagopal has not quit the grand old party. On its part, the Congress does not want to give any opportunity to Rajagopal to blame it for leaving the party and thus is avoiding any disciplinary action against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-wants-me-to-contest-from-nsagar-rajagopal/articleshow/81557415.cms||Roushan Ali

Jagan, who joined the PM’s virtual conference with chief ministers and lieutenant governors on Covid-19 management and vaccination, told Modi that all government hospitals and some selected private hospitals are engaged in the vaccination drive. The vaccine is being given free of cost to people as categorised by the central government, he said. Later, the CM held a review meeting with officials on Covid-19 vaccination. He asked officials to conduct MPTC and ZPTC elections at the earliest and wanted them to convey the government’s preparedness for the elections to the governor, high court, and state election commission. The elections were stopped by SEC in March 2020 due to Covid-19. The high court has directed SEC to declare the unanimous elections and issue required declaration forms to winners in these elections, before resuming them. The CM instructed officials to include village secretariats as a unit in vaccine drive and focus on completing vaccination for those under purview of each village/ward secretariat to reach the target. He stated that vaccines should be given immediately to those above 45 years of age suffering from chronic diseases, along with senior citizens aged above 60. Rather than treating those infected with the virus, the focus should be on preventative measures against the virus, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pm-briefed-by-jagan-on-vaccination-drive-in-ap/articleshow/81556087.cms||---

The data shows that 28 underage drivers lost their lives in 2020. The number was 54 in 2019 and 76 in 2018. To curb the menace, the traffic directorate has decided to kick off a special drive against underage driving in the state. “There is a rising trend of underage driving. This causes road accidents, sometimes fatal. Despite not having a valid driving license and experience, kids are given scooters and motorbikes,” said Kewal Khurana, DIG, traffic directorate. Under the special drive, cops are going to visit schools in Dehradun and other cities in the state to identify the school children who go to school riding their two-wheelers or driving their cars. “Traffic police are going to take action against parents/guardians who give vehicles to children below 18 years of age,” said Khurana. It is to be noted that under section 199 (a) of the Motor Vehicle Act, in case of an offence committed by a juvenile, the guardian of the accused or the owner of the vehicle is deemed guilty of the contravention and is liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/158-underage-drivers-killed-in-road-accidents-in-last-3-yrs-in-ukhand-traffic-directorate-to-start-drive-against-menace/articleshow/81556225.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Delhi||South corpn resumes drive against illegal spas, parlours||New Delhi: After shutting down 119 illegal spas till last December for violation of norms, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has again started a drive to act against spas and parlours operating without a health trade licence. Last week, SDMC’s public health department sealed four spas in Dwarka for violating norms, said a senior official. “We are identifying such facilities at other places, too, preparing a list and taking police help during action. Those with licence will get a showcause notice for violation of any norm before any action. In case of unlicensed ones, we issue a closure notice or a challan first,” said the official. “After the strict action last year, many people had shut down their illegal complexes to avoid sealing by the corporation. The current survey aims to stop such illegal activities completely,” said another official. “Our teams also verify that the massage parlours/spas with licences are adhering to the norms.” Conditions such as hygiene, cubicle size, medical fitness of therapists and an assurance that workers are not suffering from communicable diseases are part of the licence norms. “A spa is a place where mineral-rich spring water is to be used to give medicinal treatments for problems like arthritis, and muscular, cervical and back pain,” said the official. Infections such as Pontiac fever and amoebiasis as well as physical injuries may occur if a spa pool is not maintained properly, said another official. In September 2019, the civic body thought about action against spas and massage parlours allowing cross-gender massages and for not having CCTV cameras. “A committee was also formed after the direction from the lieutenant governor and meetings with Delhi government officials, but there is no outcome so far,” said the official. Checking the installation of CCTV cameras only at the reception is part of the law and order issues and falls under the jurisdiction of Delhi Police. “But the cameras are not required in other areas to maintain privacy,” said the official. Last year, the spa licence fee was revised by 20% depending on their star ratings and facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/south-corpn-resumes-drive-against-illegal-spas-parlours/articleshow/81557442.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Dehradun||Another decision of Trivendra govt reversed; development authorities scrapped from hill districts||Dehradun: Uttarakhand’s new chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Wednesday scrapped his predecessor Trivendra Singh Rawat’s decision of setting up of development authorities in the hills, as it did not go down well with the people. The system that existed prior to 2017 will continue. Confirming the matter, urban development minister Bansidhar Bhagat said, “Today, we have ended a major problem faced by the people of the hill areas. It had come to the fore that people were facing problems in getting building and other development maps approved under the development authority system. People also complained that getting work done under the system was time-consuming and also involved expenditure. On the directions of CM Tirath Singh Rawat, we have issued a government order to scrap these development authorities in the hills which were made after 2016. The expansion of nagar nigam, nagar palika and nagar panchayat has been scrapped. Now, no approval of maps would be required in these areas. It is a major achievement for the BJP government.” On March 13, the new CM had formed a three-member subcommittee of the cabinet, headed by Bhagat, to look into the matter and submit a report at the earliest. On basis of the report, the CM approved the move. After coming to power in 2017, the Trivendra Singh Rawat government introduced the development authority system in the hills on the lines of those in the plain districts such as Haridwar and Dehradun for “planned development.” However, the move did not get along well with the hill people as they had to face several hurdles to get clearances even for small work. To get their work done, people had to travel long distances which incurred expenditure, and get approval for maps. On several occasions, locals had expressed their voices against the system. In the Trivendra Singh Rawat government, a four-member committees of ministers was formed and it recommended the system of development authorities for the hills as well. Earlier, four districts of Dehradun, Udham Singh Nagar, Haridwar and Nainital had the system, but after the Trivendra government’s nod, it was introduced in all the 13 districts of the state. Rajesh Rana, a resident of Rudraprayag, said that unlike the plains, movement in the hills is extremely difficult and passengers vehicles are not easily available. Besides, it took a long time to get even the smallest of works passed through the development authorities. “Therefore, people living in the hills were not pleased with the development authorities,” said Rana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/another-decision-of-trivendra-govt-reversed-development-authorities-scrapped-from-hill-districts/articleshow/81556314.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Tender of a different kind: BMC to quash FIR against woman who fled quarantine||MUMBAI: Caught between following the rulebook and adopting a humane approach, those in authority chose the latter. BMC officials have written to the police to cancel a criminal offence filed against a woman and her two children who recently fled a quarantine centre. An FIR had been registered against Bhandup resident Meena Gupta (30), her son Sumit (13) and daughter Arpita (11) for allegedly slipping out of institutional quarantine at Hill Grange Building at Hiranandani Gardens in Powai a week ago. The three were among 60 placed at the institutional quarantine centre. The three were tracked down to Kalwa and brought back to the centre. Now, showing their humane side, officials of BMC’s S-ward have written to Powai police station, asking that the FIR against the three be quashed. The woman had scaled a wall to jump out and had twisted an ankle. Officials got her treated for the injury while fleeing with her children. The BMC officials have told the police to complete the paperwork needed to be submitted in court to have the FIR cancelled, and that they not be arrested as they “are not criminals”. “The police have told us that they will finish the paperwork... The woman says she fled out of fear... We have counselled her,” a BMC official told TOI. An officer from Powai police station said the FIR had been filed for violating pandemic prohibitory orders. “Now, we will submit a report to court, seeking quashing of the FIR,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaitender-of-a-different-kind-bmc-to-quash-fir-against-woman-who-fled-quarantine/articleshow/81557452.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

The increase was 30% over Tuesday, taking the state’s caseload to 23,70,507. To put the spike in perspective, from March 1 to March 17, daily cases in the state have gone up four times. Also, Covid fatalities in the state have crossed the 53,000 mark; after the addition of 84 deaths on Wednesday, the state’s Covid toll reached 53,080. With 2,698 fresh cases on Wednesday, Nagpur city, for the first time, registered more daily cases than Mumbai (P 12). A one-week lockdown was imposed in Nagpur district on Monday, with people being asked to avoid stepping out of home unless absolutely necessary. In Mumbai, Wednesday’s figure of 2,377 cases was almost three times the number of fresh cases on March 1 (855). The worst-ever daily number in Mumbai was on October 7 (2,848). The BMC has started taking micro-containment measures, beginning with testing hawkers in south Mumbai. A state health official said Maharashtra conducted a higher number of tests, close to 1.2 lakh, leading to higher detections. Mumbai has not featured on the state’s 13-district list prepared by a Central government team, which said that Covid cases in these districts rose by up to 400% between March 1 and 15.

Perhaps staggering of office timings or efforts to reduce crowding in trains.” Additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said 60% of beds in the city are still vacant. But there is a shortage of beds in private hospitals. “This time the surge is occurring in high-rises. Patients are going to private hospitals, which are packed right now,’’ said infectious diseases specialist Dr Anita Mathews from Fortis Hospital, Mulund. With cases ballooning once again, active Covid cases in the state breached the 1.5 lakh mark. Nearly 60% of the country’s active cases are from the state. Mumbai Metropolitan Region added 4,811 cases and 21 deaths, taking its tally to 7.7 lakh. MMR’s Covid fatalities are now 19,995. In Thane, cases almost doubled within a week with 493 registered on Wednesday. Over 4,200 cases have been reported in Thane since the start of March. In Kalyan-Dombivli, 593 Covid-19 patients and one death were registered on Wednesday. In Navi Mumbai, 318 positive cases were reported, the highest in the last five months; with three deaths on Wednesday, the toll has gone up to 1,144.

Speaking on the resolution to thank the governor Tamilisai Soundararajan during his speech, he said that there was no progress in the state expect in Pragati Bhavan. “Progress can be seen only in case of the excise income,” he said, to which KCR objected saying that his comments were not acceptable. Even as Bhatti Vikramarka continued his speech alleging various failures of the government and sought more time from speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy, the chief minister intervened and said that the speaker has given him enough opportunities to speak. “Members can utilise the time and speak on various issues, please don’t cast aspirations on the chair,” he said Meanwhile, Congress member Rajgopal Reddy strongly demanded that the speaker allocate more time to Bhatti Vikramarka. Raising objection to Rajgopal Reddy’s demand, the speaker said, “Are you trying to dominate me? Do not exhibit your aggression in the House.” At this point, finance minister T Harish Rao intervened and demanded the Congress members to apologise to the speaker for their behaviour before continuing their speech. “We request you to save the interests and rights of other members as they too need to speak in the House on different issues,” Harish Rao urged the speaker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/war-of-words-between-cong-trs/articleshow/81557439.cms||---

They have prepared a four-point agenda to raise this issue through different platforms, including Delhi government’s petition committee and Supreme Court and also make this an agenda in the coming municipal elections. “Authorities in the past have failed miserably to address this issue even on apex court’s orders. It is no secret that encroachments lead to multiple issues, including loss to environment, cost of wasted man hours, fuel, efficiency and even life in case of fire or other emergencies. The loss may run into several thousand crore annually,” claimed members of ‘Save Our City’ in a presentation to the minister of social welfare. “To get some concrete action in this regard, we have decided four-step campaigns, which include calling a symposium on April 2 with Delhi government ministers, senior officials of corporations and RWAs to discuss the issue,” said Rajiv Kakria, convener of Save Our City campaign.

He was shot dead by unknown assailants on Tuesday evening. The investigation committee comprising former ministers Harsh Yadav, Brijendra Singh Rathod, Yadavendra Singh and MLAs Alok Chaturvedi, Neeraj Dikshit, Kiram Ahirwar and Vikram Singh Nati Raja have been told to visit Chhatarpur, conduct an investigation and submit its report to the Congress committee.

Cops have registered a case against unidentified persons and investigations are underway. A CCTV video showed the Congress leader speaking to two persons in front of a hotel, when the two assailants come in a motorbike. The pillion rider of the bike gets down and shoots him from behind. Parmar was first taken to a community health centre nearby, from where he was referred to the Chhatarpur district hospital. He died undergoing treatment in the hospital late on Tuesday evening. A livid Kamal Nath has demanded the immediate arrest of the culprits. “I demand that the accused be identified and immediately arrested,” the former chief minister tweeted. “Strict punitive action must be taken against them. The law-and-order situation in Madhya Pradesh is worrisome. Nobody is safe in the state today. Incidents such as murders, abductions, rapes, loots are occurring on a daily basis.

They said that since the past week, the management has called parents, especially those who are actively fighting for fee relief, to the campus and told them to collect TCs. “I received a call asking me to come and collect TCs of both my children, who are in class 3 and nursery,” said a parent. She said that she met with the senior management of the Gitanjali group on Friday and was informed that the school is issuing TCs to her children. “The management said that they are expelling my kids,” she said, and added that despite asking for written communication on reasons for issuing TC, she is yet to receive anything. Parents alleged that the school is targeting those who have been fighting against the management for violating GO No. 46. They claimed that about 50 parents have been threatened. The management of the group, meanwhile, denied all allegations. They said that although they are asking fee defaulters to clear dues, they have not threatened anybody. They said that about 3% to 5% parents are yet to clear dues. The education department said that schools have no right to issue TC. “A parent approached us claiming that the school is threatening to issue TC, but did not lodge a formal plaint,” said R Rohini, district education officer, Hyderabad adding that they will look into the issue once they receive a written complaint from the parent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/school-denies-threatening-to-issue-tc-over-fee-dues/articleshow/81557453.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The board was formed by former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat and has been a bone of contention between the priests and the government since its formation in 2019. Meanwhile, the Devasthanam board officials have already started preparations for the Char Dham Yatra, which is scheduled to start from May 14. The Purohits termed the board as a ‘threat to their religious rights’ and demanded full withdrawal with no amendments. They added that the previous chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat used to work as a ‘dictator’ and never gave any weightage to public sentiments but the new CM has a kind heart and will surely take decisions in favour of the priests. The teerth purohits also invited the CM and his family to visit the Gangotri shrine, which will be opening on May 14. “The CM has assured us that he will take our demands into consideration. We believe that he will respect our sentiments,” said Semwal. This is the second time since the swearing-in of the new CM that Semwal, along with his delegation, has met him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/char-dham-teerth-purohits-meet-cm-seek-withdrawal-of-devasthanam-board/articleshow/81556318.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Delhi||Don’t cheat people, take bill back: CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal appealed to the central government to withdraw the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill 2021 recently introduced in Parliament. At a protest against the proposed legislation at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday, Kejriwal slammed the BJP government for the “unconstitutional and undemocratic” move. “I appeal to the central government not to snatch the power of the people. Don’t deceive them. The country is celebrating its 75th year of independence from British rule. Is this your gift to the people in this 75th year?” Kejriwal asked. Citing surveys on TV news channels, the CM claimed over 90% of Delhiites believed the proposed amendment to be unwarranted and unacceptable. “The GNCTD (Amendment) Bill was brought to deceive Delhi’s people and to stop their and Delhi’s progress,” Kejriwal said, wondering about the mandate given to AAP in the assembly polls and the relevance of holding elections if the lieutenant governor was to be made the main governing authority. “The Bill says Delhi government will mean the LG. So what will be the meaning of the CM and the will of the people?” Kejriwal said. “The Bill states that all the files will be sent to the LG for approval. When our government was formed, all the files were sent to the LG. In 2018, the Supreme Court ordered that the elected government of Delhi should have powers because India is a democracy and so no file should be sent to the LG for clearance. BJP does not believe in people, democracy or the Constitution. Nor does it want to follow the orders of the apex court.” However, Kejriwal also declared, “Even if the Centre snatches our powers, even if it requires me to touch their feet and beg them, we will not let development of Delhi halt.” He added that AAP would continue to fight for the primacy of the elected government. Referring to BJP’s poor performance in 2015 and 2020 assembly polls, the CM said Delhi’s people had rejected BJP, but “they want to rule Delhi through unfair means. Across the country, they hold elections and then dismantle the governments.” He maintained that BJP was bothered by AAP gradual political momentum in different states. “Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana, UP, Himachal Pradesh, also want free electricity like Delhi. Rather than stalling the progress made by AAP, BJP should also work for progress, but their policy is: we will neither work nor let you work,” he alleged. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia characterised the proposed amendment as “designed to curtail the powers of the Arvind Kejriwal government and an act to stop the Kejriwal model from making progress in Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Punjab and UP.” Sisodia said, “BJP feels threatened because AAP is now getting votes in other states. Since our vision for Delhi is to reach Singapore per capital income level by 2047, it’s clear BJP proposed this amendment because it doesn’t want the income of the youth to increase.” AAP minister Gopal Rai too claimed BJP was trying to run Delhi through by subterfuge.

---||Bhopal||New & Old Divide ‘Unmasked’; Get Your Covid-19 Covers On||Bhopal: With the district administration making masks and social distancing legally mandatory at public places under provisions of CrPC section 144 due to a surge in Covid-19 cases, TOI continued with its reality check on Wednesday. Team TOI went around New and Old Bhopal to see how people are responding to the directives about adhering to Covid-19 protocols.The 10 Number Market in Arera Colony appeared to have the best mask compliance. Ditto for other Covid-19 protocol, like social distancing, by traders and customers alike. And, both shopkeepers and customers make no "excuses" for not wearing masks or violating social distancing norms.When TOI visited the market in the afternoon, it was quite reassuring to see 90% of people wearing masks and shopkeepers ensuring that social distancing is maintained.“Most of our customers come from well-educated families. They are aware of how they are expected to behave in Corona times. We don’t have to tell them often to maintain distance or wear masks. We have put up notices and pamphlets outside the shop, requesting customers to stand in designated circles,” said a grocer.Traders said they have observed that customers shops where the shopkeeper or staff aren’t wearing masks. It’s only at hotels or eateries in the market that people can be seen without mask, they said.The tough Covid penalties sting some traders. “We are trying to follow the administration’s directives but are penalised for violations by customers. The collector has again ordered sealing of shops for three days if any shopkeeper is found violating Covid-19 protocol, that is unfair,” they said. Some of them said that enforcement isn’t as strict in Old City. When TOI visited markets in Old Bhopal, their ‘grouse’ appeared to be genuine. Markets in the Old City present a picture quite in contrast to 10 No. Market.From Moti Masjid to Budhwara and Lakherapura to Chowk, barring a few, most of the shopkeepers and their employees were sitting without wearing masks. Be it showrooms or grocery shops or hawkers, most of the businessmen were violating the Covid-19 guidelines or making a cursory attempt — like having the mask dangling at the chin.These markets have their inherent problems, too, that are a drawback in observing Covid-19 protocol. The roads are so narrow in the core market areas including Loha Bazaar, Marwadi Road, Lakherapura/Chowk and Sarafa that social distancing is almost impossible to follow. The size of the shops is very small and even if a shopkeeper wants to follow social distancing norms, they cannot. Of course, that’s no excuse for the plain callousness that was on display at many places. When TOI asked a few people why they were not wearing masks, they gave weird replies to justify their negligent behaviour. Some believe Coronavirus won’t touch them. A medical store owner said that now people in Old City area purchase a mask only when they have to go to a place where they fear checking is on. Otherwise, they have stopped wearing masks. “Initially during lockdown shopkeepers sanitised even the currency note, but now they have stopped sanitising their hands, too,” he said. A local resident said that his relative used to take precautions and followed Covid-19 guidelines strictly. But the entire family were infected by Coronavirus. “So, what is the use of taking precautions and spoiling our today? If the disease has to infect you it will,” he said. The shopkeepers put their masks in order when TOI spoke with them, but they said that people in Old City woud wear masks only if Bhopal Municipal Corporation and district administration take strict action.Time to remind them of CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s warning of open jail and fines for the ‘maskless’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/new-old-divide-unmasked-get-your-covid-19-covers-on/articleshow/81557446.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

On March 15, Priyanka Ala, serving as GHMC additional commissioner (revenue wing) who is also the returning officer for MLC polls slapped a show-cause notice on V Mamatha, GHMC zonal commissioner, Kukatpally zone, for violating the model code of conduct. Apart from her, six other government officials — also part of employee unions — were served notices. The members belong to Telangana Non-Gazetted Officers (TNGOs), Telangana Gazetted Officers Association (TGOs)and Progressive Recognized Teacher’s Union Telangana State. All of them were given 24 hours to respond. “It appears that the leaders of TNGOs, TGOS and PRTU have given a public statement to the media and electronic media to influence and lure the graduate government employees and teachers to furtherance the candidature S Vani Devi contesting candidate, TRS party which is in violation of model code of conduct,” read the notice.

As per guidelines, appropriate action will be taken,” said Shashank Goel, Telangana chief electoral officer (CEO).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/zonal-commissioner-six-officals-served-showcause-notice-over-violation-of-model-code-of-conduct/articleshow/81557484.cms||Nabinder Bommala
---||Hyderabad||Centre rules out revising referral wages for Gulf workers||HYDERABAD: Despite the pleas of various organisations, the Centre has decided not to roll back the minimum referral wages (MRWs) fixed for Gulf workers. The organisations said thousands of Indian workers in the Gulf are affected because of the Centre’s decision to reduce the minimum wages in two circulars issued last year. Union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan said in Parliament on Wednesday that there was no proposal to further revise the MRW which was reviewed recently in view of the economic situation due to Covid-19.“The government should review its decision and do what benefits Indian workers,” said Bheem Reddy Mandha, president of Emigrants Welfare Forum. He pointed out that the Qatar government had enacted a law to pay workers of all nationalities a minimum wage of 1,000 riyals a month, 500 riyals for accommodation and 300 riyals for food. “But, the Indian government offered to send its workers for only 728 riyals (USD 200),” Bheem Reddy said. Responding to a question by a member in the Lok Sabha, minister Muraleedharan said the MRW was revised in Bahrain, Oman, the UAE and Qatar and fixed at $200, the MRW in Saudi Arabia was fixed at $324 and in Kuwait at $245 for work visa holders and $196 for domestic sector workers. The MRW fixed by the Centre gives the liberty for employers in the Gulf and the mentioned countries to pay only the minimum wage fixed by the government of India. Earlier, the amount was more but the GoI itself reduced the wages. Giving out figures, the minister said Indian migrant workers who registered on e-Migrate to work in Kuwait during 2020 were 8,102, in Qatar 8,907, in Oman 7,206, in Saudi Arabia 44,316, in UAE 17,891 and in Bahrain 4,175. The minister also gave figures on the number of labour complaints received by Indian embassies in various Gulf countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-rules-out-revising-referral-wages-for-gulf-workers/articleshow/81557485.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Dehradun||Chipko-like protest, felling tree continues together||DEHRADUN: A day after hundreds of women in Jakhni, Bageshwar, hugged a cluster of trees which are slated to be cut for a road, in a protest on lines of the 1970s’ Chipko movement, chopping of the trees continued in the area. On Wednesday, men and children of Jakhni joined the women in the demonstration and chorused “Chipko aandolan dohrayengey, apna jeevan bachayenge, jal, jungle, zameen ki raksha kaun karega? hum Karengey, hum karengey’ (“We will repeat the Chipko movement and safeguard our lives. Who will protect water resources, forest and land? We will”). The agitators plan on staying in the forest overnight to guard the trees marked to be chopped. According to the villagers, the trees on the chopping block include highly valuable species that are endemic to Uttarakhand, like Banj Oak and Rhododendron. They say felling these trees would worsen the area’s water scarcity problem and that they are being razed for a road that isn’t needed. “Banj Oak trees have great water retention capacity and play a vital role in conserving groundwater. It is shocking to see the district administration go ahead with the felling of these trees despite knowing their environmental benefits. We request the district magistrate of Bageshwar to pay a visit to the site and take a stock of the situation. We fear that lower-level officials have taken things into their own hands,” Kamla Devi, the sarpanch of Jakhni Van Panchayat, said. Hemwant Singh, a social activist and resident of Jakhni village, said, “For the 600 odd villagers of Jakhni, the only source of water is a waterbody in Thaizar. The proposed road, if constructed, will be adjacent to Thaizar. Felling trees here and concretizing the area will severely impact the groundwater table. Can the administration assure us that our only source of water won’t dry up?” The forest patch which is to be razed for the road is built on private land belonging to the villagers. It was planted by villagers of Jakhni years ago, who then started surviving on the forest produce. The forest now has a rich biodiversity, including leopards and several species of deer. A part of it is, in fact, regarded as sacred by villagers and dedicated to the local deity. No one plucks flowers or leaves from the trees in this part of the forest. Former Block Development Committee (BDC) member of Jakhni Joga Singh Mehta said that he had no knowledge of land transfer for road construction. “For the administration to acquire land or cut trees, a no objection certificate (NOC) from the villagers is needed. I served as a member of the BDC from 2014 to 19 but was never for a clearance of any such road. Moreover, the PWD had stated in a written document that a road from Manjhgaon to Chanola 'already exists', why then did the need for a second road arise? There are several loopholes in the construction of this road, which the residents can do without,” Mehta said. The road had been proposed back in 2008 but hasn’t been constructed yet because of opposition by villagers. Sub divisional magistrate (SDM) of Bageshwar Rakesh Tiwari said, “A stretch of the road in Majhgaon was cleared around four months ago. However, no tree has been felled in Jakhni on Wednesday. An inquiry has been initiated into the matter by the PWD. We will take further decision on the road after we get their report.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/even-as-jakhni-villagers-continue-chipko-like-protest-tree-felling-continues-for-proposed-road-in-neighbouring-village/articleshow/81556356.cms||Shivani Azad

Mirza Ateeq Baig made a video in which he made a tearful appeal to be helped. Mirza said he was in great trouble as he was not even getting food. The video of Mirza went viral after social worker Patkuri Basanth Reddy received the video in which the worker made a desperate plea for help. Mirza said for the last two months he had not got his salary and even his final exit was not taking place. Identifying himself as a worker hailing from Hyderabad, Mirza said he had been working in Saudi Arabia for the last three years. “How can my children at home eat when I am unable to send money to them?” he said breaking down in the video. Mirza said if he was not helped, he would be driven to an extreme situation. He said there were more workers like him who had not received wages for the last few months. The embassy took note of Mirza’s distress video and got in touch with him. “Embassy official spoke to him. Necessary assistance will be extended to him,” the embassy said on Wednesday responding to a tweet by MBT leader and social worker Amjed Ullah Khan. The ministry of external affairs also urged the embassy to look into the matter urgently and provide all necessary assistance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/embassy-helps-distressed-worker/articleshow/81557487.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

However, the counting process was delayed as bundling of votes took more than 12 hours. In the first round in Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda (WKN) graduates constituency, 56,000 votes are being counted. Election officials said the WKN seat counting may be completed by Thursday. At around 10.30pm, counting of Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar (HRM) constituency votes began.

We have to see how the counting of HRM seat progresses. If it is not on Thursday, we will continue counting on Friday also.” He added: “Each constituency has seven rounds of counting. After the first preferential vote, if the result is not decided, second preferential vote counting will be taken up.” Each round has around 56,000 votes. Results will be announced for each round.

---||Delhi||Banners in hands, AAP workers put the ‘aakrosh’ across||New Delhi: Amid patriotic songs, hundreds of Aam Aadmi Party workers at Jantar Mantar raised strong slogans against the central government’s move to amend the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, which governs the functioning of the elected Delhi government vis a vis the centrally appointed lieutenant governor. The dais had as its backdrop the defiant message of Aakrosh Pradarshan, or display of anger, against what the protesters saw as a conspiracy hatched by the Centre against Delhi’s elected government.Wearing party caps, though many didn’t have masks on, AAP workers had come from across the assembly constituencies. They shouted slogans and cheered as party leaders, including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, spoke. Many of them claimed the proposed amendment smacked of PM Narendra Modi’s “dictatorial attitude”. Poonam Singh of Rohtash Nagar even claimed that this was BJP’s revenge for not winning a single seat in the February 28 municipal byelections. Around her, party friends screamed, “Down with dictatorship! Long live democracy!”AAP councillor Rakesh Kumar said the GNCTD amendment Bill would undermine democracy by enfeebling an elected government. “We demand that the Centre immediately cease from this move to weaken the state government,” said Kumar. AAP workers said that they were determined to fight the amendment.A girl in a yellow top carried a poster that alleged, “BJP has targeted democracy when the people of Delhi did not vote for it.” AAP volunteers declared their determination to go to any extent to protecting the powers of the elected government and claimed to be ready for a long haul to pressure the central government into withdrawing the GNCTD Bill.AAP MLA Praveen Kumar said he came to Jantar Mantar with over 200 supporters to strengthen the people’s voice against the step taken by the Centre. “BJP is desperate since it performed badly in the assembly elections. It knows that in the 2022 municipal elections, AAP will throw it out of the three municipal corporations. That is why that party wants to weaken the government and obstruct its work,” added Kumar.AAP volunteers also protested against the GNCTD Amendment Bill in different places in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and some other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/banners-in-hands-aap-workers-put-the-aakrosh-across/articleshow/81557488.cms||AlokKNMishra

A group of parents had recently met school education minister, Varsha Gaikwad, with similar complaints.

---||Kolkata||Politics trends on internet, reflects poll fever of Bengal gripping country||Kolkata: ‘Mamata Banerjee’, ‘Khela hobe’, ‘Sonar Bangla’, ‘Aishe Ghosh’, ‘No Vote To BJP’: words related to the elections in Bengal are becoming trending searches on the internet. Data furnished by Google Trends showed that while almost the entire country had been following news on Bengal’s political scene, especially after chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s injury to her foot during her campaigning at Nandigram, Trinamool’s rallying cry, ‘Khela hobe’ elicited as much curiosity as Banerjee’s rival from Nandigram, Suvendu Adhikari. Banerjee suffered the injury on March 10. For the next two days, she remained the most-searched person from Bengal with people even from Tripura, Delhi, Karnataka, Goa and the Andamans checking the internet for updates on her. The key words for the search included “attacked” and “accident”, along with “Mamata”. But it is Trinamool’s slogan of ‘Khela hobe’ that remained a favourite among one and all. Whether it’s ‘Khela hobe’ in hindi or ‘Khela hobe meaning’, people seemed to be curious about the phrase and searches were made on all seven days in the past week. The north Indian states of Haryana, Gujarat, Delhi and Rajasthan, along with Maharashtra, showed maximum number of the search. The same week, it was not big names from BJP who captured people’s imagination. The most searched persons were Mithun Chakraborty, who joined BJP at the Brigade rally and drew a similarity with a cobra with himself, and economist Ashok Lahiri, who was declared a BJP candidate at Alipurduar. Searches on Lahiri also revolved around his career. The CPM candidate for the “hot-seat” Nandigram, Minakshi Mukherjee, apparently is far more searched than her counterpart and comrade from Jawaharlal Nehru University, Aishe Ghosh. Mukherjee, in fact, was among the most-searched people from the CPM in the past 48 hours. Dilip Ghosh and his “WhatsApp number” were suddenly a “craze” in the past week. So were former BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, who recently joined Trinamool Congress, Swapan Dasgupta, who quit Rajya Sabha to contest for BJP from Tarakeswar, and Sovan Chatterjee, who was denied a ticket from Behala East by the BJP. Among the host of actors, who have received tickets to contest this , Trinamool candidate Sayoni Ghosh and BJP’s nominee, Payel Sarkar, were more searched about than the male celebrities, such as Kanchan Mullick from Trinamool and Hiran Chatterjee from the BJP. Political observers said the trends reflected the developments taking place and did not necessarily point at a particular pattern. “While different parties adapt differently to the direction of the trends, but one thing is clear: everything will be monitored by all agencies. The beginning of the elections is still several days away. We will see a lot of issues and once the election kicks off, it will be an interesting scene,” said a leader associated with the social media cell of a party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/politics-trends-on-internet-reflects-poll-fever-of-bengal-gripping-country/articleshow/81557513.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Prime Minister reiterated the mantra of "Dawai bhi aur kadai bhi" (Strict adherence to Covid-19 protocol and vaccination for protection from Coronavirus) and said activities should be carried out to drive home the message. Chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, said that in the wake increasing cases of Coronavirus, night curfew has been imposed in Bhopal and Indore so as to control the situation without adversely affecting the economic activities. Markets and commercial establishments will remain closed from 10.00 pm to 6.00 am at Jabalpur and Gwalior, too. At places, where more Coronavirus cases are being reported, campaign has been undertaken to motivate people observe Covid-19 guidelines and enforce them strictly. Except for 10 districts, cases in the remaining 42 districts of MP, there are less than 10 cases. Chouhan said that vaccination is being carried out in campaign mode and people are being motivated for vaccination with the help of voluntary organisations. So far, 7.24 lakh frontline and health workers have been administered first dose and 3.55 lakh workers have got the second jab. Chouhan further said 355 samples of suspected UK variant of Coronavirus strain had been taken, 8 of them were found positive. After February, 2021, Corona-infected persons are being treated in home isolation through tele-consultancy. There are enough beds, oxygen and other essential items in the state. Fairs and community functions on Holi/Bhagoriya/Gair have been prohibited to control the Covid spread. In the 10 districts, which are reporting more cases of Coronavirus, it would be ensured that people wear masks and social distancing norms are followed. Chouhan said that maximum number of 2607 Coronavirus cases had been registered in the state on September 19. In October, the cases had dropped to 514 and on November 27, the cases had risen to 1,798, which dropped to the minimum of 141 on February 14. As interaction among people increased on commercial, social and religious fronts, Coronavirus cases are again on rise in 10 districts of MP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/except-for-10-districts-cases-in-42-others-are-under-10-cm/articleshow/81556375.cms||---
---||Delhi||Congress protests at Jantar Mantar, says Bill will make CM a puppet in hands of Centre||New Delhi: Delhi Congress workers, led by DPCC president Ch. Anil Kumar, held a dharna at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday to protest against the National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) Act (Amendment) Bill introduced by the BJP government in the Lok Sabha.The party said the amendments were intended to take away the powers of the people of Delhi, and make the chief minister a mere puppet at the hands of the central government. Addressing the protesting workers, Kumar said though the Congress presently does not have any Member of Parliament or MLA from Delhi, it was Delhi Congress that spoke against the anti-Delhi Bill first. “We, as a responsible Opposition, deemed it as our duty,” he said.He said the Congress party was concerned about the welfare of the people of Delhi and wanted to expose the ‘hidden clauses’ in the Bill, which would make a mockery of the people’s power to elect a government and representatives of their choice. Kumar said the Amendment Bill, when enacted, would allow the Centre to remote-control Delhi government through the lieutenant governor.Kumar, the former MLA from Patparganj, said Delhi Congress had come out to protest against the Bill first and claimed that the AAP government and BJP MPs from Delhi maintained a ‘calculated silence’, even though the Union Cabinet had given its nod to introduce the Bill in the Parliament on February 3, 2021. He said the AAP government made murmurs of protest only after Congress announced its decision to hold a dharna at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday.According to the DPCC chief, Delhi Congress would mobilise people’s opinion and create a mass movement if the draconian Bill is not withdrawn forthwith.Other Congress functionaries who took part in the dharna included former Delhi MP Krishna Tirath, DPCC vice-presidents Jai Kishan, Abhishek Dutt and Ali Mehndi, apart from others. “Congress has a history of fighting for the rights of the people and the country, right from the freedom struggle, irrespective of whether the party was in power or not. The party stands for the freedom and rights of the people,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/congress-protests-at-jantar-mantar-says-bill-will-make-cm-a-puppet-in-hands-of-centre/articleshow/81557503.cms||---

Ramzan Shaikh was found in a slum colony near the tracks and the stolen phone was recovered. Five ‘fatka’ thefts have been reported on the line since February and only the latest has been solved. On Monday, Qurban Ali (36) was on the footboard of a local around 7.30pm. It was between GTB Nagar-Wadala stations when Ali, a daily wager, got a call. He took his phone when he felt a sharp pain on his hand, where he had been whacked with a stick. He dropped his phone on the tracks and spotted a man atop a railway pole with a stick. “This was under a bridge barely 200 metres from Wadala station. Only someone from the slums dotting the tracks could have access so quickly,” said senior inspector Hamraj Kumbhar, Wadala GRP. Police tapped their informant network and looked through their files. “Shaikh was located at Bengalipura, a slum in Antop Hill.,” said assistant inspector Vishal Chavan.

---||Hyderabad||Nagarjunasagar bypoll: MLC win could give leg up to parties||HYDERABAD: The result of voting to the graduate MLC constituencies is going to have an impact on the electoral fortunes of major political parties including TRS, BJP and Congress in the run up to the Nagarjunasagar bypoll. The bypoll to the Assembly segment is on April 17 and the counting of votes is on May 2. The Congress has already announced its seven-time legislator K Jana Reddy as the party’s candidate. The TRS and BJP are yet to announce its candidates. Analysts said the entire political situation will change in Telangana if either the TRS or BJP are able to win both the MLC seats. Even the Congress will get a much-needed platform to build back its image if it manages to win even one of the two seats. The BJP is threatening to emerge as an alternative to the ruling TRS after its performance in Dubbak bypoll followed by GHMC elections. While retaining its Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahbubnagar MLC seat is essential for the saffron party, a win in Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam too will help it to go out with all guns blazing in the ensuing Nagarjunasagar bypoll. This will help it establish itself ahead of the 2023 Assembly elections. The TRS is desperate to show the BJP its place by defeating its MLC N Ramchander Rao from Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar seat and retain its Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam seat. A win in Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar, a seat the ruling party has never won, will give it ammunition to halt BJP surge. Congress is trying to prove that it is still a force to reckon with. The grand old party has lost consecutive elections since 2018 except for an improved performance in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Even if the Congress manages to win one seat, it will give it the platform to build party image. Observers said political equations will change even if a candidate from other smaller parties or an Independent wins MLC elections upsetting apple cart of major parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nsagar-bypoll-mlc-win-could-give-leg-up-to-parties/articleshow/81557498.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Delhi||Central Vista: Buildings to be demolished or remodelled not finalised yet, says Puri||New Delhi: Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Wednesday said the buildings that will be replaced as part of Central Vista re-development have not been finalised, even as he accused Congress of constructing “substandard” buildings like Krishi Bhawan, Shastri Bhawan and Nirman Bhawan, which are not fit for a capital. Stopping short of saying that these buildings would be brought down, he told Rajya Sabha that the government has not yet finalised which buildings will be demolished or remodelled as part of Central Vista redevelopment plan, though he added the government did have a masterplan.Responding to a supplementary from Congress MP Amee Yagnik on the number of buildings to be demolished, Puri said, “Let me tell you, Madam, that if buildings like Krishi Bhavan, buildings like Shastri Bhavan, buildings like Nirman Bhavan have to come down, will you be sorry because you built those buildings and they were substandard buildings and they are not fit for a capital city.” Puri also said, “You built those buildings. We are going to now relocate you...Madam, we will relocate you into a new Parliament Building where you will have enough place to sit.” He added that no heritage building will be touched.On Yagnik’s query about a counter-affidavit filed by the government in the Supreme Court regarding the project, the minister said there is a “context” to the affidavit and the government would be happy to share the same in detail.Puri reiterated that not a single “historical building” or “iconic building”, which is part of history and culture will be removed. “The entire narrative was built on ‘that this block will come down, that block will come down, that the traditional buildings which are part of our history and which are iconic, not a single of those buildings will go down,” he said.According to Puri, the idea is to bring all offices in the Central Secretariat complex, which will have space for 50,000 people working and connected through an underground shuttle tunnel so that transportation is easy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/central-vista-buildings-to-be-demolished-or-remodelled-not-finalised-yet-says-puri/articleshow/81557528.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||First-timers tested by prolonged counting period||HYDERABAD: The time-consuming process of counting of votes for the graduate MLC elections came as a test of patience for first-time voters. Many of them said they thought the result would be out on the day of counting itself. They were shocked that it took over 12 hours to open boxes, separate valid and invalid votes and prepare bundles of ballot papers. “It may take two to three days for a final result to be announced. This is a learning experience. I had earlier cast my vote in Assembly elections, but it was my first in an MLC poll. The election authorities should explore various ways to complete the counting process within hours. We are living in a fast-paced world and this traditional way of counting of votes certainly needs to be changed,” said voter K Subramanyam. A majority of first-time voters also exercised the option of marking their preferences for more than one candidate, but did not realise it would impact the prospects of the candidate they have gave first preference to in case none of the contestants get more than 50% votes. “I thought I had done justice to all the candidates who had approached me seeking my vote. I gave my vote in order of preference to seven candidates. Only later, I realized the intricacies of preferential voting,” said N Nageshwar Rao. For their part, some of the contesting candidates who made their electoral debut in this MLC elections complained over the delay by the election authorities in starting actual counting of votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/first-timers-tested-by-prolonged-counting-period/articleshow/81557514.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Students, teachers adapt to offline-online shift||KOLKATA: The teaching-learning process has come a long way since the educational institutes shut for the pandemic in March last year and the entire education system shifted base to the virtual platform. After a year of grappling with poor internet connections and a sense of alienation, students as well as teachers have managed to overcome the challenges and have finally adapted to the online system, now that they attend virtual classes regularly, interact with their teachers more easily and even appear for exams. Students at colleges and universities, however, still face more difficulty, especially science students who have not had access to labs for a year. Krishna Damani, spokesperson for South Point School, pointed out that when physical classes were suspended, the biggest issue was the online shift.  “But the virtual shift will help the integration of technology in education. It is a major milestone, which we could achieve over a year. But students needing extra care from teachers do face a setback. When we resume in-person classes, teachers will have to arrange for remedial sessions,” he said. Boards candidates are relieved that the government allowed classes IX to XII to attend school. “We can practise the experiments. Otherwise, it would have been difficult as I plan to take up science in college,” said a Class XII student. Leena Roy, biology teacher at Central Modern School, Baranagar, added, “Now, we are better equipped for online classes. Even practical classes are now held online. But students are missing out on the benefits of face-to-face interactions,” Roy said.  She is, however, hopeful the new mode of teaching would pave the way for future. The most difficult times were the offline-online migration. “I initially found it difficult to stare at the screen for five hours. Net connection was a problem, too,” said Ariana Sinha, student at Shri Shikshayatan School. Colleges and universities, where physical classes have remained shut for a year, do not see any possibility of reopening in near future.  “Science students suffered the most. Lectures could be held online but teachers had to visit the labs to perform experiments and send the videos to students. But it always helps to physically attend lab classes for hands-on experience,” said Lady Brabourne College principal, Siuli Sarkar. Though CU permitted PG students to attend lab classes, the state government did not.  “We had to shut labs for PG students as the state did not allow on-campus classes,” said Sarkar. Teachers pointed out online classes for students living districts were still a distant dream. “They are being sent only class notes, which they study,” said a CU teacher. Fifth-semester college students fear they might not able to attend labs even in the final semester.  “Without adequate knowledge, will any employer hire us?” said a student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/students-teachers-adapt-to-offline-online-shift/articleshow/81557536.cms||Somdatta Basu

But now, the district administration is poised to take things a notch higher. According to collector, Gwalior, Kaushlendra Vikram Singh, if things go as per plan, it would soon have the ‘City of Music’ tag, just like Varanasi and Chennai. The road towards that coveted title is not easy though, admitted Singh and added, “We will apply for the tag after a few months, once all the preparations are in place. To begin with, we have already renovated the popular Katora Taal; now we are putting together a fantastic light and sound show there, which would be an eclectic mix of contemporary and classical music. For any music city, it is essential to have a state-of-the-art auditorium; so we have completely transformed a dilapidated auditorium at Wada into a vast stage, where artistes would feel a sense of pride while performing.” Multi-pronged efforts are being made to showcase Gwalior’s musical heritage in letter and spirit, said the collector, adding that its unique credentials will help the city in this endeavour. “This is the land of Tansen; and Tansen Festival has already carved a niche for itself, internationally. We are seeking help from all the musical gharanas to build a talent pool, so that we can pitch for Gwalior as one of the cities of music. To create a buzz around the city, we have got the street art done with music as core theme. The idea is to instil a sense of pride in people and involve them in making Gwalior a smart heritage city.” It is a great opportunity for Gwalior to be listed as one of the cities of music where Varanasi and Chennai from India have marked their presence, said a Smart City official. “We are planning to take our candidature for the prestigious Cities of Music category by UNESCO Creative cities. The applications are likely to be invited anytime between April and June. Having established centres and credibility in the field of music, Gwalior deserves recognition at a global platform. Considering all this, we plan to submit our nomination through appropriate levels to get Gwalior enlisted in the prestigious list,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/heritage-land-gwalior-eyeing-unescos-music-city-tag/articleshow/81556406.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi
---||Dehradun||Denotification of Shivalik: HC gives chief wildlife warden 3 weeks to present report on steps taken for preservation of elephants and their habibat||Naintal: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday directed the chief wildlife warden to present a detailed report on steps the wildlife board has taken to preserve Shivalik, the state’s only elephant reserve, and the elephants in it, within three weeks. The state has also been asked to submit a report on the impact the expansion of Jolly Grant Airport will have on the Shivalik range. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Doon-based social activist Reenu Paul against the government order that denotified the Shivalik Elephant Reserve. Chief wildlife warden (CWW) JS Suhag was physically present at the hearing. Speaking to TOI, Abhijay Negi, the counsel appearing for Paul said, “While the CWW assured the court that the state was taking adequate measures to protect its elephants, including radio collaring them (to track their movement), the division bench asked why the Jolly Grant Airport could not be expanded in a manner that does not harm the Shivalik Elephant Reserve. Along with the state and CWW, the court has also directed the Centre to file its affidavit and has given all of them three weeks to file their responses.” As reported by TOI, the state government had denotified Uttarakhand’s only elephant Reserve through a government order. However, the order was stayed by the HC on the grounds that under the Forest Conservation Act, the state needs the Centre’s approval to divert forest land for non-forestry purposes. Citing the objections raised by the Centre in its letter that had asked the state to look for alternate land, the court had pointed out that there was no evidence to show the Centre had given its consent. The government maintains that since Shivalik had been notified as an elephant reserve through a government order back in 2002, the state needed only a government order to denotify it and not the Centre’s approval. Also, forest minister Harak Singh Rawat had said that the dnotification of Shivalik and the proposal to expand the Jolly Grant airport were two unrelated developments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/denotification-of-shivalik-hc-gives-chief-wildlife-warden-3-weeks-to-present-report-on-steps-taken-for-preservation-of-elephants-and-their-habibat/articleshow/81556392.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Forest fires in Kothagudem keep officials on their toes||HYDERABAD: Forest fires in Bhadradri Kothagudem district are keeping officials on tenterhooks. So far this year, there have been as many as 1,200 forest fire incidents. The fires, apart from burning the forest patches, are harmful to animals in the forest tracts. However, no incidents of animals dying in the fire have been reported. “Forest fires are a concern especially during this season. We have our quick response teams (QRTs) which rush to the spots to put out the fire in the least possible time,” district forest officer Laxman Ranjit Nayak told TOI. Information about any forest fire is detected through the satellite and forest officials are alerted immediately. From the mishaps, so far, it was noticed that in at least 700 instances, the mishaps had taken place in encroached forest land and the rest of them close to such areas. While these forest fires are said to be usually man-made as negligence on the part of those picking beedi leaves or passers-by throwing a lighted cigarette butt, there are also fire incidents which are not man-made. “There have been mishaps at places where there is no human movement. We are trying to understand how these are caused,” the DFO said. One of the assumptions is that the deer or sambar in the forest areas while moving in the forest areas might push a rock on a hillock. When the rocks brush against other rocks, it may result in a fire. Another assumption is that dried bamboo may also be causing a fire for the same reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/forest-fires-in-kothagudem-keep-officials-on-their-toes/articleshow/81557533.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

This is especially on account of outbreaks reported in five schools across the state, say official sources. Several hours of video conference meetings have been held across districts in 48 hours to figure out a plan of action and health authorities suggested reverting to ‘online mode’ of education to the state. Active cases increased to 2,101 on Wednesday from 1,780 a week back. Also, three deaths were reported on Wednesday, showing an increasing trend in deaths as well. Daily Covid-19 deaths had gone down to zero at least three times during the last month. The three districts, which have seen a jump of 100%-200% in cases, have multiple clusters in schools. “A lot of focus is being given to testing as timely identification is essential to stop spread,” said a health department source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-reports-240-fresh-cases-single-day-highest-in-2021/articleshow/81557556.cms||Amrita Didyala

Officials said dispatch of the fresh supply, to hospital sites, began on Wednesday. A shortage of the vaccine had caused pace of coverage to dip across centres in Pune city. But officials said the fresh supply will help stabilise the process. “Many due for their second dose have been affected by the shortage. Private and government-run units were all hit,” a PMC official said. Nearly 2 lakh people have received a vaccine within PMC limits. From this tally, nearly 1.35 lakh are waiting for their second dose. “We have started giving out the doses we got. We have also asked the state government for more,” Vaishali Jadhav, a senior health official of the PMC, said. In Pimpri Chinchwad, PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil said the civic body was sent nearly 10,000 doses each of Covishield and Covaxin earlier this week. Patil said there's no shortage of vaccines in the twin towns. According to a report prepared by the district health office, nearly 63,690 healthcare, frontline workers and citizens have been administered the first shot in Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits. Another 9,000 healthcare and frontline staffers have been given their second dose of the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-gets-booster-supply-of-5000-covishield-shots/articleshow/81557544.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Hyderabad||Covid-19 virus peaked in November in Hyderabad, on decline now, reveals CCMB-IICT study||HYDERABAD: A research study based on viral load in municipal wastewater by scientists including those from city-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) shows that Covid-19 was at its peak in Hyderabad in November 2020, but declined in December, only to rise in February 2021. However, since March 1 the pandemic virus is once again on the decline. According to the study, the number of infected individuals in July 2020 was 676 in the study area comprising Tarnaka, Habsiguda, HMT Nagar and Nacharam. When extrapolated, the number of infected individuals in Hyderabad was 67,606. Active phase individuals numbered 322 in the study area and 32,195 in the city. The number of infected individuals in October 2020 was more or less similar to that in July 2020, wherein infected/active phase individuals in the study area and the entire city were 622/296 and 62,153/26,597, respectively. “Marginal variation from July to October indicates the consistent spread of the enteric viral load among the community. However, in November 2020, the infection rose significantly (infected/active, 3,513/1,673 in study area) and 3.51lakh/1.67lakh in the city. A substantial increment in the number of infected individuals in November 2020 suggested widespread pandemic infection in the community,” the study said. Apart from CCMB and IICT, researchers from the Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, Ghaziabad, were also part of the study. The results were published in online research server MedRxiv. “A higher number of infected individuals were reported in November 2020 and the lowest infection in January 2021 and March 2021. The repeated detection of the viral RNA over the months in sewage indicates infection severity and persistence of the pandemic virus,” the study said. The research group took up a study covering a population of about 1.8 lakh. The samples were analysed over six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-virus-peaked-in-nov-in-city-on-decline-now-reveals-ccmb-iict-study/articleshow/81557540.cms||Syed Akbar

Though the government had originally set August 27, 2022, as the deadline for the project, the timeline had to be revised as work could not start for 37 days due to a Supreme Court stay. Work started almost a month after the foundation stone was laid, sources said. While the work of new Parliament Building and the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue or the Rajpath and India Gate lawns is in full swing, the government is finalising the preliminary estimate for the first three Common Central Secretariat (CCS) Buildings. which will come up on the 25 acre land where the IGNCA is currently located. TOI has learnt that the tenders for these three buildings would be floated by first week of April. “The aim is to accommodate all the more than 51 ministries in nine CCS buildings. A 3.5 km shuttle route will be constructed underground to connect and integrate all these buildings. It will work as a close loop,” said a source. As per the Master Plan, the residence of Vice-President will be shifted from Maulana Azad Road to Block L&M near North Block. Similarly, the prime minister’s office and PM residence are proposed to come up near South Block. However, the building of the National Archives, which is classified as a heritage structure, won’t be touched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/parliaments-new-avatar-to-be-ready-by-october-2022/articleshow/81557553.cms||Dipak K Dash

Inlaks and Budhrani Hospital, for instance, reported having just 100 doses of Covishield left. But it has a staff of around 600 who’re waiting for the follow-up dose. A source from the hospital said, “We have some Covishield doses left. But this stock will not be enough at all. We’re talking about hundreds of people who need second doses, but only a few facilities are administering Covishield.” Dr Madhur Rao, deputy medical administrator at KEM Hospital, said, “We have about 800-odd healthcare workers who’re waiting for their second dose of Covishield. Some have been waiting for over 10 days now. We have started Covaxin sessions, so we cannot have another session of Covishield active. This is as per PMC directives. Besides, we have no stock of Covishield.” Dr Rebecca John, the assistant medical director of Ruby Hall Clinic said, “We have been giving first-time beneficiaries Covaxin since Tuesday. But our staff are waiting for their second dose of Covishield. And we are waiting because a site can only give one vaccine at a time. About 3,000 of our healthcare staff will be due for their second dose in the coming days.” While Covaxin is available at many hospitals in the city, Covishield has been limited to 11 government and 13 private sites. Private hospitals are reporting a shortage as many have to fully vaccinate scores of staffers who were given Covishield. A PMC official said the number of government Covishield sites were increased from four to 11 on Wednesday. “Rough calculations now show that even if 100 frontline/healthcare workers get their second shots at one site, the coverage will be 1,100 people daily. An eight to 12-week interval between doses of Covishield is permissible,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/at-pvt-hospitals-hundreds-await-critical-second-jab/articleshow/81557557.cms||Neha Madaan

The accused have been identified as Rahul Khan, 24, and Salman, 25, both residents of Bharatpur district of Rajasthan. They used to cheat people by faking their identities on online platforms, said Ajay Singh, SSP STF. The accused duped one Sohan Singh, resident of Rishikesh, of Rs 1.43 lakh by posting an ad claiming that they want to sell a car. Sohan Singh told STF that he contacted the mobile number given on the advertisement. "One of them even shared a fake id of an Army personnel in order to win trust. They fraudulently took money from him," according to the STF. On the basis of the complaint filed by him, a case was registered in the cyber police station under sections 420 (cheating) and 120b (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 66-D of the IT Act. "After preliminary investigation, the STF traced down the location of the mobile number given on that particular ad to Rajasthan. Subsequently, a team was sent to Rajasthan in search of the accused who were arrested late on Tuesday night," said Ajay Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/duo-held-for-posing-as-armymen-and-duping-people-through-fake-ads-online/articleshow/81556413.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||India||Go for occupation-based inoculation: Capt to Centre||CHANDIGARH: Amid rising Covid cases in Punjab, chief minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday urged the Centre to review its Covid-19 immunisation strategy and vaccinate all age groups in selected areas. During a virtual interaction of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with CMs over the pandemic situation, Singh sought occupation-based immunisation. He called for inoculation of school and college students and teachers, judges, bus drivers and conductors, panches and sarpanches, mayors, municipal committee chiefs, councillors, MLAs and MPs to pave the way for normalisation of key activities and check super-spreaders. He also advocated early opening of courts to end the wait for justice, and also of schools and colleges to bridge the gap between poor and affluent families in terms of education. Singh suggested that any area where weekly testing shows a doubling of positivity rate must immediately be considered for vaccination of all age groups. This would lead to better outcomes than the periodic cycles of vaccination targeting a small section of the population in each cycle, he said. The daily Covid-19 positivity rate has climbed to more than 5 per cent in March from a low of less than 1 per cent in January. So far, 1.99 lakh positive cases have been reported from 54 lakh tests and 6,099 people have died of the infection, the chief minister said. He blamed the surge in cases on fatigue or laxity in following Covid-appropriate behaviour, large social and religious gatherings and efforts at normalisation such as the opening of schools and colleges. Singh said the trend was worrying as the state had reported a total of 1,475 cases and 38 deaths on Monday, preceded by 1,843 cases and 43 deaths the day before. Punjab finance minister Manpreet Badal and SAD president Sukhbir Badal have also tested positive for Covid-19, he said. “We are making a policy, we will be more strict from tomorrow.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/go-for-occupation-based-inoculation-capt-to-centre/articleshow/81560454.cms||---

Webcasting will be done from more than 100 polling booths, which is 10% of the total 1,145 polling booths.To help the voter know the serial number on the electoral roll, his/her polling station, date of poll and time, the commission has decided to issue Voter Information Slip (VIS) in place of photo voter slip. VIS will be distributed to the voters at least 5 days before the poll by the district election officers.Bypolls in Sujangarh, Sahara and Rajsamand assembly constituencies will be held on April 17 and results will be announced on May 2. Bypoll in Vallabhgarh will be held later this year. The nominations for the bypolls, which will begin on March 23 and end on March 30 (11 am to 3 pm), will not be held on March 27, 28 and 29. New voters can still register themselves till March 20. Final voter list will be prepared by March 30.“Based on the security deployment plan, which will be developed in the districts after consulting the general/police observers (who will arrive here on March 30) and expenditure observers (who will reach on March 23), the number of critical and sensitive polling stations will be finalized,” said Gupta. “Webcasting, deployment of micro-observers, central forces and additional police personnel will also be finalized based on the plan,” he added. “There will be a 50-60% increase in the appointment of election officials during the bypolls.” The election department on Wednesday had a meeting with all the political parties, divisional commissioners and IGPs of Udaipur, Ajmer and Bikaner; and district election officers and SPs of Bhilwara, Churu and Rajsamand districts.“The political parties have been informed about ballot papers, code of conduct, when the candidates are required to publish their criminal antecedents.

The district health office said 9,241 people — including citizens and the health and frontline force — were given Covaxin as their first jab on Wednesday. The number of first-time Covishield recipients topped out at 9,038. Most of the beneficiaries who got Covishield were from Pune rural.Overall, 22,339 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the district on Wednesday, the data showed. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “We are rearranging sites in Pune rural that are still leading with Covishield. According to our new plan, Primary Health Centres (PHCs), which are operating on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, will now administer Covaxin. Covishield will be limited to the district hospital and sub-district hospitals. Essentially, we are going to use both the vaccines for first-time beneficiaries.” Last week, the number of sites in Pune rural increased to 140 (from just 40), due to the inclusion of PHCs. Deshmukh said the drive in these parts should stabilise soon.Officials from the PMC said except for private hospitals still facing a shortage of Covishield, the overall vaccination process continues to run smooth. A senior PMC official said, “Limited availability of Covishield has forced some beneficiaries to wait longer for their second dose. This problem continues at private hospital sites. There were reports of arguments between beneficiaries and hospital staff on Wednesday. But these beneficiaries were later diverted to centres administering Covishield.” Citizens who’re waiting for their second dose said civic officials should ensure there’s clarity on which vaccine is being given where. Radiologist Dr Chandra Maudar, said, “I got my first Covishield dose on February 16. The second shot was due on March 16. I tried to get it from the private hospital I had gone to earlier. But the staff there told me they were out of Covishield.”Dr Maudar said he then had to expand his search.“I tried several other facilities that were earlier giving Covishield.

---||Pune||Bapat roots for increase in number of vaccination sites across district||Pune: The Bharatiya Janata Party MP Girish Bapat on Tuesday called for a substantial increase in the number of vaccination sites across the district to speed up the inoculation exercise. He raised the issue during the Zero Hour in Parliament. “The situation is worrisome in Pune as far as the spread of the virus is concerned. Around 20% of the total cases in Maharashtra and 10% of the cases in the country are in Pune. There is a severe need to increase the vaccination centres to control the virus spread,” Bapat said in Parliament on Tuesday.A total of 136 vaccination centres were operating in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), as of Wednesday. They include private and government centres.Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol, too, said the number of vaccination sites should be increased to around 900 in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. Civic officials said all those fulfilling the parameters for setting up of vaccination centres would be allowed to start operations.“Many hospitals are willing to participate in the vaccination drive. They should be roped in to increase the vaccination. Looking at the population and the likely number of beneficiaries, at least 900 centres should be present in the civic areas. It will help in covering majority of the beneficiaries,” Pune mayor Mohol said, adding that a majority of the beneficiaries could be covered in two months if the number of centres was increased. The civic and the district administrations check the infrastructure of medical facilities before allowing them to start vaccination. “Three rooms — the vaccination room, waiting room and isolation ward — are required for the vaccination. A hospital should be available at the venue in case of need,” a senior PMC official said. “The PMC reviews the facility and infrastructure before allowing the site to be registered as a vaccination centre. Vials are made available for the hospital concerned for vaccination once it makes the required payment. The details of the vaccination need to be recorded,” Manisha Naik, a senior official from the PMC’s health department, said.According to the data, there are around 8,500 hospitals, including clinics, polyclinics and multi-speciality hospitals, in the civic limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bapat-roots-for-increase-in-number-of-vaccination-sites-across-district/articleshow/81557574.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Crammed schools and hostels an issue: Officials||HYDERABAD: As the count of Covid-19 cases across Telangana schools soar, authorities say that the decision to start upper primary classes has become a cause for concern. Reason: Lack of space to maintain social distancing in most government-run institutes at the district level. The situation is especially worrisome in hostels, officials add. On Tuesday, over 140 students from various schools in the state tested positive for Covid-19. Even on Wednesday, isolated cases of Covid-19 were reported from schools in Nagole and Alair, among other areas, forcing officials to test students and staff for the virus. “We don’t have enough dormitories in many hostels. After class 6 to class 8 started, it has become impossible to ensure that students maintain social distancing,” said a district-level official adding that younger kids are not following any Covid-19 norms. Parents too are part of the problem, claim officials, as many of them are making multiple visits to hostels. The situation is no different in private schools where many students and staff have tested positive. “If testing is done in all private schools, multiple cases will be reported from each school. Almost all schools have students with cold, cough, headache or some other symptom. There are many asymptomatic carriers as well. The best thing to do is to shut down physical classes,” said Bayya Shivaraj, vice-president, Telangana Private Teachers Forum. Though managements of private schools maintained they have better facilities, they said many parents aren’t keeping them in the loop if a student or kin tests positive. “We have enough washrooms, have regular sanitisation of premises. Not many cases have been reported from private schools,” said S Srinivas Reddy of Telangana Recognized School Managements Association. School education department officials said panels headed by collectors have responsibility of arranging accommodation if there is space constraint in hostels. Decision on closing schools or not will be taken by state in few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/crammed-schools-and-hostels-an-issue-officials/articleshow/81557578.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

While Delhi Police had claimed that Navreet (25) died after his tractor overturned, the family had been maintaining that he was shot dead. “So far, we are satisfied with the court proceedings. We are inching towards revealing the truth. Now the court has ordered the appointment of a board of doctors from Maulana Azad Medical College to examine the X-ray report,” says Hardeep Singh Dibdiba. Navreet was a vocal opponent of the three farm laws. A resident of Dibdiba village in UP’s Rampur district, he had returned home from Australia after marriage. Navreet’s body was sent to Rampur and the autopsy was done by a panel of three doctors there. The doctors in the autopsy report claimed that Navreet died of “shock and haemorrhage as a result of ante-mortem head injury”. “After collecting sufficient evidence”, Hardeep Singh had moved to the court on February 10. The matter was listed on Wednesday where advocate Vrinda Grover sought a copy of the X-ray report and post-mortem and inquest reports and Delhi Police had consented to it. Justice Yogesh Khanna also asked the doctors of Maulana Azad Medical College to prepare the X-ray report from the original plate which has been received by Delhi Police from the UP Police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/inching-towards-truth-says-grandfather-of-navreet-after-court-order/articleshow/81555121.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Tangedco had in 2012 obtained the Union environment ministry’s nod to set up the 1,600MW supercritical plant and foreshore facilities. Residents of the area said it would affect nearby lakes, agricultural land, and marine life and that a bridge proposed to be constructed as part of the project wouldn’t let traditional country boats with high masts through. They also alleged that Tangedco’s decision to drop using 100 % imported coal and to mix domestic coal (ratio of 70:30) could worsen air pollution. After residents moved the NGT, Tangedco and other government agencies involved said only 26% of the 1,3423 acres acquired was agricultural land and that there was no violation of environmental clearance or CRZ norms. Now, the NGT has directed Tangedco to do a fresh coal analysis and study the bridge issue.

The penetration of the platform in the Bengal market will be done in collaboration with local communities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Atma Nirbhar mission to set a new roadmap in the IT business of the state. “We have found that English is not the language of choice for 50% of our digital adopters. This prompted us to launch the app in eight different regional languages,” said Arnab Mitra, CEO of Digiboxx. “Our embedded specialised workflow management options will allow business to provide solutions like virtual machines, version controlling, project management options via advanced collaboration features,” he added. The business model of the digital asset management platform is to charge customers for file storage where they establish a cost effective data centre for business across the country. However, specific optional value added services will be introduced later for consumers. “Bengal is a special market for us. As of now, approximately half a million users have adopted our services. This is likely to increase as we ramp up our services. We are planning to hire around 500 local engineers to run our business. We want to see at least 10%-12% corporate consumers to come from Bengal in the next few years,” said Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/digital-asset-mgmt-platform-in-bengali-soon/articleshow/81557639.cms||Sarthak.G

Rejecting the BJP's allegations on phone tapping, parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal while replying in the house said the BJP raking up the issue to protect union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. He said the chief minister would offer his resignation if these allegations were proved right. "Not only the chief minister, all of us will resign," Dhariwal added. Dhariwal said SOG while intercepting phone calls of illegal arms smugglers stumbled upon the conversation of attempts from some quarters to destabilise the government. He informed that Vijay Kumar Rai, inspector, voice logger section, SOG, filed a report on July 10, 2020, reported that an attempt was being made to topple the government by poaching MLAs. Party chief whip Mahesh Joshi had registered an FIR based on media reports and the ACB is still investigating the case, he added. The Opposition BJP rushed to the well of the House demanding a CBI inquiry and the assembly adjourned twice for half an hour due to uproar. Dhariwal was giving his reply after the discussion on the issue during Zero Hour. He said that till date our government has not done any phone-taping of any member, whereas the phone-tapping of 90,000 people has been done by the Union government triggering protest by the Opposition. Earlier, Dhariwal stated in his written statement that under the Indian Telegraph Act 1885, the Centre and the state government have been authorised for telephone interception and public order to protect the security of the nation and the state and to prevent crime. Legal interceptions are carried out by units of Rajasthan police to fulfil the objectives prescribed by law. He said that this system is equally prevalent in all states. The central government also grants permission for inter-state interceptions when necessary. As per the rules, cases related to interception are regularly reviewed by a committee constituted under the chairmanship of the chief secretary. The state government has strictly followed these rules and no exemption has been given in this regard anywhere, he said. Minister said on July 17, 2020, the SOG filed three FIRs on the charge of destabilising the elected government with money. The cases were later transferred to the ACB. In this first information report, a person named Gajendra Singh was also talking to Sanjay Jain who is plotting to topple the government. He asked why Union minister Gajendra Singh not cooperated with the investigation? Earlier, initiating the discussion, Opposition leader Kataria said the charges of destabilising government were made to malign the BJP.

The two FIRs were lodged by Saroj Kumar Dash, Regional head of Union Bank of India, Regional Office, Ghaziabad. It is alleged that Pawan Sharma and his son Jitendra Sharma, both residents of Delhi, showed themselves to be proprietors of Jagannath Traders and Kajuwallah to siphon off Rs 45 crore from the Union Bank of India. As per the first FIR, Jagannath Traders through its partners Jatin Sharma and Pawan Kumar Sharma in conspiracy with other unknown persons cheated the Union Bank of India to the tune of Rs 25 crore by way of misrepresenting the facts and diverting/misappropriating the funds sanctioned and disbursed by the bank in the form of loan amount.

Not true, says state||MUMBAI: Taunting the Maharashtra government for seeking more vaccine doses, Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday tweeted that the state has 56% of its doses lying unused. The state’s public health department countered the claim saying it was ahead of several states in average daily vaccinations and that over 50% of stocks have been utilised. In a tweet on Wednesday, Javadekar said, “Maharashtra Government had only used 23 lakh vaccines out of the total 54 lakh vaccines sent to the state, till 12th March. 56% vaccines remained unused”. State officials said the numbers quoted by Javadekar were inaccurate as the state had vaccinated over 35 lakh and had received around 68 lakh doses from the Centre. Many districts, including Mumbai, will get a fresh consignment on Thursday. State principal health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas hit back at the minister: “You buy 10kg wheat and use 1kg wheat in a day. Have you not wasted 9kg of wheat? These tweets are good humour in such stressful times.” He added that as of Tuesday, Maharashtra was number two in the country after Rajasthan in terms of number of doses administered. Javadekar’s statement came a day after state public health minister Rajesh Tope met Union health minister Harsha Vardhan in Delhi to demand 20 lakh doses of vaccine stocks each week for three months. The state has an estimated 1.77 crore people to be covered under the prioritized population. Tope on Wednesday afternoon said, “We have not said that there is any partiality. We just told the Centre that we are vaccinating more and if the stock is refurbished it will help us reach our targets faster”. He said the state’s plan was to vaccinate 3 lakh people every day and with that target, vaccine stocks will last 10 days. Even as the war of words continued between the Centre and the state, most vaccination centres in Thane had to switch to Covaxin to conserve Covishield doses for those scheduled to get the second shot. State immunisation officer Dr Dilip Patil though claimed that there was no vaccine shortage. Meanwhile, Mumbai on Wednesday saw a significant 10% dip in vaccination compared to the previous two days. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said it was unclear why there was a dip in footfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai56-doses-in-maha-unused-centre-not-true-says-state/articleshow/81557656.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The awareness among people to demand for work also increased after the launch of ‘Pura Kaam, Pura Daam’ campaign.”“Some well-to-do families in rural areas, too, opted for NREGA work due to post-Covid livelihood crisis. The economic crisis and lack of employment have pushed them to poverty. Of the 15.24 lakh families, who have completed 81-99 days of work, at least 50% will complete 100 days of work, taking the overall number of families completing 100-day work to around 12-14 lakh,” said secretary of the department P C Kishan.There has been an increase in the average wage rate of workers from Rs 164.38 in September to Rs 168.82 in March after the launch of ‘Pura Kaam, Pura Daam’ campaign by the government in December last year.Last year’s 32.86 crore persondays generation was the highest ever for the state. The government of India had revised the state’s labour budget from 37 crore to 42.90 crore persondays for this financial year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mgnrega-8-53-lakh-families-complete-100-day-work-raj-breaks-all-time-record/articleshow/81557645.cms||---

It is the first incident where police personnel have been fined for flouting the Covid safety norms. In the first case, the woman constable was spotted by Gupta with her mask down at the reception of his office. He immediately asked her to pay a fine of Rs 500. Later, when Gupta went on the second floor, he spotted another woman constable with her mask down, talking to other police personnel. In this case too the woman constable was asked to pay a fine of Rs 500. “We are in the middle of an unprecedented situation and we cannot be careless or have an casual approach. It does not matter who it is a civilian or a police personnel,” Gupta said. “The spot fine is expected to send a strong message that non one will be spared for ignoring the Covid safety norms and spreading the infection,” the top cop added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-women-constables-fined-rs-500-by-top-cop/articleshow/81546103.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The court heard PILs, including one by four activists, based on CAG’s 2005 report, to declare illegal toll collection after August 2019 when the15-year contract ended. Questioned on how long people have to pay toll, MSRDC replied that toll will continue till 2030, as it had not fully recovered the project’s cost. It has to recover Rs 22,370 crore towards capital outlay, which includes cost, operation and management charges, interest, etc, of the project after adjusting revenue received. Petitioner-advocate Pravin Wategaonkar argued that declaration of capital outlay was a pre-condition while determining toll rate and period of toll collection. “The state has not declared the total capital outlay for the project and now says Rs 22,000 crore has to be recovered,’’ he added. The judges asked what was the actual cost of construction and yearly maintenance till 2004. Senior advocate Milind Sathe, for MSRDC, replied that the state was entitled to recover capital outlay. He said Rs 3,632 crore had to be recovered in 2004 towards project cost before the 15-year contract began. “We received Rs 918 crore (for the 15-year contract). We have yet to recover,’’ he added. The judges said the advocate general and additional solicitor general must be present on Thursday “to render effective assistance for a proper decision” on the PILs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/high-court-may-get-cag-to-probe-pune-mumbai-expressway-toll-in-mumbai/articleshow/81560779.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Amritsar||‘Bharat Bandh won’t stop for Holi’||BATHINDA: Despite the reservations of a few trade and transport unions against scheduling a Bharat Bandh two days before Holi, the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha will not only go ahead with it on March 26 but also extend it from four hours to the “entire day (6am to 6pm)”. The decision came in the SKM’s meeting with the trade unions, traders, arhtiyas, worker and farmer unions, transporters, and the associations of teachers, youth, and students at Delhi’s Singhu border on Wednesday. They’ll burn the copies of the three new farm laws during Holika Dahan on March 28. The morcha will also use the 90th martyrdom day of Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev on March 23 to spur a youth march to the Delhi borders from the birthplace of Shaheed Bhagat Singh at Khatkar Kalan. Darshan Pal of the SKM said the morcha had called upon the Punjabi farmers not to provide or upload their land records for the Food Corporation of India’s direct payment into their accounts. He said: “The FCI wants to buy just wheat based on land record, which farmers oppose. If the FCI forces the farmers to upload record, the morcha will take some hard steps. A similar call will be given to the farmers of Haryana when we are sure about the response. Punjab’s farmers have promised to support the plan.” Three ‘Shaheed Yadgar Kisan Mazdoor Padyatras’ (foot marches) will start from Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh between March 18 and 23. One of those will start on March 18 from Hisar in Haryana and reach the farmers’ protest site on Delhi’s Tikri border. Another will start from Khatkar Kalan and reach the Singhu border via Panipat. The third will be from Mathura in UP to Palwal in Haryana. A 400-kilometre foot march in Karnataka will reach Bellari on March 23 with the soil collected from the villages en route, and then bring that to the Singhu Border on April 6, where a memorial is planned for those who died in the agitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/bharat-bandh-wont-stop-for-holi/articleshow/81557642.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||‘Free warehouse of protesters’: Notice to Centre, Punjab||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has issued a notice to the Union government as well as the Punjab government on a plea filed by a storage company seeking removal of protesting farmers from its warehouse in Patiala district. Justice Lisa Gill issued the notice after taking cognisance of the petition filed by S M Logistics and Warehousing Company Private Limited, a Patiala-based warehousing and storage company. The petitioner submitted before the HC that farmers holding protests against the Centre’s agriculture laws are debarring the company from carrying on its business. The store was being used for storing goods of three companies — Adani Wilmar Limited, Capital Food Private Limited and Technova Imaging Systems Private Limited. However, according to the petition, the company has not been able to use the storehouse since February 2021, as the Bhartiya Kisan Union has locked its premises. Earlier the company had approached the Supreme Court directly but it was asked to first approach the high court to redress its grievance. The company has also alleged that the protesters have locked its storage facility, which is causing perishable goods from Adani Wilmar Ltd and Capital Foods Private Limited stored in the warehouse go waste. It was also argued that the company has suffered massive loss of around more than crores every day. The HC has been informed that despite several communications to the local administration, nothing has been done to remove the protesters from the site. But, during the hearing of the case, the counsel appearing for state of Punjab informed the HC that the local administration would resolve the issue. Directions have been sought to remove, relocate protesters from the site, as they are restricting the company from carrying out its business, which is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution. The case has now been fixed for March 23 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/free-warehouse-of-protesters-notice-to-centre-punjab/articleshow/81557643.cms||---
---||Lucknow||ODOP offers strong foundation for a confident, self-reliant UP||Prime Minister Narendra Modi rightly described the One District One Product (ODOP) of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as an “extension of Make in India” programme. Like ‘Make In India’ which intends to make India self-reliant, ODOP seeks to make UP self-reliant. Today, the novel initiative of Yogi Adityanath has provided a strong foundation for a self-dependent, confident UP. It has proved to be an immensely successful multi-pronged strategy of the UP government aimed at restoring and conserving dying symbols and traditions of places, uplifting artisans engaged in the making of those products, generating employments and boosting economy by promoting the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) and investments in this sector. Since the launch of the ODOP scheme in 2018, the economy of the state has got a boost while products, some of which were on the verge of extinction due to neglect by previous governments, have got a fresh lease of life. Some of the popular products of certain districts including Kalanamak rice of Siddharthnagar, terracotta of Gorakhpur and chikankari (chikan embroidery) of Lucknow have got the much needed impetus under Yogi Government’s unique ODOP scheme. The Yogi government has successfully achieved its vision behind ODOP -- generating millions of job opportunities for the youth and promoting the MSME sector. It has also helped empower artisans and poor workers engaged in the industry. Besides, the unique heritage of Uttar Pradesh has got an impetus and a global platform under this unique scheme. Since online shopping is the new trend in society, the Yogi Government has also signed MoUs with Amazon India, Flipkart and eBay.com to promote sale of traditional products. According to these agreements, all artisans, weavers and craftsmen associated with ODOP scheme would be connected to the international market through these online market platforms. It is worth mentioning here that these handmade products are in great demand in overseas markets, especially in the US, the UK and Australia. The agreement gives the under-served communities of Uttar Pradesh an opportunity to showcase their distinctive products and crafts to millions of consumers within the country and abroad. Also, these e-commerce companies are providing free cataloguing, marketing, account management, business information and warehousing support to the artisans associated with these platforms. Flipkart had earlier also signed an agreement with the Uttar Pradesh Khadi and Village Industries Board to benefit weavers and artisans by introducing Khadi textiles and village industries products on its site. Garments with traditional chikankari and zardozi embroidery are available on the Flipkart platform. Amazon India is supporting MSME entrepreneurs in nine districts of UP as part of the ODOP scheme. Amazon’s 'Kala Haat' programme has provided a global market for Banarasi silk saree, Bhadohi's carpets, Lucknow's chikankari, Kanpur's leather goods, Agra's leather footwear, Aligarh's locks, Moradabad's bronze items, Meerut's sports goods and Saharanpur's wood products. Amazon India has connected these MSMEs to crores of buyers from across the country and abroad and has supported traditional industries. Amazon is providing training, account management guidance, marketing tools, world-class warehouses for warehousing and delivery networks to these entrepreneurs. Besides, buying and selling products related to ODOP are also being done through the online platform ‘ODOP Mart Dotcom’ created by the Government. Meanwhile, the Yogi government is now eyeing the big craft markets in the US and Europe. The government is planning to carve a market for ODOP products in the fashion world through superior design. Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU) and National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) have signed MoUs with the MSME department in this regard.  AKTU is set to introduce a course on the art of selling ODOP products in the market whereas NIFT will specially design clothes, carpets, leather industry products and other items covered under ODOP keeping in mind the characteristic geographical aspects of the markets, the popular colour, material and quality. According to the agreement, the products will be designed as per the demand of the US and European markets as well as the big markets within India such as Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata. The Central and state governments are consistently rolling out schemes to boost the MSME sector. Due to such efforts, UP has emerged as the second largest economy of the country in the recent past and no wonder if it becomes the top economy in the coming years. The government has started branding industries associated with traditional food products to provide impetus to them. Taking special interest in this scheme, the CM has urged all eminent artists, public representatives and officers to promote the traditional ODOP food products and artefacts. The government also plans to promote the famous gooseberry of Pratapgarh, Fatehpur and Rae Bareli; mango of Lucknow and Malihabad; Surkha Guava of Kaushambi and Prayag; banana of Gonda, Bahraich, Lakhimpur and Shravasti; and jaggery of Muzaffarnagar, Ayodhya, Baghpat, Bijnor, Shamli and Meerut in this context. There are many such products which have been integral to the identity of the districts that are getting due promotion under the Yogi Government. These include Mainpuri’s garlic, green chilly of Varanasi and Deoria; Hathras’ asafoetida and the ghee of Auraiya or Kasganj. All relevant information related to the ODOP are available online. The Udyam Sarathi app has been launched by the government as an important link to help aspiring entrepreneurs set up units. By applying on this portal, artisans and craftsmen of the state can get information about the schemes of the Central and State governments, banking facilities and the ODOP programme at large. ODOP has also contributed towards empowering women of the state and making them self-reliant. (The writer is an economist.

Jaipur is at the 155 spot in the most polluted cities in the world, says the IQair report. The air quality in Bhiwadi, Jodhpur, Pali, Jaipur, Kota, Alwar, Ajmer has also improved significantly during the same period, the report said. According to the report, 22 out of the 20 most-polluted cities are in India. Bhiwadi in Rajasthan, which is an industrial town in Alwar, has bagged the dubious distinction of being the fifth most polluted cities in the world. It has an average annual PM2.5 concentration of 95.5 micrograms per cubic metre. It was followed by Jodhpur with an annual average PM2.5 concentration at 67.1. Jodhpur’s ranking in the world’s most-polluted city is 35th. Global cities ranking report is based on PM2.5 data from 106 countries, which is measured by ground-based monitoring stations, most of which are operated by government agencies. Dr Virendra Singh, a city-based pulmonologist said, “It is a pleasant surprise to know that the air pollution level in the different cities have gone down, which is a result of improved vehicle engines, more people not using wood as fuel for cooking, brick kilns have moved far from cities, habit of burning garbage in cities has been discouraged as garbage collection by municipal bodies has improved which have collective improved air quality.” The PM 2.5 is linked to air pollution and decreasing level of PM 2.5 has helped in improving quality of life of patients suffering from respiratory diseases. “It has been seen that the number of asthma and other respiratory patients’ registration in various hospitals decreased by 30% in 2020,” said Dr Singh. On pollution in Jaipur, the report said, “It has been known for pollution levels to climb massively during Diwali festival, with a huge number of firecrackers, fireworks and other smoke sources causing respiratory distress for residents in the days following.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bhiwadi-5th-most-polluted-city-in-world/articleshow/81557653.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra expert +ve after 2 doses, says probe if variants skirting antibodies||PUNE: The state’s technical expert on Covid-19, Dr Subhash Salunke, tested positive for the illness this week barely 20 days after he had taken the second dose of the vaccine. He is now among a handful of healthcare and frontline workers in the state who have tested positive despite a full round of vaccination. Last week, a doctor and a non-medical staffer of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital tested positive days after receiving both doses of the vaccine. Salunke said he has now written to the Union and state governments urging them to consider delaying the second vaccine dose for better efficacy and investigate the possibility of variants that may be escaping vaccine protection. Covid vaccination is currently a two-dose schedule given four weeks apart. The expert said he got his second jab on February 23. He tested positive on March 15, nearly three weeks later, with mild symptoms. He has been admitted to a government hospital. “There is a need to reconfirm efficacy of the vaccines. It seems as if the virus is bypassing antibodies in vaccinated persons,” he said. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said a staff member tested positive 14 days after receiving the second jab. Another tested positive 20 days after the follow-up shot. “This is a significant period for antibodies to grow and is a worrisome trend. Vaccine makers have not said the shots are 100% effective, but these cases need to be reported,” Kelkar said, adding that both staffers work in the hospital’s non-Covid department. Maharashtra health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said no vaccine is 100% effective. “As for the Covid shots, severity of illness will be much less in vaccinated people.” He added that they are following the scientific advisory issued by the government of India, which is based on recommendations by researchers. “Please have faith in the collective wisdom of our scientists,” he said. In an earlier interview with TOI, Dr Gagandeep Kang, a member of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE), which is advising the World Health Organization, had said studies have shown that longer intervals between doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield) improves immune response. “For this vaccine, based on the data we now have, it makes sense to give the doses at least 8-12 weeks apart,” she had said. Dr Salunke said there has been a significant rise in cases similar to his — that of people testing positive despite vaccination. Dr Kanan Yelikar, dean of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) Aurangabad, tested positive last week ten days after the second dose. She had mild symptoms. Again in Aurangabad, two doctors contracted the infection within four to five days of the second shot (both had mild symptoms too). Prakash Doke, former director of health services and also an advisor to the state government, said the recent surge in cases with relatively low mortality suggests a different variant of the virus may now be circulating in many regions. “We had seen such trends in the United States and the United Kingdom, of cases surging during the second wave without an increase in deaths.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-expert-ve-after-2-doses-says-probe-if-variants-skirting-antibodies/articleshow/81557663.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||India||Uddhav Thackrey to PM Modi: Allow Maharashtra firm to make Covaxin||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government on Wednesday raised a demand with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow the state to manufacture the indegious Covaxin vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech at Mumbai’s Haffkine Institute. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray raised the issue in the PM’s Covid-19 review meeting with all states on Wednesday. Public health minister Rajesh Tope who attended the meeting and later spoke to the press said Modi was positive about this suggestion. According to a statement issued by the Maharashtra government, the PM said institutes in all the states that can produce the vaccine will be encouraged to do so. Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh ad a meeting with Haffkine’s management regarding the production. A new plant will be set up at the cost of Rs 154 crore at Haffkine to develop the vaccine, said Deshmukh. The manufacturing will happen in two phases. In the first, the vaccine will be taken in bulk from Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and repackaged and filled at the Haffkine plant. The second phase, which will entail the actual production of the vaccine, will take over one year. A detailed proposal will be soon sent to the Centre for bulk supply of the vaccine from Bharat Biotech and funds to set up the new plant will be sought too. Thackeray sought for a technology transfer under the Mission Covid Suraksha from Bharat Biotech to Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation, one of the country’s oldest and premier biomedical research facilities. “If the technology transfer happens, either vaccine can be produced at Haffkine or they can work on a ‘fill and finish’ arrangement. Nearly 126 million doses can be manufactured at the Haffkine facility,” said Thackeray. “Haffkine has all the required facilities and it will also help boost production. The state will also demand that 25% of the doses produced at Haffkine which be reserved for the state ” said Tope. Thackeray has also demanded that more vaccination centres be permitted in the state and also to allow vaccination of all those who are 45 years and below, whether or not they have co-morbidities. As part of the second phase of vaccination only those with co-morbidities and are below the age of 45 are being given the vaccine. Thackeray has urged intervention from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to help the state find out what is causing the sudden surge in cases and the spike is sharp in a few districts. “The number of fresh cases were less than 2,000 in the state a few months ago, now the cases are on the rise in many districts and we would like expert advice on whether there is any mutation which is causing the spike,” said Thackeray. Meanwhile, the centre has directed the state to step up testing and tracking. The positivity rate of the state was 10% as on March 1 when it had added over 7,000 cases , in just 15 days the positivity rate has jumped to 16%, which the state adding over 13,000 cases on March 15.Of the total active cases in the state, 60% are from the state the Centre has directed the state to step up testing and also improve tracing of contacts. “We are testing nearly 1.3 lakh people /10 lakh population and we are doing over 70% of these tests using the RT-PCR method. While many states like UP and Kerala are doing much lower RT-PCR tests and so their positivity rate may be lower,” said Tope.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uddhav-thackrey-to-pm-modi-allow-maharashtra-firm-to-make-covaxin/articleshow/81560455.cms||Bhavika Jain

Kumar, who plays an archaeologist in ‘Ram Setu’, a movie inspired by the Lord Ram’s passage to Lanka through what’s called Adam’s bridge — a chain of limestone shoals between Rameswaram Island, off south-eastern coast of Tamil Nadu and Mannar Island on Lankan coast. Talking to TOI, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi, said, “Akshay Kumar will reach Ayodhya with his team and he will decide on the shooting locale as per convenience.” Ayodhya DIG Deepak Kumar too confirmed the film crew’s arrival on Thursday. Sources told TOI that Kumar, who will be accompanied by director Abhishek Sharma and creative producer, Chandra Prakash Dwivedi, is likely to shoot the mahurat at a location near the Ramjanmabhoomi. Dwivedi in a press statement from Mumbai had said Ayodhya would be the best location to shoot the mahurat as the temple town is the birthplace of Lord Ram and will augur well for the journey of 'Ram Setu’. Sources said, shooting of the ‘mahurat’ from Ayodhya was creative producer Dwivedi’s idea to spread a message about a movie on connected with Ram. The film is likely to star Jacqueline Fernandez and Nushrratt Bharuccha along with Akshay Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akshay-to-shoot-mahurat-of-ram-setu-in-ayodhya-today/articleshow/81558959.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Goa||Will be very upset when choosing four foreign players for AFC Champions League: Ferrando||Panaji: FC Goa coach Juan Ferrando has a tough decision to make. From among the six foreign players that he has for this season, Ferrando has to choose four for the AFC Champions League. From among the four, Australian defender James Donachie is an automatic selection, leaving the coach to choose three from the five Spanish players. While the Indian Super League (ISL) allowed registration of seven foreign players with a maximum of five on the field at any point of time, Asian football competition rules are different. The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has a 3+1 regulation, which means a club can field a maximum of four international players -- three foreigners of any nationality and one player from the AFC member nation, which includes Australia. “This is a very difficult situation. I will be very upset when I take this decision,” Ferrando told TOI. “Edu (Bedia) is the captain and part of the winning team last season. Ivan (Gonzalez) is the best centre-back and for me, he is very important in the build-up. I cannot leave him out. Alberto (Noguera) understands my methodology, he’s like my favourite student. “(Igor) Angulo is a perfect example of No. 9 and gets you lots of goals. (Jorge) Ortiz has a lot of quality. If you ask me to take a decision now, I don’t know what to do. Maybe I’ll change their surnames,” said Ferrando. Goa must register a minimum of 18 players, including three goalkeepers, before March 23. Seven days prior to the opening match, clubs can add or replace seven more players for any reason to complete their maximum quota of 30 for the AFC Champions League. “The idea is to prepare the team and see how they do in training. We will take a decision at the last minute. We have to remember that the Champions League will have matches after just two days’ rest, so we have to see who all are in the best condition. Some players are very tired,” said Ferrando. Goa have been placed alongside last year’s runnersup Persepolis, Qatar Stars League side Al-Rayyan and the winner of the playoff between Al-Wahda (UAE) and Al-Zawraa (Iraq), which will be played on April 7. Goa will open their campaign against Al-Rayyan at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on April 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-be-very-upset-when-choosing-four-foreign-players-for-afc-champions-league-ferrando/articleshow/81577079.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Nagpur||Deserted streets return as cops, NMC tighten screws||Nagpur: The 1pm restriction for stand-alone essential shops and vegetable vendors, along with stricter enforcements by cops and city civic personnel on day 2, seemed to have had a deterrent effect on people as well as vehicular movement in the city on the third day of extended restrictions. With rise in the Covid cases, the authorities displayed more desperation to enforce the stricter restrictions. People movement is expected to further come down after city police chief Amitesh Kumar turned on the heat on private establishments asking employees to turn up, in violation of restrictions. “We checked 25 offices and registered offences against one at Sitabuldi till 4pm. Action was also taken against a small mall at Dhantoli,” said CP.City police, under his supervision, detained 824 vehicles and Rs1.83 lakh fine recovered, 423 cases of not wearing masks were registered, along with 784 for social distancing.In the afternoon, Zonal DCP Neelotpal raided snacks vendor at Jaripatka following a tip off, and initiated strict action. It’s learnt the place is also connected to cricket bookie Pankaj. After the initial rush of office goers on the roads, the streets started looking deserted as the day progressed and temperature also started soaring, till the evening. Madan Gupta, a local trader of Sabji Mandi locality in Itwari, lauded the police efforts and also the nuisance detection squad (NDS) of NMC, as his lane wore a deserted look.“The vegetable vendors were removed from the roads and rest of the shops were not allowed to even open furtively by the NDS teams, which enforced restrictions at Itwari in a strict way,” he said. NDS team from Dharampeth zone also sealed the premises of interior designer Monika Patel and Associates, at Neeti Gaurav Apartment, Central Bazaar Road, for defying Covid-19 lockdown. An FIR has also been filed against the firm, said NDS commandant Virsen Tambe.The NDS team also levied a Rs5,000 fine on Bank of Maharashtra manager after long queues of account holders were found standing without physical distancing. The civic cops from Ashi Nagar zone imposed a fine of Rs5,000 on a person for violating home quarantine rule. The NDS team from Satranjipura zone too imposed Rs20,000 fine on two families after they were found defying Covid-19 protocols during marriage ceremonies in their houses. Rajkumar Jumani, owner of Mohanlal Laxmandas Kirana Shop at Mahal, said there was some rush between 10.30am and 12.30pm at his outlet but later it trickled out. “If authorities have taken a decision to keep the corona cases under check, we must support it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/deserted-streets-return-as-cops-nmc-tighten-screws/articleshow/81556463.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Veggie vendors planning to curb purchases in the wake of 1pm diktat||Nagpur: Uttam Bhalekar moves around in the lanes of Bharat Nagar, vending vegetables in his e-rickshaw during morning and evening. Bhalekar, who buys vegetables worth Rs3000-4000 from the wholesaler everyday, may not be able to recover his expenses today. Many other neighbourhood vendors like Bhalekar say they may have to throw away much of their stock as the local administration’s curbs on running shops beyond 1pm also include vegetable vendors. They need to work at least till the evening to completely sell their stock for the day, the vendors say.“The entire stock cannot be sold during the morning round itself, and a number of vegetables do not last till the next day. If I am not able to come out in the evening, much of the stock may have to be thrown away,” says Bhalekar.Vendors like him are now planning to cut down on purchases from wholesale markets to avoid any carry over. Another vendor Shankar Gupta says he would now buy just enough stock to last in the morning round. This would have a cascading effect on farmers, who are already in losses due to curbs on weekly markets and the Saturday-Sunday closure that was in force before the weeklong lockdown, say wholesalers.Traders at Kalamna say the rates of a number of vegetables have come down to half due to the curbs on weekly markets. The fresh restriction is expected to further impact the prices of the farmers’ produce.Markets like the agriculture produce marketing yard at Kalamna and Cotton Market get supplies from nearby villages and the neighbouring Chhindwara district in Madhya Pradesh. Farmers bring the produce almost on a daily basis.The president of Nagpur Sabji Market Yuva Adatiya Sangh, an association of vegetable traders at Kalamna, says rates have crashed after the government banned weekly markets. Traders pitching their shops at the weekly marts are the major buyers from the wholesalers. As they are not turning up, rates of vegetables across the board have halved, he explains.“For example, tomato is now being sold at Rs3/kg, cauliflower and other greens are fetching not more than Rs1.5-2/kg. A number of other vegetables are not getting a rate more than Rs10/kg. This is half of the earlier levels,” says Gaur.Milind Deosthale, also a trader at Kalamna, says the farmers are forced to sell the vegetables at throwaway prices at the wholesale markets. The vegetables are highly perishable and cannot be stored, so farmers have no choice but to sell at whatever rates they get, he adds.There are exceptions, like Rakesh Mathankar in Ram Nagar. “I don’t think it will have any major impact. If things are streamlined, vendors can easily clear their stock till 1pm,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/veggie-vendors-planning-to-curb-purchases-in-the-wake-of-1pm-diktat/articleshow/81556481.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Lucknow||KGMU saliva kit: Hope buoys for cancer patients||LUCKNOW: King George’s Medical University (KGMU) has got the patent from the government of India for an artificial saliva reservoir developed by one of its faculty members. Known as ‘pilot saliva reservoir’, the 1x1.5-inch device stores artificial saliva for a long time to help oral cancer patients who have lost the ability to produce saliva. Several static saliva reservoirs made of plastic are already available in the market. These, however, can store artificial saliva that lasts about 12-15 minutes. The device is used to help patients whose salivary glands are damaged during cancer treatment. Saliva glands are either removed or get damaged during radiotherapy or chemotherapy. As a result, a patient is unable to produce saliva or its production is limited. This affects a patient’s ability to consume and digest food. Besides, the mouth remains constantly dry leading to mouth ulcer. “The pilot saliva reservoir is a chip that can be fixed in the upper or lower teeth gaze in the mouth. The size can be customised as per patient’s requirement,” said Dr Lakshya Kumar, professor in prosthodontics department, who developed the device. “The chip is filled with artificial saliva and when pressed with tongue or cheek, it releases drops of artificial saliva through tiny holes measuring 0.8 mm, thereby helping patient in keeping their mouth moist and in eating and ingestion,” he said. Dr Kumar added that static saliva reservoirs made of soft plastic currently available in the market could maintain saliva flow for only 12-15 minutes because they have no mechanism to regulate flow of artificial saliva as desired by the patient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-saliva-kit-hope-buoys-for-cancer-patients/articleshow/81558974.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Nagpur||Greens find options for parking plaza||Nagpur: In strong opposition to felling of nearly 250 full-grown trees for making Ajni metro station’s parking area, environment activists have found alternative sites for the project which will ensure minimum damage to the green cover. On Wednesday, environment activists organized a spot visit to these alternative sites for the media. According to them, these sites are closer to the one chosen by MahaMetro inside the premises of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri). The first alternative site that they showed was a small patch of road opposite the metro station. “This road is used by motorists to take a left turn. However, after just 100 metres, there is another road leading to the same route. The first road can be easily utilized for parking of vehicles by building a multi-level parking,” said environment activist Anasuya Kale Chhabrani. Adding that MahaMetro has asked for nearly two acres of land from Neeri, she added, “Even if we leave some space on the left side of the road for movement of people and parking of vehicles of nearby residents, there would still be enough space left for the parking plaza.” Activists also pointed out that there was no traffic survey or feasibility study available in the public domain. “Knowing an estimate number of vehicles that would be parked on a daily basis is a must before finalizing the spot for a parking plaza. Not everybody who will use the metro will park their vehicles,” said environment activist Shrikant Deshpande. Opposite the road proposed as an alternative site are slums which according to activists are another viable option for developing a parking area. “MahaMetro can try acquiring these slums under government schemes. The dwellers should be rehabilitated and this area should be utilized. It has very less number of trees compared to the Neeri premises,” said Deshpande. Activists have also proposed a third alternative site which has allegedly been encroached by a member of a political party. The land is right behind the metro station. “We will have to find out more details regarding the ownership of the land,” said activists. As per MahaMetro officials, the agency had explored alternative sites in the area. “A lot are under litigation. We visited various locations but it didn’t work out,” they said. Officials further assured that they will try to reduce environmental damage. “We plan to transplant a large number of trees that will be felled,” they said. Activists, however, stated that transplantation done previously by the agency has failed miserably.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/greens-find-options-for-parking-plaza/articleshow/81557700.cms||Manka Behl

At least 25 patients, including 17 Covid infected, were evacuated by the locals and firemen as the fire engulfed the four-storey hospital that is located in a densely populated area. No one was injured in the incident. “We got a call at about 9pm that a fire had broken out in the hospital. The fire has been put out and the patients have been evacuated. The hospital has one ward for Covid-19 patients,” said a fire official. The firemen broke windows panes of the hospital to evacuate the patients who were shifted to another hospital. Fire officials said that the reason for the fire is yet to be ascertained. “We saw smoke billowing out of the first floor and rushed to the spot. I helped evacuate about six patients who were stuck in the building due to smoke,” said Arbaz Pathan, who stays near the hospital. Social worker, Farooq Soni, who also stays in the locality, said, “The authorities should check whether the hospital was following fire safety norms. Lives of so many patients were put in danger due to the fire.” Hospital trustee Ankit Shah said that there were 17 Covid patients on the fourth floor apart from six other patients. All patients were evacuated safely. The fire broke out in the accounts department on the first floor due to short circuit. In September last year, a fire had broken out in the ICU ward at SSG Hospital. Thirty-nine patients were evacuated from the ward but no one was injured in the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/close-shave-for-patients-in-hospital-fire/articleshow/81556490.cms||---

These buses, however, are bypassing the Kolhapur bus depot. Tensions continued in the Maharashtra-Karnataka border districts on Tuesday. In Gadhinglaj, some people, believed to be Shiv Sena workers, spray-painted the words ‘Jai Maharashtra’ on the windshield of a Karnataka bus travelling from Belagavi to Pune. Rohan Palange, the MSRTC divisional controller, said: “Some minor incidents of attack on buses of both states continue. We don’t want to put the lives of passengers at risk by resuming the service now. The Shiv Sena has decided to agitate on March 20. As a result, we need to be more cautious. Currently, the local bus service to Nipani in Karanataka has been started to avoid inconvenience to regular passengers. All buses to Belagavi remain cancelled. Karnataka has started buses along the long routes, but amid tense situations in and around Kolhapur. The buses are bypassing central bus stand in the city.” The police has advised the MSRTC not to ply the buses for now. They have informed the MSRTC that they will need the force on March 20 to avoid any untoward incidents in the border areas. The Shiv Sena has threatened to shut businesses and shops run by Kannada people in districts of south Maharashtra and had also threatened to stop Karnataka transport along the national highway. The MSRTC has also sought protection for the buses from Karnataka police. There has been no progress in this regard so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/karnataka-long-route-buses-bypass-kolhapur-city-depot/articleshow/81546160.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai:Fadnavis stayed steps ahead of home min as row grew big||Mumbai: The crisis-ridden Maha Vikas Aghadi government led by Uddhav Thackeray has found itself on the back-foot following a series of frontal attacks by leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis in the Sachin Waze controversy. In fact, after state home minister Anil Deshmukh failed to take on Fadnavis in the legislature, CM Thackeray had no option but to first transfer Waze and then shift Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh to an insignificant post. Sources said there was lack of coordination among constituents of the MVA, and the Aghadi had failed to take on Fadnavis unitedly. When Fadnavis made charges against Thackeray over Waze’s links with the Shiv Sena and his dubious business activities, neither Deshmukh nor any Shiv Sena leader stood up in the legislature to defend the CM. Deshmukh had the first opportunity to shift Waze on the Monday before last, before the start of the day’s legislative proceedings. When there was uproar in the House and it was found that Fadnavis had more information on the matter than the official briefing received by Deshmukh, the home minister had no option to announce Waze’s transfer for the smooth functioning of the legislature. A senior NCP cabinet member admitted that Deshmukh had been unable to defend the MVA government, particularly the reinstatement of Waze despite the fact that the police officer faced serious criminal cases. “Deshmukh’s homework was poor. He never anticipated the situation, following which the government had to face massive embarrassment on the floor of the House,” the cabinet member said. The NCP minister said that once the case was entrusted to the Anti-Terrorism Squad, there was no monitoring and an impression was created that since Waze was associated with the Sena, there had been no progress in the investigation. The NIA later stepped in and arrested Waze. Now it appears that the NIA may register an offence of murder and book Waze for the crime. Transport minister and Sena spokesperson Anil Parab strongly defended the government, particularly the CM, saying it was a fact that Waze had joined the Sena. “He had taken VRS from the government job and had joined the Shiv Sena. Nothing wrong in such a decision. We never supported his illegal activities. We are not even remotely associated with his anti-social and illegal activities. Now, since he has been arrested, the law will take its course,” Parab said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaifadnavis-stayed-steps-ahead-of-home-min-as-row-grew-big/articleshow/81557727.cms||---

Responding to a question raised by Congress MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy in Lok Sabha a few days ago, Naik said the ministry of defence has accorded in-principle approval and signed a memorandum of agreement on March 2, 2017, for opening of a Sainik School at Warangal district. Thereafter, there has been no response from the Telangana government till date. Referring to the reply, Uttam said it was shocking that the TRS government has ignored the setting up of a Sainik School in the state for four years after the MoD gave the approval. “It is abundantly clear from the above statement that the delay in setting up of a Sainik School in Telangana, even after seven years of formation of the state is largely due to the negligent attitude of the TRS government. As an alumni of National Defence Academy (NDA) and former military officer, I urge the state government to seriously take up the process of setting up a Sainik School in Telangana,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-response-on-sainik-school-from-t-govt-centre/articleshow/81557738.cms||Roushan Ali

NRS College run by Shivam Shanti Shiksha Prasar Samiti was given recognition by NCTE on March 3, 2016. Samiti took the recognition on the plot no-1564, village Barkonha district Chhatarpur. Prayas Samaj Kalyan Samiti also took the recognition on March 3, 2016 on the same plot no-1564, Village Barkonha district Chhatarpur. TOI has the recognition orders of both the colleges. These colleges are under the scanner for distributing degrees without proper infrastructure and teaching facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/report-on-ghost-colleges-submitted-to-higher-edu-dept/articleshow/81557710.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Computer operator issues pattadar passbooks, held||HYDERABAD: Ramagundam police arrested a computer operator working at Nennel tahsildar office in Mancherial district for illegally issuing pattadar passbooks to farmers and giving them ownership over government land without the approval of assignment review committee (ARC). Police named 10 revenue department employees, including two retired tahsildars, as accused in the case. The accused is P Naresh, computer operator. Based on a complaint of J Raja Lingam, tahsildar of Nennel, a case was registered against Naresh in 2018 under IPC sections for cheating and criminal breach of trust and for misusing the government-issued dongle to illegally assign government lands to farmers by collecting money from them. During the investigation, police verified 178 pattadar passbooks issued through Naresh and found out that 90 of them are eligible and 88 are ineligible to be the land owners, Ramagundam police commissioner V Satyanarayana said. As per the data, ownership of 208.19 acres of land in eight villages — Khammampally, Jogapur, Puppalavanipet, Mannegudem, Gollapalli, Nennel, Ghanpur and Mylaram — was illegally assigned to farmers through pattadar passbooks. Naresh worked as computer operator at Nennel tahsildar office between June 2010 and March 2018. Till March 2012, pahani, a legal land related document, used to be issued to farmers through land record management system (LRMS) and from March 2012, pattadar passbooks are being issued through the portal where Naresh used to digitally sign on the document using government-issued dongle, police said.  Police recorded the statements of all 88 ineligible farmers and the investigation is still on to ascertain the role of yet to be arrested revenue officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/computer-operator-issues-pattadar-passbooks-held/articleshow/81557711.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Outlet owners are now suggesting their customers to place orders through WhatsApp and in broadcast groups for doorstep deliveries or pick-ups to avoid crowding, and for better compliance of the restrictive norms. Vishal Kinkar, an experienced manager at a mega mart retail shop in Sakkardara Chowk, observed that the panic buying of groceries and other essentials had already taken place by March 14, after which the milder weekend restrictions were replaced by stricter, extended ones.It was not surprising for him that his outlet remained largely empty, even when the time limit of 1pm was being enforced. “We are delivering essential daily need items online, rotating staffers to maintain Covid distancing and also taking other precautionary measures,” he said. “We have broadcast groups where the orders are placed and the items are delivered at home,” Kinkar added.Lalit Jumani, whose family owns a popular grocery shop at Mahal, said many of his customers were placing orders through WhatsApp. “We are keeping the orders packed and ready for the customers to pick up and leave immediately,” he said. “Even if the customers arrive at the last moment before closing the shop, they would not return empty-handed as their materials would be ready to be taken away,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/grocers-receiving-orders-on-whatsapp-broadcast-groups/articleshow/81556492.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Search for Walker leads to discovery of Walker-II||Nagpur: In the search for Tipeshwar tiger T1-C1 aka Walker, which deserted Dnyanganga wildlife sanctuary in Buldhana one-and-a-half months ago, the forest officials stumbled upon another Walker, T3-C1 male tiger from Pandharkawda territorial division. This is after 80 years that a tiger has been spotted in Gautala Autramghat sanctuary, 70km from Aurangabad.Sunil Limaye, APCCF (wildlife) for the west region, said the last time tigers were spotted in Gautala Autramghat was in the 1940s. The latest tiger was recorded in camera traps on March 15, 2021. The sanctuary lies in the Satmala and Ajanta hill ranges of the Western Ghats, and administratively is in Aurangabad and Jalgaon districts.“What is more astonishing is that during the animal’s entire travel from Pandharkawda to Gautala, it was not seen by anyone and there was not a single case of conflict with humans nor any cattle kills. The tiger must have crossed several hurdles like agriculture fields, canals, rivers, highways, and villages,” said Limaye.Limaye added, “Prior to the tiger being captured on camera traps, the staff led by DFO Vijay Satpute saw indirect evidence like pugmarks and scat during foot patrolling on March 11-12, in the sanctuary. This was something new for them and hence camera traps were installed and history has been created.” Earlier, on February 27, 2021, TOI had reported that T1-C1 (Walker) had left Dyanganga sanctuary by January-end after staying in the park for a year. PCCF (wildlife) NH Kakodkar had asked forest officials to launch a search for Walker.Wildlife divisions under Melghat Tiger Reserve in Akola and Buldhana had launched a search and were in touch with Aurangabad officials too. “During his visit to Dnyanganga, Walker had reached the foothills of Ajanta and Ellora caves and hence last week we requested Gautala officials to look for the tiger,” said APCCF & Melghat field director MS Reddy.Walker had dispersed from Tipeshwar sanctuary in Pandharkawda on June 21, 2019, in search of a mate and territory and had reached Dnyanganga on November 29, 2019, logging 3,020km travelling through eight districts.“It seems the tiger must have followed Walker’s trail to reach Gautala Autramghat and traveled roughly 2,100km. Walker was radio-collared and this led to close monitoring , and hence we could know about the corridor and animal movement,” says Wildlife Institute of India (WII) scientist Bilal Habib.Habib adds, “The male cub was not collared but its dispersal shows Tipeshwar-Painganga-Dyanganga-Katepurna-Gautala is a viable corridor and there is a need to conduct a study and further strengthen it.”APCCF Limaye said, “Initially we thought T3-C1 was Walker, but after matching its stripe pattern it turned out to be a cub from the first litter of T3 female that was first photographed on a kill on April 17, 2018, in Pandharkawda division. Tipeshwar sanctuary is one of the biggest sources of flourishing tiger population outside the park in territorial areas. The newly spotted tiger must be around 3 years old.”Satpute said, “Though there are around 20-25 leopards in Gautala Autramghat (260sqkm) and prey base in the form of ungulates like nilgai, wild boar, chinkara, and blackbucks, presence of tiger has thrilled the staff. We have formed seven teams to monitor the tiger. It is fire season and all precautions will be taken to protect the tiger.”“As per the All India Tiger Estimation (AITE)-2018, there are 312 tigers in Maharashtra. Even as numbers have increased, tigers are concentrated in certain pockets only. Such dispersals are a good sign. It is high time habitat management works and prey base is improved in these areas to hold on increasing population of big cats,” said Vishal Bansod, former honorary wildlife warden, Amravati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/search-for-walker-leads-to-discovery-of-walker-ii/articleshow/81556506.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Suryapet SP Bhaskaran told TOI that MP Bandi Sanjay attended two meetings organised by party workers at Huzurnagar and Kodad on Wednesday and while he was returning to Hyderabad, about 30 to 40 people associated with MRPS and Swaeroes, blocked the road at Kodad. “They have ideological differences with the BJP leader and stopped the convoy. Our people dispersed the protesters and with police escort, the MP’s vehicle was sent to Hyderabad via Huzurnagar and Miryalaguda. There was no assault or damage to property,” the SP said. However, subsequently on social media some people have started circulating messages saying that vehicles of BJP workers were damaged by the protesters in Kodad. “Some people started spreading rumours through social media saying vehicle of BJP’s district leader Bhagya Reddy was damaged.

---||Nagpur||1st paper in Mar 2020, 2nd in Feb 2021, 3rd to be held today||Nagpur: Come Thursday, when BEd first semester students appear for their third paper, it would be over a year since their offline examinations commenced. Their first paper was held in March last year and then due to Covid-19 outbreak, their exam was rescheduled to February 22 this year. After they appeared in their second paper, the second wave of deadly virus struck the region and again their remaining third and fourth papers were deferred. It was only after their plight was highlighted by the media, including TOI, that NU agreed to conduct their exams on March 18 and 20. However, due to Covid-19 induced second lockdown from March 15, their remaining papers were in doubt. The NU authorities then persuaded the civic officials and police to allow these students to appear for their exams, which had been held up from last one year. The students said they were admitted for a two-year course in July 2019, and would have graduated by this July. However, their first semester exam scheduled in October-November was deferred citing the Maharashtra assembly polls by the NU administration. After their first paper in March last year, their exam was indefinitely postponed due to Covid-19 induced lockdown. When NU conducted summer-2020 exams in October-November in online format, it was also decided to conduct their offline papers. However, most of the examinees hailing from various places in the state requested NU to postpone it, as it wouldn’t have been possible for them to reach Nagpur due to travel restrictions. Even the hostels were closed that time. The NU Examination Section officials told them that since they appeared in offline mode in the first paper, it wouldn’t be possible to change the format now. Subsequently, their exams couldn’t be held at that time. When the Covid-19 situation normalized, NU decided to conduct their remaining papers from February 22. After their third paper, many officials at the exam centre of Dr Ambedkar College at Deekshabhoomi tested positive, which again led to cancellation of their exams. Though Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable had made alternate arrangements for them at Dhanwate National College (DNC) for remaining papers, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) administration warned NU against conducting exams amid rising number of cases. “At the time we should be searching for jobs, we’re still appearing in our first semester exams. Due to NU’s negligence, we’re suffering and our two years have been wasted. Had they taken exams in December 2019, we would have been in our third semester. Due to this inordinate delay, we’re facing problems in appearing for Teachers Eligibility Test (TET) and jobs,” the aggrieved students told TOI, hoping that their remaining papers wouldn’t get affected.

---||Lucknow||Lacking awareness, low income group missing out on jabs||Lucknow: Senior citizens have shown exemplary enthusiasm in taking jabs against Covid-19 in the ongoing mass vaccination drive, but a TOI survey in three slums and a colony for economically weaker in the city has found that the participation of this section is comparatively lower because of lack of awareness, education and means. A visit to four slums — Purania and Vinayakpuram in Vikasnagar; Baba ka Purva in Nishatganj; near City Station and a residential colony for economically weaker section in Balaganj — revealed that most among elderly and those aged 45-59 with comorbidities have not taken the jabs as they don’t know what paperwork or procedure is required for it. Further, many people in these areas neither have access to mass media and smartphones, nor are aware what comorbidity means. A few were aware about vaccination, but said they couldn’t take out time from their daily work for vaccination. Some elderly said they were too weak to walk and don’t have anyone in the house to take them to centres. Ram Kumar (70), who runs a chat shop in Purunia, said, “I heard about vaccination from customers, but cannot take time out for it. Loss of a day’s work means no food for the family that day.” Chandni (46) of Balaganj, who has kidney issues, said, “I have heard the word comorbidity for the first time. It will be great if authorities send somebody here to make people aware about the eligibility and procedure for vaccination.” A comparison showed that of over 40,800 elderly citizens vaccinated so far in the city, 70% got jabs at centres at big government hospitals or private hospitals. Health officials admit that turnout among lower income groups has not been encouraging in comparison to others, but added that steps are being taken to help them get the vaccine. Vaccination nodal officer and medical superintendent, Balrampur Hospital, Dr Himanshu Chaturvedi, said, “We don’t ask beneficiaries about their financial status, but have observed that the turnout of people who appear to be from lower income groups is less. For this, we are asking our staff to help such people.” Chief medical superintendent, Silver Jubilee CHC and vaccination nodal officer at KGMU, Dr Priyanka Yadav, “We have noticed that participation of slum dwellers is low, but soon it will increase because we are launching an awareness drive.” Chief medical officer, Lucknow, Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar said, “We have asked ASHA and Anganwadi workers to mobilise beneficiaries in slum and BPL areas. We have also converted many PHCs and CHCs into vaccination centres.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lacking-awareness-low-income-group-missing-out-on-jabs/articleshow/81558985.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Three of these incidents occurred on March 12, while another theft was reported on March 16. The rural police are on the lookout for two men who are suspected to be behind the robberies.Four offences have been registered with three police stations, including two with Bhor police, and one each with Rajgad and Saswad police stations. The theft took place at three temples at Pisavare, Ambade, and Savardare villages in Bhor taluka and at Ketkavle in Purandar taluka, police said.Dhananjay Patil, deputy superintendent of police (Bhor division) told TOI, “The in-charges of four police stations in Bhor division visited all the temples in their jurisdictions and made an appeal for installing CCTV cameras and appointing volunteers at the temples during the day as well as in the night.”Dadasaheb Gurav, priest of Bhairavnath temple at Savardare village, told TOI that around 6pm on March 12, when he went to the temple for ‘aarti’, he noticed the lock on the door of sanctum sanctorum missing. “I found two masks, worth Rs70,000, missing, too,” Gurav said. “One of villagers told us that on March 12, two unknown men took shelter at the temple,” he said. Suraj Bathe, a priest from the temple in Ketkavle, said, “Four silver masks, worth Rs1lakh, were stolen from the temple on March 12.” On the same day, four masks, worth Rs1.3 lakh, were stolen from a temple at Pisavare village in Bhor taluka. The suspects again struck at Ambade village in Bhor taluka early on Tuesday (March 16) and made off with ornaments worth Rs6.3lakh. Patil said, “Prima facie probe revealed involvement of two men in four thefts. All the temples are situated in the middle of the village. Despite that the thefts occurred, and no one noticed. We have appealed to people to exercise extra caution,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ornaments-worth-rs-9-3l-stolen-from-four-temples-in-rural-pune/articleshow/81556550.cms||Mihir Tanksale

Accordingly, the civic body has increased the fine amount for shops and other commercial establishments to Rs 1,000 if physical distancing norms are not followed, hands of the customers are not sanitised or the staff does not wear the face masks. For marriage halls, the fine amount has been increased to Rs 2,000 if more that 50 people are found attending the event. In addition to this, the establishments will also be shut down for two hours as a penalty — but only for second time offenders. Civic administrator Kadambari Balkawade said, “We have found that Covid rules are being violated in shops, commercial establishments and even marriage halls repeatedly. For third and fourth violations, the establishments will be shut down for 15 days and one month, respectively. The licence to run the establishment will be cancelled too. Rraders and operators must ensure that no one is allowed in if they are not wearing a face mask.” Balkawade said the decision to impose strict action has been taken after it was found that the establishments are turning out to be the centres of Covid spread. “Entire families have tested positive and in no time the infection may spread locally. Often, people who have travelled from outside are found to be infected. Many a times, such people do not reveal their contacts — which is deterimental to the local residents. We expect the contacts are traced fast so that a further spread is checked,” said Balkawade. Over 200 civic employees from various departments are involved in penalising the establishments and even individuals for violating the Covid rules. For individuals, the fine amount for not wearing mask is Rs 100.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/kmc-doubles-fine-amount-for-errant-shops-marriage-halls/articleshow/81546245.cms||---

Durga Prasad Timsina, alias Dipak Joshi/Jaisi, has been lodged in various jails for 41 years. A school teacher in eastern Nepal’s Lumbak village, Durga Prasad, during a visit to Darjeeling, four decades ago, got embroiled in a murder case. According to the case history, Durga Prasad had come to Darjeeling after being promised a job in the Indian Army.  The person who had made the promise allegedly made him commit a murder. The Sessions Case No. 31 of 1981 in the First Additional District & Sessions Judges, Darjeeling, is yet to be decided. Another prisoner, who had been lodged in the Dum Dum central jail, told his friends about Durga Prasad. Word reached HAM radio operators in Kolkata, who then contacted Nepal Radio Club, whose members launched a search and finally located his mother Manomaya Devi in Lumbak village of east Nepal. Thereafter, she contacted the Nepal consulate and pleaded that she be reunited with her son. Learning about Durga Prasad’s predicament, West Bengal State Legal Services Authority got his mental health condition professionally evaluated. The latter assessed that Durga Prasad’s IQ level was on a par with that of a 10-year-old, following which a conclusion was drawn that he was unfit to stand trial. The division bench of Chief Justice Thottathil B Radhakrishnan and Justice Aniruddha Roy on Wednesday asked Durga Prasad be handed over to his relative Prakash Chandra Sharma Timsina and facilitate his return with the help of Nepal consulate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nepal-man-gets-bail-after-41-yrs/articleshow/81556586.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Pune||PCB seeks Rs 5 crore for repair, restoration of Shivaji Market||PUNE: The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) has written to the district collector seeking Rs 5 crore for the repair and restoration of a portion of Shivaji Market, which suffered extensive damage due to a huge fire that broke out on Tuesday. The board has cited paucity of funds on account of non-release of its share of GST and other reasons while seeking the release of funds as a special case under the Disaster Management Relief Fund. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh told TOI on Wednesday, “The disaster management fund has never been allocated or used for such purposes, but we will verify the PCB’s request before taking a final call.” The PCB authorities said they would also seek funds from the Ministry of Defence for undertaking the restoration work in the market. On Wednesday, officials from the PCB’s civil and electrical departments inspected the fire site again to estimate the loss of property. “A fire and structural audit of the market is being conducted jointly by our fire brigade department and engineering sections. It will take a few days to complete the exercise and prepare a report,” Vijay Chavan, head of electrical department, said. Work on clearance of the debris was going on at the site on Wednesday. Only the fish market was closed while the other sections, some chicken shops and vegetables shops were functioning, an official said. “Loss of property will be calculated with the help of a private heritage architect who had previously worked on other structures,” an official from the PCB’s engineering section said. A private architect had calculated the heritage value of the market at close to Rs4 crore in 2008-09. Based on this valuation, the cantonment has sought funds from the district administration, he added. Manjoor Shaikh, president of Shivaji Market Vendors’ Association, said, “The authorities should release funds for the restoration work. Fish vendors have faced huge financial loss. The cantonment should carry out the work at the earliest to restart the fish market here.” Priyanka Shirigiri, former vice president of the PCB, said, “We will pursue this matter with the state and central government. The market should also get listed as a heritage structure so that it will get special funds regularly for maintenance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcb-seeks-rs-5cr-for-repair-restoration-of-shivaji-mkt/articleshow/81556561.cms||Sandip Dighe

The employees front of PSPCL and Democratic Mulazam Front (DMF) comprising employees from various state government departments have assured to send 500 persons each whereas the arhtiyas (commission agents) too have assured to send sufficient number of persons into the protests. The employees of PSPCL and DMF will stay for five days at a stretch and will send the next jatha after five days, said SKM on Wednesday evening. They soon will start sending jathas as wheat harvesting is expected to start from the first week of April. SKM leader Darshan Pal said apart from sending a jatha, the electricity department workers’ union had promised to send 50 members of technical staff, including linemen and assistant linemen, to set the electricity system right at morcha sites on Delhi borders. He said they had also promised to bring cables to systemise the power network to make protesters face the heat as long durable cables will be laid which could resist the load of air conditioners. He said as SKM was supporting the arhtiyas against the latest directives of FCI about asking farmers to upload their land records to get direct payment, the arhtiyas have assured the morcha to send a large number of persons to support the protest. They may start sending persons soon and may discontinue only during wheat procurement season. “The kisan morcha has given a call to farmers not to cooperate with the FCI by not uploading land records as by doing so they may have to face a lot of hardships, as the central government has only one-point agenda: of harassing Punjab farmers for intensifying the struggle against the central government.”he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/employee-unions-to-support-protest/articleshow/81557807.cms||Neel Kamal

---||Amritsar||Movement of ’40s in focus in Mansa||BATHINDA: With farmers holding their ground against the Centre over its three contentious farm laws, their struggle has found a parallel in the movement of Muzaras (tenant farmers or sharecroppers) of the 1930s-40s when they had fought against biswedaris (big landlords) and succeeded in enactment of the PEPSU Occupancy Tenants Act in 1953, allowing tenants to become owners of their land while abolishing the biswedari system. The Muzara movement which started in 1930s when pro-freedom organisation Riyasti Praja Mandal had taken shape and continued even after gaining independence till 1949. The violent police and army action at Kishangarh village in Mansa on March 19, 1949 wherein 4 muzaras (tenant farmers) were killed proved as a turning point for ending of the tenancy system. Following the incidents of 1949, Kishangarh had become a beacon of farmers’ resistance and fight against feudalism and monarchy. The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has decided to observe the day of March 19 in a big way in remembrance of the big fight of peasants against the powers, saying that the farmers are again through a similar fight. The biswedaris had taken control of lands, reducing small original owners to tenants and the Muzaras had to pay batai (share crop) to biswedaris after tilling the land. The batai at times used to be up to half of the total crop. Painted in red and white with symbols of left organisations, a gate at the entrance of the village is a reminder of the sacrifices of peasants for the rights of lands, said Hardev Singh Arshi, a former MLA and senior leader of Communist Party of India (CPI) who had closely looked into Muzara movement. After the formation of Riyasti Praja Mandal in 1927, its president Sewa Singh Thikriwala had started organizing tenants in several villages asking them to stop paying batai. Praja Mandal members Bhagwan Singh Longowalia and Jagir Singh Joga started supporting and leading the resistance. The Muzara movement started in 1930 when tenants in some villages started refusing to pay batai to the landlords. Violent incidents happened in many villages when tenants declined to pay batai, said Arshi and senior left leader Kulwant Singh Kishangarh. In 1936, the All India Kisan Sabha was formed and Praja Mandal leaders got associated with it. Then in 1948 communist leader Teja Singh Sutantar formed Red Party, which got the support of kisan sabha and praja mandal. Red Party demanded land ownership rights to tilling peasants. During this period, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU) comprising eight princely states was formed, but the condition of peasants remained same. Freedom fighters and communist leaders Teja Singh Sutantar, Dharm Singh Fakkar, Jangir Singh Joga, Chajju Mal played a big role in the movement. “We take big inspiration from that historic struggle of tenant peasants for gaining ownership rights. Taking cue from it, we are fighting to keep control of the lands which are being eyed by the corporates,” said BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/movement-of-40s-in-focus-in-mansa/articleshow/81557811.cms||Neel Kamal

Sharma and author-journalist Jane Borges discussed regression therapy and Sharma’s latest book ‘Metaphors of Memory’ at the spring edition of Metaphor The Lucknow Lit Fest. Sharma talked about the mysteries of mind and how the past and present life influences our current behaviour and medical conditions. Regression therapy is a treatment that focusses on a person’s past life or significant past events that have been interfering with physical or mental health. “In acute conditions, nothing can replace allopathic medicines. Similar is the case when it comes to surgeries and acute infections like dengue and malaria, which can be treated with medication. But when it comes to patients suffering from chronic conditions like depression, insomnia or arthritis that have no cure in allopathy, regression therapy can give better results,” said Sharma. Sharma said the therapy is different from hypnotism and explores the subconscious mind to find the link between a person’s present life and past. “Be it physical, emotional or mental issues, releasing memories and negative energies associated with our past life can help us understand the root cause of a problem. The healing and recovery rate is always high when the patient is equally cooperative in the therapy,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/doc-springs-hope-says-regression-therapy-can-cure-patients-with-chronic-ailments/articleshow/81559005.cms||Aditi Singh

The assessment is still being done,” NITI Aayog member- health Dr V K Paul said. tnn He said the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said as a precaution, investigation should go on and has categorically said not to suspend the vaccination. "India's own committee that looks at adverse effects is seized of this issue. For the last few days, it is tracking the information that is available to us in a very systematic manner and again I assure you that we have no signal of concern in this regard," Paul added. Emphasising that the vaccination programme with Covishield will go on with full vigour in the country, Paul said: "We are mindful of the fact to address this concern, based on the emerging situation. As of today, there is no concern at all with regard to Covishield," Paul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-no-concerns-over-covishield-yet-drive-to-continue/articleshow/81560500.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Costly fuel, demand-supply gap push protein prices up||Kolkata: People in election-bound Bengal are spending more to strike a protein balance in their menu as chicken and mutton prices have spiked again while supply of fish has become erratic. The prices are unlikely to drop before Dol and Holi. A high fuel price, spiralling cost of chicken feed, erratic supply chain and a bird-flu scare have created a demand-supply gap, pushing prices up. The retail price of dressed chicken rose to Rs 250-Rs 260 a kg on Wednesday while the price of mutton price hovered around Rs 750-Rs 800 a kg. Supply of fish has been scanty due to sudden rising temperatures and higher fuel prices. Price of chicken, the cheapest source of protein, has been fluctuating the most frequently. This is the second time in a month that it rose to the Rs 250-Rs 260 range.  “The price rise is mainly due to the very steep spike in chicken feed price. Globally, corn farming was badly hit due to Covid and now, India has exported a huge amount of the crop, causing a deficit at the domestic level. Since corn and mustard are principal ingredients of poultry feed, cost of manufacturing poultry feed rose by 50%, spiking cost of rearing chicken manifold,” said Madan Maity, secretary of West Bengal Poultry Federation. Another reason is the exit of several small poultry farms from the trade. The bird-flu scare and resultant distress sale also led to a yawning gap between demand and supply. “The fluctuating retail prices of chicken and rumours have discouraged small farmers from rearing chicken. The higher cost of transportation has also been discouraging many. So the supply chain has suffered,” said Satyajit Sinha Roy, a retailer at Lake Market. “Since the production cost of chicken is higher, many poultry farmers have lost interest in making minimum investment in the farms,” said Nimai Das, a poultry farm owner. Prices of mutton and fish have also increased steadily. Mutton price dropped to Rs 650 a kg only six months ago, but costlier diesel has made transportation expensive. It is now selling at Rs 750 a kg at most outlets while some big brand shops are selling mutton at Rs 800 a kg. Price of fish and its availability became an issue at retail markets across the city because of the hike in fuel price. Fish price has risen by Rs 100 a kg. This is why there is a slump in demand of ‘chalani fish’ (fish brought from other states) and this trend is likely to increase with the onset of summer heat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/costly-fuel-demand-supply-gap-push-protein-prices-up/articleshow/81556596.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

He celebrated his birthday with farmers at Singhu border. Khan, who retired from the Indian Army after 23 years of service in 2016, reached the borders of Delhi on November 26, 2020, but did not go home even when his nephew solemnised his marriage on January 21. Khan is associated with Krantikari Kisan Union, which is headed by Darshan Pal. After his retirement from Armoured Corps in 18 Cavalry, Khan had been working as a caretaker in a hostel at Thapar University. He says his daughter, 21, and son, 19, are taking care of his wife and the family back home. “I have no agricultural land and belong to a Muslim family, but that does not stop me from supporting my farmer brothers,” he says. “When the central government enacted farm laws and farmers left for Delhi on November 26, I felt the injustice that had been meted out to them. I accompanied them with a water tanker and ration on a trolley. Since then, I have been at the border and making any arrangements, be it boarding and lodging, preparing flags, arranging water or anything for those turning up into protests,” says Khan, who many a times even sports the turban. “Let the government repeal the laws and we will return homes, but till then we will stay put here,” he says. Sanyukta Kisan Morcha leader Darshan Pal described Khan as an asset. “He has been supporting farmers from the start,” Pal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/retd-soldier-doesnt-farm-but-on-protest/articleshow/81557817.cms||Neel Kamal

Women from various districts of Haryana will participate. Punjabi actress Sonia Mann and the agitation’s women faces such as Sudesh Goyat and Santosh Dahiya will address the mahila kisan panchayat. The women of Kandela and nearby villages are in preparation for the past few days. Kandela’s Sudesh Devi, a key organiser of the panchayat, said: “The khap chabutra is where men have earlier planned big agitations. For the first time, women will hold their panchayat there. Many women activists of Haryana and Punjabi singers are invited to the event.” For decades, Kandela is the state capital of farmers’ movements. Rakesh Tikait of the BKU organised the first mahapanch- ayat at the village on February 3 to set off a chain of similar national-level events. From going to the Delhi and toll plaza protests, preparing and serving langar at the sites, tending to the fields in the absence of men camped there, and sending aid to them from the village-level collections, the women of Jind district or the Bangar belt have worked a lot during the agitation. They have cordoned the BJP-JJP leaders, taken out tractors parades, and observed mahila kisan diwas in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mahila-kisan-panchayat-at-kandela-today/articleshow/81557822.cms||VIJENDER KUMAR
---||Kolkata||A year after first case, Kolkata sees no death but numbers start rising again||KOLKATA: Exactly a year after the city recorded its first Covid-19 positive case on March 17 last year, Kolkata saw no deaths but 96 new cases on Wednesday. Across the state, the number of fresh cases touched the 300-mark on Wednesday, with 303 being reported on the day. The last time Bengal had daily cases in the 300s was on January 30 (310 cases). Since then, there has been a gradual dip till about two weeks ago when the numbers started spiralling again. There is a growing concern among healthcare professionals about this sudden spurt in fresh cases. They fear a second wave unless preventive measures are taken right away. “There is a resurgence of the virus in states like Kerala and Maharashtra, from where the pandemic had started in the country before it travelled to the eastern parts. With travels opened and mixing of people from one zone to another, ignoring preventive protocol can bring a second wave in about a month or two,” said Anirban Dalui, a public health specialist at Swasthya Bhawan. An 18-year-old youth who flew back home in Kolkata from Oxford on March 15 last year was the first Covid positive patient in Kolkata.  He had tested positive two days later at the state-run Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata Hospital.  The second and the third cases followed soon, with a 22-year-old and a 23-year-old testing positive.  While all three had returned from the UK, people who had no travel history started getting the infection subsequently. The city recorded its first Covid death on March 23 when a 57-year-old from Dum Dum died at a private hospital in Salt Lake. The deceased had no travel history. By March-end, the city had recorded three deaths and 27 positive cases. The positive cases kept multiplying over the next few months with a surge from mid-July onwards. Though figures never touched the kind of soar cities like Mumbai and Delhi saw, Kolkata was struck by a massive spike in October after the Durga Puja. The highest single-day spike in the city was recorded on October 31, when Kolkata reported 931 cases while that of Bengal was 4,157 on October 22. But the fear of further explosion in numbers started receding gradually from mid-November. After a sustained decline, the number of fresh cases in the city had slid to as low as 33 on February 8 this year, when the state reported only 119 cases. But the recent spike has become a cause of concern for health officials. “Whether we go into a second wave or not would depend on several factors, including the number of asymptomatically infected who never got tested, speed of vaccination and environmental factors. But we can prevent things from going from bad to worse by not letting our guards down. Adhering to masks and other appropriate behaviour can save us from a fresh spurt,” said Prabhas Prasun Giri, associate professor at the Institute of Child Health. But with elections around the corner and mass gatherings happening frequently, another surge could be difficult to prevent, health experts feared. “Though there is a rising trend, we will not be pressing the panic button. But we are definitely alert and are working on how to contain and stop the numbers from multiplying,” said a senior health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-year-after-first-case-kolkata-sees-no-death-but-numbers-start-rising-again/articleshow/81556597.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Mumbai||Mumbai univ’s PG language enrolments up in pandemic||Mumbai: While the pandemic has taken a toll on students’ pursuit of higher education and severely impacted some post-graduate departments at Mumbai University, enrolment in language courses is still going steady. Some of the departments, in fact, have seen a rise in enrolment numbers compared with the previous years in their masters programmes. The university’s German department went online in July last year after rigorous preparation to offer an interactive learning experience. This opportunity for affordable quality education was availed by students not only in India but even Germany, Texas in the US and Dubai. “While these have been challenging times, we looked at the pandemic as an opportunity. We cannot and should not be measured merely by our student numbers, which in fact have increased for not only full-time, but part-time programmes as well,” said department head Vibha Surana. This year, when admissions opened, the Pali department received applications from Sri Lanka and Myanmar too. With uncertainty caused by the pandemic, though, especially surrounding mobility, only students from Mumbai were picked. Yet, despite an intake permit of 60, the department admitted 67 and permission has been sought to up the seats. “The MA programme has courses on meditation and field visits to Buddhist sites too. So, physical presence of students is essential,” said a university officer. The focus on the use of Hindi language in government and semi-government offices has helped push the enrolment numbers for MA programmes, said department head Karunashankar Upadhyay. Enrolment in MA (Part-1 and 2) has gone up from 80 last year to 93 now. “The numbers would have been higher if not for technical hiccups with the admission portal. Some students chose distance education as lectures were delivered online this year,” he said. “Student enrolment numbers have been falling and this year they have crashed across departments. We need to wake up to the fact that the quality of teaching is nowhere close to what it should be. But the story is different for language schools. With very few resources, they are doing very well,” asked Neeraj Hatekar, former head of Mumbai School of Economics and Public Policy. The Urdu department is a case in point. The department has the highest number of students enrolled in the PG course but is managed by only one full-time faculty. Of the 83 sanctioned positions across 14 language departments, 60% are lying vacant. Three departments do not have any permanent faculty. Senate member Sudhakar Tamboli said, “Some departments have one or two students. Why are they not offering courses that matter? These departments need to aggressively promote their courses.” Another senate member said, “There is disproportionate budget allocation too. Schools that are not doing well are getting funds on par with others like language departments that are doing better.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-univs-pg-language-enrolments-up-in-pandemic/articleshow/81557142.cms||Yogita Rao

---||Kolkata||From deaths to jabs, life has come a full circle for hosps||Kolkata: A team of doctors at AMRI Hospital was the first to come across the first Covid-19 death in Bengal when a 57-year-old Dum Dum resident died on March 22 last year. The second and the third death followed soon when two women died on two consecutive days — March 30 and 31. While one died in a government hospital in north Bengal, the other passed away in a Howrah hospital. This was the beginning of the pandemic in the state when every patient coming to the hospital could be carrying the virus. Doctors at AMRI had to intubate the first few patients without wearing PPE, risking their own lives. “It was always behind my mind that I had three vulnerable family members. Most facets of the virus was still unknown,” critical care physician Sankha Shubhra Chaudhury, a member of AMRI Salt Lake's Covid critical care team. The last one year’s life for the team of doctors touched full circle when they finally received the Covid vaccine jab. “I am very happy. I am lucky to be working with this wonderful team,” Chaudhury said. Dr Susrut Bandyopadhaya, head of the AMRI critical care unit, said that though no Covid patient is admitted at present, they have kept five beds in reserve. “When we started getting serious patients and encountered the first death, we knew that the battle would be a long one. We also knew that there would be none called non-Covid patients in the next few months. We got geared up for the battle,” said critical care specialist Rimita Dey, who was then with Peerless Hospital’s Covid team. With the number of severely infected patients multiplying, the state government started acquiring more ventilators. Equipment like ECMO and high nasal oxygen cannula came into the scene in most hospitals. “Even as we could send the first two patients on ECMO home, we lost three patients consecutively. We did not let it deter us and learnt on using ECMO more effectively on the Covid-19 infected, and today the recovery rate is close to 50%, which is comparable to any other hospitals across the globe,” said Arpan Chakraborty, ECMO specialist at Medica Superspecialty Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/from-deaths-to-jabs-life-has-come-a-full-circle-for-hosps/articleshow/81556600.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Parambir Singh led encounter cops’ team in 1990s, defended move to reinstate Sachin Waze||MUMBAI: IPS officer of the 1988 batch Parambir Singh was transferred as DG , home guards, on Wednesday in the wake of L’affaire Sachin Waze, but this is not the first time that Singh has been at the centre of controversy in his career. As additional director general of police (law and order), Singh had along with Pune police officials addressed a press meet in 2018 on the arrest of activists with alleged Maoist links. Singh had read out letters allegedly written by the activists at a media briefing when Devendra Fadnavis was CM in the then BJP-Sena government. The Maha Vikas Aghadi government has challenged this police investigation, but the MVA regime supported him when the Centre last year pulled him up in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. Singh did not give up the suicide theory, which later the Central agencies endorsed.  In 2010, Singh had come under the scanner of the state CID for allegedly framing the co-owner of Provogue Salil Chaturvedi in a drug case. Singh was additional commissioner , ATS, in 2008 when the ATS arrested Malegaon blast suspects Pragya Singh Thakur and Lt Col Prasad Purohit. During the 26/11 attacks, Singh had chased Ajmal Kasab and Ismail Dera Khan who had escaped in a police jeep after killing then ATS chief Hemant Karkare, additional CP Ashok Kamte and inspector Vijay Salaskar. Singh had identified Salaskar’s bodyguard Arun Jadhav who had received bullet injuries and rushed him to hospital. Singh took over as police commissioner on February 29 last year. In July , he shuffled around 10 DCP-rank officers and the next day, the state put the transfers on hold. When the mother of Khwaja Yunus challenged Waze’s reinstatement last year though the trial in her son’s murder case, in which Waze and 3 others are accused, was pending, Singh filed an affidavit stating he had taken the decision in the wake of large-scale Covid infections among police personnel. In October last year, Singh held a press conference stating that the police had unearthed the television rating points (TRP) manipulation scam. Singh, who was DCP in the city in the 1990s, led crime branch teams that carried out several encounters. Singh had in his team of encounter specialists the late Vijay Salaskar, Praful Bhosle, Pradeep Sharma, Waze and Hemant Desai, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiparambir-singh-led-encounter-cops-team-in-1990s-defended-move-to-reinstate-waze/articleshow/81557826.cms||Ahmed Ali

Cops later seized around 11 live country-made bombs from the area around 10.30pm. A huge police force, including DC (ESD) Ajoy Prasad, visited the spot to defuse tension. While Trinamool leaders raised fingers at goons backed by BJP, local office bearers of the latter denied any role in the incident, stating Trinamool was trying to hoard bombs in their offices. Cops said they have received a complaint and are looking into the circumstances of the case. “Prima facie, there are gaps in what both parties are claiming. We are investigating all angles and will submit a report soon,” said an officer. The face-off was defused after local mediation. BJP claimed its workers were stopped from canvassing and slapped. Trinamool claimed BJP supporters returned on a bike and lobbed two bombs at workers talking amongst themselves at the spot. Police are checking CCTV footage to ascertain the claims. Meanwhile, Rs 10 lakh was seized during special checks at a ferry ghat in Howrah. Amit Saha, a businessman from Birbhum’s Rampurhat, claimed he was carrying the cash while travelling for business purposes.

The local crime branch (LCB) sleuths caught the shooters Hardik Thakkar, Dilip Thakkar and Jayant Gadhvi, who had allegedly killed Joshi outside his office in full public view on April 28, 2018. After killing Joshi, the three had moved around nearly 26 states and visited foreign countries too. Hardik had stabbed Joshi while Dilip and Jayant were waiting with a bike nearby to escape. According to police, Ranpariya had paid them Rs 2 crore for executing the murder. According to police, they first fled to Rajasthan, thereafter to Uttar Pradesh and later reached India-Nepal border on motorcycles where they entered that country, abandoning the bike at the UP border. From Nepal they even went to Bhutan. Deepan Bhadran, superintendent of police, Jamnagar, said, “They came back to India after a few months moving around religious places as tourists. They stayed in small hotels which skip the mandatory identity cards of tourists. Jayesh was sending them Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh per month.” Dilip and Hardik were lodged in Sabarmati Central Jail in a murder case and they met Jayesh there. They both jumped parole in 2017. While on the run, Jayesh helped them make bogus passports from Nashik with false identity, showing them as residents of Maharashtra. They went to Thailand and then to Dakar in Senegal. When they reached Dakar, lockdown was announced and they got stuck there. When the lockdown relaxed and international flights resumed, Dilip came to Kolkata early this year and before the two others also reached there a few days ago. Bhadran had received specific information about their presence in Kolkata and sent a team to nab them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/jamnagar-gangster-caught-in-london/articleshow/81555343.cms||---

For others, he was a high-ranking police officer with an official car and a beacon. Sourabh Thakur (35) was arrested by Ghatkopar police on Tuesday for stealing ornaments from a woman he had been dating for several months. Investigators said they are figuring out his actual educational qualifications and occupation. The 32-year-old woman who lodged a complaint against Thakur is an IT professional. She saw his profile on a dating app last year and after their profiles matched, they started chatting. They hit it off and went out on dates. “Once, he told the woman that he wanted to meet her parents. She invited him to her apartment at Ghatkopar. When they were indoors, Thakur suddenly recollected that he had left some gifts in his car parked downstairs. He sent the woman to his car to collect them,” said zonal deputy commissioner Prashant Kadam. Four days later, the woman could not find her mother’s ancestral jewellery at home. She gradually realised that the gold ornaments had been stolen. No visitor other than Thakur had been to the apartment. She complained to Ghatkopar police after her fears were confirmed. During preliminary inquiries, police discovered the ornaments worth Rs 6.5 lakh were stolen by Thakur. “We seized a high-end car, which sported a ‘police’ sign in the front and a beacon on top. He is not a policeman and could have used the car and beacon for impersonation. An ID card from the home minister’s office found on him will be verified,” said Kadam. The Panvel resident’s profile on a career-oriented online service says he is an endocrinologist with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Police will verify if the content on the page is genuine. He has no connections or contacts on the page.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/doc-held-for-stealing-gold-of-techie-who-he-was-dating-in-mumbai/articleshow/81559180.cms||Nitasha Natu

The deceased had to share one mobile with two other siblings, leading her to miss out on classes which affected her mentally. Over the past few months since lockdown, online classes have taken a huge toll on many students’ mental well being, especially those hailing from underprivileged families. Deceased Priya Degama, daughter of a paan-kiosk owner, consumed some poisonous substance on February 15 at her house in Maldhari Society in Rajkot and succumbed on February 20 in a private hospital in Gondal. In his statement to the police, the girl’s father, Govardhan said, “Priya was a bright student, but there was just one smartphone which the three children had to share. Her brother studies in Class VI and sister in Class IX and they too used the same phone for their classes.” According to the police, Govardhan earns a paltry income from his paan shop and can never afford separate phones for the three children. Investigating officer PA Gohel said that as a result of this, Priya was forced to miss several classes and her studies were badly hit. “She went into depression over the months and ultimately took the drastic step,” Gohel said, adding that the hapless father even took Priya to Gondal for treatment as he knew a doctor there and would not have to incur huge medical expenses. Earlier, Khushi Shingadia, a Class VI girl too had committed suicide in the city in June last year fed up of online classes and homework. Her father, an auto garage owner, had purchased a mobile phone worth Rs 10,000 for her despite his personal financial hardship.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/online-studies-claim-life-of-class-xi-rajkot-girl/articleshow/81555351.cms||---

We will begin with districts where the case load is increasing steadily. And in a week’s time the daily average of Covid-19 tests will be increased to 1.5 lakh. The daily tests will be a mix of RTPCR, CBNAAT, Trunat and rapid antigen tests,” Singh said, adding that the proportion of RTPCR tests will be increased further to 70%. “The goal set by the PM of conducting 70% RTPCR tests will be met very soon,” the minister said. Regarding the wastage of vaccines, the health minister said, “At 8.5% the proportion of vaccine wastage was well within the accepted range of 10%, but the state will strive to bring it down further – first below national average.

---||Lucknow||UP readying proposal to inoculate 18-45 age group||LUCKNOW: Anticipating a rise in coronavirus cases during the Holi season, the UP government is working on a proposal to vaccinate the 18-45 age group as well. Besides, the proposal, to be sent to the Centre soon for approval, would also seek a nod for lifting the mandatory comorbidity condition for those in their 50s. This means that those in the 50s may just walk in with their age proofs to get vaccinated. The proposals are subject to approval from the Union ministry of health and family welfare. UP health minister Jai Pratap Singh said that UP’s strategy has worked well so far in containment of the pandemic which reflects in its high recovery and low mortality rate, but admitted that the state was ready to tweak the plan in public interest under the guidance of the Union health ministry. As per the proposal, younger people in the 18-45 age group should be allowed to take the Covid-19 vaccine especially if they have any co-morbid condition like type-1 diabetes, medically diagnosed hypertension or cardiac condition. Those with any kind of auto-immune diseases or on immuno-suppressant medication may also be allowed. Discussions over inclusion of certain groups of professionals like teachers and banking staff is also being deliberated upon. To achieve herd immunity, UP must vaccinate 30% of its 22.79 crore population, which is approximately 6.8 crore. So far, about 34 lakh persons have been vaccinated in the state which is about 5% of the target. Therefore, vaccination must be opened for more groups, said a health department official. Besides, sources said, inclusion of those in 18-45 years is being considered to cut down the anticipated spread of the pandemic infection among people in this age group as they are more mobile than elders. “These are the people who may be silent spreaders. Data shows that while a large majority of them were asymptomatic, they are carriers of the virus. Therefore, their inclusion is crucial to control the spread,” said a health department official||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-readying-proposal-to-inoculate-18-45-age-group/articleshow/81559207.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Kolkata||KMC looks for contamination source, starts pipe replacement||Kolkata: The civic water supply department has replaced several pipelines in the contamination zone in Bhowanipore to minimize the possibility of a repeat of last week’s incident when several dozen people had fallen ill, complaining of stomach cramps. At least three persons died after such complaints in the past few days. However, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) Board of Administrators (BoA) chairman Firhad Hakim ruled out water contamination as cause of those deaths, but admitted there could be a problem in water supply in pockets. “I am not saying there was no contamination in water anywhere in the zone. But going by medical reports, no deaths have occurred due to contamination in water. Our engineers have taken extensive measures to ensure that people get safe drinking water in the troubled zone,” Hakim said. KMC engineers on Wednesday decided to also widen and intensify their search for the contamination source. Test reports of water samples collected in phases from Sashisekhar Bose Row and Bijay Bose Road haven’t pointed to presence of pathogens or coliform bacteria in alarming quantities. KMC water supply department director-general Mainak Mukherjee on Tuesday said several water samples collected from the trouble zone had tested negative for contamination. Sources in the KMC water supply department said the civic body had collected 16 samples from areas across ward 73 and 74 in the past three days, including Sashisekhar Bose Row, Rani Sankari Lane, Telipara Road, Parbati Chakraborty Lane and D L Khan Road. Though no contamination could be found in the samples, the KMC engineers didn’t want to take chances and decided to examine several household water connections and replace some of them to ensure safe drinking water could be supplied. “Going by the nature of complaints from select Bhowanipore areas, we decided to widen our scope of investigation. In the past three days, we have examined several pipelines in Bhowanipore and replaced several pipelines in some reported zones of contamination,” a KMC water supply department senior official said. He added they will continue to search for leakages in the pipelines over the next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-looks-for-contamination-source-starts-pipe-replacement/articleshow/81556720.cms||Saikat Ray

Justice V Parthiban observed that constitutional courts have been woefully reduced to a below par performer allowing mediocrity to creep into the system of writ governance by the ‘Mandamus Mania’. The judge observed that the court unfortunately has been witnessing in the recent past that plethora of mandamus writ petitions being filed at the drop of a hat for all kinds of relief as a matter of course taking away the precious time of the court from focusing on a quality litigation in true exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction. The judge observed that the trend has reached an alarming level today that a representation is submitted to the authority for his action and simultaneously a writ of mandamus is filed seeking direction to dispose of the representation. This trend, apart from belittling the constitutional jurisdiction of this writ court, lately has to an extraordinary measure been encouraging the present younger generation of lawyers to resort to mandamus litigations through a contrived route as a fast track to achieve instant result for their brief at the cost of valuable court’s time, and thereby depriving the litigants of actual reliefs deserved by them, at the first instance, observed the judge. The judge said that it is common knowledge that the authorities at various positions taking cue from the trend are by and large not inclined to discharge their official responsibility or function, unless a direction is issued by the courts on almost all matters, which should have been decided and disposed of routinely by them in a time-bound manner. “It is high time the constitutional courts did corrective judicial introspection and discourage any attempt by obsessive ‘direction seekers’ from plummeting the exalted jurisdiction of the courts into a barren, pedestrian and stupefied judicial edifice,” observed the judge. An atrophied state of ‘Mandamus Management’ requires a concerted surgical response, said the judge. The court was hearing the petition filed by G Soundarrajan, a resident of Trichy district who submitted an application for making proper entry in the revenue records of a land after obtaining a decree in his favour from the civil court. The court dismissed the petition observing that when the authority was inquiring into the matter, the petitioner had moved court without providing reasonable time to the authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mandamus-mania-affects-performance-of-courts-hc/articleshow/81557878.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Officials of Bansal Pathways, the company that is taking care of the redevelopment work, claimed that structural work has been completed. This redevelopment work was given the new deadline of March 31, 2021, a year later than the previous deadline of March 31, 2020, due to pandemic related issues. Abu Asif, project manager of Bansal Pathways, said, "It's a great achievement to complete this pilot PPP railway station redevelopment project under IRSDC.” He claimed that spread of Covid-19 virus affected the project.

The size of a plantation could range from a few hectares to a few thousand hectares.It said the move would adversely impact many farmers. “Production will drop in large plantations, if adequate fertilizer is not applied. Entitlement should be based on land holdings and land area is a more practical criterion,” the letter read.Stating that the proposed restrictions would have serious implications on the export competitiveness of plantation commodities and deny farmers a level playing field in the international market, Prashant Bhansali, president, Upasi, said, “The proposed measures will no way help in preventing the misuse of fertilizer. It will only put growers of plantation crops in a difficult situation. Therefore, it is not justifiable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/allocate-subsidized-fertilizers-based-on-plantation-size/articleshow/81557888.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

If all goes well, teachers working in degree colleges will be able to mentor PhD students from the new academic session. The move is aimed at encouraging research in colleges and giving an opportunity to teachers to act as research guides. The state government has constituted a seven-member committee under basic education minister Satish Chandra Dwivedi, and with additional chief secretary, higher education, Monika S Garg as member secretary, to deliberate on promoting research and fixing norms for teachers to supervise research. Till now, only university teachers and college teachers teaching post graduate courses were eligible for supervising research. ACS Garg said college teachers teaching UG students have same qualifications as their counterparts in universities. “College teachers understand local problems better and can help students take up innovative research projects,” Garg added. The New Education Policy also offers a degree with research under four-year undergraduate level if the student completes a stipulated research project. “The move will have dual purpose. It will bring uniformity among all colleges and universities in the state, giving everyone a level-playing field and two, it will promote research among UG students,” said Prof Nishi Pandey of Lucknow University who is also member of the committee. “Unique and innovative ideas can come from colleges also. Teachers and students should not be at disadvantage just because they are associated with degree colleges,” Pandey said. The government has also introduced a three-year research and development (R&D) project to encourage teachers of state-run varsities and colleges to undertake research. Subsequently, teachers from colleges will be given grants for quality work on national and international issues. The allowance will be given only to permanent teachers. Moreover, the grant will not be limited to science stream but will also be given for humanities and commerce subjects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/big-leap-college-teachers-tomentor-phd-students-soon/articleshow/81559237.cms||Isha Jain

This is also the highest single-day spike that the district has recorded so far this year. The worrying factor is that the caseload has gone up by 25% in just a day – from 81 on Tuesday to 107 on Wednesday.The active Covid-19 cases in the district have also shot up to 506 on the day, from 448 on Tuesday. While the district has seen 56,731 Covid cases so far, 55,539 of them, including the 49 patients who were discharged from treatment centres on Wednesday, have recovered.District collector K Rajamani attributed the rise in cases to carelessness among the people in following the standard operating procedures. “There was a time when the district used to record more than 650 cases a day. And we don’t want to go back to that stage again. Hence, I sincerely request everyone to follow norms and get tested immediately after developing symptoms.”He took to the streets on the day to request and remind the people to follow Covid-19 precautions. He visited the Gandhipuram bus stand and with the help of public announcement system urged the people to wear their masks properly, maintain social distancing and wash their hands at frequent intervals.Pointing out that the daily spike in cases has more than doubled in the district, the collector also sought their cooperation to bring the caseload under control.Rajamani said he had already appealed all the political parties and candidates to ensure adherence to face mask etiquette and social distancing during door-to-door campaigns and meetings. “Political parties are doing an important job of getting people to come out and vote, which is important for our democracy. We want voters to wear masks. We have created awareness among them too.”The collector told TOI that he has instructed city corporation officials to focus more on areas such as Ganapathy, RS Puram, Saibaba Colony, Peelamedu and Saravanampatti. “There are family clusters in these areas and they could grow bigger if not taken care of properly.”The city corporation, meanwhile, continued to crack down on the people without face masks and shops that failed to ensure Covid-19 norms. The civic body collected a total fine of Rs 88,250 - Rs 74,200 from 371 people for not wearing face masks and Rs 14,050 from 25 shops for not ensuring the standard operating procedures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/daily-spike-in-covid-cases-crosses-100-mark-in-dist/articleshow/81557893.cms||---

The seventh phase of excavation was started in Keeladi on February 13 by the chief minister and work started in Keeladi for the seventh time and in its neighbouring villages of Konthagai, Manalur, and Agaram for the second time. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/burial-urn-found-in-konthagai/articleshow/81557891.cms||---

---||Lucknow||48 out of 75 seats for zila panchayat election reserved||Lucknow: Out of 75 seats of zila panchayat in the state, only 27 would be unreserved for the forthcoming three-tier elections to be held shortly. Two days after the Allahabad high court asked the state government to follow the 2015 as the base year for seat reservation in panchayat elections, the state government on Wednesday formally came up with guidelines for reservation of seats in the rural local bodies’ polls. As per the guidelines issued by the state government, the reservation of seats for SC/ST and OBC would be done as per their ratio in the total population. There are 75 posts of chairman for zila panchayats, 826 for kshetra panchayat and 58194 for gram panchayats. While 23%of the post will be reserved for the SC/ST, 27% would be reserved for the OBC. The guidelines said that in case of Zila panchayat, no seat would be reserved for ST. Out of 48 reserved seats, 16 seats would be reserved for SC, 20 seats for OBC and 12 for women. Out of 16 SC and 20 OBC seats, six and seven seats respectively would be reserved for women. So, in effect, 25 seats, or 33% of the total, are reserved for women. In case of Kshetra panchayat five seats would be reserved for ST, 171 seats for SC and 223 seats for OBC. In case of gram panchayat, 330 seats would be reserved for STs, 12045 for SCs and 15712 for OBC, the guidelines said. The state government has decided to reserve seats on a rotational basis vis-à-vis 2015 base year. Therefore seats reserved for SC/ST/OBCs in 2015 would not hold the same status. The administration of different districts would now prepare a formal proposal for reservations of seats in gram panchayats, kshetra panchayat and zila panchayat between Thursday and Friday. The list of reserved seats would be published between March 20 and 22 and objections would be invited from March 20 and 23 March. The final list would be published by March 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/48-out-of-75-seats-for-zila-panchayat-election-reserved/articleshow/81559323.cms||Pankaj Shah

Two years ago, when the single-use plastic ban kicked in, a North Chennai trader said it would not last more than a few months. However, for more than six months, people carried their own cloth bags wherever they went. The corporation had collected more than Rs 1cr in fine as well and conducted daily raids in shops and restaurants. But now, two years after the plastic ban in the state, the ambitious attempt has come a cropper, a according to a study by Citizen Consumer and Civic Action Group (CAG). The researchers visited 1,936 retail shops in major commercial hubs Koyambedu, Pondy Bazaar, Adyar, Sowcarpet and Thiruvanamalai. They found ‘banned’ single-use plastic bags in each of these shops. Almost 50% of roadside eateries and bigger restaurants still use plastic containers for packaging, while 63% of the local packaging materials used in Tamil Nadu was non-recyclable material. The objective of the study was to find the usage of plastic after the pandemic in the city. Vamsi Kapilavai, senior researcher, CAG, one of the researchers said that the findings point to the fact that plastic ban is not being implemented at all. “The steps they have taken has not worked. The government has to work at the policy level. They need to define what constitutes a single-use plastic and more items should be included to this list,” he said. He added that unless there is an ecosystem of alternatives the ban cannot be enforced at all. The government should facilitate and help industries with policies that provide incentives for not using plastic goods,” he said. Smriti Sharma, head, public policy (operations), Amazon, said on an average, Indians use 11 kg of plastic in a year compared to 109 kg per year used by residents of the US. A Greater Chennai Corporation official, when contacted, said the only solution is conducting awareness and education programmes and enforcement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/plastic-ban-exists-but-only-on-paper/articleshow/81554808.cms||---

Aurangabad municipal administrator Astik Kumar Pandey has announced increasing the civic-run centres’ total bed capacity to 5,000. As on date, the Covid facilities run by the civic body have a total bed capacity of 2,000. Out of the newly-announced beds, about 500 were added in the last three days. Moreover, Aurangabad district has started reporting over 1,000 positive cases recently, most of which have been reported from the civic body’s limits, prompting the authorities to scale up the infrastructure for accommodating the ever increasing number of patients. Authorities in the health department acknowledged the challenge for identifying and hiring skilled manpower in the form of medicos, Ayush doctors as well as paramedical staffers.“Hiring ineligible staffers would risk lives of the patients lodged at the Covid facilities and that is the reason we are screening every applicant health staffer,” said an officer privy to the recruitment process. Civic body’s health officer Dr. Neeta Padalkar told TOI, “As on date, we have about 300 staffers. Amidst second wave of coronavirus, we are in need of 250 more health staffers, including medicos, Ayush doctors and paramedical staffers, for which the recruitment is underway.” She said that there is no dearth of funds as the district administration is providing money for paying salaries of these newly-recruited staffers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/dearth-of-healthcare-staff-a-big-challenge-in-aurangabad/articleshow/81554803.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On Wednesday, Surat Textile Goods Transport Association (STGTA) alleged that police did not register the complaint of some loot incidents that took place from moving trucks on highways in Navsari and Valsad.  However, police claimed that the transporters are miffed due to the action taken against them. “Navsari police did not register a complaint in a February 26 incident in which 139 textile parcels were looted by some robbers near Boriyach toll plaza. The driver too was kidnapped,” claimed Yuvraj Desle, president of STGTA.  Desle further alleged, “Similarly, goods were looted in three incidents on Chikhli-Saputara highway when the drivers slowed down near railway crossing. But no complaint was registered by the police.”  Meanwhile, senior police officials claim that the transporters are not ready to follow the instructions to prevent any crime. “Police held a couple of meetings with transporters and they have been instructed to follow some guidelines, but they are not doing so. Police will look into their concerns and take actions,” said Rajkumar Pandian, range IGP, Surat.  Police have asked transporters to instruct the truck drivers not to stop anywhere on the highway during the night even if someone tries to stop them as a government officer without a uniform. They should stop only at hotels where proper lighting and CCTV coverage is available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/police-dont-register-our-loot-complaints-transporters-claim/articleshow/81555486.cms||---

Two of his associates were arrested earlier this month, but the accused, Adil alias Shakeel, had managed to give police a slip. In the incident, which happened last month, constables Sandeep and Bhupinder tried to stop the trio at a picket near JJ Colony, Bhalswa Dairy at 6.15pm on February 25, but they attempted to flee. When a police team chased them, they opened fire in which constable Sandeep was injured, a cop said.

---||Goa||Terminate Garg, probe his assets, Congress writes to MHA||PANAJI: Congress on Wednesday wrote to the Union ministry of home affairs demanding the termination of IAS officer Chokha Ram Garg for not upholding the Constitution while appointed as law secretary in Goa. The party, which alleges that Garg was biased in favour of BJP, has also sought an investigation into Garg’s sources of income. It has also written to chief secretary Parimal Rai urging him to relieve Garg as law secretary. “We have asked the MHA to suspend Garg because he isattempted to over-reach the court and an inquiry should be held against him to see if he has disproportionate assets,” state Congress president Girish Chodankar said. Garg, a 2008 batch IAS officer was appointed as law secretary and subsequently as state election commissioner following the resignation of the earlier incumbernt R K Shrivastava. Garg oversaw the zilla panchayat elections and had initiated the election process for 11 municipal elections which were eventually challenged before the high court of Bombay at Goa and the Supreme Court. Chodankar in his complaints said that the BJP government chose to appoint Garg as SEC instead of finding an independent officer in order to have a “pliable” authority. The Supreme Court in its verdict on the municipal poll reservation process had noted that Garg flouted the constitutional mandate and attempted to over-reach the judiciary. “The law secretary is the highest law officer of the state and if such a man is going to guide the state, I don’t think he is fit to even sit for a day as the law secretary or as an IAS officer. We can’t have such type of people misguiding the government and the best place is to send them home,” former assistant solicitor general of India and Congress’s legal cell’s chairman Carlos Alvares Ferreira said. Congress said that the IAS officer had brought disrepute to the IAS fraternity. It also demanded that the election and legal expenses incurred by the state and by candidates should be recovered from Garg. Box Former GFP spokesperson Tanveer Khatib returned to Congress fold on Wednesday along with Nilkant Mhapsekar. Khatib had quit GFP in 2017 after the party aligned with BJP to form the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/terminate-garg-probe-his-assets-cong-writes-to-mha/articleshow/81557917.cms||---

The public representatives will spread public awareness about benefits of getting vaccinated and dispel myths associated with immunization programmes from the minds of a section of beneficiaries,”he said. Pandey said that only around 50,000 vaccine doses have been administered in Aurangabad so far against the sanctioned supply of three lakh doses. “The increase in vaccination cover is essential to contain the spread of the disease and bring down mortality rate to zero. The mass vaccination against Covid-19 can prove to be a game-changer in the battle against the pandemic in year 2021 as we were not empowered with such effective weapon last year,” he said. In his public address through Facebook live, Pandey downplayed the panic associated with the record rise in daily cases of Covid-19. In keeping with the record rapid rise in new cases, Aurangabad district on Tuesday reported highest ever 1,271 fresh cases of Covid-19, including 1,011 within the municipal limits. “The virus, in its present form, is more contagious in nature, but many infected patients are exhibiting only mild symptoms. Such patients will be officially encouraged to undergo home isolation for Covid treatment,” he said. Pandey added, “The option of home isolation can be explored only after the consent from the civic health authorities. Such a patient must have a pulse oximeter with him or her to keep aconstant check on oxygen level in body.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/amc-launches-my-ward-100-vaccinatedward-campaign-to-increase-vaccination-coverage/articleshow/81554814.cms||---

She has now become a constable in Jharkhand Police. “CM sir asked me: Ab to khush ho na?” she said. A resident of Pathragonda village in Ranchi’s Kanke block and a karate champion who had bagged gold in the 34th National Games in Ranchi in 2011, Vimala made headlines last October when a video surfaced showing her selling hariya (rice beer) by the road to make ends meet. “I will now be able to focus on my performance in the upcoming tournaments and not think about money. I am gunning for the 36th National Games in Goa later this year. I will put all my efforts into preparations,” Munda told TOI. Speaking at the event, Soren rued that the successive state governments remained reluctant to do anything for the welfare of athletes and sports development. “We got late in realizing their problems and needs. The state government is now working out ways to ensure that more and more athletes and sportspersons can be recruited into government jobs depending on their qualifications and abilities,” Soren told the audience. Munda was among the 36 athletes from Jharkhand who were appointed as constables in a formal ceremony at Project Building auditorium. Of them, 27 – including 17 women -- turned up personally and collected their appointment letters from Soren. It is the first direct recruitment of athletes in government jobs in Jharkhand in 20 years. Munda and the 35 others were recruited in group C category. The athletes come from various disciplines such as archery, wushu, handball, karate, boxing, lawn ball and Taekwondo. Their names were cleared for appointment by the home department following the recommendation of a screening committee headed by chief secretary Sukhdev Singh. “Initially, 40 athletes were shortlisted for recruitment. Of them, one has already joined as a district sports officer recently. While the 36 are being handed their appointment letters, the remaining three will be given their appointment letters next week,” sports secretary Puja Singhal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-recruits-36-athletes-in-police-dept/articleshow/81555100.cms||Dhritiman Ray

---||Ranchi||BJP unwilling to give up Madhupur to ally Ajsu-P||RANCHI: A day after the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the bypoll date for Madhupur, BJP on Wednesday indicated that it is no mood to compromise and will bargain hard with its NDA ally, Ajsu Party, to field a candidate from the saffron camp. The Madhupur assembly seat, which fell vacant in October last year after the death of Haji Hussain Ansari at a Ranchi-based private hospital due to post Covid-19 complications, is slated to go for the by-election on April 17. A senior BJP leader, who is a part of the core committee in Jharkhand, told TOI, “BJP will name its own candidate for Madhupur. Ajsu Party will have to withdraw its claim over the seat as we have already accommodated them in the upcoming Bengal polls by giving them one seat.” Earlier this month, BJP announced its candidates for the first two phases of the eight-phase assembly election in West Bengal and it left Baghmundi in Purulia for the Sudesh Mahto-led party. “BJP also gave Ajsu Party one seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. However, during the assembly polls in Jharkhand that year, they parted ways with us over disagreements regarding seat-sharing, even though they returned to the NDA fold later. Now that the bypoll date has been announced, things will be sorted out,” the senior BJP leader said. Another party worker said, “BJP has a natural claim over Madhupur as it came second in the 2019 assembly polls. In addition to this, BJP had won that seat in 2014 when Raj Paliwar contested from there. There can be two possibilities — either Raj Paliwar is fielded again or if Ajsu Party tries to exert pressure on us, then we will ask them to name their own candidate but he/she has to fight on a BJP ticket.” He, however, said that it is very difficult to say anything concrete now as things are at a nascent stage. When asked to comment on the matter, BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said, “BJP is all set to give a crushing defeat to UPA in Madhupur. Our party is now stronger after the return of Ajsu Party into the NDA fold.” He added that the party’s state election committee is scheduled to meet soon to finalise the candidate. “As far as the candidate is concerned, the top brass of BJP and Ajsu Party will conduct a joint meeting to recommend names to the party high command,” he said. Ajsu Party president Sudesh Mahto or its central spokesperson Deosharan Bhagat were not available for comments when TOI tried contacting them. On the other hand, there are no indications of a possible disagreement among the grand alliance partners – JMM, Congress and RJD – over Madhupur. Initially, though, RJD staked claim over it but later relented after JMM, in a surprise move, inducted Ansari’s son Hafizul Hassan this year. As a result of this, Hussain is now a natural contestant of the UPA for Madhupur. On Wednesday, state labour minister and RJD’s Chatra MLA Satyanand Bhokta said the party will support the alliance candidate. “UPA will fight in Madhupur collectively to ensure Hafizul Hassan’s victory,” he added. Chief minister and JMM working president Hemant Soren said JMM is well-prepared to fight and win the bypoll. “JMM is on a winning streak (besides the 2019 assembly polls, the party won the Dumka seat and Congress won Bermo during last year’s bypolls) and this time too, the outcome of the election will be in our favour,” he added.

---||Ranchi||Lack of CNG stations leaves auto drivers in long queues||RANCHI: Although the state government had envisioned a noble cause by introducing clean fuel norms, forcing auto-rickshaws to shift to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Gas Authority of India Limited’s inability to establish the required number of CNG stations are leaving the vehicle owners in the lurch as long queues at filling stations leave drivers with less hours of operation. TOI spoke to several auto-rickshaw owners who have either converted their commercial vehicles to CNG or have purchased new vehicles which were made mandatory for operating inside city limits. They said their livelihood is being affected as the existing fuelling stations aren’t able to fulfil their demand. Mubarak Ansari of Doranda said, “The supply tankers do not reach the city on time, leading to long queues. I operate between Ranchi railway station and Hatia and in order to make up for the time lost at the filling station, I have to queue up early in the morning. Evenings are a mad rush.” Sanjay Kumar, who operates on the same route, said, “At times, we have to wait for more than three to four hours. How are we supposed to do business if we spend so much time to refuel?” CNG stations were launched in the city in August 2019 after the state government started issuing permits for CNG vehicles as a part of their promotion of clean fuel. A total of four refuelling stations one each at Doranda, Hatia, Ormanjhi and Kokar area were opened. However, GAIL was supposed to open 35 stations in the city. According to sources at GAIL, currently they are able to supply around 500 kg of CNG through gas tankers which comes to city from either Durgapur in West Bengal or Patna in Bihar. However, they have assured transport department officials that their supply centre will soon be functional in Bokaro and they will ensure a hassle-free supply after that. Taking cognizance of the matter, state transport department convened a meeting with GAIL authorities on Tuesday and directed them to ensure supply of 10,000 kg of CNG to the city on a daily basis. “We have directed GAIL to ensure availability within a week’s time so that auto-rickshaw drivers do not face inconvenience,” said a press note issued by transport commissioner Kiran Pasi’s office. Meanwhile, GAIL officials were not available for a comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/lack-of-cng-stations-leaves-auto-drivers-in-long-queues/articleshow/81555170.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Most pupils to get promoted, no rank, expect results online||RANCHI: School students are likely to be promoted to the next class, irrespective of their performance in the examinations or internal assessment conducted by the schools, and most schools have decided to do away with ranks this year. These decisions have been taken at individual schools in absence of guidelines from the CBSE, ICSE or the state education department. Most schools affiliated to the CBSE board have decided to declare results online. Jawahar Vidya Mandir (JVM) Shyamali principal Samarjit Jana said they will declare the results online for students from nursery to Class IX while the results of Class X and XII students who appeared in pre-board examinations will be issued offline. “We will be lenient in terms of promotion and a student will only be detained if it is found absolutely necessary for his or her improvement,” he said, adding that no rank would be awarded this time in the wake of difficulty that the students and school management faced due to lockdown. Another CBSE school, Surendranath Centenary School, also plans to upload the results online. Vice-principal Debashish Bhattacharya said the school is associated with Mercantile Institute of Computer Application, which will prepare the virtual report cards for the students. “Students facing network interruptions were given 24 hours to submit the answer sheets physically,” he said, clarifying that his school will not detain any student this year. Oxford Public School principal Suraj Sharma said his institution will conduct a retest for students who could not perform well in the online exam. He also clarified that all will be promoted to the next class. A majority of ICSE schools are preparing to publish the results offline. Bishop Westcott Girls’ School principal Jacqueline Edwin said, “The results will be offline, but the dates and timing will be staggered to ensure social distancing on the campus.” Sources said the entire Bishop group has opted for the same pattern. Another school under ICSE board, St Xavier’s, has also decided to promote every student. Schoolteacher Santosh Kumar said “We are not ranking students. The decision on the mode of the results is yet to be taken.” Meanwhile schools under the Jharkhand Academic Council will follow government guidelines on the issue. Ursuline Convent principal Mary Kanta Kerketta said two exams were conducted since the lockdown. “The final examination is going on and we are waiting for directives if everyone is supposed to be promoted,” she said. Officials in the department of school education and literacy were not available for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/most-pupils-to-get-promoted-no-rank-expect-results-online/articleshow/81556083.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||Will consider freedom fighter tag to statehood activists: Alam||RANCHI: Answering to a call attention motion raised by Ajsu-P leader Sudesh Mahto, parliamentary affairs minister Alamgir Alam said the state government will consider giving freedom fighter status to activists of the statehood movement although there is no such proposal under consideration of the state. Mahto said the government should honour their contribution and while offering them fourth grade jobs, it should be taken care that they are not engaged in menial jobs as servants to bureaucrats. Alam said the government will keep sentiments in consideration and employ them directly to grade three and four positions depending upon their qualification and skill. Mahto suggested the government should work towards educating and skilling the descendants of statehood martyrs. “Enroll them in schools like Netarhat Vidyalaya for education,” Mahto said. He further pointed that financial assistance of Rs 30,000 for medical facilities was too meagre which cannot even support the cost of medicines in a family of five. “Statehood activists who were in jail for up to six months are being paid Rs 6,000 per month while Rs 7,500 per month is being paid to those who served a longer term,” Alam said. In another call attention motion, BJP’s Biranchi Narayan asked the government to come up with a tourism policy and give at least eight facilities at each of the 131 sites of tourism in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/will-consider-freedom-fighter-tag-to-statehood-activists-alam/articleshow/81556316.cms||---
---||Goa||Coastal body overturns own ruling on Sernabatim hotel citing ‘fatal flaw’||PANAJI: In a unique case, the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) has found a ‘fatal flaw’ in its own directives for demolition issued earlier to a hotel at Sernabatim. Overturning the decision, GCZMA has said that only some illegal portions of the hotel will be demolished and not the entire structure. The authority found that for many portions of the hotel, for which demolition orders had been issued, the owner was in possession of valid permissions. GCZMA also found that these portions were constructed prior to the 1991 CRZ notification. “From the records available in the file, which were to be perused by the members (of GCZMA), no showcause notice has been issued pinpointing as to against which structures the authority intends to take action. There is only a notice of personal hearing issued from time to time, which culminated in passing the final decision. This was one of the fatal flaw in the proceedings,” the GCZMA said in its decision taken at a meeting earlier this month. The GCZMA observed that the property for the hotel was purchased from a previous owner as early as 1981 and the documents clearly mentioned hotel Silver Sands’ existence. The structures on the survey plan did not match the existing ones only because the old structures had been demolished to make way for new constructions. “The voluminous documentary evidence, more specifically the approved plans, having the stamp of approval of various departments much prior to February 19, 1991, is substantial proof to indicate that the offending structure was existing much before the CRZ norms could come into force,” the GCZMA said. However, the authority found that the ground truthing does show that some of the hotel’s structures have been constructed without any approvals. “These (structures) identified by the officials of Inspector of Survey and Land Records (ISLR), Salcette, should nevertheless be demolished. The decision taken by the authority in its earlier meeting is partly rescinded to the extent that the additional structures constructed by the respondent (hotel owner), which are not part of the approved plan and identified by the ISLR though ground truthing report, be demolished and not the entire structure,” the GCZMA directives state. The case pertaining to the Sernabatim hotel was reopened by GCZMA after the owner approached the high court and the state advocate general opined that GCZMA should hear the parties again and decide if a review is permissible or not. “It is brought to the notice of the members that the current proceedings are unique in as much as unlike other cases the respondent possessed the requisite permissions and approvals to construct the commercial structure way back in the year 1978, 1980 and 1984 even the final occupancy has been given to him in the mid of 1980’s,” the GCZMA noted in its decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/coastal-body-overturns-own-ruling-on-sernabatim-hotel-citing-fatal-flaw/articleshow/81557995.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Politicians must respect the people who elect them’||PANAJI: Elected representatives should never forget that the power they wield comes from the people who elect them and thus, politicians need to show respect for the electorate, president of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), Geneva, Duarte Pacheco said. Pacheco, who is on a two-day visit to Goa, also offered to assist the state while framing legislation. “Politicians should always realize that power is not ours. Power is of the people,” Pacheco said after meeting speaker Rajesh Patnekar at the assembly complex. “Parliamentarians should be respected, but they should also respect the people.” Patnekar said that Pacheco’s visit would strengthen the relations between Goa and Portugal even more. Pacheco said the IPU is willing to help every nation enact legislations and also train new elected representatives. “You can ask IPU for help on what kind of legislation has success in most nations and then you can study and adapt them for your country or state. You don’t have to start from zero. If you need budget formation for new MPs and MLAs, you can ask the IPU and we are ready to send people that are experienced,” Pacheco said. Pacheco was elected as president of the IPU in November 2020 for a period of three year. A member of parliament in Portugal since 1991, Pacheco is the first Portuguese national to be elected to the post. He is on a seven-day visit to India. India supported Pacheco’s candidature and his first official visit to India is a move to express Portugal’s gratitude. The IPU has 179 member parliaments out of the 193 countries in the world. Pacheco, who addressed members of parliament three days earlier in Delhi, decided to make an official trip to Goa due to historical ties between Goa and Portugal. “We share values, we share brothers, we share the same will to have a better world where it is possible for everyone with different political beliefs, vision to live together side by side,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/politicians-must-respect-the-people-who-elect-them/articleshow/81558029.cms||---
---||World||US House passes domestic violence bill, pushes issue to Senate||WASHINGTON: With a nod to Women's History Month, the Democratic-led House passed two measures Wednesday, one designed to protect women from domestic violence, the other to remove the deadline for states to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. The reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act passed 244-172 with 29 Republicans joining Democrats in supporting the legislation. The resolution to repeal the ERA's ratification deadline passed 222-204. Both measures face a more difficult path in an evenly divided Senate. The White House announced its support earlier Wednesday for reauthorizing VAWA, which aims to reduce domestic and sexual violence and improve the response to it through a variety of grant programs. Many of the Democratic congresswomen wore all-white outfits to commemorate the day, a nod to the women's suffrage movement when marchers would wear white dresses to symbolized the femininity and purity of their cause. President Joe Biden introduced the original Violence Against Women Act in June 1990 when serving as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. A subsequent version was eventually included in a sweeping crime bill that President Bill Clinton would sign into law four years later. Congress has reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act three times since. Biden applauded the House action and urged the Senate to follow suit. ``This should not be a Democratic or Republican issue _ it's about standing up against the abuse of power and preventing violence,`` the president said in a statement Wednesday evening. The original bill created the Office on Violence Against Women within the Justice Department, which has awarded more than $9 billion in grants to state and local governments, nonprofits and universities over the years. The grants fund crisis intervention programs, transitional housing and legal assistance to victims, among other programs. Supporters said the reauthorization would also boost spending for training law enforcement and the courts. ``This bill leaves no victim behind,`` said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas. The legislation also would prohibit persons previously convicted of misdemeanor stalking from possessing firearms, a provision that generated opposition from the NRA and resulted in most Republicans voting against the measure in the last Congress. The other measure the House took up Wednesday would remove the deadline for states to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, a decades-long effort to amend the Constitution to expressly prohibit discrimination based on sex. Congress initially required the states to ratify it by 1979, a deadline it later extended to 1982. The Justice Department under President Donald Trump said Congress cannot revive a proposed constitutional amendment after the deadline for its ratification has expired. Supporters would have to start over and follow Article V of the Constitution, which requires support from two-thirds of each chamber of Congress and ratification from three-quarters of the states before an amendment is added to the Constitution. The fight over the Equal Rights Amendment began almost a century ago. The amendment finally passed with the requisite majority in each chamber when President Richard Nixon was serving his first term. Shortly after Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the amendment last year, the archivist of the United States declared he would take no action to certify the amendment's adoption, citing the Justice Department opinion. Earlier this month, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by three Democratic state attorneys general that had sought to force the federal government to recognize Virginia's vote. A White House official said Biden supported the Equal Rights Amendment when he served in Congress and remains committed to it, but he won't direct the Office of Legal Counsel to rescind its opinion or to reach a particular conclusion out of respect for the Justice Department's independence. The official said Biden considered the House vote the appropriate next step. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., noted that a champion of the amendment, the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, had said it was time to start anew. ``This measure is brazenly unconstitutional,'' McClintock said. ``If the majority were serious, they would reintroduce the ERA and debate it openly and constitutionally as Ginsburg suggests.'' The ERA faced bitter opposition from some conservatives, who say it could be used as a legal tool to fight state efforts to curb abortion. ``If ratified, the ERA would be used to codify the right to abortion, undoing pro-life protections and forcing taxpayers to fund abortions,`` warned Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz. Supporters argued that the Constitution does not guarantee that all the rights it protects are held equally by all citizens without regard to sex. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., the sponsor of the resolution to repeal the ratification deadline, said there is no expiration date on equality. ``We demand that we be put into the Constitution,`` Speier said. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the Constitution places no deadlines on the process of ratifying constitutional amendments and that Congress clearly has the authority to extend or remove any deadlines it chose to set previously. ``We are on the brink of making history and no deadline should stand in the way,`` Nadler said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-house-passes-domestic-violence-bill-pushes-issue-to-senate/articleshow/81560526.cms||---

If they visit these research institutes now, the liking and interest towards science will develop. Along with knowledge, practical experiences are also important,” Sawant said. He said the state government vide the department of science, technology and waste management will hold the annual scientific event, Manohar Parrikar Vidnyan Mahotsav, in a virtual mode this year. Entertainment Society of Goa’s vice-chairman, Subhash Phal Desai said that an education policy framed by intellectuals will help in shaping young minds. “The new educational policy has a vision to bring India at forefront in the field of innovation and research. We have a good intellectual potential in our country and wherever the Indians go, they leave their footprints of which we are proud,” he said. NIO director, Sunil Kumar Singh said that there is need to take science seriously for an exponential evolution. “Hence, there is a great need to make scientific knowledge available to everyone,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-need-to-ignite-young-minds-with-innovation/articleshow/81558095.cms||---

The approval is the final tranche of payments to settle the main claims of now frustrated depositors. Earlier this month, DICGC had given an in-principle nod to MUCB liquidator Daulat Hawaldar to release Rs 149.3 crore to 12,977 depositors from the liquid funds that MUCB has. The money, said MUCB official, will be released in the coming weeks. “It is further informed that the final tranche of main claim settlement amount of Rs 72.2 crore for 5,687 claims has been released to liquidator,” said deputy general manager DICGC Shariq Hoda. DICGC had on February 1 given MUCB the nod to release Rs 7 crore to depositors who had less than Rs 10,000 in their bank accounts when the bank lost its license on April 16, 2020. MUCB is going through liquidation and the DICGC and the Reserve Bank of India are overseeing the liquidation proceedings. The depositors have been waiting for access to their own funds since 2015, when the Reserve Bank of India imposed financial sanctions on the cash-strapped multi-state cooperative bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mapusa-urban-gets-nod-to-release-rs-72cr/articleshow/81558111.cms||---
---||India||Experts demand time-bound probe into post-vax deaths||NEW DELHI: Experts from diverse fields including public health, ethics, medicine and law have written an open letter expressing concern about the lack of information on the investigations of deaths following Covid-19 vaccination in India. They demanded that the government immediately undertake complete, time-bound and transparent investigation of all deaths and other serious adverse events following vaccinations and place the findings in the public domain. They stated that though they had written to the government raising the same issue on January 31, there had been no response. Signatories to the letter included Dr T Jacob John, retired professor and head of department of clinical virology in Christian Medical College, Vellore; Dr Amar Jesani, editor of Indian Journal of Medical Ethics; Dr SP Kalantri, of Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences in Wardha; Dr Sanjay Nagral, director, department of surgical gastroenterology, Jaslok Hospital; Dr Yogesh Jain, a public health physician from Chhattisgarh; Malini Aisola, of All India Drug Action Network; and senior advocates Anand Grover and Veena Johri. Referring to 65 deaths reported since the drive started on January 16, the experts pointed out that the National AEFI Committee’s probe findings of only two of these deaths have been made public. They also referred to the pausing of vaccination in European countries pending investigation into some post-vaccine deaths from blood-clotting events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/experts-demand-time-bound-probe-into-post-vax-deaths/articleshow/81560534.cms||---

Health officials investigating case histories of Covid-19 patients have now begun seeking additional information, like if the patients had attended a wedding reception in the recent past. “People do not follow Covid appropriate behaviour when in public. In fact, we discover five to six Covid-19 cases among wedding guests,” a health official said. A person who attended a wedding last week said hardly anybody at the reception wore a mask. “Although the newly-weds were wished through handshakes, no hand sanitiser was available at the venue at least for the benefit of those who were concerned about their health,” the guest said and added that reception venues are generally packed with 400-500 people, making it difficult to observe social distancing. Recently, a high-profile wedding led to several guests in Panaji and Margao testing positive for Covid-19 a few days later. While the number of guests at a wedding should not exceed 200, very few adhere to this norm. A noted caterer said most of the food orders received for wedding and engagement parties are for guest lists of 400-800 people. December to May is considered to be wedding season in Goa for most communities, with a maximum being celebrated between April and May. An official said the number of weddings scheduled for 2021 are likely to be higher when compared to the corresponding period of the previous years as those who had postponed their big day due to the Covid-19 pandemic last year, rescheduled them post-January 2021. “They could have had a small wedding limited to family and close friends last year, but postponed to have a lavish one,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/weddings-on-health-officials-radar-as-covid-19-cases-steadily-increase/articleshow/81558748.cms||---

The positive cases included two stray dogs from Sattari and one stray dog and a pet cat from Pernem. In February, the surveillance team of Mission Rabies responded to 36 suspected rabies cases of which these four were confirmed positive. A feeder in Sattari was scratched by the rabid dog and has commenced post-exposure prophylaxis. Soon after, the Bardez vaccination teams conducted ring vaccination in all areas where the positive cases were identified and distributed emergency hotline cards to as many households as possible, Mission Rabies officials said. A total of 7,095 dogs were vaccinated against rabies during February. This brings the total vaccination count, since January 1, to 14,412 dogs. Among these 7000-odd canines, a total of 96 calls received by the vaccination teams during February were for sick and injured dogs. Out of the 96 calls, 74 cases were attended last month. In addition to this, the volunteers also rescued 74 animals of which 19 dogs were released back to their original locations following treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/four-rabies-cases-detected-in-goa-in-feb/articleshow/81558154.cms||---

Besides, the proposal would also seek a nod for lifting the mandatory comorbidity condition for those in their 50s. This means that those in the 50s may be able to just walk in with their age proofs to get vaccinated. The proposals are subject to approval from the Union ministry of health and family welfare. UP health minister Jai Pratap Singh said UP’s strategy has worked well so far in containment of the pandemic, but said the state was ready to tweak the plan in public interest under the guidance of the Centre. As per the proposal, younger people in the 18-45 age group should be allowed to take the Covid vaccine especially if they have any co-morbidity like type-1 diabetes, medically diagnosed hypertension or cardiac condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-to-propose-vaccine-for-18-45-age-group/articleshow/81560562.cms||---

---||Nagpur||No tax hike in civic chief’s Rs 2,608.14cr budget for ’21-22||Nagpur: Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B on Wednesday presented Rs2,608 crore draft budget for 2021-22. He has revised budgetary estimates of the current fiscal and brought it down to Rs2,433.62 crore against former standing committee Vijay Zalke’s budget of Rs2,731 crore. Then municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe had projected NMC’s income of Rs2,547 crore for the current financial year. The municipal commissioner has also kept all taxes untouched, so there will be no additional burden on the common man. Radhakrishnan did not suggest any new revenue source, which means the civic body will have to continue with precarious finances and be dependent on government grants. The municipal commissioner’s budget, which appeared quite realistic, will come into effect from April 1. Standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar will present his budget probably in May or later, which will supersede Radhakrishnan’s budget. The standing panel chief’s budget is the same as the one presented by the civic chief, but includes some new projects and a hike in prospective revenue and expenditure assuming a huge grant from the state government. Radhakrishnan’s budget said NMC will earn Rs2,608.14 crore in the next financial year, which is Rs123 crore less than what was projected by the standing committee chief last year. As compared to the current financial year, it is a hike of just Rs174.52 crore. Despite being a local self-government, this year too NMC will continue to rely a lot on government grants. In projected income for the next financial year, Radhakrishnan expected Rs1,722.69 crore (66%) of the projected revenue from government grants while it will spend Rs806 crore on establishment. The civic chief’s budget has shown expectations of Rs332.48 crore revenue from property tax, Rs195 crore from water tax and Rs106.87 crore from town planning department. He has actually laid more focus on improving property and water tax collections. In this financial year, NMC had spent almost Rs10 crore for strengthening medical infrastructure and manpower at its hospitals. In next financial year too, NMC’s priority will be to continue to provide free RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Tests to the citizens. Besides, funds will also be spent for providing free medicines to Covid-19 patients, said the municipal commissioner. Though no new development projects have been announced, Radhakrishnan said NMC will develop a rose garden, butterfly garden, adventure park and Miyawaki garden as announced by Zalke. His budget focuses on making city air pollution free as he earmarked Rs1.92 crore for developing greenery on road dividers across the city. Municipal commissioner has stressed the need to curb pilferage in Aapli Bus ticket revenue and announced that NMC will introduce conductor-less ticketing technique in city buses, which will automatically increase revenue from public transport. Though NMC has mooted a proposal to hand over the entire city bus operation to MahaMetro, the civic chief has earmarked Rs108 crore for Aapli Bus. The civic chief’s budget gives thrust on funding ongoing projects like cement roads, malls etc. He has also kept Rs1 crore for NMC’s share to MahaMetro for Metro Rail project. Rs15 crore has been earmarked for Nag River project. The civic chief announced a 10% rebate for taxpayers if they pay property tax before June 30 of the next financial year.

---||India||‘Peace with Pak will get India direct access to central Asia’||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan PM Imran Khan on Wednesday said India will be benefitted economically by having peace with his country as it will enable New Delhi to directly access the resource-rich Central Asia region through Pakistani territory. Khan also said his government after coming to power in 2018 did everything for better ties with India and it was for India to reciprocate. “India will have to take the first step. Unless they do so, we cannot do much,” he said. India last month said that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility. Khan dwelt at length on the issue of peace in the region, including peace between Pakistan and India, saying “the unresolved Kashmir issue was the biggest hurdle between the two countries”. “If India gives the Kashmiris their right under the UN (resolutions), it will be greatly beneficial for Pakistan as well as for India,” he said and added, “India can access Central Asia after peace”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/peace-with-pak-will-get-india-direct-access-to-central-asia/articleshow/81560605.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi court finds arrest of complainant strange||NEW DELHI: A city court on Wednesday remarked that it was an "apparent absurdity" that a case relating to the alleged burning of a man's house in Shiv Vihar in northeast Delhi, an area that faced the brunt of the riots in February 2020, was clubbed with another case by Delhi Police and the man was arrested. It also came on record that the complainant, Haji Hashim Ali, had sought registration of an FIR against those who had allegedly desecrated Madina mosque and a magistrate court had subsequently ordered police to lodge the FIR. Police had challenged the magistrate's order before additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav. "It is really strange that the complaint with regard to burning of Ali's house was clubbed with the complaint of one Naresh Chand, being FIR 72/2020, at Karawal Nagar police station. Later, Ali was arrested in the same matter, meaning thereby that he was not only a complainant, but also an accused, which is an apparent absurdity," the court noted. The FIR for desecration of Madina mosque was ordered on February 1, 2021 and police informed that there was already an FIR (55/2020) registered at Karawal Nagar police station. The court, however, underscored that "no such averment was made by police" before the magistrate court. Representing Ali, the submission by advocate MR Shamshad stated, "The complaint of Ali in relation to the mosque dated June 26, 2020 named 15 members of the mob along with electronic evidence submitted to police. It was initially sought to be diluted with FIR 72/2020 in which a partial investigation was concluded by making the present applicant an accused. Police had set up a general FIR (55/2020) without naming any accused." It was alleged that the entire process appeared to be "unreasonable, shady and malafide to somehow give a predetermined closure to the brutal attack on the religious place". The judge in the order stated, "Since the issue is with regard to Madina Masjid, the specific complaint of the complainant dated June 25, 2020, bearing DD number 35A, is on record, wherein he has named 15 people as rioters, who burnt and desecrated the mosque. However, there is nothing on record with regard to the investigation in FIR 55/2020." The court, therefore, directed DCP (Northeast) to file a status report with regard to the investigation carried out in DD number 35A. “SHO, PS Karawal Nagar is directed to remain present in court on the next date of hearing along with the investigation file and the case diaries,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-court-finds-arrest-of-complainant-strange/articleshow/81560614.cms||Aamir Khan

---||Goa||Delayed due to pandemic, Parrikar memorial to be ready by September: CM||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday that work on the Manohar Parrikar memorial at Miramar will be completed within the next six months. “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, work on the memorial had slowed down. But within the next five to six months, the work will surely be completed. The instructions to this effect have been given to all the officials concerned of GSIDC,” he said after offering his respects at the site on the second death anniversary of the former Union defence minister. Sawant said that the BJP-led state government in Goa will be focused on human development, in keeping with Parrikar’s vision. “Even after two years of his passing, this government is running on the direction carved by Parrikar,” Sawant said. “His principle was to take everyone along. We will always feel the void left by him, but we are committed to taking forward his vision for Goa. He had always envisioned taking Goa forward on the parameters of infrastructure and human development. Moving in the same direction, our focus will also be human development.” Deputy CM Chandrakant Kavlekar, health minister Vishwajit Rane, WRD minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues, revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate, Parrikar’s son Utpal and BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade accompanied Sawant in offering tributes at the site where his last rites had been carried out. “Bhai (Parrikar) always strove to take all government scheme benefits to the last person in the state. We will strive for the same,” said Sawant, speaking later on Wednesday at an event to release a book on Parrikar’s life. Speaking at the same event, Sawant said that anyone coming out with any literature on a late person of the stature of Parrikar should be careful not to make allegations that the person is no longer able to clarify. “Many books are being written on Parrikar. A person who is not amongst us is not in a position to clarify his position, and so one has to be careful about what is being said,” said Sawant. BJP state office bearers led by Sawant, Tanavade and Panaji MLA Antanasio Monserrate also offered respects to the late former Goa CM at the BJP state headquarters in Panaji. “I am thinking of him today along with the rest of the state. His work for the state will always been remembered,” said Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/delayed-due-to-pandemic-parrikar-memorial-to-be-ready-by-sept-cm/articleshow/81558832.cms||---

The victim was affiliated to the United Taximen Union (UTU), and the four arrested are touts who operate private cars to ferry passengers from the airport. Police said that on Wednesday, around 35 persons including the touts gathered at the airport terminal building at around 4 pm, according to the UTU. When the cabbie, Guru Kambli, arrived to get his taxi from the parking lot, he was assaulted by the touts, said UTU member Prasad Prabhugaonkar. Kambli began bleeding from the nose and mouth, and was taken to sub-district hospital, Chicalim, and then to Goa Medical College, Bambolim. Around 300 agitated UTU members gathered outside Vasco police station demanding action. Soon, Dabolim airport police arrested four accused. The friction between cabbies and touts isn’t new. UTU has previously complained to police about touts doubling as taxi agents and taking away their business, following which there were verbal arguments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabbie-hurt-after-attack-by-touts/articleshow/81558868.cms||---

The petitioner Kamrunisha had challenged a case registered against her under IPC 306 (abetment to suicide) after the person with whom she had an alleged extra-marital affair killed himself. According to police, she was forcing her paramour to marry her. On January 17, 2020, she went to stay with him in his house and allegedly threatened to lodge an FIR against him and his family if he refused to marry her. She left after his family members intervened, but went back to his house on January 26 that year and allegedly repeated the threat. The man killed himself on January 28, 2020, and police registered an FIR against her. Kamrunisha moved high court. The HC judge said the woman had not said anything that could have led him to commit suicide. She had not hurt him in any manner, he said, adding that if she had threatened to lodge an FIR and was forcing him for marriage, he should have taken recourse to legal procedure rather than killing himself. The man committed suicide because of his circumstances and not because of her, the judge said, while ordering dismissal of the case against her pending in district court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/words-in-anger-cant-be-treated-as-abetment-to-suicide-says-hc/articleshow/81560643.cms||---

The pregnant bovine was grazing in the forested area at Nandrukiche Mal at Surla, when the attack took place. Locals say that the attack was by a male adult tiger who has already been reported roaming on the area bordering the Mhadei wildlife sanctuary in Goa and the reserve forest of Karnataka in Huland. This tiger was part of the pack of which four tigers were killed in January last year due to poisoning. Having survived, this male adult moved away from Golaulim last year into the forest of Karnataka, in higher altitude areas. The tiger has killed buffaloes and cattle in Huland over the last few months. More recently, it was found moving in the forest of the Mhadei sanctuary and forests of Karnataka. The family of Babu Bodke from Kankumbi had sighted the tiger on many occasions. The injured buffalo belonged to the family of Deu Pingale, 37, a resident of Surla. “In the morning, my buffalo was attacked and injured by the tiger. Due to the hue and cry by villagers, the tiger disappeared into the forest. When I informed forest officials, they immediately visited the spot and panchanama was done. Today a veterinary doctor also visited and saw the injuries caused to the buffalo,” said Pingale. Deputy conservator of forest, wildlife, Jebestin Arulraj, told TOI, “We have taken the family into confidence and started monitoring the tiger movements. Our staff is patrolling the area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pregnant-buffalo-injured-in-surla-forest-area-locals-say-tiger-attack/articleshow/81558905.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

In the last 24 hours, officials said, 536 people had tested positive for the viral infection while three more had succumbed to the disease. Delhi has recorded more than 6.4 lakh cases till date, the sixth highest in the country. The maximum of 23.7 lakh cases have been reported from Maharashtra, followed by Kerala (10.9 lakh), Karnataka (9.6 lakh), Andhra Pradesh (8.9 lakh) and TN (8.6 lakh). 5,736 cases in last 17 days, daily avg doubles since FebIn terms of fatalities, the city stands fourth with 10,948 fatalities. Maharashtra tops the list again with 53,080 deaths followed by Tamil Nadu (12,564) and Karnataka (12,407). The new Covid-19 cases came out of 80,856 tests — 50,216 RT-PCR and 30,640 rapid antigen — were conducted on Tuesday. The number of active cases rose to 2,702 from 2,488 a day ago, according to a bulletin issued by the state health department. While the first case of Covid-19 was recorded in Delhi on March 2 last year, the outbreak peaked about four months later with the city recording over 2,000 cases daily in June. The peak continued for nearly five months. In November last year, Delhi recorded nearly 6,000 new cases daily. However, the situation improved dramatically between December 2020, January 2021 and February with the city recording a few hundred cases daily. In February, Delhi recorded only about 140 cases daily. However, since March 1, daily cases have been on the rise. The city has recorded 5,736 new infections over the last 17 days, averaging a daily tally of around 337 cases which is more than double the number of cases recorded daily in February. The demand for beds has also gone up significantly over the past few weeks. On Wednesday, data shared by the government on the Delhi Corona app showed 756 out of 5,711 Covid-19 beds were occupied. The occupancy of ICU beds with ventilator and without ventilator support stood at 161 and 164, respectively. "There are around 1,438 Covid-19 patients under home isolation," officials said. "The trend is worrying indeed. Like Maharashtra, Delhi is also witnessing a resurgence in new cases. We need to act fast in putting in place containment and contact-tracing measures to prevent another potential crisis. Also, testing must remain high for timely detection and isolation of the positive cases," said a senior AIIMS doctor. He added that those at high risk of developing severe symptoms or death due to the infection should be vaccinated at the earliest. "The current rate of vaccination in the national capital is very slow," the doctor added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-delhi-covid-cases-top-500-in-a-day-for-1st-time-since-january/articleshow/81560651.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

On July 25, 2016, the special court had dismissed the complaint filed by Alam Pasha, an industrialist. He challenged the order before the HC. Allowing his petition, Justice John Michael Cunha quashed the order passed by the special court and directed it to proceed with trial. The case allegedly involving Yediyurappa refers to land in north Bengaluru taluk in an SEZ area. The Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board had acquired the land in 2006 and denotified it later. The key allegation is that the leaders misused their position and caused losses to the state exchequer through waiver of service charges and development fee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/setback-for-bsy-as-hc-junks-relief-in-land-case/articleshow/81560665.cms||---

The team was formed on Wednesday after the woman’s father alleged that she had been abducted. The woman’s whereabouts have not been known ever since a purported video of her surfaced earlier this month and Jarkiholi resigned as the water resources minister over the complaint. He denies wrongdoing and claims there is a conspiracy to damage his reputation. The state government has formed an SIT to probe various aspects of the case. The Belagavi police team is conducting separate inquiries into the family’s kidnapping claims. According to the source, the woman’s phone was first traced to Bengaluru and was last seen active in Delhi. There has been no activity since then. ACP Sadashiva Kattimani, who heads the Belagavi team, told TOI that it won’t visit Bengaluru as SIT officers were already conducting a search there. The team, which includes two inspector-level officers and eight constables, will instead focus on North Karnataka and try to identify people who possibly took the woman to Delhi.

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: 13-month-old in hospital after assault by 15-year-old nanny||GURUGRAM: A 15-year-old girl employed as a nanny by a couple for their one-year-old daughter has been detained by police for allegedly assaulting the toddler, who is on life support in hospital with four rib fractures and injuries in her pancreas, kidney, liver and spleen. One of the charges invoked against the nanny is Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code. The perpetrator is, however, also a victim. The police filed a second FIR against her employers under Section 75 (cruelty to a child) of the Juvenile Justice Act because the nanny is herself a minor and had been illegally employed by the family. Teen nanny snapped when baby fell accidentally: CopsThe nanny snapped, police said, when the baby “fell accidentally” and began crying, and she could not calm her down. In that state of mind, she allegedly kicked and punched the toddler, inflicting serious injuries. “The juvenile has been sent to an observation home in Faridabad. This is a very unfortunate incident and we are praying for the speedy recovery of the toddler,” said DCP (east) Maqsood Ahmed. The couple, who went to a market on Monday leaving their daughter with the nanny in their Sector 56 apartment, found her screaming in pain about an hour later. They took her to W Pratiksha Hospital from where they were referred to Artemis. Police said the teenager was employed three months ago. She was referred to by the cook, who has been working for the couple for the last two years. The cook and the nanny’s parents live in the same locality and were also neighbours back home in West Bengal. The girl was staying with her father and stepmother till she got the job. This was her first job. Had she been in school, she would have now been in Class IX. The toddler she was tasked with taking care of is 13 months old. Other than Section 307, the juvenile has been charged under sections 323 (causing hurt) and 325 (causing grievous hurt) and provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act following the toddler’s medical report, police said. The couple, according to police, has most of the house under CCTV coverage except the bedroom, where the nanny and the child were during the alleged assault. The father of the toddler told TOI on Wednesday, “We treated her well and never faced any problem. She never showed any anger and she took care of the child.” He added they would always take their daughter with them while stepping out and this was the one time they had let her in the house because she was sleeping. “Employing an underage person is in itself wrong. Giving responsibility to take care of a child to another child is not advisable, though it is common. Minors are not mature and mentally capable to take care of a child,” said Dr Preeti Singh, senior consultant, clinical psychology and psychotherapy, at Paras Hospital. Child labour is illegal and there can be no equivocation on this, said advocate Manish Shandilya, a member of the Gurugram bar association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurugram-13-month-old-in-hospital-after-assault-by-15-year-old-nanny/articleshow/81560674.cms||Bagish Jha
---||India||Rajasthan Cabinet will resign if ‘phone tapping’ can be proved: Minister||JAIPUR: Amid another round of bedlam in the assembly over the phone-tapping controversy, the Rajasthan government reiterated on Wednesday that the privacy of elected representatives was never breached during the political crisis triggered by Sachin Pilot’s revolt against CM Ashok Gehlot. Parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal said the entire Gehlot cabinet would resign if the allegation of phonetapping was proved, suggesting that BJP was flogging a dead horse simply to deflect from Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat’s alleged conspiracy to topple the Congress government in July 2020. Responding to the opposition’s statements during a zero hour discussion, Dhariwal recounted how the special operations group (SOG) of the state police “stumbled” on recorded evidence of the attempts to destabilise the Gehlot government while intercepting calls of arms smugglers. He said Vijay Kumar Rai, an inspector in the voice logger section of the SOG, reported a phone conversation about the alleged plan to “poach” Congress MLAs on July 10, 2020. Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi registered an FIR based on media reports and the anti-corruption bureau is still investigating the case, he said. Dhariwal alleged that contrary to what BJP had been trying to portray, it was the Union government that tapped the phones of “90,000 people”. BJP members rushed to the well of the House to demand a CBI inquiry into the allegation, twice leading to adjournments. The controversy got a new life after the state administration’s reply to a starred August 2020 question by BJP MLA Kalicharan Saraf belatedly appeared on the assembly portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rajasthan-cabinet-will-resign-if-phone-tapping-can-be-proved-minister/articleshow/81560672.cms||---
---||Nagpur||City police solve Nimgade murder case as ‘Rs5cr’ supari killing||Nagpur: The city police on Tuesday alerted Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) after unearthing the plot behind the murder of 72-year-old Eknath Nimgade in 2016. City cops alleged the Rs5 crore supari or contract killing was carried out by an interstate gang, including a sharpshooter from Uttar Pradesh. The city police crime branch has already rounded up nine out of 14 suspects for questioning. A scooter-borne suspect had pumped more than half dozen bullets into the senior citizen at Lal Imli Chowk. The case had been handed over to the CBI by the high court after a petition by his son Anupam, towards the end of 2016. However, even the premiere investigating agency had been unable to find a clue. Initially, Anupam had said his father was murdered by builder-politican nexus over a property dispute on Wardha road worth crores. Now, city police chief Amitesh Kumar has handed over to CBI a list of 14 suspects, including the alleged plotter Ranjeet Saphelkar, and also handed over some suspects to CBI team for questioning. The cops have, though, not revealed the motive yet. Kumar said it’s up to the CBI now to find out more details about the murder, including the motive and the mastermind who paid Rs5 crore to eliminate the senior citizen. “Around Rs1.75 crore had already changed hands for the murder,” said the CP. He attributed the detection to ‘increased flow of information’ after dedicated operations led to inquiries into around 11,000 criminals. The CP, who was flanked by Addl CP Sunil Phulari and DCP Gajanan Rajmane during a press conference, said Saphelkar had assigned Sharad Hate alias Kalu to plan the murder. Kalu had got in touch with Nawab Ashrafi alias Nabbu and Mushtaq Ashrafi to execute it. “Initially, Rs20 lakh were given to the executors but as there was no progress, Hate had roughed up Nabbu urging him to complete the ‘task’ as soon as possible. Nabbu and others had roped in Raja POP, Parvez and Baba for the final assault. These three had firearms with them. The plan was that Raja and Parvez would fire while Baba would stop Nimgade from escaping,” said the top cop, who has taken up several long pending murder cases. The CP said the executors had deployed men at various points between Kamal Chowk and Tehsil to relay the movements of Nimgade on the day of the murder. “City police team is now in north India to nab the other suspects, including Parvez from Uttar Pradesh,” he said. It’s learnt Raja was in Chhindwara jail after being arrested for a murder. He was brought to the city over his alleged role in a case of dacoity, and also interrogated in Nimgade murder case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-police-solve-nimgade-murder-case-as-rs5cr-supari-killing/articleshow/81556546.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Nagpur||Collector orders restarting MLA Hostel’s centre||Nagpur: Three months after it was handed back to the state PWD, the district collector has ordered restarting the Covid Care Care (CCC) at MLA Hostel which was shut in anticipation of the winter session of the state legislature last year. The MLA hostel, which was the first quarantine centre of the city, would add 320 beds to the overall CCC capacity of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). The other two centres at the VNIT Hostel and Pachpaoli police quarters are on and off running full because of the sudden spike in Covid cases in the last two weeks. The VNIT and Pachpaoli police quarters earlier offered over 600 beds each but now have only limited blocks available as the respective institutes have taken back possession of the rest of the buildings. Meanwhile, Rs127 crore was allocated from the district planning and mineral development fund for healthcare infrastructure. Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar on Wednesday ordered the administration to ensure sufficient oxygenated beds and human resource at private and public hospitals. In a press release, the district administration said additional oxygenated beds were being set up at government hospitals and the funds would be utilised for all arrangements for Covid patients. Amid the increasing caseload, government medical colleges have been frequently shifting step down patients to CCCs. Once the patients is stable, dedicated Covid hospitals send them to CCCs or advise home isolation. With 320 beds, MLA Hostel will be the biggest CCC in the city. Currently, Wing II and III of the hostel are occupied by guests and officials on tour. The hostel is likely to start admitting asypmtomatic patients in a couple of days. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said though MLA hostel has been requisitioned, there are sufficient beds at the VNIT and Pachpaoli CCCs. On Wednesday, Pachpaoli CCC too acquired more blocks having 390 beds but they make still take time to start admitting patients. The CCC has 160 patients in the only block it was left with. Increased contact tracing and mandatory quarantine of violators by civic teams led to more admissions at the CCC. VNIT has 120 beds while the civil surgeon’s data shows 59 patients have been admitted. Officials said families are being admitted due to which the occupancy keeps going up and down in a span of a few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/collector-orders-restarting-mla-hostels-centre/articleshow/81556582.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||India||TRP scam: ED attaches properties worth Rs 32cr of three TV channels||MUMBAI: Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached properties worth Rs 32 crore of three television channels in a money laundering case connected with the Television Rating Points (TRP) manipulation scam. The attached properties belong to Fakt Marathi, Box Cinema and Maha Movie channels and include land and commercial and residential units located in Mumbai, Indore, Delhi and Gurgaon, besides bank balance. ED may file its first chargesheet in the case against Fakt Marathi, Box Cinema and Maha Movies channels next week. The chargesheet may also mention all the other TV channels investigated in the case. The ED alleged the three channels had generated Rs 46 crore advertisements in the last couple of years using manipulated TRP. Officials stated two of these channels— Box Cinema and Maha Movie-—had generated 25% of their total TRP in Mumbai with the help of five houses where the barometers were installed. The third, Fakt Marathi, had generated 12 % of its total TRP from the same number of houses (with barometer). An official stated these compromised households would keep the specified channels on all the time, helping to boost their ratings. “The TRP was calculated on the basis of the total time period a particular channel had been watched, and not according to the number of households,” he said. Earlier, the ED had questioned a senior executive of India Today group in the case. The agency is probing the money laundering charges based on the Mumbai police FIR in the TRP fraud. The police have filed a chargesheet in the case and are carrying out further investigations. Police found involvement of six channels — Republic TV, Fakt Marathi, Box Cinema, News Nation, Maha Movie and Wow music channel in inflating viewership figures. Broadcasting Audience Research Council (BARC) had given a contract to Hansa Research group to install barometers in selected households and monitor them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/trp-scam-ed-attaches-properties-worth-rs-32cr-of-three-tv-channels/articleshow/81560675.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Mumbai||TRP case: Bombay HC asks state if it wants to continue probe against Arnab Goswami||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Wednesday asked the special public prosecutor in the Television Ratings Points (TRP) manipulation scam case if the state intends to continue its investigation against Arnab Goswami, editor-in-chief of Republic TV and ARG Outlier Media, which runs the channel. A bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale directed special public prosecutor (SPP) Shishir Hiray to inform the court by Thursday 11 am and deferred till then a plea by Goswami and the company seeking quashing of the FIR or transfer of the probe to CBI or another independent agency. Goswami has not been named as an accused with a “mala fide intention” to keep the probe open-ended to harass him, argued senior counsel Ashok Mundergi with Niranjan Mundergi, appearing for Goswami. He added there was no significant material against Goswami despite investigation by Mumbai police for over four months. Mundergi pointed to witnesses statements which he said were “clearly inadmissible”, but had been annexed to the chargesheet. “If the police have any material collected against him, let them show it,” said Mundergi. Hiray, countering Mundergi, said the police had a “strong case’’ and “sufficient evidence’’. He cited a report dated October 7, 2020, of Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) based on which the suspicion was formed. He said there were two reports of BARC, including an internal investigation, and both were in the chargesheet. He said the police are investigating the TRP scam case. Justice Shinde, who heads the bench, said to Hiray, “Take instructions if you want to investigate further. We want a statement. What are you going to do further?” Hiray, when asked by the HC, said senior counsel Kapil Sibal will appear for state. When Mundergi argued there is no case against Goswami despite two chargesheets. Justice Shinde asked him, “Do you want us to draw an inference that even after two chargesheets there is no sufficient material collected?” The judge asked the prosecution how long it wanted the investigation to continue. “This is like many cases we have seen ‘khichdi pakk rahi hai, but for how long?,’’ said Justice Shinde. “A person should be able to take a breath and it should not be like a sword hanging over someone’s head.” Mundergi said arrests cannot be made merely on suspicion with no material.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/trp-case-bombay-hc-asks-state-if-it-wants-to-continue-probe-against-arnab-goswami/articleshow/81560692.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||India||Probe political patronage for Sachin Waze, top cop, says Fadnavis||NEW DELHI: Citing details of the case of suspended Mumbai cop Sachin Waze planting explosives outside the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani and the suspected murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran, former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday demanded that the probe into the sensational plot should look at political patronage for Waze and sacked Mumbai police chief Parambir Singh. Asserting that the NIA should also take over the probe into the suspected murder of Hiran since it was linked to the plot to plant explosives outside Ambani’s residence, Fadnavis, leader of opposition in Maharashtra, said the probe should cover the role of senior politicians who got Waze reinstated even when the suspended API was being prosecuted for the alleged custodial death of terror suspect Khawaja Yunus. Fadnavis, whose sensational statement on the floor of Maharashtra assembly brought Waze under the scanner in the Antilia plot, said Waze and Parambir Singh were just pawns in a larger game, saying that he, as CM, was sought to be pressured into reinstating the controversial API. “There is an important question that why was API Sachin Waze reinstated? He was suspended in 2004. He applied for VRS in 2007. After that, his VRS was not accepted because there was an impending enquiry against him,” the BJP leader said and made scathing allegations against Shiv Sena, adding, “When I was CM in 2018, Shiv Sena had been pressurising us to reinstate API Sachin Waze. At that time, I reviewed his past record and decided that I would take the suggestion of the advocate general. I did seek his advice and the AG told me that Waze has been suspended and there is an enquiry by the high court in the matter, which is why reinstating him would not be right. That is when I decided against reinstating him,” the former Maharashtra CM said. Recalling that in 2008, Waze had joined Shiv Sena and worked as its spokesperson, Fadnavis said the arrested cop had business relations with active Shiv Sena leaders. “There should also be a probe about the motive behind his reinstatement. Was he brought back to extort people as he was given the most important role in the police department, only next to the police commissioner,” he added. Fadnavis said in 2020, when Sena took office, the government started making efforts to bring back Waze and made use of the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to bring him back. “It is interesting to note, only Waze and 2-3 other officers were reinstated and not others,” he said. “Therefore, there is a need to find out the political bosses at whose behest Waze was operating,” Fadnavis said and added that Waze and even Parambir Singh, who was shunted out a few minutes before the important briefing, could be pawns, who were being operated by the political bosses, who are still holding important portfolios.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/probe-political-patronage-for-sachin-waze-top-cop-says-fadnavis/articleshow/81560691.cms||---

On Wednesday, the party pledged a model Nandigram. In March 2016, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said their “first task” was to “resolve the Singur issue as quickly as possible”. “The landowners and farmers of Singur will get back their property and dignity — that is our foremost aim,” she had written in the manifesto. Six months later, the land was returned after the Supreme Court verdict. On Wednesday, the 2021 manifesto mentioned a ‘Model Nandigram’. “Nandigram will be developed into a model town, with better infrastructural facilities including well-connected roads, 24x7 affordable electricity and piped drinking water supply for all. Additionally, a new university will be constructed to provide greater access to higher education for the youth,” it read. The manifesto also mentioned that among the five separate health districts set up in Bengal, one was in Nandigram. Trinamool’s flagship health insurance scheme had found a mention in the 2016 manifesto. The scheme, which kicked off that year, has now re-emerged as a universal health insurance scheme. In fact, the party’s much-discussed programmes Kanyashree, Sabuj Sathi and Khadya Sathi find mention in the 2016 manifesto. All these programmes were later extended to beneficiaries beyond the targeted bloc. The 2016 manifesto spoke of Kanyashree Plus, which was later extended to high school and college-going girls. Sabuj Sathi has now been extended to all school students and is not limited to girls. The CM referred to the reason on Wednesday at a public meeting in West Midnapore. “In Ausgram (Burdwan), I was stopped by a school child. He asked me Didi why only girls get bicycles. I thought he was right and then we decided to extend this to all schoolchildren,” she said. Both manifestos lay thrust on industry. In 2016, it was said infrastructure of industrial parks at Panagarh, Goaltore, Vidyasagar and Haringhata would be improved. Private investment would be encouraged, it added. This doesn’t find a mention in 2021 manifesto. Similarly, the 2016 poll promises said: “Raghunathpur has been marked as a future industrial park location.” This did not find a mention on Wednesday. The 2016 manifesto had also said “we will ensure that the 100 days of work is expanded and that the people receive their wages in time”. Banerjee on Wednesday said Bengal had topped the country in the scheme. The 2016 poll promises also said “many lakhs of families would be provided with proper toilets. Places of congregation will also have thousands of toilets built. Our aim is to make Bengal a model state where open air toilets will be a memory. We will focus on the ‘House for All’ programme”. Over 82.6 lakh toilets have been constructed since. Bengal claims every block and gram panchayat is open defecation free. On Wednesday, the manifesto said 5 lakh additional low-cost housing would be built to reduce slum population from 7% to below 3.6%, and 25 lakh additional low-cost houses would be built to reduce kutcha houses to less than 1%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/trinamool-pledges-a-model-nandigram/articleshow/81559304.cms||---

Senior member of Art of Living and former DSP P N Singh said that the children aged between 12 to 18 undergo several physical, hormonal and emotional changes and the youngsters need to be guided so that they do not divert towards crime. He said Art of Living is running a special course for children in which they are taught ways of healthy living. “Once the children are involved in positive activities they are unlikely to get inclined towards crime,” he added. District Legal Service Authority (DLSA) secretary Abhishek Kumar said that they are focusing on around 100 children in conflict with law presently lodged in the observation homes. “A special course on farming and horticulture will be introduced in the observation homes. Regular programmes are also being held to educate the children about the adverse impact of committing crime. There is a need for changing the mindset of the inmates in the observation homes. Yoga courses are also being conducted to discipline their mind. The doctors from the Central Institute of Psychiatry have also been roped in to counsel the children,” he said. DLSA also holds quarterly meeting with stakeholders, including non-government organizations, to chalk out plan for the overall development of inmates in the observation homes. The organistaion is also interacting with people on the issue during its legal awareness camps in rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/stress-on-creating-awareness-to-prevent-children-from-committing-crime/articleshow/81556444.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||14 non-mineral based sectors focus areas of new industrial policy||RANCHI: Jharkhand government is targeting 14 non-mineral-based industrial sectors for fetching investments through the new Jharkhand Industrial and Investment Policy (JIPP) 2021. The JIPP, which aims to replace the existing state industrial policy of 2016, has listed textile and apparels, automobile, auto components and electric vehicles, agro-food processing and meat processing, pharmaceuticals, electronic systems and design manufacturing as high-priority sectors. Further, startups and incubation centres, healthcare, education, logistics and warehousing, tourism, IT and IT-enabled services, breweries and distilleries, renewable energy and light and medium engineering have been categorised as priority sectors. Besides fetching new investments across diverse sectors, JIPP will also focus on revival of sick industrial units in the state which come under the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) category. As per the state industry department’s estimations, there are 634 units that are ailing and on the verge of closure. In order to fetch investments, the JIPP proposes a 25% subsidy in the capital investment for MSME sectors in between Rs 1-5 crore. In case of large, mega and ultra-large projects, the capital investment subsidy will be up to Rs 30 crore. For MSMEs, there will be a 100% exemption of SGST for five years. For large and mega projects, the SGST exemption will be 100% for seven years. Units that have captive power generation units will have cent percent exemption on electricity duty for five years. For pharmaceutical companies, there will be capital investment subsidy up to Rs 30 crore while warehousing companies will have Rs 10 crore. Capital investment subsidies have been proposed for up to Rs 25 crores for new medical colleges, engineering colleges, private universities, new super specialty hospitals (minimum 150 beds) and hospitals with medical colleges with a minimum of 100 beds. “Mining and mineral sectors are our core strengths. So we are looking at other sectors that have scope to grow in the state,” industry secretary Puja Singhal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/14-non-mineral-based-sectors-focus-areas-of-new-industrial-policy/articleshow/81556483.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Soren, along with state health minister Banna Gupta, chief secretary Sukhdev Singh and health secretary K K Soan, attended the PM’s video-conferencing from Project Building. While the PM did not interact directly with Soren, the latter said Jharkhand too needs to maintain vigil in the wake of growing cases in the states like Maharashtra, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and a few others. Soren said the situation in most parts of Jharkhand is ‘under control’, but he is concerned about Ranchi and Jamshedpur. He said compared to other states, Jharkhand already has many curbs in place such as closure of schools for students up to Class VII, restrictions on gathering of 1,000-plus people and conduct of processions. “Covid situation in the entire state is very much under control and our focus now is to maintain the status quo to flatten the curve. However, Ranchi and Jamshedpur are the two areas where we are getting a bulk of daily cases. Of about 550 active cases in the state, Ranchi has around 330 while 80-90 are in Jamshedpur. It could be because many people come to these cities for work,” he said, stressing on the need to have some more stringent steps. While Soren did not elaborate on the measures, he appealed to the people to not let their guard down. “Covid is still not over. It is very much present amid us. While we are trying to increase the pace of vaccination, due precautions prescribed by the government must be taken,” he said, adding that vaccination drive is now being spread to panchayat levels to increase coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-concerned-over-covid-situation-in-ranchi-jamshedpur-hints-at-stringent-measures/articleshow/81556545.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Kolkata||Bengal: Coal cash lens on TMC leader, brother||KOLKATA: Vikas Mishra — the brother of Trinamool Congress leader Vinay Mishra — who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday, had allegedly stashed away nearly Rs 730 crore in connivance with Vinay. The ED, which arrested Vikas from New Delhi, has gone through statements of more than 40 people so far. Investigators, looking into the money laundering angle of the illegal coal mining case in Bengal, have reasons to believe that the Mishra brothers were hand in glove with prime accused Anup Majee. Majee, who allegedly used his political connections to continue illegal mining, paid the Mishra brothers who in turn forwarded the money to key links. Central agencies, including CBI and ED, have till now conducted searches on 49 premises. “We have gathered incriminating evidence in connection with the case,” an ED official said. Sources in ED said investigators, based on the evidence gathered so far, feel that Majee had mopped up Rs 1,300 crore through illegal mining. A major chunk of the money was allegedly given to the Mishra brothers. The two are also believed to be involved in the cross-border cattle racket, which the agencies are investigating. Majee and Vinay are still on the run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/coal-cash-lens-on-tmc-neta-bro/articleshow/81559385.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||Bengal elections 2021: BJP may field party heavyweights and more MPs||KOLKATA: Fielding some heavyweights — BJP office-bearers and MPs from Bengal — in the last four phases of the Bengal assembly polls came up in the BJP core committee meeting held at party president J P Nadda’s New Delhi home on Wednesday morning. This was hours ahead of BJP’s central election committee meeting at the party headquarters in the evening. Union home minister Amit Shah was present all through. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh and party’s national vice-president Mukul Roy were among the names floated in the core meeting, to strike a balance between veterans and newcomers because the party needed seniors to manage the BJP legislative party in the post-poll situation. Party leaders said there was no decision yet and any such news would be “guesstimates”. BJP sources, however, indicated that there was a proposal to field Mukul from Krishnagar Dakshin. While Trinamool Congress had won the constituency in 2011 and 2016 assembly polls, the party trailed in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls with BJP ahead by over 6,000 votes. Mukul loyalists hinted he was not willing to fight elections on health grounds. “His blood sugar level is high and he has trouble with his eyes too. But if the party wants him, he will certainly fight the election,” said a BJP leader close to Mukul. Ghosh would like to spend more time on campaign and organization instead of contesting from a particular seat. His presence is crucial not just for Kharagpur Sadar seat but for a couple of adjoining assembly seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-may-field-party-heavyweights-and-more-mps-in-bengal/articleshow/81559274.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||Bengal elections: Prime Minister Narendra Modi to hold 4 rallies in 10 days||KOLKATA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to address four rallies in Bengal over the next 10 days, three of which will be held before the first phase of the polls. BJP workers in Purulia have started preparing for a rally on Thursday. “Glad to be getting the opportunity to be among my sisters and brothers of West Bengal tomorrow, 18th March. I would be addressing a rally in Purulia. Across West Bengal, there is a desire for change. BJP’s agenda of good governance is striking a chord among the people,” Modi tweeted on Wednesday. The PM will be holding two meetings in Midnapore. He will address a rally at Kharagpur, West Midnapore, on March 20 and one at Kanthi, East Midnapore, on March 28. He will be in Bankura on March 21. BJP has already lined up rallies by star campaigners, including Union minister Amit Shah, in the Jangalmahal area. In Kharagpur, Shah had hinted at a meeting by the PM in support of BJP candidate Hiran Chatterjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pm-to-hold-4-bengal-rallies-in-10-days/articleshow/81559042.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal elections: Centre has not allowed state to vaccinate all, says Mamata Banerjee||LALGARH (WEST MIDNAPORE): Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday accused the Centre of sitting on the Bengal government’s pleas to vaccinate all. “A month back, before the elections, I had written to the Prime Minister. We want to vaccinate all people in Bengal at our own cost. Now Covid cases are also rising. But they have not allowed us,” Banerjee said and added that vaccination should be for all. The CM, who was addressing election rallies in West Midnapore, skipped a meeting, presided over by PM Narendra Modi, with chief ministers of different states on the recent surge in Covid cases in some parts of the country. Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay attended the meeting that happened through virtual mode. Bandyopadhyay, sources said, too raised the issue of the need for more vaccine doses in Bengal. “They speak lies. During Bihar polls, they had promised to vaccinate all people (there). It has been five months now. Have they done it? Before elections they will resort to lies and trickery,” Banerjee alleged. “We wanted the Bengal government to fund the mass vaccination drive in the state. But the state cannot buy vaccines on its own. It must be done by the Centre. They have not allowed us. And they have not given enough vaccines,” Banerjee further said. The Centre chose to dispute the claims, saying Bengal had been supplied with over 52.9 lakh vaccine doses, of which 30.8 lakh had been used. There is no shortage of Covid vaccine in the country, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said at a press conference in New Delhi when asked about CM Banerjee’s statement. The CM, however, had raised the issue of a pending Central nod to allow states to buy vaccines in bulk on their own. In West Midnapore’s formerly Maoist-hit belt, an emotional Banerjee, referring to the 2019 Lok Sabha results in which Trinamool Congress lost in these belts, said: “Mothers, can you tell me what my fault was? I had come here when none dared to come. I had stood with you when none did. If you want me back as the chief minister, then every vote you cast for Trinamool Congress matters. This is not a vote for Delhi, it is a vote for Bengal.” “This battle in Bengal will redefine politics in the country. You had believed in them and voted for them in 2019. What have they done since? Will you let them dictate your lives? Birbaha (Birbaha Hansda, TMC’s Jhargram candidate) is one of you. She makes us proud. And she will represent you, work for you,” Banerjee said. “Today they (BJP) have injured me. My head had been hurt, my hands had been broken; I had to undergo an operation in the abdomen,” the CM said. “CPM used to hit me before, now it’s BJP,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-centre-has-not-allowed-state-to-vaccinate-all-in-bengal/articleshow/81559076.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||---||Bengal elections 2021: Howrah rural SP removed after wife declared TMC candidate||KOLKATA: The Election Commission on Wednesday transferred Superintendent of Police (SP) of Howrah (Rural) Saumya Roy on the ground that his wife was a declared Trinamool Congress candidate from Sonarpur Dakshin assembly constituency in West Bengal. He has been replaced with Shrihari Pandey, an IPS officer from 2011 batch. In a letter to West Bengal chief secretary, the Commission said Roy’s transfer was based on the general principle that “close relatives of active public representatives may not be assigned such duties during elections, which may create any perception of biases/partiality”. EC ordered that Roy, an IPS officer, be shifted to a non-election post and that it be ensured that the officer does not leave his headquarters till completion of election for any political activity, as per the poll panel’s existing instruction. EC also requested the chief secretary to confirm that all senior officials connected with conduct of elections have given the certificate that they are not a close relative of any of the contesting candidates in West Bengal. “If there is any such case, it may be reported to the Commission immediately,” it stated. As per EC instructions dated January 23, 1998, in all cases where officers belonging to the IAS, IPS and other state government senior officials whose spouses were active in the political arena either as candidates in elections or as active members of political parties, “the concerned officers should not leave their headquarters either on leave or on tour till elections are complete in all respects”. If they, for some reason, must leave the headquarters, specific written permission of the chief secretary must be obtained beforehand. Also the chief secretary, while giving such permission, should ensure that such officers do not get involved in any way with the political activities of their spouses, directed EC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/howrah-rural-sp-removed/articleshow/81562053.cms||Bharti Jain

---||Kolkata||West Bengal elections 2021: If people allow, I’ll go to PM’s rally, says Sisir Adhikari||CONTAI: Trinamool Congress’ Contai MP Sisir Adhikari is likely to show up at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s public meeting in Contai on March 20. Sisir said chief minister Mamata Banerjee shifted from her home turf Bhowanipore to Nandigram to “finish off” his son Suvendu’s political career after he dumped Trinamool for BJP. Sisir, also Trinamool’s Purba Midnapore chairman, dropped broad hints on Wednesday that he was on his way out and might attend the PM’s rally.  “Who said I am in Trinamool? Do people say that? I and my family are being abused since December when my son Suvendu left Trinamool,” he said. “I have got a new name — Mirjafar, betrayer,” he continued. “We don’t know what out-of-turn benefits we got. People of Midnapore know whether we are self-seeking or have made some sacrifice.” “If you all give me a chance, I will go to the PM’s rally,” Sisir said on Wednesday while stepping out of his ‘Santikunj’ home here to get the second jab of Covid vaccine. Later in the day, Suvendu announced from Chandipur, near Nandigram, that he would request his father to attend the PM’s rally. The BJP leader further said he would take his father to Amit Shah’s rally if the Union home minister came to Nandigram before PM’s rally. While Suvendu was leaving in a car after having lunch on Wednesday at a house in Bheturia village, under Nandigram block II, a group of women armed with broomsticks came in the vehicle’s way. The Adhikari patriarch didn’t hide his angst against the Trinamool chief.  Answering a question on why Banerjee decided to contest from Nandigram, Sisir said: “She has jumped over to Nandigram. Her sole aim is to oust Suvendu, who has deserted Trinamool. She has come here following him (Suvendu).” The Trinamool veteran also appeared baffled by Banerjee’s leg injury, suffered in Nandigram’s Birulia village. “She got an injury. Doctors plastered her leg and discharged her within days. She is now moving in a wheelchair,” Sisir said. He had no comments on reopening of six cases related to the violence in Nandigram and Khejuri during the land stir in 2007. Sisir left it to the CM to tackle the matter, following the high court order.  “She will take the call. She is the administrative head-cum-Nandigram candidate. I pray she oversees the cases,” he said. The Contai MP felt “betrayed” because his demand for a deep sea port hadn’t materialised. “Shipping minister Mansukh Mandaviya had promised me about the port. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari came here yesterday. He processed the file way back in 2019 and placed it in the Cabinet. People here want jobs. Youths from farmer families, betel growers, fisherfolk want jobs,” Sisir said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/if-people-allow-ill-go-to-pms-rally-says-sisir/articleshow/81559178.cms||Suman Mandal
