---||Business||'Second wave' of Covid-19 infections impacting business normalisation: Nomura||MUMBAI: The 'second wave' of the pandemic is delaying business normalisation in the country, as coronavirus infections rise in Maharashtra and other states, a report by a Japanese brokerage said on Monday. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index dipped to 95.1 for the week to March 21 from 95.4 in the previous week as a result of the rising infections, the brokerage said. Covid-19 infections are rising to new heights across the country and many local governments have been forced to re-introduce stricter measures like night-time curfews and sealing off premises in order to contain the spread. “The pandemic's second wave is now spreading to states outside Maharashtra and is starting to impact mobility. This suggests a likely sequential dip in contact-based services and a near-term delay of normalization,” it said. The brokerage added that it expects the impact to be “more transitory and muted”, as factory operations remain uninterrupted, consumers and businesses have adapted to the new normal and medium-term tailwinds like vaccinations, global growth, easy financial conditions continue. It said as of mid-March, Google workplace and retail and recreation mobility fell by 3.7 percentage points on a week-on-week basis and 0.3 percentage points, respectively, while the more updated Apple driving index fell by 2.6 percentage points. However, power demand improved by 2.6 per cent week-on-week after a 0.6 per cent decline the prior week, while the labour participation rate inched up to 40.6 per cent from 39.5 per cent. The knock-on effect of the second wave on mobility suggests a likely sequential dip in contact-based services and a near-term delay of normalization, it said. The medium-term tailwinds from the lagged impact of easy financial conditions, fiscal activism, strong global growth and continuing vaccine momentum will support real GDP growth of 13.5 per cent in FY22, up from a contraction of 7.4 per cent in FY21, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/second-wave-of-covid-19-infections-impacting-business-normalisation-nomura/articleshow/81638932.cms||---

The NIA said the youth leader was a crucial player in sustaining the “political-separatist-terrorist” nexus in Jammu and Kashmir. Besides Para, the other two named in the chargesheet are Shaheen Ahmad Lone and Tafazul Hussain Parimoo, who were involved in gunrunning from across the Line of Control (LoC) for militants and channelising funds to sustaining terrorist activities at the behest of their handlers in Pakistan, an NIA spokesperson said. The NIA filed the supplementary chargesheet against the three accused under Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC, Sections 17, 18, 38, 39 and 40 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Section 25 (1AA) of the Arms Act and Section 6 of the Explosive Substances Act. Davinder Singh was arrested along with three others — Hizbul Mujahideen commanders Syed Naveed Mushtaq (alias ‘Naveed Babu’), the then district commander of Shopian and Ganderbal districts, and Rafi Ahmad Rather and advocate Irfan Shafi Mir — while they were travelling from Srinagar to Jammu near Qazigund in south Kashmir on January 11, 2020. Police filed an FIR was filed against the three. The NIA re-registered the case on January 17 and took over the investigation. It had already filed a chargesheet against eight accused in the same case on July 6. Parra, a close aide of former J&K chief minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, was arrested by the NIA in the case on November 25 last year. “The investigations revealed that chargesheeted accused Parra was part of the conspiracy for raising and transferring of terror funds to Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM) militants for procurement of terrorist hardware and was also a crucial player in sustaining political-separatist-terrorist nexus in J&K,” the spokesperson said. About Lone and Parimoo, the spokesperson said that the investigation has revealed that they were involved in gunrunning from across the LoC for the militants of terrorist organisations Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and were also channelizing funds to the militants for sustaining terrorist activities in J&K on instructions of their handlers in Pakistan. “Further investigations in the case are on,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nia-files-chargesheet-against-pdp-leader-waheed-para/articleshow/81639799.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Even though Quraishi said he offered an alternative ID document — his Aadhaar card — to complete the pre-voting identification formalities, the IIC election officers are said to have insisted on the smart ID card issued by the institution. The IIC management refuted Quraishi’s charge. When contacted, IIC secretary Kanwal Wali said, “All members were given two options to cast their vote, either electronically or physically, keeping in mind the coronavirus scare and that many of our members are outside India. After electronic voting was completed between March 10-14, a list of members who had not exercised the electronic voting option was drawn up and they were asked to cast their vote physically on March 21. This mail also went to Quraishi. When he came to cast his vote, he was neither carrying the smart card, for which he applied only on March 19, nor the old membership card, which too was acceptable proof of identity for casting his vote.” Wali added, “The returning officer requested him to bring the old membership card, as per procedure, and informed him that he would not be allowed to vote without it. At this point, Quraishi, who is a former CEC and well aware of the sanctity of procedure, agreed that due process must be followed.” The IIC held elections for one trustee and two members of the executive committee on Sunday. As per a retweet posted by Quraishi on his Twitter handle, the former CEC had applied for an IIC smart card earlier but was not provided a receipt for the application. Qureshi’s plea that even the Election Commission had a list of 13 ID cards that could be used by voters to identify themselves went unheeded by the returning officer. “Perhaps the IIC follows a more robust system than the EC, which conducts elections across the country,” Quraishi told TOI. The incident is said to have upset some IIC members, with one of them tweeting that they felt it amounted to callous disenfranchising of a senior member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-id-proof-ex-cec-cant-vote-in-iic-polls/articleshow/81639865.cms||---
---||India||Karnataka decides to extend quota beyond 50%||BENGALURU/NEW DELHI: The Karnataka government on Monday made a strong case in the Supreme Court for extending the quota in jobs and education beyond the stipulated 50% after making the move at a cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister BS Yediyurappa. On the notice issued by the SC, seeking its response whether the 1992 Indra Sawhney verdict given by a nine-judge bench needed to be re-examined, Karnataka said it should be the prerogative of the state government to decide on the quantum of quota. Monday’s cabinet decision to revise the quota cap comes a month after the Panchamasali Lingayat rally in Bengaluru triggered fresh calls on the need to take a relook at the reservation matrix within the SC/ST and OBC quota framework. Adhering to the recommendations made by the one-man committee of Justice Nagmohan Das, the Karnataka government favours suggesting a 2-percentage-point increase in reservation for SCs (15% to 17%) and STs (3% to 5%) communities. Besides, the demand of all OBC communities seeking a change in status would effectively take Karnataka’s reservation beyond 56%. The state government has fixed a list of criteria, including quantifiable data, inadequate representation, and case for administrative efficiency, to recommend any change in the reservation status. Apart from the 10% quota for the economically weaker sections of the society, Karnataka currently has seven categories of reservations — five for OBCs and one each for SCs and STs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/karnataka-decides-to-extend-quota-beyond-50/articleshow/81640110.cms||---
---||India||Parambir asks SC for CBI probe against Deshmukh||NEW DELHI: In what can spell more trouble for the beleaguered Anil Deshmukh, former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh on Monday moved the Supreme Court for a comprehensive CBI probe into the Maharashtra home minister’s numerous acts of alleged corruption and criminality. The controversial former chief of Mumbai Police also claimed that he was transferred out immediately after he briefed CM Uddhav Thackeray about Deshmukh’s allegedly nefarious activities. “The petitioner submits that unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair investigation is immediately required in the corrupt malpractices of Deshmukh before the evidence is destroyed,” 59-year-old Singh said in his writ petition filed directly in the SC under Article 32 of the Constitution, bypassing Bombay High Court, which he could have moved invoking Article 226 of the Constitution. Singh also sought a stay on his transfer to the home guard department and requested the SC to “direct the CBI to immediately take into its custody the CCTV footage from the residence of Deshmukh”. He termed his March 17 transfer order “politically motivated”. Singh challenged Deshmukh on his statement to the media that he was transferred to facilitate a fair probe into the explosive-laden vehicle found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence Antilia. He said it was a red herring drawn by the minister as there was not even a murmur that he had impeded probe into the sensational incident. Singh said Deshmukh was not only using junior policemen like Sachin Waze and Sanjay Patil for extorting money from various establishments in Mumbai, including dance bars, but was also taking bribes for transfers/postings of police personnel and regularly interfering in investigation of crimes by dictating the direction of the probe to policemen. He said he had “brought the corrupt practices of Deshmukh” in the knowledge of senior leaders and the chief minister. “Immediately thereafter, on March 17, an order was issued, by virtue of which the petitioner was transferred from the post of police commissioner of Mumbai to the home guard department in an arbitrary and illegal manner without the completion of the minimum fixed tenure of two years,” he said, adding that the transfer was in violation of the SC judgment mandating fixed tenure of minimum two years for top cops. The former Mumbai CP said Deshmukh’s baseless utterances about his transfer was to camouflage the minister’s own “misdeeds and malign” him. “The petitioner’s transfer in the aforesaid circumstances is for reasons smeared with malice, when there is no iota of material or evidence — far from proof — found or even imputed against the petitioner, and is solely based on conjectures, surmises and pure speculation, without detail of any sort against the petitioner having been noticed by anybody. Such transfer followed by adverse media publicity by Deshmukh is in violation of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India,” Singh said. “Having made such startling revelation, the petitioner is also apprehending further malicious and coercive actions against him at the instance of disgruntled home minister (Deshmukh) in abuse of his powers. While mechanically denying the contents of the letter dated March 20 submitted by the petitioner to the chief minister, Deshmukh has issued a press release threatening to initiate defamation proceedings against the petitioner,” Singh said and sought a direction from the SC to the Maharashtra government not to take any coercive action against him and order a CBI probe into all “criminal activities” of Deshmukh. Singh also gave the example of victimisation of another top police officer, Rashmi Shukla, who had intercepted telephone conversations about Deshmukh’s alleged corrupt practices. “It is reliably learnt that on or about August 24-25, 2020, one Rashmi Shukla, the commissioner intelligence, state intelligence department, had brought to the notice of the director general of police, who in turn brought it to the knowledge of the additional chief secretary, home department, about corrupt malpractices in postings/transfers by Deshmukh based on telephonic interception. She was shunted out rather than taking any firm action against Deshmukh. Further, Deshmukh had been interfering in various investigations and was instructing police officers to conduct the same in a particular manner as desired by him,” Singh alleged. “There were vertically five officers between the police commissioner and Sachin Waze, but the home minister was himself calling Waze to his residence, bypassing his seniors. It is clear that the transfer of the petitioner (Singh) is being done for motives above and beyond the purported reason of ‘bomb scare’ case,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/parambir-asks-sc-for-cbi-probe-against-deshmukh/articleshow/81640188.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The two will now have to submit financial bids after completing due diligence on the national carrier’s books, agreements and liabilities. In their financial bids, the parties have to state the quantum of AI’s debt they will be willing to take up and the upfront payment they will make for the asset. Whoever quotes the highest economic value for AI will be the winner of the bid. At least 15% of AI’s enterprise value has to be paid in cash and the balance can be taken as debt. AI has a debt of over Rs 90,000 crore. It is estimated that the national carrier would report a Rs 10,000 crore loss this fiscal.

Singh—who coined the famous “ab ki baar Modi sarkaar” slogan ahead of the 2014 general elections—or his spokesperson offered no comments on the report. Sources said that Tata Group has been wooing its Southeast Asian full-service carrier partner Singapore Airlines to come on board for the AI bid.

---||India||4 Lashkar terrorists killed in Kashmir||SRINAGAR: Four Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists were shot dead by security forces early on Monday after exchanging gunfire through the night in the Imam Sahib area of south Kashmir's Shopian. IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar termed the encounter a major counter-terrorism success that took the number of ultras killed in the Valley since January to 19, including two wanted commanders of different outfits. The slain terrorists were identified as Rayeed Ahmed, Amir Mir, Raqib Malik and Aftab Wani. Rayeed had been active in south Kashmir since October last year while the rest had picked up arms between November and February, the IGP said. A joint team of the Army, police and the CRPF had cordoned off the Imam Sahib neighbourhood on Sunday night after being tipped off about the terrorists being holed up in a house there. "As soon as the forces moved in, they were greeted with a volley of gunshots. Around 2am, we got some family members of the terrorists to make a surrender appeal, but they wouldn't listen. In the ensuing gunfight, all four were killed while a soldier was injured," Kumar said. It was initially suspected that the slain terrorists were from The Resistance Force, but the police later confirmed that they belonged to Lashkar. According to the IGP, security forces had killed five of the 18 local youths who had joined terror outfits this year. "Three more have been arrested. We are pursuing the rest, with the priority being to make them give up arms." Kumar said the standard operating procedure for encounters was being strictly followed by security agencies deployed in Kashmir. "In all encounters this year, no civilian was hurt. We lost four personnel, including a soldier, a cop in Budgam and two other policemen at Barzulla in Srinagar since January." General officer commanding (GOC) of the Victor Force, Rashim Bali, said the Army's 44 Rashtriya Rifles had reached out to the parents and wife of one of the terrorists in a bid to get him to surrender. The deceased's wife turned up with their four-year-old son, but it didn't make a difference. "It is because of this that the operation got delayed, otherwise it wouldn’t have lasted half an hour," the GOC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/4-lashkar-terrorists-killed-in-kashmir/articleshow/81640838.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||UP, MP sign Ken-Betwa river link pact||NEW DELHI: India’s first river interlinking project, connecting the Ken and Betwa rivers in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, is finally set to be implemented. After resolving their differences over sharing of water, the chief ministers of the two states, Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Yogi Adityanath, on Monday signed a tripartite agreement with the Centre in the virtual presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The revised deal will allow MP get additional water from the project, which will be implemented at an estimated cost of more than Rs 37,600 crore. The dispute between the states could be settled after UP agreed to drop its demand for a higher share. Even MP has had to compromise. The Centre did not agree to its demand to allow it to use the entire quantum of surplus water at the Daudhan dam site in the upper catchment area. The dam is one of the key components of the project. Though forest clearance for the Daudhan reservoir is awaited, the Centre will create a special purpose vehicle, the Ken-Betwa Link Project Authority, for implementation of the project in eight years and will bear 90% of the total cost. Speaking on the occasion, the PM said the agreement was important to realise former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s dream in the interest of millions of families in UP and MP. Noting that the project would benefit the entire Budelkhand region, he said rapid development was not possible without water security and management. He added that the vision of India’s development and self-reliance is dependent on water resources and connectivity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-mp-sign-ken-betwa-river-link-pact/articleshow/81640598.cms||---
---||India||Govt raises gap between Covishield shots to 4-8 weeks||NEW DELHI: The health ministry on Monday revised the interval between two doses of the Covishield vaccine to 4-8 weeks, from the existing 4-6 weeks, after evidence showed higher efficacy following a longer gap between the shots. The revised time interval between two doses is applicable only to Covishield and not to Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin vaccine. Increasing the interval between two doses is also likely to be an added advantage in covering more people as the AstraZeneca shot has been the mainstay of India’s vaccination drive. A longer window between shots can partly address concerns that vaccinations, despite the increase in sessions, are still not proceeding fast enough. The government could focus on ensuring that as many people as possible get the first shot with a longer time-frame for the second dose. In a letter to states and UTs, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, “Keeping the existing scientific evidence in view, it appears that protection is enhanced if the second dose of Covishield is administered between 6-8 weeks, but not later than stipulated period of 8 weeks.” The move is based on recommendation by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) and by National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) after reviewing the issue in accordance with the emerging scientific evidence. “During this meeting, the recommendation has been revised to provide second dose of Covishield at 4-8 weeks’ interval after the first dose, instead of earlier practised interval of 4-6 weeks,” the ministry said. The dosage interval of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII), has been under discussion recently. The World Health Organisation’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) had recommended an interval of 8 to 12 weeks between the doses in the light of observations that two-dose efficacy and immunogenicity increase with a longer interval. However, it also said that if the second dose is inadvertently administered less than 4 weeks after the first, it does not need to be repeated. In February, AstraZeneca had submitted clinical trials data of its vaccine, co-developed with Oxford University, after requests by various regulators and authorities across the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-raises-gap-between-covishield-shots-to-4-8-weeks/articleshow/81639176.cms||---

The 2019 Prize was conferred on Late Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said of Oman, while the 2020 Prize was conferred on ‘Bangabandhu’ Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the late founder of Bangladesh. The announcement comes days before PM Narendra Modi is scheduled to travel to Dhaka to be chief guest at the Mujib centenary celebrations. The year is also being celebrated as Mujib Barsho in both Bangladesh and India. In Dhaka, Modi will oversee a digital exhibition — Bangabandhu-Bapu Digital Exhibition, launched by him and Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina. Announcing the prize, Modi said, “The Gandhi Peace Prize 2019 being conferred on His Late Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said of Oman is a fitting recognition of His Majesty’s standing as a leader of remarkable compassion, and of his contributions to furthering peace and prosperity in the region.” According to a government readout, the selection procedure for the Gandhi Peace Prize did not allow it to be awarded posthumously but given the contribution of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman towards peace, non-violence and amelioration of human sufferings and special relationship with India, the exception was made as a special gesture to honour and celebrate them. The Gandhi Peace Prize is given for social, economic and political transformation through non-violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-makes-exception-to-give-mujib-the-gandhi-peace-prize/articleshow/81640909.cms||---

"Sticky bombs are, of course, a problem. But situation is not alarming. We will deal with it effectively and ensure a peaceful pilgrimage," IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar said in response to a question at a presser in Srinagar on Monday. In a recent advisory, the administration asked civilians not to leave their vehicles "unattended" in public places. This was after J&K Police seized an arms and ammunition consignment that contained IEDs with in-built magnets, enabling terrorists to stick them to any vehicle and detonate with a timer or remote. Similar explosives had been found in February along the international border in the Samba sector of Jammu. It turned out that the explosives had been airdropped by drones. Sticky bombs are being supplied to terrorists in the Valley through Pakistani's ISI to cause maximum damage with minimum risk, officials said. Magnetic IEDs had been commonly used by the Taliban to target US-led allied forces in war-ravaged Afghanistan. More recently, Islamic State has used them in Iraq and Syria. In India, sticky bombs were first employed by suspected Iranian terrorists in February 2012 to attack the wife of an Israeli diplomat. Kumar said the administration had decided on round-the-clock patrolling of Amarnath Yatra routes with 360-degree camera-fitted mobile bunker vehicles (MBVs) to combat all possibilities. "No vehicle carrying pilgrims will be allowed to mingle with other civilian traffic. There will be fixed timings for pilgrim transit on all routes."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sticky-bombs-cause-security-flutter-in-jk/articleshow/81641576.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||IIM-C director quits after clash with board||KOLKATA: Anju Seth, who broke the glass ceiling to become IIM-Calcutta’s first woman director, resigned from her position late on Sunday after locking horns with the institute’s board of governors over several months. Matters came to a head towards the end of February, when the board adopted a resolution against her at a special meeting and started an inquiry into her “conduct”. Seth’s term was to end in February 2022, when she would turn 65. She went on sick leave on Friday, leaving the institute in the hands of Prashant Mishra, the dean of external affairs. Besides sending her resignation letter to the board of governors, Seth mailed a copy to the PMO, sources said. An emergency meeting convened by the board on Monday was rescheduled to Tuesday. Seth, an alumnus of the institute’s 1978 batch, told TOI, “I’m disappointed as I’m leaving a dream only partially fulfilled; it is not what I had sought. Yet I’m proud that I tried my best and that I’ve disrupted the conventional barriers that were holding back the opportunity for IIM-Calcutta to emerge as a world-class institution. I hope that in the future, the institute will continue to build on a culture of transparency and accountability as core values. I have been privileged to work with many dedicated and talented people and wish them the very best for the future. I continue to be a proud alumna of IIM-Calcutta and shall always be.” In her resignation letter, Seth referred to the breakdown of confidence between her and the board after the latter chose to level allegations of wrongdoing against her without giving her a chance to defend herself, a source said. She also alleged lack of transparency and accountability, misuse of funds, instances of abdication of responsibility, weak financial health and governance issues that invited investigation by the Union education ministry and agencies like the Comptroller and Auditor General of India and the Central Vigilance Commission. Seth, who fell out with board chairperson Srikrishna Kulkarni, had apparently written to the education ministry, complaining of interference in her work. She said this was restricting her from taking the institute forward. The chairperson took exception to Seth’s letter and called a special meeting in February. The board also advertised for the post of a new director 11 months before Seth’s retirement, as opposed to the institute’s norm of initiating the process nine months before the incumbent’s tenure is to end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iim-c-director-quits-after-clash-with-board/articleshow/81641580.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Business||Government plan on content moderation 'legitimate scrutiny': Facebook India MD||NEW DELHI: American social media and messaging giant Facebook has termed the Indian government’s move to formulate policy and rules around content moderation “a legitimate scrutiny” and said that respect for Indian laws is “non-negotiable” as regulatory steps are initiated against hateful, violent, and unlawful messaging and posts. The company, that runs platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, seemed to be taking a conciliatory tone and said it will take action against unlawful content in line with its own ‘community standards’ and also as per Indian laws. “We are absolutely respectful of local laws. For me, it is not either-or. The fact that we respect local laws is a given, and is non-negotiable,” Ajit Mohan, MD of Facebook in India, told TOI in an interview in the company’s first official reaction after the government announced changes to the norms governing internet and digital companies through the IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021. Mohan said that Facebook and its group platforms are alive to the menace of inflammatory and unlawful content. “… we are constantly trying to raise the bar in terms of making sure that we address the concerns, including those we have heard from governments from around the world and India, on the kind of content that is on our platforms. We want to limit and eliminate content linked to violence, or content linked to hate speech, or content that calls for violence on the ground. Our agenda is aligned.” He said that platforms have to strike a balance between free speech and safety which is an “extremely complex issue”. “Both are important agendas for a company like ours, and a country like ours. We want to make sure that the canvas of free speech is as expansive as possible, including what is outlined in the Indian constitution. At the same time, there will be places where there are limits to that speech, for example when it comes to hate speech.” The government’s new IT rules, announced on February 25, mandate the social media and internet giants such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to disclose the source of unlawful and inflammatory messaging within 72 hours when asked by investigating and cyber security agencies. IT and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said that the measure was initiated to ensure that there is no “misuse and abuse” on the platforms, as the new rules also direct the companies to take down any ‘unlawful’ content on the request of the government, or the orders of a court, in a span of 36 hours. Mohan said, “It’s not in our interests for that kind of content to float around on our platforms. And we want to make sure that the internet remains a safe platform for doing business while still reducing or eliminating the minority of users and behaviours that violate local laws or violate community standards.” On whether the company will now come around on the government’s demands to provide the origins of an unlawful message (that WhatsApp has been steadfastly refusing in the name of end-to-end encryption and user privacy), he said the new rules are being studied at this moment. On the issue of paying news organisations for content , Mohan said that Facebook group companies already work with small and large news organisations in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-plan-on-content-moderation-legitimate-scrutiny-fb-india-md/articleshow/81641655.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||Kolkata||City steps into the future as 2 fuel stns stock up on CNG||Kolkata: The city on Monday took a small yet significant step towards improving the air quality by reducing emissions with the introduction of compressed natural gas (CNG) at two stations. Though the pipeline carrying CNG is held up in a land hurdle in North 24 Parganas, tankers commenced supply of the green fuel that is cleaner than both diesel and petrol. The additional transportation cost will make the fuel more expensive than in Delhi — against Rs 43.3 a kg there, it will cost Rs 67.6 per kg in Kolkata. But that is not expected to be a deterrent as it is still cheaper than petrol and diesel. Use of the fuel will lead to significant reduction in carbon monoxide (CO) emission, as well as relief from sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter that cause a plethora of respiratory diseases. Because of its high octane value, the fuel also enables better engine efficiency that translates to improved mileage. Compared to petrol vehicles, the operating cost could be half, said automobile engineering expert Prabir Bose. CNG’s only problem is NOx, which can be arrested by adding a catalytic converter with the engine. “In fuel characteristics, CNG is closer to petrol. This a simple conversion kit and can be retrofitted with the petrol engine to operate the vehicle on CNG. For diesel vehicles, the entire engine mechanism has to be changed,” Bose said. While adoption of CNG will take a while with auto companies now expected to offer CNG-powered vehicles in Kolkata and surrounding areas, the owner of the BPCL fuel pump in Garia that has stocked 8,000kg CNG is willing to wait and is confident that sales will be substantial in less than a year. “I don’t expect people to queue up for CNG initially. But, given the price difference, there will be a steady conversion that will drive growth. I have tied up with a kit manufacturer to enable a retrofit for Rs 42,000- Rs 45,000,” said fuel station owner Suresh Kumar Bajla. The CNG is being supplied by Bengal Gas Co (BGC), a joint venture between GAIL and Greater Calcutta Gas Corporation. The CNG will be sourced from Essar, which has been extracting coal bed methane (CBM) from Durgapur and Asansol. BGC can supply 3.5 lakh cubic metres of gas per day, which can be optimized to 10 lakh cubic metres per day. BGC will invest nearly Rs 7,000 crore to set up the gas grid in Kolkata and its adjoining areas and plans to set up 186 stations across the Kolkata Metropolitan Area. GAIL is building a pipeline connecting Panagarh to Kolkata and Haldia to provide uninterrupted supply of natural gas in a cost-effective manner. The matter is being heard in the National Green Tribunal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-steps-into-the-future-as-2-fuel-stns-stock-up-on-cng/articleshow/81638649.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

This is the second hike in airfare on domestic routes in just over a month due to the rising crude oil prices. Some airlines, however, said the Directorate General of Civil Aviation has so far not issued any notification regarding hike in airfare. A SpiceJet executive at Patna airport said in case of a hike in airfare, the airline’s headquarters will revise the base fare accordingly. “Station managers have no role to play in these matters,” the executive said, adding the number of flyers has steadily increased in all Patna-bound fights as air travel is the safest mode of transportation. Meanwhile, Adarsh Rajput, executive of a local tour and travel company, said flight bookings on Patna-Mumbai and Patna-Delhi routes have increased manifold in view of Holi festival. “A slight increase in base fare of different flights has been seen. The hike in airfare may force people to go for other modes of transportation,” he added. Another travel agent, Mukesh Singh, said, “The base fare on Patna-Delhi route was between Rs 2,000 and Rs 2,200 about a couple of days back. However, it has now increased to Rs 3,200. The jump in airfare is largely because of Holi.” Meanwhile, people who want to book flight tickets to visit home for Holi celebrations are in a dilemma due to further rise in airfare. “Airfares skyrocket during Holi every year. It hits frequent flyers the most. I travel to Delhi and Kolkata for business work every month,” said Manoj Singh, a city-based businessman. Nisha Jha, a resident of Punaichak, said, “I was planning to fly to Bengaluru in the first week of April as my employer has asked me to complete some paperwork. I have no other option but to book flight ticket despite the hike in fare as air travel is safer than other modes of transportation in times of pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/flyers-hit-as-govt-hikes-lower-fare-band-by-5/articleshow/81638477.cms||Faryal Rumi

The daily count of Covid, however, is still not scary in Bihar if compared to some other states witnessing second wave of the pandemic. As per the state health department, 90 new Covid-19 cases were registered on Monday against 43,844 samples tested. Hence, the positivity rate stood at 0.205%. However, a week back on March 15, Bihar had registered 26 positive cases against 33,047 samples tested and the positivity rate was 0.078%. The comparison between the two data shows 162.8% increase in the positivity rate. Nodal incharge for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna Dr Sanjeev Kumar said statistically the data is not very significant and numerically it is very small. “However, the data is practically significant. If the trend continues, there will be a significant increase in numbers too,” he added. The number of active cases in the state also increased from 327 on March 15 to 559 on Monday.

---||Business||Ultra rich root for private jet travel: Survey||Chennai: With Covid-related disruptions affecting international travel, India's high networth individuals are rooting for private air travel. A survey released by international property consultancy firm Knight Frank shows 43% of India’s ultra-wealthy travellers are more likely to consider private aviation going forward, 27% are less likely to opt for it, while 30% showed no change in preference. That's in line with the trend globally. Ultra-wealthy respondents from the United Arab Emirates (75%), Russia (71%), Nigeria (69%), Spain (60%), Canada (60%) and South Africa (60%) have all said they are more likely to use private aviation for travelling purposes, post-Covid.The preference for private jets comes alongside an overwhelming percentile of ultra high networth individuals saying that they would reduce both business and international travel overseas.The survey also said that 80% ultra high networth individuals in India are likely to reduce international travel for their business and/or leisure in 2021 while in the Asia Pacific 89% would reduce international business travel and 91% would reduce their trips abroad for leisure purposes.The fear of infection is one of the primary reasons for this segment to opt for private jet trips. “Due to the pandemic people have become more careful about their well being. We have seen a nine-fold rise in query out of which 70% were of first-time flyers. Most queries were for international travel from those who wanted to return back home. Soon after the easing of lockdowns, our major business drove from people wanting to go to Dubai and Male for vacations,” said Kanika Tekriwal, CEO & founder, JetSetGo Aviation.Indeed the increase in business has been sharp enough for some private charter operators to ramp up their fleet. “We have done 700-750 hours of flying both domestic and international in January-March. There are so many bookings every day we have to turn down 2 or 3. We are importing three more aircraft and they should join the fleet between April-June,” said Amba Shankar, director of Chennai based private jet start-up SBS Aviation. SBS, he said, is buying one 6-seater Embraer Phenom 300, one super luxury 13-seater Embraer Legacy 600/650 and a 10-seater Dassault Falcon 2000. Charter operators say the top destinations for overseas travel are Dubai and Male along with UK, far east and some African countries. With vaccination picking up speed this will also take off.“Private aviation though more expensive provide safety as well as flexibility and going forward as the vaccination programme develops in India and globally, private aviation will continue its niche status with the ultra wealthy in India,” said Shishir Baijal, CMD, Knight Frank India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ultra-rich-root-for-private-jet-travel-survey/articleshow/81639156.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

It aims at providing safe and adequate tap water to all households in rural India by 2024. According to the latest report of Jal Jeevan Mission of Union Ministry of Jal Shakti, Bihar has provided tap water connections to 67.03% of the total rural households in the state till February 27. Total 6.89 crore households across the country have got water supply connections since the launch of the scheme. The state demonstrates a substantial improvement in access to clean water in the last 18 months by providing tap water connections to 1,31,98,267 households, compared with 3,16,391 (2%) only as on August 15, 2019, according to the official dashboard. This represents an impressive over 50% jump in providing tap water in the last 18 months. The state has set the goal to provide drinking water to all the 1.96 crore rural households in 56,079 wards by 2024. The public health engineering department (PHED) officials said the number of households connected to tap water has been increasing per day. “Now, the state has covered 1.35 crore households by providing functional tap connections to over 3,18,720 more homes in the last 22 days. The number of households with tap water connections in Bihar is much higher than in other states and we would achieve the target of 1.96 crore households way before 2024,” an official said. PHED minister Ramprit Paswan on Monday said the latest figures of Har Ghar Nal scheme coverage are very encouraging and around 60% wards in Bihar have tap water supply. “To provide clean drinking water to the remaining households, we are constructing borewells and minars and restoring all wells and ponds for water accumulation under the Jal Sanchay scheme of CM’s Saat Nishchay 2.0,” he said. “In around 95% wards, we have developed new boring facilities and target it in the remaining wards within the next couple of months. Earlier, we had set the target to complete the work by March 31. Once, the boring is made, more houses will get water supply connections,” he added. Potable water supply to water quality-affected habitations is a top priority under the Jal Jeevan Mission. As per the latest National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-20), Bihar topped the list with 99% population having access to improved drinking water sources. Meanwhile, about 89% of the state households in urban areas are covered under water supply scheme, ensuring availability of drinking water in each household.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-on-top-in-tap-water-supply-to-rural-households/articleshow/81638637.cms||Faryal Rumi

Day temperatures in the city touched 37.4 degrees Centigrade with a real feel of 40 degrees Centigrade on Monday. Heat and humidity have increased rapidly in the last two days and authorities have asked the public to be cautious about rising temperatures. Its scorching and humid summer earned Vijayawada the name of ‘Blazewada’ during British rule. Day temperatures in peak summer average between 40 to 46 degrees Centigrade. But sudden climatic changes have impacted the weather this time and weather similar to that in May has come more than a month in advance. City roads remained empty in the afternoons. “It seems that we are going to face super summer this year. We have never experienced such a humid climate in March since 2017. It is better to avoid coming out of homes during the afternoon,” said Goundla Rama Krishna, an auto driver from Bavajipet. Andhra Pradesh Disaster Management Authority (APSDMA) predicts that temperatures will increase across coastal districts in the next five days and directed the district administrations to be prepared. The Vijaywada Municipal Corporation (VMC) has already started implementing its summer action plan. The civic body plans to open cool drinking water points across major junctions in the city. Voluntary organisations have started distributing buttermilk and other beverages. To prevent drinking water shortage, VMC is focusing on tail-end areas such as Jakkampudi, Kabela, Wynchipeta, Gunadala, Patamata, and Ajith Singh Nagar. Mayor Rayana Bhagya Lakshmi and VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh directed officials to restore 35 old borewells on canal bunds to meet emergencies. Temperatures in major cities on Monday stood at; Vijayawada 37.4 (maximum) and 22 (minimum), Vishakapatnam 34.1 (maximum and 22 (minimum), Guntur 36.2 (maximum) and 21 (minimum), and Tirupati 39.5 (maximum) and 19 (minimum).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vij-streets-empty-out-as-super-summer-hits-city-early/articleshow/81638139.cms||Venu Lanka

The party has also included Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021 as one of the agendas for the march. Leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Monday tweeted that he would encircle Vidhan Sabha with his party members on Tuesday. “Don’t stop, don’t hold on or bend in front of autocratic government (sic),” he tweeted. As per the schedule prepared by the RJD, the march will begin from JP roundabout near Gandhi Maidan and reach Income-Tax roundabout via Dak Bungalow crossing. From Income-Tax roundabout, the march will move towards R Block and then to Vidhan Sabha. Though RJD had written to the district administration seeking permission to hold the march, its request was turned down on various grounds, including a high court order in which Gardanibagh protest site was earmarked for such purposes. Sohaib said the party would cooperate with the police during the march.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/50000-to-participate-in-march-today-rjd/articleshow/81638288.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The new process would maintain a middle path between the two entities. Sebi said that, till March 31, 2022, these bonds will be valued at 10-year residual maturity, between April and September 2022 at 20-year residual maturity, between October 2022 and March 2023 at 30-year residual maturity and thereafter (in effect, from fiscal 2023-24) at 100-year residual maturity. On March 10, Sebi had come out with a circular to value AT1 bonds, which are also called perpetual bonds, with 100-year maturity from the day of issue. Several banks issue these bonds with mutual funds (MFs) being one of the biggest buyers of these instruments. As a result, the Sebi circular was seen as limiting fund houses’ appetite for these bonds. Since such a situation would have been detrimental to the interest of banks which issue these bonds, the DFS had asked Sebi to reconsider its circular. The fresh Sebi circular issued on Monday was aimed at controlling the damage. According to a top fund manager, the latest Sebi circular is better than valuing AT1 bonds at 100 years to maturity from April 1, 2021 itself, which was specified in the March 10 circular. The current circular gives a softer ‘glide path’ to AT1 bonds. Additionally, Sebi’s decision that secondary market prices will be used for valuation, and if these bonds are not traded then 10-year maturity should be taken for valuation, would help stabilise the market price of these bonds. Some of the large fund houses have substantial exposure to these bonds and were “a bit worried with the earlier Sebi circular…now there is some relief for those fund houses”, the fund manager said. The earlier Sebi circular was aimed at protecting the interest of investors after the RBI had cancelled AT1 bonds during Yes Bank’s reorganisation process and during the forced merger of Lakshmi Vilas Bank with DBS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/at1-bond-valuation-gets-softer-glide-path/articleshow/81639592.cms||---

Rao, who created a stir by leaving behind a note in which he stated he would end his life against the Centre’s proposal to privatise the steel plant, went missing early Saturday morning. Since his disappearance, police have received complaints, alleging that Rao collected funds to the tune of Rs 2 crore from unemployed youngsters by promising them jobs in various government organisations. The police investigation has revealed that Rao worked as a foreman in the WRM unit of VSP and had attended the night shift on Friday. At 6.30am on Saturday, he made an entry of leaving the WRM unit in the attendance sheet. He left his phone, wallet and other items behind in the plant and wrote the suicide note and left in the logbook of the WRM unit. A senior police officer said their investigation has also revealed that Rao had collected more than Rs 2 crore from youngsters by promising them employment in VSP and other public sector units (PSUs). A day after these irregularities were exposed, more youngsters claiming that Rao duped them approached the police to lodge complaints, he added. It has also emerged that Rao had been leading a lavish lifestyle, indicating he may have indulged in irregularities. The police are also verifying Rao’s bank statements as some youngsters claimed they had deposited money in Rao’s account. Meanwhile, despite extensive searches, Srinivasa Rao is yet to be traced. Police are also examining Rao’s call data. The missing employee had left behind a suicide note on Saturday morning, in which he stated he was about to end his life in protest against the move to privatise VSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/missing-vsp-staffer-collected-rs-2-cr-over-false-job-promises/articleshow/81637991.cms||---

Rain spells in March are rare in the city. ” Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD, Pune, told TOI, “Interaction between different winds, especially over north central Madhya Maharashtra, including Pune district/city, has been resulting in local instability/thundery activity and clouding. The interaction is also one of the reasons for the partly or generally cloudy skies from time to time. Such spells may continue over parts of Pune till March 24.” The IMD on Monday forecast thunderstorms and lightning at isolated places over parts of Central and West India during the next three days. Isolated hailstorms were also forecast over parts of Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Madhya Maharashtra and Marathawada till March 23-24.

Inaugurating the first-ever Bihar Museum Biennale in a hybrid mode -- physical and digital -- on the occasion of Bihar Diwas celebrations here, the CM said school students must visit the museums to know about the civilization and the history of mankind. A visit to the Bihar museum, the only museum of international standards in India, will make them aware of the glorious history of the state, he said. Both the old Patna Museum and the Bihar Museum were priceless treasure houses of art and artefacts. He said both the museums would be soon linked to each other through a subway. A person who visits Patna Museum would also be entitled to visit Bihar Museum that day, he said. The Biennale features a series of masterclasses with leading experts from the creative industries and a two-day international conference with eminent speakers like Neil MacGregor, Hilary Knight, Sourana Noujaim, Javier Barón Thaidigsmann among others. It showcases exhibitions from several international museums as well as from 13 Indian museums, including the host Bihar Museum. Speakers and participants from Germany, France, India, Italy, Spain, Singapore, South Africa, the UK, and the UAE are expected to attend the Biennale. Nitish pointed out that he had first visited the Patna Museum as a student and then as a chief minister and found that things were not displayed properly. “A large number of findings of historical importance were virtually dumped in a limited space and, hence, I thought of constructing another museum of international standards. Even PM Narendra Modi found time to visit this museum on October 14, 2017 and appreciated its rich collections,” he said. Nitish reiterated that even the Patna Museum was being developed into a modern museum with a number of new galleries. The Rahul Sankrityayan gallery would house all the valuable manuscripts brought by the great scholar from Tibet. All these rare manuscripts would be translated into modern languages so that the younger generation could take advantage of the knowledge preserved in these texts. Besides, it would house a Rajendra Prasad gallery in the memory of the first President of India and a natural history gallery containing million years old plant fossils. Bihar Museum’s nodal officer Anjani Kumar Singh welcomed the participants and traced the history of its development. Deputy chief ministers Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary and art, culture and youth department minister Alok Ranjan also spoke on the occasion. Mumbai-based Chhatrapati Shivaji Museum’s director general Sabyasachi Mukherjee and France’s ambassador to India, Emmanuel Lenain, joined the function through virtual platform. Bihar Museum Biennale’s special edition coffee-table book, ‘Bihar, India and the World: Celebrating Museum Collections’, featuring landmark collections of the participating national museums was also launched on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/youngsters-should-visit-museums-to-study-cultural-heritage-of-bihar-nitish/articleshow/81639001.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Patna to get plastic waste processing unit||PATNA: A waste processing unit for getting rid of tonnes of plastic products generated from houses will soon be set up by the Central Institute of Petrochemicals Engineering and Technology (CIPET) in the state capital, funds for which will be given by the Centre. Three other cities selected for the project under the 15th Finance Commission include Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Varanasi. The Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to give a 5-acre land at the landfill site in Ramachak Bairiya village on the Patna-Gaya Road for developing the plastic waste processing unit. The empowered committee members of the civic body had given their nod to the site recently and a team of CIPET officials visited the area about a week ago. While the PMC will bear the cost of construction of the unit, the CIPET will provide the required machinery and other equipment for recycling and disposing of plastic waste. City manager of the PMC, Arvind Kumar, told this newspaper that the civic body would select a private firm for developing the infrastructure of the waste processing unit on the earmarked land. “The CIPET will operate the unit for the next seven months once it is ready and impart training to the sanitary inspectors and workers so that they can use it later,” Arvind added. According to sources, plastic waste will be collected, sorted, shredded, washed, melted, and pelletized to get granules. Separate machines will be installed for crushing plastic products and processing them. “The processing unit will meet the huge demand of granules that are used in constructing roads or making furniture in the state,” said Arvind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-to-get-plastic-waste-processing-unit/articleshow/81638371.cms||Faryal Rumi

The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar directed the HC registry on Monday to file 35 separate writ petitions for each of the ongoing projects to begin their monitoring. The bench has fixed March 25 as the next date of hearing. The state government would have to file its reply regarding all districts via which all national highways in these 35 projects pass through. The NHAI would have to simultaneously reply on the position of land acquisition and possession, work allotment and timeframe for completion of projects. The bench has directed additional advocate general Anjani Kumar, along with assisting counsel Alok Kumar Rahi, to appear in all 35 suo motu writ petitions for the state government for their key role in helping the HC in the past, along with the Centre’s additional solicitor general KN Singh and senior counsel SD Sanjay for the NHAI. During Monday’s hearing, NHAI submitted a table of all 43 NH projects in Bihar to HC. Out of these, the court is already monitoring five. The NHAI informed the HC that the Chhapra-Muzaffarpur section of NH-102, Muzaffarpur-Sonbarsa section of NH-77 and Biharsharif-Mokama section of NH-82 are complete. It all began with a PIL filed by social organization Pratijnya in 2019, urging the HC to direct the authorities concerned to complete the Patna-Gaya-Dobhi section of the NH-83 pending for years due to delay by the contractor and land acquisition issue. HC later passed a series of orders directing the stakeholders, including the state government, the NHAI and the DMs of Patna, Jenahabad and Gaya, to hold meetings and take action after which the project picked up speed. During the hearing of this case, the HC also took details of all NH construction projects in the state. The HC later also started monitoring the Hajipur-Muzaffarpur section of NH-77, Varanasi-Aurangabad and Aurangabad-Chorhada sections of NH-2. Recently, the Chief Justice went to Bhagalpur to inaugurate a court complex and observed the poor condition of the Munger-Mirza Chowki section of the NH-80 after which a suo motu cognizance was taken in March this year leading to the start of monitoring of this project too. The HC on Monday ordered the development commissioner to convene a meeting of the stakeholders and file a personal affidavit on the status of land acquisition and maintenance for the NH-80 project. For NH-2, the HC ordered that the contractor concerned be made a party to the case as he was delaying the project and not taking part in the meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-to-monitor-all-nh-road-projects-in-bihar/articleshow/81638546.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Reports reaching the police headquarters said Rajesh Rai (40) stabbed to death his wife Ramkali Devi (35) at Basaw Tola Nagri village under Basantpur police station in Siwan district late on Sunday night. Later, Rai committed suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling of his house. The incident came to light when some residents visited Rai's house on Monday morning and reported the matter to the police. The couple has four children in the age group of four to 12 years. The SHO of Basantpur police station Ashutosh Kumar said a domestic dispute is stated to be the reason. Rai used to quarrel with his wife over family issues, which led to the incident, he added. The police said Rai used to eke out a livelihood selling vegetables in the local market. Financial constraints often led to heated arguments between the husband and the wife. "The bodies were handed over to the relatives after post mortem," an investigating officer said. In Muzaffarpur, the police recovered the bullet-riddled body of Abdul Kuddus from Rampur Kashi village on Muzaffarpur-Mahua road under Maniari police station on Monday morning. The deceased, a resident of Majhia village under Chehrakalan block in Vaishali district, was employed at the sub-registry office in Muzaffarpur. The family members were searching for him when he didn't reach home from the office on Sunday. The man's maternal uncle, Tanveer Alam, said the identity of the victim was ascertained by the identity card recovered from his pocket. "He was killed somewhere else while returning home from his office and his body was dumped on the spot," he added. On getting information, Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant visited Maniari police station and issued instructions to arrest the culprits at the earliest. This is the second incident of murder in Muzaffarpur within 24 hours. Earlier, a trader identified as Vinod Choudhary was shot dead near Sherpur under the Ahiapur police station area when he was returning home after closing his shop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/siwan-man-kills-wife-commits-suicide/articleshow/81638500.cms||Ramashankar

Singh said the university’s first goal is to harvest water on its campus and the second is to raise awareness among people living in nearby rural areas about water harvesting. “Decentralised water treatment systems are also being effectively implemented on the campus. The idea is to make 80% of the used water re-useable. The water is conserved in Kamal Sagar, a cluster of four ponds built on the campus,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/water-conservation-top-priority-of-nu/articleshow/81638557.cms||---
---||Patna||Do not pollute air by burning plastic items on eve of Holi: Bihar pollution control board||PATNA: The Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) has appealed to residents not to burn polluting items made of plastic and non-combustible material in Holika dahan, a traditional bonfire on the eve of Holi, that is on March 29. Heaps of garbage consisting plastic bags, bottles, rubber sheets, leather products and other toxic waste are seen all over the city ahead of Holika dahan. When burnt, these items release toxic fumes that are dangerous for human bodies if inhaled. BSPCB chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh on Monday said conventional methods of street plays, dance, radio and print messaging among other things are being used to reach out to the public for creating awareness. “We have hired three teams to perform 'nukad nataks’ across the city over the next four days. For spreading awareness in remote areas, we have composed radio jingles to be aired from all the AIR stations during regional news hours at 7.30pm till March 28,” Ghosh said. Surrender Singh, an environmentalist and director (ecology) of environment, forest and climate change department, said the past year has taught everyone the importance of staying healthy. “People should acknowledge that air pollution is hazardous for human health and its effects can be long lasting. Adopting safer means of celebration is important,” he said. Acharya Dinesh Pandey cited scriptures, which mention that only dried leaves, twigs, branches of seven specific trees and cow dung cakes can be used in Holika. “Holika, if done in proper way, imparts divine energy to the atmosphere,” he said. Pledging to keep the environment clean, some residents of the city are adopting eco-friendly practices to champion the ‘good over evil’ concept of lighting the bonfire. Soumya Chaudhary, president of an apartment society on Boring Road, said, “We make an inverted cone-shaped structure, decorate it with ferry lights and keep a symbolic earthen lamp in the centre. All of the rituals are performed around this structure. This way both the religious and environmental aspects of the festival are catered to.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dont-burn-polluting-items-on-holi-eve-bspcb/articleshow/81638951.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Aspiring cop rigs mask with cellphone parts in exam||PATNA: In these Covid times, face masks are a lifesaver. They are used as a fashion accessory now, and some even use them to make a social or political statement. But a 19-year-old aspiring police constable tipped the innovation scale further by turning an N95 mask into a potential tool for cheating in a recruitment exam in Vaishali. The examinee, Vishal Kumar, a resident of neighbouring district Saran, came prepared for the exam. The mask had parts of a dismantled mobile phone and a blue tooth device sewn in. Vishal had a smooth entry as Covid rules allow the wearing of a mask during an examination. Wearing his rigged face mask, he was allotted a seat in room number 16 of the examination centre at the Panapur Dharmapur Secondary School centre on Sunday. But soon, his luck ran out. Two invigilators—Ashutosh Kumar and Md Mumtaz—spotted him talking in a hushed tone and then writing down answers on the answer sheet. "He could talk in a hushed tone as other examinees were sitting at a safe distance due to Covid19 guidelines. But we got suspicious and asked him to remove his face mark and were taken aback to see electronic devices hidden inside the face mask," one of the invigilators Ashutosh said. Centre superintendent Chattu Yadav said, "The parts of a mobile phone, including a sim card and battery, were hidden in the mask near his mouth and ear in such a manner that nobody could suspect anything. It was because of this that the examinee could enter despite strict checking and verification of documents." The examinee was arrested, and the electronic devices were seized, police said. During interrogation, Vishal disclosed that the parts of a mobile phone were separated and then connected with the circuit after removing the case. The electronic parts stitched into the face mask were connected to a blue tooth device with a wire, which itself was hidden with a thin string to support the mask. "Vishal has been booked under various sections of the IPC and IT Act. An FIR was lodged based on a statement of centre superintendent Chhatu Yadav," Bidupur police station SHO Dhananjay Kumar Pandey said. Authoritative sources said the mastermind of the racket was sitting at a distance from the examination centre and helping the candidate solve the questions over the phone. Vishal was not the only one, in Kaimur, police arrested two others—Vicky Kumar and Niranjan Kumar—from two different examination centres and seized electronic devices fitted in sN95 face masks. Later, three members of the cheating racket, Santosh, Dipak and Atul Pal, were nabbed, and a printer, laptop, mobile phones and books were seized. The written test was conducted at 498 centres across the state on Sunday. The central selection board of constables (CSBC) is examining 8,415 posts of constables.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aspiring-cop-rigs-mask-with-cellphone-parts-to-cheat-in-exam-held/articleshow/81638323.cms||Ramashankar
---||Business||RBI moves a step closer to issuing new bank licences||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has set up a standing external advisory committee (SEAC) headed by former deputy governor Shyamala Gopinath to evaluate on-tap applications for universal and small finance banks. Although the guidelines for on-tap licensing were announced as early as 2016, the central bank had said that the applications would need to be scrutinised by a standing committee, which has been appointed only now. Changes to the 2016 guidelines were proposed by an internal group that had said that non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) floated by corporates could be given licences. With the SEAC in place, the RBI appears to be sending out a message that it is finally ready to look at new applications. Besides the chairperson, the other four members are RBI central board director Revathy Iyer, NPCI chairman B Mahapatra, Canara Bank’s former chairman T N Manoharan, and SBI’s former MD & PFRDA’s former chairman Hemant Contractor. While announcing the guidelines for ‘on-tap licensing of universal banks’ in 2016, the RBI had indicated that applications will be initially screened by the central bank to ensure ‘prima facie eligibility of the applicants’. It was also stated that an SEAC will evaluate the applications thereafter and that the constitution of this committee will be announced by the RBI. The constitution of an SEAC was also mentioned in the RBI guidelines for ‘on-tap licensing of small finance banks’. There has been fresh debate over the issue of new licences after the RBI’s internal working group reviewing the corporate structure of private banks said that NBFCs owned by corporates should be allowed to set up banks. Many saw this as an opening up of the doors for corporates to get into the banking sector. However, former central bankers pointed out that there has been a harmonisation of guidelines for banks and large NBFCs. This meant that large NBFCs are going to be more intensely regulated. Since the on-tap guidelines were announced, only one entity — UAE Exchange — had shown interest in applying for a bank licence. Since then, the group promoted by UAE entrepreneur B R Shetty has fallen in troubled times and the financial services business sold. Around a decade ago, when the RBI invited applications for bank licences, there were 24 applicants including the Tatas, Aditya Birla Group, Reliance ADAG, and Bajaj Finserv. The Tatas dropped out of the race after the group realised that the central bank would need to look at nearly 1,000 of its companies as part of the due diligence process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-moves-a-step-closer-to-issuing-new-bank-licences/articleshow/81639626.cms||---

The e-buses plying from Gandhi Maidan to Patna airport and Danapur since March 2 have received good response as over 19,000 people have availed the facility in the last 20 days. The BSRTC is running four buses from Bankipore bus depot near Gandhi Maidan to Danapur via Bailey Road (route number 111A) and two buses from Gandhi Maidan to Patna airport (route number 100). According to BSRTC officials, average 800 to 900 passengers have travelled in the buses daily. BSRTC administrator Shyam Kishore said the fare chart was being worked out for the new routes. “A meeting to roll out more e-buses will be held on Tuesday (March 23). The department has planned to start e-buses on all city routes,” he said. The department has also planned e-buses to Rajgir and Muzaffarrpur after setting up charging points at the bus depots there. In Patna, the charging station of 1,200kW capacity is there at the upcoming Transport Complex in Phulwarisharif. Sharing her experience, collegian Jyotsna Singh said, “The airconditioned buses are pollution-free and provide comfortable ride at affordable rate. I pay Rs20 from Gandhi Maidan to the college. Nowadays, autorickshaws also charge Rs12.” Vikas Kumar said people prefers comfortable public transport in summer and e-buses are boon for the residents. “As four buses are running on Danapur route, I do not have to wait for more than 15-20 minutes. And that is worth it to pay just Rs50 compared to Rs300 charged by a cab,” he said. The 45-seat buses are equipped with panic button, mobile charging points, CCTV cameras, public address system, speed governor and fire safety device.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/transport-department-set-to-introduce-more-e-buses-in-state/articleshow/81638439.cms||Faryal Rumi

Though the NMC headquarters has not been sealed, the civic administration has imposed restrictions on visitors’ entry. The NMC has started conducting RT-PCR tests of its employees in the headquarters and the six divisional offices in the city as they come in contact with a large number of people for various works and services. So far, 14 employees in the headquarters have tested positive. NMC’s medical superintendent Bapusaheb Nagargoje said all the employees who have tested positive are asymptomatic. “They are isolating at home and are in stable health condition,” he said. Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav has banned the entry of visitors into the headquarters without prior appointment. Moreover, not more than three people are allowed to enter the office buildings at a time. The city has reported a sharp rise in the number of Covid-19 cases over the past few days. In the first week of February, the city was recording only 99 cases per day on average. By the first week of March, the number had increased to 266. With the rise in the number of new cases, the NMC has taken several measures including increasing contact tracing and testing of people with symptoms for early detection and immediate treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/14-employees-at-nashik-civic-bodys-hq-tests-ve/articleshow/81636960.cms||Tushar Pawar

According to Pedana police, the accused who is yet to be identified claimed to be deputy superintendent of police Sarath Kumar at the bureau. Cops said the accused had allegedly duped the brother of the complainant, assistant engineer of panchayat raj Batchu Prasad, who was caught in an ACB trap case, claiming to help him with the case proceedings. The fake ACB official demanded Rs 3 lakh and took Rs 1 lakh as an advance. Soon after, he switched off his mobile phone. Prasad was caught recently for demanding and accepting a bribe from a contractor for carrying out an official favour. Cops said Batchu Prasad held talks over the phone with the fake officer. But after paying him Rs 1 lakh, he was in for a shock at the case hearing at Vijayawada ACB court where the judge sent Prasad to judicial custody. “That is when they realised they had lost the money and had not received any favour in the case,” a police official said.

---||Kolkata||One of city’s first FB fake-profile cases ends in 1-year jail, fine||Kolkata: The Alipore court has convicted a 30-year-old man for allegedly creating a fake Facebook profile of a law student of a reputable law institute, harassing and tarnishing her image. The judgement came after almost 10 years of trials. This is also one of the first cases recorded in Bengal, on September 2011, where social media was used to tarnish someone’s image. The case was investigated by the CID after the victim, a resident of Jadavpur, sought legal help. “Accused Suddhochit Banerjee had told investigators that he was pursuing graduation when he had a girlfriend who had been close to the victim. His girlfriend told him the victim had hurt her sentiments and, angry over her mental condition, Banerjee decided to teach the victim a lesson. On Monday, the judge handed the accused a total of one year of imprisonment and Rs 1.5 lakh as fine after convicting him under Section 66C (three months), 66D (three months) and 67C (six months) of IT Act,” said special prosecutor Bivas Chatterjee. The state, though, is likely to challenge the quantum of punishment. “We will be consulting the state before taking a decision. We had sought the maximum punishment of five years,” said a source. The victim, who is now a practising lawyer at the Supreme Court, is also likely to be consulted. The CID had taken over from Jadavpur police after a case was lodged on March 2011 by the victim’s father. “He had complained that a fake Facebook account had been created in the name of his daughter who was studying law at that point of time. The accused had posted obscene, sexually explicit and defaming pictures and text intending to insult the modesty and assassinate the character of the victim,” said an officer. During investigation, the CID had requested the Facebook authority to share the URL of the fake account and login IP address. From there, the mobile number used to create the fake account was traced to the accused. It was found that BSNL was the internet service provider who allocated the IPs and thereafter, the request was sent to the BSNL authority for login details. Subsequently, the BSNL authority sent the same and it was found that the subscriber details were in the name of the accused’s father. The said cellphone, computer and internet, though, were used exclusively by the accused, the CID found. The investigating agency on August 1, 2011, raided the accused’s house and seized the hard disk, modem, a telephone broadband connection bill and one mobile phone. These were sent to the Central Forensic Laboratory. After the accused was arrested, he told CID that the victim insulted his girlfriend on different occasions and his girlfriend had become demoralized due to such behaviour. After seeing the plight of his girlfriend, the accused wanted to teach the victim a lesson and created the fake account. “The CID had filed the charge sheet along with a supplementary charge sheet and the charge was framed under 66A, 66C, 66D and 67A of the IT Act. Subsequently, 66A became null and void. “When I was appointed as special PP in this case in the last part of 2016, I made a prayer before court for further examination of the hard disk from the forensic laboratory, which proved to be a turning point in the case and exact pictures and data used in the fake profile were found in it by CFSL. The judgement was delivered after examination of 13 witnesses,” said Chatterjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/one-of-citys-first-fb-fake-profile-cases-ends-in-1-year-jail-fine/articleshow/81638641.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Patna||‘Dry monsoon may trigger water crisis’||PATNA: Even as both the central and state governments have launched several ambitious schemes to mitigate the water woes of people, some experts caution them against an imminent crisis this summer. They foresee a drier monsoon, resulting in low rainfall and aggravating the water crisis in different parts of the state. According to the regional director of the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), A K Agrawal, the movement of Pacific currents has relatively slowed down which will lead to the slower movement of moisture. This is indicative of low rainfall which may accentuate the water crisis. “The second phase of the Jal Shakti Abhiyan will be launched by the Union government in April for augmenting water supply. Combined with the recent measures adopted by the state government under the Jal-Jivan-Hariyali scheme, the Centre’s initiative will certainly mitigate people’s sufferings due to water scarcity,” Agrawal told this newspaper. The state government had launched the Jal-Jivan-Hariyali scheme to raise the groundwater level by rejuvenating the dead water bodies at a cost of Rs 24,524 crore. “Almost two years have passed, but the desired results are yet to be seen,” environmentalist Mehta Nagendra Singh claimed and added, “The per capita availability of water in the state has declined considerably in the last four decades. The ever-increasing population and growing urbanization have accentuated the water crisis.” Agrawal pointed out that in 2006 the minor irrigation department had proposed to set up a State Ground Water Authority on the pattern of the CGWB, but “it is yet to see the light of day”. Later, the government planned to introduce a Bill on better management and conservation of groundwater in the legislature which did not materialise either. However, the secretary of the public health engineering department, Jitendra Srivastava, claimed that there was no need to worry as “no report of water shortage has been received from any part of the state”. “Altogether 600 teams have been roped in for repairing defective water yielding structures. They have already repaired handpumps in 53,412 of the 56,544 wards in the state,” Srivastava said, adding that they would return from the assigned areas only after completing their work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dry-monsoon-may-trigger-water-crisis/articleshow/81638534.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Congress invites Manjhi to join Mahagathbandhan||PATNA: Congress legislative party leader Ajit Sharma on Monday invited HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi to join the Mahagathbandhan and work for the benefit of Bihar. Manjhi is unhappy over not getting any of the 12 legislative council seats filled from the governor’s quota recently. Sharma even predicted major changes in Bihar politics after the West Bengal assembly elections. In a bid to woo back Mukesh Sahani, the Congress CLP leader also expressed sympathy with the VIP founder, who wanted a legislative council seat. “Both of them should have been given at least one seat each in the council from the governor’s quota. But instead of abiding by the gathbandhan dharma, JD(U) and BJP shared six seats each among themselves, ignoring the expectation of Manjhi and Sahani, who are public representatives,” he said. “Both are not comfortable in NDA and should think for the benefit of people in Bihar. This NDA government has not fulfilled any of its promises, be it providing employment or maintaining law and order. In fact, it was the Mahagathbandhan which got the mandate, but the NDA formed the government through wrong means,” Sharma added. Addressing a public meeting a couple of days earlier, Manjhi had admitted that he was upset, but not angry and had faith in chief minister Nitish Kumar. His party spokesperson Danish Rizwan told TOI that HAM(S) was with CM Nitish and all was well in the NDA alliance. However, another party insider said all is not well in the BJP-JD(U) alliance. JD(U) state spokesperson Ajnum Ara, however, said the Congress leader was daydreaming and his claim regarding big political changes after West Bengal elections were baseless. “Both Manjhi ji and Mukesh Sahani have made it clear that they are and will remain with NDA, which has got the people’s mandate and CM Nitish is doing fantastic work in the field of development. Those who want to work for people in Bihar will remain here,” said Anjum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/congress-invites-manjhi-to-join-mahagathbandhan/articleshow/81638264.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Several people who had built houses in the area staged a protest against the demolition. TDP and the Left parties extended support to the oustees. The oustees said their houses were demolished without giving notices and sufficient time to relocate. They alleged the officials had made them shelterless by razing down their houses for road widening. The officials denied the charges. Municipal commissioner Hemamalini said all the encrochers were identified and issued notices to vacate. She said several of them had approached the court but lost their cases. “We have enumerated the encroachers and sanctioned house sites to all the eligible poor. We will not render injustice to even a single eligible poor among the encroachers,” said local legislator Alla Ramakrishna Reddy. He, however, said that the detailed survey carried out by the officials found that many of the building owners on the encroached land were residing in their own houses elsewhere in the town and had leased the encroached houses to others. The legislator said they got favourable orders from the court after submitting the facts. He criticised TDP general secretary Nara Lokesh for trying to take advantage of the issue. “Lokesh lost the election in Mangalagiri because he neither knew the poor nor the development of the town,” he said. According to the survey by conducted by officials, at least 30 of 70 building owners were not residing in the encroached land. A few encroachers were also government employees. Local officials eliminated non-residents and ineligible people from getting compensation or alternative house site from the government.

Even if the efficacy of a vaccine is 60-85%, the chances are that one would get a milder form of Covid-19 if s/he is already vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated groups,” Sanjay Lalwani, medical director of Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical Hospital and Research Centre, said. Subhal Dixit, director, critical care, Sanjeevan Hospital and MJM Hospital, said, “Vaccination gives about 60-85% protection against the infection once both the shots have been administered. Antibodies start developing after two to three weeks of getting the second shot. Thus, the chances of getting infection are reduced after that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-ask-people-to-get-the-shot/articleshow/81638748.cms||---

With the state reporting over 25,000 cases daily, he told me that the situation was worrisome and if the cases continued to rise, there would be no option but to resort to imposing a lockdown,” said Tope, who was in Pune for a private event. He said there would be discussions with all the leaders on what measures would be taken in the next couple of days. “The chief minister has the final authority to declare lockdown in the state, while the local authorities have been given full authority to implement strict containment measures,” the minister said. Tope said while Pune was conducting the highest number of tests in the state, the testing had been increased in other places also. He also said the government was focused on vaccinating people fast in the state. “On any given day, we are vaccinating around 3 lakh people. Our aim is to vaccinate 20-21 lakh people in a week,” he said. Tope said there was a possibility that other states were not reporting daily Covid-19 cases accurately. He said he recently saw on television over 75,000 people watching a cricket match in Gujarat without maintaining social distance. Citing the public rallies in the election-bound states, he raised his apprehension about under-reporting of Covid cases there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-cm-to-review-situation-in-2-3-days/articleshow/81638739.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Railway security and health staff have been deployed at all the major stations falling under the jurisdiction of ECR to keep a close watch on the passengers reaching Bihar by Holi special trains. ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said at least seven pairs of Holi special trains are being run to facilitate people reach their native places during the festival. “Railways has already extended services of 24 pairs of special passenger trains either originating from or passing through ECR jurisdiction till June end,” he added. Kumar said apart from Patna Junction and Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, Barauni, Samastipur, Hajipur, Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga are some other stations where railway health and security staff have been deputed to keep a close vigil on the arrival of passengers from other states. “Railway health paramedical staff have been conducting random screening of passengers in coordination with the state health department. They are being allowed to go home only after proper screening,” Kumar added. Danapur divisional railway manager Sunil Kumar said Patna Junction and Rajendra Nagar Terminal are two major stations of the division from where maximum number of Holi special and other special trains are originating. “Though only passengers with confirmed tickets are allowed to enter station premises after proper screening, fresh thermal screening has been started at these stations for passengers. Railway doctors and paramedical staff are on the job with full cooperation from the state health department,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/as-covid-cases-spike-railways-beefs-up-screening-of-travellers/articleshow/81638854.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Business||Sebi seeks clarity from exchange||TNN Mumbai: Markets regulator Sebi has given the NSE’s board of directors 21 days to determine why the bourse’s management failed to shift the exchange’s trading operations from its primary site to disaster recovery site within the time frame specified by the regulator after its systems stopped on February 24. Sebi also asked NSE’s board to fix individual responsibilities for the trading blackout. On February 24, due to failures at multiple levels at NSE, the day’s trading on the exchange was halted for about four hours and to limit losses that market participants could have incurred, the session was extended on NSE, BSE and Metropolitan Stock Exchange (MSEI) by one and half hours till 5pm. On Monday, Sebi also came out with new rules for market infrastructure institutions (MIIs) to ensure faster restoration of operations in case of any disaster or technical glitch. The rules include unannounced shift of live trading to a disaster recovery site and declaring a disaster within 30 minutes of the incident, down from two hours now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-seeks-clarity-from-exchange/articleshow/81639489.cms||---

Speaking to TOI, Piramal Enterprises executive director Rajesh Laddha said that the financial services division of the group has raised Rs 18,000 crore of equity capital in the last two years by selling its stake in companies and through fund-raising. Laddha added that the company has strengthened its balance sheet and improved its credit profile. “We do not have to infuse any more equity into the business even with merged DHFL. We have a debt-equity ratio of around two in the financial services business,” he said. The Rs 4,050-crore bond issue was subscribed to largely by SBI, Union Bank and Indian Bank. The bonds, which have a rating of AA, have a tenure of five years and offer 9.25%. Laddha said that the group has restructured its portfolio to convert all liability into long-term. “Since the beginning of FY20, we have significantly transformed the liabilities profile towards more stable, long-term sources of funds. The company has raised over Rs 50,000 crore since April 2019 through multiple long-term borrowings and equity transactions, thereby materially strengthening the balance sheet,” he said. According to Laddha, after the merger with DHFL, the credit profile of the company will improve even further. He said that the 6.75% that the bank was offering on its bonds as part of the acquisition price reflected the post-acquisition cost of funds. Last month, Piramal’s resolution plan for DHFL got cleared by the RBI. This was after a majority of creditors approved Piramal’s bid over rival Oaktree. DHFL was referred to the National Company Law Tribunal in December 2019 after its operations were taken over by the RBI following irregularities by the previous management. Although banks are recovering a small part of their loan exposure, the sale will boost their bottom line as they have fully provided for their DHFL exposure, which was classified as a fraud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/piramal-raises-rs-4k-cr-to-reverse-merge-dhfl/articleshow/81639557.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||Telecom service, hardware failure led to outage: NSE||MUMBAI: A combination of completely unexpected events led to the four-hour traded halt on the NSE on February 24, according to a root cause analysis by system experts at the country’s largest exchange. One of the critical failures was by a vendor that had a proprietary system embedded into its hardware but was not disclosed to the exchange. This in turn led to stoppage of several of NSE’s trading-related systems including risk management, clearing & settlement, index and surveillance systems. As a result, NSE was forced to halt trading and bring the system back before restarting regular trading. NSE also said that it did not shift to the disaster recovery (DR) site because, while Sebi had allowed a four-hour trading halt before shifting to the DR site, the exchange was sure to start trading on its primary site in less than the four-hour passage it had in such situations. NSE’s report noted that on February 24, digging and construction activities disrupted both its telecom links between its primary site at BKC in central Mumbai and near disaster recovery (NDR) site at Kurla. The distance between the two locations is about 5km. Its DR site is located in Chennai. As the telecom system failed on that day, one of its critical hardware, called Storage Area Network (SAN) system that was to work despite such interruptions during testing, also failed. According to a top NSE official, the exchange had specified a particular design to the vendor which was supplied. However, in addition to what NSE wanted in the design, the vendor had an additional option within the hardware which was not documented. On February 24, the option that was not documented and outside of NSE’s design requirement, kicked in and led to failures at various levels. The NSE report also said that interoperability of trading and clearing systems worked perfectly even when NSE’s trading stopped. As a result, market players were able to shift their positions from NSE to BSE in a smooth manner. However, there were some lacunae with the earlier specifications due to which interoperability was not fully functional. NSE said that report was discussed with its technical advisory committee which has independent experts. After that, this was also discussed with the technical advisory committee of Sebi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/telecom-service-hardware-failure-led-to-outage-nse/articleshow/81639534.cms||---
---||Varanasi||KVT-Gyanvapi case next hearing on March 25||Varanasi: The hearing of the Kashi Vishwanath temple-Gyanvapi mosque case was held on Monday and the district court fixed the next date on March 25 on the petitioner’s plea for survey of the entire compound by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Advocate Vijay Shankar Rastogi, as the ‘next friend’ of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar, had filed an application in the court of civil judge in December 2019, requesting for the survey of the entire Gyanvapi compound by the ASI. Later in January 2020, Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee had filed an objection against the petition. Legal proceedings in the case had first started in 1991, when a petition was filed in Varanasi civil court on behalf of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar seeking permission for worship in Gyanvapi. The petitioner had contended that Kashi Vishwanath Temple was built by Maharaja Vikramaditya about 2,050 years ago, but Mughal emperor Aurangzeb destroyed the temple in 1664 and used its remains to construct Gyanvapi masjid on a portion of the temple land. The petitioner requested the court to issue directions for removal of the mosque and giving the land back to temple trust. The petition also stated that the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act was not applicable on the suit as the mosque was constructed on a partly-demolished temple and many parts of the temple exist even today. In 1998, Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee had moved the high court saying the dispute could not be adjudicated by a civil court as it was barred by law. The high court stayed the proceedings in lower court which continued for the past 22 years. In February 2020, the petitioners approached the lower court again with a plea to resume the hearing as the HC had not extended the stay in past six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kvt-gyanvapi-case-next-hearing-on-march-25/articleshow/81639364.cms||---

Active cases in Madurai is now at 151, which is the highest in the southern region. “The positivity rate has gone up to over 3% in Madurai, so there definitely is a slight increase in cases in the last few days especially in corporation areas, as new cases are being reported though there are no clusters. However, the situation is under control and safety measures have been intensified,” said a senior health official in Madurai. Around 2,000-2,500 samples are currently being tested per day in Madurai and testing is expected to be increased further. Dindigul has the second highest number of active cases in the region with 113 cases. District health officials said there is no need for panic as testing has also been increased to 1,500 in the district. In some of the southern districts like Tirunelveli, Virudhunagar, and Tenkasi, less than 1,000 swab samples are taken per day even as cases are seeing a steady rise. “Previously, even around 1,000-2,000 samples were being tested in the district when cases were at their peak in the state. Now, as there has been a marginal rise in cases in the last few days, testing will be increased. Random samples will also be increased to monitor the situation better. As the number of contacts increase, testing will also increase,” said a health official from Tirunelveli. In Tenkasi, safety checks have been intensified at Puliyarai check post and samples are being collected for testing. Around 500 samples are being tested per day in the district. “Covid-19 testing is focused on contacts and accordingly it will be increased. Meetings have been conducted with all departments to ensure better enforcement of SOPs in public places and establishments,” said a district health official. Meanwhile, in Virudhunagar, around 700-800 samples are being tested per day, while 3,000 samples were tested when cases were at its peak. Health officials said that containment measures have been intensified in areas where Covid-19 cases are reported. Across districts, apart from intensifying preventive measures, Covid-19 vaccination is also being encouraged by health officials among those who are eligible. As per data from the CoWin platform, as many as 3,26,372 beneficiaries have received the Covid-19 vaccine in south Tamil Nadu, which forms 18% of those vaccinated overall in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/covid-19-testing-yet-to-pick-up-in-southern-dists-active-cases-rise/articleshow/81639506.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The task force also noticed deaths due to myocarditis, inflammation of heart muscles, in the second wave. “While the present Covid-19 strain hasn’t resulted in higher mortality, the people who died have succumbed to myocarditis and not due to lung involvement seen widely in the pandemic,” said task force member Dr Shashank Joshi.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Auto driver’s son gets 41 on AIR meter||AHMEDABAD: When the going gets tough, the tough get going. This adage found an exemplar in Kishore Chandarana, an autorickshaw driver’s son, who was crestfallen when it took him four attempts to clear the CA intermediate exams. Then he made up his mind that he will score an All India Rank in the final exams, come what may! Chandarana realized his dream when he scored AIR 41 in the CA final exams; the results were declared on Monday. Five students from the city have found a place in the Top 50 list of the country. Chandarana’s success is sweetest as it comes in the backdrop of a bitter struggle with poverty and huge sacrifices made by his family and the support shown by his community. Chandarana says people from his community helped his father pay his fees for CA coaching and also fees for the library where he would study. His one-room-kitchen house in Sarkhejwas too congested to offer an environment conducive to studying. The big blow came when his father’s income shrank during Covid-19 lockdown and the library shut citing pandemic curbs. Forced to stay home, Chandarana made his terrace his study room under the open sky. Rain or shine, Chandarana would spend hours with thick CA books. His sister Gopi dropped out of the education system due to the poor financial condition of the family. She took up a job paying Rs 10,000 to help the family make both ends meet and enable Chandarana to study without worrying about the next meal. “I am extremely sensitive to the sacrifices my sister has made for me. It is my duty and dream to put Gopi back in college,” says Chandarana. “She wants to become a lawyer and I will ensure that she takes admission in the LLB course.” The young man has trained his sights on a corporate job and wants his father to retire as an auto driver. “I know the importance of society putting its might behind a youth. Just like people helped me, I will fund the education of needy youth.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/auto-drivers-son-gets-41-on-air-meter/articleshow/81640934.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Highest number of daily cases reported on Monday coincides with most Covid-19 daily tests conducted in the state for the year. With more testing, weekly positivity rate in MP has dipped to 5.05% (sixth highest in the country). The weekly average in India is 3.7%. Positivity rate for Monday was high at 5.2%.

---||Pune||Maharashtra: New vax plan encourages more on-site registrations||PUNE: State health officials have now asked local authorities to encourage more on-site CoWIN registrations of vaccine beneficiaries instead of prior appointments. The move, officials reasoned, will speed up vaccination coverage. A senior state official said, “We have always allowed on-site registrations. But now we’ve asked those eligible for shots to reach sites directly and use the help of staff there to register on the CoWIN app. This will save time. All centres have been asked to appoint personnel who can help with registrations.” State authorities said on-site registrations will boost walk-ins as they increase the number of vaccination centres (to 300). Maharashtra currently has over 2,000 operational centres. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has already announced the new strategy via its Twitter handle. Officials said Pune district is set to follow. “We want to scale up daily vaccination to 40,000 in the coming weeks from the current day's count of 20,000-25,000,” said Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle. “We have 200 sites and our target is to increase that total to 250. Beneficiaries can reach these sites directly,” he added. Citizens, however, said the move could lead to crowding and long queues for registrations at vaccine sites. A senior citizen who recently visited a centre said her turn came at 1pm, despite arriving at the centre at 6.30am. “We were all asked to wait after being given token numbers. Around 250 vaccinations are done at one centre, and token numbers for nearly 125 people are given in the morning and afternoon,” she said. But vaccination targets are being set higher. Statewide, officials said they plan to inoculate three lakh people daily, up from the current two lakh. As for vaccination sites, the state health department has made a demand to set up centres at 367 government and private hospitals. Presently, permission has been granted by the Centre for 209 sites. The rest of the sites are being considered, state authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-vax-plan-encourages-more-on-site-registrations/articleshow/81638752.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Ritik Sharma, 17, a third-year mechanical engineering student from Dayalbagh Educational Institute in Uttar Pradesh is the youngest to qualify. Usually, BTech graduates or final-year students take the exam. Sankaranarayanan Sankarapandian is a retired teacher from the IIT-Madras zone and has qualified in both computer science & engineering and mathematics. He had completed his MSc in 1976 from AVVM Sri Pushpam College, Thanjavur. The organising institutes do not impose an age bar on candidates. An 88-year-old was the oldest to register for the test this year but did not appear for it eventually. GATE is a qualifying exam for those seeking admissions to masters and PhD programmes in science and technology and placements in public sector undertakings. The success rate in the exam is usually below 20%. Of the 1.26 lakh candidates who cleared the exam, one-fourth are currently in their final-year, also the highest numbers in any category, said Deepankar Choudhury, from IIT-Bombay, organising chairman of GATE 2021. This could be probably because the final-year students are in their regular studies and GATE is mainly based on undergraduate syllabus, he added. Due to the pandemic, IIT-Bombay, the organising institute for GATE 2021, allowed third-year students to appear for the competitive exam too. Close to 10,000 students in this group have qualified in the test. Around 26,000 who qualified, completed their graduation last year and 3,837 candidates graduated in 2015 as well. GATE, jointly organised by the seven older IITs and IISc-Bengaluru, was conducted in 27 subjects this year, with the addition of humanities & social sciences and environmental science & engineering. Toppers in at least six subjects are from the IIT-Bombay zone, including the linguistics paper under humanities. The institutes had opened the exam to humanities students for the first time. The success rate in each of the subjects varied from 8.4% to 29.5%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/67-year-old-from-iit-madras-zone-cracks-gate/articleshow/81640221.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Pune||Pune: Covid-19 inoculation drive shoots past 5-lakh mark||PUNE: A record number of daily Covid-19 vaccinations on Monday — of over 34,000 beneficiaries — sent overall coverage in the district past the five-lakh mark. There are now at least 5.2 lakh people in the district now who’ve received at least one dose of the vaccine.. The vaccination drive, which began on January 16, picked up impressive momentum from March 1, when it expanded to cover citizens from the two priority groups — those aged 60 and above and people over 45 with underlying conditions. On Monday, the PMC recorded 15,284 vaccinations. In Pimpri Chinchwad, there were 4,960 beneficiaries. In Pune rural, over 14,000 people received their shots. On March 2, the total number of vaccinated beneficiaries in the district was at around 1.32 lakh. That surged to over 5 lakh within the next 20 days, thanks to an increase in the number of vaccination sites and response from citizens, especially the elderly. So far, the PMC has vaccinated 2,61,956 people; the PCMC has covered 95,635; the Pune rural administration has vaccinated 1,63,367 individuals. Officials said many of the early niggles, including problems with registration, have been ironed out. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “When we started vaccinating healthcare workers from January 16, there was no consistency in the process. It was initial practice. We are now operating over 200 vaccination sites in the district and with this pace, we will be able to hit the current target of around 16 lakh beneficiaries by the fourth week of April.” Deshmukh said there are enough vaccine reserves in the district. Maharashtra has also asked the Centre to provide 2.2 crore vaccine doses, at a supply rate of 20 lakh doses each week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ncov-inoculation-drive-shoots-past-5-lakh-mark/articleshow/81638757.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Pune||Patil, other BJP workers booked on charge of unlawful assembly||Pune: The Vishrambaug police on Sunday night booked the state president of BJP, Chandrakant Patil, two former MLAs and other BJP workers on the charges of unlawful assembly and spreading Covid infection after they and other party members demonstrated at Alka Talkies Chowk against home minister Anil Deshmukh over the alleged “Rs100-crore monthly extortion” row. Constable Ganesh Turke of the Vishrambaug police registered the complaint against Patil and others. Police registered the case under sections 143, 145, 147, 149, 188, 269 and 270 of the Indian Penal Code. The police also invoked the provisions of the Disaster Management Act against them. Patil, former MLAs Jagdish Mulik and Yogesh Tilekar, and 50 other BJP members from Pune had gathered at Alka Talkies Chowk around 10.30am on Sunday. “After spotting them at the chowk, we gave them a notice under Section 149 of the CrPC and asked them to leave immediately,” said senior inspector Vijay Tikole of the Vishrambaug police. “Owing to the Covid-19 situation in the city, assembly of five or more than five persons is banned. It averts the spread of the infection. They did not seek permission of the police to stage the protest. Despite the notice being issued, Patil and others gathered at the chowk from 10.30am to 12.30pm and staged demonstration,” Tikole said. When contacted, Patil said, “We protested for a cause and the government has filed a complaint against me and others. I shall face the case.” The BJP members demonstrated against home minister Deshmukh after former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh wrote a letter to the government stating that the former had asked policemen to collect monthly extortion of Rs100 crore from different establishments in Mumbai.

The steps are being planned, following a spike in Covid-19 cases in the city. “We are targeting the places that have more gatherings. The teams will conduct random checks. All the markets in every civic ward have been told to strictly follow social distancing norms. We also plan to make continuous announcements at public places to make people aware about the norms,” a Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official said. Ashish Mahaddalkar, head of the Vishrambaug-Kasba Peth civic ward, said the teams from his office had already ramped up vigil. The area under the civic ward had densely crowded markets and vulnerable spots. “We have issued detailed instructions to the vendors at market places about the measures they are expected to follow, which include provision of sanitizers and following of social distancing norms. Our squads are starting visits to the vulnerable spots in the morning and evening hours,” he said. Another officer attached to the Vishrambaug-Kasba Peth civic ward said that recently they had initiated action against a shopkeeper, who was dealing with customers despite being symptomatic. They had also initiated action against a bank’s branch that was overcrowded and defying social distancing norms. Meanwhile, vendors from the Mahatma Phule Mandai said that they would not entertain customers that came without masks. The bulk purchasers and tempo operators had been told to follow the measures. Rajabhau Kasurde, leader of the vendors from Mandai, said, “We keep appealing to the buyers to maintain social distancing. But, many defy the instructions. The vendors will not entertain such buyers. We have also told every vendor to use masks all the time and avoid visiting the market if they have any symptoms. We are also exploring ways to keep maximum distance between the vendors”.

The Nasik Municipal Corporation (NMC) could collect only Rs 8 crore between February 16 and March 21 due to rise in Covid-19 cases in the city from the second week of February. The staff of property tax department have been engaged in activities related to Covid-19 like tracing and conducting surveys. The property tax revenue of the NMC has declined by 23% to Rs 107 crore (as on March 21) in the current financial year, against Rs 140 crore in the last year. “The property tax collection has been badly affected due to Covid-19 pandemic. There is still a shortfall of Rs 33 crore in the collection this year as compared to the last fiscal,” said Pradeep Chaudhari, deputy commissioner (tax) of NMC. “We have also issued warrants to 139 defaulters, who own large properties, having dues amounting to Rs 20 crore. We have warned them of confiscation of their properties if they don’t clear the dues within the stipulated time,” said Chaudhari. “We are expecting to add Rs 3 crore more by the end of this fiscal,” Chaudhari added. In a bid to clear dues, NMC had introduced an amnesty scheme in three phases between November and February. During these phases, NMC collected Rs 33.42 crore from 55,209 defaulters. Of which, it collected Rs 23.34 crore dues during the first phase by January 15 and Rs 7.41 crore dues in the second phase by February 15. Last year too, NMC had brought an amnesty scheme and collected Rs 45 crore dues from the property tax defaulters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-stares-at-shortfall-in-property-tax-collection/articleshow/81636980.cms||Tushar Pawar

After advocate general Kamal Trivedi submitted the suggestion before court, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice I R Vora asked the government to take appropriate decision on fee reduction and apprise the court by March 26. During the hearing, appearing for the petitioner NGO, Bridge Forum For All, advocate Anand Yagnik submitted that the state government had supported reduction of fees in private schools by 25%. He stated, “The impact of Covid-19 pandemic is the same for the college going students and their parents. Covid- 19 did not discriminate between schools and colleges, but the state of Gujarat definitely discriminates between the parents of those students studying in schools and colleges. Such discrimination arises from selective intervention by the state and is fatal and unconstitutional.” Justice Mehta has been heading two committees that look into the possibility of fee reduction in private and aided colleges. Earlier this month, the high court had asked the state government to inform the court about the progress in the proceedings before the committees. The PIL seeks HC directions to the government to form a policy for all colleges and institutes of higher education to partially waive off tuition or college fees until they remain shut and charge only reasonable fees to students. The colleges should not collect charges for miscellaneous activities, which are not taking place while the campuses are closed. The PIL also urged the court to ensure online education for all students irrespective of payment of tuition fees till the universities resume physical functioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/panels-suggest-10-fee-cut-in-colleges/articleshow/81640985.cms||---

Recently, a three-and-a-half-month-old boy from Uganda, born with serious heart-related deformities, was operated upon at Wockhardt Hospital. Micah Sekakoni had an 11mm hole in his heart. Pediatric cardiac surgeon Dr Sandeep Khanzode cured it. “The baby had a complex heart disease known as ‘endocardial cushion defect’ and ‘AV septal defect,” said Dr Khanzode. Endocardial cushion defect (ECD) is an abnormal heart condition. The walls separating all the four chambers of the heart are poorly formed or are absent. Also, the valves separating the upper and lower chambers of the heart have defects during formation. ECD is a congenital heart disease since birth. “The baby’s mitral valve was straddling a problem which makes surgery difficult. The surgery was done with several minute vigilances and the baby made a very quick recovery,” added Dr Khanzode. Parents said they decided to bring their child to India for post-operative care because Uganda does not facilities for such a high-end pediatric surgery. Local authorities advised them get the surgery done at Wockhardt Hospital. “When we started contacting the team of Nagpur’s Workhardt hospital, we felt quite assured in bringing our child here and getting him treated. This assurance increased even more once we reached the hospital,” said Charlie Sekakoni, father of Micah. “We had our own concerns regarding coming to a different country all together where we don’t know anybody and our child is to undergo a major surgery. But the doctors and staff made us feel at ease,” he said. “We are trying to achieve new milestones in healthcare. Nagpur has already achieved a status where we provide treatment at par with metro cities,” said Abhinandan Dastenavar, Centre Head, Wockhardt Hospitals, Nagpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ugandan-infants-heart-mended-in-nagpur/articleshow/81639516.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The directions come after data (till March 19) showed more than 39,000 doses — of Covishield and Covaxin — have been lost in Pune district. The PMC has reported a wastage of 20,548 Covishield and 5,316 Covaxin doses till March 19. The PCMC has reported the lowest wastage in the district — 2,485 doses of Covishield and 162 doses of Covaxin discarded. Local authorities have also been directed to monitor power supply to cold chain units storing the vaccine. Officials said there are more than 250 such facilities in the district. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “The allowable wastage for Covid-19 vaccines has been fixed at 10%. In Pune district, wastage is at 8%, which is fine. The directive to civic bodies is a reminder to be wary of wastage.” Deshmukh said low wastage also indicates more people are being inoculated. He added, “Vaccine waste is a factor in immunisation programmes worldwide. We are accounting for this 10% allowable wastage while ordering doses.” An official from District Hospital, Aundh, which administers Covaxin, said since a vial of the shot has 20 doses, they open the containers only when there are at least 15 beneficiaries present to avoid wastage. A vial has to be used up within four hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccine-waste-at-8-authorities-to-ensure-cold-chain-facilities-stay-cool/articleshow/81638777.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Chandigarh||Soon, Punjab to enforce groundwater extraction & conservation rules||CHANDIGARH: Witnessing the fastest depleting groundwater reserves in the country, Punjab is going to have its groundwater extraction and conservation guidelines enforced within a month. The groundwater table in Punjab has been declining at the rate of 25-30 centimetres per annum in the past two decades. The Central Ground Water Board has already warned that Punjab could turn into a desert state in 25 years. Headed by former chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh, the Punjab Water Regulation and Development Authority (PWRDA) had called for objections from the public on draft guidelines. The authority is now in the process of finalising guidelines. PWRDA secretary Arunjit Singh Miglani told TOI, “We are finalising the rates for water extraction. The idea is that conservation will happen only if you pay for water. But the payment of groundwater charges also has to be commensurate with the ability to pay. It would not hurt the industry.” At the same time, the former IAS officer said, the scheme had incentives for water conservation and for every cubic metre water saved, there will be Rs 2.5 credit (rebate) on the charges. Once these guidelines are finalised, extraction of groundwater by all consumers, other than agriculture, drinking and domestic use, would be regulated by it. Stressing on the need for conservation of water, Miglani said the first step was water education and without the community participation nothing can be done. “Nothing will be forced but everyone will be persuaded. Unless people believe in it, nothing can happen,” he added. Asked about the questions raised by leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema in the recently concluded budget session of the state assembly the PWRDA was not functioning as expected, Miglani said, “If you compare us with other states like Maharashtra, they took many years to start function even after constitution of the water regulatory body.” He added as this authority was new, they would gradually get more manpower, do research and take other effective steps. At present, the PWRDA was mainly focusing on finalising the groundwater conservation guidelines and body’s meetings were held at least twice a week, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/soon-pb-to-enforce-groundwater-extraction-conservation-rules/articleshow/81639524.cms||Sanjeev Verma

---||Chandigarh||‘Punjab to raise basmati area for less water use’||Chandigarh: On World Water Day, the Punjab government emphasised on a three-pronged strategy to check depleting groundwater in the state. Punjab agriculture director Sukhdev Singh Sidhu said they were going to promote basmati rice to make more farmers switch to direct-seeded rice (DSR) technique of sowing paddy which uses less water. He said the DSR technique was used on around 20-25% of the area (5 lakh hectares) last year, and the target was to double it in the upcoming season. “Farmers are keen on using the technique and an adequate number of machines will be made available,” he said. On promoting basmati, Sidhu said it was estimated to have been sown over 4.06 lakh hectares last season and the area will be increased to over 7 lakh hectares this year. “There is no minimum support price (MSP) for basmati and all stocks are supplied for export through private trade. We have launched campaigns to make the farmers conform to export parameters, so that the crop is pesticide and residue free.” With Punjab having set aside Rs 200 crore in the budget estimates for 2021-22 for crop diversification, Sidhu said it will help farmers switch to horticulture and cotton to break the wheat-rice cycle. Awareness among farmers was key to achieving objectives and 1,000 camps will be held across Punjab before April 30 for this, he added. “Farming can be made profitable only by making farmers adopt DSR, crop residue management and diversify crops away from paddy,” he said. Regarding concerns expressed by a section of farmers about DSR, the agriculture director said, “This technique is more scientific than regular paddy transplantation that most farmers have been using so far.” The agriculture department has appealed to the farmers to sow the PR-126 variety of paddy as it is best suited for the DSR technique. The PUSA-44 variety should be avoided. The target is to bring at least one-third of the total paddy area barring basmati under DSR. Also, an allocation of Rs 40 crore has been made for in-situ crop residue management under which a total of 50,815 residue management machines have already been provided to farmers and cooperative societies at subsidised rates. The state has also made a provision of Rs 361 crore for horticulture in the budget. The state budget has allocated Rs 300 crore for providing support to sugarcane farmers and Rs 60 crore for modernisation of sugar mills at Gurdaspur and Batala. The issue of depleting groundwater was discussed in detail during the budget session of the Punjab assembly and several suggestions were given to check the disturbing trend of dependence on the wheat-rice crop cycle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-to-raise-basmati-area-for-less-water-use/articleshow/81639542.cms||---

The petitioners had demanded that they should be permitted to visit ICU of the hospital with a photographer and that the inquiry commission should provide them the documents submitted by others with regard to the fire incident. The single-judge bench had issued notice and sought reply from the state government and from the secretary to the commission.In its appeal, the government has contended that the issue pertaining to the fire is pending before the division bench in form of two separate litigations seeking various reliefs on this issue. When the matters on this subject are pending before the division bench, the single judge ought not to have entertained the petition.Before the single judge, the relatives of victims of Shrey Hospital fire incident had expressed apprehension that the inquiry commission might submit final report without giving them a chance of hearing. They had also challenged the probe panel’s decision of rejecting their request to visit the hospital. Opposing the petition, the state government had submitted before the single judge that the petition could not be entertain at all.The single-judge bench had rejected the state government’s contention and observed that the earlier head of this inquiry commission, Justice (retd) K A Puj, had parted with documents on request by the victims’ relatives. The judge had also observed that the petitioners are not strangers, but relatives of the victims, and their petition cannot be rejected straightaway as demanded by the state government.The victim families said they are shocked at the callous attitude of the government in challenging the innocuous order by the high court and showing interest in extraordinary winding up the commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-appeals-against-stay-order-on-probe-panels-report/articleshow/81640984.cms||---

---||Vadodara||Leaders hit new low in acrimony||Vadodara: The annual senate meeting of the M S University, which met after a gap of two years, witnessed acrimonious scenes over the controversy surrounding the varsity’s land. The meeting on Monday was held at the Deep auditorium of BBA building instead of the senate hall at university head office in view of Covid-19 pandemic. After the presentation of the annual report ended, Congress leader and senate member from technology faculty, Narendra Ravat, questioned why the university authorities were evading answer related to donating or selling university’s land free of cost. Ravat had asked whether the vice-chancellor or syndicate members can sell or donate the land. The university authorities have replied in writing that the information is ‘exhaustive’. Things turned ugly when Ravat alleged that the BJP-backed syndicate members, who have a majority in both senate and syndicate bodies, had ‘sold off’ the land and that the university has received nothing against its value of Rs 200 crore that is transferred to the state government for construction of samras hostels.BJP-backed senate members — Jigar Inamdar, Mehul Lakhani and Mayank Patel — fiercely countered Ravat. Two other senate members — Kapil Joshi and Nikul Patel — entered into heated arguments with the trio in Ravat’s support.The meeting witnessed murky mudslinging, personalized attacks with Ravat alleging that the syndicate members were selling off the land of the university and the saffron group calling him ‘katki baaz’ (habitual of taking commissions illegally). The shouting match and ruckus continued for a while after which Ravat walked out of the meeting.Later in the day, Joshi sat on the floor of the house to protest against the short time given to him to make a representation regarding alleged irregularities in the university’s budget.Joshi said that while he was asked to wind up within 10 minutes, another senate member who was praising the university authorities was given 20 minutes so that he can continue with these adulations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/leaders-hit-new-low-in-acrimony/articleshow/81637751.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Joint teams seize 700 litre illicit liquor, arrest 200 in Prayagraj||PRAYAGRAJ: Joint teams of police and excise officials have been conducting a series of raids in fields deep in the trans-Ganga and Yamuna areas in a crackdown on hooch trade ahead of the festival of Holi and upcoming panchayat polls in the state. The teams have seized illicit liquor and material in huge quantities and arrested around 200 people. The agricultural fields are used to store raw material and to prepare illicit liquor by hooch manufacturers. The police teams conducted raids recently in Soraon, Mauaima, Holagarh, Saidabad, Meja, Manda. IG, Prayagraj range, K P Singh told TOI, “A massive drive has been launched in Prayagraj, Pratapgarh, Kaushambi and Fatehpur districts against mafia involved in illegal hooch trade.” “Our joint teams have seized over 700 litre of spurious liquor and arrested over 200 people involved in the illicit manufacturing and trade in the past fortnight,” he added. The teams also destroyed over 7,000 kg raw material and scores of furnaces during the drive. The hooch traders dig pits in the field and hide raw materials and Lahan in them. Officials of police and excise departments tightened the noose around hooch mafia after many casualties in Pratapgarh and Prayagraj due to consumption of spurious liquor and are maintaining strict vigil on 56 villages infamous for hooch manufacturing and trade. A senior official preferring anonymity said some families in remote villages also engage in hooch trade in festive seasons and during elections. They also set up units on riverbanks for manufacturing spurious liquor. Police teams are making efforts to win the trust of villagers for information to crack down on hooch mafia and a mass awareness campaign is underway in trans-Ganga and Yamuna pockets. “Due to their greed for profits when demand is high, hooch manufactures use raw material like methanol which can be deadly and can cause blindness, severe burning in stomach and can be fatal,” said a senior excise official. They also add zinc, carbon, rectified spirit and other harmful chemicals to make it strong, he added. Usually, spurious liquor is made using jaggery, alum, ammonium chloride and essence. Instead of ethyl alcohol, methanol is used to add punch to the country-made liquor which often proves fatal. Methanol affects lungs, heart, eyes, liver and kidney. It also causes paralysis of muscles due to acidosis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/joint-teams-seize-700-litre-illicit-liquor-arrest-200-in-prayagraj/articleshow/81639612.cms||---

The court of judicial magistrate P J Raichura also ordered the convict Dinesh Sharma to pay Rs 10 lakh of which Rs 7.5 lakh will be paid to the complainant Jitendra Solanki. Solanki, a resident of New Sama Road, claimed that he gave a loan of Rs 9.45 lakh to Sharma, who owns Rajasthan Bhel House and Rajasthan Kulfi House, in 2013. The duo had signed an agreement according to which Sharma had to repay the money within two years. Sharma had given two post-dated cheques of Rs 5 lakh and Rs 4.45 lakh to Solanki. In June 2015, when Solanki deposited the cheque of Rs 5 lakh value, it was returned by the bank as Sharma’s bank account did not have sufficient balance. “When I asked him to return my money, he sent me a legal notice claiming that I was asking for money despite the payment being done so I sent him a counter notice and registered a case against him,” said Solanki. “We submitted the notarized agreement regarding the transaction and could also gave evidences that the cheques given by the accused were dishonoured due to insufficient funds in his bank account,” said Solanki’s lawyer Juned Saiyed.The court upheld the evidence and sentenced Sharma to imprisonment for one year and an additional imprisonment for 60 days if he fails to pay Rs 10 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bizman-sent-to-jail-for-not-repaying-money/articleshow/81637779.cms||---

The tower’s interiors and exteriors were repaired and painted and old wooden parts were removed under the supervision of the heritage cell of the AMC.The main challenge was to repair the mechanism of the four-faced clock, its proverbial heart. For this, Percy Daruwala, a master clock restorer, was brought in from Navsari. Daruwala and his friend-cum-fellow restorer, Kanti Panchal, had earlier restored the tower clock at Bhadra fort.“The mechanism is complex, and the original parts of such clocks are not available. Thus, the experts followed the design and made the parts on their own. Like the Bhadra clock, this clock’s mechanism was also imported, and the team studied contemporary clocks and literature before the restoration,” said an official close to the development, adding that the clock will require regular maintenance and upkeep.Heritage cell officials point out that the tower is a Grade IIA protected structure and part of the inscribed UNESCO World Heritage City of Ahmedabad. ‘Clock towers in civic areas were a feature introduced by the British and this became an important element of civic architecture in the city in the early 20th century,’ read the description of the clock in the heritage cell’s records. ‘This particular tower is a miniaturized version of the Tower typology that was prominent with four-sided, four storied structures which reduced in size at every level. Built out of masonry, the design followed the typical stone construction motifs with strengthened corners and central windows on all sides.’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/96-year-old-kalupur-clock-tower-gets-new-lease-of-life/articleshow/81640989.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Pune||Covid-19 spread: Pimpri Chinchwad civic body to colour code zones||PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) will mark its zones red, orange and yellow to show severity of Covid-19 spread, besides cracking a whip on rule violators to check virus spread. The move follows a rapid rise in the number of Covid cases in the PCMC limits in the past few weeks. There are over 10,000 active cases in the municipal limits as of Monday, with over 2,000 patients being hospitalised. The zones with over 20% of total active Covid-19 cases will be marked ‘red’, those with 5-20% will be marked orange, while those with less than 5% active count will be assigned yellow colour. Municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil has instructed zonal officers to seal societies, buildings and colonies in the red zones and increase police patrolling and awareness in such areas to curb the virus spread. He has also sought creation of a zonal war room with a helpline and flying squads to ramp up action against Covid rule violators. The order, issued late on Sunday evening, also demanded deployment of police personnel in three shifts for round-the-clock duty in the centralised war room created at the PCMC administrative building. It also sought creation of an enforcement squad comprising one zonal officer, two staff members of that zone and two police personnel from the Pimpri Chinchwad police commissionerate. This squad has been told to visit the busy markets and intersecting roads in the PCMC limits and take action against errant traders or citizens. Patil has called for increased awareness drive through public announcement about rising cases and the precautions to be taken. Besides, the officials concerned have been directed to monitor patients in home isolation and ensure that they abide by all the home care guidelines. The housing society office-bearers have been told to report names of the patients not following the rules to the civic body. Such errant residents can face action under section 188 of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-to-mark-zones-in-red-orange-yellow-to-show-covid-spread/articleshow/81638820.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Mumbai||Writer-director Sagar Sarhadi passes away at age 87||Sagar Sarhadi, who wrote Yash Chopra’s sumptuous ode to romance, ‘Kabhi Kabhie’, and also directed ‘Bazaar’, a heart-breaking document on the ugly linkage between poverty, marriage and market, passed away at his residence in Mumbai on Sunday night. He was 87. “He wasn’t keeping well for some time and had even stopped eating,” his nephew, filmmaker Ramesh Talwar (‘Doosara Aadmi’, ‘Baseraa’), told PTI. The writer formed an enduring association with Chopra, authoring the screenplay of the much talked-about flop (‘Silsila’) and penning blockbusters such as ‘Noorie’ and ‘Chandni’ (dialogue). The relationship was formed after Chopra saw ‘Mirza Sahiban’, a Sarhadi play on the Indo-Pak war. He was invited to watch it by Talwar, then an assistant to Chopra. ‘Kabhi Kabhie’ followed. ‘Tanhaii’, ‘Bhagat Singh Di Wapsi’ and ‘Bhookha Bhajan Na Hoye Gopala’ are some of his acclaimed works as a playwright. Originally named Ganga Sagar Talwar, Sarhadi was born in Baffa, a picture-postcard village near Abbottabad, in undivided India. He took on the surname Sarhadi, from director Zia Sarhadi who had impressed him with his progressive social films (Footpath, Hum Log), and because he himself came from the frontiers. “Noorie had the same background as my village,” he told Guftagoo, a Rajya Sabha tv show in 2018. Uprooted by Partition, his family came to Delhi via Srinagar. As refugees, they lived in tents before finding a home in the capital’s Mori Gate area, where he completed his matriculation. “There is anger in me. I want to know about those in power who make you leave your own village and make refugees out of people,” he said in the same interview. Later he moved to Bombay, graduated in English from St Xavier’s and worked as an Urdu translator in a British firm. He quit because he wanted to be a professional writer. Sarhadi had strong Left leanings, loved reading Karl Marx and was associated with the Progressive Writers Association. ‘Bazaar’ (1982), which he wrote and directed, was markedly different from the romances that had earned him fame and fortune. “I was becoming repetitive and mechanical. What else can you do in a fantasy factory?...I made a film I believed in,” he told TOI back in 1986. The film was a critical and commercial success. Pirated video cassettes even found their way to Pakistan. Sarhadi also directed ‘Tere Shaher Mein’ which linked justice to privilege, ‘Agla Mausam,’ which showed how feudalism lurks, and, more recently, ‘Chausar’ (2018). These movies were either not released or sparsely viewed. Among those who paid tribute to him on social media were writer Javed Akhtar, lyricist Manoj Muntashir, director Anubhav Sinha and actor Hrithik Roshan. Sarhadi wrote the dialogues of ‘Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai’, Roshan’s debut film, and of ‘Deewana’, Shah Rukh Khan’s first box-office smash. Actor Shabana Azmi tweeted, “He will be remembered by his work both in theatre n films notable amongst them #Tanhaii n #Bazaar. He drew his inspiration from life, travelled by bus n train bcoz he was a writer of d masses. We at IPTA have lost a family member.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/writer-director-sagar-sarhadi-passes-away-at-age-87/articleshow/81639548.cms||Avijit Ghosh

On Monday, the market streets were again filled with people and vendors who were not following proper Covid-19 safety protocols. “I had been to the Main Road in the old city area today morning to buy a gift for my son, whose birthday was on Saturday. I was surprised to see people roaming around without masks or wearing it on the chin,” said Trupti Kale, a home-maker. Prathamesh Gore, who wasn’t wearing a mask, said that they had to closely examine the goods they want to purchase and were therefore handling items in the shops. When asked if he had a sanitizer with him, Gore said he didn’t care much about it. Vivek Pathak was also taken aback when he saw cart vendors and customers failing to maintain social distancing. “While some people would pull up masks on and off, social distancing was absolutely thrown to the wind,” Pathak said. Shopkeepers said that they could not restrict customers or would lose business. “I cannot stop customers for not wearing masks and for breaking distancing. They will go to the next shop and I will lose the business,” said a store owner. He and three of his employees were wearing masks and had placed sanitiser as well. “The customers can use it if they want,” he added. It may be noted that the Nashik district collector Suraj Mandhare has warned that the establishments violating the norms would face closure till the notification on Covid was withdrawn. NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav and commissioner of police Deepak Pandey are also conducting surprise checks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/masks-distancing-missing-as-markets-open-after-2-days/articleshow/81637018.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

During the Covid review meeting on Thursday, state agriculture minister Dada Bhuse, who is also the MLA from Malegaon Outer assembly constituency, had said the situation in Malegaon town is worrisome with a positivity rate at 61%. The minster had asked the municipal corporation commissioner Deepak Kasar, who was on the leave, to resume immediately. The commissioner has resumed the office accordingly. “The number of tests has been increased and the positivity rate of the Covid patients has come down to less than 48%,” said Sapna Thakre, the chief medical officer of Malegaon. The Malegaon corporation has taken up various measures to ensure the number of covid testing facilities and the treatment facilities were increased substantially. “As on Monday, we have 17 testing centres across the corporation with four new ones started in some parts. But the testing has very less or no response in the same areas. However, the intensification of testing people from other areas has resulted in lowering of the positivity rate,” the officer said. Over 300 tests are being done per day while the number of cases is hovering around 150. The district administration has also asked the corporation to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a laboratory to conduct Covid tests, for which, Rs 2 crore have also been provided. Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare said the funds have been provided so that the Malegaon corporation can take measures required to increase testing. The city has 894 active patients, of them, 200 are admitted it the various Covid facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/positivity-rate-drops-below-48-in-malegaon/articleshow/81637012.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Two men snatched a gold chain worth Rs 30,000 at Bhosari in the morning. In the night, a snatcher struck at Chinchwad and robbed a woman of two gold chains worth Rs 1 lakh. “In last two months, as many as 14 chain snatching cases have happened in Pimpri Chinchwad area and only four have been detected so far,” an officer from the Pimpri Chinchwad crime branch told TOI. The Bhosari incidence happened around 6 am, when a woman (38) from Dighi Road and her friend were on a walk. Two men on a motorcycle snatched her gold chain worth Rs 30,000 and rode away. The second chain snatching happened near Talera Hospital in Chinchwad around 8.15pm, when a woman (59) was on a post-dinner walk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gold-chains-worth-rs-1-3l-snatched/articleshow/81638816.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Seven Haryana dists will have zero availability of groundwater: Report||CHANDIGARH: Seven districts in Haryana will have zero availability of groundwater in future as the state is over extracting water by 138.91%, according to a report by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), prepared on the basis of a survey in 2017. The situation is likely to worsen as CGWB is compiling details of surveys carried out last year. Scientists said preliminary findings suggest water levels have dropped from four metres to 14 metres. Reports suggest the state has only 10.15 billion cubic metres (BCM) of groundwater. Gurugram, Faridabad, Palwal and Mahendergarh are the four NCR districts, while the remaining three are Fatehabad, Kaithal, and Sirsa. Kaithal has 227% “over extraction” of water, followed by 220% in Gurugram, 197% in Sirsa, 187% in Palwal, 161% in Fatehabad, 125% in Faridabad and 106% in Mahendergarh. The report said of the 128 blocks of the state, only 26 were found to be safe when it came to groundwater availability. Also, 78 were found to have been overexploited, 21 were semi-critical and three were found to be critical. Rapid urbanisation and unchecked exploitation are said to be behind the trend in Gurugram. For 10 years, the government has even banned the digging of borewell without permission by private colonisers and developers.Paddy- and cotton-sowing areas have been found to be responsible for the overdrawing water in Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Karnal, Sirsa and Fatehabad. The state government, in January this year, set up the Haryana Water Resources (Conservation, Regulation and Management) Authority headed by former chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora. “Saline water too has emerged as a major threat. Government has made a two-pronged approach: one, asking paddy farmers to go for crop diversification; and two, programmes for recharging groundwater and encouraging rainwater harvesting in urban areas,” said an official. Naresh Yadav, former MLA of Ateli who has been spearheading agitations for water in southern Haryana, said the state had been fighting for three decades, “Had the government woken up in time, this situation would not have arisen. Even now, we are pressing for completion of Satluj-Yamuna link canal as this lift system will not be feasible for long.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/report-7-haryana-dists-will-have-zero-availability-of-groundwater/articleshow/81639549.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Kochi||Kerala may see rise in Covid cases by April-end: Experts||KOCHI: Even as ten states in India see a spike in Covid cases, Kerala has once again reached a plateau phase. Health authorities are concerned that instead of seeing a decline in cases, the state may again see a rise in cases after the plateau phase, especially with the second wave of Covid across the country and increased public activity due to the upcoming assembly elections in the first week of April. Kerala’s seven-day average daily growth rate has come down to 0.17%, which is lower than India’s seven-day average daily growth rate of 0.32%. There were several weeks when Kerala’s seven-day average daily growth rate was much higher than India’s average. Punjab has seen the fastest Covid growth with seven-day average daily growth rate of 1.07%, followed by Maharashtra with 0.99% and Chandigarh 0.82%. In all major states, except Kerala, the daily number of cases are increasing. In Maharashtra, the weekly cases reported have increased by 188%. In Haryana and Punjab, the increase in cases over the last one month is 300%. Besides rise in cases, test positivity rate (TPR) is above 5% in majority of states now. Over the last few weeks, state on an average is reporting 1,800 to 2,200 cases per day. TPR also continues to be below 5%, with a seven-day average TPR at 3.5%. Tamil Nadu or Karnataka witnessed a decline in number of cases reported per day at around 500 or less after a spike in cases during the first wave. However, Kerala’s caseload has never seen a real decline after the national lockdown was lifted and interstate and international travel was permitted. “There is no definitive answer for why Kerala has not seen a real drop in cases when compared to many other states. One probable reason is that our testing continues to be high due to which we remain in the plateau phase. The concern is that after the plateau phase we will see an increase and not decline in cases,” said health economist Rijo M John. After the spike in cases post-Onam, there was a slight decline in cases. By December end, we reached a plateau for some time. Again, the cases started to increase and TPR remained very high. Going by Kerala’s Covid trend and with elections and festival season around the corner, experts’ fear that Kerala may again see a surge in cases by April-end. “People in large cities in other states were affected during the first Covid wave . In the second wave, cases are spiking more in smaller towns and villages. But in Kerala there is no such demarcation and after a late peaking, where cases were recorded across the state, now we are seeing a slow decline. But this decline can be temporary,” said Dr Jayakrishnan A V, chairman of Indian Medical Association’s committee for vaccination promotion and coordination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-may-see-rise-in-covid-cases-by-april-end-experts/articleshow/81638818.cms||Preetu Nair

A local court has ordered the prosecution of 11 policemen and one driver in the 2015 case where a resident of adjoining Kalawad town, accused in a forgery case, was allegedly tortured and threatened of being framed if he did not pay them Rs 50,000. The second additional chief judicial magistrate Prakash Khubchand Khanchandani in his order noted there is prima facie evidence of the allegation made by victim Afzal Dodhiya, which is enough to initiate the process of prosecution against the cops. The order was passed after completion of inquiry into the complaint filed by Dodhiya who had registered a court complaint when he was produced before the court in September 2015.. Dodhiya was accused under IPC sections 465 (forgery), 466 (forgery of court record) and others. According to his complaint, policemen from Kalawad police station had come to his house on the night of September 10, 2015 and asked him why he did not come to the police station to record his statement. Dodhiya said when he went to the police station the next day morning, he was allegedly asked to pay Rs 50,000 and the cops threatened to frame him in the FIR lodged against him. When he said he didn’t have money, he was allegedly thrashed by cops and taken to Panchkoshi A-division police station at around 3.30am. He also accused the cops of giving him electric shock and forcing him to pay Rs 50,000 or admit his crime. Dodhiya alleged that before taking him to the court the next day, he was threatened not to speak anything about ‘torture’ before the judge else he would be made ‘impotent’ during the remand period. The court considered the statement of the complainant's family members and medical report. Dodhiya’s advocate, Nikhil Buddhbhatti, told TOI: “The court ordered for a medical report and thereafter the case was reported to the sessions court. The inquiry held and complaint, witness and doctor’s statement and evidence were recorded. Based on this evidence, the court ordered prosecution of these cops.” Those who will face prosecution are then police sub-inspectors (PSI) Bantva, PSI Vichhi, constables Gautam Makwana, Shailendrasinh of D-staff, Hasmukh and Jaysukh of Kalawad police station and constables Digubha, Vashram Aahir and Yashpalsinh, PSI Chaudhary, writer Bhikha and a driver Jani of A-division police station. They will be booked relevant IPC sections pertaining to extortion, custodial torture to force confession and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/11-cops-to-be-booked-in-2015-custodial-torture-case/articleshow/81637802.cms||---
---||Kochi||Nomination rejections: HC declines to interfere||Kochi: The high court, on Monday, dismissed petitions filed by three NDA candidates challenging rejection of their nomination papers on Saturday. However, the court also asked the election commission to ensure uniformity in parameters. After considering the petitions, justice N Nagaresh accepted state election commission’s contention that the court interfering with the election process after election is notified would affect the conduct of free and fair elections. Referring to a Supreme Court judgment of 2000 (Election Commission of India Vs. Ashok Kumar and others) and a high court ruling that bars courts from interfering, the court held, “In view of the judgment of the apex court referred to above and in the light of the judgment of a division bench of this court in Abdulla v. Kerala State Election Commission (2020), this court is not inclined to interfere with the election process at the instance of the petitioners, at this stage.” In the petitions filed on Sunday, NDA candidates contended that the nomination papers were rejected by returning officers due to extraneous considerations. The candidates, who approached the high court, were to contest from Thalassery, Guruvayur, and Devikulam. On Saturday, the nomination papers filed by the candidates were rejected by returning officers citing lapses. Those who were affected were BJP’s N Haridasan and advocate Nivedida Subramanian, who were to contest from Thalassery and Guruvayur. Haridas is BJP’s Kannur district leader whereas Nivedida is state president of Mahila Morcha. The Form-A submitted by Haridas allegedly lacked the signature of BJP national president and had only the seal. Through this form, the party national chief authorizes the party’s state leader to allocate the election symbol to the candidate. Nivedida’s nomination papers were allegedly rejected as the party state chief’s letter (Form B) endorsing her as the official candidate was filed late. Both candidates had contended that the returning officer acted without jurisdiction and ignored the rule (Rule 4 of Conduct of Election Rules) that defects in Form A or B are not fatal to the nomination. The returning officer’s action is unauthorized and arbitrary, it was alleged. The candidates had also contended that returning officers in some constituencies are allowing candidates with defects in Form A or B to file nomination papers while it is not allowed in some other constituencies, resulting in selective application of law. Noting that the election commission itself has the power to correct errors and deficiencies, the court said election commission should ensure uniformity in implementing parameters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nomination-rejections-hc-declines-to-interfere/articleshow/81638834.cms||---

Even with the daily passenger traffic coming down drastically, we have been forced to run increased number of buses during the peak morning and evening hours. Buses cannot run without conductors. We are currently falling short of around 500 conductors and trying to find a way to cope,” a senior Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) official said. Officials of the PMPML stated that they were looking into the option of cancelling the leaves of drivers and conductors to maintain normal operations. At present, 1,600 buses are in operation in adherence to the 50% capacity cap. “There are around 4,200 conductors working with the PMPML. With the seating capacity decreased, we have had to increase the number of buses so that all commuters can access buses on time. Each bus needs three conductors,” the official said. The official also said, around 150 drivers and conductors were recently shifted to the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation offices in view of the rise in Covid-19 cases. The daily passenger traffic of around 8-9 lakh per day a month ago is currently hovering around the 5 lakh-mark. “On Sunday, our income was just Rs70 lakh. Just a month ago, we had crossed the Rs1 crore-mark in daily income,” another official said. Traffic manager Dattatray Zende of the PMPML told TOI that talks were on to implement different options to increase the number of conductors. “One option is to cancel all leaves for sometime and request the conductors and drivers to take only their designated weekly-offs. However, for that, we need a nod from the unions. The board of directors’ meeting of the transport body is scheduled to be held soon and the plan to recruit more conductors should get approved then. Once that happens, the process will be started immediately,” the senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-faces-shortage-of-bus-conductors-amid-increased-ops-dwindling-passenger-count/articleshow/81638840.cms||Joy Sengupta

A bulk of the passengers were devotees headed to the famous Shirdi Sai Baba temple.Airport director Deepak Shastri had earlier confirmed that the construction of the new terminal building has been deferred by the state government. “The detailed project report was done, but the pandemic hit just before the approval was to be given,” he said.In the state budget for 2021-22, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who also holds the finance portfolio, had announced that the air traffic control tower would get an upgrade to allow night landing at the airport, a demand that was made since the airport began in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shirdi-airport-gets-nod-for-cargo-transport-perishables-first-in-line/articleshow/81638836.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Enrolment for April HSC exam drops by over 1 lakh||PUNE: The enrolment for the higher secondary certificate (HSC, Std XII) examination for April this year has fallen by over one lakh when compared with last year’s data. Enrolment statistics from the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education show that 13.1 lakh students have registered online for the exam. Last year, the numbers stood at 14.2 lakh. The drop is seen in all nine divisions of the state board — Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Nashik, Amravati, Latur, Kolhapur and Konkan. Attributing the reduced enrolment to the Covid-19 situation, education experts said many students may have opted for a gap year as schools and colleges had barely opened and coaching classes remained shut for a long period, affecting exam preparations necessary for future careers. The new academic year began with classes going online. In November, some places in Maharashtra started offline classes for board students, but abandoned them again when Covid-19 cases began increasing in March. This, experts said, may have led many students to have concerns about adequate exam preparations. The state board said the drop in enrolment could be a domino effect of the poor pass percentage (77.10) in the secondary school certificate (SSC, Std X) exam in 2019. The pass percentage had fallen by 12.31% over the previous year, the biggest drop in the board’s history. Since fewer students passed that year, there would be fewer students coming up for HSC in 2021. State board chairman Dinkar Patil said, “In 2019, the results of the SSC exam were poor. There was a drop in the pass percentage which has had repercussions this year. Two years on, those students are in HSC and hence there is a drop in enrolment.” However, there is an increase in enrolment by nearly 16,000 over last year for the SSC examination in some divisions. As many as 16 lakh students have enrolled this year as against 15.8 lakh students last year. But, low enrolment has been reported from Nagpur, Aurangabad, Amravati, Latur and Konkan divisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hsc-exam-enrolment-drops-by-over-1l/articleshow/81638850.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The results were announced on March 21 by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. “I was expecting to get good scores, but I never thought I would bag the second rank in the country,” said Hariharan, a student of RA Podar College. He secured 601 out of 800 marks in the CA exam (new course). Eleven marks short, Hariharan’s second position follows first ranker Bhramar Jain from Raipur, who secured 611 in the exam that was conducted in January this year. Vaibhav told TOI that he was inspired by Raj Seth, also from Dombivli, who had had secured the first rank in the CA final exam in the country in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-dombivli-youth-secures-second-rank-in-country-in-ca-final-exam/articleshow/81639571.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Ahmedabad||‘Bricks used in IIM-Ahmedabad campus were of first class’||India’s famed structural engineer, Mahendra Raj, who has worked on several projects that shaped the country’s modern architecture after Independence, shares his views on the recent controversy involving IIM-A’s plans to raze dormitories. The portfolio of Raj, now 96, includes Tagore Memorial Hall and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad; and the Hall of Nations at Pragati Maidan in Delhi. For the creation of IIM-A, he was the advisor to the structural team. The IIM-A’s red-brick campus is considered a masterpiece of Louis Kahn. The dorms on the campus had been recently deemed unsafe by IIM-A. Raj told TOI on Saturday that the IIM-A’s main campus can be saved with proper conservation. Excerpts: What are your views on the controversy over IIM-A’s demolition plans? When the dormitories were being built, they were designed to withstand earthquake forces as specified in the codes of that time. More than 50 years later, the buildings do need proper maintenance. I do not agree that the dormitories should be dismantled. Extensive restoration should be provided if needed. ‘Second-class bricks’ were cited to abandon conservation efforts for the dorms. I do not agree. The bricks used across the entire campus of IIM-A were of the first class. The 2001 earthquake is said to have caused extensive damage to the main campus. Are these dorms safe?If the library (Vikram Sarabhai Library) could be restored successfully and win an award (from Unesco for restoration in 2019), then in my opinion it should be possible to restore the dormitories as well. A structural consultant told IIM-A that the restored Dorm-15 is unsafe. But the structural consultant of the conservation architect said the dorm will resist moderate earthquakes. It was said that the library will withstand a severe earthquake with minor damage. What do you make of these appraisals?I have not visited the IIM-A campus for a number of years. If there is a difference of opinion between two structural engineers, I would suggest that the buildings be inspected by a panel of minimum three structural engineers. How are the Kahn buildings relevant today?Some structures reflect the technology and culture of the time they were built in and attract worldwide attention. The IIM-A campus designed by Prof Louis Kahn falls into that category. The campus has been studied extensively by students of architecture and engineering since it was built in 1960s-1970s. It has attracted worldwide attention and has made significant contributions to the professions of architecture and engineering. Also, the campus is one of the most significant contributions of Prof Kahn as an architect and an important indication of the Indian engineering talent available at that time. How do you view the decision to demolish the Hall of Nations and IIM-A’s razing proposal?As I have stated earlier, some of these buildings made a significant contribution to architecture and engineering. As they became important markers of a time, these iconic buildings also made the nation proud. IIM-A and the Hall of Nations in Delhi fall in this category. IIM-A aside, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium (Navrangpura) is being restored. As a professional associated with both, what’s your prognosis? My contribution to the design of IIM-A was limited. I was an advisor to the structural team set up by National Institute of Design. In the case of the stadium, I was the prime engineering consultant and Charles Correa was the architect. The stadium is considered an iconic building. The World Monuments Fund selected it as a ‘2020 World Monuments Watch Site’. I am proud of my contribution to the making of these buildings. Like IIM-A, the stadium is more than 50 years old and would need maintenance and restoration. The World Monuments Fund has been awarded a Getty Foundation grant to develop a conservation report/proposal for the stadium in collaboration with local experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bricks-used-in-iim-a-campus-were-of-first-class/articleshow/81641019.cms||Maulik Pathak

---||Kochi||Gold smuggling case: Bail pleas of Swapna Suresh, six others dismissed||KOCHI: An NIA special court in Kochi on Monday dismissed the bail pleas of Swapna Suresh and six other accused in the gold smuggling case. Special court judge Kamanees K considered the bail pleas of 2nd accused Swapna, 10th accused Rabins Hameed, 6th accused Jalal AM, 12th accused Muhammed Ali, 13th accused Sharafuddeen KT, 1st accused Sarith PS, 7th accused Mohammed Shafi P, and 5th accused Ramees KT. Swapna had contended that offence under UAPA is not attracted against her and that she has legitimate sources regarding the money and gold ornaments seized from the bank lockers. It was contended by NIA that the offences are prima facie attracted. The accused are economically well-off and have associations with entities in the UAE and other Middle Eastern countries that are inimical to the economic security of India. Major parts of the transactions were conducted in UAE, the court was told. Involvement of a foreign source cannot be ruled out and further investigation is still going on, especially regarding the reverse hawala aspects of the case by which profit generated had been pushed back to unknown sources, NIA submitted. Opposing Sarith’s plea, NIA had submitted that the incriminating role played by him has been revealed in the investigation. Regarding 6th accused Jalal’s plea, NIA had said he conspired and this has been established through call records. On 12th accused Mohammed Ali, the NIA had argued that his being part of conspiracy was corroborated by witness statements. Incriminating materials related to banned terrorist organizations were found in the gadgets seized from his possession, the court was told. NIA had informed the court that 13th accused Sharafuddeen KT had accompanied 5th accused Ramees KT to Tanzania and Congo and investigation is going on. Ramees is one of the main conspirators, NIA had submitted. Rabins Hameed, the 10th accused, took part in conspiracy and financing of the gold smuggling, NIA submitted. No objection was filed by NIA against 7th accused Muhammed Shafi P’s bail plea. In the order, the court said prosecution has shown accused no. 1, 2, 5 and 10 as principal conspirators and has presented prosecutable evidence. There are materials about the alleged conspiracy by accused no. 6 and 12, the court said. There is evidence that accused no. 13 accompanied accused no. 5 to Tanzania. Bail application of accused no. 7 is for default bail but it cannot be considered as final report has been filed within the statutory period, the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bail-pleas-of-swapna-six-others-dismissed/articleshow/81638864.cms||---
---||Nagpur||MLA seeks action against Maha Bamboo Board ex-MD||NAGPUR: Even as senior IPS officer Parambir Singh has stirred up a controversy by making allegations against home minister Anil Deshmukh, five-time NCP MLA from Majalgaon in Beed district Prakash Solanke has demanded action against former managing director of Maharashtra Bamboo Development Board (MBDB) TSK Reddy. Talking to TOI, Solanke said, “Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of police should probe all financial and other irregularities during the tenure of Reddy as MD. During the budget session, I had raised the issue in the House. I will follow up the issue with EOW.” Solanke said there are large-scale irregularities and diversion of National Bamboo Mission (NBM) funds received by MBDB. The board implemented a scheme for bamboo plantation under NBM where the maximum limit per beneficiary is Rs50,000 and there is a provision for 600 saplings per hectare. “Beneficiaries are required to purchase saplings and carry out plantation. They are required to furnish invoices of the saplings to MBDB for claiming subsidy. The board is required to do a direct benefit transfer (DBT) of the subsidy amount to the beneficiaries bank account. However, MBDB violated all rules and directly procured bamboo saplings for an amount of over Rs4.29 crore,” said the MLA. Solanke added the bamboo board provided saplings to the forest department in violation of guidelines. As per NBM norms, bamboo plantations are to be done only on agricultural land and non-forests land, but over 2.20 lakh saplings worth Rs55 lakh were provided free of cost to Gondia forest division and over 1 lakh saplings worth Rs25 lakh were provided to one Rajshekhar Patil free of cost. Solanke said, “Section 2(7) of the Indian Forest Act (IFA) was amended in 2017 to exclude bamboo from the definition of forest produce. This was done to encourage bamboo plantation by farmers in order to double farmers’ income by 2022. However, the MBDB failed miserably.” The MBDB also violated Forest Conservation Act (FCA), 1980, by starting units in Gorewada reserve forest under the garb of research & development unit. However, FCA doesn’t give any such exemption for non-forestry activities. Solanke further said the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) issued closure direction under Section 33A of Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 & Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution Act, 1981 and Hazardous & Other Wastes (Management & Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2018. No consent was taken from MPCB before operating any units in the state. Solanke further demanded that permission should be granted by secretary (labour) to director, Industrial Safety and Health, for the prosecution of Reddy under provisions of Rule 4 (4), Rule 65 (6) (iii) (a) and Rule 65 (6) (iii) (b) of Maharashtra Factories Rules, 1963m at an early date. The proposal for prosecution is pending with the secretary (labour), since December 2020. Bamboo consultant and AAP leader Pratap Goswami said, “The irregularities in bamboo board runs into crores of rupees. Even the state-level executive committee (SLEC), constituted under chief secretary to implement the NBM objectives, turned a blind eye to all violations. This is one of the main reasons why the bamboo mission has failed in the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mla-seeks-action-against-maha-bamboo-board-ex-md/articleshow/81636403.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||Covid-19 death toll in Mumbai and Maharashtra rises once again, slowly but steadily||MUMBAI: A marginal but steady rise has been reported in Covid-19 deaths in the city and the state over the past few weeks. Though the daily toll is nowhere close to the September-October peak, hospitals have seen more fatalities in March than January and February. An analysis of the public health department’s figures shows in January, Maharashtra saw 310-370 deaths in a week. It fell in February to 228 in the first week, 219 in the second and 259 in the third. The number rose again in the fourth week to 366 fatalities, came down to 324 in the first week of March only to soar in the second week to 389 and rise exponentially to 538 in the third. Compared to 1,072 in February, the state thus recorded 1,303 deaths in the 22 days of March. In September 2020, it recorded over 12,000 deaths. Mumbai’s graph is similar to the state’s. Deaths in January were in the range of 46-52 every week. Weekly mortality numbers dropped to 27-40 in February, before starting to climb again in March. From 29 in the first week, it rose to 31 in the second and 51 in the third week. Deaths in the 22 days of March (121) are close to February’s toll of 127. Sion Hospital’s ICU which was registering 2-3 deaths in February and most of January are now seeing up to 10 deaths in a week. Intensivist Dr Trupti Trivedi said barring two young patients, including one afflicted by TB, they have mostly lost elderly patients with comorbidities. The volume of referrals has increased at the civic-run SevenHills Hospital, Marol too. “From a handful of critical cases, we are back to getting 12-13 very serious patients referred from other civic and private hospitals,” said dean Dr Deepak Adsul, adding that the weekly death rate is now hovering around 10%. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said in the light of rising casualties, ward level staffers have been asked to closely follow up on patients in home quarantine. However, he added “the rise in deaths is not worrying at present as the case fatality rate is less than 0.50%.” Another official reiterated that the state’s CFR was 0.32% in the third week of March, a much better situation than September’s CFR of 2%. Dr Trivedi said the daily count of 10-odd deaths in Mumbai may double in weeks to come. “Hence, it’s critical for doctors to advise people with symptoms to get tested and treated on time,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaicovid-19-death-toll-in-city-and-state-rises-once-again-slowly-but-steadily/articleshow/81639576.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The tribunal said ownership of the issue may now be taken over by the respective chief secretaries, who were asked to personally monitor progress of compliance at least once a month, besides evolving an appropriate administrative mechanism to handle the situation. During the hearing, the tribunal was informed that most of the existing sewerage treatment plants (STPs) do not meet parameters set for faecal coliform, a bacteria which indicates faecal contamination of water. The NGT principal bench, headed by chairman Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel asked the chief secretaries to focus on timely completion of ongoing works. It said further action on the basis of recommendations of the NGT-appointed monitoring committee would help restore the river. It directed acceptance of recommendations of the monitoring committee and further action on that basis. “As river Ghaggar flows inter-state, its water quality is required to be maintained at least of ‘C’ category, when it finally enters in the state of Rajasthan,” it added. On pollution of Ghaggar, the NGT said the monitoring committee report shows huge gaps in capacity and functioning of STPs, common effluent treatment plants and effluent treatment plants. It said states concerned need to take remedial action for disposal of biomedical waste, compliance of solid waste management rules, 2016, preparation of maps and zoning of flood plains, mining activity under supervision of authorities concerned and in-situ remediation. STPs need to be duly maintained and comply with the faecal coli form standards, it said. Underlining the need to set up CCTV cameras, monitoring stations, creation of awareness and conduct of health check-ups, apart from other administrative measures as suggested by the committee, the NGT said it requires sustained efforts at different levels of the administration, local bodies, district administration and the state. Maintaining that monitoring by the tribunal or a tribunal-appointed committee cannot be a permanent feature, the NGT bench clarified that this could only be the last resort for some time. It was up to the states to take stern measures and evolve an effective monitoring mechanism to provide clean environment to citizens and protect natural resources, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/tribunal-puts-onus-on-3-states-chief-secys-to-monitor-ghaggar-pollution/articleshow/81639568.cms||Anand Bodh

Patil held a review meeting with Kolhapur authorities on the backdrop of steady rise in Covid cases across the district. “Implementing Covid rules is the only way to tackle the crisis and lockdown like extreme measures are not possible given the change in the mindset of the citizens,” he said. “Covid cases are rising in the district though not at an alarming rate. However, we have to ensure the rise is slowed down at any cost. The authorities must ensure that all kinds of establishments follow “No mask, No entry’ rule and other guidelines strictly. The initiative was first launched by Kolhapur administration and then the state followed it and made it mandatory across the state,” he added. He also showed his disappointment over the slow rate of vaccine administration, to which the officials claimed they have set the target of March 31 to complete the vaccination of senior citizens and citizens with comorbidity. Sanjaysinha Chavan, CEO of Kolhapur ZP, said, “We have asked health authorities to ensure 100% vaccination of the senior citizens and citizens with comorbidity by the month-end. We have requested to the youth to take the elderly from the locality to nearby centres for vaccination. The turnout has increased in recent days due to rising awareness.” District collector Daulat Desai said that directions have been issued to local authorities especially to avoid gatherings at the restaurants and bars. Shailesh Balkawade, district police superintendent, said the citizens should follow rules to avoid lockdown or curfew in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/implement-no-mask-no-entry-rule-strictly-satej-patil/articleshow/81637063.cms||---

The unheralded success stories of rural India’s ‘jal jodhas’ (water warriors) were shared in a webinar on World Water Day, which highlighted report on villages that have made the transformation from drought to prosperity. The findings of a countrywide survey of the impacts of MGNREGA after 15 years of its implementation were released on Monday. The reports were filed from 16 villages in 15 states. “Finding the villages which had successfully executed MGNREGA was difficult as no records are kept of the sustainability of the works. The government only keeps a record of the number of works done, and of whether they have been completed. What is not known is if the structure built under MGNREGA has improved the water security of the village or contributed to livelihood improvements,” said CSE director general Sunita Narain The districts covered included Ananthapuramu (Andhra Pradesh), Jalaun (Uttar Pradesh), Tikamgarh and Sidhi (Madhya Pradesh), Balangir (Odisha), Pakur (Jharkhand), Bankura (West Bengal), Kaimur (Bihar), Jalna (Maharashtra), Palakkad (Kerala), Nagapattinam (Tamil Nadu), Dungarpur (Rajasthan), Sirsa (Haryana), Chitradurga (Karnataka), Ranga Reddy (Telangana) and Sabarkantha in (Gujarat). Narain said, “With climate change, we will see more rain and more heat, and in this, the management of water will be our make or break. Water security is also crucial for livelihood security. It builds resilience and the ability to cope with weather adversities. The MGNREGA is the world’s largest social security and climate risk management programme.” DTE managing editor Richard Mahapatra said, “One of the big findings of the report is that villages have reaped economic and environmental benefits of water conservation works defying all odds. This has only been possible due to the persistence and diligence of water warriors in villages.” Full report on www.toi.in “MGNREGA is also the country’s largest water conservation exercise. The governments must now measure the potential harvested of these instruments. For this, it must turn its focus to track the impacts of water harvesting structures. As government data shows half of water structures are either left unfinished or turn defunct after a few years due to lack of maintenance. This is a wasted opportunity,” Mahapatra added. Sirsa example Barokhan village in Sirsa district of Haryana has been using MGNREGA labour to build systems to recycle grey water for irrigation. The village has built three-pond system to treat waste water from kitchens and bathrooms. The ponds, built under MGNREGA, are adjacent to each other, along the gradient of the land, and connected via pipes. Grey water of villages Barokhan, Bhavdeen and Jasania gets cleaned due to settlement of impurities as it moves down successive ponds. The villagers manage to save up to 66% on water charges and have reduced their dependence on groundwater too. Water assets created As per government records, since 2006 more than 30 million water conservation-related ecological assets have been created; this comes to 50 water structures in every village of India. Calculations show that these structures have potentially conserved roughly 29,000 million cubic meters of water in this period and have the potential to irrigate some 19 million hectares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/villagers-using-mgnrega-for-drought-relief/articleshow/81639584.cms||Neel Kamal

Against 3,036 active infections on Sunday, the number went up to 3,398 on Monday which is a clear jump of over 10%. Alongside, a marginal decline in the state’s overall Covid-19 recovery rate has been recorded. The recovery rate has gone down from 98.25% last week to 98% now. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said that the both the trends were directly linked to the rise in number of cases over past few days. “The next few days are very crucial for UP to maintain its edge over the virus. The situation is changing very fast in many states and prevention efforts by every person in UP will count,” he said. According to the official bulletin on Covid-19, the 542 cases were reported in the past 24 hours taking the total to 6,08,076. This is the highest since January 14. Also, with 177 fresh entries, the total number of recovered persons reached 5,95,920. Prasad also stated that in a number of districts, especially in rural areas, migrant workers who have returned home for festive season are the new cases which make the role of gram and mohallah nigrani samitis more important. “In a number of districts, the new cases comprise people and migrants who work in other states and have come back for the festival. Anyone coming back home must get themselves tested for the pandemic infection these days,” Prasad said, reiterating that testing is done free of cost in UP. Officials also said that the even though vaccination programme has started, the risk of loss of life due to the coronavirus infection remains the same. The total number of lives lost due to Covid-19 till now reached 8,760 with one new entry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/active-infections-upby-10-in-24-hours/articleshow/81640323.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||Thiruvananthapuram||A tough contest on the cards here||Thiruvananthapuram: On a steamy afternoon, Kadakampally Surendran, who eyes a consecutive term at Kazhakkoottam, steps onto an all wheel drive red-painted open jeep. He is surrounded by noise, colour and crowd. Festoons and flags bridge the electric posts. A gaggle of youths move around uneasily. Announcers in multiple vehicles vainly try to outdo the ear-piercing howls from the speakers. Then silence descends. Surendran says he has kept his promises. He assures more if they give a second chance. When he attacks the Centre, saying, “Let’s tell them this is a land of peace and harmony and is not meant for religious fanatics,” the crowd loves it. He concludes his speech, leans forward to collect a flower from a kid and moves on. His words come out with measure and caution. A few days ago he had sounded remorseful about Sabarimala events and he had a handful to regret later on. With no one to shelter him, he had appeared like a kid, nearly kicked out of house for his mischief. He had unwittingly dropped a spark to set off a bushfire at the most inopportune time. Surendran, usually known to play down emotions, like he had demonstrated during Ockhi, had pulled out Sabarimala issue from cold storage and left it to defrost and heat up. BJP has planted an ideal woman contender to feed off the slip and stoke the flame. Sobha Surendran, who had a cinematic, high-pitched launch to her campaign from Karyavattam Ayyappa temple, has been ruthless on Surendran. She calls him a betrayer, likens him to the demonic Poothana and looks like she has hardly started. “Sabarimala is not about politics. He won the votes of these people and hurt them badly. He can repent but that doesn’t mean he will go unpunished. This election will make him pay for what he has done to beliefs,” says Sobha, who starts off her day at Pallithura on Monday. There are key voters and their families whom she meets and takes her time in their houses. “This is one of the places where we are still growing,” she says. She pats on the back of the youths and whispers to them, “Do good work, we will win here”. A nervous group of party workers are hastily arranging their booth ahead of her arrival. There is no time to lose. “Although there was a delay in candidate announcement, her arrival has given us hope,” a party worker says. Facing her eighth election, she speaks in numbers and says she believes in them. She is known to have doubled the votes of her predecessors in constituencies be it in Attingal LS election or Palakkad assembly election in the past. She says she faces 124 cases related to protests at Sabarimala. “The delay in candidature has not affected our prospects. We have a clear mission for Kazhakkoottam, this is the mini India with people from all parts of India being employed in the IT sector. We ought to give them the development they deserve,” she says. The seasoned contenders of CPM and BJP believe they can run over Congress candidate Dr S S Lal. Lal, a renowned public health specialist sticks to disciplined, organized campaign. Moving around the wards, he takes a power nap in his car to deal with sleepless campaign sessions. In a teeming hall filled with white clad partymen at Ulloor, Ramesh Chennithala launches a fierce assault on LDF and poll surveys. He praises S S Lal and says party expects him to deliver. Lal, drawing his experience from college politics, tells them he will win back Kazhakkoottam. The choice of a professional in the constituency had led to mild murmurs of dissent, but party machinery is slowly being oiled back to function. UDF had lost 23% votes between 2011 and 2016 at Kazhakkoottam. “I have a clear vision for Kazhakkoottam. I will keep up the trust the party has placed in me,” Lal says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/a-tough-contest-on-the-cards-here/articleshow/81638949.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Dr Ambedkar University, near Vaishno Devi Circle on SG Highway drew criticism from NSUI members after it organized an event to highlight the importance of Sanskrit language. The event was attended by over 700 people and social distancing norms were flouted, according to NSUI members who took a strong objection to the event on social media platforms. Similarly, other universities in the state are also organizing seminars, workshops and even programmes on performing arts. “The state education department is turning a blind eye to the risks and dangers of Covid-19. By trying to protect the interests of some select college authorities, the government is putting the health of students and professors at risk,” said an official aware of the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/shut-down-yet-colleges-hold-gatherings/articleshow/81641017.cms||---

The bandh call was given by Adivasi Vikas Sangathan to pay tribute to Delkar and bring to justice those who forced the leader to take the extreme step. The roads wore a deserted look in Silvassa and other villages across the union territories as shops, commercial establishments joined the bandh call.Mohan Delkar (58), an independent MP from Dadra and Nagar Haveli, was found hanging by the ceiling fan of his room at a hotel in the Marine Drive area of Mumbai on February 22. He had left behind a suicide note. Mumbai Police had lodged an FIR against the accused including union territory's administrator and former Gujarat home minister Praful Patel and a probe is on. Mohan Delkar had contested as an independent in the 2019 Lok Sabha election and won for the seventh time.According to sources, local BJP unit and union territory administration tried their best to ensure that people do not join in the bandh call but to no avail. A day before, the BJP's Daman unit had also issued a statement asking people not to observe bandh and to continue their routine work.Delkar supporters and tribal leaders organized a public meeting on Monday evening in Silvassa to pay tribute to the departed leader.

---||Mumbai||Door-to-door outreach, street plays planned to boost Dharavi vax drive||MUMBAI: BMC’s first community vaccination effort in the densely populated slum of Dharavi got off to a tepid start on Monday even as 40 fresh Covid cases —the highest single-day count this year —were registered. Only 64 recipients turned up for the Covaxin shot, at BMC’s ‘Chhota Sion Hospital’ urban centre located in Dharavi. One female recipient fainted after vaccination, and was rushed to the nearby Sion Hospital; she was discharged after her condition stabilised. BMC set up five booths at the urban health centre to vaccinate 500 people a day. Approximately 1.7 lakh of the eight lakh population here are senior citizens. However, BMC officials are not disheartened and have drawn up plans to boost the drive by roping in corporators, community health workers (CHWs) and holding street plays. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said first-day turnout for various priority groups (healthcare and frontline workers and senior citizens) has always been low. “It will improve in the coming days,” she added. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government task force on Covid-19, said Dharavi has daily wage earners who cannot drop their work for vaccination. “We should have a different strategy for Dharavi like early morning or late evening vaccination,” he said. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said better turnout is expected on weekends and holidays. Public health expert Dr Ravi Duggal said the poor turnout could be the result of vaccine hesitancy. “People have been discussing side-effects and deaths after vaccination. Also, in crowded slum pockets such as Dharavi, there is a belief that they have already have herd immunity,” added Duggal. Kakani said although sero surveys had shown Covid antibodies among 50% of slumdwellers, these levels deplete over time. “People have to be educated on the need to take vaccines to boost their antibody levels,” he said. BMC has asked local corporators to set up kiosks to help the elderly register on the Co-Win portal. Local corporator TM Jagdish said, “We are distributing pamphlets, sending out WhatsApp and Facebook messages. We hope the response will improve from Tuesday onwards.” Meanwhile, 40 cases were registered on Monday, the highest in almost six months. On May 3, 2020, it had registered its highest ever single-day tally of 95.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaidoor-to-door-outreach-street-plays-planned-to-boost-dharavi-vax-drive/articleshow/81639587.cms||Richa Pinto

It took 29 fire tenders and nearly 150 personnel of Ahmedabad fire and emergency services (AFES) two hours to douse the flames. According to an AFES officer, no injuries or deaths were reported in the incident. However, Around 10 shops were gutted and damage worth lakhs was reported. The incident took place around 5.50pm on Monday when the fire broke out in a shop named Kirti Fridge in Spectrum Tower. The fire spread to few adjacent shops of surgical equipment, said an AFES officer. Earlier 15 fire tenders were sent to douse the fire but 14 more were deployed later, considering the spot where the fire had broken out. “As the area has narrow lanes with shops and houses adjacent to it, the fire could have caused huge damage if not doused at the earliest,” said the fire officer. The traffic movement on Relief Road was also stopped to control the crowd and prevent traffic jams which would have caused problems in fire-fighting. A team of city police was also called in to control the crowd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fire-guts-10-shops-on-relief-road-none-hurt/articleshow/81641029.cms||---

The woman was dead and her husband now faces a case of murder. On Monday, Bapunagar police registered the case against the man after they were called in by the hotel. Bapunagar police inspector A P Gadhvi said the staff of Athithi Guest House in Hatkeshwar have reported that the couple were locked in a quarrel before the incident. Police have not yet been able to determine the circumstances that yielded the gory scene. Gadhvi said prima facie it appears that the man killed his wife and then attempted suicide. The man in question, Mehul Solanki, has undergone a surgery at a city hospital. The deceased has been identified as Yogita Solanki. Bapunagar police said they have been able to establish that the couple were residents of slum quarters in Amraiwadi.

In an exclusive interview with TOI, the senior Congress leader talks about the Sabarimala issue, welfare schemes, Tharoor, and a lot more. ExcerptsCongress has alleged that the pre-poll surveys are part of CPM’s PR work. Are the surveys targeting anyone in particular?The current PR work is targeting opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala because he has brought out the maximum allegations against the LDF government. Don’t all governments try to give maximum publicity to their achievements?Such PR work has never happened when I was the chief minister. There is nothing wrong with displaying the good things of the government. But here it is not like that, they are trying to hide the flaws of the government. Will the Sabarimala issue play a key role in this election?Both NSS and the UDF have a permanent stand on the Sabarimala issue. We stand for the protection of the faith and customs of the devotees. UDF does not want the Sabarimala issue to be made into a controversy. CPM was adamant about bringing women to Sabarimala with police escort. If they had shown some restraint, the issue would not have escalated. Now, they are showing some restraint due to elections. But what they have in mind is different. They even provoked the NSS. Food kits and welfare pensions are considered as the plus points of the LDF government. Will it benefit them?The reality is different. While they gave free kits, they have stopped the free distribution of rice for BPL cardholders that was started by the UDF government. We implemented that within 100 days of the UDF rule and gave it for five years. But the LDF government is charging Rs 2 for a kg of rice. UDF used to give kit during Onam. The LDF government couldn’t do that. Now, they are doing it as they have no other examples to highlight for good governance. When people asked for the kit during Onam, they cited various reasons like the floods, Nipah, etc. Now, they are giving it because they’re in a deep crisis. Shashi Tharoor had played an important role in framing the UDF manifesto. Will he be more involved in state politics?Tharoor is an asset for Congress at the national level. It is the need of the Congress and the people to make maximum use of his service in the state as well as the Centre. The national leadership will have to decide on that. Are the groups in the Congress party satisfied with the candidates’ list?Our candidates are special this time. Most of them are youngsters. Those above 70 are only me and two others. Only in Elathur there was an issue between the Congress and one of its allies. Everything else has been solved. What’s the trend now?UDF victory is sure. The main reason is the flaws and shortcomings of the LDF government. Other than giving advertisements, nothing is being done. Take the case of Idukki, where ‘pattayams’ are given strictly for agriculture. A small house can be constructed on that land, nothing more. They can’t build a school, ration shop, or a place of worship. How can they live like that? If the UDF government comes to power, we will change this rule in a time-bound manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ldf-government-using-pr-to-hide-its-flaws/articleshow/81638954.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

There were instances of people running away from malls when asked to undergo testing. “We had to provide our own staff as visitors were not taking the mall management seriously,” said assistant municipal commissioner Manish Walunju of L (Kurla) ward. The state has ordered at least 400 tests at every mall and citizens will have to pay Rs 250 for the tests. At other crowded places, the tests were free as BMC bore the cost. With tests continuing till the evening, officials said the final numbers are likely to be available on Tuesday. The wards were given a target of 47,800 antigen tests, but officials said it is a tall order considering reluctance among mall-goers as well as staff shortage. The test target for every ward will depend on the number of malls, stations, bus depots in it. BMC personnel were not seen at all the malls. At the popular Infiniti in Malad, only laboratory staff and mall representatives were present. A mall representative in the western suburbs said with no BMC staff provided to help them, there was chaos. “Not many visitors were willing to undergo testing and were turning away, hitting our business. We kept making announcements asking visitors to voluntarily get tested, but the response was cold,” he said. In G-South ward that hosts Phoenix in Lower Parel and Atria Mall in Worli, visitors were being tested outside the premises. “The visitors needed to wait till the test reports were out. In case of anyone testing positive, the ward war room was informed,” said Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner. Testing at the MSRTC bus depot like Parel and three markets will begin from Tuesday. At Dadar station, those not wearing masks were specifically asked to undergo testing. “We tested 68 people; seven were found positive and asked to go to nearby quarantine centres,” said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, G-North ward. Some of them were hawkers from the Senapati Bapat Marg area. Teams were also deployed at LTT for tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbairandom-antigen-testing-off-to-tepid-start-mall-goers-prefer-to-turn-away/articleshow/81639609.cms||Richa Pinto

Cops suspect the women might be involved with Banjara gangs having two different tricks for theft. Posing as needy people, who have been affected financially by the pandemic and have nothing to eat, they visited various houses. While the women and children kept the victims busy in a conversation, a teenager would pick up electronic appliances from their houses. The second modus operandi was to find locked houses for robbery when the residents were away. “The latest complaint was lodged by Pranab Kumar Chatterjee, a resident of Girish Park. He had gone upstairs to have breakfast this weekend. When he returned, he found some ornaments, Rs 50,000 cash and two mobiles missing. He checked the local CCTV and found a woman with a toddler entering the house. Later, she called a youth inside,” said a police officer. The Banjara gangs that had been operating in the southern suburbs might be targeting various areas in north and central Kolkata now, cops suspect.

---||Nagpur||Need more powers to govt to regulate schools’ fees: Lawyer to state||NAGPUR: After the Maharashtra government invited suggestions on amending the ‘Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011’, a city-based lawyer demanded suo motu powers to its officials to inspect private schools’ records and accounts to check if the fees charged are justified or not. The government was compelled to invite suggestions after receiving several complaints from aggrieved parents against private schools coercing them to pay the entire fees, even when classroom teaching was not conducted. Nitin Lalwani, practicing at the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court, in his letter insisted on more powers to the government under Section 12 of the Act to issue directives to schools relating to modifying the fee structure if there are some compelling reasons, like the Coving -19 pandemic. “The practice of charging exorbitant fees by educational institutions was on the rise. There was a need to take steps to prevent commercialization of education through profiteering by educational institutions. To curb this practice, the 2011 enactment was brought with the objective to regulate fees in Maharashtra,” the letter said. Highlighting the amendment made in the act in 2019, Lalwani said that though it was brought to empower parents to approach authorities constituted under the act, it was damaging to them as it tilts the balance in the management’s favour. “With this amendment, the concept of aggrieved parents’ group was introduced, which means not less than 25% from the affected standard or school, who oppose any decision taken by the management. Due to this quota, the management is in a secure position to declare fees as per its whims and fancies, as it was absolved from the obligation to approach the Executive Parent Teacher Association (EPTA) with a proposal to approve the fees.” Praying for repealing the 2019 amendment in Section 6 of the Act, the lawyer said it was diluted to suit the management’s convenience. “The management can be well within the four corners of the law and still exploit parents by profiteering.

The three accused attacked Amar Singh with an axe and stones while he was alone at his home on Sunday afternoon over a land dispute following which he was rushed to Jhalawar district hospital, where he succumbed to injuries. The accused were identified as Dheeraj Singh (62), his wife Ummed Kanwar (55) and their son Tanwar Singh (35). Dheeraj Singh and his family had illegally occupied the agriculture land owned by the deceased as he had no child, Sarolakalan SHO Raghuveer Singh Hada said. The three entered Amar Singh’s house, where was lying on a cot on Sunday afternoon, and allegedly attacked him with an axe and stones and fled from the spot leaving the old man in a pool of blood, he added. The other members of the old man’s family were away in the field at the time of incident, he said. Following information of the incident, his family members reached home and rushed Amar Singh to a local hospital where doctors referred him to Jhalawar district hospital, the SHO said, adding the man succumbed to injuries during treatment later in the evening.

They have been running from wall to wall with pots of paints and brushes reflecting the fact that even in the age of social media, good old graffiti still find favour among political parties to grab the attention of voters. “Much of the work on LDF candidates is over because the front released its list of candidates much ahead of others. But we are running against the clock for completing the orders from UDF and BJP candidates,” says K R Sha, a graffiti artist based in Kochi. Sha has put in place several teams in various locations and himself works with an assistant for almost 12-14 hours a day. The graffiti artists take the orders directly from the candidates and the walls are whitewashed and kept ready by the candidates themselves. Sha says as the parties delayed candidate lists, they decided to paint symbols and slogans first, leaving names and faces for later. Some of the candidates who were sure that they would be on the list were quick to book the walls and whitewash them. “Now, I have sought the help of several youngsters who know how to paint to finish the work,” Sha says. When flex boards were introduced many artists left wall-writing and joined other professions. We are trying to bring many of them back, at least for temporary work, to meet the deadlines. “We have too much work at hand,” he says. Experienced graffiti artists work on 25-30 walls (6-metre each) a day. The cost for painting works varies from Rs 500 upwards depending on the extra works on the wall. Printed portraits are affixed on the wall and then they work around its borders, adding colours, so that they look natural. With authorities imposing a ban on flex and plastics, parties have been forced to promote eco-friendly alternatives such as cloth and paper during campaigning. “As for banners, eco-friendly cotton fabric costing around Rs 20 per square feet is normally used,” says Shamir P Ibrahim, who’s into branding and LED displays. As the state moves into a new normal, post-Covid-19, business is picking up for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/graffiti-artists-hands-full-with-poll-prep/articleshow/81638961.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

The complaint was registered on the PMOPG portal by vice-president of Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh Hemant Goyal.“We had demanded a financial assistance of Rs 1,000 for persons with disabilities (PwDs) under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana during the Covid crisis in the country. We also raised the issue on the PMOPG portal after the ministry of rural development failed to execute it. Meanwhile, the proposal was sent back to the state’s social justice department by the PMOPG portal stating that action should be taken in the matter,” said Goyal.“The state’s social justice department informed me about it. I told the department that the financial assistance was sought from the central government and state government has no role to play in the matter.

---||Mumbai||Vax turnout drops by 14% across Mumbai, 2.5 lakh more doses coming||MUMBAI: The city’s vaccination turnout on Monday dropped by a significant 14% from the previous day (Saturday). BMC chief IS Chahal’s hopes of one lakh vaccinations in a day fell a long way short, with merely 42,420 getting immunised across 100 centres in Mumbai. The city is expecting a mega consignment of 2.5lakh doses on Tuesday to boost the drive. Nearly two months since the drive started, the state has managed to give both doses to a mere 4% of the target population; Mumbai has given it to nearly 6%. The state has an estimated 1.77 crore in the priority groups, including 22lakh from the city. While the state is inoculating average of 2.5lakh daily, Mumbai is clocking between 42,000-45,000 doses daily. Though coverage for both shots is not far below national average, experts say there is room for improvement. The drive here started with a lukewarm response from healthcare workers on January 16 but picked up significantly by March 1 when it was opened for senior citizens and those above 45 years with comorbidities. However, a steady decline in footfalls has been noted since the past week in these categories as well. On Monday, 22,185 senior citizens in Mumbai stepped out to take the jab compared to the initial high of 28,000-30,000. But daily footfall of the over-45 with co-morbidities has risen to touch nearly 5,000 vaccinations on Monday. Dr Jalil Parkar, who consults with Lilavati Hospital, said even if infections seen in the second wave are mild, immunisations are necessary. “It definitely helps reduce severity,” he said. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said turnout is not a problem in public centres where vaccination is free and swift. He said the private sector which is handling “only 20% of the load” is seeing fewer recipients. “We have asked them to tie up with nearby housing societies and NGOs to get more people,” he said.  Thane mayor Naresh Mhaske has drawn the attention of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Prime Minister Modi to shortage of vaccines. He said the drive is picking up momentum, but there is an acute shortage of stock.

---||Jaipur||‘Agri laws won’t help farmers & aam aadmi’||Jaipur: Shaheed Bhagat Singh’s nephew professor Jagmohan Singh, who held a press conference in Jaipur on Monday, said the three farm laws passed by the Centre were neither in the interest of the farmers, nor that of the general public. He said the laws were passed with the intention to benefit “international corporates and private companies”. “Farmers are understanding this very well,” he said. A Kisan Mahapanchayat will be organised at Jaipur’s Vidyadhar Nagar Stadium on March 23, observed as Martyrs’ Day to mark the death anniversary of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, in support of the farmers’ protest against the Centre’s three farm laws. The Kisan mahapanchayat will be attended by Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait. Singh also said the Central government is unwilling to pass a law to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for agricultural produce because it “will disturb the existing system” and “reduce profiteering” which will be enjoyed by the private companies. “Legal guarantee for MSP will ensure that they (farmers) at least get their cost of production in return, but they only want to destroy agriculture,” he said. “The laws were passed in a hurry to benefit the corporates. The union agriculture minister (Narendra Singh Tomar) had admitted in the Parliament that the government had taken agriculture loans from the World Bank amounting to Rs 3,000 crore in the past three years (from 2018-19 to February 2021). But, the minister did not disclose the purpose for taking the loans,” said Singh.“This is very strange because the government cannot make agriculture policies without consulting the farmers and people living in rural areas which is a violation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas. But nobody knows for which scheme the money was utilised,” he added. He also said that a parliamentary committee had asked the government to implement the “Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act in letter and spirit” because this would help government “mint money”. “The intention is to benefit only 5 per cent people, instead of 80 per cent people of the country. After Essential Commodities Act was amended, there was an export amounting to Rs 27,500 crore of essential food items. Parboiled rice is now being exported at a very fast pace,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/agri-laws-wont-help-farmers-aam-aadmi/articleshow/81639623.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They discussed the issue pertaining to increasing their grade pay to Rs 3,600. While the government sought two month’s time to resolve the issue, the patwaris refused to accept their demand.“We told the government that a meeting should be held along with the officials of department of personnel (DOP), revenue, finance, chief secretary and the minister to discuss on the three-point demand of the patwaris. After that an assurance should be given to us in writing. A meeting is likely to happen on Wednesday,” said Rajendra Nimmiwal, president of Rajasthan Patwar Sangh. “If they give us in writing that our demands will be fulfilled, the Patwar Sangh will take a decision (on ending the protest). If the demands of the patwaris are not accepted by the government by March 25, the patwaris from across the country will come in support of Rajasthan Patwar Sangh’s movement,” he added.Nimmiwal said that on Tuesday a day-long fast will be observed at the tehsil headquarters on the occasion of Martyr’s Day. Meanwhile, a delegation of unemployed youths, led by Upen Yadav, met chief secretary Niranjan Arya on Monday and demanded release of advertisement for technical helper's recruitment exam, relaxation in age-limit, conducting offline exam and having centres in Rajasthan.

---||Goa||Goa: Babush urges his detractors in BJP to work together||PANAJI: Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate, whose panel swept the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) polls on Monday, thanked BJP karyakartas for helping him win, and also urged his detractors, including former MLA Sidharth Kuncalienker, to work with him. Monserrate made it amply clear that he had no intention of allowing any other person to contest the Panaji assembly seat. Monserrate went to the extent of asking his critics within the BJP to “stand and clap” for him, as not everyone can be given a chance to contest elections. “This panel is a BJP panel and credit goes to the party. The party played a major role,” said Monserrate. “Our main aim is Panaji first. Everything needs to be sorted out.” When asked who he would nominate as mayor, Monserrate said that the decision would be taken by the party. He was non-committal when asked if his son Rohit, who won from ward number 3, would be named mayor. Monserrate said that although 50% of BJP karyakartas worked against him, he would try and ensure that for the 2022 assembly election, he has the full support of the karyakartas. Monserrate’s move to sideline senior BJP karyakartas and councillors rankled some of the old guard, who overtly and covertly come out in support of the We Ponjekar panel. Kuncalieker has been missing from the scene in BJP’s campaign for the civic polls, while former spokesperson Dattaprasad Naik openly came out against Monserrate. The Panaji MLA had defeated Kuncalienker in the 2019 Panaji by-elections as a Congress candidate, but quickly switched over the BJP along with nine other Congress MLAs. Monserrate’s entry into BJP has been a sore point for many staunch BJP workers, particularly die-hard supporters of former chief minister Manohar Parrikar or those very close to Kuncalienker. “All are not winners. Somebody has to stand and clap as. BJP cannot nominate three candidates for the assembly elections. There is just one, so I push forward and appeal to everyone to work together,” said Monserrate. The MLA was so dismissive of the BJP rebels, that he refused to even give them credit for losing in five wards. “I don’t give any credit as far as rebels are concerned. It is my fault that I did not campaign hard enough in the five seats that we lost,” Monserrate said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/babush-urges-his-detractors-in-bjp-to-work-together/articleshow/81639720.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana will raise Rs 16,000 crore by land sale: T Harish Rao||HYDERABAD: Finance minister T Harish Rao on Monday announced that the state is planning to raise Rs 16,000 crore from sale of land parcels. Replying to a discussion on the budget in the assembly, he said there were unused land parcels and they plan to sell them. The state government had planned to get income from sale of land last year, but the plan did not materialise due to Covid-19. He was responding to questions raised by Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhatti Vikramarka’s question that how the state government was planning to get income as budget outlay was very huge. “We have planned and made those budget provisions, we are aware of capital receipts,” he said. Disclosing another plan to generate income for the state, the finance minister said a new mining policy was in the offing to increase non-tax revenue. Dismissing the opposition’s claims that the state government has huge debt and would be unviable to manage, he said the debt was within the GSDP and loan ratio decided by the central government and Reserve Bank of India ( RBI). “ Loans cannot be more than the ratio decided by the central government, we are well within the limits, Congress-ruled Punjab is in the third position when public debt and GSDP ratio of the state is taken into account, it stands at 31% there,” he said. Rao further said Telangana was fourth from the bottom in the GSDP– debt burden ratio. Refusing to accept Bhatti Vikramarka’s observation that state has more than Rs 3 lakh crore public debt, he said guarantees given by the state cannot be considered as loans. “The debt is about Rs 2. 8 lakh crore now. In addition, we give guarantees to corporation, for example if we give Rs 20,000 crore guarantee to civil supplies corporation to buy produce, then it will be paid back to that corporation by Food Corporation of India ( FCI). How it can be called loan?” he questioned. He informed the House that in the next financial year the state government would have to pay about Rs 26,000 crore for debt servicing. The minister said that the state was performing well on many parameters, including that of the per capita income, per capita consumption of power, growth in agriculture and allied sectors. He further said the TRS government has delivered all promises made, but opposition leaders without looking into positive side were only criticizing the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-will-raise-rs-16k-cr-by-land-sale-harish/articleshow/81638999.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Day after remarks, KT Rama Rao tries to mollify Eatala Rajender||HYDERABAD: A day after health minister Eatala Rajender’s comments in Karimnagar created a flutter in what many perceive them to be over his strained relationship with the party leadership, TRS working president KT Rama Rao held a one-to-one meeting with the senior leader at Pragathi Bhavan on Monday afternoon. Soon after the House was adjourned, KTR took Rajender in his car to the CM’s camp office from the assembly. KTR reportedly spoke with Rajender on the comments which the latter made at a meeting on Sunday and tried to mollify him. Rajender is believed to have told KTR that the remarks were ‘general’ in nature and that they should not be seen holding a magnifying glass. At the inauguration of a Rythu Vedika in Veenavanka in Karimnagar district, Rajender said he was upset, hurt and disappointed sometimes, but has never left the right path. He also said he had faced several hurdles but only temporarily. “Not money, caste or party are important, only good deeds and humanism are important,” the minister said. These sensational remarks evoked a lot of speculation in political circles if all is well within the TRS vis-a-vis Rajender’s relationship with the party leadership.But, this was not the first time that Rajender has made such comments at public meetings. There were even rumours that he would be dropped from the cabinet during the reshuffle. Earlier, in one of the meetings, he had said: “We are the owners of the party flag and my minister’s post is not anybody’s pittance.” At another meeting, Rajender claimed he would always support the farmers’ agitation irrestive of him holding a minister’s post or not. He made these remarks when there was speculation that KTR would be made the CM a couple of months ago. In another meeting, he said paddy procurement centres should continue for the benefit of the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/day-after-remarks-ktr-tries-to-mollify-eatala/articleshow/81639003.cms||Koride Mahesh

The whole village was in grief on Monday as the mortal remains of the kids were buried by the family members.On Sunday, five children playing hide and seek by concealing themselves in a drum turned fatal when the lid gor locked accidentally.

The RMC had fixed the upset price of Rs 1.25 lakh per sq m. However, the plot was sold at just Rs 200 per sq m higher than the upset price. The plot was bought by Om 9 Square LLP, one of the three bidders, for Rs 118.16 crore. The plot is located opposite the city’s tallest 22-floor building on the 150-feet Ring Road. Gopal Chudasama, partner at Om9 Square LLP told TOI, “We are planning to construct a commercial building on this plot. According to our calculation, the plot fits the criteria for a 100m high or (70 floors) building as per new regulation. We want to construct the tallest building of the city here subject to regulatory approvals.” The real estate group is into building commercial properties and already has two properties on Sadhu Vasvani road. The entire 11-km stretch of 150-feet Ring Road having BRTS connectivity is being developed as a commercial hub. Several big malls and one multiplex, between KKV Chowk to Nana Mauva Chowk, are coming up on the Ring Road. Paresh Gajera, president of Rajkot Builders Association (RBA) said, “The base price of the auctioned plot was 15 to 20% higher than market price. Looking at the current situation where demand for commercial property is down, the RMC plot’s deal can be said to be one of the biggest in recent times.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rmcs-9-4k-sq-m-plot-fetches-rs-118-cr-in-e-auction/articleshow/81637982.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covishield gap rise: State, Centre on same page||Kolkata: After a Union health ministry advisory on Monday recommended the extension of the gap between the first and second doses of Covishield vaccine to four to eight weeks from the existing four to six weeks, the Bengal government instructed hospitals here to follow the norm and defer the second dose deadline. At a meeting at Swasthya Bhavan on Monday, the state health department told hospitals to promote vaccination proactively to include as many recipients as possible and to go by the Centre’s recommendation. Stating that they would follow the instructions, hospitals pointed out that the extension of the gap between the two doses would hopefully make the vaccine even more effective against Covid and the spaced-out dates would streamline the process further. The Union health and family welfare ministry advisory stated that “in view of the emerging scientific evidence, the interval between two doses of Covishield has been revisited by National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization and it has been recommended to provide second dose of Covishield at 4-8 weeks’ interval instead of the earlier practised interval of 4-6 weeks”. It went on to add that “keeping the existing scientific evidence in view, it appears that protection is enhanced if the second dose of Covidshield is administered between 6-8 weeks but not later than the stipulated period of 8 weeks”. “We will start promoting vaccination soon. We have stepped up the numbers sharply over the last two weeks and continue to do it. As the government has promised to provide more vials, increasing the number of recipients should not be a problem,” said AMRI Hospital CEO Rupak Barua. “We will start implementing the advisory on the second dose immediately. Our recipients will be counselled and told the second dose will be most effective between six and eight weeks,” said R N Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) zonal head R Venkatesh. Experts felt the instruction should be followed as it was backed by scientific evidence and research. “There are studies in the UK that have been pointing out that Covishield was most effective if the second dose is taken between six and eight weeks. The idea is to make the vaccine effective and so, this should be followed,” said Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. A majority of recipients had anyway been delaying their second shot to five-six weeks, some doctors said. “The informed recipients have been reading about greater efficacy between six and eight weeks and have been delaying the second shot beyond four weeks. It also helps hospitals handle the crowd. But it could be a problem if everyone wants the second dose between four and six weeks,” said a private hospital doctor. While stepping up vaccination would help, it would not provide foolproof protection from Covid yet since not enough had been inoculated, said CMRI director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. “Only about 30 lakh have been vaccinated in Bengal, which has a population of 10 crore. It is a miniscule number and we must stick to all precautions, especially as numbers are raising,” said Dhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covishield-gap-rise-state-centre-on-same-page/articleshow/81639718.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The victim submitted the complaint to Udaipur SP Rajiv Pachar and has demanded to suspend the entire staff of the police station. “We have received the woman’s complaint. Her family was called for investigation in an abduction case that has been solved. Since the woman has given the complaint, an investigation has been instituted in the case and the probe has been assigned to circle officer (east) Rajiv Joshi,” Pachar told TOI. The complainant, a resident of Mal ki Toos in Vallabhnagar block, said she received a call to come to Hiran Magri police station on Friday evening. The cop who called her said that there was an abduction report against her and her family and if they don't show up immediately, a police vehicle would lift them from their home. The woman and her family reached Udaipur around midnight and were made to wait overnight at the station. The woman claimed that when the CI came in the morning, they were taken to different rooms where the cops allegedly thrashed all of them badly. She alleged that male cops tortured her and even tried to take off her saree. Meanwhile, revealing details of the abduction case, the SP said a woman, Bharti, wife of Lokesh Khatik, had lodged her infant's abduction complaint against her relatives Shankarlal, Kailash, Vinod, Prahlad, Kishan and Jasoda following which the cops had asked them to come to the police station. However, during investigation, it was learnt that Bharti’s one-month-old baby had died a fortnight ago in the hospital after some ailment and that the infant was buried in a crematorium. The infant's body was exhumed and sent for medical examination where the truth was exposed. The police said Bharti and Lokesh had married against the wishes of their family and recently, when another girl from the clan eloped, the family members suspected that Bharti had encouraged them. To take revenge, Bharti had made up a false abduction story and tried to trap her relatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/udaipur-woman-accuses-cops-of-misbehaviour-and-torture/articleshow/81639661.cms||---
---||India||UK police and Oxford university open investigation into bullying of Indian student||LONDON: The police and Oxford University have commenced investigations after receiving complaints about the bullying of Indian student Rashmi Samant, whose case was raised in the Indian Parliament. BJP member Ashwini Vaishnav said last week in the Rajya Sabha that the treatment meted out to the 22-year-old, forced to quit as the first Indian female president-elect of the Oxford University Student Union (OUSU), reflected colonial-era attitudes. Samant had only been at Oxford — where she is pursuing MSc in energy systems — five months when she was elected as president, then subjected to online bullying after old Instagram posts of hers were unearthed which led to accusations she was racist. She caught the next flight to Udupi, in Karnataka, where she ended up hospitalised for three days with stress. Whilst she was in India, Dr Abhijit Sarkar, an Indian-origin postdoctoral researcher at Oxford University, put up an Instagram post and a photo of her parents indicating they are Hindus, saying: “She has come to Oxford from Karnataka, which is a bastion of Islamaphobic far right forces… Far right desi forces … want to reinstate sanatan Hindutva culture … Oxford students are still not ready for ‘Sanatani’ president.” Pt. Satish K. Sharma, director of the Global Hindu Federation, has filed a police complaint on Samant’s behalf accusing Sarkar of inciting religious hatred and bullying and harassment. Thames Valley police confirmed it was investigating an alleged hate incident. Samant has initiated her own complaint with Oxford University about Sarkar. An Oxford University spokesperson said it was fully committed to creating an environment where Hindu students and staff can feel welcome. “We have strong policies in place to protect our students and staff against all forms of harassment. An investigation is ongoing,” the university said. The Oxford India Society, Oxford South Asia Society and the Oxford University Hindu society issued a statement saying that Samant’s “insensitive remarks about other minority groups” are what prompted calls for her resignation. “These calls did not have anything to do with the fact that she is Indian, Hindu or a woman.” But other students have sprung to her defence, with one saying the episode “smacks of liberals virtue signalling”. Samant is continuing her one-year masters online from India despite having paid £24,000 in fees. “I don't feel safe going back to Oxford. I don’t see any concrete actions by the university and the fact a faculty member has made a statement has emboldened other students who continue to make defamatory statements about me,” she said. She is the first child in her family to go to university.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uk-police-and-oxford-university-open-investigation-into-bullying-of-indian-student/articleshow/81643804.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Yellandu MLA Haripriya Banoth said tribal women were missing out on KCR Kits as they were not able to confirm pregnancy in government stipulated 12 weeks and it was only after the fourth or fifth month that they were approaching the authorities. Even Vikarabad MLA Anand Methuku, who is a doctor, brought to the notice of the House that in many cases women were not able to confirm their pregnancy in 84 days due to irregular periods. Anand urged the government to relax rules and extend the criteria from 84 days to at least 100 days, while Haripriya requested it to extend it to 5 or 6 months or consider removing the number of weeks specification itself. Many legislators also demanded an increase in the number of vehicles to transport pregnant women to hospitals as part of the Amma Vodi scheme. The government has sanctioned vehicles, but they were not sufficient and that there should be at least two vehicles for every mandal, the members said. Medical and health minister Eatala Rajender said the government would positively consider the requests of the members. Stating that over 11.91 lakh women have benefited under the scheme since 2016-17, he said the state government has spent Rs 246 crore for the scheme in 2017-18 , Rs 273 crore in 2018-19, Rs 392 crore in 2019-20 and Rs 263 crore up to February in the current fiscal. “The budget for the KCR Kits has only been increasing,’‘ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mlas-want-pregnancy-intimation-clause-dropped-for-kcr-kits/articleshow/81639009.cms||Roushan Ali

It has though guided the mercury to dip across the state, the Met reports said. High-velocity winds were reported from many places in Jaipur, Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Dausa, Bharatpur and Alwar districts. People in Jaipur woke up to the hottest morning of the season so far with a minimum temperature of 23.0°C. However, in the afternoon, high-velocity winds blowing at about 45 km/hour brought in dust storm and scattered rainfall in some parts of the state. Due to the high-velocity winds, many colonies in the city witnessed abrupt power cuts. Due to the power cuts at some of the localities, there were also problems in water supply. Also, outskirts of Jaipur including Shahpura, Dudu, Kothputli and Bassi witnessed mild to moderate showers in the evening. Some areas on the outskirts also witnessed hailstorm in the evening. Dust storm, mild showers and hailstorm were also witnessed at Dausa, Jhunjhunu, Sikar and Karauli districts. Churu remained the hottest in the state where a maximum temperature of 38.0°C was recorded. Despite hailstorm, rainfall and dust storm, majority of the places in the state witnessed their maximum temperature on or above 35.0°C. Attributing the continued rise in mercury to the active western disturbances and upper air cyclonic circulation, Jaipur Met office stated that there would be some respite from the scorching heat conditions in the state in the next couple of days. The ongoing spell of dust storms and erratic rainfall has given sleepless nights to the farmers in the state in almost every part where they have witnessed crop damage. Heavy dust storm and hailstorm has damaged crops in Kota, Jhalawar, Baran and Bundi districts. In its forecast Jaipur Met office stated that mild showers and dust storms would be witnessed at many places in the next 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dust-storm-hail-rain-in-many-parts-of-raj-bring-mercury-down/articleshow/81639729.cms||---

The matter came to light after the victim’s mother, a resident of Madhapur, approached the Telangana high court, urging it to intervene in the matter.  In her prayer before Justice K Lakshman, who heard the plea, she asked the court to free her daughter from the ordeal. While the victim, married and settled in Australia with a five-year-old son, has been writing to Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and other social media platforms to remove the fake accounts created on her name along with the nude content in them, it’s failed to yield any result so far. She has also approached the police. Following her mother’s plea, the judge sought to know from the station house officer of Cyberabad cyber crime police station the steps taken so far to nab the culprits. The official has been given time till March 30, to respond. The judge permitted the petitioner to approach the Union ministry of communications with a representation asking them to take action as per law. The judge also issued notices to Google, Twitter and Facebook asking them to file affidavits explaining the safeguards in place to protect people’s privacy in such cases. The victim’s mother, in her petition, explained that her daughter was in a relationship with her classmate for a short time in 2011. The relationship ended within eight months as the boyfriend was becoming increasingly abusive. He pressurised the girl and obtained her nude photos threatening to commit suicide if she did not send him such photos. Later, when the girl ended the relationship, her photos started appearing on social media platforms. After a complaint, the photos were removed in 2012, but they resurfaced again in 2019. When the victim, now 30-years-old, confronted her ex-boyfriend, he said that he had not uploaded the photos. When the husband came across the photos, he asked his wife get the photos removed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/woman-struggles-to-get-nudes-removed/articleshow/81639015.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar, while hearing a petition filed by one Kunal Kaushal, passed the order. Kunal had urged the court for filling up the posts of permanent teaching faculties in the law college under the Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU). The petitioner had also pleaded that even the principal of the law college had no eligibility for the post. The high court later increased its ambit and sought details about all law colleges across the state. The petitioner was represented by counsels Dinu Kumar and Ritika Rani. Vishwajeet Kumar Mishra appeared for the Bar Council of India (BCI), Ashhar Mustafa for the university and Shashi Shekhar Tiwari for the state government. The BCI has submitted an inspection report of 28 law colleges across the state, including the Chanakya National Law University (CNLU), before the high court on Monday. The CNLU was found to be fulfilling more than all the requirements. However, overall 72.2% posts in rest of the colleges were found lying vacant. The BCI inspection report highlighted that altogether 584 law faculties were required and 450 of the positions were lying vacant. It also highlighted that there were three law colleges in state which were running without having any faculties, eight didn’t have qualified principals and 19 law colleges were not covered by UGC payscale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hc-stays-fresh-admissions-in-all-law-colleges-in-bihar/articleshow/81638297.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Sitting councillor from Monserrate panel pulled down by political novice||PANAJI: Lost amidst the victory of the BJP-backed panel in the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP), is the surprising story of a political novice punching above his weight to defeat a sitting councillor backed by the mighty power of the Panaji MLA. At 24, Joel Andrade was the youngest candidate for the CCP polls and will now be the youngest councillor. Many did not expect Andrade, a communications professional and former journalist, to fare very well, especially since he was up against sitting councillor Rahul Lotlikar. With the wards being redrawn and cut up to favour the ruling side, nobody expected Andrade, who has never stood for elections, to do well. To most people’s surprise, Andrade managed to pull 50% or 496 of the 977 votes from ward 8, upsetting the plans of Lotlikar, who got 433 votes. “It is a good step to start with and now we need to sit together and work something for the city,” said Andrade. “About 40 of my voters did not come out because many of them had Covid. Even their neighbours, who were my sure voters, were not willing to come out.” Congress, which did not contest the elections, may draw solace from the development since Andrade was appointed as the convenor of the Panaji Congress block just 16 days before the elections were held. “The party leadership backed me and campaigned with me, but the other candidates were left to fend for themselves and many of them did not know what to do. Whether councillor or not, I will build the party block in Panaji,” said Andrade. Ward 8 was redrawn during the delimitation exercise with parts of ward 7, 9 and 10 merged together. The move was expected to work in favour of the BJP-backed panel, but appears to have backfired. Though Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate claimed that he did not work hard enough in the ward, sources said that he worked extensively in the ward and was even seen doing the round on the day of the polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sitting-councillor-from-monserrate-panel-pulled-down-by-political-novice/articleshow/81639731.cms||---

---||Goa||Deleted to elected: Justice for Nelson||PANAJI: From being deleted from the electoral roll to winning the elections to the Corporation of the City of Panaji from ward 1, Nelson Cabral’s journey during the course of the civic polls has been one of poetic justice. Cabral, a former Corporation of the City of Panaji corporator, lost the elections in 2011 and 2016, but this time around trounced BJP-backed candidate Malcolm Afonso by 59 votes to emerge victorious. The ruling side attempted to thwart Cabral’s bid to contest the Corporation of the City of Panaji polls by “erroneously excluding” his name along with 60 others from the voter rolls for wards 1 and 2 of the Corporation of the City of Panaji in the Dona Paula area. Cabral’s home was excluded from CCP limits and was brought under the Taleigao village panchayat’s jurisdiction even though he was paying taxes to the CCP. Cabral had consequently approached the high court of Bombay at Goa seeking that his house be brought under CCP limits, which the court upheld. He is a known political critic of Panaji MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate and also holds tremendous influence in the Dona Paula area. Outgoing councillor Nazareth Cabral, his brother, also found his name omitted from the electoral rolls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/deleted-to-elected-justice-for-nelson/articleshow/81639747.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Choosing liquor brands will be easy, revenue to get a fillip||NEW DELHI: Restaurateur Avantika Sinha rues not being able to shop for her favourite brand of liquor in Delhi as freely and confidently as she does abroad. Buying liquor, which is as simple as going to a grocery store around the world, is a task still difficult to imagine for women in the city. She says most women still rely on male friends to buy alcohol for them locally or at duty-free stores. Delhi government’s new excise policy which plans to promote private participation in modernising liquor vends is just what many women shoppers like Sinha had wished for. She says buying liquor should be as simple as visiting a duty-free shop where one gets the best of global options without any sweat. “This is a great move. This will make stores accessible and better brands available,” said Sinha. Shriram Monga of SRED, a retail consultancy, says with liberal excise policies, a few good stores had started opening across the city over the past few years. Rather than being at secluded spots, Monga says, these are nicely designed stores at prominent malls and metro stations that give confidence to people to shop. Private participation will allow for more liquor stores at good locations across the city, which will have a modern ambience and ease of shopping, feels Monga. As much as restaurateurs are relieved at the lowering of drinking age from 25 to 21, many are eagerly looking forward to increased private participation in the liquor business. Restaurateur Navneet Kalra, who runs multiple outlets in the city, says that rather than be dependent on the excise department, he hopes to be able to procure liquor directly from these modernised shops. Just as people go to good restaurants that have multiple options, Kalra says restaurateurs too now will source only from retailers that offer a good price and options of liquor from across the world besides better availability and stocks. This move, he says, will do away with consumers or restaurants being dependent on anyone for their alcohol and not be forced to buy only what’s available. Namita Chhabra, who runs a liquor store in Mayapuri, welcomes the decision but adds that most vendors like her would like the government to ensure that there is no bidding for existing private licence holders like her. Being among the very few women in the city to own and operate an L7 licensed liquor store in the city, Chhabra says private participation should not come at the cost of big players wiping out individual operators like her. She says there should be enough safeguards for her, existing private licences should be renewed for the full year, a better retail experience ensured and checks put in place to prevent big conglomerates from monopolising the market and making only their brands available. The primary reason for the government decision to exit the liquor business is leakage of revenue. On an average, a government outlet gives Rs 5 crore in excise duty annually while a private outlet gives Rs 8 crore. Buying liquor from a government-owned shop can often turn into an exercise in jostling and grabbing whatever is available. The choices are limited and there is no opportunity to browse. The private shops which are going to replace the government ones will be far bigger and also provide a walk-in experience. Delhi government’s liquor shops are run by Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation, Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation, Delhi State Civil Supplies Corporation and Delhi Consumer’s Cooperative Wholesale Store Ltd which will return to focusing on their primary work when the government exits the retail liquor trade. “The advantage of having minimal governmental presence in the retail sector is that it helps keep a check on the tendency of private players to engage in malpractices like overcharging and cartelising,” said an official.

Forest minister A Indrakaran Reddy informed the assembly on Monday that in all, 217 crore saplings have been planted, including rejuvenation as against a target of planting 230 crore saplings, set by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. Replying to questions from TRS members M Yadagiri Reddy, A Rekha Naik and Balka Suman during question hour, the minister said surveys by the Government of India agencies have revealed that the forest cover has gone up by 3.67% in the state. Hyderabad has been recognised as the Tree City of India. It’s not only just planting but the government has been laying focus on ensuring 85% survival rate of the saplings planted so far. To achieve this, the Panchayat Raj Act and Municipal Act have been amended making elected representatives and officials responsible for survival of the saplings. Also, 10 per cent green budget is allocated by the local bodies from its total outlay. He said that as against the total geographical area of 2.77 crore in the state, Telangana has 66.66 lakh acres of forest area. The forest cover constitutes 24% of the total geographical area of Telangana as against the national average of 21.3%, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/haritha-haram-ups-states-forest-cover-by-more-than-3-6/articleshow/81639026.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Kolkata||Gumnaami, Jyeshthoputro bag national honours; Bong connection laurels in other categories, too||Kolkata: Srijit Mukherji’s film, ‘Gumnaami’, based on the book, ‘Conundrum’, on Netaji’s disappearance mystery, bagged two national awards in the feature film category of the 67th National Film Awards this year, when the nation is celebrating Subhas Chandra Bose’s 125th birth anniversary. Srijit pointed out that ‘Gumnaami’, which had been adjudged the Best Bengali Film, raised “thorny questions” and “pushed for awareness of an issue that had been a lot talked about in a unidimensional way for a long time”. “This award was supposed to be announced last year but got delayed due to Covid-19. ‘Gumnaami’ has transcended the cinema screen and turned the issue of our national hero into public discussion to become a part of the social, political and historical consciousness. It made us question whether we have honoured the man’s legacy beyond having a Netaji Research Bureau that comes up with facts and books, which we know,” he said. While ‘Gumnaami’ and Kaushik Ganguly’s ‘Jyeshthoputro’ —both starring Prosenjit Chatterjee—won two screenplay awards in the feature film category, Prabuddha Banerjee’s background score for ‘Jyeshthoputro’ received national recognition. According to Prabuddha, background score is as “important and painstaking” as a film’s editing, sound design and art design in the post-production stage. “All reputed music directors in the world are known for their background score. Most of them barely got the opportunity to composing songs in a movie. This shows the importance of background score. I have been fighting for the importance of background music in our cinema. The award will encourage me to keep the fight on,” he said. Awards in the non-feature film category also have a strong Bengal connect. Sudhanshu Saria won the Best Direction award for his 38-minute English/Bengali short film, ‘Knock Knock Knock’, starring Shantilal Mukherjee. While Shantanu Sen’s ‘Water Burial’ won the Best Film on Environment Conservation/Preservation, Farah Khatoon’s ‘Holy Rights’ on triple talaq shared the award for Best Film on Social Issues. “This award inspires me to choose bold subjects in future,” Farah said. Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute’s production, ‘Oru Paathiraa Swapnam Pole’, won the Best Film on Family Values. Bauddhayan Mukherji won his first National Award for ‘The Shower’, adjudged the Best Promotional Film in the non-feature film category. “The award turned sweeter when my septuagenarian mother hugged me. That meant more than a thousand words,” Bauddhayan said. Arjun Gourisaria has won the award for Best Editing in non-feature category for ‘Shut Up Sona’. Saptarshi Sarkar was honoured as the Best On-Location Sound Recordist for ‘Rahas’. While Kaushik has been adjudged the Best Screenplay writer (original), Srijit has been recognized for the Best Screenplay writer (adapted). The screenplay of ‘Jyeshthoputro’ was initially caught in a controversy over credit issues. But the issues were sorted and Ganguly made the film as his tribute to director Rituparno Ghosh. “I am not thinking about the controversy. I am glad I could do justice to Rituparno’s idea. I am dedicating my award to Ritu-da,” Kaushik said. Srijit believed the awards in the screenplay category would give due respect to writers in the industry. “Screenplay is the spine of the film. For an adapted screenplay, the responsibility increases for the amount of information that is there in the original text,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/gumnaami-jyeshthoputro-bag-national-honours-bong-connection-laurels-in-other-categories-too/articleshow/81639806.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Churches join hands to plan Easter rally on April 4||Kolkata: A massive rally in which Christians across denominations will walk to praise the resurrection of Jesus has been planned on April 4. Four church denomination heads have come together under an umbrella body — United Christians of Kolkata — to organize this rally. This was planned last year as well, but could not be held because of the Covid situation that led to cancellation of all Easter celebrations. The Church of North India, Roman Catholic Church, Baptist Church and Assembly of God Church have joined hands for the rally and a letter has gone out to all churches and Christian organizations requesting pastors and the faithful to participate. The letter has been signed by the heads of the four church denominations — Bishop Paritosh Canning, head of CNI; Archbishop Thomas D Souza, head of the Catholic Church; Reverend Ivan Satyavrata, head of the Assembly of God Church; Sudip Biswas, head of the Bengal Baptist Union. Starting from Bishop’s College at 4.30pm, the rally will converge at the St James School ground where a thanksgiving service has been organized. Apart from the usual Easter prayers, where the resurrection of Christ and its significance in today’s world will be spoken about by the heads of the different church denominations, a special prayer for Kolkata will also be held. “Easter is about new beginnings, about hope for a better world. This is what the resurrection of Jesus teaches us. Hence, we have organized this rally that will see all Christians praying together in these troubled times. We hope the resurrected Lord listens to our prayers,” said Bishop Canning. Earlier, it had been planned that rallies will come from different directions and converge at the meeting ground. But this plan was changed. The churches have jointly approached the city police for permission and necessary assistance. “In these difficult times, when each of us is ravaged by the onslaught of coronavirus, special prayers are needed and I am happy to be a part of the Easter rally. For Christians, this is a special time of prayers and a united front like this helps to build that unique bond,” said Dominic Gomes, vicar general of the Archdiocese of Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/churches-join-hands-to-plan-easter-rally-on-april-4/articleshow/81639062.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Goa||Setback for Sawant in his Sakhali constituency||PANAJI/BICHOLIM: Chief minister Pramod Sawant has failed to retain the Sakhali Municipal Council (SMC). Dasharat Ajgaonkar, the candidate backed by Sawant, lost to Rajendra Amreshkar, the Congress backed-candidate, by 17 votes. With this victory the Congress panel, which has regained majority, has started making moves to take over the municipality. It has moved a no-confidence motion against the Sawant-backed chairperson of the municipality, Yeshwant Madkar. Political observers said that losing a byelection on his home turf is a setback for the chief minister. Amreshkar was backed by the Congress panel ‘Together For Sakhali’ headed by former SMC chairperson Dharmesh Saglani, who had contested against Sawant during the last assembly elections. Amreshkar, who stood from ward 9, polled 259 votes against Ajgaonkar’s 242. Asked why they lost the bypoll in Sakhali, BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said, “BJP has never won that ward.” Urban voters had not rallied behind Sawant even during the 2018 municipal elections, and it was only after some members from the Saglani-backed panel defected that Sawant gained control of the council around eight months ago, a political observer said. “The byelection was crucial for Sawant as it was going to decide the fate of the Sawant-supported council,” another political observer said.In the 13-member council, the BJP-backed panel had 7 members, one of whom had died in November 2020, necessitating a bypoll. With Ajgaonkar losing the bypoll, the BJP panel has lost the majority. Speaking to TOI after the victory, Saglani said that they were so confident of winning that they moved a no-confidence motion against the Sawant-supported chairperson on March 18 itself. “We are waiting for the government to take up the no-confidence motion against the chairperson,” Saglani said.  In 2018, the Saglani camp had formed the first council with nine of its councillors and the support of one independent.Later, two councillors from the Saglani group moved to the Sawant camp, but the council continued to be retained by the former. In another few days, three more councillors moved to the Sawant camp, while one from Sawant’s panel switched over. However, the Sawant-backed panel formed the council. Since November, following Damodar Ghadi’s death, both sides have had six councillors each. While the ruling BJP, includes chairperson Yeshwant Madkar and councillors Brahma Desai, Shubhada Sawaikar, Anand Kanekar, Dayanand Boryekar and Rashmi, the opposition includes deputy chairperson Ansira Khan, Jyoti Blaggaon, Raya Parsekar, Rajesh Sawal and Kunda Madkar, besides Saglani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/setback-for-sawant-in-his-sakhali-constituency/articleshow/81639764.cms||---

On March 14, the school dug the road to lay speed breakers. Next day, after GHMC authorities instructed to stop the work, the same was adhered to by the school management, they said. On March 16, GHMC officials and traffic police visited the school and held a meeting in which they informed that they will lay metal stripes, place signages and a speed checking machine with a constable. “Immediately, the school stopped the work and agreed to the above.

---||Hyderabad||Centre spends only Rs 210 crore on Aasara pensions: Telangana||HYDERABAD: Setting the record straight against the brouhaha created by BJP leaders over central aid to the welfare schemes in Telangana, the state government on Monday informed the state assembly that only Rs 210 crore is being extended by the Centre for Aasara pensions. “The state government is spending Rs 11,724 crore on Aasara pensions of which Rs 210 crore is central government share. Also, this Rs 210 crore central assistance covers only 6 lakh beneficiaries whereas the Telangana government is spending over Rs 11,500 crore to give pensions to over 33 lakh more beneficiaries including the aged, widows, single women, HIV patients, specially challenged, beedi and handloom workers. In all, 39.36 lakh beneficiaries are getting Aasara pensions,” said Panchayat Raj minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao. Replying to questions from TRS members Padma Devender Reddy, A Ramesh and B Mallaiah Yadav during question hour in the assembly on Monday, the minister said the central assistance comes with riders that only Rs 200 should be given to those aged between 60 and 79 years, Rs 500 for above 80 years candidates and Rs 300 for widows and specially challenged. “But the Telangana government is extending Rs 2,016 and Rs 3,016 per month to numerous categories of beneficiaries depending upon their eligibility,” Errabelli Dayakar Rao said. The minister went on to say that none of the BJP and Congress-ruled states are giving so much pension amount to so many beneficiaries. “The social security pension in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state Gujarat is Rs 750, in Karnataka it is Rs 600, Uttar Pradesh gives Rs 500, Bihar gives Rs 400, Madhya Pradesh gives Rs 600, Rajasthan gives Rs 750 and Punjab gives Rs 750. Those criticising the TRS government should realise that aged parents are getting respect from daughters-in-law after chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao increased the pension amounts to Rs 2,016 and Rs 3,016,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-spends-only-rs-210cr-on-aasara-t/articleshow/81639039.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Delhi||Delhi: 22-year-old kills his friend for demanding sexual favours in Trilokpuri||New Delhi: A 22-year-old man was arrested for allegedly killing his friend by bludgeoning him to death in east Delhi’s Trilokpuri during the early hours on Monday. The man told police that he killed his friend as he was fed up of him pestering him for sexual favours. The incident came to light around 4.30am when the staff of an emergency response vehicle spotted a man with blood-stained clothes at Vasundhara Road. When the cops questioned the man, he identified himself as 22-year-old Monu, a resident of the same area.  He told them that he was headed to a police station to report that he had himself killed his friend. The man also led the cops to the body of his friend Bharat, 32, lying on the roadside near Block 17. “Monu was then arrested and booked for murder at Mayur Vihar police station. Bharat’s body was shifted to a hospital for postmortem and his family members were also informed. During questioning, he further revealed that he smashed the head of his friend Bharat because he repeatedly asked him for sexual favours. We are looking into what kind of sexual favours Bharat forced Monu into. The two had met each other through Facebook,” said Deepak Yadav, DCP, East. In another incident reported on Sunday night, a 30-year-old man was shot dead at Alipur Road in outer Delhi. He was taken to a hospital by police where the doctors declared him dead. The man, identified as Shamim Khan, was found involved in cases of snatching and theft. “A case of murder has been registered at Narela police station to probe the killing. A preliminary investigation has revealed that the deceased was previously involved in several cases of snatching and theft between 2014 and 2016. Prima facie, it looks like a case of some enmity. The CCTV footage from the area are being checked and local inquiry is being made to identify and arrest the killers,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/22-yr-old-kills-his-friend-for-demanding-sexual-favours/articleshow/81639802.cms||---

An FIR has been registered against six persons, and two of them, including a woman, have been arrested. According to police, the incident took place around 3 pm on Sunday when Amarpal was returning home in Delhi. He was taken to hospital for treatment, but could not survive. The FIR was registered under sections 147, 148, 149 and 302 of IPC against Amarpal’s elder brother Mahaveer Singh, his wife and four sons on a complaint filed by the deceased’s wife. Talking to TOI, Pisawa station house officer, Jitendra Bhadauria, said there was a long pending dispute over 28 bighas of farmland in the village. While Amarpal lived in Delhi, his two elder brothers — Mahavir and Nepal Singh — lived in the village. Police said, earlier, Amarpal reportedly transferred 3.5 bighas of land in his wife’s name when his mother was living with him in Delhi and the dispute started since then. When their elder brothers came to know about it, they brought their mother to the village and got a “will” prepared in which they willed the remaining land in their names and excluded Amarpal. After their mother’s death, the will was executed and Amarpal raised objections over it. Being a disputed land, it was seized by the SDM court. On Sunday, the officials went to measure the land and do some formalities. After the process, everyone went home. A few hours later, when Amarpal was heading to Delhi, he was attacked by his kin, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/delhi-police-constable-beaten-to-death-by-kin-over-property-dispute-in-aligarh/articleshow/81638038.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Chennai||Chennai: 13 workers died cleaning sewers in 2020-21||CHENNAI: It is more than eight years since the Prohibition of Employment of Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, was passed, but government and private agencies in the city continue the practice. In 2020-21, 13 men, aged between 27 and 45, died in manholes, sewage treatment plants and septic tanks in the city, says the Safai Karamchari Andolan. But, Metrowater and Greater Chennai Corporation say there are no cases of manual scavenging. “There could be a few incidents in rural areas where there is no awareness. We only use machines,” officials told TOI. In just two hours on Monday, TOI spoke to at least six ‘sewer workers’ (new term for manual scavengers) and to families of those who died in sewers and septic tanks in the city. All the workers are men and are from a SC or ST community. They used to get Rs 80 a day. Now, they get Rs 250-Rs 300. One worker, Janakiraman, asked why he was doing the job when he knew it was illegal, said “Don’t they [his employers] know it?” Pointing out that he had no other means of livelihood, he said he had been doing it for 20 years. Divya, whose husband Santhosh Kumar died in a septic tank at the Army quarters in Fort St George last month, said the family knew the risk. “But he was neither educated nor trained for another job.”  The Madras high court recently came down heavily on local bodies for deaths related to manual scavenging, saying commissioners and department heads should be booked if another life is lost. Safai Karamchari Andolan’s D Samuel said that in 2020-21, 40 manual scavengers died across TN including in the Chennai region. “What about incidents that didn’t involve deaths? As per our survey, there are more than 3,000 in the state with more than 700 in Chennai alone. But unless the government conducts a transparent survey and takes ownership, such deaths will continue,” he said. The Safai Karmachari Andolan says S Kannan, 42, and Prakash, 27, died at a sewage treatment plant in Nolambur on January 20, 2020, but Metrowater insists it does not engage manual scavengers. National Commission for Safai Karmacharis member Jagadish Hiremani says that as per the act, engagement of manual scavengers either directly or indirectly is banned, but that the agencies concerned don’t file a case nor suspend any contractor. “They turn a blind eye as they need these people to clear blocks where machinery cannot enter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/13-workers-died-cleaning-city-sewers-in-20-21/articleshow/81639082.cms||Komal Gautham
---||Chennai||Chennai: Rails on sides of MTC buses to reduce fatality||CHENNAI: The Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC), Chennai, has installed auto-retractable rails on sides of some government buses to prevent accident victims from getting stuck under wheels. According to official data, MTC reports five to six fatal accidents every month and over two-thirds of the victims get run over by the rear wheel of the bus. Most of these victims are school and college students, who travel on bus footboards. Despite several warnings, the practice continues unabated on Chennai MTC buses. So MTC has decided to reduce life-loss by fitting rails on both sides of buses. These rails, which cost Rs 5,000 each, automatically levitates and lowers when the buses pass over speed breakers or bumps on roads, said a senior MTC official. But when a passenger slips from the footboard, it prevents them from getting stuck under the rear wheel. Instead, the person will be pushed outside, reducing the risk of death. The passenger will survive, but may suffer injuries, the official added. Similarly, two-wheeler drivers, if they come skid towards the bus, will be pushed aside by the rails. As a trial run, the rails have been installed in three MTC buses which run along routes 597 (T Nagar-Thiruvallur), 91V (Tambaram-Thiruvanmiyur) and 579A (Tambaram-Walajabad) where accident rate is higher. Welcoming this, K Anbalagan, a transportation activist said, "Not only precious lives will be saved, but this is a good financial move too.” On average, MTC pays Rs 20 crore as compensation to accident victims, which will be reduced due to this move. Preventing such deaths will bring a huge sigh of relief for MTC drivers. Their salary hike and promotions are put on hold for three to five years in case they are involved in accidents. Motor Accident Claims Tribunal usually deals only with compensation amount to be paid for victims and seldom discuss the impact accidents have on drivers' pay rolls, he said. MTC officials said that the cost-effective approach will be expanded to other routes after studying the feedback for the pilot project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rails-on-sides-of-mtc-buses-to-reduce-fatality/articleshow/81639068.cms||Ram Sundaram

They smashed earthen pots and banged utensils to draw the attention of the authorities over problems they face every day due to shortage of potable water. Police had to intervene to control the protestors as the agitation continued for some 90 minutes. Later, the civil body authorities tried to pacify the protestors by assuring them time-bound action over their demands. Social worker Saurabh Chaudhary said, “The Gangajal supply pipelines were laid in the Dayalbagh locality three years ago but so far, not a drop of water has been supplied. However, regular bills are being received by householders. More than 40,000 residents of 34 colonies are suffering from water scarcity but the authorities remain unconcerned.” Chaudhary added, “Submersible pumps installed in the area have stopped functioning following a drop in the groundwater level. We will come on the roads very soon if authorities fail to ensure adequate water supply,” he said. Additional municipal commissioner KB Singh said, “We have taken cognizance of the water supply-related problem in Dayalbagh area. The general manager of Agra Jal Sansthan has been asked to act. Very soon, Ganga water supply will be ensured in the area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-women-smash-earthen-pots-bang-utensils-in-protest-against-water-scarcity/articleshow/81638044.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Agra||As Allahabad HC mulls moving Hathras case out of spl court, victim’s family lives in fear||AGRA: A lawyer barged into the courtroom where prosecution evidence for the Hathras gang-rape and murder was being recorded, threatened the prosecution counsel and was followed by a mob that surrounded the victim’s family, the victim’s elder brother has told the Allahabad high court.  With the high court now considering if it should move the trial out of the district special court in Hathras, the family said it would not be able to keep fighting the case if that were not done. “If Kushwaha withdraws because of these threats, no one will be able to help us. Justice will be denied,” the victim’s younger brother told TOI on Monday. “We don’t have the money to hire another lawyer. For everyone’s safety, the case must be moved out of Hathras,” he added. “We are shaken,” the 19-year-old Dalit victim’s sister-in-law said. In an affidavit to the HC on March 18, the elder brother had narrated the events of March 5. “An advocate named Tarun Hari Sharma stormed into the court room and charged towards the applicant and the complainant counsel, shouting and issuing threats. Amongst the barrage of threats extended to the complainant advocate Seema Kushwaha, he stated that in this case the complainant counsel could not represent the victim’s family,” the high court order on March 19 said, referring to the affidavit. “It has been stated that when he aggressively approached them, it was evident that he was under the influence of alcohol. At the same time, a large mob, including lawyers, entered the courtroom and surrounded the applicant and the complainant’s counsel in order to threaten and intimidate them. In these circumstances, the ... Presiding Judge was forced to stop the trial proceedings.” Kushwaha said she was shocked. “I could not imagine a lawyer would enter the courtroom drunk and threaten me in front of a judge,” Kushwaha told TOI. The lawyer in question, Sharma, had that day submitted an application in court claiming that Kushwaha could not fight the case as prosecution. “When I confronted him with an argument to read the provisions in the SC/ST Act, the defence lawyer Munna Singh withdrew the application,” Kushwaha said. In cases under the SC/ST Act, the victim’s family can appoint a counsel of their choice. After the ruckus, Kushwaha further said, Sharma’s father Hari, also a lawyer, entered the court. “He asked me to stay within my limits,” she added. The Hathras district judge was asked to submit a report on the alleged incident to the high court in a sealed cover within 15 days after going over CCTV footage, if any, in the court premises. The IG (CRPF) was also asked to corroborate what happened and submit a sealed cover report to the high court within 15 days. “After the receipt of the aforesaid report, we will consider as to whether trial in question before the Special Judge (SC/ST Act), Hathras is required to be stayed as is to be transferred elsewhere,” the order said. The next hearing is scheduled on April 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/as-allahabad-hc-mulls-moving-hathras-case-out-of-spl-court-victims-family-lives-in-fear/articleshow/81638067.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Hyderabad||Students bring clean water to Rasoolpura||HYDERABAD: For residents of Rasoolpura, home to a thick population of slum dwellers, access to clean drinking water has always been a challenge. And it only worsened during the recent floods. Moved by their situation, especially after witnessing it from close quarters, class 12 student of a city private school, Jayant Manghnani, decided to dive in to help them. Together with a bunch of his friends he turned to social media to raise funds for the locals and ensure they had a fresh glass of water to drink. “I first noticed their plight when I was distributing food packets in the area, during the lockdown. The water they were drinking was highly contaminated. And it only got worse when the floods hit the city a few months ago. That’s when I discussed this problem with my friends and decided to do something about it,” said Jayant. Soon afterwards, the 16-year-old along with his four friends, Antara Agarwal, Nandini Agarwal, Dev Ravi and Eshaan Agarwal, started a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the residents of Rasoolpura. Within 10 days of that, the team managed to raise Rs 1.5 lakh towards the cause. “The money helped us purchase 100 water filters — each one about Rs 1,500 — including the handling charges of the crowdfunding platform,” the student of Chirec International, said. The gesture has, predictably, left residents of Rasoolpura very touched. “The drinking water that is supplied to our area gets mixed with sewage water because of faulty pipelines. Since we started using the water filters, given to locals by some schools students, we have been finally able to drink clean water,” said Shaik Nayeem, a resident of Rasoolpura.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-bring-clean-water-to-rasoolpura/articleshow/81639088.cms||---

The result of foundation was also released with 24.89% students clearing the exam this year and will be sitting for IPCC in next stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ca-results-9-from-city-make-it-to-top-50/articleshow/81639098.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Prima facie, it seems Stan tried to overpower govt, says court||MUMBAI: Tribal rights activist Stan Swamy, 83, is accused of belonging to a “terrorist organisation” and conspiring to overpower the government, politically and by using muscle power, a special NIA court said in its detailed order rejecting bail for the Jesuit priest. The collective interest of the community would outweigh the right of personal liberty and Swamy’s old age or alleged sickness would not go in his favour, it added. Swamy, lodged in Taloja jail since his arrest on October 8, was suffering from Parkinson’s disease, the defence had said, seeking bail. The plea was rejected on Monday and the 34-page detailed order copy was made available on Tuesday. Special judge Dinesh E Kothalikar held that from documents produced by the NIA, prima facie it could be gathered that Swamy and other members of the banned CPI (Maoist) had hatched a conspiracy to fuel unrest in the country and overpower the government. Swamy was carrying out activities to further the objectives of the organisation which was nothing but to overthrow “the democracy of the nation”, the court held. “Therefore, I do not find merit in the submissions for the applicant (Swamy) that only because of membership of a banned organisation, the applicant cannot be detained in jail,” the court said. The fact that Swamy was not present in Pune at the time of the Elgar Parishad, blamed for caste violence at Koregaon Bhima, and was not named in the FIR would not take his defence further, considering allegations that he was an active member of a “terrorist organisation”. The special NIA court took into account records of exchange of around 140 emails between the applicant and co-accused, and the fact that Swamy, co-accused Sudha Bhardwaj and other members of the Persecuted Political Prisoners Solidarity Committee had condemned the conviction of professor G N Saibaba and others under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for Maoist links. The court also cited a witness’ statement to the NIA that Swamy had delivered a speech on the “arrest of human rights activists in Bhima Koregaon case” at a meeting held by the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR) in Kolkata in June 2019. The witness said he realised APDR works for the release of persons arrested for Maoist links.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nia-court-rejects-stan-swamys-bail-application/articleshow/81639813.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Dr Mishra told TOI that there are no new variants or mutations which more virulent than existing strains. “People not wearing masks is the main reason for the spread of the virus again. Out of all the cases we are are getting, only 5% to 6% are of UK strain. We are on watch to check whether any new strain is emerging. Our lab is doing genome sequencing continuously,” he said. He said, “As long as there are a large number of active cases in the country, there is a likelihood of virus mutating and new variants coming up.” He said the biggest challenge is to bring down the infection rate. “For this, wearing a mask is the best solution,” he asserted. The CCMB chief said people should adhere to the ‘social vaccine’ prescribed by them like wearing masks, avoiding crowds and maintaining hygiene. Dr Mishra said with more than three lakh actives cases, there is a risk of the new variant. “Around 7,000 mutants have been identified so far. New variants can always emerge. If we let the virus for a longer time in a large number of people, it is risky,” he added. Researchers said Covid-19 vaccine would not be effective on 15% of the population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-spike-due-to-people-not-wearing-mask-ccmb-chief/articleshow/81639103.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The in-charge of Gosunda Chowki of Chanderiya police station, ASI Shyam Lal Sukhwal, was tied to a tree for hours by villagers for allegedly molesting a woman and forcing her into oral sex. The ASI allegedly assaulted the woman, the wife of the accused in a buffalo theft case, while investigating the dispute. He had gone to the home of the accused to record statements and, finding the accused’s wife alone in a room, he molested her, the woman alleged. Senior police officials rushed to the spot and convinced the villagers to finally release the policeman. Sukhwal had gone to the accused’s house on Sunday to investigate a family dispute related to a buffalo theft for which the complainant suspected his younger brother. The accused's wife told the police that the ASI demanded Rs 5,000 from her not to implicate her husband and said that he would come on Monday to record their statements. He asked the woman to call him when her father-in-law was at home so that he could speak to him as well. On Monday, when the cop reached her home, he was made to sit in a room. The woman alleged that the ASI took advantage of the situation and asked her to sit beside him in the cot. He misbehaved with her and forced her into oral sex. Meanwhile, men from the family and other villagers arrived and caught the ASI who was then tied to a tree. Chanderiya SHO Anil Joshi, Gangrar DSP and other officials rushed to the spot after the villagers informed them about the incident. “I have spoken to senior officials and the ASI about the incident. The ASI said that he had gone to the accused’s home for investigation and was told to wait in a room as the woman's father-in-law was taking a bath. Some men barged into the room and forcibly dragged him to the courtyard where he was tied up. He said that he thinks it was a conspiracy planned by the accused’s side as the woman herself had called him to come home,” ASP Himmat Singh Deval said. Speaking about the incident, Chittorgarh SP Deepak Bhargava said, “The ASI has claimed that he has not even touched her. He has filed a case against some people for obstructing a public servant from discharging his duties. The woman has also given a complaint of rape against the ASI. Both the cases have been registered and the investigation has been assigned to a lady DySP, SC&ST cell. Till we complete the enquiry, the ASI will be posted in the police lines." (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/villagers-tie-copto-tree-for-sexualassault-in-chittor/articleshow/81639801.cms||---

With only four professor-rank members remaining in the university, the quality of education has suffered.Vice-chancellor Rajiv Jain said, “We have called the first meeting and the process will begin. Those who became eligible from 2010, will be given promotions. We are hoping to complete the process as soon as possible. Although it will take some time as interviews of associate professors will be conducted and then the names have to be passed by the Syndicate.”More than 120 associate professors are waiting to be promoted. Many of them have retired without getting to the rank of professor and once the promotions are finalised, they will benefit from this. The VC will be the chairman of the committee, one government nominee, governor nominee and other members will be part of the committee.Without proper number of professors, the university is not given good all India rank. There is hope that it will increase the ranking as with more professors, more PhD students will get opportunity in the university. One professor can take 12 students, associate professor can take eight and assistant professor can take six PhD students. With more research students, university ranking and aid from different sources will also increase.A university source on condition of anonymity said, “They have finally called the meeting and we all are hoping to get promotions. More professors mean good opportunity for others. But this is a lengthy process as if Syndicate does not pass the names for promotions, it will be difficult, and many faculty members have to wait for another five years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ru-to-have-career-advancement-meet-on-march-24/articleshow/81639105.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||How A Year-Long Pursuit For Drugs Cartel Kingpin Ended||New Delhi: Kishan Singh, the kingpin of an international cartel selling drugs to Indian youths, was arrested by Delhi Police upon his extradition on Monday. TOI was the first to report the first case of extradition of a narcotics syndicate kingpin from the UK. Delhi Police confirmed that a team comprising DCP (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwaha and ACP Sanjay Dutt had gone to London to bring Singh back. They landed in Delhi around 11.30pm on Sunday via an Air India flight. Singh (39) will now face trial at Patiala House Courts. He will be produced before the trial court after the mandatory quarantine period and his police custody will be obtained to unearth his drugs syndicate. Special Cell sleuths recalled how they tracked down Singh to Moray Avenue in Hayes, London in 2018 after a year-long pursuit. On February 15, 2017, Yadav’s team had arrested three drug mules — Amandeep, Harpreet and Harnish — with 15kg of “Meow Meow” drug (mephedrone) worth Rs 50 crore. During interrogation, they disclosed that they used to work for Singh. “On his directions, they used to procure and smuggle the drugs from a Mumbai-based supplier. These drugs were then transported to London through courier agents,” said the DCP. Born in Nagaur in Rajasthan, Singh migrated to London in 2009 leaving behind his family and started a business of manufacturing windows, etc. However, he soon took to smuggling drugs, specifically Meow Meow. In 2015, he acquired the citizenship of the UK. His cartel coordinated the drug supply from Africa to Mumbai, which was then shipped to Delhi. Singh had a chain of associates in Mumbai, Delhi and Dubai. Once the consignment reached Mumbai, he would ask his mules to fetch them. The drugs were then shipped to the UAE, UK, USA, Malaysia, etc. After Singh’s location in Mumbai came to a dead end, he was declared an absconder and an open-dated non-bailable warrant was issued against him by a court. “The extradition proceedings were initiated in June 2018 and a proposal was sent to the UK through the Interpol. It was accepted by the Westminster Court, London. In July 2019, his extradition from the UK to India was first ordered and he appealed against it before the London High Court,” said Yadav. After seeing the evidence produced by Special Cell, London High Court refused Singh’s appeal and issued a sealed order for his extradition. Singh then appealed before European Court of Human Rights, but even that appeal was dismissed. After he exhausted all legal options, his extradition was cleared last week. Singh would be most likely lodged at Tihar Jail in the cell meant for economic offenders. He would be provided with all amenities as promised in the extradition document, provided it is in accordance with court order and the jail manual. Police will seek his remand to arrest other members of his cartel, the identity and whereabouts of whom are only known to him. This is the second significant handover by the UK within a year. Last February, Sanjeev Chawla, a bookie and key accused in one of cricket’s biggest match-fixing scandals was extradited from London. The latest extradition has happened within a month of a London court ruling that fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi could be extradited to India in connection with the PNB scam. Another extradition on the cards is of liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who is accused of loan default of Rs 9,000 crore involving his defunct Kingfisher Airlines. Even he seems to have exhausted his legal options.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-a-year-long-pursuit-for-drugs-cartel-kingpin-ended/articleshow/81639822.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Chandigarh||Cops focus on testing Covid violators than challaning||Ludhiana: The city police are now focusing more on testing people for Covid-19 than issuing challans to them. Catching Covid violators has become more like a camp to get people tested on-the-spot. On Monday, the city police, with the help of doctors, tested violators at 20 different spots. According to officials, their focus is to make people wear masks and, as a goodwill gesture, they do not challan those who apparently are unable to pay the fine. From Saturday onwards, the city police have started conducting tests of those who are found without masks. A team of doctors accompany the police personnel who conduct the test and maintain a record of it. Joint commissioner of police (city), Deepak Pareek said, “On Monday, the police arranged 20 set-ups for Covid tests of violators, under different police stations. The crowded areas like the vegetable market near Jalandhar bypass were targeted. When asked about the challans issued to violators, Pareek said, “Our focus is to make people wear masks. We are issuing challans to the violators, however, not to all. In cases like when a rickshaw puller is seen without a mask who probably earns Rs 200 per day, we don’t issue challan as the fine is Rs 1,000. We stop them, given them a mask to wear and then get their Covid tests done. Some people may call it discrimination. However, for us it is our humane side. Our only motive is to make people wear masks and help the administration in stopping the spread of Covid-19. This is the reason the number of challans is lesser than the number of Covid tests being done and the numbers of masks being distributed.” On Saturday, the city police have conducted tests at three locations which have been increased to 20 locations on Monday, added JCP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cops-focus-on-testing-covid-violators-than-challaning/articleshow/81639805.cms||Payal Dhawan

After receiving the consent, the civic body has completed the PT survey. The lottery of the affected house owners will be drawn soon to allot land on the identified site. An JDA official said, “In the recent assembly session, urban development and housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal made an announcement to complete the project this year. Following this, work has been expedited. The lottery will be drawn soon and houses will be razed from the corridor.” Earlier, removing these 604 affected owners, which was posing a major hurdle to the construction of the Jhotwara elevated road project, remained a challenge for the (JDA). However, after receiving the consent last week, the authority was hopeful to complete the structure in 2021.The Rs 108-crore project is aimed at easing traffic in one of the most congested areas of the city and provide relief to over 6 lakh residents. The project is crucial as the narrow flyover has become a major bottleneck.As no land is available on either side, the JDA is left with no option but to construct an elevated road. “Now, notices to raze the structures will be issued. The JDA has resolved the issue peacefully,” said the official.Earlier, shopkeepers had refused to shift to Niwaru Road area that has been identified by the civic body for relocation. They claimed, there business will be seriously affected as the identified location is not developed. However, after series of discussions, majority of the shopkeepers have given consent to shift.In the 2.2-km corridor, work will be geared up as shopkeepers are ready to shift. In the last two-and-a-half years, there has been only 45% progress of Jhotwara elevated road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/affected-owners-of-jhotwara-elevated-road-project-have-given-consent-to-shift/articleshow/81639112.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra home minister status quo may strain Sena-NCP ties||MUMBAI: With the NCP taking a firm stand that home minister Anil Deshmukh will not resign from the council of ministers following former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegations against him, Shiv Sena finds itself in a spot. The NCP move could strain the party’s equations with the Sena amidst the unprecedented political crisis that has hit the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) regime in the state, said analysts. There is no question of Deshmukh stepping down from the state cabinet as Singh’s charges are baseless, Pawar reiterated at a press conference on Monday. Pawar left it to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to seek Deshmukh’s resignation or otherwise. “It’s the chief minister’s prerogative,” he added. Clearly, with Pawar throwing his weight behind Deshmukh, Thackeray cannot press for the latter’s resignation, said observers. Deshmukh’s continued presence in the cabinet, though, may trigger public criticism against the MVA, of which Thackeray is the executive head. Also, the CM may find it difficult to placate his ministers if he retains Deshmukh as home minister, they added. Many in the Sena want Deshmukh to put in his papers in view of the magnitude of Singh’s charges. A section in the Sena is of the opinion that the NCP, which is in charge of the key home portfolio, can’t escape its responsibility and Thackeray alone can’t be made to face public ire. The Sainiks are quick to point out that Thackeray had sought party minister Sanjay Rathod’s resignation following an uproar over the alleged suicide of a Pune girl last month. “Uddhavji immediately sacked Rathod. Now, the NCP too should give marching orders to Deshmukh in view of the seriousness of Singh’s allegations,” said one. By asking Thackeray to tackle the resignation issue, the NCP could well be shifting the burden on the CM, said Mantralay mandarins. Sources said the NCP was keen to keep away from the Singh imbroglio which, a party strategist explained, deviates from the “core issue”: Security threat scare to industrialist Mukesh Ambani. “The emphasis should be on how a car filled with gelatin sticks was found parked outside Ambani’s residence,” he said. Pawar too repeatedly said the focus should not swerve from the security angle. Political experts said Pawar, who scripted the MVA story to keep the BJP from assuming office in November 2019, could be miffed with the Sena for its knee-jerk reaction to the political turmoil that will test the MVA’s resilience. “During his long stint in public life Pawarsaheb has weathered countless political storms. It is quite likely he thinks that the Sena lacks the tact to resolve knotty political issues,” said an NCP activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaideshmukh-status-quo-may-strain-sena-ncp-ties/articleshow/81639817.cms||Ambarish Mishra
---||Hyderabad||Mallanna, TJS may hold key to TRS’ fortunes in bypoll||Hyderabad: After the marathon MLC elections, major political parties have now shifted their focus on the April 17 Nagarjuna Sagar assembly constituency bypoll. While the nomination process will begin from Tuesday, all eyes are on independent candidate Teenmar Mallanna and Telangana Jana Samithi president M Kodandaram, who together polled 2.50 lakh first and second preference votes in the Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda MLC seat, which also covers Nagarjuna Sagar. Palla Rajeshwar Reddy of the TRS who eventually won the seat, polled over 1.61 lakh votes. Political analysts say TRS could benefit again in Nagarjuna Sagar if Teenmar Mallanna and the TJS party enter the electoral fray.Other candidates, including Cheruku Sudhakar and Rani Rudrama Reddy, who were at the forefront of Telangana agitation, too polled considerable votes, dividing the anti-TRS vote. Too many candidates may spoil the prospects of the opposition in Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll too, analysts have warned.But it was mainly Mallanna and Kodandaram who upset the apple cart of the main opposition parties, particularly the BJP, which was trying to consolidate itself as the only alternative to the ruling TRS, after its victory in Dubbak bypoll and GHMC elections. The BJP and Congress candidates were pushed to fourth and fifth place in the MLC seat with Mallanna and Kodandaram polling over 1.49 lakh and 1.03 lakh first and second preference votes respectively, taking the second and third spots respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mallanna-tjs-may-hold-key-to-trs-fortunes-in-bypoll/articleshow/81639118.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Mumbai||Charges against Maharashtra home minister aimed at derailing probe: Sharad Pawar||MUMBAI: Sharad Pawar on Monday ruled out state home minister Anil Deshmukh’s resignation. “The question of his resignation does not arise,” he said. The NCP chief said he had on Sunday termed the allegations as serious and suggested an inquiry but the new information had changed the situation. Devendra Fadnavis and other BJP leaders soon tweeted Deshmukh was not in quarantine but had addressed a press meet on February 15. Fadnavis later said Pawar had not been briefed properly. “From the series of SMSes mentioned in Singh’s letter, it is clear the meeting took place at end of February,” he tweeted. When claims of BJP leaders about Deshmukh having addressed a press conference on February 15 were mentioned to Pawar, he said details given to him like the hospital certificate showed Deshmukh was in quarantine. Some aides told Pawar at the press meet that the video posted by BJP could be a video conference by Deshmukh. Deshmukh, however, said he had indeed spoken to the media that day. “Fadnavis has raised questions mark over my interaction with the media on February 15. I never denied it. After I tested positive for Covid-19, I was admitted in a Nagpur hospital on February 5. After I was cured, I was discharged, and as I was coming out of hospital, there were a large number of mediapersons who were keen to know my views on the row over tweets of Lata Mangeshkar and Sachin Tendulkar on farmers. Initially, I told them that owing to weakness, it would not be possible for me to comment but when they insisted, I spoke to them for a few minutes and then left for Mumbai.” Deshmukh admitted he had flown to Mumbai but said it was not against medical advice. He said he had consulted his treating doctor and only after his approval had travelled to Mumbai. “My discharge certificate is clear. It says, ‘He is non-infectious to others from Covid-19 point of view and he is fit to fly considering his current stable medical condition’,” Deshmukh said, quoting from the certificate signed by Manoj Pethe, consultant pulmonologist at Alexis Multispeciality Hospital, Nagpur. Pawar reiterated his charge that allegations against Deshmukh appeared an attempt to disturb the probe into the “main case” about the explosives-laden car found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the alleged murder of the car owner. Pawar said that the ATS investigation in the case was going in the right direction as it had arrested two people for the killing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaicharges-against-home-min-aimed-at-derailing-probe-pawar/articleshow/81639809.cms||---

Kaushik, who was formerly state urban development minister does not hold any ministerial position in the present government and therefore his usage of the state helicopter to go to Bageshwar and the guard of honour accorded to him led to a controversy erupting. Opposition Congress leaders termed the episode ‘a blatant misuse of power’. The party also accused the police of working at the behest of the BJP government. Taking cognisance of the matter, SP Bageshwar Amit Srivastava has ordered a probe in the matter. Notably, Kaushik had come to Bageshwar on Monday morning to meet party workers and address a few gatherings. After his helicopter landed in Bageshwar, he was given the guard of honour by a police contingent. Thereafter, he reached the party office in an open sedan. Hundreds of BJP functionaries and locals attended his road show. Meanwhile, when contacted, Kaushik said he wasn’t aware that he would be given the guard of honour, adding that his party has no involvement in the incident. He further said that the police should not have given him the guard of honour although he did not explain why he had accepted the guard of honour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/guard-of-honour-to-ukhand-bjp-prez-stokes-controversy/articleshow/81638079.cms||---

According to the SOPs, the pilgrims will have to register themselves online and dharamshalas as well as hotels and guest houses will have to screen people before giving them rooms to stay. The administration has also urged people over 60 years to avoid coming to the mela. The pilgrims have also been asked to not cook inside the forests to avoid forest fires. The mela, which was called off last year a few days after it began due to the Covid-19 threat, will be held from March 30 to April 30 this year. Meanwhile, on Sunday, a fire broke out in the hill on which the Purnagiri temple is situated. Sources said that there were around 4,000 pilgrims in the premises at the time of the incident.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Bogus voters: EC finds merit in Chennithala’s complaint||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The allegations raised by opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala that there were duplicate and multiple entries in the voters’ list have been vindicated by the election commission (EC). Chief electoral officer (CEO) Teeka Ram Meena said on Monday that the duplication happened as booth-level officers (BLOs), who are supposed to verify applications received for entry of names into voters’ list, hadn’t verified them physically by visiting the applicants’ homes, he said. The CEO said that in the primary investigation conducted by district collectors, the matters raised in the petition were found to be correct as there were several duplicate entries. He said that on the basis of the investigation, 590 double entries were found in Vaikom (1,606 was flagged by UDF), 434 in Idukki (1,168 was raised by UDF), 570 in Chalakudy (570 was in the complaint), 800 in Palakkad (2,400 was flagged by UDF) and 640 in Kasaragod (1,053 raised by UDF). However, Meena added that Kerala is not the only place where such duplicate entries were found in the list. He said 26 lakh duplicate entries were found across India. He said that the state had removed 60,000 double/multiple entries till Jan 20. There were 64 lakh double entries in the list till Jan 1, 2019 and hence ECI was insisting on constant purification of the list. In the case of Uduma in Kasaragod, where Chennithala had said that one voter named Kumari was issued five election identity cards, Meena said that the mistake happened at the hands of the assistant electoral registration officer, who had issued duplicate cards even without the recommendation of BLO. The officer was suspended, pending an inquiry, he said. Meena said that the commission is taking steps to ensure that the voter, who figured more than once in the list, votes only in the polling booth where he/she is supposed to vote. For this purpose, BLOs are verifying where the voter resides and which polling booth he or she is supposed to vote. He said that verification process is on in all 140 constituencies. BLOs undertaking inspection will prepare a booth-wise list that will be shared with the presiding officers. EC has finalized a list of 2,74,46,039 voters in state for elections, by including the 9,22,079 applications received after Jan 20 this year. Regarding several complaints raised by some political parties that they are unable to find booth agents in opposition party strongholds, Meena said EC has relaxed rule and it would now allow a voter of the constituency to become a polling agent for a political party. Meanwhile, Chennithala has sought ECI’s immediate intervention after 3,24,291 duplicate voters were found by Congress workers in 135 constituencies. He added that the number of duplicate voters are enough to influence the results of an election. In his letter to chief election commissioner Sunil Arora, he said that there is a very organized attempt to topple elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bogus-voters-ec-finds-merit-in-chennithalas-complaint/articleshow/81639127.cms||---

---||Meerut||Bihar BJP MLA facilitates wedding of Muslim couple||MEERUT: It all began with a brief, casual hello on Instagram, five months ago. Their friendship blossomed quickly. On Thursday, Meerut’s Ayesha Akhtar, 20, gave the college a miss and instead boarded a bus to Bihar’s Araria. Three days later, and over 1,350km on, the bus chugged into Araria station Sunday afternoon. Saddam Ansari, 22, was already there, holding his breath. They tied the knot the same day, bringing the virtual relationship to an end. But, in between, back home in Meerut, the family members of Ayesha had approached police. Worried and uncertain, the couple had approached local BJP MLA Vijay Kumar Mandal, who not only helped them in tying the knot but also informed Meerut police about it. Investigators at Meerut’s Lal Kurti police station breathed easy after getting a call from MLA Mandal. So did the family members of Ayesha after four days of frantic search. Mandal is MLA from Sikti constituency in Araria district.  A team of Meerut police has now reached Araria district. It has recorded the statement of Ayesha. “We received information from a BJP MLA that the missing girl is in Bihar and that she has married a youth from the area. In her statement, the girl told police that she had left her home to get married. She will be produced in a court on Tuesday where her statement will be recorded in front of a magistrate,” said Suraj Rai, additional superintendent of police, Meerut (Cantonment). According to sources, MLA Mandal had arranged the wedding at his residence in presence of family members of the youth and scores of other locals from the area. “The youth is from my area and the girl has come from Meerut, all alone. I also checked her age and found that she is an adult. She told me that she will end her life if she doesn’t get married. So I spoke to families and the marriage was solemnized in the village,” MLA Mandal told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bihar-bjp-mla-facilitates-wedding-of-muslim-couple/articleshow/81638120.cms||Piyush Rai

---||Dehradun||In just 3 months this year, 5 tigers dead in uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand, which has the third-highest population of tigers in the country, has lost five big cats in a span of two and a half months – two to natural causes and two to infighting whereas one died in an accident. Three of the deaths took place in Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR). Last year, six tiger deaths had been recorded in 12 months. In 2019, 13 tiger deaths were reported, whereas eight deaths were recorded in 2018, 14 in 2017, seven in 2016 and 13 in 2015. Uttarakhand has an estimated total population of 442 tigers in the wild. The first tiger death of this year was on January 7 in Ramnagar forest division due to an accident. On January 15, a second big cat died in Haridwar forest division’s Shyampur range. The death was attributed to “natural causes.” Most of the state’s tigers are in CTR (231), as per the latest estimate of the Wildlife Institute of India. At 14 tigers per 100 sq km, CTR has the highest tiger density among all tiger reserves in the country. Speaking with TOI, director of CTR, Rahul (who goes by his first name only) said that since Corbett has a high density of tiger population, violent territorial fights are common which sometimes result in deaths. According to forest department data accessed exclusively by TOI, the first tiger death in the reserve occurred on February 1 and was categorised as a natural death. On March 15, a tiger was found dead in CTR’s Kalagarh range. Within a week, on March 21, another was found dead in the tiger reserve’s Dhela range. The deaths have been put under the “infighting” category. The tiger reserve has been on high alert since the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) nabbed poachers with ivory from the region. With the Haridwar Maha Kumbh nearing, footfall has increased in the region. Forest fires are another cause of concern for officials, as the blazes drive wild animals out of forests and into traps set by poachers. Moreover, the WCCB has alerted forest authorities about members of UP’s notorious Bawariya gang of poachers moving closer to Uttarakhand. However, authorities do not believe any of the tiger deaths this year were caused by the Bawariya gang. “If a member of the Bawariya gang kills a tiger, they do not leave a trace of it. That was not the case this year,” said an official who did not wish to be named. Meanwhile, one more healthy adult male tiger was found in a wounded state in a fringe village of Terai East, Haldwani. The big cat has been tranquilised and moved to a rescue centre at Ranibagh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-which-lost-6-tigers-last-year-loses-5-in-just-3-months-this-year/articleshow/81638119.cms||Shivani Azad

We will work for saving lives while ensuring that livelihood of people is not affected,” said Sharma. Health department has taken a gamut of decisions for preventing spread of the virus and one among them is the decision of making Covid report (RT-PCR) mandatory for those entering the state from anywhere in the country. “If anyone comes without RT-PCR test, his mobile number will be registered at RajCovid app and he will have to give a pledge of adhering to Covid guidelines and will be kept under isolation for 15 days. Beat constable of the area will ensure that the person is following the guidelines of home quarantine for 15 days,” said Sharma. He said there are provisions of penalties for violating norms. “There are penalties for not wearing masks and also for flouting other norms. We have strict measures for it, but we do not want to create an environment of fear. People should be self-disciplined and follow the guidelines to prevent spread of the virus,” he said. Moreover, he said chief minister Ashok Gehlot had also appealed to people to avoid crowded places. Besides, all the collectors have been directed to develop facilities for institutional quarantine in all the districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/lockdown-not-an-option-livelihood-and-lives-both-important-health-minister/articleshow/81639122.cms||---

The information was revealed in an RTI reply filed by Kumaon-based activist Hemant Gauniya. Speaking to TOI, Gauniya said that he had filed the RTI query before the office of the Lieutenant Governor which was later transferred to the chief executive officer of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board, Katra. “I wanted to know how much donation the temple has received over the years. Even though lakhs of pilgrims visit the temple every year, I did not expect the cash amount as well as gold and silver donations to be this high,” Gauniya said. The Vaishno Devi Temple is one of the most revered Hindu shrines. The temple was taken over from Baridars – men living near villages in Katra who had been worshipping the goddess for years – in 1986 after the Shrine Board was created. Since then, the board has been managing the affairs of the temple. Meanwhile, the RTI reply has also revealed the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the pilgrim footfall at the shrine. According to the data given by the Shrine Board, the number of pilgrims at the temple has been increasing over the years. While around 50 lakh people visited it in 2000, the number rose to around 80 lakh in both 2018 and 2019. However, in 2020 only around 17 lakh people visited the temple – which was a drop of 78%. “The temple had the highest tourist footfall in 2011 and 2012 when over a crore people visited it but the pandemic has badly affected the pilgrimage. Only 17 lakh people visited the shrine last year which affected the local economy that depends almost entirely on tourism,” Gauniya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/vaishno-devi-temple-received-over-rs-2000-crore-cash-1800-kilos-of-gold-and-4700-kilos-of-silver-in-last-20-years-rti/articleshow/81638135.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Meerut||Family feud in UP village leaves 15 dead in 3 decades||MEERUT: An uneasy calm hid the turbulence in Bulandshahr’s Dhanora village on Monday. A day before, the village had lost another inhabitant to bullets, and to the rivalry between two families which started in 1990 and refuses to end. Police on Monday put the number of dead in the last three decades at 15. Locals say there are more. And no one bothered about those serving jail for the killings in both the families. On Sunday morning, six gunmen opened indiscriminate fire at an SUV. They had come for Dharmpal, now 60. He survived. But his son, Sandeep, 28, couldn’t. In 2019, Dharmpal had lost his brother, Jagpal. Last year it was his father, Kalicharan. It started in 1990, during the Holi revelry. A political rivalry between Kalicharan and Rajendra Singh took an ugly turn. Four members of both the families were killed. Their sons inherited the enmity. Kalicharan’s son Dharmpal and Rajesdra’s son Amit later waited for chances to strike at each other, police said. “I was young then. But our elders have told us that the entire village was divided into two factions on the occasion of Holi in 1990. Four people were killed that day. Since then, the rivalry seems to have entered the third generation,” a local said. District police chief claimed that at least 15 people from both sides have been killed over the years. “Several men, young and old, from both sides are serving sentences after being convicted in these murders. Five people including Rajendra Singh are currently serving life sentences in the 1990 murders. People accused from Kalicharan’s side got the benefit of doubt and were let off,” Santosh Kumar, Bulandshahr senior superintendent of police (SSP) said. Police believe that the Sunday’s attack was ordered by Amit, Rajendra Singh’s son who is currently lodged in Bulandshahr jail for Kalicharan’s murder in May 2020. In 1995, one person from Kalicharan’s family was killed. And in 2005, Kalicharan's wife and a domestic help were shot dead. “Rajendra Singh’s wife, also Amit's mother, was killed in 2009. This was followed by Kalicharan’s son murder in 2019 and finally Kalicharan was killed in May 2020,” the SSP said. Sandeep was the latest victim. His brother, Jitendra, now wants justice. “If criminals can fire on police, how is a common person supposed to protect himself. I kept alerting the district administration and police about the looming threat on my family. But all pleas fell on deaf ears,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/family-feud-in-up-village-leaves-15-dead-in-3-decades/articleshow/81638134.cms||Piyush Rai

Between April 2020 and January 2021, the Delhi airport handled 1.5 crore passengers, while in the corresponding period the year before, it saw 5.7 crore passengers. The second biggest loser was Mumbai with 3.2 crore fewer passengers in the pandemic year, followed by Bengaluru with 2 crore fewer passengers, according to data provided by the Airports Authority of India. It was this week, a year ago, that Indian airports shut down to airline passenger flights as part of the nationwide lockdown. International flights were suspended on March 23 and domestic services on March 25. Domestic flights resumed, with restrictions, on May 25 and passenger load has been on a steady rise since then. A comparison of passenger traffic registered at major Indian airports from April to January in 2020-2021 and 2019-2020 showed that the Mumbai airport had the highest percentage fall in passenger traffic of 80.6%, followed by Chennai at 80.4%, Bengaluru at 68%, Delhi at 67.6%, Kolkata at 67% and Hyderabad at 64%. But the passenger volumes list was led by the busiest airport in India, Delhi, with 1.32 crore fewer international passengers and 2.85 crore fewer domestic passengers. The second largest loser, Mumbai had about 1 crore fewer international passengers and 2.2 crore fewer domestic passengers. When it comes to volume of flights, Delhi airport had 2.2 lakh fewer flights, followed by Mumbai (1.7 lakh) and Bengaluru (over 1 lakh). If looked solely at percentages though, the highest fall in passenger traffic was registered by small airports like Bhatinda in Punjab, Puducherry, Mundra in Gujarat and Pithoragarh in in Uttarakhand, where traffic fell by 99% in the select period, as compared to the previous year. Pithoragarh—the smallest airport on this list —registered a traffic of just seven passengers in April 2020-January 2021, as opposed to the 3,800-odd passengers it saw in the corresponding period the year before.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-airport-worst-affected-by-covid-lost-81-flyers-in-10-months/articleshow/81640438.cms||Manju V

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot, too, had recently said if the public don’t follow the guidelines properly, the state government would take stringent measures. Every DCP in Jaipur has been asked to ensure people in their respective districts follow the guidelines and in case of violations, strict action are taken against them. “During January and February, police were a little lenient on those not wearing masks. But now it is high time to go tough against those risking their lives and also of others by roaming around without masks and not maintaining social distancing,” said a senior officer of Jaipur police commissionerate. ACP (law and order) Rahul Prakash said, “As night curfew has been imposed, we have also decided to start penalising people for not maintaining social distancing and wearing masks at public places. Also, at crowded markets, our special teams will be deployed to ensure people should folow Covid guidelines.” Also, the senior police officers in the recent crime meetings have discussed how to go about the violators. “Government has started bringing various measures, and penalising the public is also one of the component. I think everyone has experienced how bad was the phase of lockdown and rising cases, thus there is a need to follow guidelines,” said a senior officer of Jaipur police commissionerate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-police-all-set-to-go-tough-against-covid-protocol-violators/articleshow/81639128.cms||---

After a hiatus of 11 months, the state had resumed physical classes for class 9 and above from February. Subsequently, the government had permitted students of class 6 and above to attend school for physical classes. Barely a month and half later, the schools were again getting back to online teaching as Covid-19 cases were on the rise, especially in several schools, colleges and hostels. “We have about 8,000 students and we do not want to put their lives at risk. Beginning Monday, all students will attend online classes except class 10-12 students, who will complete their practical exams in batches from the campus,” Delhi Public School, Nacharam, principal Sunitha Rao said. While most CBSE schools are contemplating to roll-back to online classes, the state board schools were still continuing with the hybrid model. “Online classes are continuing parallelly. In most state board schools, attendance is still not 100%. Many students still continue to attend classes online,” Telangana Recognised School Managements Association general secretary Sadula Madhusudan said. Some schools have recorded a few positive asymptomatic cases. While practical exams for class 10-12 will continue, physical classes for class 6-9 students will he held online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fearing-rise-in-covid-cases-some-city-schools-log-back-to-online-classes/articleshow/81639174.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Bhopal||In suicide pact, 2 jump to death in front of speeding train||Bhopal: In an alleged suicide pact, a 17-year-old girl and a 19-year-old boy jumped in front of a moving train in Obedullaganj locality and died. The deceased went missing from their respective homes three days ago; their bodies could be identified on Sunday evening when Bhopal police with the help of a taxi driver reached the spot and informed their family members. Railway officials said that the train driver had honked the horn several times to warn the two youngsters, but the deceased did not move away from the tracks. SHO Chhola Anil Singh Mourya said, “The deceased girl came in contact with the boy three years ago and they became friends. Their friendship soon turned into a love affair. The girl’s family members spotted her chatting with the deceased boy and objected to it many times, but she did not stopped talking to him.” Both the youngsters went missing from their homes on Friday, March 19. Their family members filed a missing person’s complaint too; police were searching for them. Cops found that the girl and boy were spotted together in a taxi before they went missing; they quizzed the taxi driver. Cab driver told police that deceased boy booked the taxi on Friday afternoon. Together the youngsters went to Bangrasia where they had lunch at a restaurant and then went to Bhojpur temple. Later they went to Bhim Betka caves and had snacks at Umaria village around 4.30 pm. They paid Rs 1600 fare to the taxi driver and said that they would return by train. SHO said, the youngsters committed suicide by jumping in front of Jan Shatabdi Express on March 19. “It was revealed that the deceased loved each other and wanted to marry but their families were against their marriage so they took the extreme step,” said Mourya. SHO Obedullaganj Ashish Sapre said, nothing which could help police in ascertaining their identity was found at the spot. Police shared the youngsters’ photographs on social media after which the girl’s brother identified her body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/in-suicide-pact-2-jump-to-death-in-front-of-speeding-train/articleshow/81638148.cms||---
---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots: Accused gets bail on fifth try||NEW DELHI: A man accused in a northeast Delhi riots case was granted bail on his fifth try by a city court. He was denied bail four times earlier. The court opined that he had neither been specifically named in the FIR nor did he face any specific allegations. “He has not been identified by any public witness. There is no independent CCTV footage/video clip of the case available on record,” said additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav. The man was arrested in connection with a February 2020 incident wherein a bookstore was looted and set afire. The counsel appearing for Akram argued there was a major change in circumstance as two co-accused persons had been granted bail. The accused’s alleged role was stated to be the same as that of the other two. It was argued that Akram was a daily wage worker and breadwinner of his family and that no public witness had identified him in the case besides the fact that police made no recovery of any material from him. The prosecution argued that a policeman had identified Akram who was arrested on March 20, 2020, but conceded that the role assigned to Akram was the same as that of the other co-accused. The evidence being relied upon was also the same. The court noted that it had discarded the ground of identification by the policeman at the time of bail plea of the two other accused. “This court is conscious of the fact that besides the present matter, the applicant is also an accused in several other cases of riots. But that cannot be a ground to deny him bail, as the present bail application has to be decided in the context of present FIR and the investigation so concluded,” it observed. Holding that Akram was entitled for bail on the ground of parity, the court further noted that the investigation in the case was complete and a chargesheet had been filed. “Trial is likely to take a long time. The applicant cannot be made to be incarcerated in jail for infinity merely on account of the fact that other persons who were part of the riotous mob have to be identified and arrested in the matter,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/riot-accused-gets-bail-on-his-fifth-attempt/articleshow/81639827.cms||---
---||Meerut||Farmers show black flags to UP BJP chief||BIJNOR: A group of farmers protesting against the controversial farm laws showed black flags to BJP state president Swatantra Dev during his visit to Bijnor on Monday. Protesters raised slogans against the ruling party too. Swatantra Dev was on his way to the Bijnor district headquarters from Dhampur town after attending a programme when protesters tried to stop his convoy and showed black flags near Rashidpur village located adjacent to Bijnor city. Police swung into action and dispersed farmers from the route of the convoy. Eight farmers were detained. Later, farmers led by RLD’s district president Rahul Singh staged a dharna here at the Bijnor city police station demanding immediate release of the farmers. The government is trying to crush the voice of the farmers, Singh said. Bijnor superintendent of police Dharamveer Singh said, “We had diverted the route of the convoy of the BJP state chief as we suspected that farmers might create a ruckus. Besides, we have detained eight persons for spoiling peace. Some farmers later staged a dharna here. We are now mulling what to do with them.” Earlier, addressing a gathering at Dhampur, party’s state president Swatantra Dev said, “There shouldn’t be stubbornness in any protest. In fact, growers are being misled in the name of protest. If there is any misconception, farmers should sit with the government and understand things. I am assuring them that the farmers will have no loss due to the new laws. MSP will stay and no mandi will lose its existence after the implementation of new laws.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/farmers-show-black-flags-to-up-bjp-chief/articleshow/81638142.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Bhopal||Bittan market divided over use of masks, social distancing even as Covid cases up||Bhopal: Bittan Market, the preferred vegetable market of Bhopalis that remains open thrice a week and also houses a variety of shops and restaurants, is a mixed bag when it comes to adhereing to Covid-19 norms. The divide is clear: Masks, social distancing and sanitisers availability is no issue at big showrooms. But the picture is in sharp contrast at road-side eateries and small shops, where there is hardly any space for the customers and every inch of space inside the shop remains occupied during peak hours. In such set of shops, compliance to ‘compulsory mask’ rule is far less than the showrooms or restaurants. “I wear mask myself but it’s difficult for me to ensure that every customer, who comes to my shop also wears one. You have all kinds of people coming to a mobile shop, some wear masks, avoid coming close to another customer and there are other, who don’t even wear masks,” said owner of a mobile shop in the market. Parking and spaces are full of youngsters most of the time, sipping tea and having snacks, and only few of them care to wear mask or maintain social distancing. “There are some medical shops here, where you will find everyone in masks. In other shops also, people normally wear masks. They may take it off or may not wear it properly at times but the crowd in the middle of the market, nobody wears masks. They keep chatting, sipping tea, having snack here,” said Vishnu Dutt Tripathi, who has a pet care shop in the market. In smaller shops, most of the people sighted had masks but masks tied to the chin. Most of the vegetable vendors in the market were also seen with masks tied to their chin, some of them would put it on properly only when customers ask them to do so. President of Bittan Market Vegetable Vendors’ Union, Hariom Khatik, when asked what his union was doing to see that vegetable vendors in Bittan Market wear masks and social distancing is maintained among the customers coming to market, said, “We have asked all the vendors to wear masks and we are also trying to see that customers also come to market in masks. We are seeking cooperation of the police in this. During Saturday market, we got 8-9 people, who were not wearing masks, fined Rs 100 by the police,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bittan-market-divided-over-use-of-masks-social-distancing-even-as-covid-cases-up/articleshow/81638156.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Kozhikode||BJP missing in action: Advantage LDF or UDF?||Kozhikode/Thrissur: After high court dismissed the petitions filed by NDA candidates from Thalassery, Guruvayur and Devikulam challenging rejection of their nomination papers on Monday, the question in everyone’s mind is what will happen to the votes that these candidates would have gained. The disgrace of not having party candidates in Thalassery would be the most painful for BJP, given the area’s significance in its turbulent history and the attempts to find a foothold in communist stronghold. The party, which was pinning its hopes of getting a favourable verdict for its candidate N Haridas, doesn’t have much credible options now. Haridas said party will approach  Commission of India and it was up to BJP state leadership to decide on extending support to an independent candidate. BJP is in a bind as a shift in the vote base (22,125 votes going by the party’s performance in 2016 assembly elections) to either UDF or LDF would be politically damaging. It could give rise to questions and explanations about possible, unholy electoral alliance. BJP had seen its vote share increase in the constituency from 5.9% in 2011 to 16.6% in 2016. Given the intense rivalry between BJP and CPM in Thalassery, it is unlikely that the party’s core vote base will favour CPM candidate AN Shamseer, who won here in 2016 by 34,117 votes. In the event of the party not pledging support to an independent, some of its votes may go to Congress candidate MP Aravindakshan. Congress representatives were pressing for the rejection of Haridas’s nomination papers during the scrutiny and Aravindakshan had tried to file an intervention petition in the high court against accepting the BJP candidate’s nomination papers. Though there are three independent candidates in the constituency, two of them are namesakes who are likely to have been fielded by BJP’s rivals. Former CPM rebel COT Nazeer, who is contesting under the banner of Indian Gandhian Party, is the other candidate in fray. Nazeer said though BJP leaders haven’t contacted him with support, he was getting calls from BJP supporters saying that they would vote for him this time. ‘New candidate in Guruvayur’ Meanwhile in Thrissur, BJP leaders claimed that the party will have a candidate in Guruvayur though the high court dismissed the petition of candidate Nivedida Subramanian. She added that she will explore the possibility of approaching ECI after studying the HC order. “BJP will have a candidate in Guruvayur and there will not be the need for a conscience vote there,” said district convener advocate KR Hari. Sources said hectic parleys are on to identify a new candidate and a decision will be taken tomorrow. While CPM has fielded NK Akbar in Guruvayur, IUML’s KNA Khader is the UDF candidate. SDPI’s Asharaf Vadakkoott, SUCI’s M Kumar and Dilip Nair of Democratic Social Justice Party and independent candidate Antony are also in the fray at Guruvayur. There are reports that some informal discussions had taken place between BJP representatives and Nair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/bjp-missing-in-action-advantage-ldf-or-udf/articleshow/81639328.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||BJP MP’s remark: Complaint filed||ROHTAK: Two days after BJP MP Ram Chander Jangra took a jibe at the ongoing farm protests, a Meham-based man on Monday lodged a police complaint against the lawmaker and sought legal action against him. Rajya Sabha member Jangra, in video recorded on Saturday, was heard calling farmers sitting on protest on the Haryana-Delhi border as alcoholic, free-eating, aimless people who had no work to do and were at the protest for free food and liquor. In a complaint lodged at Meham police station, Kashmir Saharan, a farmer who cultivates two on acres at Farmana Khas village here, stated that farmers had been protesting peacefully on the borders of Delhi for more than 100 days. Commenting on Jangra’s remark, which he described as “derogatory”, Kashmir said, “It does not suit a leader who is in an official position like his to make such a remark, especially when over 200 farmers have lost their lives during the struggle.” He said the statement seemed to be delivered on a public platform with the intent to provoke farmers. Saharan said he supported the protest and his feelings had been hurt by Jangra’s statement. He said he had lodged a written complaint to seek legal action against BJP MP. Meham police said they had received a formal complaint against BJP MP Ram Chander Jangra over his controversial statement on social media. Police said they were discussing the matter with a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/2-days-after-bjp-mps-remark-on-farm-stir-mehan-man-files-complaint/articleshow/81639828.cms||Sat Singh

Syed Feroz Ali, a document writer, and Bhanu Prakash, a DTP operator, were arrested and two Rs 100 non-judicial stamp papers, ten Rs 100 non-judicial stamp papers which were erased, 2,500 stamp papers, a rubber stamp making machine, document-erasing liquid bottles, hair dryer and other objects were recovered. Police said that Syed Ali was a repeat offender, who was arrested twice in the past for a similar offence. During the lockdown, Syed Ali, who was facing a financial crisis, came in contact with Bhanu Prakash, who was a licensed stamp vendor in Saroornagar. His stamp vendor licence, however, expired in 2018. Syed Ali used to procure old written or blank non-judicial stamp papers through various sources. After procuring the old stamp papers, he used to erase all the written matter and turn it into a plain document, using ink removers. Subsequently, these documents were handed over to Bhanu Prakash.

---||Delhi||BJP, Congress slam govt for lowering drinking age in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Both BJP and Congress hit out at the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government on Monday over its decision to reduce the drinking age in the capital from 25 to 21 years, while also privatising all liquor vends. While Congress said this was a move towards making Delhi “nashe ki rajdhani” (the capital of intoxication), BJP said it would promote the private liquor mafia. Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president Chaudhary Anil Kumar said, “The privatisation move will open the doors for spurious liquor. Delhi government’s bid to mop up 20% more revenue from liquor sales (from the current Rs 6,000 crore to Rs 7,500 crore) is a retrograde step. It will lead the youth astray and they will become addicted.” “Instead of tightening the liquor policy to make the capital safer for women and keeping the youth away from substance abuse, the new excise policy will only bring ruin to Delhi, all for the sake of a few crores more revenue,” added Kumar. Leader of Opposition in Delhi assembly, BJP’s Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, said the new excise policy was wrong and arbitrary, which could also lead to a possible spike in the crime rate. “In addition to Delhi having the dubious distinction of being the most-polluted capital in the world, it will soon be labelled as the liquor capital of the country too,” he added. “The new policy will encourage consumption of liquor, which is unfortunate. It will also lead to the supply of spurious liquor as there is no guarantee about the quality being provided by the private vends. Thousands of government employees associated with liquor vends are now facing uncertainty,” said Bidhuri. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta described it as a “black day” in Delhi’s history. “The AAP government took this decision for its own political funding. The reduction of liquor consumption age may be non-objectionable under law, but it is morally wrong. It seems the Kejriwal government is bent on pushing Delhi’s youths towards liquor,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-congress-slam-govt-for-lowering-drinking-age-in-city/articleshow/81639841.cms||---

The technology transfer to Virchow Biotech is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021 followed by full-scale commercial production of Sputnik V, RDIF said on Monday. Virchow Biotech’s capacities will help facilitate global supply of Sputnik V, the world’s first registered vaccine against Covid-19, to international partners of RDIF, it added. Pointing out that vaccine partnerships are the only way to overcome the pandemic, RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev said there is a “growing interest in Sputnik V vaccine as it is one of the most efficient vaccines available. The agreement with Virchow Biotech is an important step to facilitate the full-scale local production of the vaccine in India and to supply our international partners globally”. Virchow Biotech managing director Tummuru Murali said the company’s capabilities in large scale drug substance manufacturing would help meet the global demand for the vaccine. According to RDIF, Sputnik V, which has shown a 91.6% efficacy, has so far been registered in 54 countries globally with a total population of over 1.4 billion and is awaiting emergency use authorisation (EUA) from the Indian drug regulator, Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sputnik-virchow-biotech-in-pact-to-make-200m-doses/articleshow/81639187.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Delhi||Delhi lowers drinking age: Restaurants happy to see hiccups out of their way||NEW DELHI: Till last week, restaurateur Zorawar Kalra’s big wish, among many, was for Delhi’s legal age of drinking to be 21 years instead of 25. On Monday, he was optimistic of establishing more such world-class outlets like his spanking new one offering a great view of Qutub Minar if the government kept coming up with business-friendly policies. Within seconds of deputy chief minister Sisodia proclaiming the reduction of the legal age for alcohol consumption in Delhi to 21 years, social media exploded with celebratory posts welcoming the “revolutionary” move. Messages hailed the decision, with restaurants relieved there wouldn’t be excise raids to detect underaged drinking, while memes gleefully talked of imbibers no longer needing to fake their IDs or surreptitiously sip in the dark. Priyank Sukhija of First Fiddle Restaurants, who has for long demanded a lower drinking age in the city, said the announcement came at an opportune time. The food industry is battling and hasn’t yet recovered from Covid restrictions and this decision will give people like him the hope to stay afloat, he said. Akshay Anand of Ophelia and Toy Room noted that Delhi Restaurant Association had apprised Delhi government of how a lot of business was going to neighbouring states, where the legal age of drinking is lower. The reduction of the bar to 21 years will improve the standing of Delhi as a progressive place to party in, he said. His business will go up by almost 20% because this was what he lost when denying entry to so many in the 21-25 age group, revealed Kanishk Tureja of We Qutub and Nukkad Café. He added that young 21-year-olds could now step into their favourite bars in the city without fear and even parents wouldn’t be wary of sending their ‘kids’ out because they wouldn’t be doing anything illegal by imbibing alcohol. Deepak Tandon of Wok in the Clouds hoped this would encourage youngsters to drink in licensed spaces rather than in seedy areas and thus boost the revenues of both the state government and restaurants. He also felt the decision opened the way for talented youngsters to work as mixologists at a younger age. Restaurateur Dinesh Arora similarly opined that the lowering of drinking age would lead to an increase of revenue for the state while doing away with the risk of pubs and eateries being raided. Arora now wished to see the operating hours extended to 3am, service rules relaxed and permission granted for the use of open spaces on the restaurant premises at no extra fee. Such decisions and a liberal excise policy will make the city a model state for others in terms of a thriving restaurant business and active nightlife, Arora said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/restaurants-happy-to-see-hiccups-out-of-their-way/articleshow/81639837.cms||Amin Ali
---||Delhi||Proposal for engineered landfill site at Tehkhand given a fresh push||New Delhi: A fresh proposal for setting up an engineered landfill site at a 32-acre plot in Tehkhand was placed before South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s standing committee meeting on Monday. While the project was approved in 2018, it got delayed due to last-minute changes in the plan and a few other reasons. The project now includes utilising five acres of earmarked sanitary landfill site as a material recovery centre. The revised project is scheduled to be completed in 18 months and will take pressure off the Okhla landfill. While the Centre and state governments have agreed to fund 35% and 12% of the project cost, respectively, SDMC has signed a contract with Indian Oil Corporation to provide the rest of the funds under a CSR initiative or under the municipal head of account. The cost of the modified project will be Rs 55.5 crore. “SDMC generates 3,600 metric tonnes of waste every day, of which a part is dumped at a sanitary landfill at Okhla. It is not in a position to take more burden, which is why we are keen to implement the engineered landfill project soon. We have got in-principle approval regarding funding of projects as part of Swachh Bharat Mission. But if there would be any financial issue, then we may need to look for alternative arrangements,” said SDMC leader of House Narendra Chawla.

The mill owes about Rs 102 crore of sugarcane payments to farmers of Ambala region from the ongoing season of 2020-21 and owes about Rs 3 crore from the last season. The protest was held under leadership of BKU Haryana (Charuni) Ambala district president Malkiat Singh Sahibpura and Ganna Sangharsh Samiti (GSS) president Vinod Rana. Earlier in the day, the Haryana government appointed chief executive officer (CEO) Narender Malik reached the protest spot and informed the farmers that the request for pledge money had been rejected by the Harco Bank and the mill would be able to clear the payments only after its stock is sold. On March 10, farmers had held a protest meeting outside the mill and confined the mill officials while demanding payment. They had relented only after the management promised to clear the dues by March 20, provided the mill managed to get a pledge money loan on the basis of sugar stock available with it. Sahibpura said, “The mill failed to clear payment, as it promised in the last meeting... So far, the mill has cleared payments of up to January 6 and owes about Rs 102 crore to the cane growers.” Naraingarh sub-division magistrate Vaishali Sharma said, “We cannot tell when the sugar will be sold, as it depends on the market situation. I have highlighted the matter at the level of chief minister, to provide some financial assistance so that the dues of farmers are cleared. He (CM) has asked for two-three days’ time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/naraingarh-mill-fails-to-clear-cane-dues-farmers-block-highway/articleshow/81639844.cms||---

More than 70 houses have been razed down in the last four days as curfew continued in the area for the second day. “Situation remains peaceful. We have conducted meetings with locals and they too are ready to cooperate. As of today, the curfew will continue,” Vidisha SP Vinayak Verma told TOI. Police have also rounded up around 17 people for rioting. Police and local administration have razed around 67 properties that were built on forest land in the last four days. “More than 150 hectares of encroached land has been cleared and remaining would be cleared soon,” said SDM Tanmay Verma. Officials say that around 350 ha area of forest has been encroached upon and sold by the accused to different people. Inquiry is on against the forest officials accountable for securing the land. Curfew was imposed in areas under Murwas police station of Vidisha District, as precautionary measure following tension between two groups after murder of a 48-year old man by another family following a complaint of encroachment on forest land. Santram Valmiki, husband of Murwas Gram Panchayat sarpanch was mowed down by a tractor on Thursday. He had filed a complaint with collector Pankaj Jain on September 10 last year accusing some people of encroaching upon acres of forest land in Vidisha's Lateri town. Taking cognisance of his complaint, the collector had asked the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) to probe the matter. Santram was crushed to death by a tractor – a day before the administration's anti-encroachment drive - when he was returning to his house from the Murwas panchayat bhavan. Santram was on his bike and the tractor was driven by son of the accused. Santram was taken to hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.

The division bench of Justice SS Shinde and Justice Manish Pitale asked Thakare to take instructions from the police and inform the court since it said it is finally hearing a petition filed by Republic TV’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and his company ARG Outlier Media to quash the FIR in the TRP case or to transfer the probe to the CBI. “The law does not state when you should end the investigation, we are not saying end it in a month but give us a rough estimate,” said the court. “We can understand if there are absconding accused or if material from other states is required to be procured. But for you, everything is right here.”  Goswami’s counsel Ashok Mundargireiterated that the cops intentionally did not name Goswami an accused to keep the “harass’’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-specify-time-trp-probe-will-take-to-wrap-up-hc/articleshow/81639855.cms||---

Students have to submit their request to their school management for a change in the examination centre, who in turn, would have to submit the request to the board. No change in centre would be allowed once the request is submitted. “Because of Covid some students of class 10 and class 12 along with their families have shifted to some other city/country and therefore, they are unable to appear in the practical examination/theory examination from the school/examination centre from where students are registered for board examination,” the board said. Students can request either change of practical examination centre or theory or both. In case, a student requests for change of both centres, both will be changed to one city. Two separate centres will not be allowed. They will have to send requests to their school by March 25 and schools will upload them by March 31. “Right now, all our students are back in the city and will be appearing for the exams from here,” said Simi Nagi, principal, Pallavi Model School, Alwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cbse-allows-students-to-change-their-exam-centres/articleshow/81650259.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Tata, SpiceJet promoter shortlisted for AI bids||Mumbai/New Delhi: Tata Group and SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh have been shortlisted for the bid to buy out Air India, people familiar with the development have told TOI. The two will now have to submit their financial bids after completing due diligence on the national carrier’s books, agreements and liabilities, report Reeba Zachariah and Saurabh Sinha.  In their financial bids, the parties have to state the quantum of AI’s debt they will be willing to take up and the upfront payment they will make for the asset. Whoever quotes the highest economic value for AI will be the winner of the bid. At least 15% of AI’s enterprise value has to be paid in cash and the balance can be taken as debt. AI has a debt of over Rs 90,000 crore. It is estimated that the national carrier would report a Rs 10,000 crore loss this fiscal. While Tata Group will be putting in its bid through AirAsia India, in which it holds a controlling stake, Singh has firmed up plans with a Middle East sovereign fund for the acquisition, it is learned. Singh—who coined the famous “ab ki baar Modi sarkaar” slogan ahead of the 2014 general elections—or his spokesperson offered no comments on the report. Sources said that Tata Group has been wooing its Southeast Asian full-service carrier partner Singapore Airlines to come on board for the AI bid. The conglomerate and Singapore Airlines run Vistara in India but the latter has shown an unenthusiastic response for AI as the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted its balance sheet. Industry has been speculating that AI would most likely go to the Tata Group. India’s largest conglomerate, which also owns Jaguar Land Rover, originally founded AI in 1932 but sold its interests to the government in 1953. The group’s AI bid indicates its commitment to the air transport business; and the acquisition will ramp up its ambitions of emerging a significant player in the aviation sector. The government hopes to complete the AI divestment by the second quarter of next fiscal. It is expected that the government will handhold the AI winner in the initial transition period when they anticipate trouble from unions and other stakeholders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/tata-spicejet-promoter-shortlisted-for-ai-bids/articleshow/81640467.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The administration ordered closing of all restaurants and other eating places by 11pm. The last order can be taken till 10pm. Besides, all Holi gatherings will be banned. Clubs, hotels and restaurants will host no Holi milan parties. All eateries will run only with 50% capacity. Times ViewAs Covid cases surge and many people remain oblivious to the need for following standard protocol, curbs had to be imposed to rein in the numbers and help contain the rising infection. However, in order to be effective, these need to be enforced strictly, else these won’t help either. With the return of a possible second wave, perhaps people will realise the need to adhere to mandated safeguards.The decisions were taken in the review meeting chaired by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore. The administration appealed to the residents to celebrate Holi at home while following Covid protocol. The administration also ordered that all schools, colleges and other educational institutions will remain closed till March 31. The state museums, libraries, auditoriums and theatres run by the administration will remain closed till further orders. It was also decided in the meeting that no new permission will be granted for holding any exhibition or fair and all those allowed earlier may continue as per their scheduled programme. A permission from the deputy commissioner will be mandatory for holding any event, including political, social or even wedding. The number of guests will be restricted by the DC. Badnore suggested that contact tracing should be intensified and all those who came in contact with a corona positive case must be mandatorily tested. He also mentioned that visitors reaching Chandigarh by bus, train, air and other public transport modes should be invariably screened. It was also decided to do strict monitoring at crowded places, like Sukhna Lake, apni mandis, markets and shopping malls. The UT administration issued directions to municipal corporation authorities to allow vegetable and fruit vendors to sell produce in carts by visiting various residential areas to reduce crowd in apni mandis and the wholesale market in Sector 26. The administration has also appealed that hosts of various events must ensure that all guests wear masks, and wherever necessary, distribute them. The administrator appealed to the councillors, office-bearers of market associations and residents’ welfare associations and other public leaders to motivate people to get themselves tested and vaccinated. He asked medical authorities to ensure that they were ready to handle the increasing number of Covid patients coming to hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-orders-closing-of-eateries-by-11pm-no-holi-gatherings/articleshow/81639207.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Hyderabad||Allow 100% theatre occupancy: Telugu film industry||HYDERABAD: The Telugu film industry is not in favour of reducing theatre occupancy in the wake of rising Covid cases in the state. The film industry bounced back with a couple of hits in recent times after recovering from the Covid restrictions. “There is 100% occupancy in theatres for films. At this juncture, the government should not think of reducing occupancy,” Telangana state film chamber of commerce president K Muralimohan said. Film theatres were shut due to Covid between March and December 2020, . Initially while 50% occupancy was allowed, later 100% occupancy was permitted. Single theatre owners and also multiplexes reported that there has been good response to cinema as such. As many as four films released on a single day on March 19 and some of them had waited only for theatres to open so that they could have a theatrical release. Some film-makers are going out of their way to tell audiences that they do not intend to release films on OTT and that they should enjoy the films on the big screen. The Telugu film industry looks busy as films starring some big heroes are expected to be released especially during April-May-June as the holiday season for students brings a large percentage of audience to watch films. “If any restrictions are imposed on the occupancy again, big budget films which are planning a theatrical release during the summer months will take a beating. Since Covid vaccination is also being done and the number of people getting vaccinated is also more, theatres should be allowed to function with 100% occupancy,” Muralimohan said. Theatres owners said they were strictly adhering to Covid norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/allow-100-theatre-occupancy-industry/articleshow/81639206.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The village panchayat is now seeking the chief minister’s intervention while Adampur SAD MLA Panwan Teenu met PSPCL chief engineer on Monday and submitted a memorandum, seeking a bill waiver and resuming supply to the farmer’s house. Bhupinder Singh, 52, of Bolina village, had gone to the Delhi border along with other farmers to participate in the tractor parade on January 26 but died there. His son Hardeep Singh, 24, said that power connection in their house, which was snapped on March 18, was in name of his great grandfather and their power bill piled up due to some glitches. “In December, we were given notice to pay the entire amount within a fortnight but we did not have the money. We got Rs five lakh after the death of my father but a major chunk of that money had to be spent on my sister’s illness and on some other household works needing urgent attention. We could not pay the Rs 3.5 lakh bill amount,” he said. The family, which has a 1.5 acre landholding, has been charging inverter-battery at another house in the village for use at night. PSPCL SDO Shamsher Singh said the electricity bill was due for a long time and they were left with no option but to cut the supply as the family failed to deposit the money despite several notices. Village sarpanch Kulwinder Singh said the chief minister should intervene into the matter as the family was barely able to make both ends and now their power connection had been cut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rs-3-5l-arrears-pspcl-cuts-supply-to-house-of-farmer-who-died-at-singhu-protest/articleshow/81639857.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Endowments commissioner Arjuna Rao has directed temple executive officers (EO) to implement Covid-19 protocols and permit devotees in limited numbers. Under the ‘anna danam’ initiative, around 25,000 devotees are fed every day in temples across the state, excluding Tirumala Tirupati Devastanams (TTD). Thousands of devotees also make contributions to help the food distribution initiative. As the number of cases started to come down, officials had restored the Anna Danam initiative across all temples on February 4 in accordance to Covid-19 guidelines. Prominent temples such as the Kanaka Durga temple in the city, Sri Venkateswara Swamy temple at Dwaraka Tirumala, Sri Satyanarayana Swamy temple at Annavaram, Sri Subramanyeswara Swamy temple at Mopidevi have stopped food distribution in closed halls starting Monday. Instead, officials started distribution of food packets to devotees. “Around 5,000 devotees eat meals at the dining hall in the temple every day. But we reduced that number due to Covid-19. We are now distributing 4,000 food packets to devotees. Similarly, we have stopped issuing darshan tickets at counters. One should book a time slot online and directly come for darshan,” Kanaka Durga temple executive officer, MV Suresh Babu said. Major temples across the state have cancelled VIP darshans and are implementing Muka-Mandapa darshan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/endowments-dept-pauses-anna-danam-amid-spike-in-covid-cases/articleshow/81637698.cms||Venu Lanka

The team submitted its findings to DM Kanwal Tanuj, recently. The traffic trolleys should be made available on the east and west flanks of Kosi-Kataria bridge near Kursela for controlling the speed of vehicles. An arterial road opens up on NH-31 at Khaira Mor. Rumble strips should be constructed 100 metres away from NH-31 and Khaira Mor junction. Besides, a stop line or signage must be put up on the arterial road, 10 metres away from the junction point, the report stated. “We have written to project director, NHAI, and expect immediate response from their side. We expect the NH team visit soon,” the DM said. The team also recommended ‘speed limit boards’ as well as ‘transverse bar marking’ on NH-31 at Musapur Chowk near Chetharia Pir, Phulwaria Mor, Basgarha Mor, Dummar Chowk, 200 metres ahead of Sameli block towards Kursela as well as 200 metres before Sameli block, near Dummar. Also, the 500-metre-long median on the NH-31 near Gerabari needs repair, the report suggested. ‘Speed detecting devices’ and CCTV cameras must be installed on NH-31 near Korha police station for the monitoring of vehicular traffic. Besides, rumble strips must be constructed on Kosi-Kataria and Chetharia Pir bridges while overtaking of vehicles must be curtailed on both the bridges,” the report stated. The panel also suggested setting up of ‘dedicated highway patrolling cum rescue team’, ensuring 24x7 ambulance services at the PHCs, giving fresh coat of paint to tree trunks along the NH-31 as well as road marking from Kursela to the district’s outer limit on the NH-31, because the coating on the highway is omitted at several places. “The NH-31 lacks road signage. Besides, road safety audit must be done by Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), New Delhi, or other central agencies,” the report suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/katihar-team-suggests-steps-to-check-accidents-on-nh-31/articleshow/81638272.cms||---

On Monday, Thorat and public works minister Ashok Chavan called on chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to discuss the political situation arising out of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s ‘letter bomb’ against Deshmukh. “Thackeray is weighing all options, he is not in a hurry to take a decision. Besides Congress, Thackeray will discuss the matter with Pawar too before taking a final decision,” a senior Congress minister told TOI. “In view of Pawar’s statement in Delhi, it appears that NCP is in no mood to sack Deshmukh. Thackeray has expressed the view that it was for the NCP to take a decision.” Deshmukh too has asked for a free and fair probe. A senior NCP cabinet member felt that Singh’s letter appears to be politically motivated. “He has made allegations of corruption and extortion against Deshmukh, but there is no evidence. Deshmukh will sue him. We will not be surprised if Singh joins a political party in the days to come,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaimva-core-panel-cm-to-decide-fate-of-home-min/articleshow/81639859.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Officials also seized a register with details of financial transactions from arrested inspector Sachin Waze’s office at the police headquarters. The letter, to Mukesh and his wife Nita, was written in broken English. In the letter, the scare was called a trailer and warned that explosives would be in assembled form next time.

---||Chandigarh||Mohali: Killer Mercedes car was challaned twice in 4 months||By: Piyush SarnaMOHALI: The Mercedes-Benz car, which claimed three lives after crashing into a taxi and a cycle near Radha Soami traffic light-point on the airport road in Mohali on March 20, was challaned twice in the past four months. The UT police said the car was challaned for dangerous driving in Chandigarh on March 13. The challan was issued to Ravneet Singh for “dangerous driving, passing or overtaking other vehicles in a manner contrary to law”. Times ViewPowerful cars and teenagers’ lack of driving experience, coupled with their risk-taking behavior, heightens their risk of crashes. There is a need to invest in skill-building and driving supervision of such new drivers, which also calls for parental and societal intervention. The importance of following rules cannot be emphasised enough. Guardians have to ensure that the new drivers know everything about road safety rules before they get behind the wheel.The same car was issued the slip for speeding in UT on December 1, 2020, too. The challan was issued in the name of ‘M/S Weldon’ for “driving at faster / excessive speed than speed limits by LMV / other act” under sections 112, 183 and 188 of the MV Act. The car owner, however, has failed to pay the two challans. Meanwhile, the 18-year-old accused, Samrat, was produced in a local court on Monday. “He has been sent in two-day police remand,” said a cop. The other two accused, Prabhnoor and Arjun who accompanied Samrat, are at large. Mohali SSP Satinder Singh said, “I appeal to all parents as well as children that they should not take law in their hands.” Samrat, who didn’t have a driving licence and was drunk, was at the wheel at the time of the accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/killer-mercedes-car-was-challaned-twice-in-4-mths/articleshow/81639222.cms||---

Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointed out wastage of vaccines and later Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan clarified that Telangana’s Covid vaccine wastage was the highest in the country at 17 %, the state health authorities have written to the Centre, explaining that the vaccine wastage in the state was lowest in the country. “Based on the portals maintained by the Government of India, we have calculated the numbers and our wastage is just 0.76 %. the claim made by the GOI is completely wrong,” Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health, Telangana said on Monday. “After Centre’s claim, we have gone through all our records, including manual records and we have come to an understanding that our wastage percentage is less than 1 % ,” Rao said, adding the state authorities are now awaiting an answer from the Centre after having pointed out the grave mistake. A day after Centre’s remark, Telangana started releasing vaccine wastage data daily in its bulletin, showing 1.22 % to 0.76 % wastage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-counters-centre-vax-wastage-0-76/articleshow/81639221.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Don’t drop that mask even if your vaccination is complete||CHANDIGARH: Health experts at PGI say it is time to get back to the strict adherence of wearing face masks even after complete vaccination against Covid-19. “It is a social responsibility to adhere to these norms as the government cannot check the spread with punitive actions,” says Prof Madhu Gupta from the department of community medicine school for public health, PGIMER. The experts believe that as there is a surge in Punjab, there are active infections and hence easy transmission. “Those who got vaccinated are not 100% protected and masks offer 95-99% safety in preventing the transmission,” she adds. “Unless 60-70% of the population is vaccinated, the chain of transmission cannot be broken. Out of 130 crore, about four crore have been vaccinated in the country. So we should not remove masks,” says Prof Madhu, who was the principal investigator in PGIMER for Covishield trials in the country. Commenting on the government of India’s directions to all the states and UTs to increase the interval between two doses of Covishield to six to eight weeks instead of 28 days, Prof Madhu says, “We had been waiting for these guidelines, as we had evidence over the past one month that the gap will enhance antibodies’ level.” Experts say masks are the only way to prevent aerosol transmission, which may cause the most severe cases of respiratory infections like influenza and Covid. “Hand washing and social distancing can largely prevent transmission by contact and droplets, but these methods are much less effective against aerosol transmission. The mask is also more beneficial when a disease gets transmitted by asymptomatic carriers. Many SARS-CoV-2 infections are transmitted by people who are asymptomatic,” says Prof Madhu in her study on regular usage of face masks that can flatten the curve. Countries, like Japan and Hong Kong that have recommended the use of masks, have been relatively more successful in reducing the spread of infection than Europe and the US.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dont-drop-that-mask-even-if-you-are-jabbed/articleshow/81639224.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Hyderabad||Covid infected now show symptoms of common cold||HYDERABAD: As opposed to the first wave when cough and fever were primary symptoms of Covid-19, people with common cold are now increasingly testing positive for the infection. “Oddly, having common cold, running nose and sneezing are now major symptoms of Covid-19, which was not there earlier. Most mildly symptomatic patients are presenting with common cold, sneezing, dry cough and mild fever. It could be because of weather change or mutation in the virus that we are seeing more asymptomatic cases. It is possible that the virus is stronger now due to the seasonal changes,” director public health, Dr G Srinivasa Rao, said. Dr Sanjoy Paul of Apollo Sugar clinics, Srinagar Colony, said, “The four to five cases recently diagnosed at my clinic have presented asymptotic mild flu-like symptoms with no CT findings. However, RTPCR tests have been positive. Without increased inflammatory markers, it’s just like common cold.” Speaking about how atypical symptoms have increased, Dr Rahul Agarwal, a general physician who has seen over 4,000 Covid-19 cases so far since the pandemic, said, “We are getting a lot of people with abdominal symptoms of Covid-19 — along with common cold and cough — like diarrhoea, stomach ache and bloating. Due to this difference in presentation, we have to be more alert for Covid-19 in such patients.” Interestingly, stomach ailments were among the vague symptoms of Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic; while cough, cold, fever and breathlessness were common symptoms. It might be indicative of the virus affecting the digestive symptom along with the respiratory system. The novel coronavirus, meanwhile, is primarily a respiratory disease and impairs the lung functioning. It also impacts neurological and cardiac functions in patients. “While we are seeing a spike in cases in our hospital. We have noticed that most patients getting admitted for lung infections are later being diagnosed as Covid positive,” said Dr Kiran Madala, incharge head of department of critical care at Nizamabad Medical College, where most cases were coming from districts bordering neighbouring states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-infected-now-show-symptoms-of-common-cold/articleshow/81639227.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Mumbai||Maratha quota: SC told about ‘absolute political consensus’||Justifying its decision to bring Marathas within the ambit of reservation, the Maharashtra government on Monday told the Supreme Court that there is “absolute political consensus” in the state and all parties are in favour of it. Senior advocate Paramjit Patwalia, appearing for the state, told a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Najeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat that Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act was passed unanimously in the assembly and all parties supported the law. He said all 288 MLAs voted in favour of the law regardless of political affiliation and whether they belonged to the reserved or general category. Similarly, there were 78 members in the legislative council and all supported the law, he said. Refuting the allegation that the Gaikwad Commission, which had recommended reservation for Marathas, was biased, the state government said there were several members from the upper castes, yet the recommendations were unanimous. The commission filed its report after holding extensive interactions with people from different walks of life, it added. Patwalia said Justice Gaikwad’s background and credentials cannot be questioned and neither can that of the other members of the panel. A separate quota was created for Marathas as including them within the OBC category would have been of no benefit, he added. Marathas were considered as socially and educationally backward since 1901 till 1953. Even the Kalelkar commission identified Marathas as OBC but it was rejected by the Centre and since then, Marathas were kept out of the reservation policy, he said. The state government had framed the law on November 30, 2018, granting 16% quota for Marathas in government jobs and admission in educational institutions. While upholding the law, the Bombay HC on June 27 last year directed the government to bring it down to 12% for education and 13% for jobs as suggested by the Gaikwad panel. Challenging the HC order, petitioners against the quota contended the HC had misread SC judgments to conclude there is no stringent limit of 50% reservation as set out in the 1992 Indra Sawhney case. The state government countered that there was no illegality in giving reservation to the Maratha community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maratha-quota-sc-told-about-absolute-political-consensus-in-maharashtra/articleshow/81639880.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Delhi||Know All About Bhagat Singh’s Struggle In His Very Own Corner||New Delhi: From allocating Rs 10 crore in the state budget to organising a special event on the martyrdom of Bhagat Singh on March 23 at Central Park in Connaught Place, Delhi government has been carrying on from 2018 when Delhi Archives started a Bhagat Singh Archives and Resource Centre. With thousands of books, documents, journals and archival materials, including the socialist revolutionary’s jail records, the resource centre has become a primary source for researchers interested in Bhagat Singh’s life. The centre was conceptualised by professor Chaman Lal, formerly of Jawaharlal Nehru University. He is an expert on Singh and has been collecting books, journals and documents and resource material on the revolutionary and his comrades from archives and universities across the world. “When I proposed the formation of this centre, I gave away nearly 2,000 books on Bhagat Singh in various Indian languages,” said Lal, now an advisor at the centre. Delhi Archives will use such pictures and materials to form panels at the ‘Ek shaam shaheedon ke naam’ function at Central Park as part of the series of state government events. The Twitter profile of the archives has been posting a few of these pictures since Sunday, March 22. “The materials that we have are either sourced from places like National Archives of India, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, Ghadar Archives of Berkeley Campus in University of California, British Library in London and from sources like Desh Bhagat Yadgar Hall, Jalandhar,” said Lal. “The collection also has five manuscripts of Shiv Verma, a close comrade of Bhagat Singh.” Lal would like the centre given more publicity “so that researchers and those in the academia studying about the revolutionary Indian freedom struggle can use the resources here.” He said, “Bhagat Singh is an icon and such icons can have multiple interpretations. But we must always understand them through their ideas and through authentic historical records.” Sanjay Garg, chief archivist at Delhi Archives, told TOI, “We plan to expand the resource centre into a body where all materials on Bhagat Singh, be it books, archival materials or secondary sources, are brought on one platform to be used by future researchers.” As for the push for Bhagat Singh by the state government and Delhi Archives, Garg said that it was “necessary for today’s youth to learn about the life and struggle of the freedom fighter”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/know-all-about-bhagat-singhs-struggle-in-his-very-own-corner/articleshow/81639932.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

As many as 208 Covid-19 cases were reported on Monday. Since March 17, there have been over 200 active cases in the city daily. “This was what we had seen during September, when there were over 200 cases daily. It was expected that after the antibodies fade, there will be a surge. But these numbers were not expected,” said a public health expert. With the weekly positivity rate of 9.9%, the city stands next to Maharashtra in the country. The tests per million per day in the city is 1,954, the national average is 650.5. “Though 65% of the cases have been coming from Maharashtra, Punjab has also been contributing to the rise,” the expert said. “These numbers have been increasing daily, but we have also enhanced our testing. We have been going to schools, but students refuse RT-PCR,” said UT director, health services, Dr Amandeep Kang, adding, “Some of the teachers were found positive during testing.” On Monday, UT administrator VP Badnore directed the PGIMER to enhance sample testing to 1,200 per day, of which at least 600 samples should be accepted as sent by the UT administration. Sources said by next month, vaccination against Covid might expand to those above 45 years without any health problems. “If this trend of increasing cases continues, things will be beyond management. Moreover, people are not abiding by protocols,” said the health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/weekly-positivity-rate-hikes-from-7-6-to-9-9-208-cases-reported/articleshow/81639225.cms||Shimona Kanwar

One of the employees, identified as 55-year-old Subramaniam, was carrying a gun as well. A flying squad official said the cash and the gun were seized during a vehicle check at Kulatheri in Singanallur assembly constituency on Monday. “The employees said the cash was meant for refilling various ATMs in the city. They, however, did not possess any valid documents for the amount. We seized the cash and handed it over to Singanallur assembly constituency returning officer S Ramkumar,” the official said. Ramkumar said the amount would be deposited in the district treasury at the collectorare. “The private firm that is engaged in filling cash in ATMs can get back the amount after submitting valid documents.” When asked about the gun that one of the employees of the cash management agency was carrying, the squad official said the accused had reportedly borrowed it from a colleague named Nagalingam for the money transfer. “We have arrested them both and lodged in jail under judicial custody.” Thirty flying squads and as many static surveillance teams have been functioning round the clock in the 10 assembly constituencies in the district to ensure a free and fair poll since the model code of conduct came into force. In another instance, the Tirupur city police on Monday evening seized around Rs 1.11 crore from a minivan during a vehicle check at Kulathupalayam check post. A police officer said, “The vehicle driver said the cash belonged to a Kerala-based jewellery firm and he was taking the cash to deposit in a bank. But he did not have any valid documents for the amount.” Police have handed over the vehicle along with the cash to Tirupur North taluk office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/poll-squad-seizes-rs-1cr-meant-to-refill-atms/articleshow/81639229.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||After rural Goa, BJP sweeps urban bodies, registers big win in Panaji||PANAJI: With state assembly elections less than a year away, BJP added to their victories in zilla panchayat just three months ago with sweeping success in polls for seven urban local bodies, including the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP). Elections were held on Saturday. When votes were counted on Monday, BJP-backed panels emerged triumphant in six of the seven urban local bodies. The only setback was in Cuncolim, where opposition Congress triumphed. Congress, though, had little else to celebrate. After winning just four of the 48 zilla panchayat seats in December when BJP picked up 33, their cup of woes is now overflowing with loss even in its bastion of Navelim. Represented by Congress heavyweight and former chief minister Luizinho Faleiro, the party’s state Mahila chief, Pratima Coutinho, finished second behind independent candidate Edwin Cardozo. Everywhere else, it was BJP-backed panels who triumphed. “Issues were raised by political parties and NGOs, but BJP-backed candidates were elected because voters trust the party. We will win with a majority in next year’s assembly elections too,” said chief minister Pramod Sawant. Besides the all-important CCP, BJP won Valpoi, Bicholim, Pernem, Canacona and Curchorem-Cacora. Candidates backed by the party won all 10 wards in Valpoi, all 12 wards in Canacona, nine out of 14 in Bicholim, six out of 10 in Pernem, 11 out of 15 in Curchorem and 25 out of 30 in Panaji. “BJP won 85 wards out of 105,” said BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade. “Loss in Cuncolim (municipality) is my responsibility. We will introspect, and in 2022, BJP will win the Cuncolim assembly seat.” In 2017 state assembly polls, Cuncolim was won by Congress candidate Clafasio Dias, who later switched over to BJP. Congress’ win in nine out of the 14 wards is largely due to the efforts of former Congress minister Joaquim Alemao and his son Yuri, who is now a strong aspirant for the party ticket. But the chief minister suffered a personal setback on his home turf, when his nominee lost to a Congress supporter in the Sakhali municipal council bypolls. In Cuncolim, the chief minister’s brother-in-law, Videsh Dessai, tasted success. Interestingly, all seven municipal council areas are represented by BJP in the state assembly. However, in five constituencies, the legislators had switched over from Congress and MGP in mid-2019. Of the 12 urban local bodies, five municipal councils are yet to face election as the Supreme Court upheld the high court order cancelling the election due to irregularities in reservation of wards. “We want to take up development work in municipal areas over the next year. Funds from the 15th Finance Commission will be given to municipalities,” said Sawant. Political observers said it was obvious that BJP-supported panels would succeed in municipal elections as there was no strong opposition, though there was simmering resentment against the ruling party due to delimitation and reservation of wards. “BJP has always had an edge in urban areas, and with MLAs of the same party it helps them to get comfortable victory in municipal elections,” a political observer said. Internal party politics had come to the fore in Panaji where local BJP MLA Atanasio Monserrate aimed to win all 30 seats. His dream didn’t come to fruition as the rival, ‘We Ponjekar’, panel won four seats, which included those of former mayor Surendra Furtado and wife Ruth. “I didn’t lose five seats (in Panaji) due to BJP rebels,” said Monserrate. “It is my fault, my sole responsibility. I did not campaign in these three wards.” In a fiercely-fought battle in 2015, the Monserrate panel locked horns with Manohar Parrikar, then defence minister, and won 15 seats to retain control of the corporation. But with Monserrate now switching over to BJP, there was little opposition. His son Rohit was among the BJP-backed candidates who won the polls. Like Panaji, in most municipalities, BJP-backed panels won with comfortable margins. There was some concern in Pernem where the party won six of the 10 wards, and then took the support of two independents. “Municipal results in Pernem could be a reflection of anti-incumbency against deputy chief minister Manohar Ajgaonkar. Even then he managed to win the election. Ajgaonkar was also able to win both zilla panchayat seats in December,” another political observer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-rural-goa-bjp-sweeps-urban-bodies-registers-big-win-in-panaji/articleshow/81639867.cms||Murari Shetye

This took the total number of cases to 57,267. With only 52 people getting discharged, the number of active cases continued to rise to 768. The district also recorded two deaths due to the virus, taking the death toll to 688. The day also saw the emergence of four family clusters and an increase in the number of containment zones to 18. Officials say that family clusters contributed to 12 cases, including a family of four from PNR Layout on Trichy Road, another family of four from TNHB Colony at Rajiv Gandhi Nagar and a family of three from Periyar Nagar in MK Palayam. “While the corporation has seven containment zones, the remaining 11 are from rural areas,” an official said. While Anna Nagar Makkal Needhi Maiyam candidate V Ponraj announcing that he tested positive on Monday, politicians on the campaign trail seem yet to learn a lesson. In a statement, Ponraj said he suffered symptoms like body pain and fever almost four days back. He was in Coimbatore on Friday for the release of his party’s manifesto and accompanied MNM founder-president Kamal Haasan, for a press conference and a closed-door meeting with industrialists. TOI has photos of Ponraj standing next to Kamal Haasan and Singanallur MNM candidate Mahendran without wearing a mask. Over the next three days, Haasan, who has received only his first shot of Covishield, was seen campaigning in Amman Kulam, travelling on buses, visiting crowded places like Poo Market, Puliakulam and restaurants. TOI has photos of him doing all the above, after being exposed to Ponraj, without wearing a mask. Meanwhile, one of the MNM PROs kept repeating to TOI despite the photo evidence that their “leaders have been wearing masks since day one”. It is not only MNM candidates. Ironically, municipal administration minister S P Velumani who keeps appealing to people to wear masks was caught campaigning without wearing a mask in his constituency. AIADMK Singanallur candidate Jayaraman too was seen campaigning on Monday without masks. BJP candidate for Coimbatore South constituency Vanathi Sreenivasan despite Modi’s continuous requests to people to wear masks is seen in public without a mask. DMK leader M K Stalin who appeals to his party workers to wear masks during meetings and campaigns, himself appears on stage without a mask. Health officers say their hands are tried. “We are yet to get instructions from the district collector that we can take strict action against politicians who were caught without wearing masks,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/covid-19-cases-jump-by-16-to-130-2-deaths-take-toll-to-688/articleshow/81639248.cms||---

Rane said that Goa government needs to make it mandatory for travellers to produce a Covid-19 certificate before entering the state. “See what is happening in Kerala, Karnataka and Maharashtra,” he said. “We don’t want that to happen in Goa.” He said that since these states make it mandatory for people from Goa to produce a Covid-negative certificate before entering, the Goa government must also demand such certificates. Rane was speaking to reporters after a meeting of the expert committee. “We will come out with a modified SOP and the implementation will start before the next meeting,” he said, adding that committee members have given their suggestion. He said these suggestions would be presented to the government, and that a discussion would be held with CM Pramod Sawant to find a workable solution. Rane said that certain weddings have led to a spike in cases, and emphasised on the need to wear masks and maintain physical distancing. “There have to be restrictions on the number of guests that can be allowed for functions and weddings. I’m of the opinion that the fine for not wearing a mask must be hiked, as is done by the Delhi government,” he said. He said that recently, a prominent wedding party asked its guests to produce a Covid-negative certificate, and this helped create a bubble. Rane also took aim at restaurants that do not maintain Covid norms, adding that the number of people allowed in an eatery must be limited. Stating that the eateries and restaurants have been flouting norms especially in North Goa, he said the number of people that could be allowed in an eatery or a restaurant has to be limited. “I have asked FDA to keep a strict watch on restaurants and eateries, cancel the licenses of those flouting the norms,” he said. “I have also shared my email ID on my Twitter handle, to allow people to share photos and other evidence of restaurants that are violating SOPs.” The health minister also spoke about the government’s plan to expand testing, and take it up to 2,500-2,700 a day. Goa’s current daily average of Covid tests has been 1,400-1,700. Rane said that it has been decided to procure an open-ended testing machine for Hospicio, North Goa district hospital, and Goa Medical College (GMC). With these open-ended testing kits, the cost of testing can be reduced, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rane-moots-covid-ve-cert-for-those-entering-goa/articleshow/81639874.cms||---

He said that the Telangana government is on high alert in the wake of rising corona cases in neighbouring states, especially Maharashtra. “With cases increasing a bit more, we will be in the thick of a second wave. While we are gearing up to tackle the virus, the most important thing to do now is to wear masks. We require support from people, which is primarily wearing masks and vaccination. People should go for it and it will be a protection during the second wave,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director of public health, Telangana. With the number of cases rising at the rate of 50-60 per day, the positivity rate has already doubled up in the last one week. While the positivity rate (which is indicated by the number of persons testing positive out of the people tested) has gone down to 0.45% on March 14, the positivity rate stood at 0.9% on March 22. While on one hand the number of cases have shot up, a further spike in cases is inevitable with people not following Covid precautions, and the police and GHMC not doing enough to enforce the mask rule. To make matters worse, 90% cases are being detected as asymptomatic, which means many people have become super spreaders. Critical cases of Covid-19 are on the rise too. From 39 cases at the beginning of the month, the state-run Gandhi hospital alone has 70 severe cases currently. “At the moment we have 70 critical Covid-19 patients who are either on ventilator or might require ventilator support at any moment. Their oxygen saturation levels are less than 85%. They are either on non-invasive ventilators, C-tap or on high flow oxygen supply,” said Dr M Raja Rao, superintendent, Gandhi hospital. The second wave could be more dangerous for the vulnerable population, officials said. “The vulnerable population, especially the elderly and people with comorbidites, should not delay having the vaccine,” added Dr Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dont-leave-home-unless-must-says-t-as-2nd-virus-wave-looms/articleshow/81640607.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Ugadi cheer for govt staff as Telangana CM announces 30% fitment||HYDERABAD: In what could cheer state government employees, pensioners and teachers, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday announced 30% fitment and also increased retirement age to 61 from existing 58. Claiming that the pandemic had impacted the state’s economy badly and delayed the pay revision last year, the CM said the government had decided to not only revise the pay scales of government employees, but also that of teachers, pensioners and other categories of employees, including contract staff. His statement in the assembly came barely days after the TRS scored an emphatic victory in the graduates MLC constituency elections. The hiked salaries will be applicable from April 1, 2021, and 9,17,797 employees of all categories and pensioners would be benefited. Several government employees’ unions and associations leaders, ministers, legislators met the CM in his chambers in the assembly and thanked him for revising the pay scales. Ugadi (Telugu New Year day), which will be celebrated on April 13, came early for the employees, an association leader said. The Telangana government had last revised the pay scales in 2014 when KCR announced the highest fitment of 43% soon after the formation of the state. In fact, the employees’ long-pending demand has been 43% fitment, but they will now have to settle down for 30%. In the just-concluded MLC polls, various government employees’ unions had openly voiced their support to the TRS following an assurance by the CM of an increased fitment. The Election Commission of India had even slapped a show-cause notice to the employees’ unions leaders for supporting the ruling party in violation of the model code. The CM said contract employees, outsourcing employees, home guards, village revenue assistants, grant-in-aid employees, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan employees, daily wagers, anganwadi workers, Asha workers, Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty (SERP) employees and Telangana Vidya volunteers will be eligible for enhanced salaries. Apart from making announcements on fitment and retirement age, the CM said family members of contributory pension scheme (CPS) employees, who die while on duty, would be brought under family pension policy. He said it has been decided to constitute a steering committee with employees’ associations and government officials as stakeholders for evolving the new modalities of employees’ health scheme (EHS) as per the Pay Revision Commission (PRC) recommendations. He said the government would reduce the age limit from 75 to 70 for availing 15% additional quantum of pension to retired government employees and teachers. Similarly, the retirement gratuity will be increased to Rs 16 lakh from Rs 12 lakh. He said PRC-related 12-month arrears would be paid to the employees along with retirement benefits. Appreciating the government employees, he said they had played an inspirational role during Telangana movement and took part in Sakala Janula Samme (all people’s strike). “Even when the state was united, Telangana gazetted and non-gazetted officers’ association did not change their association’s name. With the same commitment, they are now participating in the development of Telangana. With their cooperation, the fruits of welfare and development are reaching people successfully,” KCR said. The government had constituted a three-member PRC headed by former IAS officer CR Biswal in 2018 to revise pay scales of government employees. The committee recommended 7.5% fitment. Another committee was appointed by the government with chief secretary Somesh Kumar and two principal secretaries — K Ramakrishna Rao (finance) and Rajat Kumar (irrigation) — to hold discussions with the employees’ unions and hear them out. The unions had demanded 43% fitment. In 2018 assembly elections, the ruling TRS had promised in its manifesto to enhance salaries and retirement age. Since then, PRC and salary hike had become a major campaign issue in every election. Rumour mills were active during Dubbak and GHMC elections that the TRS had lost primarily due to government employees not voting for the party as they were angry with the government over delay in announcing revision of their pay scales.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ugadi-cheer-for-govt-staff-as-cm-announces-30-fitment/articleshow/81640608.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC tells CR to pay Rs 8 lakh to dad of man who fell from train and died||MUMBAI: Bombay high court has directed Central Railway to pay Rs 8 lakh compensation to the fath er of a man who died after falling from a Mumbai local. It quashed and aside the Railway Claims Tribunal’s verdict that held that the death was due crossing the tracks. Justice Prithviraj Chavan allowed the appeal against its Mumbai bench’s January 31, 2018, order by Trombay resident Sadashiv Kotiyan. His son Jagdish (27), a labourer, was traveling from Mankhurd to Sewri. Before the train reached Govandi station, he accidentally fell off and was cut into two at the waist. But the tribunal held that his presence on CR premises was unauthorised and consequently he was knocked down. Also, the said act is an offence of trespass and not an “untoward incident” under the Railways Act, 1989. Justice Chavan noted that while the tribunal held that he was a bona fide passenger as his ticket was recovered, it also held that it was not an “untoward incident’’ by relying on the motorman’s evidence, inquest panchnama and papers prepared by railway personnel. It observed that the genuineness and veracity of those papers cannot be doubted. Justice Chavan said the tribunal’s observations were not only improper and incorrect but also perverse and were required to be set aside. “Rather, the so-called opinion of the police and panchas of inquest panchnama does not indicate that they had, in fact, seen the deceased crossing the tracks and hit by the local train, resulting in cutting his body into two. This is something ridiculous,’’said Justice Chavan in his March 15 judgment. He agreed with Kotiyan’s advocate Vasant More that there was no expert evidence as to under what circumstances a person’s body would get cut into two and when it would not. The judge said the tribunal “should not have rendered its personal opinion” while adjudicating the claim. “...once having held that he was a bona fide passenger, there was no need for the tribunal to construe that while crossing the railway tracks he met with an accident, which was, per se, a criminal act.. The respondent (CR) failed to discharge its onus in that regard,’’ Justice Chavan concluded. He imposed Rs3,000 costs. If Rs 8 lakh is not paid within six weeks, it will carry future interest of 9% pa. The deceased, Jagdish (27), a labourer, was travelling from Mankhurd to Sewri.

Covid management is still dependent on resident doctors in both government medical colleges (GMCs) in the city. Despite clear warnings about second surge likely in February–March, the government, especially the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), failed to develop its own medical facilities during the last one year and appoint full-time doctors in the already insufficient number of hospitals to handle the pandemic properly, say the residents. “Even after a year since the first case of Covid infection was detected in the city, the civic body is still dependent on Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) for Covid-19 treatment. The NMC neither has full-time doctors, nor good hospitals. Now, once again, we are loaded with the Covid work, which is affecting academics,” said a senior resident from GMCH. While the budding doctors’ concerns are genuine, they are not willing to be named fearing possible action under the Epidemic Diseases Act. Doctors told TOI that residents of anaesthesia, surgery, medicine are overloaded with Covid work. Last year, during first wave of Covid-19, these medicos volunteered for the work realizing their responsibilities. But, now once again, the residents are staring at academic loss. “Curriculum will be affected, life will be hit, we will lag behind others,” said a doctor. “We have to work on non-Covid patients too. Elective surgeries must happen because the experience is must for us. Thesis is important for final year students. Neither we demand, nor we get relaxation in online examination,” said a resident from IGGMCH. The residents also lamented the fact that non-medical students got online exam and other relaxations while the real Covid warriors don’t get any such facilities. The concern of residents in Nagpur GMCs are more serious because they are lagging behind students in Mumbai GMCH. “In Mumbai, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) itself runs medical colleges. The civic body gives additional payments for the Covid work to the residents. We have to look to the state Directorate of Medical Education and Research for that,” said a doctor. Future In Jeopardy GMCH and IGGMCH residents are deployed in Covid service This will be the second consecutive academic year they will suffer Residents are losing their own subject related practical, lessons, thesis work etc Medical exams are held offline only and students don’t get any relaxation like other graduates As non-Covid surgeries are reduced, residents are not getting enough experience||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/resident-docs-on-covid-duty-staring-at-academic-losses/articleshow/81637300.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Jaipur||Former sarpanch transforms life; PM Modi praises his water conservation efforts||Jaipur: Former sarpanch of Shakargarh (Bhilwara) Kishore Kumar Sharma (55) shared his journey of transforming a water deficit gram panchayat to a self-sustainable water model from between 2010 and 2020 with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a virual programme to mark World Water Day on Monday. The life-changing experience for villagers, who were suffering due to fluoride-laced drinking water for decades, started after Sharma attended a session on water conservation by an NGO in 2004.“Since my childhood, I had seen health hazards of drinking fluoride-laced water in every household, our women fetching water from wells as deep as 250 feet, chronic droughts and migration of our menfolk since farmlands produced only one crop per year,” said Sharma. He took up the challenge of transforming villagers’ lives after he became a gram panchayat member.The actual change began after he was elected sarpanch in 2010. “Today my village has 40 anicuts developed at strategic places to accumulate rainwater, digging of existing ponds and wells and 1,200 bighas of forest. The efforts have recharged the groundwater table to an extent that it is now available at 100 feet against 250 feet a decade ago. Also, the fluoride content has diminished and water is safe to drink,” said Sharma.The change doesn’t restrict to drinking water alone. The excess of water has improved the socio-economic status of the villagers. “The village now boasts of growing two crops in a year and that too wheat which has raised the income level. Our next plan is to grow oranges in the village. If this comes true, it will make us prosperous forever,” said Sharma.The village has a total population of 6,123. Since fetching water has become easy the women in the village have started engaging in economic activities. Sharma has helped to create 72 self-help groups (SHGs) that engage 500 women. “Our SHGs have received loans of Rs 2.8 crore. It is making women self-reliant,” said Sharma. The fodder grown in 1,200 bighas and 45 shops made on the village land fetching the gram panchayat Rs 2.5 lakh monthly making it a self-sustainable model in the region.His tireless work has been recognised by the state and central government several times. In 2007, the then president Dr APJ Abdul Kalam gave him the Nirmal Gram Award, while the state conferred on him the Adarsh Gram Yojana Award in 2008.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/former-sarpanch-transforms-life-pm-modi-praises-his-water-conservation-efforts/articleshow/81639255.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||Coimbatore||To prevent stirs, TWAD board to ensure city gets enough water till Apr 6||Coimbatore: In a move to keep the residents happy ahead of the polls and prevent them from taking to streets demanding adequate drinking water supply, the Tamil Nadu Water and Drainage (TWAD) board has increased the quantity water being drawn from Siruvani reservoir for supplying it to the city corporation areas and a few villages. On Monday, 99.41 million litres water was drawn from the reservoir. An official source said, “The TWAD had only been drawing about 75-80 million litres per day (MLD) from the reservoir till February-end. From March 1, it started to gradually increase the quantity of water being drawn from the reservoir. From March 14, the quantity was increased to 99MLD. It is to ensure drinking water is supplied in abundance so that residents don’t take out protests or plan to boycott poll, citing water scarcity.” The water level in the Siruvani reservoir was recorded at 27.50ft on the day against the full capacity of 49.5ft. “If the TWAD continues to draw around 99MLD water for long, the city might face severe water shortage before the next monsoon. Hence, a decision was taken to draw this much water only till April 6, when the state will go to poll. The supply will be reduced to 75-80 MLD from the very next day. It is to avoid water shortage and ensure supply till May-end,” the official said. He said at the current water level in the reservoir, they could supply water till June 15. With the water from Pillur and Aliyar reservoirs, the city corporation has been supplying drinking water in its limits once in six days on an average. However, bore well water is being supplied almost daily in old corporation areas and once in three to four days in newly-added areas. The drinking water requirement of the city is 210-220MLD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/to-prevent-stirs-twad-board-to-ensure-city-gets-enough-water-till-apr-6/articleshow/81639256.cms||Nivedha Selvam
---||Goa||Monserrate stamps his mark on CCP with 25 seats||PANAJI: The BJP-backed panel swept elections to the Corporation of the City of Panaji on Monday, allowing Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate to tighten his grip on the state capital. Of the 30 seats that were up for grabs, the BJP-backed panel won 25, overcoming rebellion from within the party’s ranks and a late challenge from ‘We Ponjekar’ that comprised a motley group of Congress, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and civic activists. The panel came a distant second with just four seats to its credit. BJP’s victory, while reassuring for the party in Goa, will make some of its workers squirm with what is a clear indication that Monserrate has dismantled the influence of BJP’s old guard and has stamped his authority over the state capital. A perfect illustration of this is the victory of Monserrate’s son, Rohit, from ward number 3, which has undermined BJP’s stance on ‘family raj’. The debutant’s rise comes at a time when the political capital of former Panaji MLA Sidharth Kuncalienker and former BJP spokesperson Dattaprasad Naik appears to be on the decline. Kuncalienker and Naik had openly worked against the panel floated by Monserrate. BJP has even censured the two for rebelling against Monserrate in the run-up to the CCP elections, which were held on March 20. However, BJP’s gamble to anger its karyakartas and appease Monserrate has paid off spectacularly. Given a free hand by the party, Monserrate chose to shunt out several long-term BJP karyakartas and bring in his own supporters. As political watchers pointed out, though the panel has been officially backed by BJP, most of the elected corporators swear allegiance to Monserrate and not to the party itself. The CCP has been a tough nut for BJP to crack. The saffron party has found it extremely difficult to hold sway over it — even when former chief minister Manohar Parrikar was the local MLA — as it just could not wrest control of the body away from Monserrate who was either Taleigao MLA or St Cruz MLA. Monserrate, who has a history of party-hopping, won the 2019 bypolls on a Congress ticket and within a month, joined BJP along with nine other Congress legislators. “This is the first election where I have gone on a BJP panel. Earlier it was always my panel. But still, we maintain victory,” said Monserrate. In the 2016 CCP polls, his panel had won just 17 seats, including the wards represented by Surendra and Ruth Furtado. This time around, however, he won 25 seats. “It is not easy to win 25 out of 30 seats and this is despite all the other parties coming together to defeat BJP. On top of this, our own people worked against us,” said state BJP president Sadanand Tanavade while reacting to the election’s results. Tanavade said that the polls were a test to see if the people still backed Monserrate after his switch from Congress to BJP. “We have been given the job and it is my responsibility to complete it. Earlier, I used to float my own panel but I am happy that the party gave me a free hand to campaign,” said Monserrate. While his son Rohit succeeded in cornering 70% of the votes in his ward, it will not be lost on political watchers that Rohit’s mother, Jennifer, is a minister in the Pramod Sawant government. Outgoing CCP mayor Uday Madkaikar also succeeded in holding on to his seat and won the elections with a comfortable margin of 400 votes. The We Ponjekar panel won in the remaining five wards. Surendra Furtado, a four-term mayor and his wife Ruth managed to get re-elected. Perhaps the biggest upset was felt by outgoing corporator Rahul Lotlikar, who lost to a young underdog, Joel Andrade, in ward number 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/monserrate-stamps-his-mark-on-ccp-with-25-seats/articleshow/81639885.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Coimbatore||Work together to streamline dist’s overall growth, activists urge political parties||Coimbatore: Activists have presented a list of demands before the political parties to streamline the district’s overall growth and requested them to consider them if voted to power. R Raveendran, secretary, Residents Awareness Association of Coimbatore, said, “The winning party should come out with a master plan for Coimbatore and form a nodal planning agency on the lines of Chennai metropolitan development authority. It will help us envision long-term plans and streamline growth.” Explaining the importance of the Noyyal river, he said a separate division should be formed within the public works department to rejuvenate and restore the river after conducting a detailed study. “Steps should also be taken to prevent sewage from entering the river.” Raveendran said it was high time the airport expansion project was implemented and introduced more international flights from the district. “This will help bring more software companies to the district and create more job opportunities.” K Kathirmathiyon, secretary, Coimbatore Consumer Cause, called for projects to reduce traffic congestion in the city. “Steps should be taken to expand the expressway on Avinashi Road for another 2.5km from Chinniyampalayam to Neelambur. Another expressway should be constructed on Sathyamangalam Road in the city to reduce traffic congestion. We also need a central government institution.” Pointing out that one has to travel all the way to Chennai to file a case before the high court, he said there was a need to set up a bench of the Madras high court in Coimbatore. “All the MLAs elected from the district need to raise their voice together to fulfil these demands. So, instead of releasing separate manifestoes for each segment, parties should release a single manifesto for the entire district, so that people could be benefited at large,” Kathirmathiyon said. Another activist, SP Thiyagarajan, said basic amenities, including roads, drinking water and sanitation facilities, should be improved in the district. “All the scheme roads that were proposed for the past two decades should be implemented immediately and steps should be taken to complete the underground drainage project at the earliest.” He also sought transparency in government works, a proper grievance redressal system and a single-window system to obtain certificates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/work-together-to-streamline-dists-overall-growth-activists-urge-political-parties/articleshow/81639260.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The smaller parties may not appear to have a major impact in the polls, but can play a spoilsport for the BJP and Congress in case of a close contest. BTP MLA Rajkumar Roat said that they have finalised their candidate for Rajsamand, while they are holding deliberations on the other two seats. “I have been telling that both the Congress and the BJP will give tickets to the privileged kith and kin of the deceased MLAs. Our party will give tickets to fresh faces who doesn’t come from a dynasty,” said Roat. BJP’s Kiran Maheshwari won by a thumping margin of 30,000 votes in 2018 assembly polls. BTP was in alliance with the Congress and parted ways in November following differences with the latter. The party is hoping to make gains in its tribal votes which are insignificant, but can decide the victory or defeat of any candidate. Drifted away from the NDA alliance over its opposition to the farm laws, Hanuman Beniwal’s RLP has appointed elected coordinators on Monday. The party has deputed its Bhopalgarh MLA Pukhraj Garg as incharge of Rajsamand, Khinvsar MLA of Sahara and Merta MLA Indira Devi of Sujangarh. “The party will bet on the local leaders and is the only option for voters who don’t like to fall into the trap of BJP and the Congress,” said Ravindra Singh, national treasurer, RLP. Singh added that their party stands with the farmers. “The farmers’ issue has not subsided and it will turn the tables around for the party,” Singh said. Upbeat over the victory of some seats in local body polls, the SDPI is likely to contest from the Sahara seat in Bhilwara. The nominations will begin from March 23 and elections will take place on April 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/smaller-parties-to-contest-bypolls/articleshow/81645762.cms||---

For students of classes IX to XII, the exams in April will be held offline, with limited seating of 12-14 students per class. The final exams for all these classes will end before April 24, to facilitate the conduct of the Class XII public (board) exam, followed by the Class X board exam. For the conduct of the online exams, schools will send question papers to students either on the school app or any messaging app. “We are sending the question paper through the school app, and for those who are unable to access the paper, we will send the paper on Whatsapp as backup,” said headmaster of Dr KB Hedgewar High School, Cujira, Vilas Satarkar. “At the end of the exam time, students have to send in their answersheet in PDF format to their teacher.” “Once the exam is over, their parents have to drop off the hard copies of the answersheets to the school, in a box provided for the purpose in the premises.” Last year, the final exams for students upto Class VIII were cancelled due to the pandemic, and students were assessed based on their performance in previous tests held during the academic year. Also for the first time, students of lower classes will answer their final exams for a curtailed syllabus (by up to 30%) depending on the class. The syllabus up to Class VIII has been curtailed by the directorate of education, and the syllabus from Class IX to XII was curtailed by the Goa board of secondary and higher secondary education. For the convenience of schools, no fixed exam schedule has been provided other than the instructions that the final exams up to Class VIII and for Class IX and XI should end by April 24. Therefore, each school will have a different question paper and a different schedule as per the institute and its students’ convenience. For the Class IX and XI exams, students, besides limiting their numbers per class, will be seated by skipping a few benches in between to be able to maintain social distancing, schools said. “Students are not being given any extra time for the online exam,”said a teacher from a South Goa school. “They will get the usual amount of time. For instance, two-and-a-half hours for an 80-mark question paper. Students up to Class VIII are being warned that the PDF file they submit after the exam will be compared with the actual answersheet they submit in schools, to discourage cheating. But there is no way for schools to monitor if students are writing the exam with an open book or if their parents are assisting them during the exam.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-a-1st-students-up-to-class-viii-to-answer-finals-online/articleshow/81639890.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Jaipur||Smaller parties to contest bypolls in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: The smaller parties — Bhartiya Tribal Party (BTP), Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) and Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) — are all set to make the bypolls in Sahara, Rajsamand and Sujangarh interesting by fielding their candidates. The smaller parties may not appear to have a major impact in the polls, but can play a spoilsport for the BJP and Congress in case of a close contest. BTP MLA Rajkumar Roat said that they have finalised their candidate for Rajsamand, while they are holding deliberations on the other two seats. “I have been telling that both the Congress and the BJP will give tickets to the privileged kith and kin of the deceased MLAs. Our party will give tickets to fresh faces who doesn’t come from a dynasty,” said Roat. BJP’s Kiran Maheshwari won by a thumping margin of 30,000 votes in 2018 assembly polls. BTP was in alliance with the Congress and parted ways in November following differences with the latter. The party is hoping to make gains in its tribal votes which are insignificant, but can decide the victory or defeat of any candidate. Drifted away from the NDA alliance over its opposition to the farm laws, Hanuman Beniwal’s RLP has appointed elected coordinators on Monday. The party has deputed its Bhopalgarh MLA Pukhraj Garg as incharge of Rajsamand, Khinvsar MLA of Sahara and Merta MLA Indira Devi of Sujangarh. “The party will bet on the local leaders and is the only option for voters who don’t like to fall into the trap of BJP and the Congress,” said Ravindra Singh, national treasurer, RLP. Singh added that their party stands with the farmers. “The farmers’ issue has not subsided and it will turn the tables around for the party,” Singh said. Upbeat over the victory of some seats in local body polls, the SDPI is likely to contest from the Sahara seat in Bhilwara. The nominations will begin from March 23 and elections will take place on April 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/smaller-parties-to-contest-bypolls/articleshow/81639258.cms||---

The trip has been delayed due to travel restrictions by the Madhya Pradesh government. Khan now waits for the curbs to be eased. In a bid to prevent a Nagpur-like situation, the MP government has imposed curbs on travel from Maharashtra. Last week, entry of buses from Nagpur was stopped. Those entering the state from Maharashtra have to produce a Covid negative certificate or else remain under seven-day home quarantine. Curbs have affected access to healthcare for a large number of patients across the state border in Madhya Pradesh. Apart from the new ones, even review of old cases has been held up, say sources. A sizeable population from neighbouring districts of MP and remote areas come to Nagpur for medical help. The numbers have dwindled gradually after restrictions were imposed. Patients from MP are also scared about rising Covid cases in Nagpur, said sources TOI talked to. A senior health department official in MP said, “The authorities are also discouraging travel for medical reasons unless it is not a dire emergency. We are insisting that people should avoid travel only for medical consultation. Of course they can go if there is an emergency. On their return, travellers have to get a Covid negative certificate,” the official said. Dr Shrikant Mukkewar of Midas Multispecialty Clinic said there has been a significant decline in the number of patients from MP. “This is affecting treatment too. For example, patients of liver diseases need to be reviewed in 10 days. Travel curbs have affected their visits,” he said. Dr Sanjeev Chaudhary, an orthopedic surgeon, said it can be managed where only consultation is needed, but cases where physical examination is needed have been certainly affected. Representatives of other major hospitals, including corporate set ups, also reported a drop in patients from MP. Over the years, a daily train that connects Jabalpur and Nagpur has earned the name ‘Ambulance’. Patients form neighbouring states find the overnight train the most convenient means to reach the doctor in Nagpur and return the same day. On Sunday night, not more than 30% of the capacity was returning. From March 1 to 15, over 800 passengers travelled by the train each day as against a capacity of 1300. Figures of next week are yet to be compiled. “As much as half of the patients in buses taking off from Damoh to Nagpur used to be patients. Now, bus services itself have been stopped,” said Dr Surendra Patel in Damoh. “Over the years, medial facilities have developed in MP too. A number of patients prefer to get treated here itself. Yet there are many who still prefer doctors in Nagpur whom they have been regularly visiting,” a government source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mp-govts-travel-curbs-hits-patient-flow-to-city/articleshow/81637307.cms||Shishir Arya

The shortlisted names would be presented before the Congress Election Committee (CEC), which needs to take a final call on the candidates to be fielded. Congress would be defending Sujangarh and Sahara seats, while BJP would be fighting to retain the Rajsamand seat.Maken held discussions with chief minister Ashok Gehlot and PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra about the probable candidates and the party’s bypoll strategy at the chief minister’s residence during the day. Later, he held discussions with ministers and the PCC executive at the party headquarters.“I have asked for panel names of the shortlisted candidates by Tuesday, so that the CEC and the Congress president can discuss and take decisions,” Maken told reporters here. He added that a control room has been set up at the PCC especially for the bypolls. Maken evaded questions on state-level political appointments and expansion of organisational setup in the state. “We will talk about these after the bypolls,” he said.Party sources said the shortlisted names include late MLA Bhanwar Lal Meghwal’s son Manoj Meghwal for the Sujangarh assembly seat, late MLA Kailash Trivedi’s wife Gayatri and brother Rajendra for the Sahara assembly seat and Tansukh Bohra, Mahesh Pratap Singh and Asha Paliwal for the Rajsamand assembly seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/maken-rubbishes-phone-tapping-charges-discusses-bypolls/articleshow/81639259.cms||---

The accused has demanded a ransom of Rs 1 lakh for the girl's release. In a complaint lodged to the SP on March 20, Mohammad Salim, a labourer at a brick kiln in Sukatia village under Amaria police station in Pilibhit, stated that he and other members of his family were employed at a brick kiln in Madhubani district of Bihar one and a half years ago. “My first daughter-in-law Jaibun Nisha, who hailed from Chhapra city in Bihar, had died after giving birth to a daughter five years ago. A few months ago, a Madhubani resident proposed the matrimonial alliance of his niece Soni with my widower son Mohammad Yusuf. After their wedding, they shifted from Bihar to Pilibhit,” said the complainant. “On February 18, my daughter-in-law’s uncle visited Pilibhit and stayed at my home for a few days. One night, he disappeared with Soni and my granddaughter Hina. We kept searching for him in Bihar, but in vain. Five days ago, I received a call from Soni’s uncle, demanding Rs 1 lakh ransom to release Hina.

---||Goa||Kaajro, a rare look at untouchability in Goa, wins nat’l film award||PANAJI: A Konkani film with just two shots — one of which runs for 100 minutes, almost the entire length of the movie — was on Monday declared a winner at the 67th national film awards. ‘Kaajro’ is the first film ever to portray the practice of untouchability in parts of rural Goa, and the lives and customs of the community. The film is based on a story by acclaimed Konkani writer Prakash Parienkar. “The film revolves around Tilgya, who is refused land to bury the body of his wife, who was ailing,” he told TOI. “He has to cross the village limits to bury her. The film portrays the rituals of this community, which very few are familiar with, like burying the dead in a sitting position.” He said that no one had written about the life of this community in Goa before, not even people from within the community. “I am happy that my story could bring their lives to a mainstream platform, and push it into dialogue at the national level,” he said after it won best regional film (Konkani). Filmed in the rural and forested areas of Valpoi, it also brings these areas of Goa into the mainstream for the very first time. ‘Kaajro’ was initially planned as a one-shot film, but “it is a one-cut film because the cameraman’s batteries drained out,” said Parienkar, an associate professor of Konkani at Goa University. “For one hour and forty minutes, the crew carried the camera and equipment, following the protagonist into the forest, crossing a river.” ‘Kaajro’ is directed by Pune-based Nitin Bhaskar, who has earlier worked with the likes of Shyam Benegal, and produced by Goan actor-producer Rajesh Pednekar. It stars Vithal Kaale (as Tilgya) and debutante Jyoti Bagkar (as his wife Gokula) in the lead roles. Monday’s award isn’t Kaajro’s first accolate. It has already received recognition nationally, having been screened at nearly all of the country’s top film festivals, including International Film Festival of India (Iffi) and the Mumbai International Film Festival.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kaajro-a-rare-look-at-untouchability-in-goa-wins-natl-film-award/articleshow/81639915.cms||---

He said that there was a continuous spike in fuel prices on a daily basis before the announcement of Assembly polls which has abruptly stopped following election announcement.In a tweet in Hindi, Gehlot said, “Before elections were announced in four states on February 26, prices of diesel and petrol were increasing daily. In 15 days, petrol and diesel became expensive by about Rs 5. Then the Modi government had spoken about crude oil being expensive and the government having no control over it. But the situation changed after the elections were announced.”“After elections were announced, from February 28 till March 21, the fuel prices of diesel and petrol have not increased by a penny, while the prices of crude oil have increased by about USD 8 per barrel in the international market. The country has now understood these tricks of the central government very well,” Gehlot said in another tweet.Earlier, Union petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan had said the increase in international crude prices had led to rise in fuel prices in India and noted that ‘temporary’ rise will come down gradually.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-targets-centre-links-fuel-price-stability-to-assembly-polls/articleshow/81639269.cms||---

Pandey’s main contention is that the appointment is an ‘arbitrary exercise’ to promote some officers. In December, former DGP Subodh Jaiswal had opted for the central deputation due to his differences with the state authority and was appointed chief of the Central Industrial Security Force. Hemant Nagrale, the second most senior IPS officer in the state after Pandey, was then given additional charge of DGP. But after the Sachin Waze controversy, the state shifted Nagrale as Mumbai police commissioner in place of Param Bir Singh and appointed Rajneesh Seth as acting DGP.

In a March 15 judgment made available on Monday, Justice Gautam Patel of the HC noted that “a very real human tragedy is unfolding... and is tearing apart the social fabric of this city”. The HC directed the builder in the case to give possession of land, property and papers to the society to enable it to undertake the project or appoint a new developer. Times ViewThis order is striking because it seeks to dispense justice to those forcibly displaced from dilapidated buildings but have nowhere to go if the rents legitimately due to them are stopped. Displacement is an issue which has seldom been understood by those who matter. The judgment voices the woes of the stranded families and recognises the predatory nature of the redevelopment process. There is a crying need to overhaul redevelopment schemes and make them resident-friendly.In 2012, the Rajawadi Arunodaya Co-operative Housing Society in Ghatkopar opted to have their pre-1985 building with 20 residential flats and several shops redeveloped after constant repairs. In 2015, the residents vacated their premises and were promised new permanent homes latest by October 2017. However, last year, due to non-completion of the project, they moved court seeking removal of Value Projects Pvt Ltd, their builder since 2013. The HC appointed a court receiver to take symbolic possession of the land until project completion and also directed the civic body to grant necessary nods. “It is all very easy to say in a court of law that ‘arrears of transit rent’ have not been paid. What does this actually mean? Digits and commas on a page in a lawsuit do not let us comprehend the terrifying reality of what that non-payment of rent month after month after month must mean to ordinary, middle-income people. For one thing, it means they have to find their own way to pay the rent in transit. Delays in redevelopment cannot be accepted merely because of contractual obligations,” the HC noted. The Real Estate (regulation and development) Act came into effect in May 2017. The builder had in August 2017 set a new deadline of June 2019. But by September 2019, the proposed 13 storied new building was far from complete. The society then decided to end their deal and in December 2019 issued a formal notice of termination of its contract with the builder. Last September, the developer too filed a cross-petition before the HC, seeking a pre-termination status quo of its development agreement and directions not to be ejected from the project. However, the HC dismissed the developer’s plea for interim relief pending arbitration. The HC noted that interim relief before commencement of arbitration involves an “equitable (just and fair) remedy. “After all, in such cases, we are not dealing with any arms’ length market transaction of simply putting up a building on an empty plot of land,” the court stated, and appointed advocate Karl Shroff as a sole arbitrator in the dispute between the Ghatkopar society and the developer under the April 2013 agreement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/transit-rents-not-a-sop-bldr-not-paying-it-is-injustice-hc/articleshow/81640611.cms||Swati Deshpande

The Election Commission of India has assigned him coconut farm as his symbol. While Khan had already started campaigning at Ukkadam fish market, Perur, RS Puram and a few other places in the city, he had released an audio on Sunday evening stating he was planning to withdraw the candidature, as there were rumours that he had received huge amount from political parties to split the minority votes. The audio had gone viral on social media. However, Khan did not withdraw his nomination. “I was hurt deeply after lot of people asked me if I had received money from other political parties to split the minority votes. So, I planned to withdraw my candidature. When I spoke to my family members, my daughter told me not to withdraw the nomination,” the actor said. While Khan had sought permission to use four vehicles for campaign, he is yet to hear from officials. He also couldn’t get a house on rent, despite searching for one at Thondamuthur, Karumbukadai, Vadavalli and Gandhipark areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/im-in-the-fray-says-mansoor-ali-khan/articleshow/81639274.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolhapur||Gokul poll: Mushrif joins Satej Patil-Mandlik team||Kolhapur: In a major blow to the ruling front in the Gokul dairy (Kolhapur Jilha Sahakari Dudh Utpadak Sangh), NCP leader and minister Hasan Mushrif has joined the opposition front under the new banner of Rajarshi Shahu Shetkari Aghadi. The election to the dairy, which has an annual turnover more than Rs 3,500 crore, is expected to be announced anytime soon. Political parties do not directly contest the election of this cooperative dairy, but party functionaries form fronts and constitute a panel of candidates to be elected as directors of the dairy. One of the directors is then elected as the dairy’s chairman. The control of the dairy gives direct access to the farmers. Those who can gain favour of the dairy farmers by offering high milk prices can seek votes for the assembly and general elections. Currently, Congress functionary and MLA P N Patil and Tararani Aghadi’s Mahadevrao Mahadik have hold over the dairy. Mushrif was earlier with the Patil-Mahadik alliance. However, this time he has decided support the panel led by district guardian minister Satej Patil and Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Mandlik. Mushrif said: “Many in Sena and Congress had requested me to fight with them in the Gokul dairy election as we have an alliance at the state level. Also, the ruling alliance, which is supported by the BJP, has started trying to destabilise the state government in some way or other. The farmers too are fed up and they voted for us in the recent elections. They expect us to work together for them in Gokul dairy as well.” Meanwhile, two directors of the ruling alliance — Arun Dongale and Jayashri Patil — joined the Rajarshi Shahu Shetkari Aghadi delivering another blow to the Patil-Mahadik alliance. Dongale said the plan to extend the dairy’s operations to multiple states has been opposed by the farmers and he (Dongale) was the first to oppose the plan in the director body’s meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/gokul-poll-mushrif-joins-satej-patil-mandlik-team/articleshow/81639279.cms||---

The men, who call themselves members of the Pagal gang, had also shot a man in Civil Lines recently when he fought back during a robbery. Of the arrested, Sahil, 24, was previously involved in 37 cases of robbery, snatching and vehicle thefts, and Fazal, 21, in 20 cases of robbery, snatching and thefts. The past criminal record of Aakash Bhalla, 22, is being ascertained. A pistol loaded with three cartridges and five high-end stolen motorcycles were recovered from their possession. On March 12, when a driver’s employer and his 11-year-old son rushed to his help when accosted by robbers, the criminals had opened fire, hitting the minor on his shoulder. According to Anto Alphonse, DCP (North), Saurabh Sharma of Pitampura had complained the same morning of being attacked and robbed by two armed men on motorcycles while awaiting a bus to Jaipur near Majnu Ka Tilla. “Sharma fought back and caught one of the robbers, but the other man opened fire and hit him on his leg,” said Alphonse. “The duo fled, but left behind one of the motorcycles, a TVS Apache.” The bike was discovered to be stolen from Jahangirpuri just hours before the early morning attack on Sharma. “After scanning CCTV footage and through local enquiries, our team zeroed in on Aakash Bhalla. He was caught along with a juvenile, from whom a loaded pistol was recovered. After questioning them, three stolen motorcycles were also recovered,” the DCP said. The arrested man and the minor told police they were members of the Pagal gang. On information acquired through questioning, police apprehended Sahil and Fazal who came to meet the fence Azeem, who is absconding. A stolen motorcycle was recovered from the duo. With their arrest, police claimed to have solved 12 cases of attempt to murder, robbery, snatching and violations of the Arms Act registered in areas like Shalimar Bagh, Jaffrabad, Usmanpur, Palam and Sagarpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/minor-among-4-held-for-shooting-at-an-11-year-old-for-resisting-snatching-bid/articleshow/81639972.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Overconfidence of coalitions in Kerala||On the eve of the elections in Kerala, one feature that characterizes all political leaders is overconfidence. It is common practice for politicians down the ages to express optimism about victory even when they know that they are down in the doldrums. But here, the overconfidence makes them say and do things without being aware of the dangers lurking around them. Kerala has a healthy tradition of bringing the two coalitions to power by turns so that each can spend half their term to undo what its predecessor had done and the other half to make their own mistakes. This disproves the theory that Kerala is a politically polarized state. There is obviously a swing group which remembers the evils of the previous government and votes for a change in the fond hope that the other side may deliver better. Consequently, the progress of the state is stalled. This time, the incumbent LDF government is confident that it will continue despite a battalion of scandals, corruption charges, allegations of anti-national activities in collusion with a foreign country and mishandling of sensitive issues, which should normally have brought the government down even before it completed its term. The campaign slogan of the coalition is that “return is certain.” Besides, the latest opinion polls by different agencies and TV channels indicate that continuity is possible. The main opposition coalition, UDF, of which Congress is the leading partner is no less confident, as it believes that it is the only viable alternative for Kerala, even though not a day passes without defiance of the state and central leaderships on the selection of candidates. The release of the list of candidates in the name of the ‘High Command’ culminated in a tonsure by a spirited lady leader. The coalition is expecting to return to power on the strength of the number of cases raised by it to discredit the ruling coalition. Muslim League, a component of UDF, has quietly planned things in advance, expanded the number of seats and announced its candidates. Normally, announcements by the supreme head of the party is never challenged by the party, but this time the candidate selection was questioned by some. The overconfidence of NDA is a true mystery as a wave in its favour is not in evidence. Metroman E Sreedharan has much to be confident about and he naturally expresses it in modest terms. One swallow does not make a summer. Hope the Metroman, with his outstanding credentials, will be in the Rashtrapati Bhavan a la Dr APJ Abdul Kalam one day. The confidence of parties has engendered a phenomenon this time, which can be characterized as “localitis”. The political parties have always been suspicious of “imported” candidates as they have their own hierarchy based on working at the grass roots levels. This time the “localitis” became so acute that some good people became victims of this prejudice. The tragic flaw of overconfidence makes any prediction difficult and pollsters are waiting for the completion of the flow of “prominent” people from one coalition to another even at the last minute, believing that even a week is a long time in politics. The only prediction that can be made at this time is that there will be many surprises when the voting machines deliver the results.

Enrolment statistics from the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education show that 13.1 lakh students have registered online for the exam. Last year, the numbers stood at 14.2 lakh. The drop is in all the nine divisions of the state board contributing to an overall fall in the registration for the examination. The state board conducts the examination in nine divisions of Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Nashik, Amravati, Latur, Kolhapur and Konkan. Experts, attributing the reduced enrolment to the Covid-19 situation, said many students may have opted for a gap year with schools and colleges barely opening and coaching classes remaining shut for a long period, affecting exam preparations. The new academic year began with classes going online, but in November, some parts of Maharashtra started offline classes for board students which were abandoned again when the Covid-19 cases increased in March. The state board said the drop in enrolment could be a domino effect of the poor pass percentage (77.10) in the secondary school certificate exam (SSC, Std X) in 2019.  In 2019, the results of the SSC exam were poor There was a drop in the pass percentage that year which has had repercussions this year. Two years on, those students are in HSC and hence there is a drop in enrolment||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hsc-exam-enrolment-drops-by-1-lakh-this-yr-in-mumbai/articleshow/81640004.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The accident took place in Pasiyapura area under Civil Lines police station around 7 am when the Bolero reportedly coming from the wrong direction rammed into the pickup van with 15 people — all vegetable vendors at a Ghaziabad mandi — on board. The victims were on their way home in Shahjahanpur for Holi, said police, who rescued the injured passengers trapped inside the vehicle and sent them to the district hospital in Rampur. Three of a family — Rahul (24), his mother Meena Devi (50) and his niece Gungun (14 months) — were proclaimed dead by doctors upon arrival, while Rahul’s sister and Gungun’s mother Poonam (28) and one Ashish (15) succumbed to their injuries during the treatment at the hospital. Of the 10 injured, the condition of three — including Bolero driver Waseem, a resident of Amroha district — was critical and they were shifted to a higher medical facility in Moradabad, said police. Pickup van driver Jagdish, a resident of Ghaziabad, said he was carrying 15 people on their way home to Shahjahanpur for Holi. Five of them died while others were seriously injured, he added. Superintendent of police Shogun Gautam said, “The bodies were sent for the postmortem and their kin were informed about the tragedy.” Following the complaint of Poonam’s husband Dhanpal, a resident of Shahjahanpur, Jagdish was booked under sections 304 A (causing death by negligence), 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code, said Civil Lines SHO Durga Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/4-of-family-among-5-killed-10-others-injured-as-speeding-suv-crashes-into-pickup-van-on-nh-24/articleshow/81638313.cms||Nazar Abbas

The bench of Justice Anil Kumar Upadhyay passed the order while hearing a batch of writ petitions filed by at least 18 candidates, including Ravi Kumar and Amit Shanker. The petitioners had moved the court after having been barred by the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) on the direction of education department, from taking part in the selection process. The court also rapped the state government and the BPSC for their slack behaviour in the entire matter. It also directed BPSC to start fresh recruitment process. Counsels Sunil Kumar Singh and Jogendra Kumar appeared for the petitioners in the case. The petitioners were holding MEd degree in special education from recognized universities and were also NET qualified. They had applied for the post of lecturers/assistant professors against advertisement for the vacancies of altogether 478 posts published by the BPSC in 2016. An MEd degree was the initial basic qualification. However, even after being found eligible in provisional selection list, education department’s principal secretary issued a letter on June 8, 2018 that MEd in special education, special visual impairment or mental retardation would not be on par with MEd degree. Counsel Singh said the education department had sought opinion from a Patna University expert, who said they were not eligible for the selection process against the posts. “Based on the opinion, the then secretary issued a letter barring these candidates from taking part in the selection process,” he said. Singh said they had appeared in the written examination on the interim order of the high court and later also in interview. “But, at the end, they were excluded from the final merit list of 451 candidates published last year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-scraps-appointment-of-451-asst-profs-in-teachers-training-colleges/articleshow/81639318.cms||Debashish Karmakar

No liquor was sold in the state over a month and a half so why should the government take licence fees for this duration,” he said.

---||Rajkot||Blind belief, misinformation hampers vaccination drive in Rajkot||RAJKOT: The Rajkot district health officials are in a fix as nearly 50 villages are opposing the Covid-19 vaccination one grounds of superstition, blind belief and misinformation. On Sunday, a team of health officials visited Satda village nearly 25 km from Rajkot city to convince the people for vaccination. They got the response that nobody was infected with coronavirus in the village because of the grace of their local deity. The villagers told the health officials that they would offer prasad to the goddess for keeping them healthy. They asked the health officials not to enter the village as it would upset their deity. Several village panchayats have written to the district administration (TOI possess three such letters) asking district officials not to enter their village for the vaccination. These villages include Parevda gram panchayat, Barvan gram panchayat and Mesvada gram panchayat. Hasmukh Limbasiya of Mesvada village said, “I tried to convince the villagers to take the vaccine, but they are not willing to do so for various reasons. They think that they are healthy and they don’t need it. They have the blessings of their god.” When contacted Rajkot chief district health officer (CDHO) Nilesh Shah said, “Compare to urban areas, we are facing difficulties in convincing the villagers to take the vaccine. We have received letters from several gram panchayats that people there are not ready for vaccination. From today (Monday) we have asked all the political leaders at district level, prant officers, talatis, nodal officers to form a team and try and convince the villagers.” Another health officer said that they even roped in a bhuva (shaman) in a village of Vinchhiya taluka to convince the people that they should take the vaccine shots, but that move too proved to be a failure. The vaccination drive for the third phase for senior citizens and patients with comorbidities (aged between 45 to 60 years) was started in 310 community health centres and primary health centres in Rajkot district. The vaccination program was extended to every village from Saturday, where public buildings were used as vaccination centres. The health officials are now giving priority to those villages, where people are less hesitant about vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/blind-belief-misinformation-hampers-vaccination-drive/articleshow/81637391.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Significantly, in several wards, BJP karyakartas who were pitted against those supported by Cabral, turned up trumps. Political observers said that the BJP had it relatively easy this time as the opposition parties had failed to throw any semblance of a challenge to the saffron-regime in the civic body. Nevertheless, several independent candidates contesting for the first time turned out to be the dark horses resulting in surprise upsets in many wards. The defeat of former chairperson Felix Fernandes, known to be among Cabral’s close aides, has been seen in local political circles as a major setback for Cabral. He was defeated by independent Damodar Bhende by 174 votes in a direct contest played out in ward 2. In ward 1, Cabral-backed candidate Guno Naik was relegated to the third position as independent Pramod Naik won defeating his nearest rival, Maruti Naik, also a staunch BJP karyakarta by 68 votes. Gayatri Naik in ward 12, known to be supported by Cabral, was defeated by independent candidate Aparna Prabhu Dessai. Pradeep Naik, a staunch BJP worker, won the polls from ward 4 in a five-cornered contest defeating his nearest rival Navin Khandekar, known to be from the Cabral-camp. However, the power minister’s staunch supporters, former chairpersons, Jasmine Braganza and Vishwas Sawant, emerged victorious with comfortable margins. Braganza contesting against debutant Siddesh Bhise in ward 5, won for the third time, while Sawant defeated Baburao Fatto Dessai in ward 13. Tony Coutinho, another Cabral-supporter won by a slender margin of 13 votes in a five-cornered contest in ward 6. A photo-finish was witnessed in ward 7 where BJP-backed Sushant Naik won by a wafer-thin margin of three votes, defeating his nearest rival Kishan Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dark-horses-upset-cabral-backed-candidates-but-bjp-manages-win/articleshow/81639967.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

Stating that BJP won six out of seven urban local bodies, Tanavade said that the results conclude that there was no impact by the opposition. “Twenty percent voters reside in the municipal areas and they have faith in BJP. The results also show that MLAs are doing good work in their respective constituencies,” he said. Even though the elections were not held on party lines, BJP MLAs went ahead and announced their panels, Tanavade said. “It was a first election for Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate after joining BJP and people have accepted him,” he said. Referring to opposition leader Digambar Kamat’s statement that BJP has been rejected in the polls, Tanavade said, “Congress has not opened its account in Valpoi, Bicholim, Pernem and Canacona, except Cuncolim. Kamat should not daydream,” Tanavade said. He said that BJP-backed candidates will win in Margao, Mapusa, Mormugao, Sanguem and Quepem municipalities that will go for elections soon. “Even if Kamat and Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai join forces, BJP will emerge victorious in Margao municipality,” Tanavade said He Tanavade said that it was inappropriate for any party worker to throw their weight behind other political leaders in the municipal elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/results-show-people-have-faith-in-bjp-party-chief/articleshow/81639993.cms||---
---||India||Kolkata: Ham radio operators reunite man with mom after 41 years||KOLKATA: Durga Prasad Timsina had been languishing as an undertrial for 41 years at the Dum Dum Correctional Home in Kolkata but the developments of the last two weeks have given him a new life. Not only did the Calcutta HC order his release on Wednesday, Timsina made it back home to Nepal to meet his mother, a reunion made possible by a sympathetic prison inmate, some detective work by a group of Ham radio operators in two countries and a lucky break. Now 72, Timsina, who was certified mentally unfit to stand trial for the murder that he had been accused of, could barely hold back his tears as he fed his mother some rasgulla as they sat together in their home in Lumbak village, east Nepal, while his brother Prakash Chandra looked on. Timsina, a school teacher, had last seen his mother in 1980 when he announced his intention to leave home and join the Indian army in Darjeeling. According to court records, the man who promised him the job embroiled him in a murder case. He has been in various prisons since then and may have continued to spend his life in detention but for a prison inmate who learnt of his condition.  Out on parole, the prison inmate discussed Timsina’s pitiful condition with a friend who was a Ham radio operator. The friend discussed this with his colleague and lawyer Hirak Sinha, who was vice-president of the West Bengal Radio Club (Amateur Club). The club then verified Timsina’s case by looking at his case history, medical records and meeting him. Communication was hard as Timsina’s mental age was that of a 10-year-old. “He was only able to write down three words in Nepali which turned out to be the name of his mother, his school and one more word that we could not identify,” Ambarish Nag Biswas, Club secretary said. The group got in touch with their counterparts in Nepal. Biswas said, “Some Nepal Ham members started looking for the school only to find that it had been flattened in the recent earthquake.” But as luck would have it, they found Timsina’s cousin. The group trekked for a whole day to reach the remote village of Lumbak, finally bringing to close the mystery of where Timsina belonged. After finding out that her son was alive, Timsina’s mother approached the Nepal consulate and pleaded for his release, which finally happened last week. On March 21, when Timsina reached Lumbak the huge crowd surprised him. “He looked a bit bewildered to see so many people. We fed him some rasgulla and sent some for his mother,” Biswas said. The Nepal and West Bengal Ham members have started a fundraiser to help him get back on his feet.

Fearing police action, victim Sunny Saxena’s friends and their kin buried his body in a pit secretly to hush up the matter, said police. As Sunny did not return home, his parents started searching for him and came to know that he was last seen on the tractor, said police. Sunny’s parents, said police, somehow managed to find the pit and dug out his body and informed police. An FIR was registered against five persons, including three minor boys, under sections 304 (culpable homicide) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code. Additional SP (rural) Sanjeev Bajpai said, “It appears the victim died in an accident when he was sitting on a tractor with his friends. After the accident, the victim’s friends got scared and informed their kin, who instead of informing police, secretly buried the body to hush up the matter.  But, the victim’s family managed to find the body with the help of police. We have impounded the tractor along with the rotavator and collected further evidence. An FIR was registered and the body was sent for autopsy. The accused will be arrested soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/boy-12-ploughing-field-with-friends-falls-off-tractor-dies-after-coming-under-rotavator/articleshow/81638350.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Mumbai||Saamna calls Param Bir Singh a BJP pawn, warns of ‘fire’ if govt under threat||MUMBAI: Saamna has alleged that the BJP was using former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh to topple the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) regime in the state. The Sena mouthpiece then warned that any attempt to bring down the MVA government would trigger “fire”. In an editorial on Monday, Saamna said the BJP was all set to malign the MVA by levelling spurious allegations, and that Singh was the Opposition’s latest “pawn”. The final aim of the Opposition is to clear the decks for President’s rule by creating an impression that the law and order machinery has failed in the state. New pawns are being created (to achieve the aim). It is clear that Singh is being used in a similar manner, said Saamna. The MVA faces unprecedented political turmoil in the wake of Singh’s recent letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray accusing home minister Anil Deshmukh of asking Sachin Vaze, the controversial assistant police inspector who is allegedly involved in the Ambani security scare case and the death of Thane entrepreneur Mansukh Hiran, of raising Rs 100 crore every month from the city’s bars and restaurants. A senior NCP politician, Deshmukh has since contested Singh’s charge. Stating that there could be a link between Singh’s letter bomb and the BJP’s gameplan to destabilise the MVA government, Saamna said, “The BJP was clamouring for Singh’s resignation in the wake of the Sachin Vaze row. Today, Singh has become the BJP’s darling. Till yesterday, the BJP thought Singh was not trustworthy. Today, they are chairing him on their shoulders and dancing their way to glory.” Saamna, which had praised Singh only last week for taking over the reins of the Mumbai police force during the “difficult times” of Covid-19, rapped the former CP for sending a letter to Thackeray hurling sensational charges at Deshmukh. “It doesn’t behove a senior police official to level allegations against the home minister and post it to the media...It is not within the rules for a police official to put the government in the dock...Singh ought to have exercised restraint,” said Saamna and, in the same breath, patted him for shouldering as CP several responsibilities to the best of his ability. Describing him as a hands-on officer, Saamna said he handled the Sushant Singh Rajput case and the Kangana Ranaut row well. Meanwhile, on the demand to impose President’s rule in the state, Sena leader Sanjay Raut said, “Instead, the Centre should be dismissed because this is an encroachment on the rights of the state through its agencies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaisaamna-calls-singh-a-bjp-pawn-warns-of-fire-if-govt-under-threat/articleshow/81639345.cms||Ambarish Mishra

An elderly man, Parshuram Mirekar (70), was arrested and four minor boys were detained on Monday. The Wanowrie police also booked five others on the charge of rioting and attempting to murder the couple and their son. Sub-inspector Bolenath Ahiwale said, “A group of children were playing cricket in an open plot outside the residence of Pushpa Thakur, a homemaker, on Sunday morning. The ball hit her on the back around 11am. On hearing her cries, her husband Deepak, an electrician, rushed out and instructed the boys not to play outside their house.” Ahiwale said, “Thakur told the boys that there were numerous complaints against them from the residents of the area. He said the ball was often hitting them, causing severe inconvenience. But the boys refused to listen to him and continued with their game.” He said, “Thakur then approached the children’s parents to apprise them of the problems he and the others faced. The boys reached there and started abusing Thakur for stopping them from playing cricket. Their parents joined them, and heated arguments ensued.” The sub-inspector said, “The children and their parents threatened to kill Thakur and beat him up. When his wife, Pushpa, and his son intervened, they were also beaten up. The suspects then attacked the trio with an iron rod, bat and stumps, and pelted stones at them, causing injuries on their heads.” Pushpa, the injured homemaker, stated in her FIR that they rushed to their home and shut the doors out of fear. She said they went to Sassoon General Hospital for treatment on their own. Ahiwale said, “We have recovered a bat and a stump used in the crime and have fanned a police team for arresting five others on the run.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1-held-4-detained-on-charge-of-murder-bid/articleshow/81638336.cms||---

Weatherman said Monday was the hottest March day in two years with the maximum temperature soaring to 37.7 degree Celsius, nearly four degrees above the normal. The minimum temperature was also about two notches above normal did not dip from 18.4 degree Celsius. In March 2020, the hottest day was March 31 when maximum temperature was 34.4 degree Celsius. The month of March is known for pleasant weather, but this year temperatures have remained above normal so far, barring a spell of thundershowers in the second week. State Met director JP Gupta said that Tuesday might witness a change in weather conditions due to cyclonic circulation hovering over northwest Rajasthan. This cyclonic circulation has been induced by the Western Disturbance over the hill areas. Besides, there is a high moisture feed from Arabian Sea. These factors together are expected to cause light to moderate rains accompanied with thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds in some parts of the state, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/showers-spell-to-turn-mar-pleasant-again/articleshow/81640024.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Sources said that Rane had “unofficially” supported his candidates, even though there was not much opposition. Interestingly, after Umesh Gulelkar from ward 3, whom Rane had openly supported, lost the election to Vinod Haldankar, the Valpoi MLA ushered Haldankar into his panel. In all, there are four new faces in the Valpoi Municipal Council (VMC), including Nirmala Sakhalkar from ward 8 who was elected unopposed. Speaking to reporters, Rane said, “I am happy my panel won the elections, and I thank the people for voting for my candidates. I assure you that all the 10 councillors will work for the betterment of Valpoi.” He said people voted for his candidates after considering the development he has done in Sattari over the years.

According to the SOPs, the pilgrims will have to register themselves online and dharamshalas as well as hotels and guest houses will have to screen people before giving them rooms to stay. The administration has also urged people over 60 years to avoid coming to the mela. The pilgrims have also been asked to not cook inside the forests to avoid forest fires. The mela, which was called off last year a few days after it began due to the Covid-19 threat, will be held from March 30 to April 30 this year. Meanwhile, on Sunday, a fire broke out in the hill on which the Purnagiri temple is situated. Sources said that there were around 4,000 pilgrims in the premises at the time of the incident.

---||Mumbai||In Parliament, BJP MPs, ministers seek MVA govt’s dismissal||NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: In a highly unusual sight, the treasury benches and even ministers raised the “Rs 100 crore collection” charge against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in Parliament on Monday, demanding MVA government’s dismissal. In Rajya Sabha, information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar, rising to reply to a question from Congress MP from Chhattisgarh Chaya Verma, said he could not hear the member in the din but he had indeed heard of “vasooli culture” in Maharashtra which was a terrible shame. Javadekar said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had no moral authority to continue in office. “What does it show if his trustworthy personnel plant bombs as alleged by the ATS?” he asked. Meanwhile, in Nagpur, state BJP president Chandrakant Patil said the party unit would not formally approach the governor to push for President’s rule in Maharashtra. Patil said, “We will not take any delegation to the governor for demanding President’s rule. However, we will convey the message to the governor through our press conferences and public speeches. We will urge him to inform the Centre about the situation here. But no, we definitely won’t formally put forward any proposal to the governor directly.” To the discomfiture of Sena benches in Lok Sabha, minister of state Anurag Thakur deviated from answering a query on corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to remark that he had heard of extortion demands in Maharashtra. He was responding to a question put by a Sena MP whom he told that the most CSR spending was in the state. BJP MPs also demanded a CBI inquiry into charges made by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Rajya Sabha was adjourned soon after zero hour began amid uproar over BJP members trying to raise corruption charges levelled by Singh against Deshmukh. The matter, though, dominated discussions in Lok Sabha during zero hour with at least half-a-dozen BJP members raising concern over the seriousness of the charges that had “acquired national importance”. The opposition, led by Shiv Sena, rejected the resignation demand with party MP Vinayak Raut claiming an attempt was being made for the last 14 months to remove the MVA government and install BJP. “This has completely failed,” he said and blamed the NDA’s “corrupt policies’” behind recent controversies in the state. Congress said it would not tolerate any attempt to interfere in state matters by involving central agencies. Raising the matter in Lok Sabha, Manoj Kotak, BJP MP from Mumbai, said a DG rank officer had written to the CM informing him about the home minister asking an assistant sub-inspector to collect Rs 100 crore. “This ASI is today in NIA custody for planting a vehicle laden with gelatin sticks (in front of industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s Mumbai residence),” he said while seeking the Maharashtra home minister’s resignation. Kotak was joined by other MPs from BJP such as Girish Bapat and Poonam Mahajan and independent MP Navneet Rana in demanding the home minister’s resignation and an impartial probe by CBI into the allegations made against Deshmukh. Ravneet Singh Bittu of Congress said the whole controversy was an attack on federalism. He said wherever there was an opposition-led government, central agencies were involved to dislodge the government. He said Maharashtra would not tolerate if “outside agencies” were involved. Former BJP finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar demanded governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari immediately send a report to the President on the current situation in the state. “Allegations levelled against Deshmukh are extremely serious and need to be probed by a Supreme Court or High Court judge or by the CBI. The governor should seek a detailed report from the chief minister and send it to the president after verification,” he said, adding the chief minister has not even bothered to issue a statement regarding the allegations made by Singh against Deshmukh. Referring to the report sent to the President in September 1980 when Sharad Pawar led Progressive Democratic Front government was in power leading to imposition of President' rule in Maharashtra, Mungantiwar said a similar situation exists today. Opposition leader in the legislative council Pravin Darekar met the government and held a discussion with him on the sliding law and order situation in the state. Meanwhile, a delegation led by Prakash Ambedkar, grandson of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) leader, met Koshyari on Monday over the alleged nexus between criminal elements from the state administration and political parties in the state and demanded that the governor should recommend dissolving the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and presidents rule be imposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-parl-bjp-mps-mins-seek-mva-govts-dismissal/articleshow/81640664.cms||---

The number is 50% of those vaccinated in Nagpur district in a day. As per the data of the state’s public health department, 5,053 persons from the 60-plus age group and 1,562 in the 45 and above category with specified comorbidities took the jab in Gadchiroli district between March 1 and 20. The district is now the lowest among the state’s 35 districts. In Nagpur district, 1,61,531 from the age-appropriate group were vaccinated in the first three weeks. The daily vaccination of this group is over 13,000. “Vaccination of people from the age-appropriate group was less in the district in the initial days due to less number of centres. Inoculation for this age group started at 14 centres at the district general hospital, sub-district hospital, rural hospitals and two private hospitals. There are only two private hospitals which are empaneled under the government’s scheme,” district civil surgeon of Gadchiroli Dr Sameer Rudey told TOI. The number of beneficiaries is likely to increase. “Last week, we increased the number of centres to 61. We started vaccination at 47 public health centres (PHCs) which are located across the district. People from rural areas were not coming to the tehsil or district headquarters for vaccination. These PHCs are closer to all villages,” he said. The state government did not allowed vaccination in PHCs without an indoor set-up in the first two weeks. Another issue for Gadchiroli district is that vaccination will be done at PHCs only thrice a week — Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. Regular immunization of children is conducted on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday. Dr Rudey said there were no apprehensions among people from the district about the vaccine. “People from villages situated in far off places are walking nearly 12 kms and taking the vaccine. Anganwadi sevikas and ASHA workers are mobilizing eligible people for the inoculation. They are visiting houses and recording details of eligible candidates,” he said. Gadchiroli is also facing problem of poor internet connectivity at PHCs. “We are also ensuring prior registration of eligible people after receiving data from ASHA and Anganwadi workers so that the issue of internet does not affect vaccination,” said Dr Rudey. As per the state’s data, Covid-19 positive cases are only 9,634 in this district, making it the third lowest in the state after Hingoli (6,007) and Sindhudurg (6,911). Similarly, deaths are fewer, 106 on record.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gchirolis-inoculation-of-sr-citizens-comorbid-50-of-citys-1-day-count/articleshow/81637421.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The commercial project, comprising a combination of SEZ and non-SEZ development along with MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions), star hotel, retail and entertainment facilities, is slated to come up on an 80-acre plot over a period of 8-10 years, A Srinivasa Rao, CFO, My Home Constructions Pvt Ltd, told TOI. Rao indicated that this could be the most expensive project to have ever been taken up in Hyderabad and would be developed as a premium business district on the lines of Gurugram’s Cyber Hub that was developed by DLF. The company has roped in architects from Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea for the yet-to-be named project, which is expected to kick off with a 4-8 million sq ft construction in June this year in the initial phase, he explained. “The earthwork excavation has begun at the site and we have applied to the authorities for various approvals that are expected to come in by May end,” Rao said, adding that initial plans include developing only about 60-63 acres. While currently the group has not roped in any development partners, like it did with RMZ Group for the Sky View project in Madhapur, Rao said they are open to single or multiple partnerships for the project. My Home Group has completed 24-25 million sq ft of development across residential and commercial projects and has another 11-12 million sq ft under construction, including the 1.1 million sq ft Twitza project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/at-2bn-largest-it-hub-to-come-up-at-kokapet/articleshow/81640662.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

After facing hurdles in operating five kiosks opened on a pilot basis in 2018-19 followed by the Covid pandemic, the project was put on hold . The civic body has, however, decided to re-launch the programme after minor changes. It now has a provision for providing food at subsidised rates as well as permission for sale of food/confectionary items on MRP at these kiosks. There is a plan to establish 40 such kiosks at various places in south Delhi. “Initially, 10 kiosks with inbuilt kitchen mobile vans will be placed in each of the four zones and later their numbers will increase/decrease depending upon the requirement. The corporation will provide a bare space to the bidder, who will be allowed to construct eco-friendly kiosks with no permanent construction. The bidder will bid considering its revenue potential and SDMC will not be responsible for (if) losses,” stated the proposal, which will be placed during its house meeting before final implementation. A senior SDMC official informed that the outlets will sell breakfast from 8-11 am and lunch from 12 noon to 3pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/south-corpn-clears-move-to-resume-rs-15/plate-scheme/articleshow/81640056.cms||Vibha Sharma

Prison officials have already been vaccinated in the last few days. The vaccine drive has commenced elsewhere among the prisoners, with the count being the highest at Arthur Road Jail, Mumbai, as the prison department there was hit severely during the peak of the pandemic. At Nagpur Central Jail, 244 prisoners and 89 jail personnel have tested positive so far. At present, one convict is undergoing treatment and around 10 prison personnel are in home quarantine. Jail superintendent Anup Kumre said he would meet the Nagpur Municipal Corporation chief and the collector. “We are planning to start vaccination drive inside the prison, for which assistance from the civic and district administration would be required,” he said. “After the senior citizen prisoners, we will go for the category of 45-60 years with co-morbidities,” he said. Apart from the vaccine drive, the jail authorities have revived the routine of following Covid norms stringently inside the prisons with the use of masks, maintaining Covid distancing and frequent cleaning of hands. “Around 59 newly-arrived convicts have been quarantined at the Mangalmurti lawn adjacent to our premises as a temporary facility, where they would be kept under observation for at least 8-10 days before being taken inside the jail if there are no symptoms,” said Kumre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/central-jail-prisoners-to-get-the-jab-soon/articleshow/81637414.cms||Soumitra Bose

The event, 47th Junior National Kabaddi Championship, was organised by Telangana Kabaddi Association. A video of the gallery crumbling and falling on to spectators went viral on social media platforms. Junior players from across the country had gathered at Guntakandala in Suryapet at around 6.30pm to participate in the national-level championship, Suryapet police said. As thousands of spectators were expected, the organisers had put in place multiple galleries to accommodate nearly 5,000. The largest gallery, where at least 2,000 spectators could be accommodated, collapsed, catching them unawares. All hell broke loose following the mishap. Several people were caught underneath the scaffolding. The injured were immediately pulled out from the gallery and they were seen being lifted by other spectators. The injured were put in ambulances and other vehicles and shifted to hospital, where all were out of danger. A person suffered grievous injury, but he was also out of danger. Poor scaffolding arrangement and overload was suspected to be the reason for the collapse, police said. “Three galleries, to accommodate 5,000 spectators, were set up for the event. The largest gallery was the one which collapsed,’’ Suryapet superintendent of police R Bhaskaran told TOI. Energy minister G Jagdish Reddy visited the hospital where the injured were being treated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/60-hurt-in-suryapet-at-kabaddi-event-mishap/articleshow/81640661.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Raped for 8 months, teen sisters get pregnant||PILIBHIT: Two sisters, aged 16 and 18 years, were allegedly raped multiple times over a span of eight months by the supervisor of a mineral water plant at a village on the outskirts of Uttar Pradesh's Pilibhit city. Both the siblings, who worked at the plant for filling the water containers, are now pregnant. Their mother was also abused and threatened by the plant owner, when she complained against the supervisor. The woman's husband passed away nine years ago and she had been struggling to make a living with her five daughters and a son. Her eldest daughter was working for a government scheme in Delhi while her two other daughters were working at the mineral water plant. One of the sexually abused teenagers is doing graduation while the other is in intermediate. Their daily job was to fill about 100 containers. And they were paid 80 paisa per vessel. The plant supervisor, identified as one Ravi Yadav of Bailha in Bihar's Khagaria district, first raped the younger sibling last May, on the promise of marrying her. The sexual assault continued for months even after she became pregnant. In July, he started raping her elder sister - often threatening to throw them out of work. The plant owner later suggested to their mother of marrying off both her teenage daughters. He even sent his driver to the woman's house who hurled abuses and made serious threats of sexually assaulting her other three daughters. The driver tried to molest her, the woman said. On March 13, the elder sister suffered a miscarriage and she fell very ill. Seeing her frail daughter in front of her, the widowed woman finally mustered enough courage to lodge a complaint with the police against the supervisor, owner and driver. The police have registered an FIR against the three. The supervisor was picked up, and sent to jail on Monday. The other two are yet to be arrested. SHO Shrikant Dwivedi said the three accused have been booked under IPC sections 376 (rape), 452 (house trespass), 354 (applying force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 504 (intentional insult), 506 (criminal intimidation), 323 (causing hurt) and sections 3, 4 of the Pocso Act. "All I look forward to is justice now," the mother of five young daughters said.

---||Delhi||Cost Of Power? 218 Deaths In City Every Year, Says Report||New Delhi: A report by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) estimated that the emissions from 12 power plants in 300-km radius of Delhi-NCR has resulted in 218 deaths in Delhi and 682 in districts of Delhi-NCR annually. The report, “health and economic impacts of unabated coal power generation in Delhi-NCR”, which was released during a webinar on Monday, estimated 4,830 annual deaths nationally due to the emissions from these 12 power plants. “The analysis was done considering the emissions of different pollutants from these plants, meteorological factors, dispersion and exposure of particulate matter to a graded population,” said Sunil Dahiya, analyst, CREA. According to the CREA report, if the power plants would have followed the 2015 emission standard notification, they would have negated 3.2 million work absence days, over 4,700 preterm births, about 7,700 asthma emergency room visits, and approximately 3,000 COPD cases in 2018 across the country. “Delays in installing sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NOx) control facilities are leading to over 13 deaths and Rs 19 crore cost burden daily in the country, which could be reduced by 63%, if all the power plants install pollution-control devices and operate at same plant load factor (measure of the output of power plant against its overall operating capacity) as they operated in 2018,” stated the report. The assessment of the emissions showed that coal-fired power plants operational within 300-km of Delhi-NCR in 2018 led to a cost burden of nearly Rs 6,700 crore to the population in the country, and of these, Delhi faced the burden of Rs 292 crore. The study also revealed that during 2018, over 2,110kg mercury was emitted into the atmosphere by the 12 operational coal fired power plants in and around the national capital. CREA’s research highlighted that the health and economic impacts of coal-based power generation in Delhi-NCR were not limited to the region, but to many states. “Precursor gases, such as SO2 and NOx emitted by the power plants go on to form secondary particulate pollution, which can then travel hundreds of kilometers, exposing populations far from the point of origin to incremental hazardous pollution levels. Our study shows that this contribution was as high as 96% for Delhi-NCR from operation of 12 thermal power plants. It is important to reduce the emissions of SO2 & NOx if we want to control air pollution,” said Dahiya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cost-of-power-218-deaths-in-city-every-year-says-report/articleshow/81639334.cms||---
---||Bhopal||BJP celebrates 1 year of Shivraj Singh Chouhan government, highlights achievements||BHOPAL: Celebrating one year of Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP on Monday released black balloons tied with the pictures of Congress leaders in the sky to mark the end of Congress government in the state. The BJP has planned a four-day event all over the state to highlight the achievements of Chouhan government. "The 12 months of BJP rule was far better than the 15-month rule of Congress that ended on March 20, 2020. The Congress deceived the public, lied to the farmers in the name of loan waiver to grab power and promoted corruption during its rule. The BJP instead paid Rs 1.18 lakh crore to the beneficiaries under various schemes to provide relief," said BJP district head Sumit Pachouri. BJP leaders held a gathering with posters of Congress leaders and released black balloons tied with the pictures as a mark of protest against Congress rule in the state. "The BJP workers will encourage and help common people in all wards to get vaccinated. BJP teams have been deployed in all government hospitals, municipal offices and private hospitals to provide assistance. People should be fearless and get vaccinated to save their life from the corona infection," said former Mayor Alok Sharma. During four-day event, the BJP will hold press conferences in each district to provide a comparative analysis of the 12-month rule of BJP government with the 15-month rule of the previous Congress government.  On March 23, the BJP workers will appeal to the public to use masks and follow social distancing norms. The same day, workers will break the coconut under "Vikas Ka Nariyal' drive to highlight the approval and completion of development projects. On March 24, beneficiaries of various welfare schemes will be felicitated in every village. While on March 25, BJP workers will encourage people to get vaccinated, said a state functionary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bjp-celebrates-1-yr-of-chouhan-govt-highlights-achievements/articleshow/81638437.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Nagpur Municipal Corporation to hospitals: Send all stable +ves to CCC or home isolation||NAGPUR: As the Covid bed availability scenario is becoming grimmer by the day in city, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Monday took a slew of measures to ensure citizens do not face any problem in finding bed for critical patients. The NMC has directed private hospitals to start triaging Covid patients and immediately refer all step-down ones and stable cases to Covid Care Centre (CCC) or in home isolation. The civic body will now follow up admission of all people, who call up its helpline seeking beds, and more private hospitals will be asked to start Covid treatment. As the Covid caseload is gradually shifting from private to public hospitals, both the tertiary medical colleges were asked to increase functional beds. Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) would be shifting its vaccination centre to pave way for 40 high dependency unit (HDU) beds at Ward 49, while Indira Gandhi Government Medical College & Hospital (IGGMCH) will be getting manpower to run as many beds. Both the medical colleges are grappling with shortage of doctors and nurses as many in-house staffers have tested Covid positive. The civic body is also recalling doctors and nurses who were recruited during the August-September Covid wave. The medical colleges too started shifting step-down patients to MLA CCC, which was re-started on Monday. Another 78 oxygenated beds will be run at Pachpaoli CCC, where staff training has commenced. The NMC has also asked Shalinitai Meghe Hospital and Research Centre (SMHRC) to restart 300 beds. This time, the hospital would function as Dedicated Covid Hospital (DCH). Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said civic chief Radhakrishnan B held a review meeting in the morning. “The civic chief has asked GMCH and IGGMCH to start more Covid beds. We have also asked railway hospitals to start Covid treatment or provide their staff for Ayush Hosptial at Sadar,” he said. Additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma said around 500 Covid beds were available as on Monday morning in private DCHs. “We have increased the number of hospitals and would be asking even smaller establishments to admit Covid patients. Our helpline is running and staff will follow-up callers till the patients get admitted. Our dashboard too displays updates of bed availability and we are trying to make it zone-wise so that people know which hospital is available in their area,” he said. Sharma advised citizens not to ask for specific hospitals as beds may not be available there. Civic officials have observed that people seek information about bed availability at specific hospital and this is causing an impression of bed shortage. Sharma also said that the city has 905 ICU beds in private hospitals. “Let the doctor or hospital decide what type of care a patient needs. Relatives themselves are deciding that their patient needs ICU,” he said. Regarding triaging, Sharma said, “Each bed is a scare resource now and hospitals have been strictly told to ensure beds are not unnecessarily occupied by mild patients, who can be treated at step-down facilities. This will ease pressure on tertiary hospitals.” Since last week, citizens are unable to get a bed in Covid hospitals easily as they are said to be running full following the surge in daily cases. On Monday morning, NGO TogetherWeCan received a couple of distress calls from citizens whose entire family has tested positive and some of them needed hospitalization. Some positive persons even ventured out in search of beds as NMC helpline didn’t respond, said a representative from the NGO.

Around one lakh square metre land has been allotted by the mela administration to seers of three Bairagi akhadas.

We also met with mela officials and asked them to allot land in Kumbh mela for the camping of Naga seers of seven Sannyasi akharas.” When contacted on Monday, mela officer Deepak Rawat told TOI, “We are serious about the issues of Bairagi saints and action is being taken accordingly. However, seven Sannyasi akharas also demanded land for their seers. We will take action in this matter after consulting the government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bairagi-seers-angry-over-mismanagement-sannyasi-akharas-demand-land-for-saints/articleshow/81638434.cms||MS Nawaz

Chicalim sarpanch Sebastiao Pereira had written to the MPDA member secretary requesting to depute experts for the meeting, and accordingly, public announcements were made at the local churches and temples. In response, a large number of villagers had arrived to attend the meeting. They demanded that the entire new draft ODP 2030 be placed at the forthcoming gram sabha next month. The villagers will await MPDA’s response to the fresh request to be made by the Chicalim sarpanch for a new date to hold the interaction with PDA experts. An official said that MPDA expressed its inability to depute their experts citing “unavoidable circumstances”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mormugao-pda-officials-fail-to-show-up-for-meet/articleshow/81640093.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Dudhwa tiger’s death a mystery as autopsy fails to nail cause of death||BAREILLY: Mystery surrounds the death of a tiger found near a canal in Dudhwa tiger reserve’s Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary in UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri district on Sunday. Its autopsy report could not ascertain the cause of death. It is the third tiger to die in March in the state. There were no visible injury marks on the carcass of the tiger when it was found some 24 hours after its death. The tiger was nine years old and appeared to be healthy. A slight swelling around its neck had given rise to suspicion of possible foul play. Its autopsy report said all its organs were intact and barring a perforation near the ribs, no internal injury was found. Speaking with TOI, Sanjay Pathak, Dudhwa field director, said, “It was the same tiger that had been stalking a tigress with cubs in Kishanpur and had killed its cubs in the past. The autopsy was done by a panel of experts from Indian Veterinary Research Institute in Bareilly but the cause of death couldn’t be ascertained. There was a perforation that could be caused by a porcupine quill but we will have to wait for pathological and toxicology reports before coming to a conclusion.” Pathak ruled out the possibility of poisoning or snaring as no such evidence was found at the spot where the carcass was found or during autopsy. “It is sad that Dudhwa has lost a tiger but it is also a natural phenomenon that nearly 20% of the population of a species is lost every year due to natural reasons.” A wildlife expert said, “There is a possibility of poisoning as the tiger’s carcass was found near a canal. A tiger goes towards water when poisoned. This tiger had killed cattle as it lived around villages in the core area. Someone may have poisoned it in retaliation.” Earlier this month, an adult tiger was electrocuted in a field near the social forestry area of Lakhimpur Kheri district on March 1, when it came in contact with electric fencing laid by poachers to trap wild animals. Within a fortnight, on March 15, the carcass of a tigress was found in Mala forest range of Pilibhit tiger reserve. The tragic loss was compounded with four cubs, spotted near the carcass, going missing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/dudhwa-tigers-death-a-mystery-as-autopsy-fails-to-nail-cause-of-death/articleshow/81638429.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Somaiya, who was in Nashik, told the media: “The state government should take action against one of the two individuals. If Singh has made false allegations against Deshmukh, the state government should immediately dismiss the IPS officer. However, if Deshmukh is at fault, then the government should ask him to resign or oust him from the ministry,” he said. Somaiya reminded the MVA coalition partners that a recent editorial in Sena’s mouthpiece ‘Samana’ had described Singh as a good police officer. On the other hand, the NCP leadership has backed Deshmukh while pointing fingers at the IPS officer. “People in the state are wondering how a top police officer can level such serious allegations against the home minister. The government must tell people the truth,” he said. “NCP chief Sharad Pawar and his party functionaries have called Singh’s allegations baseless. The home minister has said that he would file a defamation case against Singh. But why is the government not sacking Singh if he is at fault?” he asked. Somaiya further asked the government to track down anyone who had used arrested police officer Sachin Waze’s vehicles. Waze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with an explosives-laden vehicle found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house.“It is surprising that a large number of high-end cars were used by Waze. The police and transport minister Anil Parab should immediately come out with the names of all the people who were using these cars,” Somaiya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mva-govt-must-act-against-either-singh-or-deshmukh-somaiya/articleshow/81639344.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Earlier on Sunday, the CM, during an event to mark the International Day of Forests at Ramnagar, referred to the distribution of food grain during the pandemic and said every affected household was given 5 kg of ration per member. “Those having 10 children got 50 kg while those with 20 got one quintal. People with two children got 10 kg. People built stores and found buyers,” Rawat said, adding that he never ate such fine rice. “Who is to blame for this,” the CM asked. “Now, you are jealous of it. When there was time, you produced only two. Why didn’t you produce 20,” Rawat said. Also, in a goof up during his speech at the programme, he apparently confused Britain with the United States and said America enslaved India for over 200 years. Slamming CM’s remarks, former state chief minister and Congress leader Harish Rawat said, “I am amazed at his knowledge of history. He believes that the US ruled over India for over 200 years. Whenever our CM makes a speech, one cannot do anything but laugh.” In a similar vein, AAP Uttarakhand in-charge Dinesh Mohaniya said, “He has made a series of controversial statements after being appointed as the new CM. Thus, the people of Uttarakhand have stopped taking him seriously.” The AAP leader added, “From comparing Narendra Modi with Lord Ram to criticising women for wearing ripped jeans, Tirath Singh Rawat is making all the wrong statements. And now, he has made a statement beyond imagination saying that people should have produced more children to get more ration during Covid-19 pandemic,” said Mohaniya. A few days ago, CM Rawat’s ‘ripped jeans’ remark drew flak from all corners. The CM had said women wearing ripped jeans send out a “wrong message to the society and children”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/congress-aap-attack-cm-on-controversial-remark-on-why-didnt-you-produce-more-children-to-get-extra-ration-during-pandemic/articleshow/81638441.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Delhi||A year on, Afghan Sikhs have a roof, but no identity or jobs||New Delhi: Chaibul Singh (25) was in Ghazni in Afghanistan on March 25, 2020, when he got a call from a family member informing him about an attack on Guru Har Rai Sahib Gurdwara in Kabul. The attack left 25 Afghan Sikhs dead, including Chaibul’s childhood friend and his uncle. Following this, many Sikhs and even Hindus from Afghanistan fled the country, even as the Covid pandemic raged on across the world.Almost a year on, NGO United Sikhs on Monday at an event paid tributes to those who died in the massacre, while honouring and providing assistance to families that had fled Afghanistan and were now residing in Delhi.In September 2020, Chaibul came to India on an emergency flight with eight other family members. They are yet to be officially classified as refugees or citizens of India. They have no Aadhaar card, which makes it difficult for them to find a job.“That one incident changed our lives. While we had shops and homes there, we had to leave everything behind. Now, I work here for Rs 8,000 and my younger brother does a menial job earning Rs 7,000 a month. Lack of documentation and difficulty in speaking Hindi also works against us. We used to speak Pashto or Punjabi in Afghanistan. People find it difficult to understand my Punjabi dialect here,” added Chaibul.In addition to their earnings, Chaibul and 11 other families have been receiving Rs 15,000 each month from the NGO.Parvinder Singh Nanda, director, United Sikhs, said while they had been working hard to support these families, it was difficult for them to sustain themselves on their own. “To even get medical treatment, they require money and some ID proof. We have helped them get passports and also provided them free medical assistance through the Delhi government. The next step is to seek assistance from the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, the process for which is under way,” he added.Surbeer Singh (39), who also fled Afghanistan, said the memories of the horrid day were still fresh in his mind. “I cannot get out of my mind the image of the three-year-old girl who was killed in the massacre. There were children, elderly people and women in the gurdwara that day. The attack left people in shock. While we never feared anything earlier, this incident changed that and we started looking at other options,” Singh added.“The Indian government has helped us to a large extent. They brought us to the country through emergency flights. I know of at least 87 families who came to India along with mine,” said Surbeer.Rajmeet Singh (30) said every Afghanistani Sikh knows each other through someone as they are a close-knit community. The attack led most of the families consulting each other to flee the country. “We had to leave everything behind, including our jobs and homes. Over here, we are still hunting for jobs and are unsure of what the next day will bring,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-year-on-afghan-sikhs-have-a-roof-but-no-identity-or-jobs/articleshow/81639340.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Kozhikode||K C Rosakutty resigns from Cong, to work with LDF||Kozhikode: In yet another blow to Congress in Wayanad just days ahead of the polls, senior party leader and KPCC vice-president K C Rosakutty resigned from the primary membership of the party and announced her decision to side with LDF. Rosakutty, who is the former chairperson of the Kerala state women’s commission and a former MLA from Sulthan Bathery, said that her resignation from the party was in protest against the constant neglect faced by women in the party and that she was also disappointed by the groupism and adjustment politics which was governing even candidate selection in the party. She also expressed her discontent in fielding a person from outside the district in the Kalpetta assembly constituency. “I had taken the stand that a person from Wayanad should contest in Kalpetta constituency, which is the only general seat in the district. There are so many senior leaders and youth in the district who could be fielded there. But it has been a practice in the party to field persons from outside the district as candidates. Denying such limited opportunities available to party workers is not at all right,” she said. KPCC vice-president T Siddique hailing from Kozhikode is the UDF candidate in Kalpetta. Rosakutty said that she was also pained by the remarks made by some party leaders insulting former Mahila Congress president Lathika Subhash who had tonsured her head in protest against the under representation of women candidates. Later in the day, CPM leaders, including central committee member P K Sreemathi, district secretary P Gagarin, LJD state president and LDF candidate in Kalpetta M V Shreyams Kumar and LDF candidate in Sulthan Bathery M S Viswanathan called on her. Rosakutty told them that she would campaign for the LDF candidates in all the three constituencies in Wayanad. Wayanad district, which is represented by Rahul Gandhi in the Lok Sabha, has been witnessing a series of resignations by Congress leaders in recent weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/k-c-rosakutty-resigns-from-cong-to-work-with-ldf/articleshow/81639347.cms||---
---||Patna||State anthem must be sung at all govt functions: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar||PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said the singing of Bihar’s ‘Rajya Geet’ (state anthem) must be made mandatory at all functions/ events of the state government. Addressing the 109th Bihar Diwas programme through video conferencing, Nitish said, "Henceforth, the ‘Rajya Geet’ must be sung at all functions/ events of the state government so that a sense of respect for Bihar emerges in the mind of every people." He added that all schools have been directed to ensure the state anthem is sung at the prayer meeting. Bihar celebrates its formation on March 22 every year. The practice of celebrating Bihar Diwas began in 2010 at the CM's directive. Last year, the event could not be held due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Bihar was carved out of Bengal Presidency on March 22, 1912, through a notification by the British government under the provisions of the Bengal, Bihar and Orissa and Assam Law Act, 1912. Recalling the glorious past of Bihar, Nitish said, "If we all attempt together, we will again achieve the glorious past of Bihar and thus, we will re-establish our identity in the country and the world." Referring to the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in some states, the CM urged the people of Bihar to remain alert and cautious. He also asked people not to gather in large numbers to celebrate Holi and maintain the social distancing norms. "Recently, I held a meeting with all senior officials, including the DMs and SPs where everything was discussed in detail about the Covid-19 scenario. It is the time of the Holi festival. The officials should request the people not to publicly celebrate the festival in the wake of covid-19," Nitish said. Referring to the sharp increase in the number of fresh cases in Maharashtra and a few other states, the CM said, "What is the situation in Maharashtra today? Eight states have reported an increase in the fresh positive cases of Covid-19. We will be able to check the spread of the disease if Holi is not celebrated in large gatherings or at public places," Nitish said. He asked officials to make people aware of the danger of a fresh upsurge in the covid-19 cases in Bihar. "It is our duty to make the people aware and alert (of the situation). I will urge people of the state to remain alert and cautious," the CM said. Nitish also recounted the work being done by his government under the Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Abhiyan to minimize the impact of climate change. State’s both deputy CMs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary and additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar also addressed the main event held at the Gyan Bhawan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/make-state-anthem-must-at-govt-events-nitish/articleshow/81638454.cms||Madan Kumar

As very light rain was accompanied by gusty winds, the maximum temperature dipped below 30 degrees Celsius and remained below normal level on Tuesday. The city, meanwhile, recorded the highest minimum temperature on Tuesday at 21.5 degrees Celsius — four degrees above normal. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), “trace” rainfall was recorded at Safdarjung observatory — city’s base station— on Tuesday from 8.30am to 5.30pm, along with Lodhi Road and Ridge. The maximum temperature at Safdarjung observatory on Tuesday was 29.6 degrees Celsius— one degree below normal. A Met official said the temperature was expected to remain around normal over the next two days due to partly cloudy skies under the influence of a western disturbance. The maximum and minimum would remain around 31 and 19 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Wednesday. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist, IMD, and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said the mercury was set to rise from Friday, when the influence of western disturbance would fade away. “The maximum temperature will see a gradual rise from Friday and may cross 36 degrees Celsius for the first time this year on Saturday. The day temperature is likely to touch 37 degrees Celsius on Saturday,” said another official. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) on Tuesday was 244 in the “poor” category. Experts said, due to strong winds and rain, AQI might improve marginally on Wednesday. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said, “Surface winds are moderate and northwesterly. Better ventilation and wash out are likely to influence AQI positively, which may improve to the lower end of the ‘moderate’ category on Wednesday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-tastes-the-thunder-rain-cools-tempers/articleshow/81658229.cms||---

According to sources, preparations are being made by the district administration for its opening on March 26 or March 27. After struggling with deadlines in the past, Gorakhpur zoo started receiving animals from Lucknow and other zoos across the country in February. By now, at least 60 animals have moved to Gorakhpur, including lions from Gujarat. Gorakhpur zoo has many firsts to its credit. To begin with its design, its entrance is designed on the lines of Gorakhnath Temple and buildings look like Pagodas. The zoo sprawls over an area of 121 acres. Its biggest attraction is a 7D theatre which will screen wildlife movies. A natural 40-acre water body, which is a part of Ramgarh Taal and a patch of very dense forest with canopy density of 100% spanning over 30 acres, are located inside the premises adding to the beauty of the place. It will act as an exhibit area for the state government’s much-hyped One District. One Product (ODOP) Scheme. Besides displaying terracotta pottery, it will also display the name of the artisan. This will be the first zoo in eastern UP and second biggest after the Kanpur zoo. Gorakhpur zoo was planned and approved by the Mayawati government in 2009-10 and was proposed to be named after BSP founder late Kanshiram. The Akhilesh Yadav government did not do much for it except for renaming it after revolutionary Ashfaqullah Khan in May 2012. Almost immediately after coming to power in 2017, the BJP government revived the project by allocating Rs 13 crore to it on March 31, as a last ditch effort for the financial year 2016-17. The cost of the project pegged in 2012 was Rs 86 crore which was increased to Rs 118 crore in 2016-17. The zoo is worth over Rs 280 crore. Gorakhpur zoo can house 387 animals but will not be packed to capacity. Under the first phase of bringing in animals, 133 animals will be brought from zoos in Lucknow, Kanpur, Delhi, Vinod Van (mini zoo in Gorakhpur) and Etawah lion safari. In the second phase, animals from Mysore, Assam, Darjeeling, Allahabad (mini zoo that is closed) and Jharkhand will be brought. Gorakhpur zoo is getting animals as donations from other zoos since there are no animals to be exchanged. Zoos cannot buy or sell animals but only exchange them under a programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gorakhpur-zoo-set-for-a-roaring-start-this-week/articleshow/81640099.cms||Neha Shukla

The restoration plan includes removal of vilayati kikar (prosopis juliflora) and creation of a number of ‘natural’ attractions like forest trails, water bodies, cycleways and a recreational park.Environment minister Gopal Rai on Monday said, “The project will include the work of replacement of vilayati kikar by canopy lifting and planting with indigenous local species. It will help in eradication of vilayati kikar from the 423-hectare Central Ridge within a five-year period.”Rai said the advisory committee would meet every two weeks to monitor the progress of the project and ensure timely and effective on-ground compliance. The committee will also ensure the highest and aesthetical standards in the design of all civil works.The minister said the six-member advisory committee comprises private secretary (environment & forest) as chairman, principal chief conservator of forests and eminent environmentalists like C R Babu, Pradeep Krishen, Reena Gupta and Suditya Sinha.For restoration of the ridge, an MoU was signed between the forest and wildlife department of Delhi and Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystem. CR Babu, professor emeritus and head of CEMDE, who is overseeing the project, had earlier said vilayati kikar would not be removed, but ‘replaced’ naturally, strangulating it using over ten different varieties of creepers, including giloi, rubber vine, sagar gota and jal jamani. A number of native species have been chosen that will be planted along the invasive trees, with the top canopy to be cleared out to provide sufficient sunlight at the bottom.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/six-member-panel-to-monitor-ridges-restoration-says-rai/articleshow/81639353.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Sachin Waze case: Deshmukh status quo may strain Sena-NCP ties||MUMBAI: With the NCP taking a firm stand that home minister Anil Deshmukh will not resign from the council of ministers following former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegations against him, Shiv Sena finds itself in a spot. The NCP move could strain the party’s equations with the Sena amidst the unprecedented political crisis that has hit the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) regime in the state, said analysts. There is no question of Deshmukh stepping down from the state cabinet as Singh’s charges are baseless, Pawar reiterated at a press conference on Monday. Pawar left it to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to seek Deshmukh’s resignation or otherwise. “It’s the chief minister’s prerogative,” he added.

Officials also seized a register with details of financialClearly, with Pawar throwing his weight behind Deshmukh, Thackeray cannot press for the latter’s resignation, said observers. Deshmukh’s continued presence in the cabinet, though, may trigger public criticism against the MVA, of which Thackeray is the executive head. Also, the CM may find it difficult to placate his ministers if he retains Deshmukh as home minister, they added. Many in the Sena want Deshmukh to put in his papers in view of the magnitude of Singh’s charges. Read AlsoCharges against Maharashtra home minister aimed at derailing probe: Sharad PawarSharad Pawar on Monday ruled out state home minister Anil Deshmukh’s resignation. “The question of his resignation does not arise,” he said. The NCP chief said he had on Sunday termed the allegations as serious and suggested an inquiry but the new information had changed the situation.A section in the Sena is of the opinion that the NCP, which is in charge of the key home portfolio, can’t escape its responsibility and Thackeray alone can’t be made to face public ire. The Sainiks are quick to point out that Thackeray had sought party minister Sanjay Rathod’s resignation following an uproar over the alleged suicide of a Pune girl last month. “Uddhavji immediately sacked Rathod. Now, the NCP too should give marching orders to Deshmukh in view of the seriousness of Singh’s allegations,” said one.

Speaking during the two-day annual review of advanced manufacturing, real estate, sustainability, entrepreneurship, export and defence & aerospace organised by the northern region of the Confederation of Indian Industries, Awasthi said that to promote start-ups in the sector, UP government was looking at the possibility of setting up a common facility centre near Lucknow airport. Industries minister Satish Mahana said defence and aerospace were important sectors which would help India achieve the dream of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. “The government is making efforts to help the country become a net exporter of defence products from its present status as a net importer. India is among the top 25 defence exporters in the world and we need MSMEs to contribute in the growth of the sector,” he said. Chairperson of CII (northern region) Nikhil Sawhney suggested that the government should focus on developing India as a global defence original equipment manufacturer. Chairperson of CII Northern Region Defence Committee, Manoj Gupta, said under the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign, no global tender would be floated for procurement of more than Rs 200 crore which would be a huge boost to domestic players.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/upeida-ceo-for-focussed-attention-on-defence-sector/articleshow/81640102.cms||---

Not ready to accept the government’s decision, the group of morning walkers has decided to hold protest and demand for opening the parks. On Tuesday morning, the morning walkers will gather outside Sayajibaug to stage a demonstration. “We want the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) to open the parks for a limited time in the mornings. The gardens should remain open between 6 am and 8.30 am for the morning walkers. It would ensure that the gardens aren’t flocked all day by people,” said Vijay Wadhwani, a regular morning walker at Sayajibaug.The health freaks feel that after the lockdown last year, thousands of citizens began visiting the gardens for morning walks, yoga and exercise. “Closing down the parks is having a negative effect on people. Where will they take walk and exercise now. In times of pandemic, people need to keep themselves mentally and physically fit,” Wadhwani told TOI.He added that there is no evidence that parks and gardens are super spreaders. “In fact, people keep a lot of social distance and wear face masks in the gardens. We will also meet the municipal commissioner and make representation. The VMC should be concerned about the health of the people in times of such pandemic,” Wadhwani said.Sayajibaug, a sprawling park located in the middle of the city is home to a museum, a zoo, an amphitheatre and a bandstand. It was made during the rule of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III in 1879 and is still the most popular hangout spot for Barodians. The city is home to dozens of gardens that are maintained by the VMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/closing-down-public-parks-irks-morning-walkers-in-vadodara/articleshow/81637457.cms||Tushar Tere

The returning officer had kept aside the scrutiny of the nomination papers after UDF had raised allegations that Haji had omitted details about his second wife, who is said to a Pakistani national, from his election affidavit. They had also alleged that the candidate had not furnished full information about the assets owned by him. Following the three-hour-long hearing held at the collectorate on Monday, returning officer assistant development commissioner, Jai P Bal accepted Haji’s nomination papers. Haji had written ‘not applicable’ in the space allotted to provide the name of the spouse. He had, however, provided details of properties owned by his wife. UDF had alleged that Haji had two wives and that his second wife hailed from Pakistan, the information about whom was missing in the nomination papers. Election officials said that the nomination papers have been accepted as the information which the complainants mentioned about was found in the Part B of the nomination papers and that the other objection was only a clerical mistake. Meanwhile, Union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan criticized chief minister Pinarayi Viijayan for his silence on the issue. “KT Sulaiman Haji, a CPM Kerala-backed candidate in Kondotty has hidden the details of his 2nd wife, 19 years old Pakistani in his nomination. The so-called Liberal- Pinarayi Vijayan’s silence isn’t surprising,” Muraleedharan tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/ldf-candidates-nomination-accepted/articleshow/81639357.cms||---

The hospital will then have to identify a vacant bed for the patient in its cluster. Covid-19hospitals in the city have been divided into clusters with one of the bigger hospitals as the lead hospital. If there is no vacant bed in its cluster, the hospital will either look for a bed in a nearby hospital or shift the patient to one of the four hospitals where capacity has been increased recently. These hospitals include Dhiraj Hospital in Pipariya, Parul Sevashram Hospital in Limda, New Life Hospital in Pioneer Campus on Ajwa Road and Matrushri Davalba Ayurved Hospital in Babariya Institute in Varnama.

The exams were scheduled to take place from Monday and the schedule was displayed around two weeks ago. However, the university claimed that technical issues were reported by students, includin unable to log in during mock tests and not getting the login id and passwords for the portal through which the exam was to be conducted. Gajanan Palase, exam controller of SUK, said, “The exams for three courses have been called-off. We will soon declare new dates. Also, the exams for other courses will be held as per scheduled if no further technical issues arise.” The exams for the three streams were scheduled to be held from March 22 and expected to be completed in a month mainly before the start of board exams for students belonging to classes X and XII. Now, since the exams for the three courses have been postponed and there continues to be uncertainty over the exams for other courses, it is likely that the university may have to reshedule the exams entirely. However, Palase claimed that the exams for few other courses were held as per schedule on Monday and the students did not face any difficulty while taking the online as well as offline exams. It is the choice of student to opt for one of the two modes. Most of the students have opted for offline mode mainly citing technical issues. The papers are objective type for 50 marks with 25 questions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/suk-final-year-exams-for-3-streams-postponed/articleshow/81639361.cms||---

---||Delhi||Next CJI Ramana flags concerns at Delhi court event||New Delhi: Less than a month before he takes over the reigns of India’s judiciary, justice N V Ramana on Monday outlined some of his concerns, including lack of access to justice for the poor who can’t afford lawyers. Next in line to be appointed Chief Justice of India (CJI), justice Ramana reminded lawyers at an event in Delhi’s Rouse Avenue court complex that not everyone can pay their fee, urging them to also do pro-bono (legal aid for free) work. To drive home his point on challenges faced by poor litigants, justice Ramana recalled an incident from the time when he was Chief Justice of Delhi High Court. He said that an old lady waiting in the court premises asked him during an event “When will you put a cap on the fee lawyers can charge?” “I responded, the court cannot control these things. She asked me back — Sir, tell me how people like us can even come to the courts then?” the judge narrated. Addressing the lawyers the judge urged them to “understand the plight of those who cannot afford legal fees….extend a helping hand whenever you can! I believe that all lawyers should attempt to do some pro-bono work in order to give back to society and serve the people.” He explained that this is where legal aid assumes great importance. “When people cannot reach us, we should reach them,” justice Ramana told an audience that consisted Chief Justice of Delhi High Court D N Patel and senior judges of the high court and district courts of the city. The Supreme Court judge added that the idea of “access to justice” is deeply embedded in the Constitutional vision of justice and in a democratic country like India, it forms the very bedrock of “rule of law. Referring to the “dual realities” where Indians are a highly talented, sought after work force yet millions live without access to basic fundamental amenities of life, including access to justice, the judge stressed on the need to discuss these topics. “Although the reality is sad, the same should not de-motivate us,” Ramana remarked. As the senior most judge after the CJI, justice Ramana currently helms the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) which is celebrating its 25th year. He was speaking at the Delhi State Legal Service Authority’s (DSLSA) program to open front offices of district legal services at various court complexes of Delhi. In his presidential address, the SC judge informed the gathering that during Covid pandemic NALSA and its affiliates such as DSLSA helped 57,79,546 migrants in terms of transit, food and medical aid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/next-cji-ramana-flags-concerns-at-delhi-court-event/articleshow/81640105.cms||Abhinav Garg

---||Lucknow||Nodal officers to check distress sale of foodgrain by UP farmers||LUCKNOW: The Yogi government has decided to depute nodal officers to check the chances of distress sale of foodgrains by farmers during the wheat procurement season scheduled to start from April 1. The decision comes after the government announced increasing the number of procurement centres from 5,000 in 2020-21 to 6,000 in 2021-22. According to a communique sent by the food and civil supply department to all divisional commissioners and district magistrates, 15 nodal officers, mainly from the agriculture, cooperative and food and civil supply departments, have been assigned various divisions of the state. The officers would be responsible for active workability of wheat purchase centres, purchase agencies and storehouses in their jurisdiction. They would also ensure that the farmers get the due minimum support price (MSP) while selling their produce and do not face any kind of problem. The order issued by the food and civil supply department states that steps need to be taken to prevent distress sale by farmers. “For this, regular inspection of the purchase centres by the nodal officers will be crucial. The officials would be regularly giving their reports to the state government detailing about the smooth conduct of wheat procurement,” the order said.. State government data show that wheat procurement registered a dip from 37 lakh metric tonnes in 2019-20 to 35.7 lakh metric tonnes in 2020-21, mainly due to the wake Covid-19 pandemic. This was despite the increase in the MSP from Rs 1,840 per quintal in 2019-20 to Rs 1,925 per quintal in 2020-21. In 2021-22, the state government has increased MSP for wheat to Rs 1,975 per quintal. The officers have also been asked to ensure adequate wheat is earmarked for central pool. “In case of difficulty, officials would be reached out to get the problem solved,” officials in the food and civil supply department said. District authorities have also been asked to coordinate with the nodal officers for smooth conduct of wheat procurement in the forthcoming season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nodal-officers-to-check-distress-sale-of-foodgrain-by-up-farmers/articleshow/81640109.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Lucknow||Victim kin’s claim raises questions on govt: Mayawati||LUCKNOW: Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati has said that the allegations by the Hathras alleged gang rape victim’s family that they were being threatened has raised fresh questions over the government’s capability in giving justice to the victim. It also presses the point that lawlessness continues to thrive in Uttar Pradesh, she added. The victim’s brother had submitted an affidavit before the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court, alleging that their counsel and family members had received threats, specifically mentioning an incident which took place when trial proceedings were going on before the special court at Hathras on March 5, 2021. While taking up the issue,the Allahabd high court has said that it could also consider shifting the trial out of Hathras and constituted an inquiry to probe the charges. “It is now clear to everyone how the family of the unfortunate Hathras gang rape victim’s family is finding it difficult to get justice. The new evidence that has come to light in the court now raises serious questions about the steps taken by the government in this matter,” Mayawati said. She added that now with the high court ordering an inquiry into the allegations that the victim’s family members are being threatened, the UP government is once again in the dock while people are left wondering how the family will get justice this way. “Is it then wrong to think that in Uttar Pradesh, criminals rule and it is difficult to get justice,” Mayawati questioned.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Don’t get carried away by opinion polls: Pinarayi Vijayan to partymen||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said the pre-poll surveys are expression of certain opinions and LDF workers shouldn’t be negligent in taking on the election as a serious political fight. Speaking to reporters in Kottayam on Monday, he urged LDF workers to keep vigil and work hard for clinching victory. Over news reports that LDF government could just appoint 95,196 people through PSC over the past five years, Vijayan said those spreading such information didn’t consider the employees whose salary is not being disbursed through Spark Software. There are other departments and agencies like KWA and KSEB, the salary of the employees of which is not given via Spark. When adding appointments made to such agencies, the total number of appointments given in the past five years will be 1.55 lakh, he added. Those spreading the misinformation cover up the real fact and are doing so for political reasons, he said. The opposition is unnecessarily raising allegations that there had been corruption to the tune of Rs.5,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore in KIIFB projects. When the opposition fails to prove the allegations, they would come up with another allegation. At last, they would spread messages that there would have been huge corruption had there not been their intervention, the CM said. The unholy nexus between BJP and Congress is becoming more evident with each passing day. V Surendran Pillai, the UDF candidate from Nemom constituency in 2016, has revealed that Congress leaders sold votes to BJP last time. This helped BJP open its account in Kerala assembly in 2016, Vijayan said. BJP leader O Rajagopal who won from Nemom last time has revealed the deal with Congress, he said. Some of the prominent Congress leaders are trying to win with the help of BJP. BJP state president K Surendran’s statement that party will form government if it gets 35 seats is a testimony of the party’s unholy nexus with Congress, he said. Kerala Congress (M) is the single largest splinter group among Kerala Congress factions. The entry of Kerala Congress (M) into LDF fold has helped increasing the front’s mass base, Pinarayi Vijayan said, adding that this will be reflected in the election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/dont-get-carried-away-by-opinion-polls-cm-to-partymen/articleshow/81639382.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Crops on 20,538 ha damaged in M’wada||Aurangabad: The hailstorm and unseasonal rain during the past 48 hours have damaged crops and orchards on 20,538-hectare area in half of Marathwada region besides leaving 22 cattle heads and 221 hens dead, shows preliminary official assessment. More such damage is likely as the weather department has forecast that adverse weather conditions may continue for the next 48 hours. As per official report, Jalna is among the worst-affected districts as crops and orchards on 11,357 ha have been damaged, followed by Beed (7,247 ha), Aurangabad (1,519 ha) and Parbhani (415 ha). However, the remaining four districts of Latur,Osmanabad, Hingoli and Nanded did not incur any losses. As regards damage to livestock, 221 hens in Georai taluka of Beed district and 12 cattle in Jalna district died due to the natural calamity. Nagnath Talgude, a marginal farmer from Devadi village of Wadvani taluka in Beed district, said he lost tomato crop cultivated on nearly one acre of his agricultural land. “Rumours of a lockdown have already been leading to agricultural produce being sold at throwaway prices. The latest fury of nature has come as a double whammy for us. None of the government authorities have so far reached our farms to assess the damage,” he said. Farmer activist Jayaji Suryawanshi said the preliminary assessment of crop damage is an eyewash. “While crops and orchards on hundreds of acre of agricultural land have been devastated, the official estimate shows damage on only 20,000 hectare. It is a mockery of farmers who are already suffering due to the current pandemic,” he said. Aurangabad disaster management officer Ajay Chaudhari said the preliminary assessment may vary from the actual assessment. “The revenue department and other officials are supposed to carry out panchanamas of affected villages soon. The final report will be prepared based on their observations and sent to the government for necessary action,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/crops-on-20538-ha-damaged-in-mwada/articleshow/81636879.cms||Prasad Joshi

These are at Greater Kailash, Aurobindo Place, Nehru Place, Lajpat Nagar, Sarita Vihar, Hauz Khas, Vasant Vihar and South Extension Part II, among other places. The south corporation now aims to make 82 more e-charging stations operational by August 15. These include 47 for four-wheelers and 35 for two-wheelers. All these stations will be equipped with EV supply equipment, charger management system, meter box, LED screens and CCTV cameras. For uninterrupted power supply, the civic body has also decided to install pole-mounted transformers of 100 kilowatt each at the 18 stations that are operational. A senior SDMC official said that a joint survey for it was done by officials from BSES, civic body and other agencies concerned on Saturday. “These stations are mostly set up near parking lots and it was found during the survey that the required load was not available everywhere. There is a need for installing double pole-mounted transformers to ensure uninterrupted power supply. We have communicated the requirement to the company implementing the project. These transformers also look aesthetically good and occupy minimum space,” said Prem Shankar Jha, deputy commissioner, SDMC. “These e-charging stations are being set up by public sector units like Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) and Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited (BECIL). EESL is setting up stations at 45 places out of which 18 have become functional. BECIL will install charging stations at 20 places soon. Besides, we also have talks going on with Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd, which has expressed willingness to set up 35 stations for two-wheelers,” said Jha. The civic body aims to set up stations for two-wheelers next to bus queue shelters on the ring road so that more and more people can be benefitted. In 2019, SDMC had signed its first MoU with EESL for setting up these stations. “The response has been decent so far. It will increase as people get aware and more electric vehicles hit the road. After all the charging stations become fully operational, we expect to earn Rs 4-5 crore annual revenue from the 100 locations,” Jha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/by-aug-15-sdmc-targets-100-e-charging-stations/articleshow/81640126.cms||Vibha Sharma

He had taken the amount last year from a shopkeeper to go to his village in Siddharth Nagar, UP, after the lockdown began on the night of March 24. “Things changed overnight. Suddenly, there was no work,” said Yadav. “Having worked in Delhi for decades, some of us were hopeful and decided to stay put when others returned to their villages. But we were wrong. There came a time when we didn’t know where our next meal was coming from.” Dispirited, Yadav borrowed money and returned to his family. But after barely three months at home, he was forced to travel back to Delhi because there was no money left. “Since then, I have been struggling to find proper work,” he said morosely. TOI visited various markets in old Delhi area and spoke to traders and labourers about how tough the whole year had been and the support they now expect from the authorities. Rakesh Yadav, president, Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders Association and adhesive tape maker, recalled, “I did my best to support my employees financially so they wouldn’t have to leave Delhi. But after testing positive for Covid on June 25, things went out of my control. Then, the older workers requested more time to return from their villages, while others refused to join work due to fear of infection. I managed to get my shop open with the help of handcart pullers, but my godown is still closed and accounts haven’t been updated.” Many businesspeople have been meeting administrative officials and police to ensure the enforcement of Covid norms to avoid another crisis. Rajendra Sharma, president, Iron and Hardware Merchants Association, Teliwara, pointed out, “Every day, thousands of traders from across India visit the wholesale market, but there is no testing done to determine if they are infected. To prevent the situation worsening beyond control, we have requested the authorities to install at least some rapid antigen test vans to check outsiders.” During the lockdown, the medical market at Bhagirath Palace was twice closed down, but not for more than four-five days to ensure supply of medicines wasn’t hit. Shopkeepers there say implementing Covid norms is “extremely difficult”. The place is crowded and shops occupy all empty spaces, affecting any attempt at social distancing. “We can’t blame the authorities for this,” conceded Bharat Ahuja of the Delhi Electric Trade Association, Bhagirath Palace. “Though the traders did a commendable job of sanitising the market, unless they remove material from the public spaces, social distancing won’t be possible. We have, however, requested the authorities to make a few lanes one way.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/life-not-same-for-traders-workers-after-covid-19-forced-tools-down/articleshow/81658358.cms||Vibha Sharma

The girl is 18 months older than the boy. “The act of the minor boy was punishable in law, but he was acquitted in the larger interest of the lives of three minors — the boy himself, his minor live-in partner and their eight-month-old daughter. The order is an exception and it cannot be used to take advantage by anyone,” the court observed. The court directed the parents of the accused juvenile to treat the minor girl as their married daughter-in-law and the infant as their legitimate granddaughter and fulfil all their needs. Additional public prosecutor Rajesh Pathak said the trial had started on March 19 and concluded on Monday. “This is the first case in the country in which a trial has ended in just three working days. Earlier, a Madhya Pradesh court had completed a trial in four working days,” Pathak claimed. Pathak said an FIR alleging kidnapping of a minor girl by a local boy, his parents and the elder brother, was filed with the Hilsa police station on February 11, 2019. Later, the investigating officer removed the parents and the brother of the accused juvenile from the FIR as he did not find their involvement during the investigation. On July 19 last year, the minor girl appeared before the court and said she had run away with the accused juvenile on her own will to Delhi. The girl said they lived there as a couple and she had an eight-month-old daughter from the boy. “The juvenile accused, who was only 14 years of age, at the time of committing the ‘crime’, had surrendered in court on February 20 this year and was sent to a place of safety in Sheikhpura district,” said Pathak. Pathak said the parents of the juvenile accused agreed to the conditions of the court and the father of the girl, who was the complainant, consented not to pursue the case any further. The court also directed Hilsa Bal Kalyan police officer to submit a report of the well-being of the minor girl and her child every six months for two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/16-yr-old-boy-asked-to-take-care-of-minor-live-in-partner-child/articleshow/81639423.cms||Farrukh Nadim

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC says can’t stall redevelopment if most residents are for it||MUMBAI: Residents creating hurdles for redevelopment of a building, which is deemed unsafe for habitation and which has the approval of the majority of other residents, will now face dire consequences, including immediate eviction and a steep penalty. The Bombay high court, peeved by some members of a cooperative housing society holding up its redevlopment, has warned that such impediments will be dealt with strictly and without leniency. “The next time a similar matter is received, the court will first order immediate eviction of the dissenting member — vacating that very day, or at best the next — and then issue an order of costs, keeping in mind the costs incurred by the society, the loss to other society members, and the actual loss suffered by the developer on account of the delay occasioned by such members,” ruled Justice Gautam Patel in a case pertaining to Kandivli Basant Bahar CHSL at Dahanukar Wadi in Kandivli West. The court, in its March 19 order, also warned that the cost imposed on the dissenters “is unlikely to be moderate or modest”. Justice Patel directed two members of the Kandivli cooperative society — Ajay Rana and Richard Goveas — to vacate their flats by 5pm on April 30, failing which the court receiver will proceed to “forcibly evict and eject” them from the premises. The receiver will then give possession of the flats to the society, which in turn will deliver it to Westin Sankalp Developers, who filed the arbitration petition. Rana and Goveas will be entitled to all benefits under the development agreement on par with other members of the society, “but only from the date they vacate the flats and not earlier”, Justice Patel ruled. Rajesh Singh, the developer’s advocate, submitted in court that in October 2009, the BMC declared the structure with 14 flats unsafe for human habitation. In June 2018, the developer accepted the society’s offer, and building permission was received in November 2019. By February 2020, all members except the two agreed to vacate their flat. Till date expenses of around Rs 1.47 crore has been incurred, the petition stated. Justice Patel noted that the December 27, 2018 development agreement names every member of the society, and 12 members had signed it. However, Rana and Goveas’ advocate, R S Pachundkar, said they had not signed the agreement and were therefore not bound by the arbitration clause in it. But the judge said the law is exactly to the converse and “there is inherent evidence in the agreement itself that the benefits of the agreement inure to all 14 members,” including the two who had not signed it. “The law is that these two respondents must vacate. That is the development agreement signed by the society, and it binds the respondents…They have no choice in the matter. They will do what the law requires them to do,” said Justice Patel, adding that their conduct is undeserving of the slightest indulgence. The judge also said that it was the last time he was refraining from imposing severe penalties in such cases. He noted that in every similar case, the dissenting members have been “totally unmindful of the law” and that such practice “must be deprecated in the strongest possible terms”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaihc-says-cant-stall-redevpt-if-most-residents-are-for-it/articleshow/81639431.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The accused Kamal alias Kamlesh Chandwani, a resident of Althan, and his partner Ganesh Sinha were booked for Rs four lakh cheating in July 2020 following a complaint lodged by textile trader Sanjay Khairadi Chandwani approached a local court for bail but his application was rejected. He then approached the high court where he was asked to deposit Rs two lakh. “Instead of depositing the money in the court, Chandwani's son Varun produced the fake death certificate and other papers. Those papers were submitted in court after which the bail plea was disposed off,” said a police officer of Salabatpura police station. Cops found that Chandwani got a fake death certificate made by Dr Shag Patel of Siddhi Clinic and submitted it to Ramnath Ghela crematorium with some unidentified body. Later, based on the document issued by the crematorium, the family got a death certificate from Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) prepared. Meanwhile, Khairadi came to know about the fraud and approached the police with a fresh complaint.  Investigation also revealed that his family members had also approached insurance companies to claim the death claim using his forged death certificate. They have been booked under relevant sections of IPC regarding forgery and submitting forged documents in the court. “We found that Chandwani is involved in multiple cheating in Vadodara, Ahmedabad and Surat. He even defaulted on a loan payment and claimed insurance money as well,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/dead-textile-bizman-caught-splurging-in-mumbai-beer-bar/articleshow/81637512.cms||---
---||Goa||India need team effort to replace Chhetri: Stimac||Panaji: Igor Stimac was pleased with what he saw as he divided the India probables into two teams and played a 11 v 11 friendly in Dubai early this week. Stimac had watched all these players on television during the recently-concluded Indian Super League (ISL), but ahead of the two international friendlies against Oman (March 25) and United Arab Emirates (March 29), the Croatian coach wanted to be sure about his choices in match situations for the national team. Having trained under Stimac in the past, there were the experienced campaigners who knew exactly what to do. The newcomers, on the other hand, didn’t put a foot wrong. “They were going like rockets,” said Stimac, speaking with TOI over the phone from Dubai on Tuesday. “They were fighting really hard. I don’t want to take any (young) player’s name, but I can say I am happy with all of them. I am only sad I could not call everyone for the camp.” Stimac is expected to hand several youngsters their India debut during the two friendlies. There is the Hyderabad FC duo of Akash Mishra and Chinglensana Singh, both of whom could be part of a new-look defence, while the likes of Ishan Pandita, Lalengmawia and Liston Colaco could also get some minutes. “You have to be patient with the youngsters. They will have their chances. One game will neither make or break their careers. We need to handle them well,” said Stimac. While Stimac was impressed with the youngsters, the absence of Sunil Chhetri cannot be ignored. The India captain was infected with Covid-19 ahead of the camp and will be a big miss for the two friendlies. “You always miss a player like Sunil,” said Stimac. “He has an all-round game and influences this team as the captain, both on and off the field. The youngsters idolise him. I told the players that we need a team effort to replace him, like we did against Thailand (in the King’s Cup) and Qatar (World Cup qualifier). Each one will have to do a bit more on the field.” Stimac’s team has played Oman twice in the World Cup 2022 qualifiers, losing both games narrowly. At home, India led till the last 10 minutes, before the visitors scored twice. In Muscat, the hosts settled for a solitary goal victory. “Oman will provide us with a physical test. They have a new coach and are trying out (different) players, systems. They are strong with set-pieces and have physical strikers. There will be lots of fights in the middle (for the ball). “All that we have to do is focus on ourselves This is our chance to improve by playing quality opposition, rather than worry about points and rankings. India should get used to playing better sides,” said Stimac.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/india-need-team-effort-to-replace-chhetri-stimac/articleshow/81658305.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The exam was held in January 2021 for those students who could not appear in November 2020. The majority of the students who appeared in January were living in the containment zone or under quarantine. Gayatri Belwal secured 24th rank with 520 marks out of 800, while Manish More secured 26th rank with 518 marks. Belwal could not appear for the exam since her family was quarantined after her father’s colleague, an officer in railway police had died due to Covid-19 infection. As one from More’s family had died just before the exam in November last year, his family too quarantined. “The students have worked hard despite all odds and secured good marks,” said Ravi Chhavchharia, their tutor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/ca-final-two-from-surat-in-top-50/articleshow/81637705.cms||---

Later, district collector Sunil Chavan too visited the location and asked the police and state excise officials to take stringent action. The incident took place on Sunday noon, when the district was observing a complete lockdown. When contacted, ZP CEO Mangesh Gondawale said: “I, along with my team, was on field visit to a primary health centre in Waluj. We spotted a group of people gathered outside two houses. None of them were wearing masks and were clearly violating the physical distance norm.” The CEO found that illicit liquor was openly being served at these two adjacent houses located on the Kamlapur road. Immediately, the police and the collector were alerted. Taking serious cognizance of the same, collector Chavan personally visited the spot. Chavan said, “Despite restrictions on assembly of people, some were found illegally selling and consuming liquor in open. Moreover, this happening on a day when lockdown was in force, is very upsetting.” Police constables Sanjay Dandge and Sachin Rajput lodged the complaints against the two liquor dens. Subsequently, three men and a woman were booked under IPC section 269 for unlawful or negligent act likely to spread the infection and section 188 for disobeying orders duly promulgated by the authorities. In addition, the police have also slapped relevant sections of the Maharashtra Prohibition Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-action-against-illicit-liquor-dens/articleshow/81636894.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The driver, Manali Bhatia (29), a schoolteacher, was arrested and later released on bail. The guard, Dyandev More, was opening the gates of Gaurav Garden Cooperative Housing Society building to let the car in when the accident took place around noon last Wednesday. More was flung a few feet away and he landed on a parked vehicle. He sustained injuries to the head, and died a few hours after he was taken to hospital. Bhatia was arrested on the charge of causing death by negligence. The guard, who had worked at the same housing complex for two years earlier, had returned about a couple of months back from his village in Satara where he had stayed all through the lockdown. The entire family had left for their village last year in March just before the lockdown. Senior inspector of Charkop police station, Manohar Shinde, said that the deceased guard was at the entry gate when he went to open it. “All of a sudden, the car came charging towards him as the driver lost control and hit the gate.” He said that the car has been seized for an inspection which will be conducted by the Regional Transport Office to know the possible cause of the mishap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiteacher-hits-accelerator-instead-of-brake-kills-guard/articleshow/81639452.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

The connection was restored later following the intervention of senior officials.MSEDCL had issued a written letter on February 26 to the RTO located at Ghosapuri, asking the RTO to pay the outstanding bill of Rs 84, 350. The RTO was informed by the MSEDCL to clear the dues within seven days failing which, the power supply would be disconnected without any prior intimation.The power cut affected the work at the RTO as many people were unable to get their vehicles’ documentation done. Many licence applicants had to return after waiting for hours.Some people recorded videos narrating the inconvenience faced by them as the RTO didn’t give any information on the power crisis. The videos went viral on social media and the RTO authorities were severely criticised.While many questioned the government department on defaulting on payment of power bills, one of them highlighted the “lack of responsbility, duty and professionalism” amongst the RTO office staff.The criticism forced senior RTO authorities to intervene following which power supply was said to have been restored in the second half of the day.When contacted, RTO inspector Shaikh Feroz said, “I was not aware of the issue as I had been to a meeting at the district collector’s office.

When contacted, Meltron DCHC’s in-charge Dr Vaishali Mudgadkar said, “We have capacity of 300 beds, of which, 128 are oxygen (O2) supported beds. We keep some non-O2 beds vacant so that the patients, who have recovered well and do not require oxygen, are shifted to these beds.” She added that is is wrong to say that health authorities were refusing to admit patients despite availability of beds. In the video, the woman, who claims to be a resident of Chikalthana area, can be heard saying that she is diabetic and was referred to Meltron DCHC.

Adjourning the matter till August 3, the HC said, "…State counsel submitted that albeit the arrest of the petitioner has been stayed, the state be granted liberty to proceed in accordance with law. In the meantime, the interim order dated March 4, 2021, is modified. The arrest of the petitioner shall remain stayed, however, the prosecution/state would be at liberty to proceed with the matter in accordance with law." Justice Avneesh Jhingan of the HC passed these orders while hearing the pre-arrest bail plea filed by Saini. Saini had approached the HC after the district and session court Faridkot dismissed his plea for anticipatory bail in the case. While the state government has been opposing Saini's plea for pre-arrest bail on the grounds that he may influence the witnesses, Saini has been arguing that the investigating agency has no evidence against him. Saini was named as an accused in the Kotkapura police firing case in October 2020 and in January this year, the Punjab police’s special investigation team had filed a supplementary chargesheet against Saini. On receiving the chargesheet, a Faridkot court had summoned Saini to face the trial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-probe-against-saini-in-kotkapura-case-can-continue-arrest-remains-stayed/articleshow/81639445.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP, MP ink Ken-Betwa pact to drench parched Budelkhand||NEW DELHI / LUCKNOW: After resolving their differences over sharing of water from the proposed Ken-Betwa interlinking of river (ILR) project, chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Monday -- World Water Day -- signed a tripartite agreement with the Centre in virtual presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The PM said that the project was a realisation of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s dream. “This is a historic pact for the Ken-Betwa Link Project which will carry water from surplus to drought-prone and water-scarce areas through interlinking rivers,” he said. Noting how the project would benefit the entire water starved Bundelkhand region, the Prime Minister said rapid development was not possible without water security and effective water management. He added that the vision of India's development and India's self-reliance, is dependent on water sources and water connectivity. UP CM Yogi Adityanath said not only would it ensure drinking water to the parched areas of Bundelkhand, but also improve irrigation. “Bundelkhand is a land of bravehearts and its people will not be allowed to remain thirsty. Ken-Betwa river linking will help resolve the water scarcity and will bring prosperity in this region,” the CM said. He added that this project would pave the way for more river interlinking projects which would help to provide water to other water scarce areas. The signing of the agreement will pave the way for initiating other pending actions for implementation of the project which could not be taken up due to the states’ tussle over share of water during the non-monsoon period. The project is aimed at providing water to the parched areas of Bundelkhand, which include five districts of UP. The revised agreement will allow Madhya Pradesh to get additional water from the project which will be implemented at an estimated cost of over Rs 37,600 crore. The Centre will bear 90% of its total cost. Dispute between UP and MP could be settled when the former agreed to drop its demand for a higher share. Even MP has had to compromise. The Centre did not agree to its demand to allow it to use the entire quantum of surplus water at Daudhan dam site in the upper catchment area. The Daudhan dam is one of the key components of the Ken-Betwal ILR project. The Ken-Betwa project is the first in the National Perspective Plan to link rivers, said a government spokesperson, and will provide relief to the residents of the Bundelkhand, especially to the districts of Panna, Tikamgarh, Chhatarpur, Sagar, Damoh, Datia, Vidisha, Shivpuri and Raisen of Madhya Pradesh and Banda, Mahoba, Jhansi, Hamirpur and Lalitpur of Uttar Pradesh. UP Jal Shakti minister Mahendra Singh said that for UP it would increase the irrigation capacity in five districts of Bundelkhand by 2.51 lakh hectares, provide 67 million cubic metre (mcm) drinking water to about 21 lakh people and also generate 103 MW of hydropower. “Work has started to prepare a detailed project report. An agreement was initially signed between the Centre and governments of UP and MP in August 2005 but it is our government which has finally taken action on it. With this project, 37,564 hectare in Mahoba, 3,533 hectare in Lalitpur, 17,488 hectare in Jhansi, 26,900 hectare in Hamirpur and 1,92,479 hectare in Banda will be irrigated, while 14.66 mcm in Jhansi, 31.98 mcm in Lalitpur, 2.79 mcm in Hamirpur and 20.13 mcm in Mahoba will be available for households,” the minister added. Though forest clearance of the Daudhan reservoir of the project is still awaited, the Centre will soon create a special purpose vehicle – Ken-Betwa Link Project Authority – for implementation of the project in eight years. The project is likely to impact the Panna Tiger reserve in MP, around 4,000 hectare of which is expected to be submerged once the Daudhan Dam is constructed over the Ken River.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-mp-ink-ken-betwa-pactto-drench-parched-bkhand/articleshow/81640148.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Breathless +ves land at government hospitals OPDs, no beds for them||NAGPUR: As the Covid bed availability scenario is becoming grimmer by the day in city, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Monday morning decided to implement a slew of measures to ensure citizens do not face any problem in finding bed for critical patients, especially in private hospitals. Yet, in a late night development, the situation seemed to worsen to such an extent that breathless patients landed at the Covid OPDs of medical colleges after they couldn’t find a bed in several private hospitals. Medical colleges too told them that beds were not available. Earlier in the day, the NMC has directed private hospitals to start triaging Covid patients and immediately refer all step-down ones and stable cases to Covid Care Centre (CCC) or in home isolation. The civic body had on Monday morning decided to follow up admission of all people, who call up its helpline seeking beds, and more private hospitals will be asked to start Covid treatment. However, by around 11pm, the helpline officials said there were no beds available in the city. Earlier, as the Covid caseload is gradually shifting from private to public hospitals, both the tertiary medical colleges were asked to increase functional beds. Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) would be shifting its vaccination centre to pave way for 40 high dependency unit (HDU) beds at Ward 49, while Indira Gandhi Government Medical College & Hospital (IGGMCH) will be getting manpower to run as many beds. Both the medical colleges are grappling with shortage of doctors and nurses as many in-house staffers have tested Covid positive. The NMC is also recalling doctors and nurses who were recruited during the August-September Covid wave. The medical colleges too started shifting step-down patients to MLA Hostel CCC, which was re-started on Monday. Another 78 oxygenated beds will be run at Pachpaoli CCC, where staff training has commenced. The NMC has also asked Shalinitai Meghe Hospital and Research Centre (SMHRC) to restart 300 beds. This time, the hospital would function as Dedicated Covid Hospital (DCH). Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said civic chief Radhakrishnan B held a review meeting in the morning. “The civic chief has asked GMCH and IGGMCH to start more Covid beds. We have also asked railway hospitals to start Covid treatment or provide their staff for Ayush Hosptial at Sadar,” he said. Additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma said around 500 Covid beds were available as on Monday morning in private DCHs. “We have increased the number of hospitals and would be asking even smaller establishments to admit Covid patients. Our helpline is running and staff will follow-up callers till the patients get admitted. Our dashboard too displays updates of bed availability and we are trying to make it zone-wise so that people know which hospital is available in their area,” he said. Sharma advised citizens not to ask for specific hospitals as beds may not be available there. Civic officials have observed that people seek information about bed availability at specific hospital and this is causing an impression of bed shortage. Sharma also said that the city has 905 ICU beds in private hospitals. “Let the doctor or hospital decide what type of care a patient needs. Relatives themselves are deciding that their patient needs ICU,” he said. Regarding triaging, Sharma said, “Each bed is a scare resource now and hospitals have been strictly told to ensure beds are not unnecessarily occupied by mild patients, who can be treated at step-down facilities. This will ease pressure on tertiary hospitals.” Since last week, citizens are unable to get a bed in Covid hospitals easily as they are said to be running full following the surge in daily cases. On Monday morning, NGO TogetherWeCan received a couple of distress calls from citizens whose entire family has tested positive and some of them needed hospitalization. Some positive persons even ventured out in search of beds as NMC helpline didn’t respond, said a representative from the NGO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/breathless-ves-land-at-govt-hosp-opds-no-beds-for-them/articleshow/81638564.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Chennai||Different strokes of creative flow||By Gowri RamnarayanCHENNAI: Can you see the world through two different lenses? That’s what these three Carnatic vocalists do when they sing and paint by turns. Colours and music have a common factor, feels Bengaluru-based Aishwarya Vidhya Raghunath, trained in the fastidious Veena Dhanammal School of music. "I think of every raga as a different colour — Kalyani is rust, Sahana is peach, Todi is blue," she says with a laugh. Aishwarya got introduced to water colours and crayons in school, and continued to attend art camps and workshops to gain more exposure and knowledge. Chennai’s Subhiksha Rangarajan started by sketching and doodling all over the place as children often do. Inspired by her mother Lakshmi, who is a painter and musician, she grew up with paints, brushes and the tanpura. Taking up fine arts in college, Subhiksha was thrilled "to learn the history and philosophy of art, draw and paint live models." Though she shifted gears, pursuing media management studies and another masters course in jazz performance in Toronto, she continued to paint and began adventuring into graphic design. She has made a name as a freelance graphic designer with logos, portfolios, apps, websites, and as an illustrator for books and animation films. "I take up projects which interest me, but nothing time-consuming, because I prioritise music — Carnatic as well as Independent music that I sing and compose," she explains. She has scored music for two Tamil films (to be released) and for "Kanya", winner of Best Sound Design, Berlin International Short Film Festival 2020. Growing up in Delhi, Savita Narasimhan’s Carnatic music lessons began in childhood. So did her love of paint and brush. In school, her art teacher stimulated her interest in colours and textures. "She not only taught us about depth, perspective, light and techniques, but took us on field trips to watch crafts people paint on different surfaces, sketching with soot from an oil lamp, mixing tree sap and resin to make colours, crushing beetroot to obtain a rich purple," Savita recalls. Her love of the folk arts is obvious in her wall murals, whether of trees or the pastoral Krishna legend. Folk motifs and organic material proliferate on the products she creates under the label Rangalekha. All three see themselves as musicians first. However, they continue to be commissioned to draw, paint and design. For Aishwarya this began with her passion for birding and photography. "I go to the Nilgiris, Coorg or Sikkim to photograph birds. You can’t get the texture of the feathers and feel of their bodies in a photograph. So I paint them. The grandala’s blue, the flamingo’s pink, the oriole’s gold — not easy to get them right!" Soon, Aishwarya was commissioned by Artists for Wildlife and Nature to do a series of bird paintings on wood. A participant in four group exhibitions, she says, "A solo exhibition needs many works, all so unique that they create a niche. I’m getting there, but now, my goal as a painter is to explore different surfaces, capture the riot of colours in nature, create a fraternity of artists working to conserve Nature," she laughs. Does music inspire their visual expression? "Absolutely!" Aishwarya exclaims. Last year when the pandemic raged, Aishwarya decided to create her own pool of harmony during Navaratri, with an audio-visual concert. Every kriti she sang on the mother goddess was accompanied by a painting of the images invoked by that song. Subhiksha’s series inspired by Muttuswami Dikshitar’s compositions (, delete comma) was a whole new experience for her as she sang those very compositions in the gallery where they were displayed. Another music-inspired painting project was for the performing arts magazine Sruti - a cartoon series of musicians. "The most special challenge for me was to paint large abstract images of earth, water, fire, sky and ether, to be displayed in the theatre production "Fire and Ash"," says Savita. The greater challenge was to match her singing in the same show, to the spirit of the five elements she had invoked on the canvas. For all of them both artforms are a source of happiness for them. But each demands their creative ideas to be channelled in different ways. Subhiksha explains, "I relate to music as something I was rigorously taught. Art I learned pretty much on my own. With music I feel responsible to listeners, I feel the need to convey who I am with what I sing. Art is different, I make bold, experimental choices, nothing binds me." Aishwarya’s take? "In art I know what’s happening, I can pause, reflect, correct, change, I am more relaxed, more in control of my medium. But music is always in the present. I’m more lost when I’m singing. I go with the flow and feeling, I don’t think or reflect so much." Savita’s voice softens to spell out her thoughts, "Painting and singing — different processes to express different perspectives. In my work, one may have a subliminal impact on the other. However, in Carnatic music, whether in singing or listening, my brain is constantly active. I am preoccupied with the grammar of the genre. Painting is to sense an extreme, meditative peace. I love that silence in creativity."

The father, Uttam Chaugule, told people in his village, Banpuri in Aatpadi taluka, that his daughter, Tai, had died of a cardiac arrest. He conducted her last rites hours after her death and later buried her half-burnt body. Aatpadi assistant police inspector Rohit Gabale told TOI that Chaugule has been arrested under sections 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code. Gabale said Tai was studying in class 12 in a local college. Chaugule wanted to fix her marriage with a armyman from Pandharpur in Solapur district. He had called the man and his family to his house for negotiations on March 14. A day before the family could come, Chaugule and his daughter quarrelled over the marriage proposal with her insisting that she be allowed to continue her education. Chaugule thrashed her and hit her on the head with an agricultural tool. Tai suffered serious head injuries and died minutes later. Investigations have revealed that Chaugule hurriedly conducted Tai’s last rites; people who came for the funeral did not believe Chaugule’s version that Tai had died of a cardiac arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/girl-prefers-studies-to-marriage-dad-kills-her/articleshow/81639444.cms||---

---||Delhi||City cops failed to identify trafficking as common reason for missing kids: Panel||New Delhi: The parliamentary panel on home affairs in its report takes “strong note” that Delhi Police in its submissions before the committee has not identified “trafficking” as a common reason for missing children even though the ministry’s advisory makes it clear that in every case of a missing child there will be an initial presumption of either abduction or trafficking. In the meeting of the parliamentary standing committee held on November 18 last year, Delhi Police informed the Committee that the common reasons for missing children as identified by them are “lost the way, academic pressure, scolding by parents, elopement, runaway, left on their own will, family circumstances, etc.” “Surprisingly, trafficking was not mentioned as a common reason for missing children,” it is noted by the committee in its report on atrocities and crimes against women and children tabled in Parliament last week. The committee chaired by Congress MP Anand Sharma “believes that trafficking of children is an alarming issue”. The committee observes that they are “aghast to note the sorry state of affairs in the NCT of Delhi so far as missing children is concerned”. The panel goes on to cite numbers to emphasise the point. NCRB data shows 15,252, 14,896 and 12,239 children went missing in Delhi in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. “Despite the fact that an advisory has been issued by the MHA to State Governments/ UT Administrations that in case of every missing child reported; there will be an initial presumption of either abduction or trafficking, unless, in the investigation, the same is proved otherwise”, the Delhi Police has not even cited “trafficking as a reason for missing children in their submission,” it is observed by the committee. According to data upto October 31 last year on missing (2,943) and traced children (2,210), the recovery rate of missing children by Delhi Police has been 68%, 80% and 75% for missing children up to 8 years of age, 8-12 years of age and 12-18 years of age respectively. The NCRB data on crimes against women and children indicates that 1,253 cases of rape, 2,355 cases of molestation and 3,672 cases of kidnapping and abduction of women, 1,736 cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act), 56 cases of trafficking of children (under 370 & 370A) and 5,527 cases of kidnapping and abduction of children (under section 363 IPC) have been reported in Delhi in the year 2019 itself. The committee also recommends that the ministry of home affairs in coordination with the three bordering states and Delhi Police should establish a permanent coordination mechanism that will help in effective tracking, monitoring and prevention of crimes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-cops-failed-to-identify-trafficking-as-common-reason-for-missing-kids-panel/articleshow/81640198.cms||Ambika Pandit

Basit Ali Khan, who is supervising the bed-situation within municipal limits of Aurangabad, on Monday said almost all beds are currently occupied in most of the state-run and private hospitals. “Despite increasing the number of beds reserved for Covid patients, there is dearth of ICU and oxygen beds at our hospital. We and other private hospitals have prepared a waiting list for needy patients to accommodate them depending on their comorbid conditions and severity of infection,” said Dr Anant Pandhare, the medical director at Hedgewar hospital. As per official data, different CCCs and DCHCs in Aurangabad district have 3,341 oxygen beds, 425 ICU beds and 300 ventilator beds. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan said: “I would like to appeal to citizens to go for early testing in case they have any Covid-like symptom. We are coming across many cases where patients take over-the-counter medicine or approach local doctors. They come for the tests only when their condition deteriorates.” On Monday, the district administration announced helpline numbers — 9326789007, 8830061846, 8855876654 and 9420703008 (rural). The district had reported over 1,100 daily cases for the eighth consecutive day on Sunday, taking total number of active cases to 11,069.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Three accused in separate cases plead guilty, seek leniency||MUMBAI: In three cases, citing repentance, poverty and lengthy incarceration as undertrials, three accused pleaded guilty and prayed for lenient sentences. When accused persons plead guilty, they forfeit their right to a trial. While two accused pleaded guilty under separate Pocso Act cases, where they were booked for sexually assaulting minors, in the third case, a 32-year-old labourer, Jakir Shaikh, was convicted of illegally selling painkillers in 2017. Shaikh and one of the accused, under the Pocso Act, have now been sentenced to the time they have already spent in prison — 4 years 2 months and 2 years respectively. The third accused Devidas More (31), who sexually assaulted a 16-year-old girl at Vile Parle station in December 2019, was sentenced to three years imprisonment. In each case the accused told the respective trial court judges that they were pleading guilty voluntarily. More had first sent his request to the special Pocso Act court to plead guilty through jail authorities. He claimed that he was from Nanded, had arrived in the city to make a living and was now a “scapegoat of circumstances”. He was then produced before the court where the charges and maximum sentences were explained to him by the judge and his lawyer provided through legal aid. More insisted that he wanted to plead guilty. Seeking leniency, More submitted that he was poor and unable to pay any exorbitant fine. He also said that he had realised “everything” and wanted to live a respectable life.

A growing number of peafowls is flocking to neighbourhoods in the city, which environmentalists say is a sign of a crisis — birds losing their natural habitat of streams in forests. Residents who are used to sighting peafowls in their area, report a definite increase over the past few days. On Monday morning, many residents of Thudiyalur and Kavundampalayam were surprised to peafowls perched on their compound walls and those who visited their terrace could see a group of them resting in the vicinity. The presence of the birds on World Water Day, serves as a reminder to conserve natural resources, felt experts. The theme this year is "valuing water", where the cost of water is much more than its price. "We need to preserve our freshwater tanks like Puttu Vikki in Perur, Vedapatti tank and Kolarampathy and ensure it does not also get polluted with sewage and industrial waste because it will lead to birds giving them a miss," says environmentalist Mohan Raj. "Only if we preserve our streams and rivers can our forests survive, which will retain many wild birds like pea fowls’ habitats," he says. Peafowls are usually found in forests or agricultural land, where irrigation takes place and they can eat berries, vegetables and bananas. "They have been visiting urban parts of Coimbatore for decades now. However, their population seems to have increased," says P R Selvaraj of Coimbatore Nature Society. "As more waterways are being concretised, wetlands are decreasing and forests reducing, their population in the city has grown," he says.

Justice M Nirmal Kumar dismissed the bail pleas of sub-inspector of police Raghu Ganesh, head constables Thomas Francis, S Murugan and constable Muthuraj. Jeyaraj’s wife Selvarani who filed an intervening petition objected to the grant of bail to the petitioners citing that there is all possibility of tampering with the witnesses. Their earlier bail petitions were dismissed by the court as there was prima facie materials to show that they were involved in the custodial torture of father-son duo. The CBI, which had taken over the investigation had filed a final report against nine accused cops in connection with the custodial deaths.

---||Amritsar||Luxmi Kanta Chawla-Arvind Kejriwal meeting triggers speculation||AMRITSAR: A meeting between BJP firebrand veteran Luxmi Kanta Chawla and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal has raised eyebrows and sparked speculation of the leader shaking hands with AAP — if not a pressure tactic for the post of governor. The AAP leadership claims that both leaders had a chance meeting, though it took place at the Circuit House over breakfast on Sunday. The BJP leadership has however taken the meeting as a “serious” one and has begun an internal inquiry to know the context of the meeting. The meeting assumes significance as it comes with AAP kickstarting its election campaign with Kisan Sammelan at Baghapurana in Moga, and Chawla going against the BJP’s party line by throwing her weight behind the ongoing farmers’ agitation. A photo of Punjab former health minister Chawla, her husband Sukhraj Bal, Kejriwal, and AAP MLA Baljinder Kaur has been doing the rounds on social media and it is believed to have been clicked by a security guard of Chawla. A source in BJP said Chawla had been seeking for the post of governor for long, but the party’s central leadership had ignored her so far. The source said the meeting with Kejriwal could be a tactic to pressure the BJP ahead of assembly elections in the state, especially when the party had lost support of its oldest alliance partner SAD. Both AAP and BJP leaders here claimed that Chawla had come to Circuit House for a walk on its lush lawns. When she came to know about Kejriwal, she went to meet him. Despite repeated attempts, Chawla didn’t pick the phone to comment on her meeting with Kejriwal and rumours of her joining AAP. AAP spokesperson Gurbhjej Singh confirmed that the meeting took place between two leaders at Circuit House. “It was a chance meeting held in a cordial atmosphere wherein two leaders discussed the issues of Punjab,” he said. When asked whether Chawla could join AAP, Gurbhej, evading a direct reply, said, “People from all walks of life with positive ideologies and having a passion for the betterment of Punjab are welcome to join the party.” BJP general secretary Jeevan Gupta, who is also in charge of Majha zone, said, “Chawla is in the party and will remain in the party. We still need to know in which context she met Kejriwal. We are political people and there could be several issues for a meeting,” he said, adding that there was no truth in talk of Chawla leaving the party. Sources in AAP informed that an AAP MLA and its central observers who have been camping in Amritsar are playing a critical role in roping in Chawla and have furthered efforts after the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/bjp-ex-minister-chawla-meets-kejriwal-sparks-rumours/articleshow/81639464.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Delhi||Migrants remember year of tears and toil||New Delhi: Rukmani Devi from Chhattisgarh had Rs 4,000 when the lockdown was announced a year ago. That money lasted two months. In May, she had no option but to pack her bag and walk to her village. It took her 10 days to reach home, all the while thinking she would find some dignity there. To her dismay, the people refused to let her enter the village. “Since there were no Covid cases there, the villagers were afraid of me being a carrier since I was coming from Delhi,” she recalled. “It took an entire day to convince my neighbours to let me go to my house. Eventually, I realised my condition in the village was worse than in Delhi, so I returned.”Devi could not get work as a household help even after months of trying. “It was much later that I got a job at a construction site at half the wages I earned as a domestic help,” she said. Like her, many have faced a bad, if not worse, situation after the lockdown. Remembering the humiliations they suffered during the nationwide shutdown a year ago, hundreds of migrant workers gathered at Jantar Mantar on Tuesday for a candlelight march. Organised by Working People's Charter, the gathering was a cauldron of the bitter memories the workers had of the challenging months. “2020 will go down in world history as the most difficult year in recent times,” declared Kamal, a migrant labourer. An organiser of the event said that March 24, 2020, would be remembered not only for marking the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdown, but also for ushering in an unprecedented impact on the country’s 140 million migrant labour force. “Perhaps the most heart wrenching and shameful news was of 16 workers being killed by a train near Aurangabad on the way to their village,” said Chandan Kumar of Working People’s Charter. “The point that India’s migrant workers had to bear the severest brunt of the lockdowns needs no belabouring. Neither does the fact that the migrant crisis unfolded due to India’s longstanding and unaddressed labour problems.” Kumar added that urban employment guarantee, wage support, strong grievance redressal mechanisms, better facilitation of social security and entitlements and importantly, a long-term regulation of worksites, needed to be focused on in the government’s larger vision of a policy for migrant workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/migrants-remember-year-of-tears-and-toil/articleshow/81658443.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Kolkata||Illegal coal-mining accused moves special CBI court||Kolkata: Vinay Mishra, one of the accused in the illegal coal mining scam, has moved the special CBI court with an appeal to quash the FIR against him. The matter was listed for hearing on March 17 before Calcutta High Court justice, Jay Sengupta. The CBI lawyer asked the petitioner to serve a copy to them. It was supposed to be heard on Monday, but the hearing was adjourned. The matter will be heard next on March 31. Mishra has also moved the court with the anticipatory bail plea. Enforcement Directorate arrested Vikas Mishra, brother of Vinay, last Tuesday and alleged that they had stashed away nearly Rs 730 crore. The investigators, looking into the money laundering aspect of the illegal coal mining in Bengal, claimed that the Mishra brothers used to work hand in glove with the prime accused, Anup Majee. According to ED sources, based on the evidence gathered so far, the investigators feel that Majee had allegedly mopped up Rs 1,300 crore from the illegal mining. A major chunk of the money was allegedly given to the Mishra brothers. The CBI on Monday summoned Amit Agarwal in connection with the illegal coal mining scam, but he did not appear. The agency had earlier summoned Agarwal, a businessman close to Anup Majee alias Lala, the prime accused in the illegal coal mining case. Meanwhile, the CBI on Monday conducted searches at the offices and residences of three officials of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in Mumbai in connection with the Saradha Ponzi muddle. Sources said that the agency is conducting searches at six locations linked with the officials at the rank of chief general manager (CGM) and general manager (GM). The Saradha Group was busted in April 2013 after it defaulted on repayments to depositors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/illegal-coal-mining-accused-moves-special-cbi-court/articleshow/81638658.cms||---

The board said the final and revised time-tables for exams are on its website. Earlier, it had declared an increase in time for theory papers and change in time-table for practical and oral exams, which will be held after written exams this year. Maharashtra State Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary Education secretary Ashok Bhosale issued the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for written and practical exams on Sunday. Bhosale said if any student had Covid, he/she will be given 15 days’ grace to submit practical assignments in their schools/colleges. Students visiting schools must follow government precautions. “Schools have been told to make arrangements for drinking water and sanitisation. But students are advised to carry their own water bottles and sanitisers.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow doctor catches infection after second vax dose||LUCKNOW: A Lucknow doctor became the first person in Uttar Pradesh to test positive for the novel coronavirus infection with symptoms even after completing the two-dose course of the vaccine given a month apart, reports Vivek Singh Chauhan. Dr Nitin Mishra, emergency medical officer at SPM Civil hospital, Lucknow, had received two shots of Covaxin on February 15 and March 16 respectively. “However, I developed a severe cough along with mild fever on March 18 and got myself tested two days after on Saturday (March 20). The report on Sunday revealed I was Covid-19 positive,” the doctor told TOI.“He has isolated himself at home because he has only mild symptoms and regularly monitors his blood pressure and blood oxygen levels. We are also in touch with him and in case symptoms aggravate, he will be hospitalised,” said director, SPM Hospital, Dr Subhash Chandra Sundariyal. “The entire hospital was sanitised on Sunday and services are continuing as usual,” he added.UP director general of medical health Dr DS Negi confirmed that Dr Nitin’s case is the first recorded instance where a person has been found to have contracted Covid-19 and turned symptomatic after completion of the two-dose course of Covaxin.Covaxin has been indigenously developed in India by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research. Experts said that there was no need to panic at all or raise any doubts over the efficacy of the vaccine as antibodies against the virus develop between 2 to 4 weeks depending on the response of the immune system of an individual after getting the first dose. The second does act as a booster, which further strengthens the immune response. In some cases, full immunity might come one or two weeks after the second dose. In this case, they said, there could be a possibility that the doctor got infected before taking the second dose, but symptoms surfaced a few days later. Generally, symptoms surface five days after catching infection, they added. Dr Negi said “Data shows that the efficacy of Covaxin is about 80-90%. The vaccine does not act as a shield against infection, but protects a person from falling critically ill, hence people should go for the vaccine, if they are medically eligible, without any hesitation.” Prof Amita Jain, head microbiology, King George's Medical University, said “It takes a few weeks, even after completion of the vaccination course, to build full immunity against the disease. During this period, a person may get infected and develop symptoms.” “In fact, even after developing full immunity post vaccination, in a few cases, a person can catch infection, but he/she generally remains asymptomatic. In rare cases, he/she may also have mild symptoms, but the vaccine will prevent critical illness and thus saves life,” she added. Prof Jain emphasised that a vaccinated person after acquiring infection can also pass on to others, hence it is very important for all of us to follow safety protocols all the time. Former head, microbiology department, Institute of Medical Science, Banaras Hindu University, Prof Anil Kumar Gulati, said, "In rarest of rare cases, it has also been seen that immune response doesn't trigger even after completing full vaccination course. As a result, antibodies are not generated at all. Such persons remain susceptible to catching infection.” Chief medical officer, Lucknow, Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar also said, "The case is a reminder that even after getting vaccinated, people need to take precautions to protect themselves from catching infection and the possibility of passing it to others.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-doc-catches-infection-after-second-vax-dose/articleshow/81640201.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Logically, there is no question of anyone going to the fuel station to refuel his/her vehicle.”The fuel dealers have also been asked to strictly enforce the ‘No Mask No Fuel’ rule at all the outlets. Those violating the norm will face action, warned the authorities.In the communication, jointly signed by Gupta and Chavan, those involved in providing health services, media, essentials like milk and food items, LPG and fuel suppliers, transport services including autorickshaws, construction and industry workers and employees of bank, postal and related services have been given an exemption.Meanwhile, fuel dealers, citing the high cost of operations, are seeking permission to shut down their fuel stations during the curfew hours. Aurangabad Petrol Dealers Association’s Aqil Abbas said, “There is barely any sale during the curfew hours. The operation costs, including manpower and other recurring expenses, are high. Due to poor sales, things become economically unfeasible.”He suggested that arrangements can be made by asking only select fuel stations to operate during the curfew hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/fuel-sold-only-to-emergency-service-vehicles-during-curfew/articleshow/81636916.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Delhi: Cour-age! 106-year-old woman undergoes hip replacement surgery||NEW DELHI: A 106-year-old woman, Shanti Devi, underwent successful hip replacement surgery at a city private hospital recently. Devi, a resident of Bulandshahar in Uttar Pradesh, suffered a fracture of the hip joint, following which she was rushed to Dharmshila Narayana Hospital on March 12, a doctor said. “Without the surgery, she would have been bedridden. Most patients in her age can’t survive for a long time if their mobility is affected. That’s why we had to take up the surgery,” said, Dr Monu Singh, senior consultant in orthopaedics at the hospital. “The surgery, which was conducted on March 15, was regular one, but we had to do it fast and with utmost care due to her age. We couldn’t afford much blood loss either,” Dr Singh said. Due to weakening of the bone with advancing age, the hip joint breaks with even trivial injury or force. These patients are then rendered immobile and confined to bed, which in turn increases the risk of lung infection, urinary tract infection, clotting in leg veins. Many a times, it even results in loss of life, the doctor explained. The surgery, he said, involved replacement of the hip with an artificial joint, so that they could be made to stand and able to move independently. “The patient is doing fine now. She is able to stand on her own,” said another doctor. With advancement in medical facilities and better lifestyle, longevity has improved. And, surgery among the centenarians, which was once considered avoidable, has picked up, said the doctor. “My mother is old but is full of life. When she fractured her hip, we wanted to explore all possible options to get her operated. We weren’t bothered about her frailty or if the procedure was necessary at her age,” said Ritu Singh, Devi’s daughter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cour-age-106-year-old-woman-undergoes-hip-replacement-surgery/articleshow/81658462.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Another arrest in interfaith marriage violence as couple goes into hiding||NEW DELHI: A fifth member of the mob that caused mayhem after an interfaith marriage at Harijan Basti in Sarai Kale Khan on Saturday has been arrested. The couple in question, however, has been changing their location for their safety. The boy’s family has returned to their house even as police and paramilitary forces remain deployed in the area to quell any disturbance. The two decided to get married after the girl’s family got her engaged to another man on March 20.  The youth’s family had approached the girl’s in December last year after her parents got to know about the affair.  When they refused to relent and accept the relationship, the couple decided to get married without their blessings. On March 17, the couple did a court marriage and then appeared in front of police informing them that they had got married willingly. DCP (Southeast) RP Meena said, “We arrested Mohammad Ali (25) on Monday. Earlier, we had arrested Farman, Sharukh, Hasan and Raja. The mob had damaged 20-30 vehicles. We are checking more CCTV footage to ascertain the number of people involved in the violence.” The youth’s sister told TOI that he was the only son among three siblings. “We don’t want to lose him. When he told us about the relationship and willingness to get married, we were hesitant. They had been in a relationship for around two and a half years. The girl’s parents got to know of it in December. My father went to the girl’s house to tell her family that the two were in love and they should peacefully get them married. After the girl was abused and hit by her family members, she hid behind my father and told him she would only get married to my brother,” she added. “We were scared for him as the girl’s family had threatened them both. We left for a wedding at our uncle’s house. In the meantime, my brother and she got married in court. Both then approached police after which the families were called. Later, a mob gathered and it became difficult for them to even walk out of the police station. They left with the help of the cops and went to a relative’s house. But after people got to know their location, they shifted to another place,” said the boy’s sister. The boy’s father said, “We are glad we were not at home when the mob struck, else we would have been killed. We ourselves took my son and the girl to the police station. The mob damaged so many vehicles and used religious slur at us. Who will compensate for the loss? We hope they don’t harm any of our family members.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/another-arrest-in-interfaith-marriage-violence-as-couple-goes-into-hiding/articleshow/81640207.cms||---

---||Madurai||Plea: Coral reefs can protect islands in Gulf of Mannar||Madurai: The Madras high court on Monday sought a response from the Centre and state on a plea to prevent the islands situated in the Gulf of Mannar region from submerging by protecting the coral reefs.A division bench of justices M M Sundresh and S Ananthi was hearing a public interest litigation filed by R Manibharathi, a law graduate from Madurai district.The petitioner stated that there are 21 islands situated within the Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve. As per experts, these islands would get submerged under water in the near future. He stated the area of Vaan Island which was 26.5 acres in 1973 has reduced. The reasons for submergence of these islands were due to various factors such as rising sea levels due to climate change, unsustainable fishing practices and coral reef mining.Trap fishing is one of the prevalent practices adopted near the coral reefs in Gulf of Mannar region. He stated that fish traps are set around the reefs thereby damaging them. He stated that the authorities who were involved in research deployed artificial coral reefs around Vaan Island. In due course, they found out the natural coral reefs have started to colonise the artificial reefs which has contributed to the increase in land cover of Vaan Island by 54.51% from 2.33 to 3.6 hectares. He stated that Vallanguchalli and Poovarasanpatti islands in the Gulf of Mannar region have already submerged. Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-coral-reefs-can-protect-islands-in-gulf-of-mannar/articleshow/81639474.cms||---

The rate of the infection’s spread can be gauged from the fact that within a week’s time, the cantonment board’s DCHC is almost full. On the first day of the DCHC restarting, there were only six patients admitted to the facility. In a bid to cater to the treatment of non-Covid patients, an out-patient department (OPD) has been started in a vacant CBD school. Non-Covid patients who need hospitalisation are being referred to NMC’s Bytco hospital or the Nashik civil hospital.Ajay Kumar said the CBD constantly sends a Covid report to the district administration. If required, the district administration will instruct the CBD to set up another Covid facility. A CBD-run school may then be used for the purpose. The manpower and other equipment for the covid facility would be provided by the district administration. The cantonment hospital was first converted into a DCHC in May 2020. It continued to function as a DCHC until the first week of February as the number of Covid cases in the Deolali Camp area and its surroundings had dropped. However, after the recent surge, the CBD hospital has been reconverted. A large number of patients from the surrounding villages also come to the cantonment board hospital for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/deolali-cantt-covid-centre-nearly-full/articleshow/81636930.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The facility, which was closed in January, will help the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) meet the increased demand for beds, including those supported by oxygen. As on Monday, 572 beds reserved for Covid-19 were available in various hospitals in areas under the PMC’s jurisdiction. These beds included those with oxygen and ventilator support. The jumbo facility has a capacity of 800 beds. “There is no shortage of beds for Covid treatment. We have opened the CoEP facility as a back-up arrangement,” said Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol, who visited the jumbo facility for a review. “The PMC has planned to start the facility in phases. The first phase will have 250 beds by Tuesday,” said Rajendra Muthe, a senior PMC official. The PMC has carried out a structural audit of the facility to ensure its resumption. An official said the PMC’s standing committee has approved Rs7.5 crore for reopening the facility. The funds would be used for infrastructure and manpower management. The jumbo facility on the CoEP grounds was closed on January 15. An overall decline in the positive cases in December 2020 and January 2021 had reduced the number of patients at the facility. The structure was, however, kept as it was as “a backup arrangement” to tide over any surge in Covid-19 cases, “The PMC had decided to close the facility on a temporary basis. The aim was to reduce the expenses for infrastructure and manpower to run the facility,” a senior official of the civic body said. The daily Covid-19 cases dropped to 4,321 in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) on Monday, though its test count continued to stay above 21,000. On Sunday, as many as 5,408 people had tested Covid positive in the region. The PMC had also set up another jumbo Covid hospital in Baner with corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. This facility has around 350 beds. “This is a concrete structure and will not be started immediately. It can be made operational in a couple of days if the demand for hospitalization of patients increases. The manpower and other facilities for the centre are in place," the official said. The official added that a committee has been set up to dump material present at the jumbo hospitals. The committee will distribute medical equipment and other items among hospitals run by the civic body and the district administration once the jumbo facilities are completely closed. Last week, Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil had said they were also exploring the option to reactivate the jumbo facility soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-restarts-jumbo-hospital-on-coep-grounds/articleshow/81638682.cms||---

The study, released on World Water Day, demonstrates a grim picture of groundwater depletion in the state. It shows that the highest groundwater drop in Bengal since 2013 has been up to 11m, mostly in the central zone or the “rice bowl of Bengal”, which is Burdwan district. There has also been a decline of groundwater level in Kolkata from 7m to 20m in the last 12 years. Says Vinay Jaju of SwitchON Foundation, “Due to the absence of technologies to harvest rainwater, the state is struggling to meet the aspirations of its farmers and the time has come for taking a critical look at the deteriorating resource”. To tackle this situation, the not-for-profit organization is partnering with various academic institutions, like IITs, with a plan to undertake rainwater harvesting in Kolkata and groundwater recharge in four districts of Bengal. Part of the agenda is to spread awareness among farmers and citizens to save water. “In recent years, farmers and cities have started facing water stress, which has resulted in heightened distress,” says Parul Thapa of SwitchON Foundation. SwitchON has launched their flagship Stren-gthening Energy Water Agriculture (SEWA) programme to promote clean energy in agriculture, doubling farmers’ income and conserving water resources. With aggressive use of groundwater, the second green revolution is also being promoted in east India. “The consequences will lead to wells going dry, groundwater contamination emerging more strongly than what we have now, competition and conflict over groundwater, along with groundwater depletion,” said Himanshu Kulkarni, executive director of Advanced Centre for Water Resources Development and Management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/study-finds-signs-of-groundwater-dip/articleshow/81638695.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The over 12-lakh Army lost 591 soldiers to suicide since 2014, while the number was 160 in IAF and 36 in Navy, said minister of state for defence Shripad Naik, in a written reply in Rajya Sabha on Monday. The defence establishment has taken some stress management measures but clearly much more needs to be done, with around 100 uniformed personnel taking their lives every year for decades now, as reported by TOI earlier. Protracted deployment along the borders with Pakistan and China as well as counter-insurgency operations do take a toll on the mental health and physical endurance of soldiers. Soldiers posted in far-flung areas also undergo tremendous stress for not being able to take care of the problems facing their families back home, which could range from financial and marital problems to property disputes and harassment by anti-social elements. In his reply, Naik said the government has taken “several steps towards stress amelioration amongst troops”. These include deployment of trained psychological counsellors, improvement in the quality of food and clothing for soldiers, training in stress management, provision of recreational facilities, ‘buddy system’, leave concessions, facilities for movement of troops from border areas and establishing a grievance mechanism in states. “The issue of stress and strain is being addressed by the commanders in a comprehensive manner at various levels,” said Naik. Specific measures have been put in place as part of the multi-pronged strategy in the Army, which include stress management sessions, psychiatric counselling and sensitisation of commanders on the subject, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/800-defence-personnel-died-by-suicide-in-last-7-years-govt/articleshow/81642042.cms||---

---||Nagpur||2-day-old with rare heart problem saved after 6-hour operation||NAGPUR: A 2-day-old baby was saved from a rare genetic critical heart disease called Transposition of Great Arteries (TGA) in city last week. The newborn was discharged on Monday and is doing well, informed doctors at New Era Hospital. “The neonate was suffering from TGA, for which prompt surgery was necessary. Mortality of such heart disease is 100%, if not operated,” said Dr Anand Sancheti, director of New Era Hospital and well-known cardiovascular surgeon. In a normal heart, great arteries — aorta (pure blood) and pulmonary artery (impure blood) — supply oxygen-rich blood to body and lungs, respectively. TGA is a condition in which impure blood is circulated in the body and pure blood is circulated in lungs, due to abnormal orientation of the great arteries. This disease is rare in India and one in 3,500 live births in the US have this type of complication. If not screened early, babies die within 12 hours. Surgery must be performed as soon as possible, before baby gets decompensated. Neonatology team of New Era Hospital performed the surgery successfully. Such open heart surgery in neonates takes around 6-8 hours with high chances of on-table death. Dr Sandeep Khanzode, renowned paediatric cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr Anand Sancheti and their team with anaesthetist Dr Sahil Bansal and Dr Sneha Khade performed the surgery. Post-operation, this neonate was managed by neonatologist Dr Swapnil Bhisikar, paediatric cardiologist Dr Manish Chokhandre and team. “The baby was critical and was on ventilator support for thee days, but expert and appropriate treatment as per international standards brought a favourable outcome,” said Dr Bhisikar, adding every neonate should be screened for congenital heart diseases. Parents of the newborn expressed gratefulness to the entire team of New Era Hospital led by directors Dr Anand Sancheti, Dr Nilesh Agrawal and Dr Nidheesh Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-day-old-with-rare-heart-problem-saved-after-6-hour-operation/articleshow/81639479.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Madurai is one among 122 cities in the country to be shortlisted in 2019 under the central government’s National Clean Air Programme.The cities were determined in taking the 2017 pollution level as baseline. Data available with the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) shows that the average particulate matter 10 for the year 2017 in the city was 67.1 and the average particulate matter 2.5 in the same year was 25.4.Madurai Corporation has chosen road dust, public transport, traffic congestion and construction activities as the four major areas on improving the air quality.A proposal seeking Rs 415 crore was submitted along with an action plan to bring down the pollution levels in the next five years. It had proposed to bring down particulate matter 10 by 70% and particulate matter 2.5 by 65% by the year 2025. A corporation official said they are in the process of forming committees comprising officials from various departments from corporation, highways, pollution control board and district administration. The committees will be finalized in a few days and meetings would be held to finalise each department’s responsibilities. He said they are confident of bringing down the pollution levels with the help of proposed plans which include increasing green cover and open space reserves in residential areas. The problem of dust on roads arise as sand accumulated on the roadside enter the centre. This occurs due because the roadside’s surface level is higher than the road’s surface level.“There is a proposal to cover the roadsides by laying bitumen roads. It will bring down the dust in the air. Ensuring vehicles carrying construction materials and debris will help to further bring down the pollution. There is also a proposal to increase the vegetative barriers on roadsides,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-corpn-to-work-on-citys-air-pollution-control/articleshow/81639480.cms||V Devanathan

---||Chandigarh||Centre owes Rs 12,402 crore as GST compensation to Punjab: Anurag Thakur||CHANDIGARH: The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation of Rs 12,402 crore for the period from April 2020 to January 2021 was pending to Punjab, like all other states and Union territories, Union minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur informed Lok Sabha on Monday. However, the central government has already released Rs 8,359 crore to Punjab as loan to meet the resource gap due to non-release of compensation due to inadequate balance in the compensation fund. He said in order to meet the shortfall in GST compensation to be paid to states, the central government has borrowed Rs 1.1 lakh crore in appropriate tranches using a special window and the borrowed amount has been passed on to the states and UTs. Thakur was replying to a question put up by the Congress’s Patiala MP Preneet Kaur. “The states will be paid full GST compensation as per GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, for the transition period by extending the levy of compensation cess beyond 5 years to meet the GST revenue shortfall as well as servicing the loan borrowed through special window scheme,” said the junior Union minister. The minister also said in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, the GST collection as well GST compensation cess collection declined sharply in the financial year 2020-21, due to which the compensation requirement to all states and UTs increased. Such increase in the GST compensation requirement of states and UTs could not be met from the GST compensation fund, as the amount available in the fund was not adequate, he explained. 15th Finance Commission recommendations Union minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur said the 15th Finance Commission had recommended Rs 3,442 crore to Punjab for six specific sectors — agriculture (Rs 1,966 crore), health (Rs 902 crore), Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana (Rs 230 crore), higher education (Rs 156 crore), judiciary (Rs 145 crore) and statistics (Rs 43 crore). He said the central government would give due consideration to sectors identified by the commission while formulating and implementing existing and new Centre-sponsored and central sector schemes. The finance panel has also recommended Rs 1,545 crore as state specific grants to Punjab during the award period (FY 2021-2026) and keeping in view the untied resources with the state government and the fiscal commitments of the central government, the central government will give due consideration to these recommendations. The commission has recommended Rs 400 crore for remediation of pollution of Sutlej river through Budha Nala and Rs 700 crore for four new institutions of medical education and research at Mohali, Hoshiarpur, Nawanshahr and Fazilka districts. Similarly, Rs 350 crore has been recommended for reduction in pollution caused by stubble burning by crop diversification, Rs 40 crore for the pilot project for installation of 15,000 KW of rooftop solar power plants in Bathinda, Rs 13 crore for development of Patiala Fort, Rs 12 crore for Jang-e-Azadi Memorial at Kartarpur in Jalandhar district, Rs 10 crore each for development of Bathinda Fort and development of the Partition Museum at Amritsar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/centre-owes-rs-12402-crore-as-gst-compensation-to-punjab-anurag/articleshow/81639482.cms||Sanjeev Verma

They also want caregivers of those with severe disabilities be given Covid shots, too. Currently, the second phase of the drive, which started on March 1, is targeted at people 60 years and above as well as those 45 years and above with comorbidities.The current circular only states that persons with disabilities (PwD) will be included in the age group of 45, but its scope is limited to only a few disabilities, instead of all the 21 disabilities specified in the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.While the Centre has already said that beneficiary groups being inoculated against Covid-19 will be extended in the coming days, activists have demanded vaccination for people with all types of disabilities.Ramchandra Rangolle, Pune-based visually challenged activist, said when the government was deciding the priority groups, they did not consider all types of disabilities. “The selection they have made under comorbidities is very limited,” he said. Rangolle said that many visually challenged people may not fit into the age group and it is time that the government includes this category under the priority group, considering the risk and overall spread in cases.Disability rights activist Anita Ghai said there should not be any age bar for vaccination for the disabled and with vaccination sites being at a distance, there is no mention of local authorities reaching out to this population. She said the government should issue directions to all centres to construct ramps and issue general accessibility information or provisions for home vaccination||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/disability-rights-activists-demand-scrapping-of-age-bar-for-vaccination/articleshow/81638730.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Bapusaheb Nagargoje, medical superintendent of NMC, said they have made the centralised bed reservation system functional so that families of patients can get in touch with the officials and beds can be made available to Covid patients.

---||Nagpur||50% patients admitted in critical state, died within 48 hours||NAGPUR: The second surge of Covid-19 cases has already surpassed the first one witnessed in September 2020 in terms of number of cases. Deaths were less as compared to the September wave which was a relief factor for Vidarbha until second week of March. But fatalities have increased significantly in the last one week. The region has reported 331 deaths between March 16 and 22. On Monday, 79 deaths were reported from all 11 districts put together, which is a record during the present surge. An analysis of deaths reported at IGGMCH Nagpur, GMCH Akola, GMCH Yavatmal and Amravati shows that about 50% of the deceased were brought in a very serious/critical condition to the hospital and died within 48 hours of admission. More than 70% of the deceased were above 65 years and almost all of them had comorbidities. Of them, 90% were known to be long term patients of hypertension, diabetes and other diseases. TOI has age/gender and hospitalization wise details of more than 300 deceased in Akola, Yavatmal, Amravati, Buldhana, Washim, Chandrapaur and IGGMCH Nagpur in last 20 days (between March 1 and 20). Yavatmal reported 53 deaths in the last seven days. Out of them, 33 were above 65 years of age. Out of the 20 deaths in Akola, 15 deceased were above 65 years. In Amravati, 20 out of the 27 deceased were above 65 years. According to doctors, many elderly patients are neglecting their health fearing hospitalization during Covid-19 times. Due to this, their immunity reduces significantly and they get infected. “Early testing and hospitalization are the key factors to avoid deaths. We have increased the number of tests significantly, but people prefer to stay in home isolation only. As per the standard guidelines, not more than 15% of total patients should be in home isolation,” said Yavatmal district collector Dr M Devendra Singh. According to Singh, vaccination of 60+ citizens should be taken up on war footing to avoid further deaths in this age group. “We have noticed that in the last two weeks the average age of deceased is above 60. Vaccination reduces the severity of disease. Every person above 60 should get vaccinated,” he said. Doctors advocated vaccination as well as early hospitalization to reduce death rate. “Vaccination must be promoted as a long-term remedy. But hospitalization at proper time is most important. Elderly patients, irrespective of severity of disease, should be kept under expert care,” said epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte. Region’s toll in last 20 days 33% | Within 24 hours of admission 20% | Within 48 hours of admission 28% | Within 3-5 days of admission 8% | After week-long stay 5.5% | Brought dead Age-wise - 28% | 70 yrs - 25% | 61-70 yrs - 27% | 51-60 yrs - 13% | 41-50 yrs - 5.5% | 31-40 yrs - 2% | Under 30 yrs Other aspects - Out of all deceased in last 20 days, 60% were men - More than 85% above 70 deceased had known comorbidities - Near 100% under-30 deceased had severe comorbidities/by birth - 75% of total deceased has known/unknown comorbid conditions||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/50-patients-admitted-in-critical-state-died-within-48-hrs/articleshow/81639495.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

In an advisory issued on Monday to all medical superintendents-cum-vice-principals of medical colleges and chief medical officers of health across the districts, has directed hospitals to organize test runs of all equipment and MGPS system to check their functional readiness. They have also been asked to check availability and supply of oxygen/cylinders. “In this respect, it may be noted that oxygen cylinders for Covid hospitals will be on same terms and conditions as have been done in the past,” said the advisory. Hospitals have also been asked to review their stocks of PPE, masks and other protective gear. Availability of all categories of manpower have also been sought to be reviewed. But the advisory mentioned that deployment order should be issued only if more cases are reported in future. Agencies for supply of diet, biomedical waste disposal, cleaning and other essential services have also been asked to be put on alert. Most Kolkata hospitals have seen a steady rise in the number of Covid patients over the last 10 days. At some private hospitals, the number has doubled. “We have seen 3-4 admissions a day since Thursday. This is significant and if the current rate continues then we may have to re-convert some non-Covid beds. We are ready to do that since the Covid set-up has not been dismantled but merely set aside,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences that had 130 Covid beds till December, now has 40.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosps-asked-to-prepare-for-spike-in-patient-flow/articleshow/81638749.cms||---

---||Madurai||Worried over rising Covid-19 cases in TN, public call to restrict election campaigns||Madurai: The uncontrolled crowd at political campaigns and meets in Madurai district, amid increasing number of Covid-19 cases, has become a cause of concern for the public. People, who gather at the political campaigns of leaders, ignore all necessary safety measures like wearing facemasks and social distancing, said P Manikandan, a social activist. DMK president M K Stalin has stressed the importance of wearing a facemask and maintaining a safe distance. “Get yourself vaccinated and do not have apprehensions about it,” Stalin exhorts in all his meets. “It would be better if he asked the people not to gather in crowds and asked them to read about his manifesto in newspapers,” said S Radha, a resident of Chokkikulam. All district administrations have announced standard operating procedures that have to be followed at public political meetings, but as of now, with just less than 15 days to go for the polls, political parties are concentrating on mobile campaigns that are drawing huge crowds. “There is no way to monitor these crowds, as almost everyone is not wearing masks and nothing can stop them from crowding round the vehicle,” officials from the administration said. “A really concerned leader should ask his cadres, who are responsible for gathering the people for these meetings and even bring people non- party members to these meetings, to refrain from sourcing the crowds in view of this dangerous disease,” said founder of Centre for Environmental Services, S V Pathy. People should be aware that the spread of the disease could lead to the postponement of the elections for which they were working, he added. “A second wave could lead to many drawbacks including having to face a bad economic downfall,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/worried-over-rising-covid-19-cases-in-tn-public-call-to-restrict-election-campaigns/articleshow/81639488.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Medicine delivery van to fulfil requirements of health, wellness centres||Chandigarh: To maintain adequate stock of medicines in health and wellness centres (HCWs), Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu flagged off a medicine delivery van. Community health officers (CHOs) have been assigned the responsibility to maintain the stock of medicines at their respective centres and they will soon be authorised to place the demand for medicines quarterly through online mode in advance from warehouses. Sharing the details, Sidhu said to ensure the supply of medicines at HCWs, the Punjab government had decided to make the supply of all 27 medicines to such centres directly from regional drug warehouse using the van. He said at present, block-level health centres were distributing the stock of medicines to all HCWs after getting it from the regional drug warehouses. This mechanism was not properly fulfilling the overall requirement of all the centres as per their demand. He said to strengthen the OPD services and ensure the supply of medicines, the state government was going to cover all districts under this programme in a phased manner as the van project was implemented in 70 HWCs of SAS Nagar district on a pilot basis, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/medicine-delivery-van-to-fulfil-requirements-of-health-wellness-centres/articleshow/81639496.cms||---

The reason behind the fire is yet to be ascertained. The BSL management is assessing the loss and the incident comes at a time when the management is putting in a lot of emphasis on increasing production considering the increase in demand for steel. BSL chief of communication, Manikant Dhan, said, “The fire in the finishing stand No. 12 of the hot strip mill was doused by the fire services team in just 15 minutes by one fire tender. The mill was normalized in two hours and work resumed soon thereafter. Efforts are also on to revive the affected stand by evening itself and technicians are already working on it. There was no significant production loss.” Notably, over three weeks back, the district disaster management authority (DDMA) had asked BSL and other companies in the district to conduct fire audits of their installations and submit reports within a month. “The BSL’s report is yet to be received but they still have a few days to submit,” district disaster management officer Shakti Kumar said. In its directive for fire audits, the DDMA had ordered the companies to submit a 17-point comprehensive report about the industrial safety mechanism in their respective units. The report should also contain incidents and disasters that occurred in their units in the last three years along with the complete details of the loss of life and property.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/fire-at-steel-plant-mill-hits-production-for-3-hrs-in-bokaro/articleshow/81638956.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Jharkhand Coaching Association president S D Mishra said a large number of coaching institutes could only enrol around 10% of students when compared to the pre-lockdown period. He informed that around 20% of the institute have shut as they were unable to bear the costs. Mishra also said owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the movement of students is far below normal and hostels are also vacant. He further said a large majority of students are still using the free online materials uploaded on various platforms. At the same time, building owners where the institutes are housed have restored pre-lockdown rent rates, which added to the financial burden of the institute proprietors. "During the lockdown, the building owners had given huge concessions, but they have restored pre-lockdown rates and above that, the number of students is quite low," Mishra added. The institutes are pinning hopes on the new batch of Class XI who are expected to attend physical classes in their respective schools soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/after-unlock-few-students-go-for-classes-at-coaching-centres/articleshow/81638977.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Sources said that the centre has been lying unused for the past eight years owing to lack of funds and proper maintenance. Detailing their renovation plan, Koderma’s divisional forest officer Suraj Kumar Singh said, “We plan to set up an audio-video gallery, a photo gallery and 3D projections, among others, to showcase different flora and fauna, including migratory birds, mammals, reptiles, etc., to the visitors. Once ready, NIC will become a one-stop centre to know about various species in the district and in Jharkhand. It will also help raise awareness regarding wildlife among students.” Speaking to TOI few days back on the project, wildlife conservator Ajit Kumar Singh, who met with an untimely death on Sunday, had said, “NIC will be a great asset for people of Koderma to understand nature in a better way. There will also be a special section for vultures at the centre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-sanctions-rs-30-lakh-for-koderma-nature-centre-revamp/articleshow/81638889.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||5 cops axed, SIT to probe H’bag idols theft||Hazaribag: Five policemen, including an assistant sub-inspector, were suspended on Monday, a day after two ancient Buddha idols were stolen, setting off a political storm and protest from Buddhist groups. A special investigation team (SIT) has also been formed to probe the theft. The idols were stolen from an Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) excavation site at Bahranpur in the foothills of Sitagarha and Silwar hills of Hazaribag. Talking to TOI, SP Karthik S said, “The stolen idols were made of sandstone. We have formed an SIT led by SDPO Mahesh Prajapati and raids are being carried out at several locations, both within and outside the state, to recover the idols. Meanwhile, we have suspended five policemen who were given the task to look after the security of the excavation site. They have been replaced by a fresh team.” Over a dozen Buddha idols and a few Hindu statuettes were recently found during an excavation in Bahranpur by the ASI. Rajendra Deori, the director of ASI (Patna), said despite the theft, they will continue with their excavation work. Meanwhile, irked by the theft, several members of a Buddhist organisation, Bhikshudham, from Agra (Uttar Pradesh) reached the excavation site on Monday. The national president of the organisation, Dham Rakshit, said, “Our delegation will soon meet officials of the Union and the state governments in this regard. The discoveries are of historical and religious significance and the governments must take them seriously.” Opposition BJP criticised the state government over the theft and accused it of laxity. Hazaribag MP Jayant Sinha said, “The incident is a classic case of negligence on the part of the Hazaribag administration and the Jharkhand government.” Manish Jaiswal, the BJP MLA from Hazaribag (Sadar), said despite the state government’s assurance to the Assembly of safeguarding the archaeological treasures during the ongoing Budget session, the police machinery failed to prevent the theft. Replying to the charges of BJP, Hazaribag district Congress president Awadesh Kumar Singh and JMM minority cell chief Ruchi Kujur claimed that the idols were stolen owing to the negligence of the district administration and not that of the state government. They said that had proper lighting arrangements been made at the excavation site, the incident could have been averted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/5-cops-axed-sit-to-probe-hbag-idols-theft/articleshow/81638844.cms||Abhijit Sen

Deputy director PTR (south) Mukesh Kumar confirmed the receipt of the fund and said, "We will deposit the amount in the Palamu Tiger Foundation so that we don't face any issues of lapses by the end of the ongoing financial year as barely a few weeks are left for the fiscal to end." He said the two villages in the core area of PTR -- Latu and Kujrum -- have a total population of 210 residents. Kumar added that depositing the amount to the foundation will also enable them to start the relocation process soon and use the money as and when necessary. On the relocation process, Kumar said the residents are ready to move to areas identified by the government. He said, "According to the plan, 90 residents from Latu village will be resettled at Lai Paila Pathar near Sarju in Latehar district on a chunk of 130-acre land. The rest of the residents from Kujrum village will be resettled at Polpol in Palamu district on a 160-acre land. Kumar added, “We have two financial packages for the relocation. The first plan is to provide Rs 10 lakh for every resident after the government provides everything to resettle them and the second is to give Rs 15 lakh in which beneficiaries will have to make their own arrangements for livelihood and living. People are free to choose either of the two packages.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ptr-gets-rs-26cr-to-relocate-210-villagers-from-core-area/articleshow/81638948.cms||---

Notably, some parts of the country have witnessed a sharp spike in the number of fresh cases in recent days. Simdega is scheduled to host the national hockey tournament for junior women from April 3. A total of 28 teams will take part in the tournament. The district successfully hosted the sub-junior national hockey meet for women, which concluded last week. Talking to TOI, Simdega deputy commissioner Sushant Gaurav said, “With the fear of a second wave looming large, we have to be vigilant. Moreover, we have to host a national tournament and festivals like Holi and Sarhul are also coming up. The inter-state borders with Odisha and Chhattisgarh, too, are a cause of concern.” Gaurav visited different markets and hotels on Sunday to monitor if the establishments and the customers were adhering to Covid protocols. He was accompanied by SDO Mahendra Kumar. The DC also separately interacted with many autorickshaw drivers and asked them to follow the guidelines. Notably, Simdega had the third highest number of cases after Ranchi and East Singhbhum in July-August last year, when it recorded over 1,300 infections. Simdega civil surgeon P K Sinha said, “Till now, a total 2,071 cases have been reported from the district.

All India Congress Committee (AICC) formally notified the list of its star campaigners in the morning which included AICC’s interim president Sonia Gandhi, former PM Manmohan Singh, Priyanka Gandhi and Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot among others. The assembly polls in Bengal are split into eight phases starting from March 27. The third phase will be held on April 6. In Bengal, Congress has allied with the Left in the upcoming election which is seen as a fight mainly between the ruling TMC and opposition BJP. While Sahay, a veteran Congressman, was an MP from Ranchi multiple times, Alamgir represents the Pakur assembly seat in Santhal Pargana bordering Bengal. Meanwhile, Congress leaders from the state have also begun canvassing for its candidates in both Bengal and Assam. While state health minister and Jamshedpur (West) MLA, Banna Gupta, campaigned in Purulia's Balrampur constituency on March 20, the party's MLA from Mandar, Bandhu Tirkey, has been camping in Assam for the last two days. State Congress president and finance minister Rameshwar Oraon is expected to leave for Assam to begin campaigning in the tea estates soon. Congress spokesperson Lal Kishorenath Shahdeo said the entire state unit is geared up to contribute to the party’s efforts for Bengal and Assam assembly polls. He said, "The party high command has tasked many leaders from the state unit with important roles and we are committed to sweat it out on the field for good performance and results."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/aiccs-sahay-alam-among-30-star-campaigners-for-bengal-polls/articleshow/81639476.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||J’khand assembly fails to pass resolution against farm laws||Ranchi: The state government’s plan to debate and pass a resolution against the three central farm laws during the Budget session in the assembly on Monday failed after speaker Ravindranath Mahto adjourned the proceedings midway following a ruckus created by the opposition BJP. The saffron party was against any discussion on the laws and prevented the treasury bench to proceed with it. Talking to media persons outside the assembly later, labour minister Satyanand Bhokta said, “We wanted to debate the farm laws after taking a decision in this regard in the business advisory council. However, the BJP members hijacked the proceedings and disrupted it.” Initially, the resolution was supposed to be passed after debates on the “farm bills” along with the rising prices of essential commodities, for which a notice was given by CPI-ML MLA Vinod Singh and JVM-P legislator Pradeep Yadav. As soon as the Speaker asked Vinod to initiate the debate, BJP legislators sought a clarification on the term “farm bill”. BJP’s Ranchi MLA and former speaker C P Singh asked the chair to clarify which bills were being referred to for the debate. He said, “There is no farm bill in our knowledge. If the members want to discuss farmers’ issues, we have no objection but by including the term ‘bill’, they are trying to mislead the members.” Meanwhile, Vinod started speaking against the farm laws, describing them as black laws which are aimed at benefiting the corporates and not farmers, but he was soon shouted down by the BJP MLAs who gathered in the well sporting black T-shirts to register their protest against any attempt to discuss the farm laws. They continued to raise slogans against the government from the well and a few sat on chairs at the reporters’ table, preventing them from recording the proceedings. JMM’s Samir Kumar Mahanty accused BJP of high-handedness but soon became inaudible in the ruckus. After a few attempts to bring the House in order failed, the Speaker adjourned it. Vinod later said, “It is irrelevant on what terminology the debate was initiated. BJP MLAs picked a non-issue to avoid debating the farm laws. The saffron party had adopted similar tactics even in Parliament when they got the bills passed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha without any debate.” He claimed that the mahagathbandhan government was non-committal in getting the resolution passed. “The resolution could have been passed even without a debate since they are in majority. I hope they pass it before the conclusion of the Budget session on Tuesday,” he said. Independent MLA Saryu Rai blamed the government “for its lack of conviction” and said, “What was the need to use the term ‘farm bills’ for a debate when everyone knows it has become law. A general debate on farming and farmers’ condition could have been initiated instead.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-assembly-fails-to-pass-resolution-against-farm-laws/articleshow/81639458.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Last year, the city police had received some funds to clear the dues of the previous years while there was almost nothing left to settle the expenses of the current year. The three Bolero jeeps sanctioned this month after a long wait too aren’t anywhere close to filling the gap, 175 vehicles in a fleet of 822. City police had to procure around 15 vehicles from NIT through the collector to make up for the condemned fleet which had to be withdrawn. Out of 650 vehicles on road, around 335 are two-wheelers. The shortages of vehicles had compelled around six jeeps, which were sanctioned for the proposed 112 emergency line, to be used for current routine duties. “A relentless follow up by the CP (Amitesh Kumar) had ensured 72 bikes and 15 cars were sanctioned through the district planing committee (DPC) fund which are being procured through the government e-marketplace (GeM),” he said. “Some funds have been released now by the department for the motor transport wing which are being now utilized to clear the dues of the vendors pending since long. The vendors were earlier reluctant to give supplies but the channels are being opened up again,” said the senior officer. Kumar too said the maintenance and repair of the police vehicles have been affected by the shortage of funds but different strategies are being worked out to overcome it. Several senior officers at the police stations had shared their plight with the maintenance and repair of the vehicles. “The repair and maintenance works of vehicles have become questionably compromising in quality. If the police department loses mobility then it would be a major problem for the ground-level force to work smoothly,” said a senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-crunch-leaves-police-vehicles-in-the-lurch/articleshow/81639505.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Ranchi||Ajsu-P’s Ganga Narayan joins BJP, may get Madhupur ticket||RANCHI: Former Ajsu Party leader Ganga Narayan Singh formally joined the BJP on Monday, with less than a month to go for the Madhupur assembly bypoll scheduled on April 17. Singh’s name was among a list of BJP probables for the Madhupur seat, which was recommended by the party’s state election committee to the central leadership last week. Singh had fought from Madhupur on an Ajsu Party ticket in 2019 and came third. JMM’s Haji Hussain Ansari had won that election, while BJP’s Raj Paliwar finished runner-up. The seat fell vacant after the death of Ansari in October last year. Singh joined BJP in a low-key ceremony in the presence of former chief minister Babulal Marandi and other senior office-bearers of the party. Marandi said, “The party will get additional strength in Deoghar with the entry of Ganga Narayan Singh.” Singh said: “I feel proud to be accepted by the BJP and will work towards fulfilling the party’s vision in service of the people.” A BJP leader said on the condition of anonymity: “Singh had secured over 40,000 votes in 2019 solely on his own as Ajsu Party didn’t have much base in Madhupur. So, there is a feeling in the party that if he is fielded on a BJP ticket, we can have an immediate headway of 40,000 votes and the rest required to defeat the JMM can be garnered through our election machinery.” While Ajsu Party had initially staked claim to the Madhupur seat, BJP insiders said that it backed out as the Sudesh Mahto-led outfit was allowed to contest the Baghmundi seat in West Bengal under the banner of NDA. In the last assembly election, both the parties fought separately after snapping their alliance over a failed seat-sharing deal. The division of NDA votes backfired, making way for the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance to form the government. Ajsu Party later returned to the NDA fold before last year’s Rajya Sabha elections in the state. “The BJP and the Ajsu Party are natural allies in Jharkhand and we will stay united to fight the wrong politics of the Hemant Soren-led government,” state BJP president Deepak Prakash said. This will be the third bypoll since the ruling alliance came to power in December 2019. In 2020, JMM clinched Dumka and Congress retained Barhait. Marandi, however, said that the contest for Madhupur is wide open. “BJP is sure of winning this seat,” he said. The JMM-Congress-RJD coalition will field Hafizul Ansari, the son of Haji Hussain Ansari, as its candidate. Ansari will file his nomination on March 25. The Congress took a dig at Singh’s induction into the BJP. “While the BJP claims to be the world’s largest party, but it is banking on party hoppers in every election. In West Bengal, the party is relying on turncoats and it is doing the same in Madhupur,” Congress’s co-working president Rajesh Thakur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ajsu-ps-ganga-narayan-joins-bjp-may-get-madhupur-ticket/articleshow/81639468.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Earlier, a polling agent had to be a voter of the booth where she/he was to be a polling agent. The new norm will help parties allocate a polling agent to each booth, an EC official said. The norm, he added, keeps in mind the new normal, where a party may find it difficult to appoint a polling agent from the same booth due to the pandemic. Explaining the previous norm, the EC official said earlier it was expected that a polling agent from the booth she/he votes from would be able to identify all voters of that booth and spot impostors. But due to Covid, polling stations in Bengal have increased from 78,903 in the 2019 LS polls to 1,01,790 now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/ec-revises-its-norms-allows-some-flexibility-on-poll-agents/articleshow/81642040.cms||Debashish Konar
