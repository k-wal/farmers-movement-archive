The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted the prospects of gaming companies as people stayed at home and turned to video games for entertainment during lockdowns. Discord, which was valued at around $7 billion as of December, is a platform on which users coordinate group activities such as games, discussions and even virtual parties. Microsoft has been looking to own mass social media platforms, although its last big deal was the $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn in 2016 as it failed in its bid for short video app TikTok’s US assets in September last year. Xbox maker Microsoft has also been trying to strengthen its video game offerings, with its $7.5 billion purchase of ZeniMax Media last year its biggest ever in the field. Discord has reached out to potential buyers and Microsoft is one of them, Bloomberg News reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter. One person said it was more likely to go public than sell itself. The sources requested anonymity as the discussions are private. Microsoft declined to comment, while Discord did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/microsoft-in-talks-to-buy-discord-messaging-platform-report/articleshow/81657612.cms||---

It has also shared with the RBI a list of such banks that have not adhered to Trai's regulatory requirements, as also relevant data on SMS traffic failures, sources added. Separately, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) in a statement said that all major banks and big telemarketers sending SMS have failed to fulfil regulatory requirements despite repeated reminders. Sources privy to the development told PTI that the telecom regulator has approached the Reserve Bank of India to get a direction issued to all banks and financial institutions to comply with stipulated rules aimed at curbing pesky calls and bulk messages. Trai has also written to the Department of Financial Services on the matter. The regulator informed the RBI that as per the provisions of the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018, the telecom operators have activated the content scrubbing from March 17, 2021. However, for the time being, even the traffic which has failed in the content scrubbing is allowed to be delivered, to avoid the inconvenience to the consumers. Trai has further said that based on the report submitted by the telecom operators, it has been observed that certain banks have still not complied with regulatory requirements. Noting that telcos are intimating the failure reasons to concerned 'Principal Entities', Trai has urged the RBI to direct such banks to fulfil the regulatory requirements immediately, failing which their communication to customers may be disrupted, sources said. Additionally, the regulator has also reached out to state government departments, chief secretaries, and all major government entities that send out bulk messages on the bulk message issue, sources added. Meanwhile, Trai said in a statement that it "once again requests all the Entities who are using the telecom resources to send bulk messages to the consumers, to fulfil the regulatory requirements immediately so that there would not be any disruption in the communication to the customers." Trai has issued the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018 (TCCCPR, 2018) on July 19, 2018, to curb the menace of Unsolicited Commercial Communications (UCC), which put in place a framework for controlling UCC. The regulations entirely came into force with effect from February 29, 2019. According to the rules all entries that send one-time password (OTP), transactional messages, service messages or commercial messages are required to fulfil regulatory requirements for sending bulk communication. "The regulatory provisions not only help in preventing spam but also help in preventing fraudulent messages purporting to originate from banks, financial institutions, or other trusted sources," Trai said. Trai said that when telecom operators started filtering out non-compliance messages from the system there was a huge drop in sms sent to people from applications. "It was observed that some of the principal entities have not fulfilled the requirements as envisaged TCCCPR, 2018 even after two years despite being fully aware of the regulations and the consequences," Trai said. The regulator temporarily suspended the scrubbing of SMS for seven days on March 9 to enable principle entities to register the SMS templates to avoid inconvenience faced by the customers. "Unfortunately, despite repeated communication, all major banks and big telemarketers sending SMS have failed to fulfill regulatory requirements. All are being notified individually also. Trai has called for further reports from telecom service providers," Trai statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/trai-urges-rbi-to-direct-banks-to-comply-with-norms-on-bulk-messages/articleshow/81657851.cms||---

A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R S Reddy and M R Shah said, "Once the payment of instalment is deferred as per March 27, 2020 circular, non-payment of the instalment during the moratorium period cannot be said to be wilful and therefore there is no justification to charge interest on interest/compound interest/penal interest for the period during the moratorium." Writing the 148-page judgment for the bench, Justice Shah said, "Therefore, we are of the opinion that there shall not be any charge of interest on interest/compound interest/penal interest for the period during the moratorium from any of the borrowers and whatever the amount is recovered by way of interest on interest/compound interest/penal interest for the period during the moratorium, the same shall be refunded and adjusted/given credit in the next instalment of the loan account." Except for this hit, the Centre's other decisions to provide relief to people, industry and corporate houses during the pandemic period won wholesome praise from the SC, which said, "It appears, whatever best can be offered has been offered for the different fields and to the common people as well as those persons who are affected due to Covid19 pandemic." The bench examined and rejected a batch of petitions filed by industries and borrowers seeking various financial relief, including extension of moratorium period and complete waiver of interest during the moratorium period. However, the bench said the issue of waiver of interest on interest during the six-month moratorium period when the government had offered deferment of payment of equalised monthly instalments towards repayment of loans stood on a different footing. The government had waived interest on interest for deferred EMIs for loans up to Rs 2 crore taken by MSMEs, educational loans, auto and housing loans, personal loans and credit card dues. Justice Shah said, "There is no justification shown to restrict the relief of not charging interest on interest with respect to loans up to Rs 2 crore only and that too restricted to the aforesaid categories. What is the basis to restrict it to Rs 2 crore is not forthcoming. Therefore, as such, there is no rationale to restrict such relief with respect to loans up to Rs 2 crore only." The Centre's October 23, 2020 decision to grant waiver of interest on interest was qualified with the rider that the cumulative loans taken by an individual or industry must be below Rs 2 crore. Justice Shah explained the fallacy of the scheme through an example. "If the borrower has been sanctioned a loan of Rs 5 crore and has availed of the same, even though he might have repaid substantially, bringing down the principal amount to less than Rs 2 crore as on February 29, 2020 but because of the sanction of the loan amount of more than Rs 2 crore, he will be ineligible," he said. "It also further provides that the outstanding amount should not exceed Rs 2 crore and for this purpose, aggregate of all facilities with the lending institution will be reckoned. Therefore, if a borrower, for example MSME category, has availed and has outstanding business loan of Rs 1.99 crore and also has dues of its credit card of Rs 1.1 lakh, thereby making the aggregate to Rs 2.1 crore, it stands ineligible. Therefore, the aforesaid conditions would be arbitrary and discriminatory," he added. The SC noted various schemes announced by the government during the pandemic to provide relief to several sectors of the economy and said the best possible was done by the government despite the resource crunch due to low generation of GST. "The Centre has announced ‘Garib Kalyan package’ for Rs 2 lakh crore, involving free foodgrain, pulses, gas cylinders and cash payment to women, poor senior citizens and farmers; ‘Aatmanirbhar package’ for various sectors like power, real estate, MSME. It also promulgated Emergency Credit-Linked Guarantee Scheme of Rs 3 lakh crore providing additional credit at lower rate of interest, with 100% government guarantee and no fresh collateral. The scheme has been extended with higher financial limits to 27 Covid-19 impacted sectors including restaurant and hotel sectors. The Centre has also granted Rs 20,000 crores subordinate debt with partial credit guarantee for over 2 lakh stressed MSME units including from hospitality sector," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-waives-interest-on-interest-for-loans-above-2-crore-too/articleshow/81658973.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

He said, “I fail to understand the kind of secularism Congress talks about.” Countering Trinamool’s “outsider” jibe at BJP, Shah said TMC leaders should see the size of turnouts for PM Modi’s rallies. “People in Bengal are yearning for a change from misrule and will embrace the PM vision for the state’s development,” he said, adding BJP would win more than 200 (out of 294) seats. “NDA will once again form the government in Tamil Nadu”, he said. “The biggest factor is the agenda of development on which the Modi government is working. Modi’s vision will strike a chord with the people of Bengal (and voters elsewhere),” Shah told TOI on his campaign trail in Assam. In his poll meetings, the home minister said the BJP government had established peace in Assam, with curfews and infiltration much reduced.

---||India||At 276, India sees highest one-day Covid toll this year||NEW DELHI: India reported the highest single-day death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic this year, with 276 fatalities recorded on Tuesday. Fresh cases too rose to 47,281, the highest daily count since November 11. The last time more Covid-related deaths were recorded in a single day was December 30 last year, when the toll was 300. Tuesday’s number was a sharp rise from the 197 fatalities recorded on Monday and 213 on Sunday. Maharashtra accounted for nearly half of the count, recording 134 deaths in the last 24 hours. This was the highest single-day toll in the state in 123 days since November 20, when 155 fatalities were recorded. Mortalities from the virus continued to be high in Punjab, which reported 53 deaths on Tuesday, followed by 20 in Chhattisgarh, 10 in Kerala and nine in Tamil Nadu. Maharashtra also logged 28,699 fresh cases, its second-highest count after 30,535 new infections were reported on Sunday, with Mumbai adding over 3,000 cases (3,514) for the third day in a row. As many as 12 states reported their highest single-day counts of new cases since January or earlier, with Gujarat recording its highest-ever count of 1,730. Five states/Union territories recorded their biggest surges since November. These were Karnataka, which logged 2,010 fresh cases, the highest since November 14, Chhattisgarh (1,910 cases, highest since November 23), Madhya Pradesh (1,502, highest since November 29), Tamil Nadu (1,437, highest since November 29) and Puducherry (87, highest since November 11). Besides, Delhi added 1,101 cases to its tally, the highest since December 19. Haryana numbers climbed to 895, the most since December 14, and Uttar Pradesh was at 638, its highest count since January 10. Surges were also recorded in Andhra Pradesh (492), Telangana (412), Jharkhand (130) and Bihar (111). With cases now rising in UP, Bihar and Odisha, the Covid surge now covers the whole of India, barring Kerala and the northeast. Active cases in India crossed the 3.5-lakh mark to settle close to 3.7 lakh by late Tuesday, just three days after going past the 3-lakh mark. On Sunday, active cases have jumped by more than 25,000, the highest single-day rise since the start of the pandemic in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-276-india-sees-highest-one-day-covid-toll-this-year/articleshow/81659539.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||India||MHA permits states to impose local curbs||NEW DELHI: Keeping in view the fresh surge in Covid-19 cases in some parts of the country, the new home ministry guidelines valid through April mandate the states and UT to strictly enforce the ‘test-track-treat’ protocol and also allow states to impose local restrictions at district, sub-district, city and ward level. All activities shall continue to be permitted outside containment zones with SOPs prescribed for various activities like movement by passenger trains, air travel, metro trains, schools, higher educational institutions, hotels and restaurants, shopping malls, multiplexes and entertainment parks, yoga centres and gymnasiums, exhibitions, assemblies and congregations. The Centre has asked states to ensure observance of Covid appropriate behaviour including by imposing appropriate fines, and efforts to scale up the vaccination drive. Elaborating on the ‘test-track-treat’ protocol, the home ministry said the states and UTs, where the proportion of RT-PCR tests is less, should rapidly increase it to reach the prescribed level of 70% or more. The new positive cases, detected as a result of intensive testing, need to be isolated/ quarantined at the earliest and provided timely treatment. Further as per the protocol, their contacts have to be traced at the earliest, and similarly isolated/ quarantined, state the guidelines. While stating that the vaccination drive was proceeding smoothly, the home ministry said it was a matter of concern that the pace was uneven across different states and UTs. Terming vaccination against Covid-19 as critical to break the chain of transmission, the ministry asked all the state/UT governments to rapidly step up the pace of vaccination, to cover all priority groups in an expeditious manner. The main focus of the guidelines, said MHA, is to consolidate the substantial gains achieved in containing the spread of Covid-19, which was visible in the sustained decline in the number of active cases, continuously for about five months. State/ UT governments have been asked to take all necessary measures to promote Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in work places and in public, especially in crowded places. For strict enforcement of wearing of face masks, hand hygiene and social distancing, states and UTs may consider administrative actions, including imposition of appropriate fines, said the home ministry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mha-permits-states-to-impose-local-curbs/articleshow/81659873.cms||---

To ascertain whether the highly infectious strain is behind the surge, the government will increase the size of samples to be sent for genome sequencing. “A large and fresh sample of people who have tested positive will be sent to the national laboratory. It will help us know if the current findings are incidental, or if the variant is actually behind the surge,” he said. As the UK strain increases the risk of death, samples from patients who died of the virus will also be sent for genome sequencing. Cases spike in NRI hubThe state recorded 15,836 new Covid cases and 283 deaths in the last week. The caseload jumped by over 59% and the death rate by over 79% from March 9 to 22. Of the total, 36% (5,684) cases and 50% of deaths (143) were reported from the Doaba region, which comprises four districts and is also known as the “NRI hub”. Jalandhar contributed 2,200 cases and 55 deaths, followed by Hoshiarpur where 1,807 people tested positive last week and 50 succumbed. Kapurthala and Nawanshahr reported 932 and 745 cases and 11 and 27 deaths, respectively. Lagging in key area The prevalence of the UK strain warrants stringent compliance with safety guidelines, including maintaining social distancing and masking, two measures the state government has so far struggled to enforce. Dr Ram Kumar, president, Society for Promotion of Ethical and Affordable Healthcare, said as the new variant is highly infectious, people need to take precautions, besides taking steps to build immunity through a rich diet and physical activity. To protect the vulnerable population, there is a need to increase vaccination coverage, an area in which Punjab is lagging. As of March 22, Punjab has administrated the first dose of the vaccine to 2,32,512 beneficiaries in the 60-plus population and the 45-plus population with co-morbidities. It has so far provided the first dose to 1,28,895 frontline workers and 1,27,042 health workers. Expressing displeasure over low numbers in the state, chief minister Amarinder Singh had directed all private and government hospitals and health facilities to offer hassle-free vaccination services for at least eight hours a day and seven days a week till March 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uk-strain-found-in-81-of-new-punjab-covid-cases/articleshow/81659045.cms||Vinod Kumar

The event coincided with Pakistan Day that commemorates the adoption of Lahore Resolution on this day in 1940 and which was traditionally observed in Kashmir too. The confluence of religious scholars from different parts of Jammu & Kashmir was organised as part of a civil society initiative by J&K Nationalist People’s Front, with which Art of Living Foundation founded by spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is associated. Of course, with J&K LG Manoj Sinha joining the event as chief guest, the initiative has the backing of UT government as well. A similar event was organised in Jammu earlier this year. As per the correct interpretation of Quranic verses, cleric Mufti Mohammad Aslam told TOI on the sidelines of Srinagar conference, Islam does not teach its followers to take lives of fellow humans or bring them to harm but to protect and peacefully co-exist with one and all, irrespective of their religion. He said ‘jihad’ really means fight with one’s own ‘nafsaani khwahish’ (deadly sin). J&K LG Sinha, in his keynote address, said that some Islamic scholars who had either not studied religious texts in detail or were deliberately focusing on only a part of the teachings and wrongly interpreting them, “were doing great harm to not only Kashmir and India but to the entire world”. He said similar efforts to involve Islamic scholars in putting out correct interpretations of Islamic texts were being take up across the world to counter radicalisation. He however added that the radicalisation in India was not very prevalent as compared to other countries. “Islam teaches one to practice peace, harmony and sensitivity. It is this correct interpretation of Islam that all the Muftis and moulvis gathered here today shall propagate among the people through their Friday sermons from mosques in J&K. A similar message shall go out to those studying at madarsas here, as well as to family units, especially the mothers, to educate their children so that they do not get swayed by ‘false’ narratives being peddled to radicalise them,” another cleric Mufti Mohammad Nasiruddin told TOI. Sheikh Muzaffar of J&K Nationalist Peoples’ Front told TOI that women were roped in especially as they are the first institution of learning for a child. Similarly, the attempt shall be to modernise madarasa education not necessarily through a government intervention but by involving the clerics teaching there to voluntarily propagate the counter-narrative. Muzaffar added that some political parties, for the sake of votebank politics, had played along and even encouraged the clerics to peddle wrong interpretations of Islam, which pushed the youths of Kashmir already frustrated due to lack of employment opportunities and constructive engagement, to terror. According to Sanjay Kumar, a social activist associated with Art of Living, Islamic clerics and scholars were being involved in counter radicalisation as they were the ones who “installed the radicalisation software” and so were best suited to “uninstall it”. Woman participant and panchayat member from Anantnag Khaleda Parvin said educating women would make them dissuading their young ones from radicalisation, though the government should do its bit by engaging them gainfully and offering them job opportunities through skill development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kashmir-event-rejects-flawed-jihad-interpretation-fights-radicalisation/articleshow/81660164.cms||Bharti Jain
---||India||Uddhav sat on intel report on transfer racket: BJP||MUMBAI: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray chose not to act on a report pertaining to a racket on transfer of police officials brought to his notice only to save his government, opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis of BJP alleged in a fresh attack on the Maha Vikas Aghadi government on Tuesday. Fadnavis demanded a reaction from the CM, saying Thackeray must make a statement, and said he had with him a copy of the August 2020 report prepared by then commissioner of intelligence Rashmi Shukla, which includes a 6.3 GB file on call data intercepts. He said he would submit it to the Union home secretary for investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). By evening, Fadnavis had reached Delhi and handed over the report to Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla. “The chief minister did not take any action though the GAD (general administration department) comes under him. The report has been with the government since August 2020, but till date no action has been taken on it. Seems like he shielded and protected this entire racket to save his government,” Fadnavis alleged at a press conference at the state BJP headquarters in the morning. Fadnavis said the report with the intercepted call data was submitted by Shukla to then director general of police Subodh Jaiswal on August 25 last year, who in turn submitted it to the ACS (home) on August 26. The phone tapping was done after permission from then additional chief secretary (home) Sitaram Kunte, he said. The call data intercepts include names of senior IPS and non-IPS officers, junior officers and politicians, Fadnavis pointed out. The report had subsequently reached the CM, he said, but no action was taken. “In his covering letter, the DG has recommended it be brought to the notice of the chief minister and identify those named. He had also asked that the secrecy of the report be ensured to avoid bringing disrepute to the government,” said Fadnavis. Fadnavis accused the MVA government of “punishing” commissioner of intelligence Shukla, “who has worked on the post under three governments and has an impeccable record for exposing the transfer racket”. “Rashmi Shukla, despite being the seniormost police officer, was overlooked for a promotion. She was promoted as director general of civil defence — a non-existent post not even sanctioned by the cabinet. On the other hand, those whose names surface in the call intercepts have got the posts they wanted,” Fadnavis alleged. He added that “since the Union home secretary is the custodian and the chief minister, despite being in charge of GAD, did nothing to act on the report, I shall be submitting the report to the Centre”. He however refused to share the call data intercepts’ pen drive with the media, saying it contained sensitive information and he would submit it to the Union home secretary. Speaking to the media later in the evening after meeting Bhalla, Fadnavis said, “I have handed over all the evidence with me in a sealed envelope. Whom was the government (MVA) trying to protect? We need to address all these issues. We want this to be inquired into by the CBI.” The opposition leader said he would not stop here. “If required we shall even approach the courts,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uddhav-sat-on-intel-report-on-transfer-racket-bjp/articleshow/81660390.cms||---

In the report, accessed by TOI, the CGWB has recommended that Delhi Jal Board (DJB) should use groundwater for supply in E, M and S blocks of the neighbourhood between April and October after obtaining permission from Delhi Advisory Committee. “The jal board is recommended to construct around eight piezometers at suitable locations across Kalkaji to monitor change in water regime. It should also construct around six heavy-duty tubewells or use existing tubewells for domestic supply during monsoon — from June to September — or beyond depending on water levels in proposed piezometers, after obtaining permission,” stated the final report of CGWB. A senior DJB official, meanwhile, said that they were yet to receive the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gk-residents-seek-end-to-seepage-woes/articleshow/81658507.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Bad loans to rise by Rs 1.3 lakh crore after SC’s nod for NPA tag||MUMBAI: Lenders will see bad loans rise by Rs 1.3 lakh crore and an outgo of Rs 7,000-9,000 crore as reimbursement of interest on interest to those with loans outstanding during the moratorium period. The Supreme Court on Tuesday said that it will not interfere in the classification of non-performing assets (NPAs) but directed lenders to waive interest on interest for all borrowers. Earlier, the government had reimbursed interest on interest dues to those who had loans outstanding below Rs 2 crore. The order is positive for lenders as it removes uncertainty on the classification of defaulters. The lifting of the stay on the classification of loans as NPAs will not hurt banks as they have been keeping money aside for this eventuality. However, the additional relief to large borrowers has come as a surprise as retail and MSME customers with loans up to Rs 2 crore, who were seen as deserving cases, were granted interest on interest relief by the government. This has now been scaled up to cover all borrowers by the Supreme Court. “The judgment today lifts the cloud of expectations, which held back opportunistic borrowers from regularising their dues even if they had means to do so. The ruling helps in strengthening the credit culture by paving way for restoring credit discipline,” said Indian Banks Association chairman and Union Bank MD Rajkiran Rai. With no NPA relief to borrowers, bank stocks were major gainers. Bank of Maharashtra, Indian Overseas Bank, and Bank of India gained around 10%. Bandhan, IndusInd, ICICI, HDFC, and Axis Bank all gained over 2%. Public sector banks also saw gains. “According to our estimates, the compounded interest for six months of moratorium across all lenders is estimated at Rs 13,500-14,000 crore. The government had already announced relief for borrowers having borrowings up to Rs 2 crore, which was estimated to cost about Rs 6,500 crore to the exchequer,” said financial sector ratings ICRA’s VP Anil Gupta. “With the announcement of waiver for all borrowers, the additional relief of Rs 7,000-7,500 crore will need to be provided to borrowers,” he said. Since the government had provided compensation for the earlier compound interest waiver, there is a possibility that the fresh round of waivers would also be funded by the government. But even if it was passed on to the banks, the impact would not be more than a few hundred crores for most banks. According to ICRA’s estimates, in the absence of the SC’s standstill order, the gross NPAs (GNPAs) of the banks stood at Rs 8.7 lakh crore, or 8.3% of advances. This, as against the reported GNPA of Rs 7.4 lakh crore (7.1%) as on December 31, 2020. “Hence, in absence of a standstill by the Supreme Court, the GNPAs for the banks would have been higher by Rs 1.3 lakh crore (1.2%) and net NPAs would have been higher by Rs 1 lakh crore (1%),” said Gupta. “Banks have sufficient capital. We expect the government allocation of the balance Rs 14,500 crore for the current financial year (as capital to public sector banks) in the next few days,” said Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bad-loans-to-rise-by-rs-1-3l-cr-after-scs-nod-for-npa-tag/articleshow/81658453.cms||---
---||Patna||Patna: Police arrest 2 for killing a cash van guard, looting Rs 9 lakh||PATNA: Police arrested two men from a rented room at Nehru Nagar under Patliputra police station area here on Monday night for allegedly looting Rs 9 lakh after shooting a guard in front of an ATM kiosk at Alpana market in Patliputra Colony on March 19. The guard, Lal Saheb Singh, later died. Addressing media persons on Tuesday, City SP (central) Vinay Tiwari said the arrested youths Aditya Ranjan alias Kanhai Singh and Vicky Kumar are from Sitamarhi. The SP said that Rs 5.25 lakh of the looted amount, two country-made semi-automatic pistols, seven live cartridges, a motorbike and clothes worn at the time of the crime were recovered from their possession. "Aditya is a notorious wanted criminal accused in several cases like kidnapping, extortion, loot and dacoity registered with different police stations of Sitamarhi and neighbouring districts," Tiwari said, adding, Aditya has been evading arrest there. The SP said Sitamarhi police have been informed of the arrest and added that both accused have been jailed multiple times in the past. SP Tiwari said it was Aditya who had fired at the guard which resulted in his death at a hospital. "Police have the pistol used in the crime, pellet recovered from the guard's body and an empty cartridge ejected at the spot would be sent to the forensic laboratory for ballistic matching to establish that the same gun was used. Police also have CCTV camera footages of the crime in which they are visible wearing the clothes recovered from their room," he said. The SP said two more associates of Aditya were still evading arrest and the rest of the looted money was in their possession. "They have fled Patna. Aditya and Vicky were also planning to escape from the state," he said. Tiwari said Aditya had hired a room at Nehru Nagar two months ago with a forged identity card. "The bike recovered from them was looted in Sitamarhi," he said. The SP said it was the gang’s first crime in Patna. "Their motive was to loot cash at the time it was taken out of cash vans for feeding in ATM kiosks. They were trailing the cash van targeted on March 19 for at least two days," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/police-arrest-2-for-killing-a-cash-van-guard-looting-rs-9l/articleshow/81656760.cms||---

He said the area near sugar mills would be relieved from the category of reserved area. The minister was replying to a short-notice question raised by RJD MLC Ram Chandra Purbey, who had pointed out the problems being faced by sugar cane farmers with the closure of Riga Sugar Mill. Purbey said these farmers were compelled to sell their produce at a low price. “Because of the reserved area, they could not sell sugar cane for any other use apart from sugar production. They should be given the option to use sugar cane for production of jaggery and unrefined sugar. Nearly 40,000 sugarcane farmers are suffering because of the closure of the mill,” he said. The minister said after the closure of Riga Mill, the state government was sending sugar cane to mills located in other places at its own cost. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra raised the issue of alleged forgery done by the manager of Riga Sugar Mill. “Instead of making payment for sugar cane, the mill manager had opened an account of farmers in a bank and taken kisan credit card loan,” he said. To this, the minister said an FIR was lodged in connection with the case and a team of STF is in Kolkata to arrest the accused. To a question raised by BJP MLC Nawal Kishore Yadav regarding cleanliness in medical college and hospitals, health minister Mangal Pandey said sanitation and cleaning was being done by private agencies. He announced in the Upper House that a 30-bed hospital would come up in Naubatpur soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/policy-to-boost-production-of-jaggery-unrefined-sugar-soon-minister/articleshow/81657715.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The bandh, which will mainly cover south Bihar and west Jharkhand, will start from Tuesday midnight and continue till 48 hours. The regional committee of the outlawed outfit has threatened to avenge the killing of the commanders, which they described as a fake encounter. The police recovered some handwritten pamphlets from Dumaria police station area in Gaya district on Tuesday. Through the pamphlets, the Maoists appealed to the locals to extend their support to the bandh. However, emergency services and vehicles used for marriage purposes will exempted from the purview of the bandh. Gaya SSP Aditya Kumar said a joint operation has been launched in Gaya and Aurangabad districts in view of the 48-hour bandh. “The hideouts of the Maoists are being searched and patrolling mounted in areas considered to be vulnerable from security point of view,” he added. The SSP said the police stations located in Maoist-hit areas have been put on alert and the police officers asked to step up vigil in sensitive pockets under their jurisdiction. “We are in touch with our counterparts in Jharkhand as well,” the SSP added. ADG (operation) S M Khopde had earlier told this correspondent that the Maoist activities had been confined to certain districts in the state. A total of 26 incidents related to left-wing extremism were reported in 2020 compared to 39 in 2019 and 40 in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/maoist-bandh-security-beefed-up-in-south-bihar/articleshow/81656478.cms||Ramashankar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kunjumon eyes a fifth consecutive win in Kunnathur||Kollam: Kunnathur, a scheduled caste (SC) reserved constituency for decades, has always been a stronghold of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kollam district. This time, the sitting MLA Kovoor Kunjumon, who is the only candidate of Revolutionary Socialist Party (Leninist) in this polls, is all set to try his luck for a fifth consecutive victory from the constituency. Over the past four terms, Kunjumon has consistently improved his majority and the constituency stood with the LDF. However, this time, the fight is crucial for the LDF, which received a setback in the 2020 LSG polls when the UDF managed to secure significant upper hand in five out of the 10 panchayats in the traditional red bastion. The defeat in five panchayats was a severe hit to the local leadership of the LDF, especially the CPM and was discussed at the district and state levels. “The setback for LDF in East Kallada, Munroethuruthu, Poruvazhy, Sooranad North and Mynagapally panchayats, despite the pro-Left wave across Kerala in the LSG polls, was a severe hit to the LDF in Kunnathur. There were several issues, including lack of coordination within the LDF, during the polls and they reflected in the results. Losing Sooranad North panchayat, a strong bastion of CPI and CPM, to the Congress where those, including senior leaders, were defeated was a clear example of lack of coordination. This time the campaign works have started in full swing and the LDF is sure about the victory,” said a local committee member of CPM. The polls will be crucial for Kunjumon too as there are reports of infighting in the RSP (L). Kunjumon has won four times since 2001 from Kunnathur, which is a traditional seat of the RSP. Even in 2016 when RSP left the LDF, Kunjumon left RSP, floated RSP (L) and contested as the LDF-independent against RSP’s Ullas Kovoor from Kunnathur winning the seat with a majority of 20,529 votes, the biggest in his four-term as legislator. “Recently, there were open fights between Kunjumon and S Baladev, the state secretary of RSP (L). Baladev expelled Kunjumon from the party alleging that the party lost the posts it could have received in boards and corporations because of the MLA’s interventions. He even demanded the constituency to be removed from the reserved constituency list. Later, Kunjumon announced that he expelled Baladev from the party. The issues between the two remain unsettled and it might reflect in the elections. Hence it is a crucial fight for Kunjumon this time,” said a party source. The UDF has entrusted the task with Ullas Kovoor again with the hope that he could give a better fight to Kunjumon this time. The UDF pins hopes on the improved results they secured in the LSG polls. The NDA candidate, Raji Prasad, is a BJP local leader from Kalluvathukal who contested to the district panchayat in the LSG polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kunjumon-eyes-a-fifth-consecutive-win-in-kunnathur/articleshow/81658498.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||Business||As loss claim ratio goes over 100%, corona policies could get costlier||Chennai: General insurers have said that their claims ratio on the two Covid-specific covers — Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak policies — has exceeded 100% which calls for a revision in rates. A claims ratio of over 100% indicates that the payout is more than the premium collected and the policy would not be sustainable unless rates are revised or premium collections pick up. That however seems unlikely as sales are flagging. This might mean that insurers will have to revise prices. Sanjay Datta, chief of underwriting and claims at ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company, confirmed this: “We have also seen loss claim ratio above 100% for Corona Kavach products. Sales of Corona Kavach have slowed down, compared to the last six months. And pricing of these products — whether general health covers or the corona covers - solely depend on the sales figures.” A member of the General Insurance Council told TOI, with the overall insurance industry’s loss claim settlement ratio above 100%, insurers struggle to afford this business. “Unless we have enough premium in our pockets, how do we settle claims,” he asks. For example, some insurers price the premium of Corona Kavach at as low as Rs 650 per annum (exclusive of GST) and provide a coverage of Rs 2 lakh. “This pricing of this cover varies from insurance companies and depends on the volume of sales and claims settled. However, the penetration of health insurance in India is still low. Indian psychology in purchasing a health insurance cover goes around two things – affordability and probability of being affected (i.e) why would something bad happen to me,” he added. He also added, “We will make price revision on our products based on the impact of both Corona cases and other non-Corona cases.” Following a spike in Coronavirus cases in 2020, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) has announced the launch of Corona Kavach Policy and made it mandatory for all General and Standalone health insurance companies to offer this policy to its customers.Corona Kavach covers pre and post-hospitalisation expenses, i.e. 15 days before hospitalization and until 30 days after discharge. Medical expenses incurred during homecare treatment are covered up to 14 days. The minimum entry age criteria for an adult is 18 years and for a child is 1 day whereas the maximum entry age limit is 65 years for adults and 25 years for a child. Corona Rakshak is a benefit-based plan that provides 100% payout of the sum insured if you are hospitalized for over 72 hours due to Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/as-loss-claim-ratio-goes-over-100-corona-policies-could-get-costlier/articleshow/81658013.cms||Mamtha Asokan

Earlier, at around 8.30pm on Sunday, sensation prevailed on UPSRTC depot campus when after hearing the sound of firing, people present there and some policemen from nearby areas ran towards the incident site and saw the body of the constable lying in a pool of blood. He was immediately rushed to the district hospital where doctors declared him brought dead. Following initial investigation, the police sent the body for postmortem and informed Pandey’s family about the incident. The SP also took stock of the incident site in night. The SP said, “When police investigated the matter thoroughly it came to light that Pandey, a native of Beniganj, was posted in Varanasi. Recently, the Raunahi police had caught liquor smugglers with consignment of liquor in Ayodhya. The main accused in this case had divulged the name of Pandey for assisting them in liquor smuggling after which he was missing for two days.” “In the Whatsapp group of the excise department staff, Pandey had posted an audio clip mentioning that his family members had no role in his personal activities and only he was responsible for it,” said Singh adding, “Pandey was upset over the possibilities of his arrest following the exposure of his nexus with the liquor smugglers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cop-shoots-self-after-his-nexuswith-liquor-smugglers-exposed/articleshow/81639348.cms||---

The next day, the sensex sank further to an intraday low of 25,639 points. But since that nadir, the index has rallied nearly 95% to its Tuesday close of 50,051 points, while investors’ wealth has more than doubled to Rs 208 lakh crore now. A deluge of fund infusion by central banks of all the large economies into their respective markets, global investors’ search for good stocks at attractive prices and the rollout of Covid vaccines across the world helped this rally, market players and fund managers said. A strong revival in revenues and profits by India Inc also supported the domestic markets, they said. On March 23 last year, after crashing over 4,000 points in intraday trades, the sensex had closed down by a record-breaking 3,935 points, or 13%. Since then, the sensex has embarked on one of the strongest rallies to touch an all-time high of 52,517 points intraday on February 16. The last phase of the rally was helped by a host of Budget proposals that raised hopes of investors about a strong revival of the Indian economy. During the past one year, foreign funds have net pumped in nearly Rs 1 lakh crore, or about $13.5 billion, into Indian stocks, data from CDSL showed. According to LKP Securities head (research) S Ranganathan, bulls have come a long way exactly one year after markets made a low the same day in 2020. And during this one year, some stocks from several sectors have seen their prices rise manifold. Data from the BSE showed that among the sensex stocks, RIL has more than doubled during the same period, which is also the stock that added the most to the index. Some of the other stocks that doubled during the same period were IndusInd Bank, M&M, Infosys and Axis Bank. In the broader market, during the past year, pharma, software and banking stocks led the gainers initially, while in the past few months metal stocks made a strong revival.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/from-crash-of-record-4k-pts-last-year-sensex-gains-95-m-cap-2x/articleshow/81658341.cms||---

Financial giants such as Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, consulting firms including Boston Consulting Group (BCG), and top-tier tech companies like TCS have picked more candidates than previous years at leading business schools, data showed. At IIM-Bengaluru, consulting firms were top hirers making 165 offers. Accenture with 45 offers, Bain & Company (24), McKinsey & Company (18), and BCG (13) led the segment. The IT sector — represented by Microsoft, Browserstack, Ola, Byju’s and others — came in second, making 78 offers in all. Financial giants made a total of 67 offers with Goldman Sachs leading with 22 offers. Last year, at IIM-B, consulting companies made 147 offers, IT companies made 38 offers, and 42 offers were recorded in the finance domain. At IIM-Calcutta, consulting and investment banking roles comprised roughly half the placements, hiring 149 students and 90 students respectively. In a reflection of current trends, software services and e-commerce platforms boosted their hiring from the campus, the institute said. As for IIM-Ahmedabad, McKinsey, BCG and TCS were the top hirers, making 36, 30 and 14 offers respectively. IIMs do not disclose salary packages, but industry sources told TOI that average pay rose only in lower single-digits compared to last year. At IFMR Graduate School of Business (now part of Krea University), finance, consulting and tech giants hired over 80% of the students already placed compared to an average of 61% in such domains in previous years. Four of the top five global banks — JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citi — together hired over 40 students (almost 25% of the batch), the institute said. Despite the pandemic, average salaries rose by 10% in these domains and stood at Rs 11.4 lakh. At the Indian School of Business (ISB), consulting industry accounted for 34% of offers, providing an average CTC of Rs 29.7 lakh. Last year, this industry accounted for 23% of the total offers. At Great Lakes Institute of Management, the class of 2020 had got approximately 20% job offers from banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), and this year the number has hit 31%. Placement experts said while sectors facing tailwinds from the pandemic hired more, conventional retail, manufacturing, hospitality and others reduced offers, and the overall number of offers per student remained subdued. Average pay packages too saw only muted single-digit growth. TeamLease Edtech founder & CEO Shantanu Rooj said offshoring is catching up again as work can be done digitally irrespective of locations now. “We are seeing about 80% increase in the quantum of work in this field (financial sector and consulting) fuelling growth in hiring in these sectors,” he said. However, while top B-schools have placed 100% of their batches, hiring has been impacted badly at B-class business schools that do not have a strong industry network, he added.

---||Patna||RJD’s Vidhan Sabha march turns violent as cops, protesters clash||PATNA: RJD workers led by the leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav hit the streets on Tuesday to carry out a protest march and gherao the state assembly over several issues, including unemployment, price rise and the contentious Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021. The march started from the JP roundabout near the Gandhi Maidan. The march led by Tejashwi was first stopped near Gandhi Maidan and then at the Dak Bungalow crossing, where heavy barricading and police deployment was done. It was here that the march till Vidhan Sabha, which was denied permission by the authorities, turned violent as the traffic circle turned into a battleground between party workers and the police. The clashes started around 11.30 pm and continued till beyond 2 pm. Tejashwi, his elder brother Tej Pratap and several senior party leaders, including Jagadanand Singh and Abdul Bari Siddiqui, were detained by the police to control the situation. City SP (central) Vinay Tiwari said RJD had sought permission for the march but was denied by the administration. “They were requested to stop at two points before Dakbungalow which they didn’t listen to. Finally, police had to use non-lethal force like water cannon. They could not have been allowed to cross Dakbungalow. It is not permissible as per regulations," the SP said. At least six persons, including Kotwali police station SHO Sunil Kumar Singh and three media persons, were allegedly injured in the stone-pelting by RJD workers after they were forcibly stopped from crossing the Dakbungalow roundabout. The SP claimed that RJD workers started pelting stones at police which left them with no choice but to use force. "Kotwali SHO and two other police personnel received injuries in the stone-pelting. No protestors appear to have any kind of injuries," he said. Traffic was thrown out of gear for more than three hours due to the clashes between RJD workers and police. Some vehicles were also damaged. More than 300 police personnel in protective gear with water cannons and riot control vehicles were deployed at the roundabout and surrounding areas because of the scheduled RJD march from JP roundabout towards Vidhan Sabha, which is in session. Tiwari said at least 50 people were arrested as a preventive action. "Several RJD leaders including leader of opposition Tejashwhi Yadav, former minister Tej Pratap Yadav courted arrest before police," he said. However, RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan denied the allegation made against RJD workers. “There are several videos in which it is clear how brutally the police were beating our party workers and many of them were hospitalized. It was a peaceful protest, but the police were all prepared to thrash us and that is why they had kept stones with them near Dak Bungalow. Their main targets were Tejashwi Ji and Tej Pratap Ji." RJD national secretary-general Abdul Bari Siddiqui, who was also detained, criticized the action taken by the police. He said, “Chief minister Nitish Kumar crossed all the limits today by suppressing the voice of people and using police force on a peaceful protest.” Meanwhile, senior RJD MLC Ram Chandra Purbey along with other RJD and Congress MLCs raised the issue of police lathi charge on protesters during the ongoing session of the assembly on Tuesday. RJD MLC Sunil Kumar Singh said the lathi-charge was done on people who were doing peaceful protest and requested the acting chairperson to consider this matter. Opposition MLCs continued anti-government slogan from their table, disrupting the functioning of the Upper House for some time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjds-vidhan-sabha-march-turns-violent-as-cops-protesters-clash/articleshow/81657783.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Now, the reports submitted by the education department will have to be cleared by the cabinet first, and on approval will have to be cleared by the state assembly,” sources in the education department said. “The education department had set up inspection committees comprising vice-chancellors of various universities, senior bureaucrats of the technical education department, college principals and other education experts. The inspection process has been under way for about the past six months,” the sources said. If these clearances come in time, these institutions will be able to admit students as private universities from this academic year, they added. One of three applicants from Surat is the Vanita Vishram Sanstha, which has been imparting education to women for 113 years. They intend to set up a Mahila University. Another century-old institution from Surat, the Sarvajanik Education Society, has also applied for university status. The third applicant from Surat is the Vidyadeep Trust. Other applicants are Babaria Institute, Vadodara; Shroff SR Rotary, Ankleshwar; Shivashish Trust, Surendranagar; Monarch Education Trust, Dehgam and Darshan Engineering College, Rajkot. There are presently about 50 private universities in the state, and their number is set to grow. In 2008, the Gujarat Technological University was set up, and was supposed to be the apex institution for technical education. Over time, as private universities are permitted to offer technical education, the number of colleges under it is decreasing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-may-get-7-new-pvt-varsities/articleshow/81657872.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Patna||Police Bill to protect people, will not be misused: Nitish Kumar||PATNA: The state assembly on Tuesday passed the Bihar Special Armed Police (BSAP) Bill, 2021, amid disorder and unruly scenes marked by deviation from the established parliamentary convention. When the proceedings started for the passage of the Bill, the state’s auxiliary police force jawans stood in the well of the House to block any obstruction from the opposition benches. The opposition, calling it the “black Bill”, had been pressing for its withdrawal all through the day, forcing the adjournment of the House five times. However, the leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav led the other opposition members out of the House. After they walked out, the Speaker also asked the jawans to leave the House. While energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav moved the Bill for its passage by the House and also gave the government’s reply, CM Nitish Kumar intervened to give general assurance to the people that its provisions will not be misused. “The Bill so passed for enactment into law will not harm the people of the state. Instead, it is meant to provide protection to them,” the CM said. “Its sections and sub-sections will act as check on the BSAP jawans and officials. The provisions are inbuilt and provide clauses for taking stringent administrative actions against those personnel who will violate its rules or misuse it. The rules provided for as a check on the officials and personnel are hard and not found in any law meant for policing anywhere.” The CM also said there was nothing new in the BSAP, as it was meant to merely change the name of existing Bihar Military Police (BMP), as the word ‘sainya’ (military) is not used as part of nomenclature for any police force.  Further, the governing rules of the BMP were framed in 1892, whose provisions needed to be updated in the new situation that has arisen in the state. “The BSAP jawans will be deployed to provide security to the industrial installations, besides to such installations as airport, metro rail and also places of tourist interest and their landmark temples, like Mahabodhi temple at Bodh Gaya. They will not perform any duty other than for which they are deployed, including to give protection to industrial units in extremists affected districts,” the CM said. Before the House met finally after the fifth adjournment late in the evening to pass the Bill, many of the opposition members were bodily lifted out of the House from its well, so that what remained of the opposition was hugely depleted in strength. Thanking the Speaker, the CM said, “I must thank you that you let the Bill be passed on the day for which it was fixed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/police-bill-to-protect-people-will-not-be-misused-nitish/articleshow/81657667.cms||Abhay Singh

While reviewing the status of the vaccination drive in Nalanda on Tuesday, district magistrate (DM) Yogendra Kumar Singh was told that altogether seven mobile Covid testing centres were set up at the Biharsharif, Rajgir and Islampur railway stations and different bus stands on March 17. They had collected as many as 10,354 samples in the last seven days, of which 10 were Covid positive. According to civil surgeon Dr Sunil Kumar, all the asymptomatic patients are under home isolation. As a precautionary measure, the Beedi Labour Hospital may also function as an isolation centre. “The health workers have exceeded the target of collecting and testing 1,300 samples every day,” Dr Sunil told this newspaper. Appreciating the efforts of the health workers in ensuring sample collection and timely distribution of reports, the DM asked the civil surgeon to conduct the vaccination drive effectively. Of the 14,548 health workers, who were inoculated in Phase I of the Covid vaccination drive in the district, only 10,532 took the second dose. The situation was worse in case of the frontline workers. While 8,451 of them took the first shot, only 2,776 showed up to receive their second shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nalanda-district-admn-tightens-vigil/articleshow/81656732.cms||Farrukh Nadim
---||Nagpur||‘Had lost hope, till a Mumbai relative helped find bed here’||A banker from Sadar lived anxious moments on Monday after he and his family members were unable to hospitalize his 84-year-old father, whose oxygen saturation level had slipped drastically to 74%. A score of at least 95% or higher is considered normal. The banker said his father had fever for three days and the family doctor asked them to get tested. Covid was detected on Sunday and the hunt for a hospital bed started from Monday morning, as his condition worsened. “Our doctors examined him and said he would need an ICU bed. The doctor first enquired at some big and small hospitals but no ICU beds were available there,” the banker said. Soon, the banker called up the NMC helpline and a couple of civic officials. “They told me to find a bed on my own as they were helpless. I had no option but to spread the word and posted messages on social media groups and among family and friends,” he said. Even as relatives and friends got busy with the search, the family began to lose hope. “I was almost shivering and my limbs went numb. Yet, I assured my mother that we will get a bed. Ultimately, a relative from Mumbai activated his sources here and helped us get a bed in a Wardhaman Nagar hospital,” he said. ‘Parents survived, wish brother could have been saved’ An elderly couple from Vaishali Nagar was discharged on Tuesday. They lost their elder son to Covid-19 on March 12, and had themselves tested positive later. The couple was forced to stay in home isolation for a couple of days as there was no one to shift them to hospital. Their younger son, a government employee, rushed to the city from Mumbai to attend to his ailing parents. On March 15, he enquired at a lot of hospitals and found one bed in Ajni area. Next day, he again went around the city looking for a bed for his father, whose infection had worsened. “Around evening, we reached a hospital at Wardhaman Nagar, where a patient was being discharged. I pleaded with the hospital staff to admit my father and fortunately they agreed,” he said, adding there was no help from the NMC helpline. The man said he was disheartened as his brother couldn’t be saved. “It hurts me that I couldn’t come before his condition deteriorated at home. He had fever ever since he returned after appearing in a competitive exam out of town,” he said. “Now my parents are fine. Both are in separate rooms and need care for another 5 to 10 days,” he said. ‘No bed in pvt or govt hosps, took sister to Kamptee’ An elderly man from Gorewada started searching for a bed around 6pm at Mankapur, where two private hospitals are treating Covid patients. “Both the hospitals expressed regret,” he said. On realizing that the situation was more or less same in private hospitals, the man drove his 64-year-old sister to IGGMCH as a last resort. “There too, doctors said beds were not available. There were more people needing hospitalization but they too were being asked to try elsewhere,” he said. The elderly man then asked his friends and relatives to search wherever they could. “Someone told us that a bed was available in a Kamptee hospital and we immediately rushed there to admit her. She is stable now,” he said. Before this, the man and his friend had made numerous calls to the NMC helpline, which turned out to be of no use. “They told us to make our own arrangements,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/had-lost-hope-till-a-mumbai-relative-helped-find-bed-here/articleshow/81657559.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Business||Your hard work may earn you a promotion this year||By M MuneerIt was next to impossible to get a promotion in the year 2020. With things looking brighter due to the vaccine drive and an improved economic scenario, even as the alphabets to describe the market curves are disputed, this year could augur well for promotion prospects. Now promotion need not define you, but it is a visible recognition. It’s not about working harder or meeting key performance indicators (KPIs). Often, it’s all about the right timing and boldly asking for it. People are anxious about being rejected and shy away from asking. Instead, use the opportunity to reframe the question for positive feedback on what could enable you to be promoted to a new role. Getting into the consideration set of potential candidates is itself a success — asking for it can only improve the chances. How best to prepare for popping the question? While experience, achievements and skills are important for a promotion, these are not enough. Here are some possible steps you can take, as gleaned from several senior executives who have found success: * Give what the company wants: Most companies want their employees to add more value than what they pay them. So, get involved in broader areas of the organisation to find ways to add more value for growth and profitability in this ‘Covid-lite’ year. Learn new skills that will broaden your ability to innovate, or find new ways to serve customers, reimagine processes or identify new units of business to reposition competition. * Influence the decision makers: Identify who could be the ultimate decision maker for your promotion. It could be your boss or his/her boss. Start building a relationship with this person by showcasing your work and ideas for future growth. You can ask this person in a subtle manner to mentor you, which will make him/her take special interest in you. Remember all this will work while you continue putting in hard hours and perform well. While asking for the promotion, be specific about what you want and why — absolutely no vagueness. * Network internally & externally: Evidence shows that networking is essential to career success. Author Ivan Misner says that people should spend 8-10 hours a week building professionally-relevant relationships. Sociologist Mark Granovetter finds that people tend to find jobs through others with whom they have only weak ties — people they may have met casually once or twice, saw infrequently or were more like casual acquaintances. The reason: Those who are tied strongly are more likely to have the same information and contacts, whereas the weakly-tied ones tend to have non-redundant information and contacts. Despite the new virtual work world, spend time liking the idea of networking within and outside of the company for that promotion by looking for opportunities where you can demonstrate your knowledge, offering to lead some new projects, taking regular informal feedbacks, or by projecting a personal brand that meaningfully stands out. * Establish yourself as a leader & problem-solver: Higher roles need more leadership skills, and these can be honed by becoming a role model for your colleagues and gaining their respect. This can be done by stepping in to lead teams when the need arises, by showing meticulous execution skills in projects, and by building skills that result in effective leadership. In addition, it is important to position yourself as a person to solve problems in crisis. Step in to take up critical initiatives that need problem-solving in business processes, people issues or diversity issues. Find areas that have bottlenecks such as productivity or workplace safety, for instance, and reverse the curve. Every company loves self-starters and you will have a clear edge if you take up problem areas without being asked for it and solve them. * Demonstrate strong work ethics: All said and done, performance matters most in the end. Creating the image of a hard worker with strong work ethics is key. A mastery of current position can be demonstrated by differentiating from your peers. Get better results, show excellence in what you do, and focus on execution and critical reasoning. In addition, be on time for work and meetings, especially on project deadlines while taking up extra initiatives that you believe in which, as mentioned earlier, has a link to creating value. Will it be easy to get a promotion this year? It won’t be hard for those who understand how the workplace has changed and for the agile who adapt. Face up to the challenges and follow the steps mentioned earlier. If you still don’t get that promotion, clearly your employer doesn’t deserve you.

As part of its CSR activity, Alkem on Tuesday sanctioned the purchase of two most advanced versions of the tele-therapy and brachytherapy units for this facility. Three mini cancer centres will connect cancer patients of those districts by telemedicine to the HBCHRC, Muzaffarpur. The three centres will also work with the district administration on community activities such as cancer awareness and screening. Radiotherapy is an essential part of any cancer hospital. As per WHO and International Atomic Energy Agency norms, one radiotherapy machine is required per million population. However, in Bihar, there are only half a dozen fully active radiotherapy centres to cater to the population of 104 million and all of them are located in the urban areas of Patna, read a press release shared by Tata Memorial Hospital. Commenting on the initiative, Alkem’s executive chairman Basudeo N Singh said, “Our overriding philosophy is to be recognised as a force for good in society. Through our corporate social responsibility endeavours, we aim to promote social and economic benefits for the financially vulnerable sections of the society and bring about a transformative change. I am very happy that our collaboration with TMC to establish an advanced radiotherapy facility and mini cancer units will help the people of Bihar and the adjoining states to better manage their cancer care treatment at an affordable cost.” TMC director Dr RA Badwe added, “Our mission is to offer affordable and accessible cancer care to one and all in India. The cancer centre in Muzaffarpur is the newest addition to our hospitals in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Sangrur, New Chandigarh, Guwahati and Visakhapatnam. This hospital will bring relief to the people of Bihar, who have to travel long distances and make huge expenses for cancer treatment. Addition of a radiotherapy block with the support of Alkem will help us enhance our capability to treat a larger number of patients with a short waiting time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/alkem-to-establish-mini-cancer-units-in-buxar-jehanabad-bhagalpur/articleshow/81657630.cms||---

Opening the conference, Anjani Kumar Singh, who is the nodal officer of the Bihar Museum and advisor to CM Nitish Kumar, said each session has been specially created to initiate a discourse around various aspects of museums around the world. In his keynote address, noted British art historian Neil MacGregor highlighted the shift in the concept of museums as an exhibition of objects from the past for educational benefits to museums as cultural institutions enhancing the understandings of the world. "Museums have a bigger role than just depicting and understanding our past. Its purpose is to help us understand the world and ourselves and make it a better place, a more just and equal place. More than anything, it plays a role in making us a global citizen," he said. Leonhard Emmerling (regional program director South-Asia, Goethe-Institute) spoke on comprehending cultural icons within the museum space. Paresh Maity (an independent artist) highlighted the impact of the pandemic on creative languages. Sabitha Satchi (art and literature critic and curator) spoke on museum as an open space for conversation while Shyam Sharma (former principal of College of Arts & Crafts, Patna) dwelt at length on Bihar Museum as an icon of hope, transformation and resilience. Rahul A Gore, associate member of the Indian Institute of Architects, while discussing the making of the Bihar Museum, said, "The museum constructed by a Japanese architectural firm was build to be the cultural centre of Bihar." Deborah Thiagarajan, the founder of Madras Craft Foundation, discussed the elements of a museum. "The contemporary museums need to ensure inclusivity and representation in terms of the audience and also in terms of whose history or story they choose to tell. Sensitising people through their own art should be the motive," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/museums-have-a-bigger-role-than-depicting-past/articleshow/81656748.cms||---

A Patna Meteorological Centre official said at 38.8 degrees C, Buxar was the hottest place in the state on Tuesday. Maximum temperature in Patna was recorded at 37.2 degrees C on Tuesday, three notches higher than normal for the day. Bhagalpur, on the other hand, sizzled at 38 degrees C. The official added maximum temperature would hover in the same range at least till Friday. “The change in weather is due to a western disturbance near Jammu and Kashmir, which has also led to formation of a cyclonic circulation over north-western Rajasthan. Another cyclonic circulation is situated over southern Chhatisgarh,” he said. Sanjay Kumar, a meteorologist at the Met office, said three weather systems in the region are together leading to moisture incursion in peninsular and western parts of the country, but their impact is not much felt in Bihar. “The moisture incursion amid high temperature is leading to Nor’wester activities, including thundercloud formation in western states like Rajasthan. However, Bihar is not getting much impact of such weather conditions,” he said. World Meteorological Day:A deliberation session was held at Patna Meteorological Centre on Tuesday on the occasion of World Meteorological Day. The event was chaired by director of the Met centre Vivek Kumar Sinha. Pradhan Parth Sarthi, professor at department of environmental science of Central University of South Bihar (CUSB), was the chief speaker. As per a statement issued by the meteorological centre, the initial reports of the Covid-19 task force of World Meteorological Organisation suggested that Covid-19 pandemic would for a long time in cold and dry weather conditions. In another report, it has been stated that the emission of carbon dioxide was 17% during the peak lockdown period in 2020 as compared to 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mercury-to-rise-further-met/articleshow/81656622.cms||---
---||Patna||Academics welcome HC’s stay on fresh admissions in law colleges||PATNA: The Patna high court’s decision to stay fresh admission of students in all the law colleges has raised a question mark on the quality of legal education being imparted in the state. Most of these colleges have been functioning without fulfilling the requirements of faculty strength and infrastructural facilities. As per the inspection report submitted by the Bar Council of India (BCI) team, all the 28 law institutions, except Chanakya National Law University (CNLU), failed to meet the council’s guidelines. More than two-thirds of the required posts of teachers are lying vacant for the last several years in these colleges. Only 134 teachers are working against 584 sanctioned posts. More surprisingly, at least three law colleges do not have even a single regular faculty and eight colleges are running without qualified principals. Needless to say, most law colleges, including the oldest Patna Law College, have been facing derecognition from BCI due to lack of teachers and infrastructural facilities. “In 111-year-old Patna Law College, the number of teachers has not been satisfactory for the last several years and the infrastructural facilities have also remained the same despite considerable increase in number of students. Classrooms in the college were originally supposed to accommodate only 60 students, but now they have to accommodate 300 students. The number of sanctioned posts of teachers has also not been enhanced for the last several decades,” said Vani Bhushan, a senior teacher of PU law faculty. Patna University vice-chancellor G K Chaudhary said the PU has sent to the state university service commission three vacancies of law teachers for appointment. Since the university cannot create posts on its own, it is managing teaching work with the help of guest faculties, he said. Patna Law College’s former principal Rakesh Verma appreciated the stand of Patna high court and observed that the minimum requirements of faculty and infrastructure must be fulfilled by law colleges if the standard of legal education is to be raised. Meanwhile, senior teachers of education faculty pointed out some senior anomalies in the appointment of 478 teachers in district institutes of education and training (DIETs), all of which were scrapped by the Patna high court. State president of Indian Association of Teacher Education and PU senate member, Kumar Sanjeev, said at the time of advertisement it was mentioned that 2.5 times the number of vacancies the candidates would be called for interview by the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC), but the number of candidates called for interview was just 1.9%. “Moreover, 39 posts meant for candidates coming under inclusive education were also treated as general seats. Reservation roster was also not followed properly in appointments,” he alleged. He hailed the verdict of high court in cancelling all these appointments and expressed the hope that justice would be granted to the deserving candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/academics-welcome-hcs-stay-on-fresh-admissions-in-law-colleges/articleshow/81656516.cms||B K Mishra

The tribal woman's half-naked body was found at Pratappur village on the banks of the Triveni under Semra police station in West Champaran district on March 18, four days after she went missing on her way home after taking the examination. Dr A K Tiwari, who headed the medical board that conducted the autopsy, said the victim's private parts were mutilated, which hinted at the involvement of more than one accused. "The victim was sexually assaulted before being killed," the doctor said, adding, the swabs have been sent to the forensic science laboratory for test for identifying the semen stains," Dr Tiwari told this newspaper. He said, "It's not possible that one man raped and murdered the victim simultaneously. Her face was also disfigured by the accused to avoid detection of her identity. The autopsy report has been sent to the police." The incident has sparked protests in the sub-divisional town ever since the body of the girl was found. Women activists of different political and social organisations took out a candle march demanding capital punishment for the accused. Bagaha SP Kiran Kumar Jadhav said the SHOs of Semra and Chiutaha police stations have been issued show-cause notices for negligence and delay in the investigation. The deceased's family had alleged that the police lodged a missing complaint two days later. Jadhav, however, said the accused Baitha was arrested and forwarded to jail. The auto-rickshaw driver, a resident of Kathakuyian village, has confessed to the crime. The incident took place when she was returning home in an auto-rickshaw after writing her examination for the constable's post. Meanwhile, the district welfare officer, Upendra Singh, provided a cheque for Rs 4,12,500 as compensation to the deceased's family under the provisions of the SC/ST (Prevention) of Atrocities Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/autopsy-hints-at-role-of-more-than-one-person-in-tribal-girls-rape-murder/articleshow/81656496.cms||Tirthraj Kushwaha

The education department has prepared an estimate of Rs 3.84 crore for compensation and sent the same to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to ensure fresh construction of the school buildings. The school buildings identified for demolition include primary schools at Beladih, Pali and Pranpur and a high school at Hargawan in Belaganj block. Middle schools at Baiju Bigha, Matihani and Turi Kala in Bodh Gaya and Karmauni in Dobhi block would also be demolished. Regional deputy director (education), Magadh division, Ramsagar Prasad Singh said as per the provision of the government, land has to be identified at nearest location where the school building exists. “The department has sent an estimate to NHAI for compensation. The school buildings will be constructed after the compensation amount is made available,” he added. Gaya DM Abhishek Singh has asked the circle officers (COs) concerned to identify land for fresh construction of school buildings. Sources said the land identification is in progress and it would be finalised soon. Meanwhile, at a review meeting held recently, the DM asked the COs and the block education officers to identify land for construction of 85 other schools in different blocks of the district. These schools do not have their own buildings yet. The proposed demolition of 10 schools, however, has not gone down well with locals. Mahesh Sharma, a social activist from Belaganj, said, “Studies of students were hit last year when all the schools remained closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Besides, Gaya remains one of the hottest places in the state during summer. If fresh construction of school buildings is not ensured before demolition, students will have to face hardship due to heat wave condition during summer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nh-30-widening-10-schools-to-be-razed-rebuilt-in-gaya/articleshow/81656470.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Experts suspect coronavirus mutation at play in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Coronavirus has Gujarat in its vicious grip once again. In 24 hours ending 5 pm on Tuesday, the state added 1,730 cases – record high daily cases reported in the pandemic yet -- taking the total to 2.9 lakh. In a week, the state has registered an alarming rise of 81% in cases with an addition of total 10,328. In the preceding week, 5,529 cases were recorded. City-based experts say there is reason to suspect a mutation might be at play in Ahmedabad which recorded 502 cases in a day, the highest for any city in the state during the pandemic – and state at large. Dr Tushar Patel, a city-based pulmonologist and member of the state task force on Covid-19, said that the surge could only be understood in terms of mutation. “If we compare the profile of the patients in the past fortnight with those in the post-Diwali period, the severity and mortality is low. But the spread is much higher – something that is being observed in other parts of the country and elsewhere in the world,” he said. Dr Maharshi Desai, a city-based critical care specialist and fellow task force member, said that the patients are younger compared to the past surge. “They are out for their jobs and the movement among the working population is higher. There is no data available for Gujarat but mutation could not be ruled out,” he said. He added that fewer patients are requiring hospitalization during this surge due to milder symptoms. City-based pathologists are pointing at missing S-gene from several of the RT-PCR tests. Explaining its importance and meaning, Dr Urvesh Shah, professor of pathology at GCS Medical College, said that the kit tests the sample based on S, N and E genes along with RdRp gene. “The kits detect the presence of two, three or all four genes based on its sensitivity. The experience we have in Ahmedabad at several of the labs indicate that S-gene is not found, but as other genes are present, the person is tested positive,” said Dr Shah. “We can interpret the result as mutation on the S gene – as the kits are designed based on the earlier variant.” “Most of the positive cases are showing ‘S’ gene negative. This signifies the possibility of mutation in the `S’ gene in the new strain,” said Dr Bhavini Shah, consultant histopathologist and infection prevention and control specialist. Dr DG Patel, a city-based pathologist, agreed with the theory. “Last year, patients gave history of severe symptoms in terms of fever, breathlessness or body ache. This month, symptoms are more cold-like symptoms or pain in the throat. Due to less severity, patients do not become aware of carrying the virus which explains it spread to most family members,’ he said. Dr Patel added that neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) along with C-reactive protein (CRP) used to be high in the Covid-19 positive patients. “The general range was 100-150. But for the past few days, we don’t see it beyond 50-60. Thus, we can say that the severity is less,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/experts-suspect-coronavirusmutation-at-play-in-gujarat/articleshow/81657861.cms||Parth Shastri

Police claimed they were trying to stop the car driver after seeing him and other occupants not wearing masks, but he tried to flee. Video of the incident has gone viral on social media. Later, both the parties reached a compromise and no FIR was registered, said the police. Times ViewIt is the prime duty of a law enforcement official to uphold the law and not to break it. The police force needs to sensitize cops on what's the right behaviour while dealing with the public, even if the person in question has apparently flouted a rule. If the passengers were without masks, they were in the wrong, but that was no excuse for the cop to act in such a dangerous fashion.Mohit Sharma, a resident of Hallomajra, was returning home with his mother and two sisters in the car. As they reached near the beatbox in Ram Darbar, two cops standing on the road signalled the car to stop. Mohit said after seeing the cops, he slowed down and was parking on the roadside when one of the cops started hitting the windscreens with a stick. He smashed the rear windscreen completely and the front windscreen was also partially damaged. Car occupants were not injured in the incident. Mohit called up at 112 and other cops from Sector 31 police station also reached the spot. Passersby gathered at the spot and started recording the incident on their mobile phones. They later circulated it on social media. The footage shows a sister of the car driver saying that the cop was smashing the windscreen and shards were falling on her. The complainant said his uncle also worked with the UT police and was deputed at Sector 31 police station. The erring cop felt sorry and said he was ready to compensate for the damages. The complainant and the accused cop then struck a compromise. DSP Charanjit Singh Virk, UT Police PRO, said no FIR was registered as the complainant gave in writing that he did not want any action against anyone.

He had promised to marry her on the trip, and coerced her into a relationship. Gedam, a native of Chandrapur district, had come to the city to prepare for competitive examinations. The victim was later surprised to learn that Gedam had got engaged with another woman last year. She had gone and met the woman, following which the engagement was called off. Gedam had once again got engaged to yet another woman this year, after which the victim had decided to lodge a complaint against him. Police said Gedam and the victim, both preparing for competitive examinations, had met each other while studying together at a library. They had befriended each other in February 2019. Initially, they had just exchanged cellphone numbers and used to speak on the phone but later started dating each other. Gedam and the woman had been going around in the city at different places before they planned the visit to Shegaon. Police said the two had gone to Shegaon by bus from Ganeshpeth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/girlfriend-accuses-man-of-rape-after-he-gets-engaged-to-another-girl/articleshow/81657581.cms||Soumitra Bose

The issue led to a furore at a BEST committee meeting on Tuesday, where members demanded withdrawal of the order. Those facing action are mainly bus drivers and conductors. Senior committee member Sunil Ganacharya said, “The drivers and conductors later joined duties and served citizens risking lives. Many were absent for genuine reasons, but were charge-sheeted. An inquiry was conducted and now all have been declared guilty and punished. This is unwarranted.” BJP member and councillor Prakash Gangadhare alleged that officers too were absent but no action was taken.A traffic wing official justified the action. Committee chairman Pravin Shinde (Shiv Sena) said drivers and conductors should be pardoned.

---||Chennai||Chennai: Covid surge puts spotlight on crowding||CHENNAI: The spike in cases has put the focus back on public places and crowding. While the state has ruled out a complete lockdown for now, officials are working to bring down cases without affecting the economy. At an expert medical committee meeting on Tuesday, officials analysed reasons for the surge and planned a road map to curb the spread of Covid-19 and strengthen Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for workplaces. A statement from chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan after the meeting said malls and mulitplexes would be subject to further restrictions if they do not strictly adhere to the guidelines. The expert committee said ‘Covid fatigue’ had set in among the public, resulting in violation of Covid rules. This has led to the surge in cases and clusters. It advised the state to expedite the vaccination drive. “Ever since we resumed operations after lockdown, we have been following the SOPs as advised by the government. We have not slackened in between and will continue to follow them,” said a spokesperson for The Chennai Silks in T Nagar, the shopping hub of the city. Several establishments have set up speakers broadcasting mask compliance and social distancing reminders. “Many large establishments have already shut some branches due to revenue loss and it is only in our best interests if we follow all SOPs,” the spokesperson said. Phoenix market city and Palladium, Velachery, has adhered to all mandated SOPs since re-opening, said mall director Pooja Patti. “Additionally, we are also taking preventive steps and working with the Chennai corporation to vaccinate our frontliners. Today, our retail partners and staff received their first Covaxin shot,” said Patti. Social distancing norms are often flouted in spaces like Marina beach and at political campaigns. Officials also have a close eye on cinema halls and multiplexes, where people gather in a closed environment for at least three hours. “We have been following all government rules till date across the state. Sanitisers, temperature checks, social distancing, wearing masks — all the requisite conditions are fulfilled,” said Tiruppur M Subramaniam, president, Tamil Nadu Theatre and Multiplex Owners’ Association. Unlike companies, colleges and schools where contacts can be traced, it is difficult to conduct such an exercise in public spaces. Hence, the onus lies with the organisers, establishment managers and the public themselves to follow norms, said a city corporation official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/covid-surge-puts-spotlight-on-crowding/articleshow/81657576.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Kukatpally noisiest area in 7 metros||HYDERABAD: Despite vehicles being off the roads and people remaining cooped up in their houses through most of 2020 due to Covid-19 induced lockdown, Kukatpally was the noisiest place among seven metro cities, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data presented in the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha recently. As per the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, the maximum noise level in silent, residential, commercial and industrial areas should be 50, 55, 65 and 75 decibels (dB) respectively during day time (6 am to 10 pm) and 40, 45, 55 and 70 dB respectively during night time (10.01 pm to 5.59 am). Last year, the highest noise level recorded at Kukatpally was 77 dB during daytime and 73 during night time. Noise in Kukatpally, which falls under the commercial zone, was a few notches higher than the average noise level allowed in industrial areas throughout the day. Kukatpally was noisier than Delhi’s ITO and Mumbai’s Andheri which recorded day-time noise of 75 dB and 72 dB and night-time noise of 73 db and 70 dB respectively. Kukatpally houses several small scale industries which residents rue are major contributors to the noise pollution levels. “There are steel and iron, heavy metal units which constantly make the cutting sound. There are lot of educational institutions around Kukatpally due to which there is always heavy traffic and indiscriminate honking,” said Sai Teja, a resident of Kukatpally. Officials attributed the rise in noise pollution to increased commercial activities in the area. “The Sanathnagar to Kukatpally belt is a busy area which not only houses a lot of small scale industries but also has a lot of buzzing commercial activities, especially in residential areas. This has resulted in a rise in noise pollution in the area,” said an official from the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB). Other areas such as Abids, Punjagutta, Secunderabad also recorded high noise levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kukatpally-noisiest-area-in-7-metros/articleshow/81658511.cms||Preeti Biswas

With the assembly elections approaching and rise in Covid-19 cases along with mosquito menace, the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation authorities has a lot on its plate. TOI noticed garbage, dry leaves and other construction waste piling up on roadside corners of the township. Garbage and litter could also be seen piling up on the green verge on the Kestopur canal side, beside some government offices like Purta Bhavan, Mayukh Bhavan and places surrounding Central Park. According to locals the wastes are not being properly disposed off regularly. Residents said that the civic body should continue providing its daily services including cleaning and disposal of the generated waste. “Heaps of garbage are piling up on places off the canal side road which is creating a mess and look ugly. The civic authorities should see that the daily generated waste is regularly cleaned, as the accumulated garbage can also lead to breeding of mosquitoes,” said Sankhadeep Roy Chowdhury, a resident of AE block residing close to the Kestopur canal side road. “The cleaning of garbage is a continuous process and should not be affected because of elections being round the corner. The citizens pay taxes for that. Moreover, being a satellite township its sanctity should be maintained,” said Tamal Pal, a resident of HB block. The civic authorities during the tenure of the board of councillors had come up with a systematic waste disposal system which seems to have lately slackened to some extent. Devashis Jana, who was previously the Bidhannagar MMIC (waste management) and then a member of the board of administrators before resigning and joining the BJP said that the waste disposal system in Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation area of Salt Lake and Rajarhat has deteriorated over the past few weeks due to lack of daily supervision. Officials of the civic body’s conservancy department however said that daily disposal of the township’s waste was being carried out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/roadside-litter-lack-of-cleaning-leave-salt-lake-residents-fuming/articleshow/81657571.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Delhi||Three call centres duping foreigners busted in Delhi, 37 held||NEW DELHI: Police have arrested 37 people and busted three fake call centres that were duping foreign nationals by posing as law enforcement officials and threatening to freeze their bank accounts. The accused also pretended to be technical support staff from Amazon and Apple while conning foreigners. While two call centres were being run from Janakpuri, one operated from Bindapur. Police learnt about the scam and conducted a raid, and took into custody 37 persons, including managers, supervisors and operators. Nine of them were working at the Bindapur call centre and 28 at the Janakpuri centres. A total of 56 desktops and 41 phones were seized from the three locations, police said. Anyesh Roy, DCP (Cyber Cell), disclosed that the victims of the scam being operated from the Bindapur call centre were people residing in foreign countries. During interrogation by the cops, the accused admitted to conning people of over Rs 10 crore. “They used to call people posing as officials of law enforcement agencies,” Roy said. “On the basis of their Social Security Number, they would threaten the victims with freezing their bank accounts on the ground that these accounts were found indulging in transactions with drug cartels. Once the targets were convinced their accounts were being fraudulently used, the accused asked them to either face legal action or buy Bitcoins or Google gift cards and transfer the money into their account.” The DCP said that the call centres operating from Janakpuri also targeted foreign nationals while pretending to be the technical support staff from Apple or Amazon. “They would tell the customers that their device had been compromised or had been used to make some unauthorised purchases. Then on the pretext of helping them, the scammers would take down their account details and siphon money from the accounts,” revealed Roy. “The accused confessed they had duped people to the tune of Rs 5 crore.” Police have also found that each caller was paid Rs 25,000-30,000 per month as salary, while the team leaders and closers got a monthly sum of Rs 60,000-75,000. The manager received around Rs 1 lakh a month. In addition to this, all employees were paid incentives. For every US dollar they managed to scam, the caller got Rs 2 and the team leader or the closer Rs 4 as incentive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-call-centres-duping-foreigners-busted-37-held/articleshow/81658520.cms||---

---||Nagpur||NMC permits midday meals dry ration distribution||Nagpur: While schools will continue to remain closed in Nagpur city till at least March 31, distribution of dry rations under the Midday Meals (MDM) scheme has been permitted by civic authorities. Since last year, Maharashtra government has been distributing dry rations to all eligible students, as cooking food on campus is not allowed as part of Covid-19 safety protocols. Gautam Gedam, district in-charge for MDM scheme said, “On Tuesday we received a letter from Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), permitting us to go ahead with dry ration distribution. We will now be calling students, to their respective schools at a specific time, to collect the ration kits.” He said schools have been doing this since last year, so the system is already in place. “What happened was that Nagpur went under a lockdown earlier this month. That was a major cause for concern for all of us because we could not keep delaying it. So discussions were on with NMC on how we can go about the ration distribution. Today we received the permission and from Wednesday, schools will start distribution,” said Gedam. But schools will have to advise their local police station about this in advance. This has been done so that police officials and even the civic authorities are aware that people will be coming to campus for collecting dry rations. Students of Std I to VIII, studying in government or grant-in-aid schools, are eligible for the MDM scheme. Gedam said since last year only dry rations are being given. “The pandemic forced schools to be shut down last year. Since then, dry rations are being handed out to students,” he said. Though schools have started in many districts now, due to safety reasons, food is not being cooked and served.” Gedam said, “For our MDM ration kits, students are being given raw rice, dal (masoor) and chana. The distribution modalities depend on the type of MDM being implemented at a particular school. Some are under centralized kitchen, while others have school kitchen.” He added that for those under centralized kitchen, wherein a common contractor supplies food to a group of schools, there had been a backlog. “Due to some tendering issues, ration kits could not be supplied earlier. But now that the tender has been awarded, the supply has started,” said Gedam. The quantity of ration being doled out depends on a few factors. Rice is allotted according to weight, whereas pulses and chana are given according to certain fixed rate. Gedam said, “For students of Std I to V, we give 100 gram rice per day. The quantity increases to 150 gram per day for students of Std VI to VIII.” For dal and chana, the government fixes an average price at which the items are to be procured and distributed. “Average price for over 200-day range has been fixed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-permits-midday-meals-dry-ration-distribution/articleshow/81656408.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Chennai||No ‘universal’ vax drive, stick to priority group: Corporation to officials||CHENNAI: Greater Chennai Corporation on Tuesday morning issued a communique to zonal level officials reiterating that the Covid vaccination drive has not been universalised and instructed officials to ensure that only eligible citizens are given shots. TOI had reported that many Primary Health Centres (PHCs) were following universal vaccination to avoid wastage. Several messages began doing the rounds on social media and instant messaging platforms that the corporation has approved universal vaccination. Following these texts, many turned up at PHCs for their shots. However, centres that had been administering doses to those below 45 till Monday, turned down ineligible people on Tuesday, members of the public said. A few PHCs in the city continued to offer shots to everyone aged 18 and above. The corporation’s social media handles quickly moved to refute the universal vaccination messages. It labelled them as ‘fake news’ and said, “Wait for your turn to get vaccinated.” In the communication issued on Tuesday, the corporation pointed out that frontline workers now included market vendors, shopkeepers, maids, hotel staff and auto drivers. However, people in these categories should be vaccinated in targeted camps, it said. “For instance, spot vaccination can be done in a market area to cover all vendors,” the communique said. Similarly such drives should also be conducted in gated communities to cover house maids. The corporation forbade vaccinations for ‘extended’ frontline workers at Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs) or mini clinics if they were under the age of 45.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-universal-vax-drive-stick-to-priority-grp-corpn-to-officials/articleshow/81657592.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

---||Kochi||Kerala assembly elections: NYAY will be ‘tested’, says Rahul Gandhi||KOTTAYAM: AICC leader Rahul Gandhi said that the NYAY scheme, which has been proposed in the UDF manifesto, will be tested in Kerala if the UDF is elected to power and would be taken to other Congress-rules state if it succeeds here. NYAY (Nyuntam Aay Yojana) is a minimum income guarantee scheme which the Congress party hopes to implement. It was first unveiled during the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “I have a selfish reason to test it,” Gandhi said, addressing an election corner meeting organised in the Puthuppally assembly constituency represented by former chief minister and senior Congress leader Oommen Chandy for the last 50 years. Flanked by Chandy and AICC general secretary K C Venugopal on a roofless campaign vehicle, Gandhi said he was confident of the success of the NYAY scheme. “We need to put money into people’s hands. The NYAY scheme offers this and if the UDF is voted back to power the people of the state are going to get it,” he added. It will be a key initiative to revive the economy. If a family gets Rs 6,000 per month and Rs 72,000 per annum, this will come to the market and revive the economy, which will increase production and create jobs. This is not a favour or charity but is the only way to revive the economy, he said. “We are testing this new idea in Kerala and I am confident about its success. If it works out here, it will be taken to the rest of the states where Congress is ruling. Kerala is going to show the rest of the country how to fight poverty,” Gandhi said. In its manifesto for the April 6 assembly polls, the Congress-led UDF has promised a Rs 2,000 ‘pension’ for homemakers, Rs 72,000 annually to the poor under the NYAY Yojana and five lakh homes for the underprivileged. Gandhi assured that if UDF comes back to power a minimum price of Rs 250 per kg for rubber will be ensured. “The Congress-led government will see to it that rubber farmers get their right due. Ensuring Rs 250 per kg for rubber is also an important step to revive the economy, because it is one of the most important things of this area,” he added. He said that Congress is following the economics which is based on practical knowledge, and pointed out the success of the MGNREG scheme brought by the UPA government that revived the rural economy. Gandhi, who addressed party workers in Kottayam, Puthuppally, Kanjirappally, Pala and Kaduthuruthy assembly constituencies, criticized chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan for turning a blind eye towards the protests of the PSC rank holders in front of the Secretariat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nyay-will-be-tested-in-kerala-rahul/articleshow/81657615.cms||---
---||Delhi||Patriots come alive at light and sound show||New Delhi: A special light and sound show, musical play and cultural programmes depicting the freedom struggle and martyrdom of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev left the crowd enthralled at Central Park, Connaught Place, on Tuesday. The event titled ‘Ek Sham Shaheedon K Naam’ was organised to pay tribute to the three freedom fighters on their death anniversary. A photo gallery on the life of Bhagat Singh was installed in the park. A set of four books on the life of Singh was distributed to the public. On the occasion, some freedom fighters were invited and kin of Singh too participated. The event was part of the ‘Freedom@75 celebrations’ announced by the Delhi government. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai, who was present in the event, said, “Through this light and sound show, I want all of you to become familiar with patriots like Shaheed Bhagat Singh. During India’s freedom movement, there were two schools of thought. The one that used to appease the British rulers for their own benefits and was against the growth of India. The second school that wanted equal rights and freedom for all. This school wanted a new India--one that is free and believes in equality.” While addressing the crowd, Rai said, “When we talk about Shaheed Bhagat Singh, we talk about the parliament attack but we need to remember that following the principles of Gandhi Ji, Singh also did Satyagraha. Shaheed Bhagat Singh and others held the longest hunger strike in prison. At the same time, Gandhi Ji adopted Bhagat Singh’s concept of Poorna Swaraj.” Rai said though Bristishers have gone but there is another type of autocratic power in India. “We have a government today that puts up nails in front of farmers. A government is scared of students, farmers, labourers and others. These people in power continuously attack the students, farmers and any person who criticises them. We need to learn from freedom fighters who fought against the Britishers. We need to learn from Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru and others on how we can fight against arrogant and autocratic power. Our struggle today is that of upholding democracy, equality, diversity, humanity and other principles of our nation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/patriots-come-alive-at-light-and-sound-show/articleshow/81658531.cms||---

---||Nagpur||‘Absent students from online classes won’t be promoted’||NAGPUR: Independent English Schools Association (IESA), a Pune-based association of budget schools of state board with pan-Maharashtra presence, has unanimously decided to stop automatic promotion of all students who fell into the “absent” category. The decision to this effect was taken at its meeting where 4,000 schools, mostly the association members, have decided to support the decision of not promoting students to next class if they have been “consistently absent” from online/ofline classes. The association’s decision has, however, started getting flak from allround when one of the members of parents’ association, reacting to this, said he is not convinced with the idea of not promoting students to the next class. “I think this is nothing but an alibi of collecting full pending fee from parents,” Yogesh Pathare, national coordinator of Rashtriya Shikshak Palak Sanghatan, said. Even the current law prohibits schools to hold back students in the same class till Std VIII. If the student fails in the exam then a reexam has to be taken after remedial classes but they can’t be held back at any cost.  IESA president Rajendra Dayma, a trustee of school in Jalna district, said, “We have noticed that between 10-15% students have not attended classes at all. Even though online classes were going on, such students neither attended the classes nor did their parents respond to any communication by schools. Promoting such students to a higher class will be detrimental for them.” Dayma further said, “The students who do not have any foundational base of previous class, how can they be promoted to the next class? There’s an entire year’s academic gap. The child won’t be able to cope with the new concepts being taught in the next class.” He also shared an experience of a member school of last week, which prompted them to think about this issue. “A parent had stopped communication with the school since August 2020. His child did not attend even a single class, even though online facility was available. But last week the parent came and said that the child had been home-schooled and is ready to appear for final examination of school,” Dayma said while quoting the parent. The school refused to allow the child to appear for the final examinations. “These are the reasons the association decided to take the tough stance. Parents must understand that trying to push their kids without any strong base is going to be harmful for them in future,” Dayma said. He also clarified majority of these parents happen to be those who have not paid fees. Dayma said, “Now, many of them are coming back saying take 25-40% of the fee but allow their kids to sit for final examinations. But it’s not about the fee issue at all, it’s unethical for us to allow any student to appear for a final exam without them having attended any classes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/absent-students-from-online-classes-wont-be-promoted/articleshow/81657597.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The minister said Rs1 crore out of the total Rs5 crore sanctioned for the purpose has been released. Using the funds, the administration should construct a Bal Bhavan for women, including single mothers, in the district. “Government-sponsored schemes should be implemented effectively to ensure job opportunities for every single mother locally. Such beneficiaries should be trained in various skills so that they can start own entrepreneurial units to earn livelihood,” said Thakur. As per official record, there are 91 single mothers in the district and the highest number is in Zari Jamni tehsil, which is a tribal belt. A nodal officer has been deputed to monitor the rehabilitation activities being carried out in remote tribal areas.

---||Vadodara||Homage to martyrs sullied in clashes||Vadodara: Clashes between two student groups — belonging to different political ideologies — outside the unit building of M S University’s Faculty of Commerce, marred a function which was organized to pay homage to and unveil the busts of martyrs Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru on Tuesday. Student leaders linked with the All Gujarat Students Union (AGSU) and the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) clashed before the homage function. The warring groups first entered into heated arguments, later resorted to sloganeering after which they entered into a full-fledged scuffle in presence of university’s vigilance staff. It was only after cops arrived that the crowd was dispersed and the scuffle ended. According to MSU Students Union general secretary Rakesh Panjabi, they had received permission from the university authorities to conduct the function. Panjabi said that they were allowed to hold the function but with limited attendance — 15 persons — due to Covid-19 restrictions. Panjabi alleged that ABVP student leaders reached the spot to disrupt the programme. “Former commerce faculty general secretary Kashyap Thakkar had saved some amount from his funds so that busts of the martyrs could be installed at the faculty. It is after a gap of five long years and after so many obstacles that the busts were unveiled. But certain elements want to keep creating hurdles,” said Panjabi.ABVP leaders on the other hand alleged that AGSU and leaders linked with it want to create an impression that the entire university campus is under their control. “We simply wanted to pay tributes to the freedom fighters but we were stopped from doing so,” said a student leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/homage-to-martyrs-sullied-in-clashes/articleshow/81656651.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Passengers who cancelled flights during lockdown may receive their refunds next week||Mumbai: Passengers who have not yet received a refund for domestic flights cancelled last summer during the lockdown should get them next week if the Supreme Court order passed in October last year is honoured by airlines and travel agents. The matter pertains to flights cancelled from March 25 to May 25, for which airlines had moved the booking amount into credit shells for later use. A Supreme Court order stated that Indian carriers in financial distress can hold the refund amount in credit shell till March 31, 2021. If the passenger hasn’t used the credit shell by March end, the airline shall refund cash. For international bookings, the amount had to be passed on to the passenger within 15 days of the court’s October order, by the airline/travel agent. Last December, the government said that airlines had refunded almost three-fourth of such tickets. But many passengers still have no clarity on the status of their refund even as the date mentioned in the SC order looms close. Mumbai resident Ashley Lewis is yet to receive a refund for Rs 30,400 he paid to online travel portal Makemytrip for three Mumbai-Kochi return tickets on Air India for travel in May. Rajshree Anand had paid Rs 15,000 to Yatra.com and booked tickets for May 2020 from Mumbai to Goa on GoAir and return on Air India. “We sent a refund request to Yatra several months ago. When I log into their app, it says the refund request is in process and they are yet to receive it from the airline,” she said. Then, there are those who received the refund, but only after putting up a fight. For over two hours on January 26, Shama (name changed on request) rallied on WhatsApp with a SpiceJet customer care official over refund for Rs 12,600, the amount she had spent in December 2019 to buy three domestic tickets for travel on March 31 last year. TOI sent a questionnaire to major Indian carriers last week. A GoAir spokesperson said that the airline was “in compliance with the Supreme Court ruling and DGCA guidelines for bookings and cancellations during the lockdown period.” A SpiceJet spokesperson said: “Refunds are governed by the order of the Supreme Court and we are adhering to those directions. SpiceJet has already written to its travel partners and agents to share details of pending credit shell PNRs so that the airline can immediately reverse the credit shell amount back to the agency ID.” A Vistara spokesperson said that the airline was in compliance with the Supreme Court order. An Air India spokesperson said: “Due to complete stoppage of flights during the lockdown, the revenue stream was severely impacted... The ticket refunds are being processed through Air India’s own offices within pre-assigned budgeted amounts. The refunds are progressively increasing with the increase in revenue of the company.” TOI also sent questionnaires to major online travel agents two weeks ago, but most declined to respond, others haven’t responded yet. An official from a travel agents’ association said that most agents had refunded, but different agents have different norms. Amount paid for low fares might be in credit shell due to the conditions attached, he said. Advocate Shirish Deshpande of Mumbai Grahak Panchayat said: “A travel agent/online travel portal is an intermediary between the passenger and the airline. The SC has given directions to airlines to refund the amount and so the travel agent, in turn, has to pass that refund to the customer. Retaining the amount in a credit shell is a violation of the Supreme Court order. It’s actually transgressing the order and they will invite contempt.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/passengers-who-cancelled-flights-during-lockdown-may-receive-their-refunds-next-week/articleshow/81659147.cms||---

DRI arrested three persons, identified as Vinod Kushwa, Vijay Goel and Satyaveer Singh, and said the gold was possibly headed towards poll-bound Chennai. “The accused were acting as mules and have been booked under Customs Act. They are natives from Delhi and have been produced in court,” a source said. The vehicle bearing Assam registration number started from Kolkata and was going to Chennai after a halt in Hyderabad to avoid getting caught. The seizure was done at Panthangi toll plaza. Sources in DRI said the origin of gold was probably Switzerland, but the markings on the gold were partially erased and the entire consignment was stashed inside the dashboard. The accused failed to produce any documents. DRI has been tracking gold smuggling due to elections in several states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dri-seizes-25-kg-gold-from-vehicle-on-way-to-tamil-nadu/articleshow/81658534.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Chennai||Kabasura Kudineer makes a comeback||Chennai: The surge in cases has led to Siddha concoction, Kabasura Kudineer, making a comeback after two months. Sales have increased by 70% to 90%, city retailers said. For instance, IMPCOPS store in Thiruvanmiyur sold 30 to 40 bottles (100g) of Kabasura Kudineer powder every week last month. Now, it sells nearly 100 bottles every week. A 100g bottle is priced at Rs 120-Rs 150 in Chennai. Tamil Nadu Medicinal Plant Farms and Herbal Medicine Corporation Limited (TAMPCOL), a state undertaking that has been supplying the concoction to all district hospitals and Greater Chennai Corporation since March 2020, is set to increase production in case the demand spikes further in the coming days. So far, over 400 tonnes of the powder has been distributed. An average of 15,000kg of Kabasura Kudineer powder is manufactured at units in Chennai and Pudukottai, said TAMPCOL managing director S Ganesh, adding that TAMPCOL has streamlined raw material supply to ensure that monthly production can be increased up to 25,000kg if necessary. Meanwhile, National Institute of Siddha in Chennai, which provided the concoction to more than two lakh patients last year, is also readying to increase its supply scale. The institute initiated studies to prove the prophylaxic quality of the concoction and results are likely to be out soon. NIS director Meenakumari said the institute evaluated concoctions like Adathodai kudineer and Notchi kudineer through molecular docking study and clinical trials. The randomized controlled trials, conducted in collaboration with Government Chengalpattu Medical College Hospital and SRM Medical College Hospital, revealed that the integrated regimen with standard of care (Allopathy) and Siddha medicines has shown a sharp reduction in mortality among patients with severe infection. This regimen was found to improve oxygen saturation levels in such patients, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/kabasura-kudineer-makes-a-comeback/articleshow/81657643.cms||Ram Sundaram

Amidst the second wave of Covid infections in the country, brief lockdowns and night curfews have returned to a number of states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. The traders fear, if the cases continue to rise, lockdown may return to Bengal as well and that would hamper their business. “During the lockdown last year, we had written to the Prime Minister, home minister, finance minister and the state chief minister seeking help for the traders who were reeling under financial distress. But we got response from none. We have somehow moved past that period but we cannot afford another round of lockdown due to recklessness of the political leaders,” said Tarak Nath Trivedi, a textile businessman and general secretary of Federation of Traders Organisation of West Bengal. The organisation submitted a memorandum before the election commission requesting them to keep a vigil on the election rallies. “Be it in a road show, door-to-door visit or large meetings, most leaders are not wearing masks. Such large gatherings can spread the infection. But it seems the politicians don’t care about anything else but winning, said Kaushik Chakraborty, an executive committee member. The organisation has threatened that to would go for large scale demonstrations if the commission doesn’t step in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ask-parties-to-follow-cov-protocol-traders-urge-ec/articleshow/81657613.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The ticket refunds are being processed through Air India's own offices within pre-assigned budgeted amounts. The refunds are progressively increasing with the increase in revenue of the Company. Air India is planning to open automated refunds on more occasions as the situation improves.’’ Air India added that it has relaxed a number of ticketing rules and offered passengers the following options: 1) All domestic travel between 15/03/2020 and 24/08/2020 have one free change of date/flight/routing/booking code. The passengers have the option of changing name also in the ticket for domestic travel. 2) All international tickets with travel date between 15/03/2020 and 30/09/2020 have one free change of date/flight/routing/booking code. 3) All tickets are valid for travel till 31/12/2021 and value of the ticket is fully protected. 4) The ticket cancellation charges are also waived for all the above tickets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/deadline-for-airfare-refunds-ends-next-week/articleshow/81660567.cms||Manju V

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala assembly elections 2021: CPM’s survey predicts 85 seats for LDF, 55 for UDF||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A preliminary survey conducted by CPM predicts 85 sure seats for LDF and no seats for NDA. As per the assessment, the LDF has an edge in nine more seats while the Congress may get up to 24 seats and Muslim League may get up to 16 seats. The overall tally of UDF is projected at a maximum of 55 seats. “There is an edge for BJP in four seats such as Manjeswaram, Kazhakkoottam, Nemom and Konni, but the party has already taken special efforts to ensure that BJP doesn’t get any seats this time. The survey also predicts chances of CPM wresting Nemom, Kottayam and Aruvikkara segments. The survey team also studied the impact of corner meetings and conventions attended by Pinarayi Viajyan on pulling the crowd and increasing the vote share,” sources with CPM said. A 13-member team, which is coordinating the survey works, is compiling the reports from all the districts. “Now, all such reports will be reworked incorporating the inputs from the candidates in each segment. The state secretariat of the party, which is to be held on Friday, will review the winnability in each segment,” a CPM leader said. As per the survey report, one of the major factors which works in favour of the LDF is the welfare measures introduced by the government. This helped in attracting women, who mostly constitute the swing voters, to the LDF side. The development projects coupled with the welfare schemes has helped the LDF to increase its mass. The support of the minority communities will also be in favour of the LDF. The entry of Kerala Congress (M) is another factor which helps to garner more votes for LDF. Similarly, many of the Congress and UDF leaders have joined LDF or extended their support to the front thereby helping it to make inroads into new sections. “In Wayanad, LDF had won two of three seats in the 2016 elections. Now, we will be winning in Sultan Bathery too. Given the fact that Wayanad is the constituency represented by Rahul Gandhi, it will be a big setback for the Congress,” a CPM leader said. The CPM leadership has given instructions to the party workers to be vigilant about maintaining the pro-LDF wave in their locality till the end of the electioneering. Though the pre-poll surveys conducted by all of the media houses so far predict a handsome majority for the LDF, the party workers should continue the hard work. The party also expects that there may be surveys which are against the LDF in the coming days. Such survey results shouldn’t be taken for granted, the party has instructed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpms-survey-predicts-85-seats-for-ldf-55-for-udf/articleshow/81657629.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Shradhanand Anathalaya joint secretary Geetanjali Buty said that as regular classes were hindered by the pandemic, the orphanage was utilising the time to train girls aged between 15 and 20 in arts and crafts to foster their financial independence. Buty added that teaching these skills to the residents helps increase their knowledge about the traditions too. The gudis they are making are up for sale for corporates and individuals. The profits accrued would be deposited in the girls’ bank accounts. Sadhna Kalsarpe, a crafts teacher at the orphanage, said that for making these gudis they use wooden stands, oil painting, saffron, green and yellow-coloured sarees (customised according to the gudi size), garlands, artificial mango leaves, vessels etc. The gudi is said to represent the flag of Lord Brahma as mentioned in the Brahma Purana, an ancient Hindu text. According to Hindu mythology, Brahma created time and the Universe on this day. Gudi is commonly considered as a good omen that wards off evil and bring prosperity. Karuna, a 17-year-old resident, said she was learning the craft of making different items for the last 3 years, through which she was getting to know more about festivals like Diwali and Gudi Padwa. Around 90 members — right from infants to 20-year-olds — are residing at present in Shradhanand Anathalaya, which was established in 1927. The institution is dedicated to the care, protection and rehabilitation of orphans, destitute women and children.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vax camps in hsg socs, free trips... cities tweak norms to up turnout||MUMBAI: When the vaccination drive was opened for senior citizens and people above 45 with comorbidities on March 1, officials at the Chennai municipal corporation thought they would be swamped. Instead, they got a tepid response of barely 10,000-15,000 vaccinations in a day. An informal review showed that the lack of means to travel to a vaccination centre alone was the primary hindrance for many seniors. That’s when the corporation decided to take the vaccination booths inside housing societies that had a minimum of 100 senior citizens and people with comorbidities rather than waiting for them to reach immunisation centres.  They initially approached 2-3 societies, where the drive became a success. As the word spread, their phone lines started buzzing with housing societies from all 15 zones of the city wanting similar camps in their premises. “The results were remarkable. We are now clocking 35,000-40,000 vaccinations in a day,” Divya Darshini, joint commissioner (health) of Chennai corporation told TOI, adding that 6.5% of the city's population has now been vaccinated. Once the hurdle of transportation was taken away, many senior citizens could get vaccinated, she said. Besides taking the drive to doorsteps, the corporation also offered pick up and drop in ambulances in certain areas to encourage numbers. 63-year-old Anna Nagar resident Judy Francis told TOI over the phone that she was unsure about which vaccination centre to visit and how far the commute would be. On March 18, she learnt about a vaccination camp being set up in her building’s community hall. “I came down with my Aadhar card and got vaccinated,” she said, calling the experience a “stress-free one”. Cities like Chennai have gone ahead and tweaked norms laid down by the Centre that require drives to be carried out in medical facilities.  Darshini said they have also started mega weekend camps to cater to those who missed out on vaccination during the week. The first such camp that was at the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium last Saturday had a turnout of thousands. In north India, Rajasthan’s vaccination performance—45.41lakh doses administered till date—has been praised for coverage. The state has consistently clocked between 2.25lakh to 2.5lakh vaccinations every day with districts like Jaipur, Alwar and Nagaur topping the charts.  Rajasthan’s immunization incharge Dr Raghuraj Singh said the performance of Nagaur that lies between Jodhpur and Bikaner has been remarkable with over 3.16 vaccinations done already, nearly as much as Jaipur (3.44lakh) and Alwar (2.66lakh). “Involvement of officials like collectors, tehsildars and not just health workers worked well,” he said. Nagaur’s most successful block where over 70% have been vaccinated is Degana. Chief medical officer Dr RK Saran said the secret to good coverage was creating a buzz. “Three days before the sessions are scheduled, health workers start visiting homes. Even on the day of drive, we take hourly reviews and if the numbers are low, we send the buffer health staff to visit homes,” he said. “Roping in local celebrities, godmen and village heads has helped tremendously,” he said, adding that now they are combing voter’s list to search for those who haven’t got a shot.  In Mumbai, however, while the administration struggles to boost coverage, additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said they haven’t even got Centre’s permission to carry out drives in corporate offices. The proposal has been pending with the Centre, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-camps-in-hsg-socs-free-trips-cities-tweak-norms-to-up-turnout/articleshow/81658562.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Civic bodies turn a blind eye to illegal phone cables||JAIPUR: Illegal telephone cables are being laid in the entire city right under the nose of the administration but the officials are not taking any action. In an incident on Sunday, a tractor got stuck after the road caved in due to frequent digging. This broke the underground sewerage line of the area which continued to flood the street even after two days. Vijendra Saini, councillor of ward 62 in Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC), Greater, said that he has written to JDA and JMC, Greater multiple about the network of illegal cables in the city but no action has been taken. "The entire lane of Vidhyut Nagar where the truck got stuck is filled with sewerage water. Many holes have been dug up on the roads and there are high chances of another such incident occurring but the administration is not interested in taking any action," said Saini. Kishore Kumar, another resident of Vaishali Nagar, said that both JDA and JMC put responsibility on each other but no one is willing to take any proactive action. According to the rules, permission has to be taken by JMC or JDA to lay down wires with specific rules so that they don’t cross the road either through poles or under the ground. However, it is common to see wires hanging from electric poles and roads being dug up. Additional commissioner of JMC, Greater, Brijesh Chandolia said that whenever the corporation gets any complaint regarding the illegal cables, they immediately take action. "Any such complaint should be bought to the corporation. We are on the lookout for such violations and will take action," said Chandolia. For putting wires on electric poles, every telecom company has to get permission from JMC and pay Rs 1,500 per pole and Rs 1,000 per km. The cable cannot cross a road and has to go underground. Usually, companies take permission for 5km and cover the area of 10 km. This is huge revenue loss to JMC as well. Two weeks back, JMC, Greater, cut wires of a national telecom service provider and on March 4, 2021 published a warning to all the private telecom companies to either get the permission of all the illegal cable wires or cut the wires or else JMC, Greater, will take action against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/civic-bodies-turn-a-blind-eye-to-illegal-phone-cables/articleshow/81658566.cms||---

However, the Co-Win website says he is yet to be vaccinated or even scheduled for inoculation. Advocate Pruthu Abhyankar told TOI, “I registered for vaccination of my father Anand at AIIMS using my mobile number. I took him and also got him inoculated on March 5. I am yet to get a message about vaccination of my father done till date. Certificate is a distance dream.” Abhyankar added the status on website of Co-Win should have been ‘vaccinated’, but still it is displaying as ‘scheduled’. “I contacted AIIMS and complained about faulty status on website and also about not receiving message. I also sent two emails on March 13 and 14. Representatives at AIIMS are saying there was nothing to worry and there will be no problems in taking second dose,” he said. Abhyankar said, “I am worried about his second dose. Co-Win application at any other centre will also show that my father was not vaccinated. Also, how will we prove which vaccine he took in first dose when we have nothing in hand.” He had ensured vaccination of his mother and in-laws at centres situated in private hospitals. “I did not want to take any more risk so preferred private centres for other family members. We were given print out of certificates while in 30-minute observation at private centres,” he said. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said he will talk to officials at AIIMS and also raise the issue with the centre at Mumbai. TOI had on March 14 reported about problems of another senior citizen who took the jab at Police Hospital but received certificate showing vaccine taken at a centre in New Delhi. He had taken Covishield but certificate showed he took Covaxin. The civic body had raised the issue with the centre at Mumbai and is yet to get any reply and problem stands unsolved till date. Few senior citizens and comorbid who took the jab on first two days, March 1 and 2, also received messages but are yet to get certificates. Many of the beneficiaries received messages and also certificates from third day. NMC on Tuesday received 15,000 doses of Covishield from the office of deputy director of health services (DDHS), which received 77,000 doses from the government on Monday. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said, “Now, we have around 40,000 doses of Covishield. DDHS assured more doses soon and there would be no interruption in vaccination programme. Stock of Covaxin doses is sufficient,” he said. Vaccination in the city declined to 6,577 doses on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/co-win-status-blank-after-1st-jab-sr-citizen-clueless-on-process-for-2nd-dose/articleshow/81657639.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Plaint opposes Sriram as poll observer||Thiruvananthapuram: The management of Siraj daily has approached the Election Commission of India (ECI), chief electoral officer and the chief secretary against appointment of IAS officer Sriram Venkitaraman as election observer. Siraj Daily management representative A Saifuddin Haji has petitioned ECI secretary general Umesh Sinha, chief electoral officer Teeka Ram Meena and chief secretary V P Joy against the official, who is the main accused in the killing of journalist K M Basheer. Venkitaraman has been appointed as the observer in Tamil Nadu in the constituencies of Thiru Vi Ka Nagar and Egmore for the upcoming assembly elections in the state. The petition said that Venkitaraman has been appointed as the observer when ECI rules stipulate that officials who are accused in criminal cases should not be appointed as election observers. In the guidelines for officials issued on January 16, 2019, it has been said that an officer appointed on election duty should not be an accused in any criminal case in any court. Also, the official should give an affidavit before ECI that none of his close relatives are contesting in the elections, and the officer is not an accused in any criminal case. The petitioner said that every state sends only untainted officers for election duty. Meanwhile, government sources said that the officer has been sent on election duty because there is an immense shortage of officers in the state. Also, the officer was sent on election duty in November last year when there was no such complaint, a top government official said. Judicial magistrate A Aneesa had earlier this month directed the first accused Venkitaraman and second accused Wafa Feroz to appear in the sessions court. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/plaint-opposes-sriram-as-poll-observer/articleshow/81657644.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Vadodara||Gobar sticks’ eco-friendly Holika Dahan||Vadodara: Bars made of cow dung, known as ‘gobar sticks’, a perfect environment friendly replacement for the large quantities of firewood that is burnt every year on ‘Holika Dahan’ is being manufactured by a Panchmahal shelter for rescued cows.The process of making the sticks has been around for several years, but eco-friendly product wasn’t much popular earlier. But now the demand for the ‘gobar sticks’ is gathering pace. Organisation like Gayatri Parivar advocating ‘Vedic Holi’ has also helped in rise in demand of ‘gobar sticks’. Somia Baria started the shelter to ensure that cows did not end up in slaughter houses. The shelter has both rescued cows and those that are a liability for their owners. “They do not yield any milk and need care till they are alive,” said Baria.Baria says he got the machine that is used in production of the sticks last year. It was around the time when shelter’s expenses were mounting and Baria was not able to pay the fodder supplier on time. “The supplier was angry with me, but when he saw the situation of the shelter he decided to provide me with a machine from Punjab to make cow dung sticks,” he said. He tweaked the machine so that it ran on a diesel engine and not electricity and started producing the sticks. The sticks are cheap and quick to produce, informed Baria. “They cost Rs 10 per kilogram. The only time-consuming process is drying them. They generate good heat and can be used for various purposes. Some people use them in funeral pyres too,” he said.These days the demand for the sticks has picked up as many have started preferring it over wood. “The orders are trickling in from Vadodara, Bharuch and Panchmahal districts,” said Baria.Amongst others, the Gayatri Parivar has also started encouraging Vedic Holis that use these sticks. Sevandar Kalwani said that the organization was guiding people to the shelter for the sticks. He added that so far four locations in Godhra have ordered the sticks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/gobar-sticks-eco-friendly-holika-dahan/articleshow/81656588.cms||Sachin Sharma

There are many hostels in the university where list has been uploaded for the new admissions as they have to maintain social distancing in the rooms. Many students who have taken admission this year are now finding it difficult to arrange an accommodation. Riya, a student of MA first year, said that she was told that the list of Malviya hostel will soon be released but later on they were told that due to Covid guidelines university is finding it difficult to release the list. “I had to stay in hotels for a while, but when it is clear that list will not be released, I have booked a room in a PG. This is unfair as we have opted for a government university so that we can stay in campus in cheap accommodation,” said Riya. Another student Siyali said that almost all the hostels have taken out their list except Malviya as already 90 girls are staying in there. There are more seats in the hostels but due to pandemic administration is not able to allot it to the students. A faculty member of the administration said that they have to follow rules laid down by the state government. “In Malviya hostels, rooms are small in size although they are two seaters. When the number of Covid cases are rising, it will be difficult to manage its spreads in the hostels. Once the situation becomes normal, we will take out the list,” said a faculty member. NSUI spokesperson Ramesh Bhati said that there is need to get some alternate arrangement for these students or else they have to pay hefty amount in hotels or travel from nearby villages every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ru-students-jostling-for-hostel-seat-due-to-tough-covid-rules/articleshow/81658572.cms||---

The next hearing of the case is March 31. The single bench of Justice S P Sharma issued the order on a petition by Dinesh Jhakar and others.The court said the result written exam of Constable was declared for six districts and at GRP Ajmer while the result of other categories has been declared five times, the result of OBC has been declared of 97 candidates only for the total number of 57 posts. Similarly in Bundi, the result of ST Category is declared for only two persons, whereas there was one post and five cnaddiates result should have been declared. In Rajsmand for OBC, there were 34 posts, only 139 candidates have been declared passed instead of five times. In Ajmer in ex-serviceman category, 43 posts are earmarked for ex-serviceman and 215 candidates were declared passed.

The department has compiled details of all allotments to ensure that those given at concessional rates were not being misused for other purposes.An official said, “We have conducted the survey and there are 42 defaulters including hospitals, education, religious and social institutes who are not adhering to the norms. Cases have been forwarded to the state government.”Officials claimed that many private hospitals, which are beneficiaries of concessional land, have failed to abide by the terms and conditions of providing free medication to 25% patients from Below Poverty Line (BPL) category.“As per a mandatory provision, private hospitals, which have been allotted land at concessional rates, have to provide free medication to 25% BPL patients. Moreover, it is compulsory to fix an hour and provide free medical check-ups to poor patients at the outpatient department (OPD). Similarly, 10% beds should be reserved for the poor. However, majority of the hospitals have failed to fulfil the terms and conditions. The issue was also raised in the state assembly when the Congress was in opposition,” an official said.Similarly, some educational institutes are not adhering to the norms. A source said, “The department will forward the land details to the departments concerned to crack a whip as allottees are misusing the land. A joint operation will be carried out soon after a state’s direction.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/42-land-allottees-flout-guidelines/articleshow/81658626.cms||---

According to the latest report of the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), Gujarat, the number of nationalized bank branches declined from 3,992 on March 31, 2020, to 3,718 on December 31, 2020. “After the merger of the banks, a number of bank branches have been co-located for convenience of operations. As a consequence, several bank branches have been shut,” said M M Bansal, convener, SLBC-Gujarat. On April 1, 2020, Allahabad Bank and Indian Bank merged. Corporation Bank and Andhra Bank merged into Union Bank. Merger was effected between Syndicate Bank and Canara Bank. And United Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce merged into Punjab National Bank (PNB). On April 1, 2019, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank had merged into Bank of Baroda. Of the 274 bank branches shut, maximum of 266 were closed by Bank of Baroda whereas PNB shut down nine branches and Union Bank shuttered 17 branches. Representatives of the Bank Employees’ Association indicated that the closure of bank branches will impact employment in the banking sector. Janak Rawal, general secretary, Maha Gujarat Bank Employees’ Association (MGBEA), said: “With the rationalization of bank branches, fresh job creation has already come to a standstill across nationalized banks.” Rawal added: “This is because each branch will have surplus staffers. In fact, several banks have not yet shown any intent for fresh recruitments for the current as well as the upcoming financial year.” Interestingly, most branches that were shut are in rural and semi-urban areas. “If banks are located in close vicinity, they have been shut,” said a source in the banking sector. “However, banks have ensured that not a single geographical location is left without a branch while rationalizing.”s||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/274-branches-of-nationalized-banks-shut/articleshow/81657663.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Kochi||A candidate for the green cause||Kochi: The state had faced a devastating flood in 2018 and back-to-back landslides and extremely heavy rain in the last three years. There was a complete dry-up of rivers and wells after the extreme rainfall events of 2018. Though sand mining, quarrying, land use and misuse have been the main concerns of the people of Kerala for the past few years, environmental issues don’t seem to be a major concern of the political parties. Strangely, even the environment groups are silent. However, one man has decided to contest the assembly election to raise the issue of the sand mafia in Bharathapuzha. Hussain Thattathazhath of Kerala Nadi Samrakshana Samithi is contesting as an independent candidate in Thrithala. “It has become so worse. These people are razing our mountains to the ground and mining the sand from our rivers. Finally, the coming generations will neither have water to drink or rains to fill the wells. Lots of activities are being done in the name of disaster management. The cost of one unit of river sand is around Rs 8,000 now. To fill one Torus truck, it could be about three units. But they overload it with four-five units illegally. This is done in connivance with officials and politicians,” said Hussain, who campaigns with a risk to his life. “I almost got attacked today when we were capturing the visuals of the mining using a drone camera. My child was also along with me. I told them that if they hurt my child, I will air the whole thing live,” Hussain said. Hussain said that despite many of the rivers drying-up, there was no let-up in governments giving permission to exploit the environment. “They came to my house and offered me Rs 50 lakh to withdraw my candidature as I was raising this issue in my campaign,” he added. Kerala Nature Protection Council president C M Joy said that when the Left government came to power, there was lot of excitement that they would support green issues. “But the CM openly declared that nobody needed to come to him talking about the environment. Most environmentalists have Left leanings and hence are quiet,” said Joy. S P Ravi, secretary, Chalakkudy River Protection Samithi, said that be it Centre or the state, environment is just brushed aside irrespective of political lines. “One can say the same about the UDF also. There is a general sense of helplessness among green activists. The state is indeed missing writer-activists like Sukumar Azhikode and Sugathakumari. However, the more we protest, the more the governments continue to push for anti-environment policies in the name of infrastructure development,” Ravi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-candidate-for-the-green-cause/articleshow/81657657.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Hyderabad||Rogue loan apps have roots in Bengaluru, Mumbai: Telangana to HC||HYDERABAD: A majority of money lending apps and firms have their roots in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Mumbai and Pune and efforts are on to nab the culprits, said the Telangana government. State’s special government pleader A Sanjeev Kumar said this to a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy which was hearing a public interest petition of advocate Kalyan Dilip Sunkara. The bench sought a fresh status report from the government on the investigation into the loan apps case and posted the matter to April 15. Sanjeev informed the judges that probe teams had gone to Mysuru, Bengaluru and Mumbai to arrest the culprits. In a report filed to the court, Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Muralidhar Bhagwat said: “When our investigation teams have gone there, they are finding no one. However, we shut down 48 such illegal instant loan apps and arrested four persons.” Sanjeev Kumar, who filed the report, said there was a Chinese national among the arrested persons. Six persons had died by suicide tormented by representatives of these rogue instant loan apps in the state in the last few months. Kalyan said: “These loan sharks lure the innocents into a trap with promises of quick loans and then create a vicious circle for borrowers. They will never be able to get out of this trap unless the state government intervenes and shuts all these illegal loan apps.” He also told the court that they charge exorbitant interest rates of 150-450 per cent per week and per fortnight for the instant loans they provide to gullible people. Since downloading such apps would provide an easy access to the contacts list of the borrowers, the recovery agents call the friends and relatives of the borrowers and defame them, the petitioner said. “Several borrowers have found it difficult to cope up with this unfair pressure and ended their lives,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rogue-loan-apps-have-roots-in-bluru-mumbai-t-to-hc/articleshow/81658627.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Jaipur||Now, local bodies can cancel lease deeds in urban areas||Jaipur: The state government has given rights to urban local bodies and development authorities to cancel registered lease deeds and revoke allotment of plots in urban areas made on concessional rates, which are obtained after false documents. The Rajasthan Laws (amendment) bill, 2021, passed by the assembly last week grants this right to local bodies. For the same, amendments have been made in the Rajasthan Urban Improvement Act, 1959 and Rajasthan Municipalities Act, 2009.Explaining the amendment, an official said, "Any allotment of land obtained or lease deed procured by presenting representational facts or on the basis of false documents can be revoked after issuing a show-cause notice."In present time, several instances are seen where many an allottee changes the purposes of land, violating the terms and conditions on which the allotment was made or lease was executed. Such violations trigger conflicts between the interests of individuals and the common good. It is also found that sometimes lease is obtained by misrepresentation of facts or on the basis of false documents, this tendency frustrates the very purpose for whichthe allotment of land was made. "A provision regarding revocation of allotment and cancellation of lease deed is the need of time so that the land allotted on concessional rates is not being misused for other purposes and beneficiaries of the land learn to abide by terms and conditions on which the land is allotted to them," reads the bill.Apart from this, the state government has stripped the powers of development authorities to open seals of unauthorized buildings. The seal will not be removed without the prior permission of the government or official authorized by the government. While the ULBs will be allowed only to seal the buildings, a third party will be appointed to open them. The amendment was done after urban development and housing minister (UDH) Shanti Dhariwal received the complaints of officials regarding alleged corruption in opening the seal of the buildings.The bill reads, there are provisions for seizure of unauthorized constructions or improvement of building against the permission issued according to the by-laws but the existing provisions of revocation of seizure are not as effective as were envisaged. "Resultantly, problems such as traffic, fire safety, parking, etc., are aggravated. Hence, the necessity is felt to provide for a rider that seal will not be removed without prior permission of the State Government or the officer authorized by the Government," further reads the bill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/now-local-bodies-can-cancel-lease-deeds-in-urban-areas/articleshow/81658628.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Holi celebrations in city will invite action: BMC||MUMBAI: Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal in an order issued on Tuesday prohibited public and private celebrations of the upcoming festival of Holi in view of the rising Covid-19 cases in the city. The circular said that to avoid crowding, Holi Dahan on March 28 and Rangpanchmi celebrations on March 29 would not be allowed. The order said that in view of the ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ campaign, people should avoid having any celebrations on their own. Many housing societies come together for Holi Dahan each year. The new surge has shown that most of the cases are from housing societies. The order states that people had been requested to cooperate with the authorities, failing which action can be initiated against them under the Epidemic Act, 1897, Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the IPC of 1860. Corporator Swapna Mhatre, while welcoming the move, said that restrictions were good but people should be allowed to ensure that tradition is followed. “The entire past year has gone with citizens observing no festival. Now they should be allowed to observe the day, but in case anyone flouts the rule strict action must be initiated against them,” said Mhatre. Activist Anil Galgali said the order was good as everything had opened up and people are not taking the surge seriously. “If there is a probationary order, people will at least follow it. Action can also be taken if required,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-holi-celebrations-in-city-will-invite-action-bmc/articleshow/81658638.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Kochi||Candidates in Palakkad must have ‘water agenda’: Green activists||Palakkad: The people in the water-starved areas of the eastern parts of the district and the Attapadi tribal areas and the environment organizations like Bharathapuzha Samrakshana Samithi have demanded that a ‘water agenda’ be declared by candidates of all 12 assembly constituencies of the district. Samithi activists said that they have been agitating for the protection of Bharathapuzha (Nila), the lifeline of the people of Palakkad, Malappuram and Thrissur districts where lakhs of people depend on the river for drinking and other purposes. But the river is almost dead due to its wanton destruction like indiscriminate sand mining, encroachment of the river banks and river beds, etc. They said that during monsoon season the river used to overflow and create destruction but during summer it dries up, resulting in the dearth of drinking-water sources. Though various governments have announced measures to protect Nila, most of them remain only on paper and the river disappears for almost six months, causing environmental disaster. Samithi activists said that candidates contesting from the 12 constituencies of the district should declare a ‘water agenda’ to take the problem of destruction of Bharathapuzha and other rivers to the people. Palakkad is an agriculture-dominated district, and paddy and other cultivation depend on irrigation water from reservoirs like Malampuzha, Pothundy, Walayar, Chulliyar, Kanjirapuzha, Mangalam, Parambikulam, Mankara, etc. Samithi activists said that Kerala is not getting its due share of water from the inter-state Parambikulam Aliyar Project (PAP) agreement with Tamil Nadu to share the waters for Bharathapuzha, Periyar and Chalakudypuzha. The agreement should have been renewed after 30 years. But the agreement signed in 1957 was never renewed. Because of this, there is a shortage for drinking and irrigation water in Chittur and other parts of the district, and the new MLAs should seek to address it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/candidates-in-palakkad-must-have-water-agenda-green-activists/articleshow/81657672.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Professor Abdul Majeed Nizami, former head of the Department of Arabic, Ottoman University said that dowry and suicide had become a curse in the society and some people rush to take extreme step over certain issues. “The objective of this is to create awareness among the people and parents about the curse of dowry and suicide. The people should deal the challenges peacefully rather taking any extreme step. Simultaneously, the demand of dowry made many girls sit home which has been a challenge for the parents, which is necessary to eradicate this social evil from the society,” said Nizami. The organisation said more than 200 imams & khateebs would deliver sermon on Friday against the social evils prevailing in the society. “The imams and khateebs will deliver sermons against the social evils at different mosques across the country,” added professor Nizami.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/muslim-scholars-on-anti-dowry-campaign/articleshow/81658650.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: ‘Covid bus’ on tour of temple towns||DEHRADUN: Twenty-two passengers of a bus, travelling from Gujarat, tested positive for Covid-19 in Rishikesh on Monday night. The bus on a 15-day North India trip, boarded mostly by elderly women, travelled to Jaipur, Pushkar, Mathura and Haridwar before reaching Rishikesh where the health department conducted their tests after a few showed symptoms of the virus. Not only that, the health department officials said that they were finding it difficult to trace the tourists in question as a few of them had provided wrong phone numbers. As a result, there is no information on whether they have been hospitalised or isolated. Talking to TOI, additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Tehri, Jagdish Joshi said that the bus was stopped near Muni Ki Reti on March 18 where a health team screened the passengers. “We conducted rapid antigen tests on a few passengers, but they tested negative. As a few of them had fever and cold, we decided to take their RT-PCR samples that turned out positive on Monday night. Of the 50 travellers, 22 tested positive for Covid-19,” Joshi added. “We have communicated about their Covid reports to the local administration and health department of the districts concerned. Now, they will ensure they are treated for the virus,” said Joshi. When TOI contacted Mahesh Bhai, owner of the travel agency that booked 50 passengers from various villages of Gujarat for the trip, he said, “We started on March 7, covered Ambaji temple in Banaskantha district of Gujarat, Jaipur, Pushkar and Mathura. We reached Haridwar on March 18, where the tourists wanted to take a holy dip in Ganga. We were scheduled to return on March 20, but with two days still in our hands we visited Neelkanth Mahadev temple in Rishikesh,” said Mahesh, and added that he had personally called all the 22 people and asked them to either go to the hospital or get themselves isolated at homes. He also said that while 45 passengers boarded the bus from Gujarat (of the 50 who booked), another 10 people had joined the group in Rajasthan. When questioned if he was not aware that RT-PCR negative certificate is required for tourists in various states, including Uttarakhand (Dehradun), the travel agency owner claimed that every passenger had a Covid-negative certificate with them when they began the journey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/22-on-bus-from-gujarat-test-covid-in-rishikesh-after-covering-jaipur-pushkar-mathura-and-haridwar/articleshow/81656774.cms||Ishita Mishra

In a matter of concern, the positivity rate has jumped from 0.4% as recently as March 17 to nearly 1% in last 24 hours. The increase in positivity rate in the state comes in the backdrop of a similar increase for the country, where the rate stands at 3.7%, a sharp increase from 1.7% in the beginning of the month. According to World Health Organization (WHO) if the positivity rate stands below 1%, the rate of infection is stable and virus spread is not rapid. The state had recorded 478 cases on December 26 last year when cumulative cases were 2.84lakh. The increase in the number of cases in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) is another cause of worry. Cases touched the 100 mark after three months. On Tuesday, 103 cases were recorded as per health department data. It last reported 127 cases on December 13 last year. “If the positivity rate goes beyond 1%, then there is serious worry where serous social distance protocols have to be followed,” Dr Kiran Madala , ICMR-certified researcher said.  There is a need to main individual hygiene and to wear masks as most cases are asymptomatic, he added. Experts said there is a need to keep track of the ‘R factor’ as well which shows the the number of people who are likely to get the infection from one person. With increasing number of cases, health department is taking measures like testing persons only after the ‘One Time Password’ is sent to their mobile phones and it is shown to officials. Currently changes are being made in the software. State has a capacity to do more than one lakh tests daily. In the districts, officials have been on the alert keeping track of cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-cases-spike-in-city-crosses-100-mark-again/articleshow/81657685.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Krishnanagar police registered an offence and are investigating further. The complainant, Sanjay Patel, stated that he was at his grocery shop on Saturday when Rajendra alias Radhe Patel, a resident of Chiloda, came to his shop. The accused is known to the complainant and asked Sanjay for the order he had placed earlier. According to police, Sanjay told him that his tempo was out for deliveries and when it returned he would get the groceries delivered. This angered Rajendra who started abusing him and attacked him. Rajendra also bit Sanjay’s hand. As people gathered, Rajendra left the shop. Sanjay said he was asked by community members not to lodge a complaint, and thus did not. On Sunday, Rajendra came with his son Maulik to the shop and threatened him against lodging a FIR. Sanjay then decided to file a complaint against the father and son.

---||Kozhikode||Vallikkunnu INL candidate takes the ‘smart’ route||Kozhikode: Going one step further from the ‘clichéd’ WhatsApp groups and Instagram live to seek votes, the campaign team of Indian National League candidate in Vallikkunnu has come up with a mobile application, Smart Vallikkunnu, to connect with voters. It was Left front candidate A P Abdul Vahab who collaborated with QKopy, the startup behind GOK-direct, the application used by the state government for information dissemination during the pandemic, to try a new way to connect with voters. “The app conveys the development plans of candidates, updates on campaign trail, content from the Urappaan LDF campaign and general updates about Vallikkunnu. At a time when talking for long with everyone is difficult due to the pandemic, we thought that a dedicated app for this would be ideal during the campaign,” said an official with the campaign. He added that through the app voters can also connect with the candidate. Unlike social media where the reaction to updates from the candidate is public, through the app, the voters can personally contact the candidate. “There is a suggestion button in the app with the icon of WhatsApp. Upon clicking the button, the voter is taken to a WhatsApp chat window in which the voter can personally convey his comments and requirements to the candidate. Even those who don't wish to publically make contact with the candidate due to political reasons would be able to express their suggestion through this option,” said an official with the campaign adding that the candidate can even plan his development programmes based on the response from voters. The campaign has launched QR code stamps as well with which supporters can download the app and learn about the plans and strategies of the candidate. A link for downloading the app is also being widely circulated by the campaigners online. Posters and hoardings of the candidate would also have the QR code. Arun Perooli, founder and CEO of Qkopy said more campaigners have started showing interest in the concept. “It is a very efficient method for candidates to directly broadcast their ideas to a voter base. Also, they would be able to know what their voters are thinking through the responses,” said Perooli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/vallikkunnu-inl-candidate-takes-the-smart-route/articleshow/81657713.cms||---

They said that the management is putting everyone at risk by keeping the school open and asking students to collect books from school. “I went to school to collect books along with my children on Monday. At campus, I was told some teachers tested positive. It’s not right on management’s part to put everyone at risk by hiding positive cases,” said a parent, whose children are in class 3 and class 6. The parent said the school is holding physical classes for upper primary and high school. The principal refused to confirm any positive cases. “I have not received any application for Covid-19 leave.

---||Kochi||57% c-section deliveries in Ernakulam take place in govt hospitals||KOCHI: Ernakulam district sees almost 51% deliveries through caesarean, with c-section being done more in government hospitals (57% of the total deliveries) than in private (50%), the ministry of health and family welfare’s district health factsheet for 2019-20 has revealed. In contrast, in Thiruvananthapuram, only 33% deliveries are done through caesarean with 36% in private and 27% in government hospitals. However, the highest number of c-section deliveries are in Pathanamthitta - 58%. The districts that have the lowest caesarean deliveries are in Wayanad and Malappuram (26% each). In Malappuram, 27% of the total deliveries in private and 22% of the total deliveries in public hospitals are through caesarean and in Wayanad, it is 30% in private and 18% in government hospitals. While medically justified c-section births help prevent maternal mortality, the World Health Organization (WHO) insists that the rate of c-sections in a region should not exceed 15%. However, in all districts in the state, the percentage share of c-section births in private and public health facilities remains above the WHO recommended marker. “Actually, I am not surprised with such high percentage here. Women are not willing to exercise and find excuses for not exercising during pregnancy. Added with this is our unhealthy food habits. All this makes delivery difficult,” said Dr Smithy George, senior consultant, gynecologist, Cooperative Hospital at Kakkanad. Increasing nuclear families and resultant less support system post-delivery and changing life habits are other key contributors. “Now, we see an increase in the number of patients who in advance demand that they would like to deliver through caesarean. When we try to explain to them the importance of normal delivery, they argue that they are scared of the pain involved in normal delivery. When patients turn demanding, even the gynecologist are not willing to take risk,” said federation of obstetric and gynaecological societies of India vice-president elect Dr Fessy Louis. Doctors said that a woman could request for a c-section even without any medical indication. But in such a case, her request cannot be denied and she and her relatives need to be explained and counselled about the risks and complications of unnecessary caesarean. Many of the times, it is the fear and ignorance which is behind most such requests. Also due to hectic schedules, many mothers-to-be especially working mothers are reluctant to attend pregnancy-related classes and exercise programmes. “Whether done as an elective or emergency, there are specific indications for a caesarean section and all obstetricians follow the protocol. No doctor agrees to a caesarean just because a patient demands it,” said Dr Shobha Pillai, associate professor, department of obstetrics and gynaecology, Government Medical College, Ernakulam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/57-c-sec-deliveries-in-ekm-take-place-in-govt-hospitals/articleshow/81656782.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Mumbai||‘Will even go to court to find out whom MVA wanted to protect’||MUMBAI: Devendra Fadnavis alleged that CM Uddhav Thackeray had not acted on a report on a police transfers racket. “The CM did not take any action though the GAD (general administration department) comes under him. The report has been with the government since August 2020, but till date no action has been taken on it. Seems like he shielded and protected this entire racket to save his government,” Fadnavis alleged at a press meet. Fadnavis said the report with intercepted call data was submitted by Rashmi Shukla to the then director general of police Subodh Jaiswal on August 25 last year, who in turn submitted it to the ACS (home) on August 26. The phone tapping was done after permission from then additional chief secretary (home) Sitaram Kunte, he said. The call data intercepts include names of senior IPS and non-IPS officers, junior officers and politicians, Fadnavis said. The report had subsequently reached the CM, he said, but no action was taken. “In his letter, the DG has recommended it be brought to the notice of the CM and identify those named. He had also asked that the secrecy of the report be ensured to avoid bringing disrepute to the government,” said Fadnavis. Fadnavis accused the MVA of “punishing” Shukla, “who has worked on the post under 3 governments and has an impeccable record for exposing the transfer racket”. “Rashmi Shukla, despite being the seniormost police officer, was overlooked for a promotion. She was promoted as DG of civil defence—a non-existent post not even sanctioned by the cabinet. B ut those whose names surface in call intercepts have got the posts they wanted,” he alleged.  Speaking to the media later after meeting the Union home secretary, Fadnavis said, “Whom was the government (MVA) trying to protect? ... If required we shall even approach the courts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-will-even-go-to-court-to-find-out-whom-mva-wanted-to-protect/articleshow/81658736.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Kerala assembly polls: Elect LDF, create history, says Sitaram Yechury||KOZHIKODE: CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury, who began campaigning for the LDF at Manjeswaram on Tuesday, said that there was no issue in connection with Sabarimala in Kerala. “The case is before a larger bench of the Supreme Court. Till that verdict comes, there is no issue. Once that verdict comes, CM has assured that implementation of the same will be discussed with everybody and then implemented,” he said. Speaking at Trikaripur candidate M Rajagopalan’s campaign rally, Yechury said it was an honour to seek votes for LDF from the area that elected a communist chief minister for the first time and from people who was represented by the first opposition leader in parliament, AK Gopalan. “Like you created history in 1967, you are going to change history in 2021 by having the same government return to office. That history-changing responsibility is with all of you today,” Yechury said. He said the anti-Constitutional and anti-democratic methods that BJP and Congress are applying here together must be rejected by the masses in elections. “Today, we know Left is the actual alternative. But they are trying their level best to misuse agencies of central government to destabilize LDF government. They tried and failed during the last five years. Now they will try again and you have to ensure that they don’t succeed. In this effort started by Centre, Congress and UDF are playing in tandem instead of attacking policies they don’t agree to,” Yechury said. He said he was seeking a second term for LDF government as it was important for the future of Kerala and India. “India’s Constitution and its democratic foundation are under severe threat today. It is being dismantled by the very forces that control the government in Delhi. So, defeating them with alternative policies that will strengthen India and people’s future is an absolute necessity. That is why a victory of LDF is important not only for Kerala but for India; this is a historic responsibility all of you have today,” said Yechury. Of the 600-odd promises LDF made five years ago, over 580 were fulfilled and no other party has such a record, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/elect-ldf-create-history-says-yechury/articleshow/81657726.cms||---

Rain and hailstorm continued for a long time along the Pakistan border at Tanot, Sadhewali, Ghantiyali and other areas. Sources said many birds and cattle died in the dust storm. In Barmer, crop losses were reported on a massive scale. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot in a tweet said it was very sad to know about damage caused in many areas of Jaisalmer and Barmer. He directed officers to get the survey of these areas done at the earliest to provide relief to affected farmers. The storm entered India from Pakistan at a speed of 40-50kmph and reached many areas at Tanot and Ramgarh.At Sadewala, 25-30 goats died because of the hailstorm, while at Degrai pastures, a flock of Demoiselle cranes was killed after they fell on live power lines during the storm. The storm later spread to many canal areas including Ramgarh, Mohangarh and Sultana.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad scientists develop kit to diagnose hepatitis C, Covid||HYDERABAD: City researchers have developed a diagnostic kit that uses gold nanoparticles to diagnose hepatitis C infection in 30 minutes. The novel method can also be extended to diagnose several killer viral ailments like Covid-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), HIV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The method helps in early stage detection, thus preventing pathogen from causing extensive damage to the body. The research team is from Bioviz Technologies, Hyderabad and BITS Pilani, Hyderabad campus and comprised Dr Mahammad Nanne Khaja, Almas Shamaila Mohammed, Aniket Balapure, Ramakrishnan Ganesan and Jayati Ray Dutta. Study result was published in scientific journal, Analyst, by The Royal Society of Chemistry, UK. One can detect viral load as small as 100 IU mL (international units per millilitre). This method is better than gold standard RT-qPCR tests as that takes minimum of four hours. Dr Khaja said there are two methods to detect viral load of hepatitis C – serological tests to find viral antigens using assay methods like ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and molecular methods through RT-qPCR (reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction). “Our method based on gold nanoparticles is inexpensive,” he said. Dr Khaja, who heads Bioviz Technologies that funded project, said antiviral drugs can cure over 95% of hepatitis C virus cases, with timely treatment. “The method is rapid and cost-effective detection assay that can be used in resource limited settings for mass level screening," he said. Assay exhibited 100% sensitivity and specificity with 88 samples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-scientists-develop-kit-to-diagnose-hep-c-covid/articleshow/81657724.cms||Syed Akbar

In this extended window, an equal number of first-time beneficiaries can be accommodated, officials said. The directive will also change certain protocols. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “Under the six-to-eight week protocol, beneficiaries will no longer get an SMS indicating time for the next dose. They will be given second dates at the time of the first shot itself. Those who’ve already received their first Covishield shot may have to reschedule their second-dose appointment or walk into a centre on a due date convenient to them as long as it’s within protocols.”State immunization officer, DN Patil said, “Those who come for their second dose 28 days after the first will now be asked to come after six weeks. But if they insist on the second dose sooner than six weeks, we will comply as the interval is four to eight weeks.”Dr Patil said the additional 15-day window will allow the state to inoculate more beneficiaries with first doses. “For instance, if a beneficiary is inoculated with the first dose on March 24, he/she would be due for the second dose after 45 days, instead of the earlier 28-day gap between two doses,” he said.Dr Deshmukh added, “Nearly 10,000-15,000 people in Pune circle (Pune, Satara and Solapur districts) would have been due for their second Covishield dose during the first week of April. That load has now been delayed by two more weeks. And during this time, we can give more people their first doses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wider-covishield-interval-means-11k-more-recipients/articleshow/81657721.cms||Neha Madaan

Tikait said he would have to travel to Delhi again with a tractor while appealing to the farmers to make the March 26 bandh a success. Thunderstorm followed by rain played spoilsport at the Kisan Mahapanchyat organised at Vidyadhar Nagar stadium on Tuesday. Though the organisers planned a mega gathering of about a lakh farmers, the attendance was thin. Tikait could not complete his speech due to the rain and storm. Even a portion of the pandal collapsed because of the sudden showers. However, no one injured in the incident. More than a dozen farmer leaders addressed the Mahapanchayat. The Modi government was on the target of almost all farmers ire. The leaders accused the central government of cheating them in the name of MSP. Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesman Tikait while addressing the gathering alleged that the leaders of the BJP government at the Centre were dividing people on the basis of caste and religion.  “Now the time has come to raise slogans of Jai Ram and Jai Bhim along with Allah hu Akbar for the progress of the country,” he said. Chandrasekhar, head of Bhim Army, said the farmers are not free today. All people of the country will have to be united in the agitation, including banks and insurance employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kisan-mahapanchayat-calls-bharat-bandh-on-march-26/articleshow/81658731.cms||---

But there is no harm for people who have already taken the second dose between four to six weeks. It will still be effective,” said Nikhil Mathur, Group Chief of Medical Services, Care Hospitals. “The first dose gives you priming and helps in aligning of cells involved in the immune system. This process takes around four weeks before real activity starts after second dose. Taking the second dose after 6-8 weeks is fine but you can’t keep delaying it,” said Dr Vyakarnam Nageshwar, allergist and immunologist at Aswini Allergy Centre, Chikkadpally. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dont-delay-jab-more-than-advised-docs/articleshow/81657763.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The first phase will involve fill-and-finish operations which can commence by taking the vaccine in bulk from Bharat Biotech. In the second phase, Haffkine will start manufacturing the doses by taking the technology from the pharma company which will take one and a half years. Sanjay Rathod, managing director of Haffkine Bio Pharmaceuticals, said preliminary talks with Bharat Biotech took place late last week. “If the company supplies raw material, we have committed to produce 12.6 crore doses of the vaccine annually and scale it up to 22.8 crore doses once the BSL laboratory is in place,” he told TOI on Tuesday. State health minister Rajesh Tope said, “The PM was positive about the request made by the chief minister for permitting technology transfer for manufacturing Covid vaccine.

The slump was caused by a vaccine shortage at nearly 90 sites in Pune rural (out of 157). The centres were left unable to start their daily sessions. Officials in the region said they received 50,000 Covishield shots by 4pm. “The vaccine coverage on Wednesday will be better,” said Ayush Prasad, the chief executive officer of the Pune Zilla Parishad. District officials said Tuesday’s single-day slump will not affect overall efforts to take daily vaccinations in the region to 40,000 recipients. Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic bodies operated 96 and 50 vaccination sites respectively on Tuesday — their highest number of centres till date. In Pune city, 13,722 beneficiaries were given the shot. In Pimpri Chinchwad, the number was at 4,419 beneficiaries. And in Pune rural, nearly 5,000 people received their jabs.

However, this has now led to confusion among vaccine beneficiaries in the state. Speaking to TOI, M Raghuram, a 62-year-old resident of Kukatpally, said, “I took the first dose of my vaccine last week. A few people are saying that the second dose will not be effective if I wait for more than a month before my second dose. The government on the other hand has revised the time window within which the second dose of the Covishield vaccine can be taken. I’m confused about when I should get my second dose.” The Centre on Monday asked all states and union territories to administer the second dose between six to eight weeks — but not later than eight weeks — instead of the present four to six weeks window. “I took the second dose of the vaccine after waiting for 28-days as advised by the government earlier. Does that mean the vaccine I took will not be effective?” asked G Gopal, a frontline worker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revised-vaccine-jab-interval-leaves-beneficiaries-confused/articleshow/81657775.cms||Moulika.KV

Luckily, there are no casualties and about 25 people who suffered severe injuries, including fractures, were undergoing treatment at various hospitals in Suryapet and Hyderabad. Talking to media personnel, Suryapet superintendent of police (SP) R Bhaskar said a case was booked under Sections 336, 337 and 338 of the IPC against the contractor, Shiva Sai Decorators, and the organiser of the event. “We are in the process of gathering all documents related to the event, including contract agreements and fitness certificate issued by government agencies to the contractor,” the SP said. Suryapet Town police, who are investigating the case, said that during the preliminary investigation, it was noticed that the contractor had not built the gallery properly. “The east gallery, which collapsed, should have strength to accommodate 2,500 spectators. But it collapsed when 1,500 people were there. The side support to the gallery was not provided with iron rods. At some places, logs were used for support instead of iron rods. Even the welding was not done properly,” Suryapet I Town police said. Despite the mishap, the event continued on Monday night and Tuesday. Telangana minister G Jagadish Reddy said that immediately after the incident, about 100 persons were rushed to hospitals and, after the initial treatment, 80 persons were sent home after first-aid. “Now, about 20-25 persons, who suffered slightly severe injuries, are undergoing treatment in Suryapet and Hyderabad.

In the first phase, three more floating jetties — aside from the one commissioned at the CoP jetty — were to come up at Campal, Old Goa and Chapora by June, but will now be commissioned only later this year. The target, which is part of CoP’s plan, also includes demolishing the existing lighthouse behind Kala Academy. “The department also proposes to take up the demolition of the existing lighthouse structure and reconstruct the same for navigation at Campal,” said a senior CoP official. “PWD has been asked to prepare the feasibility report and once that is received, we will start the process for seeking financial sanction.” While the floating jetties are being built at a cost of Rs 9.6 crore, which the inland waterways authority of India (IWAI) will fund, the reconstruction of the lighthouse is being funded by the state. Government officials said that the pandemic and the subsequent austerity measures imposed by the state government had also brought construction of the CoP terminal to a halt. “In the first phase, four jetties were planned, but because of the pandemic, things got delayed. We are trying to get the jetties commissioned in another four to five months,” said a government official. All four jetties, funded by the IWAI, were to be installed at Rs 10 crore by the contractor, REL Marintek Infra Pvt Ltd. The first concrete floating jetty, the first in the country, was inaugurated by Union minister of state for shipping, Mansukh Mandaviya, in February. At that time, Mandaviya and state authorities said that the remaining floating jetties would be installed in four months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-sets-december-target-to-complete-floating-jetties/articleshow/81657779.cms||Newton Sequeira

It should be probed, on whose behest that person is cooking up new stories. (I am) Ready for any sort of investigation. Only thing is that they should be truthful and legal. But, the illegal attempts made with political motives in the wake of the election cannot be accepted. (I) Haven’t either tried to set up any institutions in foreign countries, or did talk about such possibilities with anyone.

From 16,000 daily samplings a week ago, it is now 34,000 samples per day. Amid increasing cases, chief minister Ashok Gehlot held a review meeting and directed officials to constitute a group of doctors to conduct research on all aspect of the second wave and prepare a strategy for saving the state from its effect. He directed officials to ensure that new guidelines should be effectively implemented. He said re-emphasis should be done on intensive screening, contact tracing, testing, and also on preventive measures such as face masks, following social distancing and washing hands. Gehlot said for prevention from second wave, vaccination and precautions, both are equally important. People who already have vaccinated should continue using face masks. After six days of continuous increase in Covid-19 daily new infection, the state reported a dip on Tuesday as 480 infections were reported. The health department is alert on the rise and has increased surveillance. “We have increased the number of daily tests,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary (health). Active cases have risen to 4,262, which were 1,304 on March 1. Cases are too constantly increasing with spike in infections. Though cases are on the rise, the number of serious patients are not rising in that proportion. “In our hospital, 67 Covid patients are currently undergoing treatment and out of those one only patient is on ventilator and six are in the ICU. But, we can’t say whet the situation in future will be. So people should continue taking precaution to ward off the risk of getting infected,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, dedicated Covid RUHS Hospital. In the last three days, 17 Covid deaths have been reported. In the last 24 hours, four persons died, while 480 others tested positive, taking the fatality count to 2,807 and cases to 3,26,506.

The Goa Football Association has informed its executive committee members and all participating clubs that matches in the league are either fixed or manipulated. “Since the start of the season, our data and integrity partners Genius Sports have alerted us to several matches which they have strong indications have been fixed and/or otherwise manipulated for betting purposes. This is simply unacceptable,” GFA general secretary Jovito Lopes wrote in a confidential note to members on Tuesday. According to sources, at least three matches in the ongoing Goa Professional League have come under the scanner for alleged match-fixing. Reports of suspicious betting patterns and alleged match-fixing in Goan football comes a year after GFA was alerted by another betting watchdog, London-based Sportradar, that six games played between October 16, 2019 and November 19, 2019 were highly suspicious. “These things should not happen in football, but we do not have any proof right now. We will see what happens. It is not the clubs (who are involved in match-fixing), but players could be directly involved,” GFA president Churchill Alemao told TOI. One of the suspicious matches is understood to be a clash between defending champions Churchill Brothers FC and Salgaocar FC on February 2. The match was goalless until the 63rd minute when Salgaocar broke the deadlock and went on to score five in the next 27 minutes. Alemao, who owns Churchill Brothers, was incensed with his team's performance and later made changes to the coaching staff. “The players who didn’t play well were not given a chance again. We brought in Armando (Colaco) who is a very good coach and he has soon improved the team. We want him for next season as well,” said Alemao. Those who have watched the games regularly this season say several other matches are being looked at suspiciously with players either having an easy run towards the rival goal, or even scoring own goals. The GFA has now started collecting evidence and asked all stakeholders to come forward, if they were approached, or if they were in the know of malpractices. “The GFA is treating such evidence with the highest levels of importance and urgency and, alongside Genius Sports, are in the process of investigating each match in accordance with GFA's new Ethics Code,” said Lopes. The Ethics Code was adopted at last week’s executive committee meeting. “Every participant and stakeholder in football in Goa is responsible for maintaining the integrity of our matches and competitions, without which football in the region shall quickly lose all credibility and commercial opportunities,” said Lopes, adding that competitions committee chairman Dominic Pereira has been appointed as a single point contact for all integrity matters. For a year since the match-fixing suspicions were red-flagged, the GFA did not initiate a probe or move ahead with its investigation. There was one probe that saw the association point an accusing finger at its own partner. Till last week, matches were being played behind closed doors at the Duler Football Stadium in Mapusa due to the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 12 teams are taking part in a single leg format with 66 matches being lined-up. Even though fans were not allowed, the Goa Pro League has drawn big interest with live broadcast for every match this season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/football-matches-in-goa-undermatch-fixing-spotlight-yet-again/articleshow/81658755.cms||---

With this, life insurers will be allowed to obtain customer’s consent through electronic means for all products till September 30, 2021. IRDAI’s decision comes at a time when Covid-19 cases have been rising again in the country. Similarly, it has allowed life insurers to continue to issue soft copies of policy documents till September 30. Even as the regulator has allowed life insurers to do away with sending hard copies, it has stated that in case the policyholder wishes to have one, it will have to be provided by the life insurance company. “… Consent of the policyholder to receive electronic policy bond is required. If a policyholder insists on hard copy, the same has to be issued without any charges,” the circular added. The regulator has also stated that the insurance company must confirm the date of receipt of electronic policy documents by the policyholder and preserve the proof so that the ‘free look’ period may be calculated from that date. As per the regulator, a 30-day free-look period will be allowed for all such electronic policy documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/life-insurers-to-issue-e-policy-till-sept/articleshow/81657781.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Children get mild Covid, but turn carriers: Report||HYDERABAD: Many students have been hit by Covid- 19. Going by the central government’s analysis, parents can breathe easy for children, but not for themselves as their wards are “carriers of infection”. The Union government, in a report, said an analysis of Covid-infected people in the 0-14 year olds shows that it was less crippling in the age-group. “The infection is not only mild, but they are asymptomatic,” the report added. The government said multi-system inflammatory syndrome was detected among them. AIIMS-Delhi is preparing a study on impact of Covid-19 on children. Going by the analysis that children were safe, but carry infection as asymptomatic carriers, the elderly and parents with comorbidities at home could be infected. State had 6.94% cases of people in the age-group of 61-70 getting, while another 2.47% people in the age-group of 71-80. Health department, after giving a report on situation in educational institutes to the government, suggested closure of them temporarily. The government even announced the decision in the assembly on Tuesday. Also, a team of officials has been sent to border districts to understand the situation and observe things at primary health care centres (PHCs). Hyderabad: In Bellampalli of Mancherial district, another Covid-19 cluster came to light. At the Government Polytechnic College, 146 people, including staff and students, were tested and samples of 20 people came back positive. Among those who tested positive, 12 were staff and eight students. Officials have sent them for isolation facility. Due to the increased number of cases in educational institutes, Nirmal, which had reported zero cases some time ago, reported 32 cases in the last 24 hours, next only to GHMC in the number of cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/children-get-mild-covid-but-turn-carriers-report/articleshow/81657787.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Back to e-school again as Telangana shuts all classes from today||HYDERABAD: A surge in the novel coronavirus cases, particularly among students, forced the Telangana government on Tuesday to shut down all educational institutions in the state again, barring medical colleges, from Wednesday onwards. Online classes and distance learning will continue as earlier during the shutdown period. With health authorities already announcing that Telangana is on the verge of a second wave of Covid-19, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao took stock of the situation and ordered the shutdown. “As number of coronavirus cases are being reported from residential schools and students in schools are testing positive, the government has taken a decision to shut them down temporarily,” chief secretary Somesh Kumar told TOI. Over the past week, at least 600 students across private and state-run schools and residential facilities have tested positive for the virus, worrying parents and authorities. The second round of closure of schools due to Covid-19 came just 51 days after they reopened on February 1 after a gap of 10 months, since the nationwide lockdown was announced in March 2020. “All educational institutions in Telangana including schools, colleges, hostels, gurukuls in the government and private sector will be closed. However, medical colleges have been exempted from the shutdown orders,” another official said. Telangana education minister Sabitha Indra Reddy made an announcement to this effect on the floor of the Assembly on Tuesday, saying that the decision was taken after careful examination of rising cases and many representations from parents. “The government will wait and watch before taking any decision on extending the shutdown or reviving offline classes. No decision has been taken on the postponement of any examinations,” she said, indicating that they may be conducted as per schedule if coronavirus is kept under check.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/back-to-e-school-again-as-t-shuts-all-classes-from-today/articleshow/81658770.cms||Roushan Ali

Several trees were uprooted and fell on roads while many colonies in the city witnessed abrupt power cuts. Rainfall in several districts also guided mercury to dip by almost 4°C. Attributing the change in weather to active upper air cyclonic circulation and western disturbances, Jaipur Met office said similar conditions would prevail in eastern and northern parts of the state in the next 24 hours. In Jaipur, people witnessed high-velocity winds followed by dust storm and rainfall in the afternoon. Trees, electric poles and hoardings were uprooted everywhere due to the strong winds. “Due to overcast skies, I could see the street lights switched on at 4pm on Tuesday,” said Janesh Singh, who got stuck on the way to his home at Statue Circle. Many localities in the city including Jhotwara, Khatipura, Murlipura, Sikar Road and colonies adjoining Ajmer Road, Raja Park, Jawahar Nagar and Mansarovar witnessed power cuts, which lasted for more than one hour. Likewise, at the Kisan Mahapanchayat at Vidyadhar Nagar, the tents got uprooted. One youth was injured in the rally after a pole fell on him. When contacted, Jaipur Met office director Radhey Shyam Sharma said, “March is the transition from winters to summers. The available moisture along with the western disturbances bring thunder showers and dust storms. But why this has been happening since 2017 during March 15 to April 15 at many places in the state is being researched by the scientists of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi.” At many areas, bikes and other vehicles parked on the roads got stuck under the trees that fell on them. Civic authorities and teams of civil defence were on the job of removing the uprooted trees and sign boards from the roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dust-storm-rain-hit-life-in-city-met-says-more-to-come/articleshow/81658759.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||‘Daily supply of quality water better than free water’||By R Murali Realising the dream of making Hyderabad a global destination cannot be possible without ensuring water security for the current and future generations. Hyderabad has been experiencing rapid population growth -- it has increased almost six times -- from about 18.20 lakh in 1971 to nearly 1.20 crores in the current year. For a long time, Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar served as main sources of water supply to meet the drinking, domestic and other water needs of the city. But, over the past four decades massive infrastructure has been created to lift and pump water from almost all major rivers around the city that include Manjira, Singur, Krishna (Phase I, II, III) and Godavari. Currently about 448 MGD of water is being supplied to meet the needs of 10.60 lakh water connections (domestic – 10.18 lakhs, commercial-36,000, bulk and industries -2110, public stand posts-3600, approx). The total serviced area is about 1451.91 sq km (173.83 sq km core city area, 483.08 sq km peripheral circle area and 795 sq km ORR villages area). It is estimated that the HMWS&SB is spending about USD 16.60 million every month as its operational cost of which USD 10.83 million is spent only on electricity for pumping and supplying water. Heavy subsidies are also being extended to domestic users by charging only 10% of its expenditure. Recently the state government even declared free supply of 20,000 liters of water per month that can be availed of by all domestic-slum, domestic-individual, domestic-multi-storeyed building/bulk connections. Reliable sources say that out of the total water supplied by the board, about 40% is unaccounted for. Of this about 20 million gallons appear to be physical losses incurred every day -- mostly at supply areas and customer locations. The water wastage is leading to road damages, contamination and also causing unhygienic conditions apart from indirect economic loss suffered by the board. In addition to this, almost every residential, commercial and industrial property in the city has borewell within its premises that are heavily exploiting groundwater. In the past 10 years, transporting water by tankers from peripheral/ peri-urban areas, often denying water for agriculture, has become a major supply source. Sale of water cans at the doorstep and in grocery stores, labelled as ‘treated safe water’, has been rapidly expanding without any regulation and quality assurance checks. Even after exhausting all possible sources, the city is continuing to face an acute water crisis. Daily water supply has been replaced by supply on alternate days as a crisis management strategy. Now this has become a permanent feature of the water supply, while there are many parts of the city surviving with water supply once in four to seven days. Inequities in supply due to a variety of technical, social and political reasons and corrupt practices are major challenges confronted mostly by people living in slums and other poor neighbourhoods. Establishing a sustainable water management and governance system for Hyderabad, promoting consumer awareness and rigorous use of registering complaints and online grievance redressal mechanisms, promoting 100% treatment of sewage and waste water and popularising reuse of treated water, are some of the urgent measures that need to be taken going forward. It is also important to create awareness, advocate community-led control measures to eliminate abuse and wastage of water, establish citizens vigilance committees to monitor water supply and hold the state accountable for delivering on its commitments of assured water supply. The people in Hyderabad would be a lot happier with reliable quality of water supplied on a daily basis, rather than free water supply that may threaten the financial sustainability of water supply utilities and also dilute the rights of consumers and accountability of duty bearers.

Police apprehend that at least four more minor girls might have fallen victim to his lust, but their parents were yet to lodge any case yet.  The incident took place under Kajra police station area of the district. An FIR has been lodged against Tanti by the victim’s mother with Women’s police station in Lakhisarai.  Women’s police station SHO Rita Kumari said besides the victim, a five-year-old girl was also raped by the accused, but her parents were not ready to lodge a complaint. “Police came to know that at least four more minor girls in the village might have been raped by the accused,” she said. The SHO said it was first a five-year-old girl, who had complained to her mother against the accused on Monday for touching her body parts when she had gone to his shop.  “When the villagers came to know about it, the seven-year-old girl’s mother quizzed her as she has been continuously remaining ill for the last 20 days. She had even complained of pain in her private parts, but her mother probably failed to understand the gravity of the situation,” the SHO said. She said Tanti, who runs a general store in the village, had taken the victim to a secluded place on the outskirts of the village in the name of giving her peas. “There he raped the girl, who returned home silently and fell sick,” the SHO said. She said the girl’s medical examination was conducted on Tuesday and the accused was forwarded in judicial custody. The SHO said the five-year-old girl’s parents are educated and run a business in Lakhisarai while the seven-year-old girl’s mother is uneducated and her father works as a daily wager outside Bihar. “Tanti lived in the village with his wife and son. Further investigation is going on,” the SHO added.

---||Hyderabad||Gangavaram Port deal gives Adani 58% stake||Hyderabad: The Adani group inched closer to taking control of Visakhapatnam-based Gangavaram Port Ltd (GPL) with Adani Port and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) inking an agreement with the private port’s promoters, DVS Raju and family, to acquire their 58.1% stake for Rs 3,604 crore. The agreement, signed on Tuesday, comes just days after APSEZ signed a deal to acquire Warburg Pincus’ 31.5% stake in GPL for Rs 1,954 crore and will take the Adani group’s stake to 89.6% in the Visakhapatnam-based port operator. Adani group’s acquisition of Gangavaram Port comes barely six months after it completed the acquisition of controlling stake (75%) in another AP-based private port – Krishnapatnam Port for an enterprise value of Rs 12,000 crore. The latest acquisition is part of the Gujarat-based port company's strategy to transform into a pan-India cargo utility from a predominantly west coast port company. The acquisition of the GPL promoter’s 30 crore shares will be done at Rs 120 per share, the same price for which Adani acquired the Warburg Pincus stake in the AP-based port operator. The transaction is subject to the requisite regulatory approvals, including those from the Andhra Pradesh government, which holds 10.4% stake in the port, and the Competition Commission of India, and is expected to be completed in six months, APSEZ said. “The acquisition is in line with the company’s strategy of east coast to west coast parity and will provide an access to growth from new hinterland markets as it has coverage in resource rich and industrial belt in eastern, central and southern India,” the Adani group company said in a regulatory filing to the bourses on Tuesday. Pointing out that GPL has the potential to emerge as a 250 MMT port with 31 berths, APSEZ CEO & wholetime director Karan Adani said that the acquisition of GPL was a further augmentation of the Adani group’s vision to capitalise on an expanded logistics network effect that generates greater value as it expands. The all-weather multipurpose port located in north Andhra, close to Visakhapatnam port, is touted as India’s deepest port with a water depth of around 21 metres and can handle fully laden super cape sized vessels of up to 2,00,000 DWT. It has a total capacity of 64 MMT but handled 34.8 MMT of cargo in 2019-20 and clocked revenue of Rs 1,082 crore. The port currently operates nine berths and has a free hold land of 1,800 acres. It handles a mix of dry and bulk commodities including coal, iron ore, fertilisers, limestone, bauxite, sugar, alumina and steel. GPL, which was incorporated in September 2001 under concession from the AP government that extends till 2059, is a gateway port for a hinterland spread over eight states across eastern, southern and central India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gangavaram-port-deal-gives-adani-58-stake/articleshow/81658769.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The teachers who perform duties during vacation period are entitled to get earned leave as 1/3rd of the period, if any, during which he/she is required to perform duties during vacation,” states the circular. The benefit will be available to teachers of government and aided secondary and higher secondary schools. Director of education Santosh Amonkar has told school heads to credit such earned leave in the service book of the teachers by calculating it as per the days of service rendered during the vacation time. The directorate has asked school heads to verify the attendance certificate issued by the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education before calculating the leave. “Due to the pandemic situation, the academic year has been delayed, which results in delayed public exams of HSSC and SSC conducted by Goa Board. As per the datesheet issued by Goa Board, the HSSC exam will be partly conducted in the academic year and SSC 2021 will be conducted during summer vacation,” the DoE has said.

Girl found dead, sister hanging from tree in UP||PILIBHIT: In a grim reminder to the 2014 Budaun gang rape and murder of two teenage girls, two sisters — aged 17 and 20 — were found dead under suspicious circumstances near a brick kiln where they were working in a village under Bisalpur kotwali in Pilibhit district. The body of the elder sister was found dumped in a field — 400 metres from the kiln — late on Monday night, while the body of the younger sister was found hanging from a eucalyptus tree just at a stone’s throw away from the spot on Tuesday morning. Police rushed to the spot. Soon, senior police officers, including inspector general (Bareilly range) Rajesh Kumar Pandey, SP Jai Prakash Yadav and ASP Pavitra Mohan Tripathi, also visited the village to take stock of the situation. The autopsy was conducted by a panel of three doctors, including a woman doctor, following the orders of district magistrate Pulkit Khare. It confirmed that the elder sister was strangled while the younger one died by hanging. The autopsy has ruled out rape, said SP Jai Prakash Yadav. “Police have collected crucial evidence that will help nail the accused,” he said. “Surprisingly, the family spotted the body of the elder sister around 9.30 pm, and they then carried it to their house, but none of them informed police,” said the SP. “We have detained two youths, including brick kiln supervisor Mahesh Kumar (25), who are said to have been close to the girls. Besides, we have found a mobile phone lying close to the body of the elder sister. The SIM card inserted into the phone was issued to the name of Mahesh,” said the SP, adding that they would crack the case soon. Both sisters had gone out of their makeshift house on the brick kiln campus around 7 pm on Monday, but did not return, said their family members, adding that they thought they were going out to answer nature’s call. According to police sources, the girls’ family originally belong to a village under Bilsanda police station. Their father had passed away six years ago due to illness and their four elder sisters were married off. They were living with their mother and two brothers — aged 23 and 19 — all working as labours at the brick kiln for the past four years. The IG told TOI that the rope with which the body was hanging was cut from a nearby field. “The landowner has encircled his plot with ropes to keep animals away. While searching the girls’ house, police came across a sickle that had traces of the rope. Police have seized the rope and the sickle for a forensic examination,” added the IG.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/budaun-rerun-two-sisters-found-dead-in-pilibhit-village-one-lying-on-field-other-hanging-from-tree/articleshow/81656811.cms||Keshav Agarwal

Gehlot tweeted, “Bangalore doctor Devi Shetty’s suggestion of vaccinating people from 24 years to 45 years urgently seems to be right as these people go out of their houses for work and can become super spreaders.” While Rajasthan is witnessing a sudden spike in cases, Gehlot urged the Centre for scaling up vaccination drive by posting a series of tweets on it. “India has a capacity of manufacturing vaccines in large quantity and it should be used,” he tweeted. Recently, Gehlot had held a series of meeting through video conferencing with religious leaders, NGOs, politicians, representatives of political parties and different departments of the state government on containing the spread of the virus, after which decisions of night curfew in eight cities and making Covid negative report for all travelers from other states entering in Rajasthan were taken. Apart from it, a lot of decisions have also been taken including preparation for institutional quarantine and strict measures against people flouting norms. Now, Gehlot has appealed to the Centre to provide vaccines to states to prevent the second wave from affecting the lives of people. “I appeal to the government of India to provide vaccines in more and more quantities to curb the second wave. One more lockdown will be disastrous for livelihood,” he tweeted. City-based doctors who are providing Covid treatment to patients also appealed for scaling up vaccination drive. “Ideally, there are two ways to develop antibodies against Covid — one is by getting infection and second by immunisation. It’s better to get vaccinated. While conducting vaccination, there is a methodology which has to be followed. So, those who are at risk of death, should get the vaccine first,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, head of core group of Covid treatment of the state government. Bhandari said, “Vaccination will save people from death, but it will not save from asymptomatic infection. However, it is wiser step to vaccinate the whole population by making the drive as fast as possible. The biggest advantage of fast vaccination will be that it will not only reduce spread of infections but also it will bring down chances of virus developing new variant and mutations.” “Since the cases are increasing, it is high time that vaccination should not be limited to certain categories, but should be opened for all eligible persons, irrespective of age. But it all depends on availability of vaccine doses,” Dr Ajit Singh, member of core Covid treatment group of the state, said. “The majority of the Indian population is between 18 and 40 years. To break the chain of transmission and to ensure public safety, it is imperative that the next vaccination drive targets this population,” said Dr Charu Sukhlecha, consultant, critical care at a private hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-asks-centre-to-vaccinate-people-between-24-45-yrs/articleshow/81658767.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Allahabad HC seeks forest authorities' reply on disobedience of its order on framing rules for recruitment of special tiger protection force||Pilibhit: Hearing a contempt petition filed before the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court, a single judge bench of Justice Sangeeta Chandra has directed the forest authorities, including the principal secretary, to explain reasons for the disobedience of its previous order on framing rules for the recruitment of the special tiger protection force (STPF) in the state. The court has fixed the next date of hearing on April 2. Speaking with TOI, petitioner Satish Kumar Mishra, a senior HC lawyer, said he had filed a writ petition in 2016 against the Union of India and the state of UP for the constitution of an exclusive STPF of the forest department for the tiger reserves in the state, urging the HC to direct the government to frame rules for the direct recruitment of STPF to eliminate the system of forming an STPF by hiring policemen from other departments on deputation. “The STPF formed by hiring policemen is governed by its principal department, and thus, the STPF personnel do not carry out their duties of the protection and conservation of forest and wildlife with their fullest commitment. Besides, in case of any dispute, the matter is normally referred to the principal department of the policemen that creates hurdles in taking prompt action,” Mishra said.An STPF comprising 112 personnel of PAC (Provincial Armed Constabulary) on deputation for three years was provided to the Dudhwa tiger reserve in October 2018 but it failed to produce the desired results, as many cases of illegal felling of trees and deaths of tigers, rhinos and elephants were reported even after their deployment, he claimed.As UP had no exclusive rules for recruiting policemen and personnel for the STPF, said Mishra, he urged the HC to issue an order in the common interest of the forest and wildlife.After a series of hearings, a division bench of Justices Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Manish Kumar on February 7, 2020 had granted three months to the principal secretary (forest) to frame the rules and file a compliance report, said Mishra, adding that though the next date of hearing was fixed in May, it could not take place due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.“After I learnt through correspondence that the forest authorities had not only failed in ensuring the compliance with the court order, but the principal secretary had also not deposited a penalty of Rs 25,000 slapped on him by the court, I was compelled to file the contempt petition,” said the petitioner.Following the court’s directions, he provided a hard copy of the contempt petition to the chief standing counsel of the state, added Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/allahabad-hc-seeks-forest-authorities-reply-on-disobedience-of-its-order-on-framing-rules-for-recruitment-of-special-tiger-protection-force/articleshow/81656822.cms||Keshav Agarwal

This is because a majority of people testing positive are showing mild to moderate symptoms, which does not require hospital stay. Among the PMR constituents, areas coming under the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had 21,438 (88%) of its total 24,440 active cases staying in home care till Tuesday. Similarly, of the 11,922 active patients in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits, 9,942 (83%) were in home quarantine. In the rural and cantonment areas, 2,507 (40%) patients were in home isolation as against 3,781 in hospitals, making it the only exception to the trend. Data shows that in September last year, only 40% of the PMR’s over 40,000 active cases were in home isolation. An official from the PMC’s health department said, “We are observing more patients preferring home isolation even as the cases are increasing every day. Patients in home isolation are showing mild symptoms. We expect them to complete their quarantine period diligently.” Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of the Pune Zilla Parishad, said, “A strategy has been adopted to get patients admitted in Covid care centres and district health centres, which will help us manage them better.” Sources from the health sector said doctors and hospitals had started home isolation consultations. “These patients hardly require hospitalization during the quarantine period. Doctors guide them on what measures they are expected to follow and the parameters they should follow,” a health official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/now-80-active-cases-in-city-in-home-isolation/articleshow/81657798.cms||Sarang Dastane

Seeking a nationwide attention to the issue, KCBC issued a statement on Tuesday and demanded legal action against the attackers. KCBC also said that the police had taken them into custody without any reason based on the allegations raised by the attackers and tried to frame the nuns in fake charges of forcible religious conversion. KCBC stated that the incident questioned the safety assured by India Railways to women passengers and the rights granted by the Constitution. “Despite confirming that the allegations were false after checking the ID cards and documents provided by the nuns, the police took them into custody without the presence of women police officers. They forced the nuns to alight at a station not familiar to them at night and insulted them. Detailed investigations must be initiated into the incident by national human rights and women commissions,” the statement said. The nuns and the postulants, belonging to Sacred Heart congregation in Delhi province were travelling from Nizamuddin in Delhi to Odisha when the incident happened. The postulants were going to their houses in Rourkela for the first time since joining the congregation recently. Bajrang Dal workers, who boarded the train from Rishikesh, raised allegations of forced religious conversion against the nuns after seeing the postulants with the nuns. Later, the Bajrang Dal workers called the railway police and alleged that the nuns were taking the postulants for forcible religious conversion. The police detained them and reportedly attempted to book them under the religious conversion prevention law enacted by the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh. The nuns were released only after senior police officers and Church authorities intervened. The church alleged that it was a pre-planned attack as nearly 150 Bajrang Dal activists assembled at Jhansi within minutes of the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kcbc-condemns-attack-on-nuns-in-uttar-pradesh/articleshow/81657803.cms||---
---||Mumbai||TB cases down by 40% in 5 yrs in Parel; 241 patients tested +ve in 2020 in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Tuberculosis detection in Mumbai dropped by 30% in 2020 due to lockdown imposed due to Covid-19. From 60,597 new TB patients diagnosed in 2019, the number dropped to 43,464, according to data released by BMC on the eve of World TB Day. Also, Covid affected only 241 registered TB patients in the city in 2020. TimesViewThe Centre’s recognition for BMC’s efforts to fight TB is good news, but a lot needs to be done before we can eliminate TB. It continues to be one of the leading causes for death in India, including Mumbai. There is a need to upgrade diagnostics so that TB is caught at the earliest and people get quicker access to new life-saving drugs. More government and business funding is needed to innovate and check the old pestilence.There is, however, good news in the TB sphere in 2021. “Detections have normalised this year, with over 5,000 new patients detected in January and February each,” said Dr Pranita Tipre, in-charge of TB in Mumbai. Four TB districts in Mumbai where the largest anti-TB fight was launched in 2012 after the discovery of extremely drug resistant TB cases have won central government recognition for reducing the disease burden. While Parel TB district has bagged a silver medal for reducing the incidence by 40%, three Ghatkopar, Prabhadevi and Grant Road have bagged bronze for reducing the incidence by 20%. India has set a goal of eliminating TB by 2025. While there was widespread concern in 2020 about the impact of Covid-19 on TB, statistics show the incidence of Covid-19 among TB patients was not as high as feared. In 2020, only 241 of the 13,155 TB patients tested for Covid turned positive. While no deaths were registered due to Covid in 2020, in the last three months, three TB patients died due to Covid. Around 42 out of 1,956 TB patients were tested in 2021 so far. BMC statistics for 2020-2021 showed that the number of drug-resistant TB patients continued to be roughly 10% of the total TB burden. In 2020, only 4,367 out of the 43,464 TB patients had multi-drug resistant TB. Extremely drug resistant TB affected 200 in Mumbai in 2020. The BMC team also said over 90,000 people were tested for TB in 2020. “This proves that the system worked well, but people from outside the city who seek treatment here could not make it due to lockdown,” Dr Tipre added. BMC has not released TB deaths data as it is still being computed, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/tb-cases-down-by-40-in-5-yrs-in-parel-241-patients-tested-ve-in-2020-in-mumbai/articleshow/81657895.cms||---

The ODP has a horizon period of 10 years. So, what is the need of the new ODP?” Sardesai said, while speaking to reporters after the meeting of the SGPDA where the proposal was put forth. Kamat also called into question the need for the new ODP when the SGPDA is yet to prepare a comprehensive development plan (CDP) based on the earlier notified ODP as per the provisions of the TCP Act. He also raised objection to the move of preparing a new ODP without preparing the land-use map as required under the statute. SGPDA chairman Wilfred D’Sa said that a decision to prepare a revised ODP was taken at its meeting held 4-5 months back as the Authority had received several complaints pertaining to roads and zoning. “The chief town planner has given his approval for preparation of the new ODP,” D’Sa said. Earlier, explaining the “irregularities” in the Margao ODP, D’Sa had said, “There are instances where places lying between a settlement zone on one side and a commercial zone on the other have been omitted from the zoning exercise. Overhauling of the ODP is therefore required.” The ODPs-2028 of Margao and Ponda planning areas were notified by the state government in March 2019 under provisions contained in the Town and Country Planning Act, 1974. The Margao ODP was approved by the SGPDA headed by D’Sa’s predecessor Renuka Da Silva when Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai was the minister for town and country planning (TCP) department. D’Sa, who was among the 10 Congress turncoat MLAs led by Chandrakant Kavlekar who had defected to the BJP, was awarded the SGPDA chairmanship. He assumed office in October 2019, after Kavlekar had succeeded Sardesai as the TCP minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kamat-sardesai-slam-sgpda-proposal-to-prepare-new-margao-odp-notified-in-2019/articleshow/81657799.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The main accused in the case Balmoor mandal tahsildar, M Radha Krishna, is yet to be arrested. According to ACB officials, the tahsildar along with the three VROs, demanded the bribe to send a favourable report to the collector for the allotment of five acre government land to the complainant. An ACB team caught the three VROs red-handed when they accepted the bribe from the complainant at the agricultural field of VRO Balanarayana in Lakkaram village of Nagarkurnool district.

Sawant’s budget is likely to focus on the road map for the state during the next one year, while revolving around the concept of Swayampurna Goa. “I will present the budget at 2.30pm on Wednesday,” Sawant told reporters at the ministerial block, after the cabinet meeting. When asked what his budget would focus on, Sawant said, “I cannot reveal everything today (Tuesday). Wait for Wednesday.” With the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, and the state is facing a financial crisis, it would be interesting to see how the chief minister balances his budget between election promises and financial management of the state. A political observer said that Sawant could present an election-oriented budget to lure all sections of the society ahead of assembly polls. It would be interesting to see if Sawant reduces the VAT on petrol to give some relief to common man, he said. “His budget could be also development-oriented and focusing on employment generation, as the state will face elections in the next year,” the political observer said. During the legislative assembly’s 13-day working session, the state government will answer around 1,571 questions - including 568 starred and 1,003 unstarred. The government will also introduce six bills before the assembly session ends on April 16. A senior officer said that they have received three private member bills and they are expecting some more. Besides discussion on bills and question hour, calling attention and zero hour motions will also be part of the session. While there are no major issues in the state, the opposition will try to corner the treasury benches on the Mhadei water dispute, Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP), mining, coal handling and the three linear projects at Mollem, which include double tracking, widening of the national highway and the Tamnar power transmission line. During the last assembly session, the debate on the three linear stretched past midnight, however, the government did not give any assurance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-eye-on-2022-polls-cm-likely-to-present-populist-budget-today/articleshow/81658768.cms||Murari Shetye

The matter was brought to the notice of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), through TOI’s citizen reporter app, on March 16. "The issue has been resolved, I thank authorities for resolving it and TOI and for helping us bring it to their notice," said Neha Mishra, the citizen reporter. According to locals, the poor sanitation standards of the area had forced around 100 families to stay indoors. "We had no choice but to stay put in our homes. We couldn’t even go out for a walk as the trash was piled up for more than a week. We had to ensure our doors and windows were closed round the clock due to the rancid smell," said Nehad Khan, a resident of Masab Tank. Lashing out the authorities for their apathy, a senior citizen from the area said that the government should be accountable in case vector-borne diseases are reported from Vijay Nagar Colony. "Residents were constantly living in fear of falling ill. The government should take responsibility if cases of dengue and malaria are reported from here. Until cleaned out last week, the garbage pile had turned into a breeding spot for mosquitoes," the resident said. Following the clean-up, civic officials said that garbage was removed from multiple places. "But the next day, many places saw fresh cases of garbage-dumping," said MK Ali, deputy commissioner (GHMC), Mehdipatnam circle urging people to also be conscious. Meanwhile, multiple places in the city have been facing the garbage issue after civic officials removed the existing bins ahead of Swachh Survekshan Rankings 2021.

The demand for beds is increasing following the rise in Covid-19 cases, a civic official said. “We have urged the private hospitals to reserve the beds. If they don’t provide the adequate facilities, we shall take over the designated number of beds,” Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal said. Some private hospitals had expressed inability to provide more beds for the Covid-19 treatment citing that they were reserved for planned surgeries, a civic official said. The Pune civic administration conducted a meeting with the authorities of the private hospitals on Monday and brief them about the existing situation. “The private hospitals have been cooperating to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.Many private hospitals been treating the Covid-19 patients, even after the number of patients had reduced. Some of the hospitals have reserved a floor for Covid-19 patients. The civic body should appreciate our efforts,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India’s Pune chapter. Altogether 3,937 beds have been allocated for Covid-19 patients in the civic limits. Of those, 578 beds are vacant. These include 31 ICU beds without ventilator support, 48 with ventilator support, 321 with oxygen support and 178 isolation beds. The PMC has told the private hospitals to keep 50% beds reserved for treatment of Covid-19 positive patients, which will make 1,600 more beds available for patients. In February, the PMC had told all private hospitals in its jurisdiction to reserve a total of 2,000 beds for Covid-19 patients. The civic body had also told the hospitals that no Covid patient should be denied admission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-plans-to-take-over-beds-in-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/81657804.cms||---

We are looking at the situation, based on which a decision will be taken.” Health minister Vishwajit Rane on Monday had also said that there is need to put in place strict standard operating procedures (SOPs) before the Covid-19 situation in the state gets out of hand. “I am in touch with the health minister and at present no decision to this effect has been taken,” Sawant said. The state has been witnessing a steady rise in cases. On Monday, 84 new cases were detected, while on the previous day, Sunday, the cases had crossed the 100 mark. On Tuesday again, Goa clocked 133 new cases. But Sawant put the ball in the public’s court. “We have to take care, as also the tourists. We cannot stop all economic activities once again,” he said. He, however, said that as a means of tackling the situation, the state has upped testing, but added that Covid-responsible behaviour continues to remain important. “I request all Goans to maintain social distancing and use masks,” he said, adding that the government may think of revising the fine for not wearing masks. He also said that those who have any symptoms should go for testing and those who are eligible to take the vaccine should take the shot. With regards to the Shigmo parade planned to be held at three places — Ponda, Panaji and Mapusa — Sawant said, “I have not held any discussion on the matter, but if cases increase by a large number, then we will have to think about it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-need-for-entry-checks-says-cm-as-covid-cases-deaths-rise/articleshow/81658783.cms||---
---||Kochi||ED moves HC against FIR||Kochi: The legality of Kerala Police’s FIR against Enforcement Directorate (ED) will now be considered by the high court with the ED filing a petition to quash the FIR that alleges gold smuggling accused Swapna Suresh was forced by ED officials to name chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the case. The petition was filed by ED Cochin zone deputy director P Radhakrishnan against the FIR registered on March 17 by the Kerala Police crime branch on the basis of the statements of two women police constables guarding Swapna. ED has contended that the FIR was lodged with the malafide intention of derailing the statutory investigation under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). As per the petition, M Sivasankar IAS, who was principal secretary to the chief minister and an accused in the gold smuggling case, has been influencing other accused since he came out on bail and is using the state machinery to fabricate false evidence against the investigating officers of ED. He is using the two women constables to make it appear that the investigating officer is exerting pressure on prime accused to name the chief minister. Swapna’s statement was taken pursuant to a judicial proceeding and the statement has been produced as evidence before the special court under PMLA, ED said. The state police registering the FIR is against law and nothing but an interference in the investigation conducted by ED, the petition said. If the FIR is allowed to subsist, it would cause hindrance to ED’s investigation, the petitioner contends. The FIR is nothing but an abuse of process of law and it needs to be terminated prematurely in the interest of justice, ED said while seeking to quash the FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ed-moves-hc-against-fir/articleshow/81657824.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Rayalaseema farmers await launch of irrigation projects||Amaravati: Farmers in the Kundu river region of Rayalaseema are eagerly waiting for the launch of key irrigation projects including Joladarasi and Rajoli reservoirs. They are worried that a delay in the launch of these projects may compel them to weather another round of inundation during the monsoon. The Kundu river, the third-largest river in the region, floods several villages during every monsoon. A long-pending demand of Rayalaseema farmers, the state government has decided to take up the Joladarasi reservoir project with 0.8tmc capacity across Kundu. The Rajoli reservoir across Kundu on the upstream side of the existing Rajoli anicut was designed with a storage capacity of 2.95tmc. The Joladarasi and Rajoli projects, expected to cost 2,600 crore, are slated to give relief to farmers. The irrigation department has prepared a blueprint for modernisation of local irrigation channels under the new project. It has also proposed to take up flood protection works along with construction of high-level bridges en route to the villages. “We were very happy when the chief minister issued specific instructions to the irrigation department to take up Rajoli and Joladarasi schemes on a priority basis. But work has not begun so far,” said Kamini Venugopala Reddy, chairman of the Kundu river conservation committee and a farmers’ leader. He said that a delay in works would waste one more year as floods in the upcoming monsoon may derail plans. The irrigation department has not been able to begin works even after finalising of tenders nearly four months ago. Sources say that the firm which won the project is reluctant to take up works citing financial reasons. The irrigation department wants to complete both schemes in 36 months. The foundation for Rajoli and Joladarasi schemes were laid back in 2008 by then chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rayalaseema-farmers-await-launch-of-irrigation-projects/articleshow/81638075.cms||Samdani MN
---||Thiruvananthapuram||A feisty youth vs two tried-and-tested veterans||Kozhikode: When a 26-year-old student leader, who had been in the forefront of most of the agitations led by the UDF in the state in recent years, takes on a veteran leader who arguably holds the record for holding mayoral posts for the most number of years in the country, the fight is set to be out-of-the-ordinary. Add to that the entry of one of the most combative leaders of BJP in the state, then you have the perfect recipe for a three-cornered fight in Kozhikode North constituency. The constituency has had the reputation of being a swing constituency which had elected CPM and Congress candidates alternatively for eight elections held from 1957 to 2006 till A Pradeep Kumar of the CPM started off his hat-trick stint, increasing his victory margins with each election. The seat has, however, been throwing up leads for UDF candidates in parliament elections, including 4,558 for M K Raghavan in 2019. Now, with Pradeep Kumar not in the fray due to the two-term norm, Congress has sensed an opportunity and has fielded a young blood in the form of KSU state president K M Abhijith to take on CPM’s candidate and former corporation mayor Thottathil Raveendran who has been mayor of Kozhikode for two terms, deputy mayor for one term and councillor for 26 years. BJP is also making a serious attempt this time by fielding BJP state general secretary M T Ramesh in the constituency, which has in recent years saw the party increasing its vote share substantially. Of the 30 corporation wards in the constituency, BJP has won five and came second in 12, making it a political force to reckon with here. The campaign of Raveendran proceeds like clockwork. At a meeting venue at Ponnamparambu, a crowd of around 70 people, half of them women, waits for the candidate in the scorching sun beneath a tarpaulin sheet at 3pm. A teenager stands ready with flowers to receive the candidate and two DYFI activists hold a set of crackers to be lit on the arrival of the candidate. On reaching the venue, Raveendran keeps his speech short and focuses on the theme to have continuity for the Rs 3,000-crore development works initiated in the constituency by Pradeep Kumar and also pitches for the need to give another term for the LDF government. He also takes on the central government, reminding the housewives that the LPG prices have doubled under the NDA rule. Raveendran, who is a former chairman of Guruvayur devaswom board, has interestingly been a communist and an ardent believer at the same time. “I have been with the people here for over three decades, which is enough to sense their mood. This time they want continuity and don’t want whatever that has been built upon during the last five years to be disrupted. The people now know what it means to have a state government which stands with you in time of crisis like Covid and the floods,” Ravindran told TOI. The campaign of Abhijith, who is one of the youngest in the fray in the state, is a picture in contrast with the front trying to capitalize on his boy-next- door image. While visiting the Kattuvayal colony, which has around 260 voters, he makes a hasty tour of the houses and the candidate does not miss any opportunity to seek blessings from the elderly by touching their feet. “You can consider me as your son, brother or friend. I will be there with you just a call away for all your needs. Even if you don’t call, I will be there around just like your councillor,” Abhijith tells the residents pointing at Congress councillor Alphonsa Mathew, who is accompanying him. “The tall claims of development bandied about by the LDF in the constituency are just a PR stunt. You cannot deceive people for long with such gimmicks,” says Abhijith. BJP is making a massive campaign push for Ramesh by deploying all its resources. Being a senior party leader hailing from the district, Ramesh too doesn’t need an introduction. “The political situation is in favour of the BJP this time. The contest here is between LDF and the BJP. We are the only party that has registered growth in the recently held local body elections. The CPM has failed the people of the constituency despite the people electing the party for three terms. Also, the current LDF candidate has got several opportunities to do something substantial but has failed to deliver. So, the people are willing to give a chance to the development politics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” says Ramesh. The electorate in the constituency comprises around 60% Hindus and the rest constituted by 25% Muslims and 15% Christians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/a-feisty-youth-vs-two-tried-and-tested-veterans/articleshow/81657813.cms||---
---||Nagpur||India needs to generate 83% power from renewable means||Nagpur: India would need to generate at least 83% of its electricity from (non-hydropower) renewable sources sources by 2050, if it was to commit to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century. This would mean a massive 55-fold increase in use of non-hydro renewables in electricity generation within the coming three decades, from only 160 Terawatt-hour (TWh) (10%) in 2019.This was revealed in a first-of-its-kind analysis, ‘Peaking and Net Zero for India’s Energy Sector CO2 emissions’, released by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), an Asia-based policy research institute. The study examines key variables that would influence the country’s choice of peaking year and net-zero year for its carbon dioxide emissions related to the energy sector. It accounts for 88% of the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions.The study highlights that to achieve net-zero by 2050 the share of electricity in India’s industrial energy use must rise three-fold, from 20.3% in 2018 to 70% in 2050. “The share of electric vehicles in passenger car sales would also have to rise to 76% in 2050 from just 0.1% in 2019. The country would need to reach peak emissions within this decade if it was to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century, a pace of transition unlike anything the world has seen before,” the study said.Pointing out that achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 or 2060 would need rapid systemic changes across all sectors, the study said, “It would be equally important for India to closely examine trade-offs such as increasing cost of household electricity, increasing railways passenger fares, fiscal challenges for coal-dependent states, job losses for over half a million coal mining workers, and the shifting geopolitics around energy trade and the energy transition before announcing its net-zero targets.”Explaining the findings, CEEW fellow Vaibhav Chaturvedi, who is also author of the study, said, “We find that India would need to undergo a double transition through faster electrification of sectors and an increasing share of renewables in power generation, if it was to announce an ambitious net-zero target. Policymakers would also need to identify manufacturing sectors where electricity could replace fossil fuels. Reducing the cost of electricity to make it competitive would be equally critical. Finally, the rate of decline in India’s emission intensity of primary energy would have to be ramped up drastically to peak within the coming two decades.”Stating that the country has already demonstrated climate leadership, CEO of CEEW Arunabha Ghosh said, “It is the only G20 nation on track to surpass its Paris Agreement targets. However, if India has to announce a net-zero target, it must choose a year that not only minimises climate impacts but also gives it enough space to develop.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/india-needs-to-generate-83-power-from-renewable-means/articleshow/81657808.cms||Manka Behl

---||Pune||New traffic police office soon to curb congestion on Ahmednagar & Solapur highways: Pune CP||Pune: Commissioner of police of Pune Amitabh Gupta on Tuesday said a new traffic police office would be opened soon in rural Pune to address the complaints related to congestion on the highways connecting Ahmednagar and Solapur. Gupta’s statement came in the wake of the state government merging the Lonikand and Loni Kalbhor police stations in the Pune police commissionerate on Monday midnight. The Pune commissioner of police (CP) told TOI, “We shall be opening a new crime branch and special branch offices in two months’ time. We shall also launch four beat systems each to intensify patrolling in the 44 villages coming under the two police stations.” He said, “We shall provide additional manpower and offer the services to residents on a par with that in Pune. The police stations will become fully functional on a par with those in Pune.” After the merger, the total number of police stations in the Pune police commissionerate has increased to 32 from the existing 30. Plans are afoot to start seven new police stations in the city. The Lonikand police station would be assigned to assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Yerawada division, under the deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Zone IV. The Loni Kalbhor police station would be assigned to ACP, Hadapsar division, under the DCP, Zone V. Additional commissioner of police (administration) Jalindar Supekar said, “We are assessing the crime rate, law and order situation and the manpower required at the police stations. We shall be providing wireless communication, walkie talkie sets, vehicles and other facilities to policemen.” DCP (Zone IV) Pankaj Deshmukh said, “Wagholi, linking Kharadi, is one of the most important suburbs under the Lonikand police because it has witnessed rapid urbanisation. We shall be providing a lot of resources for improving services to people residing in 23 villages there. We are planning to start four to five police outposts for catering to the growing needs of people.” DCP (Zone V) Namrata Patil said, “The 21 villages, including Uruli Kanchan coming under the Loni Kalbhor police, was merged in the jurisdiction of the Pune police. Plans are on the cards to de-merge Uruli Kanchan because it is a hardcore rural area in the due course of time.” She said, “Loni Kalbhor, linking Hadapsar, is known for rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, increase in population and rise in crime. We have two police outposts and we plan to reduce the response time of police to help people in distress.” Graphics HL: FRESH EQUATIONS The Lonikand police station, spread over 241.69sqkm, was carved out from the Loni Kalbhor police, earlier under the Pune rural police The jurisdiction of Loni Kalbhor police, now under the Pune police commissionerate, was spread over 347sqkm The merger of Lonikand and Loni Kalbhor police stations has increased the jurisdiction of the Pune police from the existing 529sqkm to 1,017.69sqkm KEY NUMBERS Police station Number Lonikand 9527069100 Loni Kalbhor 020-26913260||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-traffic-police-office-soon-to-curb-congestion-on-ahmednagar-solapur-highways-pune-cp/articleshow/81657828.cms||Asseem Shaikh

At present, 55 of the 75 flu clinics are functioning. The flu clinics would identify people requiring Covid-19 tests after preliminary check-ups. TimesViewThe flu clinics can serve as sentinel sites during the Covid-19 pandemic. A report on Covid-19 containment, which was compiled with inputs from the Central team of experts, had said Pune needed more flu clinics to improve its Covid-19 surveillance and control the further spread of the virus. Local authorities can team up with doctors in the region to increase the number of such clinics, so that people with Covid-19 symptoms are immediately identified and given access to coronavirus testing and careReopening of all the clinics came up at at a meeting between representatives of private hospitals and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Monday. “More flu clinics should be operated to ensure primary screening of people. This will lead to better detection and proper management of the Covid-19 patients,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India’s Pune chapter. Maithili Kavathekar, director of Sahyadri Speciality Labs (laboratory services), said, “Not even the mildest flu-like symptoms should be ignored. It can be a sign of Covid-19 infection. Any negligence by Covid-19 patients may lead to further spread of the virus.” Senior PMC official Sanjeev Wavare said, “The 55 operational flu clinics are adequate for the current demand. The number will be increased to 75 if there’s a need.”  The daily Covid-19 cases hit a fresh peak in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) on Tuesday, with 5,722 people testing positive for the contagion in the past 24 hours, despite the total number of tests dropping below 20,000 to 19,796 for the first time in the last six days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/health-hubs-want-all-flu-clinics-to-restart/articleshow/81657814.cms||---

SWR-Hubbali had sought the transfer of 17,138 sqm of land in Dharbandora, Sanguem and Salcete talukas for the doubling of the Kulem-Margao stretch. The South Goa collector processed the request, and the land will be transferred on payment of Rs 1.6 crore. Over the past several months, the state has been witnessing agitations over the project. The total length of double tracking is around 70km. A senior official said that the total private area needed for the project is 12 hectares, of which 4.5 hectares has been acquired already. While SWR is continuing their work, people of several affected areas have been stopping officials. A few months ago, Goa witnessed a massive agitation in which locals sat on the railway track to oppose the project. The apprehension of the people of Goa is that the double-tracking is being done to facilitate the transportation of coal to neighbouring Karnataka. People have said that coal transportation is causing pollution and that they’re suffering from respiratory ailments as a result. However, after winning both the zilla panchayat seats, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that he would go ahead with all three linear projects — double-tracking, widening of the national highway, and the Tamnar transmission line. Sawant also assured Union home minister Amit Shah of removing hurdles in the way of completing these projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabinet-nod-to-transfer-of-17k-sqm-for-double-tracking/articleshow/81658792.cms||---

The cantonment wants to add a hospital with a capacity of 200 beds with oxygen support at its newly constructed building to treat Covid-19 patients. The number of Covid-19 patients has been on the rise over the last ten days. “We have sought Rs 90 lakh under the state disaster relief fund from the district administration, but we are yet to get any response from them. Dues worth Rs 1 crore are pending with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for treating their Covid-19 patients last year. If we get these funds, we will be able to add the beds at the new building on the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Cantonment General hospital campus,” said Amit Kumar, chief executive officer of PCB. The number of active cases in the cantonment limits has increased to 165 in the last two weeks. Around 100 positive patients are currently under home isolation in the PCB limits. “The situation is very grim. We need to have more oxygen-supported beds to provide timely treatment to patients getting admitted to the hospital daily,” Kumar said. “At present, we only have 40 beds at our general hospital, which is inadequate in the current situation,” said Dr VD Gaikwad, resident medical officer at the PCB. Kumar said coronavirus cases are being reported from across the cantonment. “In the past, we had maximum positive cases from slum pockets, but that is not the case now. As a result, we can’t even demarcate containment zones,” he said. A senior official said that the cantonment did not have any means to monitor patients under home isolation. “These people may mingle with the local residents posing a danger to others.

Immovable and movable properties owned by PJ Mathew (proprietor of Mathew International that recruited nurses to Kuwait charging exorbitant service fees) and his relatives Celine Mathew and Thomas Mathew were attached. The attached properties include a duplex apartment and a piece of land in the name of Celine in Mumbai, two cents in the name of Thomas in Ambalappuzha, a luxury car owned by Mathew and Rs 4.55 crore, which were seized by the income tax department in a raid held at Mathew International offices in 2015. “During the course of the investigation it was revealed that Mathew, with the help of others, recruited over 900 nurses who were to be employed in Kuwait by charging an exorbitant service charge, ranging from Rs 18.5-Rs 20 lakh from each applicant. This service charge was in excess to the stipulated amount of Rs 20,000. The investigation revealed that Mathew International illegally collected around Rs 205. 7 crore from the emigrants,” said ED’s statement. ED has initiated investigations under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) based on the case registered by CBI in 2015 against a few private overseas employment agencies that allegedly recruited nurses to Kuwait charging around Rs 20 lakh each when the rule said not to charge above Rs 20,000. L Adolphus, Protector of Emigrants, Kochi, Mohammed Naina Prabhu, proprietor of Munavvara Associates, Mumbai were also accused in multiple cases registered by CBI. Based on the CBI chargesheet, ED had registered a case under PMLA in 2018. ED said illegally-collected money was sent to Kuwait through hawala channels with the help of Ideal Forex owned by Mohammad Aslam at Penta Menaka shopping complex in Kochi. In a raid here in 2015, ED seized Rs 6.4 lakh besides currencies of 19 countries worth Rs 24.9 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hiring-firms-assets-worth-rs-7-5cr-attached/articleshow/81657842.cms||---

The government claims to have given four-wheelers and two-wheelers to cops and installed CC cameras at various places but the murder reflects the poor law and order situation in the state, he alleged. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/has-crime-rate-come-down-cong/articleshow/81657829.cms||---

Malik said the state home department had verified the report and there was no truth in it. Malik alleged that Shukla had indulged in illegal phone tapping. “She had no authority to tap phones of officers or politicians. In fact, it has been alleged that she tapped phones of politicians in the new government too. She was doing all these things illegally and without permission. She was working for the BJP. Therefore, she was given a side posting,” he claimed. On her report, Malik said, “Shukla submitted a list of officers who were looking for a choice posting, but less than five per cent of them were shifted (at that time). In routine course too, they were due for transfer, so there is no question of corruption or malpractices in these changes.” Malik reiterated NCP’s position that home minister Anil Deshmukh was in quarantine during the period he was alleged to have met Sachin Waze and other cops to discuss “collection” of money. “Fadnavis’s homework is poor. Before making statements, he did not check facts from his sources,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shukla-worked-for-bjp-theres-no-truth-in-her-report/articleshow/81658804.cms||---

The minister, however, added that Bihar does not need a port at Paradip in Odisha. The state government has been pursuing the matter with the Odisha government. Mandviya said the riverine port in Bihar will suffice the need of movement of cargo for import-export purpose. “Your government wants to have a port at Paradip. You do not need to construct a port at Paradip. A riverine port will be constructed in your state itself, which will facilitate the movement of cargo from Bihar. You will be directly connected to sea through waterways and you will be able to do exim (export-import) cargo movement,” Mandviya told Saran MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy in reply to his starred question in the Lok Sabha on March 18. The minister said a cargo terminal is also proposed to be developed at Kalu Ghat in Saran district. Incidentally, a team of senior officials from Bihar government had held a meeting with Odisha government officials at Bhubaneshwar on March 2 on the proposal to set up a port facility on Odisha coast. As per a statement issued by Rudy, he said in the Lok Sabha that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) constructed the Chhapra-Muzaffarpur highway. Rudy said the inland waterways-37 has been declared, which will start from Sonepur up to Kathmandu. Mandviya assured Rudy about the movement of big vessels on the said waterways. He said a draft of 2.5 metres is available at Kalu Ghat, which will be sufficient for the movement of middle-sized vessels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/min-port-to-be-built-on-gandak-bank-in-saran/articleshow/81658799.cms||Piyush Tripathi

Chief minister Pramod Sawant told reporters that the iconic cultural complex would not be demolished and that renovation would be undertaken without interfering with its basic structure. “The Kala Academy is deteriorating day by day due to salt water. If we’d have opted to construct an entirely new building, we would have had to obtain various permissions, including those pertaining to the Coastal Regulation Zone. There are other issues too,” he said after the cabinet meeting. Work on the building — which lies on the bank of the Mandovi river — will involve structural repair and allied civil works, plumbing and drainage systems, electric works, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC), and acoustic works, among other interventions, the cabinet note stated. As these pertain to structural retrofitting of the Kala Academy, the PWD will be instructed to execute the project through specialised agencies or experts as per each job’s scope and according to the estimates prepared by the department. The Kala Academy will look like a new structure after renovation is complete, art and culture minister Govind Gaude said, and added that the foundation stone for the project may be laid on April 1. On July 24, 2019, TOI had reported that the Charles Correa-designed masterpiece was likely to see its popular open-air auditorium demolished. After a series of reports published by TOI stating the government’s plans towards this end, the high court had taken suo motu cognisance and had sought a response from the state. Gaude had subsequently changed tack and had said that the structure would be strengthened. The Charles Correa Foundation had also reacted strongly to these developments, stating that it had not been consulted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rs-50-crore-ka-renovation-project-gets-cabinet-nod/articleshow/81657841.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chennai||‘Lotus will bloom soon in the Union territory’||Union minister of state for parliamentary affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal vowed that lotus will bloom in the Union territory of Puducherry. In an interview with Bosco Dominique he said ‘high command policy’ followed by the Congress will no longer work in Puducherry and the people will decide who will be their next chief minister. Your comment on charges that the BJP always pulls members of the opposition parties into it. It is not correct. The leaders and cadres from other parties willingly joined the BJP as they wanted to be a part of a fast-growing party. They believe that the country will prosper under the BJP-led NDA. We have never forced anyone to join the party. Your take on charges that the BJP used the LG’s office and nominated MLAs to topple the Congress government. Former chief minister V Narayanasamy could not deliver. That is why the MLAs of his own party were not happy with the government. In the 2016 assembly polls, former minister A Namassivayam, who was also PPCC president, was the chief ministerial candidate of the Congress. He was supposed to become the CM. But why did Narayanasamy became CM? This high command policy will not work here. Now people will decide who will be their next chief minister. Narayanasamy dared Union home minister Amit Shah to prove his `15,000 crore misappropriation charges against him. Your comments. Whatever Amit Shah had said is true. The Union government provided Rs15,000 crore for Puducherry. But the Congress government could not deliver. The government managed the funds badly. For example, the government was reluctant to execute Centre-sponsored scheme PMAY. Tamil Nadu executed the scheme well. Narayanasamy feared that the central schemes, if executed effectively, would make Prime Minister Narendra Modi popular. Hence, he did not show any interest in executing those schemes. Your ally AINRC has fielded independent candidates against the BJP and the AIADMK in a few constituencies? Your take. That is true. But we were told that they will withdraw. AINRC founder-president N Rangasamy also clarified that he went to a temple where one of the independent candidates met him and out of courtesy, he blessed him. Do you think the party’s ‘one nation one language’ policy will benefit the party in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry? We are committed to promote all Indian languages, including Tamil. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that he regretted not learning Tamil. He recited quotes from Thirukkural and Tamil poet Bharathiar. It shows his respect for Tamil. Tamil is one of the oldest languages, and a classical language. Do you regret that the BJP could not lead NDA in Puducherry? We are happy with the seat sharing arrangements. BJP will win all the nine seats and enter the assembly and NDA will form the government. That is far more important. What is the reason for the sudden recall of former lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi? It is past now. Why do you want to dwell in the past?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/lotus-will-bloom-soon-in-the-union-territory/articleshow/81657840.cms||Bosco Dominique
---||Kozhikode||Kerala assembly polls 2021: Naseer ‘hopeful’ of getting support from BJP||KOZHIKODE: Uncertainty continued for BJP workers at Thalassery after the nomination papers of its party candidate were rejected by the Returning Officer after scrutiny. The party doesn't have much options and a shift in the vote base (over 20,000 votes) to either LDF or the UDF could cause a very serious political crisis for the party. At Thalassery constituency, a total of six candidates are now in the fray. Five nominations, including that of the BJP candidate were rejected and one candidate withdrew his nomination. Out of the six candidates, two are namesakes and two are from the other two fronts. Another candidate, Shamseer Ibrahim, whose name is similar to the LDF candidate AN Shamseer, is from the Welfare Party of India. Former CPM rebel candidate COT Naseer who is contesting under the banner of Indian Gandhian party is the other candidate. Naseer said that though BJP leaders have not approached him directly to offer support he is hopeful of getting their votes since they have been left with no other option. “I am standing as a candidate against the politics of violence. I consider every vote I receive as a vote for that cause. Though the BJP leaders have not approached me, I have come across several screenshots from “so-called BJP WhatsApp groups” where discussions are being held on voting for me. I am hopeful about the development and welcome votes from any corner,” Naseer said. Naseer, a former CPM rebel had contested as an independent candidate from Vatakara Lok Sabha constituency in the last elections and came under an attack by a group of people soon after. Meanwhile, the CPM candidate is confident about a victory as the party secured over 53% vote share in the last assembly elections. As per the 2016 results, Congress and BJP together have only 44% vote share here. In 2016, Shamseer had won by a margin of 34,117 votes. The left candidate had secured a total 70,741 votes while the Congress and the BJP candidates won 36,624 and 22,125 votes, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/thalassery-naseer-hopeful-of-bjp-support/articleshow/81657839.cms||---

Fearing that he might be caught after police began an investigation, the thief left Rs 1 lakh in front of the house of the farmer, Guguloth Lachcharam. The farmer had complained to police that Rs 1.7 lakh was stolen from his house on March 17. Police took up investigation of the case after the farmer lodged a complaint and on March 20, a dog squad and Clues Team went to the place of crime. Perhaps, the activity was noticed by the thief, who felt that the dog squad would trace him out. Lachcharam was pleasently surprised to notice Rs 1 lakh cash was left in front of his house on March 21. The thief had not left the entire money. The farmer had another surprise in store for him the following day, March 22. The thief left Rs 70,000 once again in front of the farmer’s house.

---||Hyderabad||‘Yoga showed me the path to mental, spiritual wellness’||By: Ashutosh TopeyIt’s been over a year since the world started grappling with a global pandemic. When it first set it, it brought a flurry of emotions to me personally. It started with a sense of fear of the unknown with constant stress and anxiety. It gradually turned into feelings of resentment, blame and frustration. Months of being holed up without any social connect pushed me into a negative spiral and I could see my life falling apart. It was at this point that I decided to pick up the pieces and start building my life all over again. I turned to yoga, which has literally redefined who I am and what I stand for. I joined a yoga teacher training programme being offered by a reputed academy, and it had a profound impact on my life. To begin with, regular practice of meditation, ‘Yog Nidra’, and relaxation techniques helped me to calm down my restless mind by leading to better mental wellness. Secondly, it turned out to be a great way to improve physical endurance. ‘Asanas’ helped to strengthen my body and improved flexibility for physical wellness. Next, following the principles of ‘Yama’ and ‘Niyama’, worked wonders in improving my interpersonal relationships with others and, thereby, enhanced my social wellness. And lastly, yoga helped my soul. It ultimately allowed me to connect with my inner-self and guided me to find a true purpose and meaning in life – taking me on the liberating path of spiritual wellness. Following the programme, I finally got my international yoga teacher certification that gave me confidence to launch my own online virtual yoga studio with a mission is to radiate the knowledge of yoga for a holistic 360 degrees wellness. I created my website and started building my online credibility by posting yoga-related messages and videos on social media. Fortunately, I got students enrolling for my classes right from the first month. It makes my day when a student calls me and tells how yoga is helping him/her overcome a long troubling health issue. That is when I feel that I am able to make a positive difference, however small it may be, in others’ lives by teaching yoga and leading them on their path towards health and happiness.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Overconfidence of coalitions in Kerala||By - T P Sreenivasan On the eve of the elections in Kerala, one feature that characterizes all political leaders is overconfidence. It is common practice for politicians down the ages to express optimism about victory even when they know that they are down in the doldrums. But here, the overconfidence makes them say and do things without being aware of the dangers lurking around them. Kerala has a healthy tradition of bringing the two coalitions to power by turns so that each can spend half their term to undo what its predecessor had done and the other half to make their own mistakes. This disproves the theory that Kerala is a politically polarized state. There is obviously a swing group which remembers the evils of the previous government and votes for a change in the fond hope that the other side may deliver better. Consequently, the progress of the state is stalled. This time, the incumbent LDF government is confident that it will continue despite a battalion of scandals, corruption charges, allegations of anti-national activities in collusion with a foreign country and mishandling of sensitive issues, which should normally have brought the government down even before it completed its term. The campaign slogan of the coalition is that “return is certain.” Not only that, the latest opinion polls by different agencies and TV channels indicate that continuity is possible. Unsurprisingly, the ruling coalition bristles with overconfidence. The main opposition coalition, UDF, of which Congress is the leading partner is no less confident, as it believes that it is the only viable alternative for Kerala, even though not a day passes without defiance of the state and central leaderships on the selection of candidates. The release of the list of candidates in the name of the High Command culminated in a tonsure by a spirited lady leader. The coalition is expecting to return to power on the strength of the number of cases raised by it to discredit the ruling coalition. Muslim League, a component of UDF, has quietly planned things in advance, expanded the number of seats and announced its candidates. Normally, announcements by the supreme head of the party is never challenged by the party, but this time the candidate selection was questioned by some. The overconfidence of NDA is a true mystery as a wave in its favour is not in evidence. Metroman E Sreedharan has much to be confident about and he naturally expresses that confidence in modest terms. One swallow does not make a summer. He should have brought in some like-minded and capable people into the fray. The reality does not match the aspirations as of now. Hope the Metroman, with his outstanding credentials, will be in the Rashtrapati Bhavan a la Dr APJ Abdul Kalam one day. The confidence of parties has engendered a phenomenon this time, which can be characterized as “localitis”. The political parties have always been suspicious of “imported” candidates as they have their own hierarchy based on working at the grass roots levels. The recent experience of fortune seekers entering politics at high levels has led to extreme caution. This time the “localitis” became so acute that some good people became victims of this prejudice. The tragic flaw of overconfidence makes any prediction difficult and pollsters are waiting for the completion of the flow of “prominent” people from one coalition to another even at the last minute, believing that even a week is a long time in politics. The only prediction that can be made at this time is that there will be many surprises when the voting machines deliver the results. (The writer is a former Ambassador of India, living in Kerala since 2004)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/overconfidence-of-coalitions-in-kerala/articleshow/81620595.cms||---

VACB found that KM Shaji earned approximately Rs 88.5 lakh from known and legal sources during the period and his expenditure stood at Rs 32.1 lakh. Also it was found that he had acquired assets worth Rs 2.03 crore. “The total assets and expenditure together would come to Rs 2.3 crore, which is not commensurate with his income from known and legal sources, and (he is) found (to have) amassed wealth to the tune of Rs 1.4 crore, which is disproportionate to his known legal source of income by a margin of 166%,” said the report. The report prepared by superintendent S Sasidharan (VACB), has recommended that a vigilance case may be registered against Shaji, under section 13(2) read with 13(1) (e) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The report said that a detailed investigation is needed to unearth the exact volume of his disproportionate assets. VACB special cell had questioned the complainant, Shaji and 25 other witnesses. Meanwhile Shaji, contesting as UDF candidate in Azhikode, said the enquiry was politically motivated and meant to trap him. “I have sources of income to show for whatever properties I have. I had given proof to ED when they asked me and am ready to hand it over to those who want to look into it. But, this inquiry is not sincere... They have done a serious wrong by submitting the report in a sealed cover and leaking it just before elections...,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/vacb-recommends-case-against-shaji/articleshow/81657856.cms||---

In the letter, former minister and Congress functionary Rai sought security cover claiming life threat from Ansari. He also mentioned that he had earlier written to chief minister Yogi Adityanath on February 6, explaining that he was appearing before MP MLA court in Prayagraj as a witness against Ansari in his brother Awadhesh Rai’s murder case but his security cover had been withdrawn and arms licences also cancelled. “The CM did not take note of my letter while the security personnel given to me on bearing 10% prescribed expenses was also withdrawn,” said Rai. Rai asked, “If the government is interested in ensuring punishment for Ansari, why did it put my life at stake by withdrawing my security cover despite knowing that my evidence will ensure capital punishment for him?” The Congress functionary had opened a front against BJP on the issue of Ansari in October 2020 after its MLA and Krishnanand Rai’s widow Alka Rai started writing letters to Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra accusing that the Congress-led Punjab government was shielding Ansari. Rai’s brother was shot dead outside his residence in 1991. Rai is a complainant and prime witness against Ansari and other accused persons in the case, although he had enjoyed the support of Ansari’s Qaumi Ekta Dal in the 2014 parliamentary election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/up-cong-ex-mla-writes-to-guv-seeks-security-citing-threat-from-mukhtar-ansari/articleshow/81657849.cms||---
---||Dehradun||After 3 years of struggle, women of Bageshwar village make their area liquor-free||PITHORAGARH: After struggling for three years, women of Jaitoli village in Bageshwar district have managed to make their area liquor-free. The result was a combined effort of the women and youths of the village. Jaitoli is a remote village in Kapkot tehsil of Bageshwar with a population of 130 and is the last village on the Kapkot-Sundardhunga trek. Every year, thousands of tourists and adventure enthusiasts visit Jaitoli while on their way to Sundardhunga. Gram pradhan Malti Devi told TOI, “The men in the village work as guides, but they also started selling liquor to tourists to earn some extra bucks. Later, they, too, started consuming liquor which became a cause of domestic violence in the village.” The NGO Hans Foundation adopted Khati village, 7km away from Jaitoli, and started social work in the village. They also helped inspire women and raise their voice against liquor consumption, Malti Devi added. “In 2017, two self-help groups constituted by women — Jai Nanda and Jai Jivadanu — decided to make the village liquor-free before it could spoil its youths,” said Basanti Devi, Jai Nanda’s chairperson. It was decided that a fine of Rs 10,000 will be imposed for selling liquor, Rs 5,000 on consuming it and Rs 500 if a person is in possession of even an empty liquor bottle, she added. Kalavati, a resident of Jaitoli, said, “In the beginning, people refused to cooperate, but fear of social alienation helped every man in the community to quit liquor. If we had not imposed fines, this would have never happened. We even collected Rs 43,000 as fine.” “We want to use this money for self-employment of women of the village and use Ringal (Himalayan bamboo) for craft production for the tourists and adventurers that visit our village,” said Lilawati, another resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-3-years-of-struggle-women-of-bageshwar-village-make-their-area-liquor-free/articleshow/81656899.cms||Prem Punetha
---||Hyderabad||Voters scribble abusive comments on ballot paper||HYDERABAD: Graduate voters were abusive, used vulgar and filthy language, and wrote lewd comments on ballot papers in Khammam-Warangal- Nalgonda graduates’ constituency MLC poll held recently. As many as 21,636 votes of 3,87,969 votes were invalid in the constituency, but it turns out it was not just because the graduates did not know how to vote. Voters are not supposed to write anything on the ballot paper, but they scribbled the choicest abuses.  In the Hyderabad-Mahbubnagar-Rangareddy graduates’ constituency, 21,309 voters were invalid of 3,58,348 votes polled. According to sources, a voter wrote a comment praising a woman candidates looks. Sexist comments were made against the candidate by another voter, who wrote: “You should just apply make-up and sit at home. Why do you need to be politics? (sic).” Voters did not like some candidates being in the fray. “You are in contest only to divide votes. So I’m giving you my last preference vote,” a voter wrote, against the name of the candidate. The number of invalid votes for both the MLC seats came as a surprise. However, mistakes apart, either due to lack of knowledge or negligence, some graduate voters in Khammam-Warangal-Nalgonda MLC constituency chose the ballot paper to be abusive towards candidates. Their ballot papers too were invalid as nothing is supposed to be written on the ballot paper. S Vani Devi, TRS candidate who won from the Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar seat, was upset with the number of invalid votes. “Is this what you learnt? With all the education you had, you could not even cast valid votes,” she said on the final day of counting looking at the number of invalid votes polled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/voters-scribble-abusive-comments-on-ballot-paper/articleshow/81657847.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Chennai||‘Prove allegations or apologise openly’||Former Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy dared Union home minister Amit Shah to order a probe to prove the `15,000 crore misappropriation charge against him or else tender an open apology. In an interview with Bosco Dominique, Narayanasamy dismissed the rival parties’ claim that the Congress base has started eroding in Puducherry. Excerpts:  Many Congress leaders have defected to the rival camp recently. How do you plan to deal with it? The people who left the party were ministers and MLAs. But Congress’ grassroot workers are with us. A few people quitting will not have any impact. Minister Namassivayam, who had left the Congress and joined the BJP, is not contesting from the same constituency (Villianur). That shows that he is not sure of winning there. So, he shifted to another constituency (Mannadipet).  Is it your decision not to contest or is it the party’s call? I have taken a decision not to contest polls, although the leadership wanted me to fight the elections. Our PPCC president (A V Subramanian) is contesting the elections. Therefore, MP V Vaithilingam and I decided to work together to campaign for the party and carry out election work.  Is the Congress unhappy to concede more seats to the DMK? In an alliance, sometimes there will be friction between allies. We must overcome it. We had a hard bargain with the DMK. We had a lot of discussions with the DMK leaders. The issue was settled. But, it is unfortunate that the DMK has taken more seats. We accepted it in the interest of the alliance.  Has the PPCC failed to keep its unit together? What went wrong? Everything went well until the BJP entered the Puducherry political arena and used the power in the Centre, lieutenant governor’s office and money to dislodge our government.  Union home minister Amit Shah has accused you of misappropriating `15,000 crore fund given by the Centre to Puducherry. Your take. The Union home minister has made a baseless allegation. He must order a probe to prove his charge, or else he must tender an open apology. Corruption charges are attempts to divert the attention of the people. If the BJP takes root, it will mortgage Puducherry to the corporate houses.  How do you rate the performance of the lieutenant governor (additional charge) Tamilisai Soundararajan? And your comments on the sudden removal of Bedi? Kiran Bedi was saying that there was no file pending with her. Now lots of files have been cleared by the new lieutenant governor (Tamilisai Soundararajan). This proves that Bedi was not telling the truth. Moreover, when the model code of conduct is in force, the lieutenant governor must refrain from going for inspections and field visits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/prove-allegations-or-apologise-openly/articleshow/81657857.cms||Bosco Dominique

If one thinks that finding a namesake for a candidate with an uncommon name as C P Cheriya Mohammed, the UDF candidate in Thiruvambady, would be difficult, think again. He has a namesake opponent by the name K P Cheriya Mohammed. Not to be outdone, the LDF candidate in the constituency, Linto Joseph, also has a namesake with the same name. UDF-supported Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) candidate in Vadakara K K Rema has to face three other namesakes including one with the exact name, K K Rama along with another Rama and Rama KTK as namesake candidates. In the nearby Kuttiady constituency, which is witnessing a spirited fight between UDF’s Parakkal Abdulla and CPM’s K P Kunhammed Kutti, both the candidates have namesakes with Kunhammed Kutti having to face namesake K K Kunhammed Kutti. Same is the case of LDF independent candidate in Perinthalmanna Muhammed Musthafa, who will have the worrisome company of another Muhammed Musthafa along with two other Musthafas in the EVM voting panel. MLA in Tanur, V Abdurahiman has three other persons with the same name Abdurahiman while his opponent P K Firos of the IUML has two namesakes. UDF independent candidate Dinesh Perumanna (Dinesh Kumar) in Kunnamangalam has two namesakes in Dinesh M and Dineshan. Though the state has near 100% literacy, several top politicians in the state have fallen victim to the fake candidates. For instance, Congress leader V M Sudheeran lost to Dr K S Manoj of the CPM by a narrow margin of 1,009 votes in Alappuzha in the 2004 Lok Sabha election and the person responsible for the electoral debacle was V S Sudheeran, a CPM member, who secured 8,282 votes. The continuing proliferation of namesakes in the candidate list shows that political parties have made deploying namesakes as an essential to-do activity as part of the election management. “The practice by political parties to field namesakes shows that grabbing power has become the be-all and end-all of political parties. It is highly unfortunate for political parties to adopt such immoral tactics to defeat opponents as democracy is distinguished from other forms of government on the basis of the high moral timbre of the political actors involved,” J Prabhash, political scientist and former head of department of politics and Kerala University, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/polling-booth-tricks-namesake-spoilers-still-on-prowl/articleshow/81657858.cms||---

This is a historic moment as Kudavelli vagu (stream) is filled with Godavari water, he added. “Generally, when lakes are filled with water due to rains, the water is released into rivers. But in this case, on the request of local farmers, Kudavelli vagu is being filled with Godavari water from Kaleshwaram project,” the minister said, releasing water from Kodakandla canal on Tuesday. Harish Rao, who represents the Siddipet constituency in the assembly, released water on Tuesday morning. With this, over 7,000 acres in Gajwel and Dubbak constituencies would benefit. The water was released from Kodakandla canal, which finally reaches Kudavelli vagu. The chief minister directed water resources department officials to release water to save standing crops under the Kudavelli ayacut. The water reaches 24 checkdams under Kudavelli. The minister said that when Kudavelli gets filled (during a good monsoon), the water reaches Godavari vial Gajwel, Sircilla, Upper Manair and Mid Manair. Kudavelli vagu is at an altitude of 100 metres, while Godavari (Kaleshwaram project) is at about 600 metres. “All credit goes to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao whose vision and planning is giving results now in the form of Kaleshwaram project. Some people had opposed Mallanna Sagar reservoir as part of Kaleshwaram. Now, they should realise the benefits of the project,” Harish Rao said. “The entire region used to face severe water crisis during summer, now water bodies are full and Farmers are able to irrigate their land and we could save crops worth thousands of crores,” he added. “This was possible due to separate Telangana. The government could provide permanent solution to both irrigation and drinking water problems. The TRS government is giving reply to opposition parties’ criticism through its good governance,” Harish Rao added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/godavari-water-from-kaleshwaram-project-reaches-siddipet-stream/articleshow/81657855.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Rs 400crore project involves beautification of the space on either side of Poonamallee High Road from Ripon Buildings to Central station by providing passenger amenities, multimodal links including bus bays, and a multi-storeyed commercial complex. Southern Railway said it had not approved CMRL’s detailed proposal for renovation with landscape, pathways, canopies and seating area in front of Moore Market Complex and Central Station, which is a small part of the Central Square project, as it is coming in the way of the passenger moving area. “The renovation works proposed by CMRL above ground surface in part of Moore Market Complex and Central station will reduce the circulating area and thus cause traffic (passengers) congestion. The detailed plan/ proposal for renovation above/ on ground surface proposed by CMRL has not been approved by the competent authority of Railways,” Southern Railways said. The Railways said it permitted works construction of subways, escalators, lifts etc., below ground level as they do not obstruct the elevation of the existing Moore Market Complex and the heritage of Chennai Central.  CMRL had earlier said it has undertaken landscaping work from Raja Muthiah Road up to Central station where seating area and canopies will also be added. While the space in front of Ripon Building and Victoria Hall may be ready by August, it may take more time for the space near Central station to be ready, officials had said. Workers were also seen getting the space in front of Ripon building ready.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/landscaping-in-front-of-central-station-will-impede-passenger-traffic-movement/articleshow/81657860.cms||U Tejonmayam

---||Mumbai||Suspended cop Sachin Waze main conspirator in Mansukh Hiran murder case: ATS||MUMBAI: The anti-terrorism squad (ATS) probing the Mansukh Hiran murder case has found suspended API Sachin Waze the main conspirator and has identified four more people, including three more cops, who actively participated in the crime. At a press conference on Tuesday, ADG Jai Jeet Singh said, “The ATS has recorded Waze’s statement where he has lied that he never had the Scorpio in his custody at anytime and had no connection with its owner. We are in the process of unearthing his part in the crime.” Singh further said that the ATS has identified more people involved and they are in the process of gathering evidence against them. Singh said that Ahmedabad-based bookie Naresh Gor had procured 14 SIM cards on the behest of Waze and handed them over to arrested constable Vinayak Shinde. “Preliminary investigations also suggested that Shinde, a convicted cop in the Lakhan Bhaiya fake encounter case, has played a significant role in calling Hiran out of his Thane home and killing him. We took Shinde to various spots and recreated the scene of the crime,” said Singh. “Of the 14 SIM cards, a few of them were activated and used in the crime and some have been destroyed.” He further said: “The ATS has seized a black Volvo from Daman and is trying to find how the car was used in the crime. The forensics team is examining the Volvo to find evidence. We have also detained its owner, who is Waze’s business partner.” The accused had also destroyed some crucial CCTV footage and other evidence, said Singh. The ATS is in the process of recording the confessional statements of a few witnesses before the magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC. “Waze is in NIA custody. We will be approaching the court on March 25 with a transfer warrant issued by the Thane court for his custody,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ats-suspended-cop-main-conspirator-in-murder-case-in-mumbai/articleshow/81658815.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Kolkata||Rising Covid cases in Bengal force schools back to online mode||KOLKATA: The sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases in Bengal and the rest of the country have forced several schools to suspend on-campus lessons for classes IX and XI. Others have decided to go back to online teaching even for those senior classes when the new session resumes from mid-April. Only those set to appear for their boards might be allowed on the campus for their practicals and doubt-clearing sessions. St James’ School principal T H Ireland said, “We are discouraging classes IX and XI from attending school. The final exams are being held online. Given the spurt in Covid cases, we have decided to begin the new session for both the classes online. Only classes X and XII are allowed on campus.” He added predicting a possible rise in infection, the school had kept the online option for classes IX and XI open. “We want to ensure safety for students. The school is committed to maintaining the safety protocol. With the boards coming up, keeping classes IX and XI away will help us check any possibility of an outbreak on the campus,” Ireland added. At The Heritage School, live-streaming of classes is being held every day. There is also a provision for asynchronous teaching under which, the recordings are sent to students a day later. At the Ripon Street branch of St Augustine’s Day School, principal Richard Gasper said, “The Class-XI annual exam papers, which have a large number of examinees, were held online. The rest were held on campus. Class IX is not on the campus as they have taken their annual exams. Looking at the number of cases in April, we may keep Class IX and those students who will be promoted to classes X and XII away from the campus. They are likely to continue their online learning if the scene does not improve.” Ram Mohan Mission School principal Sujoy Biswas is yet to decide on the mode of teaching from mid-April. South Point School spokesperson Krishna Damani confirmed offline classes for IX and XI would be suspended after annual exams on Friday. “When the new session resumes in mid-April, we will take a call whether the classes will be online or not,” he said. Classes IX and XI at Julien Day Group of Schools are being taught online. “Even in the new academic session, we will decided whether to bring back the two classes on campus or not depending on Covid cases,” said Bobby Baxter, principal of Julien Day School, Ganganagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rising-covid-cases-force-schools-back-to-online-mode/articleshow/81657873.cms||Somdatta Basu

---||Goa||Young India keen to impress against strong Oman||Panaji: At 27, Sandesh Jhingan is a ‘veteran’ in this Indian football team and the central defender admits he does not really like that tag. There’s nothing he can do to shrug that. With Sunil Chhetri, 36, missing this month’s international friendlies due to Covid-19 and coach Igor Stimac handpicking several youngsters after an impressive show in the Indian Super League (ISL), the Indian squad for the clash against Oman in Dubai on Thursday will have a different look. After all, the average squad of this team is just 24. Among the dozen-odd new faces hoping for their international debut, there are two 19-year-olds. Nine of the players are attending the national camp for the first time. “There are very young players, but we won’t field all of them together and take such a risk,” Stimac told TOI during an online interaction on Wednesday. “We need to be careful, provide the minutes they need and systematically take good care. They are our future. They showed they can play good football and I hope they will become regulars with the national team.” Stimac watched these players during the ISL and was impressed. None of them, he said, had any fear of passing the ball or hesitated in decision-making. Against Oman, though, it will be a different ball game. Oman played a friendly against Jordan last week and Stimac watched how his friend and fellow Croatian Branko Ivankovic tried to tweak a few things after taking over the team in January. The 65-year-old has an impressive track record in Asia, having taken Iran to the World Cup. Even against Stimac, his record is spotless. “We played twice in Iran (league) and his team always found a way to equalise late,” said Stimac, talking of his 2015-16 stint with Sepahan SC while Ivankovic was in-charge of champions Persepolis. India have played Oman twice in the World Cup 2022 qualifiers, losing both games narrowly. The first was a 1-2 defeat after leading till the last 10 minutes in Guwahati, while the away clash saw India suffer a solitary goal defeat. Jhingan, likely to captain the team in Chhetri’s absence, knows how well India fought in both these encounters. “If you ask Oman or UAE right now, they will look at us as tough opponents. Our last two games against Oman, especially in Guwahati, we could have done better. We deserved to win,” said Jhingan. A win is not the only thing on everyone’s mind. With Oman ranked 81, 23 places above India, the pressure will be on the opponents to get a positive result, while Stimac’s target anyway is to win two of the three remaining World Cup qualifiers in June. “I expect our players to get more experience (from these two games), no more than that,” said Stimac. ”We are not obsessed with the results. What I want from our players is to have the freedom to express themselves on the field. They should feel free to do their best and not take any pressure. Getting experience is the most important thing at the moment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/young-india-keen-to-impress-against-strong-oman/articleshow/81676653.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Patna||RJD workers, cops battle it out in and outside of Bihar assembly as House adopts police bill||PATNA: Pitched battles were witnessed between RJD workers and policemen from 'sadak to sadan' (streets to legislative assembly), literally, in Patna against the controversial Bihar Special Armed Police (BSAP) Bill, 2021, which was passed amid chaos and uproarious scenes in the House later on Tuesday. The Bihar Military Police (BMP) will be renamed as BSAP. The Section 7 of the Bill empowers the BSAP to arrest anyone on suspicion without a warrant. The day began with a violent protest near Dak Bungalow crossing during the assembly march by RJD workers, who indulged in stone pelting on the policemen. They retaliated with water cannon and lathicharge. Over a dozen policemen, mediapersons and RJD workers were injured in the violence. Prior to the passage of the Bill in the state assembly, the House witnessed mounting unruly scenes and disorder right from the morning session, so much so that Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha had to requisition the district police and special auxiliary force, over and above the marshals, to bodily remove the agitating MLAs from the well to bring the House in order. In fact, they were earlier bodily whisked away from the foyer of the assembly building itself, and also beaten up. “In my entire legislative and parliamentary career, when I was an MLA in 1985, I have not seen such a scene as I saw on Tuesday,” CM Nitish Kumar said, adding that the officials concerned should have explained to the press about the nature of the Bill that evoked so much of ire, unruly behaviour and disorder. He also asked the Speaker to arrange for the training of the newly elected MLAs. Nitish also clarified in the House that its provisions will not be misused. "The Bill passed for enactment into law will not harm the people of the state. Instead, it is meant to provide protection to them," he said. But leader of the opposition in legislative assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said the Nitish Kumar government wanted to make the state police 'goonda' through the new law as they will arrest anyone on their whims. Tejashwi, when allowed to make his statement in the House, said, “There is a famous saying of Ram Manohar Lohia that if the streets become dead, the (legislature or) Parliament becomes rogue.” Patna DM and SSP had to rush with heavy police reinforcement as the situation turned out to be too problematic for the marshals to handle when the opposition members sat on a dharna outside the chamber of assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha after he adjourned the House till 4.30pm. The policemen had to drag and lift many of the opposition members to the assembly portico when they refused to leave the Speaker's chamber. The high-voltage drama continued till late evening. RJD MLA Satish Kumar Das fainted. Earlier, Tejashwi and his elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav courted arrest while leading the march from JP roundabout. After being released from the police station, Tejashwi was back in the assembly, which had reassembled at 3pm after having been adjourned thrice since morning. The moment energy minister Bijendra Yadav presented the Bill for debate, opposition members from RJD, Congress and the Left trooped into the well and tried to get physical with the treasury benches when the marshals rushed there to prevent an ugly scene. At around 5.10pm, Prem Kumar took the Speaker’s chair as presiding member, but he was hooted and shouted at by the opposition members. Building construct department minister Ashok Choudhary, along with ministers Ram Surat Rai and Jiwesh Mishra, lunged forward and pushed RJD member Chandrashekhar who fell on the ground. Prem adjourned the House. The opposition members returned to the House. while the women members among them stood around the Speaker's chair, and others along the podium, shouting slogans against the government and the CM. A few of them removed the stationery items of the Speaker and also uprooted his microphone, and someone also broke the table glass. Still others, broke the official reporters’ table. Soon, as 21 House marshals were not numerically strong, district police and auxiliary force jawans entered the well and women sections among them tried to remove the women RJD members from near the Speaker’s chair, which resulted in pulling and dragging and injury one woman member on her forehead. Soon after, several district and auxiliary force jawans arrived from the gate that led to the Speaker’s chair and bodily removed the opposition members from the well. It led to Tejashwi and Tej Pratap lunge forward scolding at the women jawans who were dragging the members. Once the well was cleared of the opposition members, the police personnel and auxiliary force jawans took vantage positions in the well, after which the Speaker took the chair to start the proceedings for the passage of the Bill.

Justice N Anand Venkatesh, who made the observation on Tuesday, then directed the CB-CID to complete the investigation in eight weeks tentatively and file a final report before the jurisdictional court concerned. “This positive action on the part of the state will bring in a lot of confidence in the investigation that is conducted by a subordinate officer. This positive stand taken by the state will also reinforce the confidence in the minds of the general public who are keenly watching the progress of the investigation in this case,” said Justice Anand Venkatesh. Pointing out that the investigating officer has recorded statements of 87 witnesses apart from the accused persons in a short span of time, Justice Anand Venkatesh said, “This court deems it fit to place on record the appreciable manner in which the investigation has taken place in this case. This court hopes that the IO will be able to complete the investigation and file a final report before the court concerned within eight weeks.” Earlier, advocate Abdul Salim, representing the DGP, submitted that an impleading petition has been filed the DGP, explaining his stand in the present case. “This court must take into consideration the stand taken by the accused person since, according to him, the entire prosecution is attended with mala fides and there is a larger conspiracy behind this case,” he added. However, noting that defence of the accused person comes into play only during trial, the judge said, “At this stage, this court cannot take into consideration the stand of the accused persons and at the best, this court can only ensure that the investigation is carried on in a free and fair manner.” The judge passed the interim order while hearing the suo motu plea initiated by the court after taking cognizance of the issue. On March 16, he had directed the Tamil Nadu government to consider taking a positive by suspending the DGP and restore public confidence that the issue had been taken up with all seriousness and the investigation would progress in a free and fair manner. The court made the observation since the DGP was not suspended even though a superintendent of police, who stopped the woman officer from proceeding further to Chennai to lodge a complaint at the instance of the DGP, was suspended.  On Tuesday, special senior counsel for the state AL Somayaji submitted that the DGP has been placed under suspension through a GO dated March 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sexual-harassment-hc-directs-cb-cid-to-end-probe-in-8-wks/articleshow/81657867.cms||---

Another video showed damaged bikes and cycles lying on the street,” the petition, filed by advocates Manish Kumar, Akaksh Vajpai, Riddhima Gaur and Archit Vasudev, stated.According to the petitioner, the woman is an adult and is free to take her decisions and her family should not harass her just because she married a man from another community.Arora submitted before the court that the houses of Dalits were attacked and casteist slurs were made by the violent mob but the cops had not invoked provisions of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act in the FIR.Police informed HC that relevant provisions of SC/ST Act had been invoked in the case and an officer of ACP-level was investigating the matter. The cops also informed the court that 10 armed police officials have been deputed outside the house of the victims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/-hc-grants-protection-asks-police-to-submit-status-report-by-april-6/articleshow/81657875.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi Police personnel to be trained in crowd control by RAF||NEW DELHI: In a first-of-its-kind exercise, Delhi Police personnel will be trained in crowd control, understanding crowd psychology and public order management at the Rapid Action Force (RAF) training academy at Meerut, Uttar Pradesh. Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava was keen on stepping up the force’s abilities in dealing with huge crowds, which often get violent and need strategic handling. A major factor has been the changing law and order scenario in and around the capital in the last two years. Police have been facing bigger and trickier challenges in terms of crowd management, prompting the police chief to think about taking sterner steps. RAF Academy of Public Order (RAPO) specialises in training not only RAF personnel, but also other paramilitary forces in things like riot control. The first batch of 75 police personnel started their training from March 22. They will finish it on April 6 after which the next batch will be dispatched. The decision to train policemen stems out of the law and order situation in the capital since December 2019. Multiple instances of violence, riots and chaotic protests have been taking place, forcing police to change their existing strategy. Earlier, protests generally involved a limited number of people, which could be tackled with ease. However, larger gatherings have been witnessed since the anti-CAA protests at multiple locations. The protest by farmers and violence on Republic Day were considered the primary reasons for the need to impart proper training to policemen, said a senior officer. The unpredictable nature of protests of late is another factor. Elaborating on the course, a senior police officer said, “This programme is a first of its kind in the history of Delhi Police in which all personnel of Delhi Armed Police will be trained in technical strategies of crowd control along with modern weapons and special techniques.” “Apart from this, the personnel will be trained in crowd psychology, public and police relations and concepts of maintaining communal harmony. They will be made familiar with various case studies to help understand things in a better manner,” added the officer. A major portion of the training will focus on the use of non- or less lethal weapons, firefighting techniques and ammunition handling. Besides, the modules will also comprise anti-riot drills and human rights awareness. The training also comprises handling of “special devices for crowd control”. However, police didn’t elaborate on this. A team led by special commissioner of police Robin Hibu and others shortlisted the personnel for the initial round of training. “This training will help police personnel handle the law and order situation properly and enable them in countering sensitive situations such as riots and protests effectively,” a senior officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-to-be-trained-in-crowd-control-by-raf/articleshow/81657892.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Chennai||Covid-19: Size, number of clusters on the rise in Chennai, say officials||CHENNAI: With 532 new cases being reported in Chennai on Tuesday, highest since November 17, health officials said the city is witnessing a spike in both the number of clusters and their size. On March 13, 15 people from four families had tested positive, while on March 17, there were 28 positive cases from eight clusters.  On Monday, officials found 40 positive cases from three branches of AGS Health Private limited and 25 cases from other clusters. Last week, nearly a dozen people from a private bank tested positive for the viral infection. “We continue to see clusters at homes after luncheons, parties, weddings and funerals. But when people take infection to their workplaces, the cluster can become huge,” said director of public health Dr TS Selvavinayagam. “When people sit in a closed environment, particularly air-conditioned rooms for long hours in close proximity, the chances of infection spreading is high. Masks and social distance can reduce the burden,” he said. The rising clusters have led to spike in average number of fresh cases reported in the city over the past few weeks. Between February 12 and 18, the city reported an average of 144 cases a day, and the following week the number rose to 152. In the week between March 12 and March 18, there were about 362 fresh cases a day. During that week, the city added 2,288 new cases and reported 17 deaths. In the last five days, the city has already surpassed last week’s total. Between March 19 and March 23, the city has reported 2,373 cases and 15 deaths. The trend reminded officials of Covid-19 cases in May last year, when teams were tracking clusters from several streets in North Chennai and the city was under a strict lockdown. On an average, the city corporation tracks down at least 30 close contacts of every positive patient. “If there is one person tested positive, we speak to family, colleagues and friends who have been in close contact with them. If clusters and cases are large, it means the health staff must track down more people and ensure they are tested,” said a senior health department official of the Greater Chennai Corporation. “We test about 30 people for every positive case. Active cases have increased in almost all zones,” he said. On Tuesday, zonal health officials have asked commercial establishments and factories to do thermal scanning for all staff. Those showing symptoms of viral infection should be asked to go for a test. The company should ask their staff to always wear masks and maintain social distance. “Staff, who are eligible for vaccination, should be encouraged to take the shot. Unlike last year, we have an effective vaccine that can prevent complications and deaths. We must use it,” Dr Selva Vinayagam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/size-number-of-clusters-on-the-rise-in-city-say-officials/articleshow/81657886.cms||---

In a separate order, another bench restrained the National Commission for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe and the Tamil Nadu State Human Rights Commission from taking cognizance of the complaints given by Justice Karnan under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Justice V Bharathidasan granted the bail as Justice Karnan, his wife and son filed separate sworn affidavits expressing regret for the acts of Justice Karnan and giving an undertaking he would not repeat offences. The court restrained Justice Karanan from leaving Chennai until further orders. “It is also stated that after remanded in judicial custody, the petitioner was infected with Covid-19 virus, and has taken treatment in the hospital and now he is having post Covid-19 complications and his health condition is getting worse and he requires medical treatment,” the court said. Now the petitioner has also given an undertaking that he will not interfere with the investigation and will not tamper with the witness and if there is any violation of the undertaking given by him the bail granted to the petitioner can be cancelled without any notice, the court added. Earlier, while issuing restraint orders against National Commission for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe and the Tamil Nadu State Human Rights Commission,a bench headed by Justice M Sathyanarayanan recorded how Justice Karnan was a habitual in filing such complaints against investigating officers alleging that they abused him by using his caste name. It pointed out that such acts of Justice Karnan were frowned upon by the apex court in various orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ex-judge-karnan-gets-conditional-bail/articleshow/81657885.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||Four poachers nabbed with elephant tusk set in Uttarakhand forests||Dehradun: After five days of search operation, forest officials in Uttarakhand have found both the tusks of a dead elephant on Tuesday. The first tusk was found from four poachers on March 17, while search for another was on. On Tuesday, four more poachers were nabbed with the second tusk from Rampur road. The tusk set was taken out by the poachers in a planned manner from an adult jumbo which had died nearly a month ago due to “infighting”. The poachers were from Uttarakhand and were taking the tusks to other states, according to the search operation team members. On March 17, four poachers were nabbed with the ivory taken out from an adult elephant in Terai Central forest division. On the same day, the carcass of the elephant was found by the teams. The post-mortem report confirmed that the carcass was nearly a month old, raising fingers at the laxity of the forest department in patrolling. Frontline forest staffers were immediately removed. The poachers had either seen the dead jumbo or were informed by the forest frontline staff. They had cut out tusks from the jumbo to sell them in the international market at a promising price. The jumbo according to the forest staff died in “infighting” as per the autopsy report. The ivory is used for multiple items ranging from jewellery, utensils, showpiece, medicine to good luck charm in several countries, including India. Its trade and possession are illegal. Speaking with TOI, divisional forest officer of Terai Central, Abhilasha Singh, said, “We were scanning the forests round the clock and didn’t want the poachers to run away with the ivory. And finally we caught them with it.” When asked about the patrolling, a senior IFS officer in the department raised questions on the poor workforce at the dispense of DFOs. He told TOI, “Terai Central forest division has 150 posts sanctioned for the Forest Guard. There are just about 50 guards currently. In the given situation each guard is responsible to scan minimum 2-3 beats amid the scare of wildlife, timber mafias as well other threats.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/four-poachers-nabbed-with-elephant-tusk-set-in-uttarakhand-forests/articleshow/81656921.cms||Shivani Azad

The bill seeks to make it clear that the “government” in Delhi means the “Lieutenant Governor”."We have discussed with leaders of all parties and arrived at a consensus that the House will meet tomorrow (Wednesday) at 10 am ... First we will discuss the Finance Bill, NCT and other bills," Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said before the final adjournment. Joshi also informed that there would be no Zero Hour, Question Hour and Lunch Hour.The uproar in the Upper House started when Deputy Chairman Harivansh asked Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy to move a motion for the consideration of the GNCTD bill. AAP member Sanjay Singh protested against allowing the motion, saying his notice has been pending in the House.The deputy chairman assured the AAP member that his notice would be considered after the motion is moved, but Singh called it “unconstitutional".Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said that the bill is dangerous and it will grab rights of the elected government of Delhi and destroy democracy.He alleged that the government wants the LG as government and the elected dispensation as his "servant".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-to-take-up-bill-giving-more-powers-to-delhi-lg-on-wednesday/articleshow/81657900.cms||---

He added, “an important aspect that had often remained unnoticed has been the importance of academia in law schools in furtherance of legal research, improving the quality of our judgements and the input to the judges.”“I am sure the judiciary can equally utilise in some way the opportunity of interaction with these dynamic youngsters,” he said. While addressing the e-inauguration, Justice Kaul said, “to no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay the access to justice.”‘Sahyog’ aims to further the constitutional goal of access to justice by providing a platform that connects student research assistants to lawyers and organisations who have taken up pro bono cases. It was founded by Adya Jha and Dakshita Chopra, alumni of NUJS, with the hope of aiding those who are not able to bear the expenses that the dispensation of justice unfortunately demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-judge-inaugurates-web-portal-aimed-to-enhance-access-to-justice/articleshow/81657917.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Chennai||Railway Board says no stop for Tejas Exp at Tambaram, passengers disappointed||Chennai: Residents demanding a stop at Tambaram railway station for the Chennai-Madurai Tejas Express are disappointed as the the Railway Board, according to an RTI reply, has not approved the proposal. The train which originates at Egmore, with annual footfalls of 4.5 crore, will, however, stop at Dindigul. Tambaram records footfalls of nearly 7 crore annually, next only to Chennai Beach station, with footfalls of 9.5 crore every year, on the city’s suburban station network. Southern Railway, in a series of RTI replies, said that in June 2019 the chief passenger transport manager wrote to M S Bhatia, Railway Board executive director (coaching), saying the member (traffic) of the Railway Board had during a visit to the city suggested a halt for the train at Tambaram. The Southern Railway general manager then submitted a recommendation, saying there would be an increase of only 5 minutes in the onward journey, but there would be no delay in the overall running time. But as per an RTI reply dated March 18, 2021, from M S Bhatia, the railways’ apex body did not approve it. “It only approved the stoppage at Dindigul but not at Tambaram,” said Dayanand Krishnan, a resident of Chitlapakkam. “I sent many RTI applications, seeking information on the recommendations and whether meetings were held to discuss the issue. They replied that no meetings were held. We have no idea why the stoppage was not approved. ” Several residents have been demanding the halt for more than a year since the service began. Varathan Ananthappan, a resident of Madipakkam said, “There is huge patronage for this train. Now, we need to book cabs that cost us Rs 1,000 more than the ticket fare. In New Delhi, the Tejas Express stops at Ghaziabad, just 13km away, and in Mumbai, it stops at Thane, 35km away. Then why not here?” A Southern Railway said the reason for the Railway Board not approving the proposal could not be ascertained. Another official said the issue would be taken up again after the state assembly election process was over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/railway-board-says-no-stop-for-tejas-exp-at-tambaram-passengers-disappointed/articleshow/81657894.cms||---
---||Delhi||Doctor’s suicide case: Court grants bail to co-accused||New Delhi: A special court on Tuesday granted bail to Kapil Nagar, a co-accused in the case of an alleged suicide by a doctor, which also involved Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Deoli Prakash Jarwal. While noting that Nagar had spent 42 days in custody, special judge Geetanji Goel said, “The chargesheet has already been filed. In these circumstances, no purpose would be served by sending the applicant to custody.” It is alleged that the deceased was threatened and intimidated for extortion by the accused, Jarwal and Nagar. The deceased, a doctor, was also running a business of water tanker in collaboration with Delhi Jal Board since 2005, the FIR stated. Police alleged that the accused extorted the deceased on a monthly-basis through Nagar and other people, and when the doctor refused to give money, the accused allegedly threatened him to get the tankers removed from Delhi Jal Board and also used his influence to stop payments of the pending bills. The doctor allegedly died by suicide in Durga Vihar in south Delhi and left a note holding Jarwal responsible for his death. Nagar’s counsel argued that the authenticity of the suicide note was a matter of investigation and added that allegations against him were a part of a well-crafted conspiracy. The state’s prosecutor opposed Nagar’s bail plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/doctors-suicide-case-court-grants-bail-to-co-accused/articleshow/81657904.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||This Time, Last Year: Lessons From Blue Skies||New Delhi: A year ago, the so-called janata curfew on March 22 heralded the shutdown of the nation from March 24 to counter Covid-19’s spread. Vehicles went off the roads, industrial units ground to a halt and construction activity ceased. While the economy took a hit, the air over Delhi reached quality highs. By March 28, the air was in the ‘good’ category with the Air Quality Index at just 45. The city went on to record five such ‘good’ air days in the year, the most since the Central Pollution Control Board launched the AQI readings in 2015. By the first week of April, the capital had azure skies, birdsong was audible everywhere and the Yamuna was visibly cleaner.A year on, all environmental gains of the lockdown have been lost. Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory, however, does not write off the positives. He explained, “With next to no emissions during the lockdown, we were able to analyse how significant a role dust pollution played in air quality and what effect reduction in vehicular and industrial pollution could have.”Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research & advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said the lockdown showed that reduction in pollutants was possible, but all regions had to clean up their acts and at speed across critical sectors such as vehicles, industries, power plants, waste, construction & open-air burning. “The bouncing back of pollution proves the change can be sustained only with systemic and time-bound action,” she said. “We have to raise the level of ambition to drive compliance with stricter air quality targets.”There are eight key sources of pollution according to source apportionment studies: thermal power plants, vehicles, industries, households, brick kilns, open burning, diesel generator sets and dust. Dr Sagnik Dey, associate professor, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT-Delhi, pointed out that during the lockdown, only four of these were eliminated, namely vehicles, industries, brick kilns and construction dust.“The power plants were still functioning. Household pollution might, in fact, have slightly increased because people were confined indoors. DG sets and open burning were also prevalent,” said Dey. “So clearly, this reduction in pollution during the lockdown came from the remaining four sources. This needs to be taken into account in the National Clean Air Programme. If we can control vehicular, industrial, brick-kiln and construction pollution, we can attain our PM2.5 and PM10 targets.”CPCB data confirmed the improvement of air during that period. The AQI in March 2020 was 128 (moderate) compared with 184 (moderate) in 2019. The average AQI dropped to 110 (moderate) in April against 211 (poor) in 2019, while the average AQI of 144 (moderate) in May was much less than the 221 of a year earlier. August was the cleanest month of the year, recording four ‘good’ air days and an average AQI of 64 (satisfactory).However, by November, things were returning to ‘normal’. Stubble burning from October on and a late Diwali saw 2020 record a more polluted November than in 2019, while the average AQI in December rose to 332 (very poor).As for the Yamuna, CPCB attributed its temporary improvement to an increase in the flow of water, aided by the closure of industrial units. CPCB tested samples from Palla, Nizamuddin and Okhla, while DPCC from nine locations. The major findings were that the water quality at the three stations had improved significantly against the pre-lockdown quality, with the biological oxygen demand at Nizamuddin and Okhla going up by as much as 90% and similar increases in the chemical oxygen demand. DPCC found BOD levels rising by up to 33%.A DPCC official, however, said, “Industrial effluent is only a small portion of the pollution. Household sewage continues to flow into the river and until that is halted, we cannot see a blue Yamuna again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/this-time-last-year-lessons-from-blue-skies/articleshow/81657972.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt had rejected DGP’s suggestions on transfers||MUMBAI: Soon after intelligence commissioner Rashmi Shukla had in August 2020 submitted her report on transfers in the home department in violation of rules, TOI was the first to report on her “secret” communication. Shukla had on August 25 alerted the then DGP Subodh Jaiswal on the network of politically connected brokers taking bribes for transfers to prime and lucrative postings. Shukla had then placed under surveillance individuals allegedly involved in such activities. She found there was merit in the allegations that there was a racket involved. Based on the preliminary probe conducted by Shukla, Jaiswal submitted a comprehensive report to the additional chief secretary, home, with a request to identify the individuals and take action. In addition, Jaiswal had written another letter to the ACS on transfers and postings. Jaiswal’s report was brought to the notice of CM Uddhav Thackeray and home minister Anil Deshmukh, but apparently no action was taken on the grounds there was no substance in the allegations. For Jaiswal, it was a disappointing situation as the government did not accept a single suggestion made by him on postings and transfers. Jaiswal’s contention was that the government should adhere to guidelines prescribed by the apex court in the Prakash Singh case and state law on transfers, which provides for a minimum tenure of two years. Jaiswal had also submitted a list of eligible and non-eligible officers. As per Jaiswal’s contention, only 60 to 80 officers in the state were eligible for transfers. When the home department released the list of transferred officers, the DG office was shocked as several non-eligible officers were not only shifted but given prime assignments. Hurt, Jaiswal decided to go in for Central deputation and got it. “Contoversial IPS officers were granted prime assignments while many were sidelined,” a senior IPS officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-had-rejected-dgps-suggestions-on-transfers/articleshow/81658836.cms||---

The initiative is supported by the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) and Sustainable Enterprises for Water and Health(Sewah project) as an alliance between the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the SWN (Safe Water Network). USAID has partnered with the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs under the Jal Jeevan programme. The technology for the mobile water-from-air kiosk has been developed by a Hyderabad-based company under the Make in India initiative and was inaugurated on Beach Road on Tuesday. Drinking water is generated through multiple level filtration (filtering out the contaminants), cooling and condensing the air into water droplets as per the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Indian standards for potable water. Inaugurating the kiosk on Beach Road, Vizag mayor Golagani Hari Venkata Kumari said, “This idea is unique and I would like to see it replicated in tourist and slum areas.” “Apart from providing clean, mineral-enriched potable water harvested from the air, the kiosk, called Meghdoot, will also function as a water knowledge resource centre (WRKC) by creating awareness and imparting necessary information to members of the local communities as well as nearby schools and consumers on the benefits of good water, sanitation and hygiene practices,” informed Poonam Sewak, vice-president, programmes and partnerships, SWN. Ramkrishna Mukkavilli, founder and managing director of Maithri Aquatech that developed the kiosk, said, “With the endeavour to create a sustainable future and conserve scanty water resources, we have developed an innovative technology, which can generate water by harvesting the moisture in the air on a highly cost-effective and scalable basis. It is a decentralised, environment-friendly ‘plug-and-play’ solution capable of producing 100% microbe-free potable water, with a capacity of generating over one million litres of water every day.” “We are also looking forward to expanding this project across multiple locations in Visakhapatnam as well as in other smart cities in the near future,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/mobile-kiosk-in-vizag-extracts-mineral-enriched-water-from-air/articleshow/81657564.cms||Sulogna Mehta
---||Ahmedabad||Kalupur blast accused arrested from Pune||AHMEDABAD: An accused in the 2006 Kalupur railway station blast case, which left 10 people injured, was nabbed from Pune on Monday. Officers of the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad made the arrest. They said that accused Mohsin Syed, a 36-year-old resident of Syednagar in Mohammedwadi locality in Hadapsar area of Pune, was nabbed from his house 15 years after the blast took place. Cops said that Syed was also an operative of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) who had got training in Pakistan before 2006. He was also accused of hatching a conspiracy to carry out terror attacks in the country. ATS officers said that Syed had fled to his native place in Pune after the blast. He reportedly prepared to stay in to avoid being caught by the police. A team of ATS officers got input about Syed’s whereabouts through technical surveillance and human intelligence after which they nabbed him. “He was teaching at a madrassa in Pune to earn his livelihood. After getting concrete information about him, we rushed to Pune and nabbed him. The accused has been sent for corona test and will be arrested after that,” said an ATS officer. According to an ATS officer, as many as 12 accused have been arrested in the case where a blast took place at a cold drink shop on platform number-2 on February 19, 2006. As many as 11 accused are yet to be nabbed, said the officer. As per case details, a bag containing the bomb had been left inside a train. However, a sanitation worker found it and handed it over to a cop who put it in the cold drink shop, thinking that it had been misplaced by some passenger. Meanwhile, the bomb exploded, injuring 10 persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/kalupur-blast-accused-arrested-from-pune/articleshow/81657988.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||HC junks petition seeking directions to SEC on polls||Vijayawada: The high court on Tuesday dismissed a petition seeking interlocutory orders directing the state election commission to conduct ZPTC and MPTC elections. The petition, moved by Rami Reddy, alleged that state election commissioner (SEC) Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar was going on leave and intentionally postponing the elections. A single-judge bench of Justice DVSS Somayajulu heard the arguments of the SEC and state government along with those of the petitioners. Appearing for the state, the advocate general (AG) argued that even the actions of the SEC, despite his high constitutional position, were amenable to judicial review in certain circumstances. The AG pointed out that courts had directed the holding of elections in several states and that the orders of the election commission are the subject of review in many judicial decisions. Meanwhile, the counsel for SEC, N Ashwani Kumar, argued that there was no abdication of duty in this case. “Merely because SEC applied for LTC, it cannot be said that there is abdication of duty,” he said and added that discretion is vested with SEC to decide when elections should be held. After hearing arguments, the court said interim orders were not needed to conduct polls and directed the SEC and other respondents to file their counters. It posted the matter for further hearing on March 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-junks-petition-seeking-directions-to-sec-on-polls/articleshow/81657365.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Vijayawada||Communication leak: HC issues notices to 2 ministers, officials||Vijayawada: The AP high court on Tuesday issued notices to municipal minister Botcha Satyanarayana, panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy, the governor’s principal secretary, and others after hearing a writ petition filed by state election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar seeking a CBI probe into the leak of communication between him and the governor. Justice U Durgaprasada Rao heard the case. Ramesh Kumar sought directions from the high court for a CBI inquiry and submission of the interim report within 72 hours, adding that it would amount to grave injustice to him if it was not done. The SEC alleged that the principal secretary to the governor had failed to inquire into the leakage of official communication. B Adinarayana, the senior counsel representing SEC, argued that communication between two constitutional bodies is highly confidential and privileged and should not be leaked. “Two state ministers moved the AP assembly’s privilege committee, quoting the statements in the official communication between the SEC and the governor. The privileges committee has directed the SEC to give his explanation on the issue,” Adinarayana submitted to the court. One M Rami Reddy moved the high court seeking immediate notification for MPTC and ZPTC elections and cited the official communication between the SEC and the governor, he added. “There are only two ways for the leakage of the contents of the letter — one, from the office of the SEC, and the second, from the office of the governor,” Adinarayana said. The court asked SEC’s counsel if they have complained to the governor about the issue. In reply, the SEC submitted that they complained to the principal secretary to governor, for which he gave an oral reply. The court passed orders issuing notices to all defendants. CV Mohan Reddy, counsel for governor’s principal secretary, submitted to the court the writ petition is not maintainable. The court posted the matter for further hearing to March 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/communication-leak-hc-issues-notices-to-2-ministers-officials/articleshow/81657332.cms||Venu Lanka

The deceased were identified as Kotapudi Seenaiah, Gaali Seenaiah, Tuvvuru Ramanaiah, Parvatala Babu, all daily wage workers from Dalithwada in Duvvuru village. According to police, the incident took place in the early hours of Tuesday when all seven persons were heading towards Nellore city to work in a fish pond. Within ten minutes of reaching the Nellore-Mumbai national highway, a speeding minivan hit the mini-truck they were travelling in. The impact of the collision resulted in the deaths of three persons in the spot. Locals dialled 108 and rushed the injured to the Nellore Government General Hospital where one of the victims was declared dead on arrival. Police confirmed that post-mortem had been conducted on the deceased and their bodies have been handed over to their families.

The incident happened at around 1 pm inside the Tirumala temple. TTD’s chief vigilance and security officer Gopinath Jatti said that the staff manning the command control room spotted the theft through CCTV cameras and immediately alerted the security personnel present at the temple. “All three were taken into custody before they could leave the temple premises. The stolen cash was also seized from them. They were later handed over to Tirumala I town police,” said Jatti. The three-member gang’s modus operandi was to spot devotees waiting to drop currency bundles into the hundi, and get behind them in the queue. One of them would then insert his hand inside the hundi just before the devotee drops the currency bundle, grab it in a flash and then hand it over to his accomplice standing nearby. The accomplice would then quietly walk out of the temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/three-arrested-for-stealing-rs-30k-from-tirumala-hundi/articleshow/81657587.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

An Isanpur resident learnt this lesson the hard way after being allegedly cheated out of Rs 24,118 by a man who posed as a CISF jawan and put up an advertisement on a social media site seeking to sell his two-wheeler. Devanshi Shah filed a complaint against an unidentified person with Isanpur police in this regard. Shah works as a service delivery manager and stays as a paying guest in a house in Isanpur. She told police that her friend Ketan Parikh sent her a message about a Facebook post on a gearless two-wheeler for sale. He also sent her the number of the seller. “When she called the number, the man identified himself as a CISF personnel staying at the Army cantonment. He even sent a copy of his CISF identity card and liquor permit card of the military canteen. He sought Rs 3,020 as booking amount and the rest at the time of delivery. The deal was fixed for Rs 19,000,” the complaint stated. Shah claimed that she paid Rs 3,000 but later the person called her and told to make an exact payment of Rs 3,020. “He promised that Rs 3,000 will be deducted from the final payment. Later in the evening, she received another call, this time from a delivery officer who sent her photographs of the enwrapped two-wheeler. The man asked her to pay Rs 6,999. Shah again made a single payment of Rs 6,999. The person then asked her to make payment in two instalments: one of Rs 6,000 and another of Rs 999. When Shah refused to do so, the man threatened that he would not make the delivery. Shah did as asked,” the complaint stated. Again, Devanshi got a call asking her to make delivery payment of Rs 4,100. For this, she got funds from her friend after the person refused to deliver the two-wheeler if the payment is not made. Finally, when the person asked her to pay Rs 7,500 as GST charge, Devanshi lodged a complaint against the unidentified person.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cisf-jawan-cons-woman-out-of-rs-24k/articleshow/81658001.cms||---

Even as there is considerable joy at the increase in leopard population, wildlife experts are sounding a word of caution to increase the prey base and improve the surrounding habitat for the big cats. With the leopard population on an upward trajectory, there is a spill over to the different areas of the reserve, however, majority of the pockets have insufficient prey base. As per the forest record, there are only five sambar deer and 16 spotted deers and 390 blue bulls in the reserve. Hope and Beyond’s chairman Joy Gardner, who works for leopard conservation, said, “A leopard requires 4-5kg of meat every day. With the current estimated population, adult leopards will kill 20 herbivorous per week and atleast 1,000 per year. The population of herbivores is woefully short and this is forcing them to move out of park.” Experts further claimed, leopards at Jhalana are comparatively smaller in size and adult big bulls are not preferred prey. With this, the big cats have adapted to kill smaller prey, including gray langur peacock. However, peacocks number is also reducing drastically due to alleged poaching in nearby areas. An environmentalist, who wished not to be named, said, “As per the 2019 census, there were 1,758 peacocks in the reserve. But, there are very few left. It is suspected peacocks are being poached for their feathers or meat.” Space crunch in wildlife habitat is another immediate challenge faced by the forest administration. The number of leopards in Jhalana has increased to a point that the reserve can no longer sustain the big cats that currently inhabit the area. “Jhalana is spread over 20 square kilometres and the big cat population is higher than its carrying capacity. The present population of leopards at Jhalana is 32 and one male leopard requires atleast 5 sq km area. The department should not consider on developing surrounding forest areas including Galta, which is approximately 766.72 hectares in size,” said an official source. Even though there are challenges, Jhalana is a shining example of how wildlife tourism can thrive in the middle of a crowded city. The baby boom in the reserve has been the biggest tourist attraction in the country as many tourists have captured the shy big cats on camera, which is often rare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/low-prey-base-big-challenge-for-jhalana-leopard-reserve/articleshow/81657999.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As per an official order released on Tuesday, this has increased the area under VMRDA jurisdiction to 7,328 square kilometres. VMRDA officials had earlier sent proposals to the state government to include these 13 mandals in the VMRDA in October 2019. In their letter to the state government, the VMRDA officials informed that due to rapid urbanisation of Visakhapatnam city, a significant urban sprawl has been detected in the fringe areas of existing VMRDA limits towards the western corridor. “In order to reduce pressure on the urban infrastructure of the city, to ensure planned development in the fringe areas and to control the haphazard development, the said 13 mandals may be brought in to the jurisdiction of VMRDA.,” read the letter from the VMRDA to the state government. Interestingly, the VMRDA development area will be called as the executive capital as per the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill 2020. With this inclusion, other than the Integrated Tribal Development Agency area, which comprises of 11 tribal mandals, remaining parts of Visakhapatnam district have become a part of VMRDA following the merger. Visakhapatnam district consists of 43 mandals and 19 mandals are already part of VMRDA. The 13 new mandals which have come under VMRDA on Tuesday include Madugula, Ravikamatham, Butchayyapeta, Chodavaram, Devarapalli, K Kotapadu, Nathavaram, Kotauratla, Makavarapalem, Narsipatnam, Golugonda, Cheedikada and Rolugunta. These mandals are contiguous in nature and have a potential to develop as urban areas. They have witnessed decadal percentage growth of urban population from 4.10% to 8.02% in the last one decade —2001-2011. Speaking to TOI, VMRDA commissioner P Koteswara Rao said that these 13 mandals would also be included in the ongoing preparation of VMRDA master plan-2041. “We will improve basic infrastructure in these mandals at par with other VMRDA areas,” Koteswara Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vmrda-area-now-7-3k-sq-km-after-addition-of-13-mandals/articleshow/81657001.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Two tigers poached in region, toll increases to 14 in 81 days||NAGPUR: It’s raining tiger deaths in Maharashtra. With the poaching of two tigers on Tuesday, the toll since January 1, 2021 (81 days), has mounted to 14, including two cubs. With more than 50% of deaths due to poaching, experts say the state forest department needs to pull up its socks. This is the fourth tiger death in the last 10 days and the third in the last three days. On Tuesday, two tigers were found dead in separate cases in the region. A tigress (T7), around 4 years, died of suspected strangulation after a wire trap entangled her neck. The trap was perhaps laid for herbivores near Sonegaon under the Maregaon forest range in the Pandharkawda division. The carcass was found in a dry nullah around 1pm. In the second incident, the carcass of a full-grown tiger was noticed around 2pm by some women from Sarra village who had gone to the forest to collect fuelwood. The women informed the sarpanch who alerted foresters. The carcass was found in a nullah in compartment number 707 in the Warpani beat of FDCM’s Risala range. “The area adjoins the Nagalwadi range of the Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR). The carcass was highly decomposed and all the hair had fallen. The four paws of the tiger were chopped off. The tiger is fully grown and the death must have occurred at least 8-10 days ago. Due to recent rains, the carcass was damaged further,” said Rishikesh Ranjan, general manager, FDCM. Perturbed by the tiger deaths, PCCF (wildlife) Nitin Kakodkar has sounded an alert to all forest officials and instructed them to take up strict monitoring of all village peripheral areas for possible wire traps in view of the tiger death in Maregaon. In view of Holi festivities, herbivore poaching may be attempted, and hence, the PCCF has asked for special patrolling teams to be deployed. Experts and wildlife lovers have expressed shock over the series of tiger deaths in the state. “This is indeed very alarming. Tigers getting killed by poachers calls for improving the quality of protection immediately. The menace of poachers from Chhindwara district in forests around Pench has to be tackled jointly by both states. The Pandharkawda tiger snaring case is clearly the handiwork of local poachers who use snares to kill deer and wild pigs. Looking at the poaching pressure, the snares and the electric wire traps everywhere, one fears for the fate of the famous tiger ‘Walker’, not seen for some time now,” said Nitin Desai, director, Central India, Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI). “Tigers killing tigers or cubs is a natural phenomenon and indicates competition for space. This calls for long-term measures to increase space available to tigers and active population management,” added Desai. In the Umred-Karhandla-Paoni sanctuary, two eight-month-old tiger cubs were killed by the park’s dominant male Surya on March 13 and 20 respectively. These cubs of tigress Collarwali were not sired by him and he killed them to engage the tigress into mating. On March 21, a tigress was killed outside Bor. “It is a fact that gangs from neighbouring MP villages enter forest areas on our side and poach herbivores for bushmeat. On November 27, electric wires were laid inside the tourism zone of Surewani under Pench. The fact came to light after a spark. Earlier, in Pandharkawda, too, tigers with snares have died but it seems that no lessons have been learnt,” said wildlife lover Vinit Arora.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/two-tigers-poached-in-region-toll-increases-to-14-in-81-days/articleshow/81657985.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Delhi||Industries back on their feet, but crippling effect can still be felt||New Delhi: The sight of thousands of migrant labourers plodding back to their hometowns during the Covid-19 lockdown remains etched in most minds. Some weren’t lucky in their endeavour to reach home, though a majority of them made it to their villages. Many are yet to return to work in the capital even after the relaxation of the lockdown. But the missing chunk in the labour forces is only one of the current woes of Delhi’s industrial units. Demand continues to remain low despite a seeming return to normal conditions. And exacerbating industry’s struggle is an increase in the prices of raw material. “Any sector you go to, you will find that raw material prices have shot up considerably because multinational companies are trying to make a profit,” claimed Raghuvansh Arora, vice-president, Apex Chamber of Commerce and Industries. “The mentality of the trader has now become to not buy materials in advance or stockpile them unless there is demand. This means that the production in industrial areas in Delhi has gone down. The units don’t want to produce surplus goods unless they are certain they can find buyers.” Arora added that while around 80% of the labour had returned, the requirement has also been impacted. “Some of the migrant workers found jobs back home. But many others are no longer required because the factories they worked in are not producing the same quantum of products as earlier,” he explained. R K Gupta, general secretary, Mayapuri Industrial Area Welfare Association, confirmed that most of the workers who had left the city during the distressful lockdown period had returned. But, he said, demand for goods was low, leading to industries not hiring people in the numbers they did earlier. “People are not spending money like before the Covid pandemic. The demand is low, barring for luxury goods,” disclosed Gupta. “On top of this, the prices of crucial raw material like steel sheets, which are used for many things from refrigerators to cars, has increased from Rs 45-50 per kg to around Rs 70 per kg. This has impacted the product cost and in turn the already low demand for most products.” Manish Mangla, who has a stainless steel factory in Wazirpur industrial Area said that without the government giving an impetus, industries in Delhi would continue to suffer. He said that the problem right now was not labour, but production volumes. “We are only producing 60-65% of what we did earlier because the demand has come down and steel price is almost higher by one and a half times now,” Mangla said. “Our lowered production schedules mean we only require two-thirds of our original work force.” In all, therefore, labourers who did return to the capital aren’t having a good time either. Jitan Kumar, a daily-wage labourer in Naraina Industrial Area, talked of having carefully weighed his options while at home and deciding there were better work opportunities in Delhi than in Bihar. However, in the capital, he found his wages reducing by almost a quarter. “Someone earning Rs 11,000-12,000 earlier now gets Rs 8,000-9,000. After sending money home, we are left with no savings,” he added. Vipin Chandolia, a steel fabricator in Mayapuri Industrial Area, said most workers in his factory were from Bihar. “Work has certainly reduced, so not every earlier worker is now required,” Chandolia shrugged.

---||Mumbai||End 50% quota cap, states tell SC; Centre backs Maharashtra||NEW DELHI: Avoiding the risk of annoying any political constituency on the sensitive issue of reservation, state governments took almost a united stand before the Supreme Court on Tuesday in decrying 50% cap on quota. The Centre supported the Maharashtra government’s law on Maratha reservation, saying “it is valid” despite breaching the ceiling. A Constitution bench, which is to decide whether the SC’s 1992 verdict needed to be re-examined, was told by various states that the 50% cap imposed by the verdict should go and they should be allowed to decide on the quantum. “The cap is not a Lakshman Rekha that can't be crossed,” they said. SC must give states ‘free hand’ to decide quantum of quota: SibalAll the states, including Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra, that have so far filed their written submission and also argued before the apex court bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat were unanimous in their stand against the 50% cap on reservation. All the states have come out in support of Maharashtra which insisted that the Indra Sawhney verdict be re-examined by a larger bench of 11 judges to do away with the cap in view of changed socio-economic conditions. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Jharkhand, contended the Supreme Court must give “free hand” to states to decide on the quantum of reservation and it should not be decided by the judiciary. “If you go to the hinterland of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Bihar, Odisha then you will see how people are crying for education and jobs. The states have failed to provide them schools and teachers. It has to be done by the government on ground and not by the court. If the government fails, then let the people decide and vote them out. Please take a liberal and dispassionate approach on the issue. Law is not static and it should change to fulfil the needs and requirements of changing times as change is inherent in every decision-making process,” Sibal said. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta then intervened and said the Centre had nothing more to add to what the attorney general told the bench and the 102nd constitution amendment did not take away the rights of states to identify backward classes. Bihar and Rajasthan also contended the number of backward classes had increased and 50% reservation was not enough to uplift these communities. Senior advocate Manish Singhvi, appearing for Rajasthan, said the number of OBCs has doubled in the last 26 years as the number was 54 in the list, and is now 91. He said the Indra Sawhney judgment itself allowed more than 50% in some cases and it should not be treated as “Lakshman Rekha”. Advocate Manish Kumar, appearing for Bihar, told the bench the number of OBCs had increased from 129 in 1993 to 174. “Equality cannot be viewed as a snapshot or a still image and should rather be viewed like a film in continuity. Equality or lack of it in 1992 cannot be the same in 2021. The 50% ceiling was a judicially deprived principle based on the prevailing societal conditions then. The obligation of the state to uplift the backward sections of society is constrained to an extent by the judgement of Indra Sawhney as it permits breaching the cap of 50% in extremely exceptional circumstances,” he said. Other states including Karnataka, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh also took a similar stand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sc-must-give-states-free-hand-to-decide-quantum-of-quota/articleshow/81658900.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The incident reportedly took place on February 22. The complainant, whose husband works at Surat GIDC, filed a complaint in this regard with the Vastrapur police. In her FIR, the woman, who is a resident of Kim area said she met accused Rakesh Pandey a year ago when he began living in her neighbourhood. They got into a relationship which continued even after Pandey moved to Ahmedabad city. On February 20, Pandey called the woman and asked the woman to meet him. Pandey reportedly asked her to come to a residential building near Mansi Circle where they were supposed to stay together in the security cabin. She said that when she reached there, Pandey’s friend Suresh Yadav, a security guard, was also present there. On the night of February 21, Pandey and Yadav allegedly got drunk in the presence of the complainant. “Pandey told the complainant to please his friend. When she refused, Pandey broke the window and put a sliver of glass on her neck, threatening to kill her if she did not succumb to his demand.

The highest number of cases in a day in first wave had been 2,343 on September 13 last year, until there was a single day spike of 3,796 cases on March 18. After witnessing peak in last two weeks of August and entire September, cases were on decline till second week of February. Second wave kicked-off from third week of February and cases surged to a great extent from first day of March. The district has registered 49,983 cases in 23 days of March and surpassed the figure of 48,457 recorded in September last year. The cases in September last year were the highest among all months in the year-long pandemic till Tuesday. The cases in March in 11 districts of Vidarbha have surpassed the figure of September last year a couple of days ago. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Zilla Parishad (ZP) in association with private laboratories have performed record number of 2,62,830 tests in 23 days of March. This number was 1,96,722 in September 2020. Total number of tests has crossed 15 lakh in the district on Tuesday. With spike in cases in March, total number of cases in the district crossed 2 lakh as per data of state government. There were 2,03,299 cases in state’s data up to 5pm on Tuesday. There were 1,99,771 cases as per Nagpur district civil surgeon data, as updated up to 12midnight. Among 35 districts in the state, Nagpur has become fourth to cross 2 lakh cases. Pune district is leading with 4,81,212 cases followed by Mumbai 3,69,451 and Thane 3,11,191. The cases in district are more than Nashik district (1,53,503) despite population of the latter being higher. It took 185 days for the district to register first 50,000 cases whereas second came in 50 days. Again, third 50,000 took 121 days. The latest 50,000 cases were recorded in only 22 days. On Tuesday, there were 33,160 active cases and district probably continued to be the second highest in the country after Pune (43,590). There are fewer deaths in second wave as compared to first one. The district recorded 362 fatalities in 23 days of March. There were 919 deaths in August, 1,465 in September and 618 in October last year. The case fatality rate (CFR) is also very less in March. CFR was 3.8% in August followed by 3.02% in September and 3.55% in October last year. The CFR of March is 0.72% due to high number of cases. On Tuesday, number of fatalities in city crossed 3,000, making it third among all municipal corporation areas in the state after Mumbai (11,604) and Pune (4,672) to cross this mark. TOI was the first to report on March 18 about National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, detecting UK strain (B.1.1.7) in swab sample of 48-year-old woman from Wardha and acknowledged the strain as variant of concern (VoC). The woman had no travel history and probably contracted the disease after met her family members in city. Citing this case, guardian minister Nitin Raut said on March 20 say that some changes have been observed in the strain and “the exact situation will only be known after getting the results of the genome sequencing of 92 swab samples sent from the district”. Experts, including infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, have said there are high chances of the mutated variant driving the transmission in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/second-wave-more-severe-march-cases-highest-in-pandemic-top-september-peak/articleshow/81658006.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Nagpur||WII study finds 44% of Indian forests affected by lantana||NAGPUR: With 44% of India’s forests, including 269 protected areas (PAs), under the grip of lantana, an invasive species which has degraded rich biodiversity and associated services, the MoEFCC has asked the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) to form a multi-disciplinary group of experts from leading institutes to prepare a comprehensive roadmap on ecology. As reported by TOI in August 2020, research by three Wildlife Institute of India (WII) scientists, including Ninad Mungi, Qamar Qureshi and YV Jhala, have found that over 300,000sqkm (44%) of the total Indian forests are affected by lantana. The survey was conducted in 2009-2010, in the forests of Shivalik Hills in the north, Central India and the southern Western Ghats. Taking a cue from the WII study, on March 11, 2021, the director-general forest (DGF) Sanjay Kumar has asked WII, Indian Plywood Industries Research & Training Institute (IPIRTI), Bengaluru, Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM), and other bodies to decide on economics and management of lantana in Indian forests. Talking to TOI, Mungi, the lead author of the study, welcomed the move. “It motivates researchers and conservation reporters, activists, etc who worked for highlighting this issue in a scientific manner.” “It is important to not only remove an invasive species from the system but also to restore the system that is degraded by prolonged invasions. It is now essential to scientifically conduct management experiments in different forest systems in India on restoration. It is not yet done and would require scientific involvement and investment. I hope the proposal submitted by these institutions is considered,” said Mungi. The MoEFCC has said that the lantana was brought to India 200 years ago and these varieties have hybridized among themselves and have formed several complexes. In light of lantana’s introduction history that suggests excessive hybridization. This adaptive nature can increase the area under its invasion and pose an ecological conundrum of managing an evolving neophyte. MoEFCC says though eradicating lantana is being practiced in many PAs, these efforts have been meagre compared to their large-scale invasion. There have been small experiments to make furniture, charcoal, fencing material, etc but none of them have been scaled up to the economic utility level till date. “Given the prevalence of the species, the multi-disciplinary team of experts should focus on the economic utility and industrial usage of lantana and on minimizing negative environmental impacts both due to lantana or its removal,” said MoEFCC officials. The environment ministry is ready for funding under the national CAMPA fund. However, as per the study, at rough estimates, its management is estimated to cost around Rs 14 lakh per sqkm in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wii-study-finds-44-of-indian-forests-affected-by-lantana/articleshow/81658014.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

In his FIR with Ranip police, Shadab Qureshi, 27, who has been in jail since 2018 in a murder case, stated that Shabbir Rangrej and his brother Shahrukh assaulted him and his friend Sameer Qureshi. The Rangrejs are in jail for a 2019 murder. Qureshi said, “I was offering namaz on Monday evening and Shabbir was reading the Quran. But he was constantly abusing another inmate. I told Shabbir not to utter abuses while reading the Quran. Shabbir told me that he would teach me a lesson later.” At 11.15pm on Monday, the Rangrej brothers attacked Qureshi with a blade and a stick. When Sameer tried to rescue him, he was also assaulted. The two suffered injuries to their face, neck and shoulders and were taken to Civil Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/2-assaulted-by-fellow-jail-inmates/articleshow/81658007.cms||---
---||Kolkata||IIEST plans to bring back 300 students in April||Kolkata: At least 300 final-year PG students and research scholars at IIEST are set to be brought back to the Shibpur campus in April. The administration took the decision after a meeting with students. IIEST director Partha Sarathi Chakrabarti has decided on a phased re-opening of the campus for which safety several measures are being taken. The institute is trying to re-arrange students’ accommodation in such a way that no none has to share a room. Partitions are being erected in some big rooms so that when more students come in, they don’t have to share space. Students in the senate meeting had said the final-year PG students and research scholars were missing out on lab practice sessions and online teaching could not bridge the gap. “Every day is crucial for us and we are losing out on time. Please call us back to the campus so that we can start lab practicals,” they had said. The institute is re-working the lab schedules so that fewer than 10 students can be together at a time. “It depends on the lab size. We are working around the routines. Teachers would have to repeat the sessions, but all of us are prepared to do so. Students will bring life back to the campus and we are looking forward to it,” said Nirmalya Bhattacharya, faculty in charge of public relations. The institute is also making alternative arrangements for the dining hall and students will have to eat within a stipulated window.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iiest-plans-to-bring-back-300-students-in-april/articleshow/81658012.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

While walking back home, the duo snatched her gold chain,” sub-inspector Dhiraj Gupta of the Alankar police said. “The motorcycle rider was wearing a helmet and his description is not available. The pillion rider was donning a cap. The area where the incidence took place does not have CCTV surveillance,” he said, adding that police were looking for CCTV footage from the neighbouring locality to identify the suspects. “The woman did not suffer any injuries in the incidence.

---||Pune||Sharp drop in advance booking as flyers wait till the last minute||PUNE: Before the pandemic struck, it was a common practice for many vacationers to book their flight tickets months in advance to get the best possible deal. Now, with mercurial, state-specific travel regulations and a rise in Covid-19 cases, many have taken to waiting till the last minute. Take Amit Kumar Sinha for instance. The Patna resident who works in Pune planned to visit his hometown for Holi this month. With less than a week left for the festival, he has yet to book his flight tickets. “I will book the ticket by Thursday. I am not very concerned about the cost. The pandemic has taught me to be patient and check all travel regulations till last moment. I don’t want to be caught because of a sudden change,” he told TOI. The frequently changing travel regulations and restrictions are among the top reasons many flyers have dropped the idea of advance-booking air tickets. Many travel agents said their clients were not too concerned about the higher fares. “Those planning vacations and trips home have always booked their tickets well in advance — two months or more — due to the dynamic fares. All that has changed now as flyers prefer to wait till the last moment to ensure they don’t face unnecessary trouble. Many of my clients traveling to different holiday destinations give me the go-ahead to book tickets a week (or less) in advance,” Nilesh Bhansali, director of Travel Agents’ Association of Pune, said. Another travel agent said Maharashtra being among the worst-affected states in the country was a major factor. “For those traveling from Maharashtra, several states have regulations, like carrying negative RT-PCR issued within a specific time window, mandatory home quarantine, among others. Maharashtra too has regulations for those arriving Delhi, Goa, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Kerala. While we constantly are in fear of new regulations, fresh rules are often issued suddenly, catching many off-guard. The best thing to do is wait till the last moment for new regulations and ensure there are no hassles with booked tickets. A major problem for flyers and agents is getting refunds from airlines,” the agent said. Kuldeep Kirpe, who recently travelled to Goa with his wife, said he booked flight tickets three days in advance. “I had paid for the resort room in advance but then, cases started to rise in Pune. I held on till the last moment for travel curbs in Goa, but when that didn’t happen, I booked my air tickets and proceeded on the holiday,” Kirpe said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sharp-drop-in-advance-booking-as-flyers-wait-till-the-last-minute/articleshow/81656999.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: ICUs full, spillover patients on stretchers in private hospitals||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation and district administrations are emphasizing on early hospitalization to prevent deterioration of Covid infection but both seem to be not doing enough to help citizens find a bed. Patients and relatives have been left on their own to scramble for beds which they get only after frantic calls and social media posts hoping to catch the attention of friends and acquaintances. Those who finally get hospitalization say they were fortunate to get admission against discharge of another patient in private hospitals. These aggrieved citizens also did not get any help from medical colleges who are turning away many Covid patients. Private hospitals said they are accommodating patients on stretchers and stopped allotting private rooms for individual stay. Some private hospitals added more beds in their ICUs which were occupied within minutes on Monday night and Tuesday morning. Each major private hospital has put up a wait list of at least 20 to 25 patients. Amid this, some hospitals sought ventilators as their equipment fell short. On Tuesday, the NMC showed 388 O2 beds, 100 ICU and 56 ventilators vacant in private hospitals. The vacancy in government and civic hospitals was 195 O2, 67 ICU and 94 ventilators. Most of the ICU and ventilator bed are available in medical colleges, which have claimed manpower short to run them. But some private hospitals said as some of their patients tested positive they were now asked to start Covid treatment and not refuse anyone. There were no ICU and ventilator beds available in big hospitals. Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA) convenor Dr Anup Marar said patients are getting admissions only if another patients is getting cured and discharged. “Unlike previous wave, patient in genuine need of hospitalization are coming. 50% of them need 14 or more days stay. Every day, 10% discharge take places but it is filled up within an hour as many are waiting in casualty to get in,” he said. Dr Marar added that procedural delay from insurance providers is eating up precious time of hospitals and patients. “As a stakeholder in this Covid war, insurance companies must fast-track the process. If we inform them around 10am, the patient gets clearance only at 6pm while others keep waiting. We can’t let a patient go without their approval. Handling cashless is becoming a headache,’ he said, adding that all details are available online yet the insurers are following time consuming process. Regarding equipment, Dr Marar said private hospitals are compelled to shift a patient when their resources are exhausted. “VHA has sought multi-colour para monitors and ventilators which may be not in use at government facilities. We can add more Covid CCU beds if we get this help,” he said. Additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma said the NMC has approached the divisional commissioner and the deputy director of health services to see if private hospitals can be given some ventilators. “There is no policy but it was done earlier too on the divisional commissioner’s approval,” he said. Regarding beds, Sharma said in the last two days NMC has added 225 beds. “We are adding more and a zone-wise list has been provided to our helpline. People can call them a get a bed,” he said. In a late night development, the Nagpur bench of HC allowed GMCH to use the hospital basement to run 90-beds for Covid patients. The HC had ordered basement ward had to be shut in August last year after water leakage due to incessant rains. The GMCH, in its application in a sou motu PIL based on a 2020 TOI report, requested the court to modify its order dated Sept 29, 2020 and permit the respondent to utilize the 90 beds in the basement. The hearing was held at 10.15pm as around 50 -60 patients were waiting outside GMCH wards for admission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/icus-full-spillover-patients-on-stretchers-in-pvt-hosps/articleshow/81658016.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Pune||Maharashtra: More child marriages, rise in perversity in pandemic||PUNE: An increase in child marriages, more perversity in sexual abuse cases and violence in physical assault cases within households are some worrying factors in the cases reported to Dnyana Devi Childline between March 2020 and March 2021. There were 51 cases of child marriages, many from the Daund-Indapur-Baramati belt and from the fringes of Pune, Chakan and Rajgurunagar. Several cases came to light after the male friends of the girls getting married, or someone who wanted to marry the girl came to know of the marriage and called the helpline. However, this year has been particularly hard when it came to monitoring such cases, as many a times, the villagers would get the girl, aged 13 to 14, married on their farms or at home, without calling any guests. Pune Zilla Parishad chief executive officer (CEO) Ayush Prasad had the same observation about college-going women. He said in many rural areas, weddings are being organised on the sly since the parents do not need to spend on a lavish one as guests can be limited citing Covid-19 regulations. There were cases of college-going women who were legally of age but forced to quit studies and get married. “The families have become innovative in order to avoid police scrutiny. They say they are going to fix the alliance but get the girl married. Or both the families will get their daughter and son to exchange garlands and the girl wears the mangalsutra,” Anuradha Sahasrabudhe, director Dyana Devi Childline, said. “Earlier, they would get the ceremony done in front of people or at least in temples, but now they are bypassing the ceremony itself making it hard to catch them. We were able to prevent at least 75% of such cases with the help of local police,” she added. There is more use of violence as well as repeats in both sexual harassment cases and physical assault cases. Covid-19 has led to people being confined to homes. Houses in the city are generally smaller in the area leading to lesser privacy. Add to it their financial woes and pent up energy. All this is causing a lot of anxiety leading to friction and physical abuse as well as domestic violence problems, she said. “We had a case where an IT professional who had lost her job was facing domestic abuse and her daughter too was being beaten up. She was so frustrated that she left the house with her children, walked 15 km till a railway station and called us from someone’s cellphone,” Sahasrabudhe added. Childline is a 24-hour, toll-free helpline for children in distress. This is a national programme operational in 83 cities and monitored by the National Childline Foundation actively supported by the Union ministry of women and child development. Dnyana Devi is operating the helpline for cases in Pune, the official website said. The helpline will complete 20 years in Pune on March 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-child-marriages-rise-in-perversity-in-pandemic/articleshow/81656995.cms||Ardhra Nair

The water from the ghats, after washing of saris, in Bhesan, Sukpur and Bhat villages was released into rivers Uben and Ozat. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) officials said that ghats used to release untreated water containing toxic chemicals into the two rivers. There sari industry of Junagadh and Jetpur are famous for making various kinds of saris. On Tuesday, raids at the ghats were conducted jointly by the teams of GPCB, mamaltdar office, Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Ltd and police. Visavadar prant officer D V Vala in a statement said, “The ownership of the land on which the ghats were constructed will be ascertained using GPS. If it is found to be government land, we will lodge a case under new land grabbing act.” The district administration will also lodge police complain of violation of land usage condition, illegal electricity connection and also for polluting natural resources, against the people operating or managing the ghats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/13-illegal-ghats-to-wash-saris-razed-in-junagadh/articleshow/81657037.cms||---
---||Pune||Retired IPS officer loses Rs 10,000 to cybercrook||Pune: A retired IPS officer from Kothrud was recently duped of Rs10,000 by a crook posing as an employee of an online food delivery service. The former officer, 83 years old, has since blocked his debit card and lodged an FIR with the police. The incident occurred last December, when the octogenarian was searching online for a contact number of a popular food delivery app, as he wanted to order some food. He came across a contact number — purportedly that of the food delivery app’s customer care -- and contacted it. “The person who answered told me I needed to register to avail myself of the service, and transferred the call to another person, who asked me which mode of payment I would prefer to pay the registration charges,” the complainant told TOI. He said he would like to pay using his debit card. “The person took down my debit card details and asked me for the card verification value (CVV) number. Though I was hesitant, I shared that number too,” he said. The complainant said the caller asked him to share a one-time password he would get over an SMS. “I shared the OTP but got suspicious when he asked me whether I used any other debit or credit cards. I told him I didn’t need his service and disconnected,” he said. Sometime later, his bank sent him an SMS about suspicious transactions in his account and suggested that he block his card. “I blocked my card and went to the branch and came to know that Rs10,000 was transferred from my account to someone else’s account,” he said. The Kothrud police have registered a case under the relevant sections of the Information Technology Act. Last November, an assistant police sub-inspector was cheated to the tune of Rs 1.30 lakh after his debit card was cloned and misused. The policeman had stated in his complaint that the card was cloned when he had gone for shopping on November 1, 2020. The fraud came to light three days later when he received SMS alerts about cash withdrawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/retired-ips-officer-loses-rs-10000-to-cybercrook/articleshow/81657018.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Mumbai||Aamir Khan’s talk show clip of cop explaining ‘vasooli’ goes viral||MUMBAI: From petty bribes to extortion, the police’s ‘vasooli’ operation in Mumbai seems to be an ill-kept secret. A video clip from actor Aamir Khan’s old talk show ‘Satyamev Jayate’ has resurfaced on social media. It shows the studio guest, senior IPS officer Sanjay Pandey, explaining the nature of bribes taken by the police and how they are “distributed through a system”. In the viral video, Khan, the host, says, “The public view is that we see police constables taking bribes from people in the street, from the common man, the autorickshaw driver, everybody. You are saying that he earns less. But he seems to be collecting quite a lot of money from us. So his income should be quite good.” The actor then turns to the live studio audience and asks: “Am I right?” and they cheer. Pandey replies, “Well, if the earnings remained with the bribe-seeker, it would be so. But I don’t think the poor fellow is able to take home the entire amount that he collects.” When Khan probes the question, Pandey enunciates, “We live in a democracy. Everyone is aware there is a hierarchy. A man has his seniors and they have their seniors. Then there are our politicians. It’s a chain. A whole chain.” The senior IPS officer adds, “Let me explain this in a structured way for the understanding of the common man. There are two kinds of corruption. One is disorganised. That is where say, you are asked to produce your licence on the road. But you don’t have one so you make a request and some ‘adjustment’ is made. This is disorganised. He (the policeman) does not know how many people he will apprehend, how much each person will pay on a given day. The other kind is structured and organised. We have restaurants, FL-3 licences, liquor bars. In Maharashtra, there are dance bars. There is a ban but they are still running in some places. This is organised settlement, institutional collection. Here everybody knows the budgetary estimate because there is a certain number of restaurants and bars.” Pandey says to Khan, “Say you have your studio which is functional till late night. So you will have to pay. This is institutionalised corruption. There isn’t a documented constitution but it exists. It’s a fact.” Pandey, the seniormost IPS officer of Maharashtra, plans to approach Bombay HC challenging the state’s decision to appoint an acting DGP, in violation of the SC verdict. Pandey’s main contention is that the appointment is an ‘arbitrary exercise’ to promote some officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-aamirs-talk-show-clip-of-cop-explaining-vasooli-goes-viral/articleshow/81658905.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Foresters to get cash rewards from sale of seized material||NAGPUR: In a move that will encourage and motivate frontline staff, Sironcha forest division under Gadchiroli circle has decided to give cash reward to foresters from the amount collected as fine and sale of confiscated goods involved in forest crime. Sironcha deputy conservator of forest (DyCF) Sumeet Kumar said, “We will distribute over Rs2.72 lakh to 28 foresters, guards and van majoors. The amount is about 50% of the total received from sale of old vehicles, tools and other material seized in forest crime cases from 2010 to 2016 and court has already decided them in favour of the forest department.” APCCF (Protection) and state’s nodal officer Sanjeev Gaur says, “Under the Indian Forest Act (IFA), 1927, there is a provision under Rule 83 which empowers CCFs and DyCFs to reward with cash benefits to staff with whose assistance the conviction was secured or the property was liable for confiscation.” However, even though Rule 83 is in place since the British era, it has been implemented only by a handful of forest officials like KK Chavan, Tasneem Ahmed, Gaur himself, Piyusha Jagtap and now Sumeet Kumar. “As deputy conservator in Buldhana in 2007, I had rewarded 24 persons with Rs62,500 invoking the same rule. The benefit was also passed on to the police staff, which assisted in conviction and cracking the crime,” said Gaur. In December, 2020, deputy conservator Piyusha Jagtap, who was with Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR), had rewarded the staff with Rs52,000 recovered from three criminal cases. The amount was recovered after auctioning the cattle confiscated while grazing illegally in the tiger reserve. Officials, however, said due to a lack of awareness about the said provision, the reward scheme is not implemented in the right spirit, even though a large number of forest offences are registered. In view of this, on January 6, 2021, APCCF Gaur wrote to all APCCFs, CCFs, DyCFs, and DFOs to invoke the provision, barring court matters, to encourage senior officials to make use of the provision also mentioned in Maharashtra Forest Rules, 2014. “Officials are empowered to distribute 50% of the reward money received from the sale proceeds of tools and vehicles to staff and persons who helped in cracking the crime and also assisted in conviction. Sironcha is the first division to implement the decision after issuance of the orders,” said Gaur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/foresters-to-get-cash-rewards-from-sale-of-seized-material/articleshow/81658019.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Kolkata||Daughter might not be lone accused in dad murder case||Kolkata: The probe into the murder of Christopher Road resident Biswanath Auddy (56) has revealed that his daughter, Piyali Auddy (22), might not be the only accused. Police said they were certain another person was involved. “The way the murder was executed showed a lone person could not have plotted it,” said a Lalbazar officer. Officers are trying to find out the motive. “Though Piyali claims she committed the murder as her father tormented her mentally and hit her when drunk, a property angle has to be probed. Her claim of her father hitting her has not found resonance with her joint family. We have learnt that after Piyali returned to this home following her divorce, she rarely cooked. Her father had to depend on his brother for food,” police said. “We will record family members’ statements.” Kartik Auddy, the victim’s brother, is being questioned. After taking Piyali to a few locations in the city for leads on Tuesday, police said it now appeared she brought her father directly to Chandpal Ghat after leaving the home through the backdoor on Saturday evening. “We have analyzed CCTV footage between Tangra and Chandpal Ghat. We are trying to locate the cabby who drove them there,” said an officer. Cops are still piecing together the sequence of events. “Her father did not suspect anything amiss as she had brought him there once earlier. She then plied him with drinks, and then set him on fire,” said a homicide wing officer. “After returning home, the accused on Sunday kept asking her uncle, Kartik, who later lodged a complainant, about her ‘missing’ father. She claimed she was unaware of his whereabouts as she was at ID Hospital for stomach cramps.” Police said Piyali was proving to be a difficult person to crack. “She is revealing very little and giving convoluted statements. She is hiding evidence,: said an officer. Her aunt, Dipali Dutta, told TOI Piyali had returned home within a year of getting married and had not maintained a cordial relationship with anyone in the family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/daughter-might-not-be-lone-accused-in-dad-murder-case/articleshow/81658035.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Ahmedabad||RT-PCR test now mandatory for entry from Maharashtra||AHMEDABAD: After its neighbouring states Maharashtra and Rajasthan, Gujarat on Tuesday announced a mandatory negative RT-PCR test report for Covid-19 for entry into the state from Maharashtra. The notification from the state health department says that the test should have been conducted no more than 72 hours before the entry. The order adds that ‘a high number of cases’ that tested positive in Gujarat in the recent times had returned from Maharashtra or had come in contact with thos who did, thus they found the step necessary. ‘All those entering Gujarat from Maharashtra must be screened,’ added the order. It needs mention that the two states share high traffic due to economic and cultural relationship between south Gujarat and north Maharashtra. The Ahmedabad-Mumbai corridor is also one of the busiest in the country. The order came in the wake of yet another peak at 1,730cases in the 24 hours ending 5pm on Tuesday. The figure translates to 18 cases every 15 minutes. The state also recorded four Covid deaths – two each from Ahmedabad and Surat. Ahmedabad on Tuesday became the first city of Gujarat to record 500-plus cases at 502. The city accounted for 29% of the state’s total cases in 24 hours. Ahmedabad and Surat cities recorded 56.5% of the cases, effectively contributing to one of every two cases in Gujarat. The number of patients at private hospitals of Ahmedabad crossed 1,000 on Tuesday, said AHNA officials. Against the state’s test positivity rate (TPR) of 2.5% in the past 24 hours, Ahmedabad district’s TPR was 4.4% and Surat’s 3%. “While a surge is seen in several states of India, Gujarat has witnessed made a major jump in seven days. The four major cities have recorded the major share, but Ahmedabad and Surat are recording quick doubling of cases,” said a city-based epidemiologist. “The high number of tests and high TPR are the reasons. On the positive side, the share of hospitalized patients is lower compared to the previous surge.” With a high number of cases at the Sachivalaya in Gandhinagar, the state government has decided to start widespread testing and vaccination of staff and contracted workers from Wednesday onwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rt-pcr-test-now-mandatory-for-entry-from-maha/articleshow/81658223.cms||---

As per the complaint, the woman transferred the money to a bank account — the details of which were provided by the suspect — through three transactions on January 26. The woman registered the FIR on Monday, in which she stated she was at home when she got a phone call from an unknown number. The caller identified himself as the son of a retired colonel, who was a close friend of her father, a retired Army captain. As per the FIR, the caller told the woman that he had brought his ailing father from the US to India for an emergency medical procedure and asked for her financial assistance. “The suspect told the complainant that he needed Rs1.90 lakh for his father’s surgery and that he would repay the money at the earliest. He asked her to transfer the money via net-banking to a bank account and shared the account number and other details with her,” a police officer said. “The woman, without verifying the credentials of the caller, transferred the money through three transactions to the bank account, which we traced to Uttar Pradesh. The suspect later transferred the money to two other bank accounts,” inspector (crime) Mangesh Jagtap of the Airport police said. Jagtap said the woman realized she had been duped when she later made inquiries and discovered that it was a bogus call. “Her father’s friend had not undergone any surgery, nor had they sought financial assistance from her. She submitted a complaint application at the cybercrime police station soon after the incident,” Jagtap said. “The cybercrime cell conducted a preliminary inquiry and identified the bank accounts into which the money was transferred. After her complaint application was transferred to us, we recorded the woman’s statement and lodged an FIR related to cheating under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/caller-uses-surgery-trick-fleeces-woman-of-rs-1-9l/articleshow/81657033.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Terai farmers gear up for Bharat bandh on Friday||RUDRAPUR: The farmers' union in the Terai region have started mass mobilisation of farmers, seeking legal guarantee to the minimum support price (MSP) on the sale of agricultural produce and withdrawal of three farm laws. The ongoing mass mobilisation of farmers, by their respective unions is being seen as a build-up to the Bharat bandh called by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee on March 26. This nationwide strike on Friday is likely to have an impact on the Terai region even as the farmer leaders said that no one should be forced to join the shutdown. City traders' union president Sanjay Juneja said, “We organised a meeting and it was decided that those traders who extend support to the farmers' movement will keep their shops closed willfully on March 26.” Terai Kisan Mahasabha president Tejender Singh Virk said that more than 3,000 farmers from the district reached Ghazipur and other borders on Tuesday to pay tribute to legendary freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru. "The numbers will further increase on Friday on the proposed Bharat bandh.” Jagar Singh Bajwa, spokesperson of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), at Ghazipur border claimed the bandh will be effective across the country. "Emergency services will be allowed during Bharat bandh. We have appealed to the farmers to maintain peace and not to enter into any scuffle to enforce the bandh. This bandh will strengthen our movement and the Centre will have to roll back these draconian agri laws.” President of the city Congress, Jagdish Taneja said that the Congress party supports the AIKSCC's call of Bharat Bandh. "We will be organising protests and dharnas against the Central government all across the city. We want the three agri reform laws to be repealed immediately", he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/terai-farmers-gear-up-for-bharat-bandh-on-friday/articleshow/81657067.cms||Aakash Ahuja

The freedom fighter who later made a living as a textile engineer with a textile major says the country needs freedom from Corona and getting the jab is the duty of every citizen to protect himself and others by curbing the spread of the virus. Patel, a resident of Bopal, got vaccinated and reported no side effects. In fact, Patel, who lives with his paternal cousin, his wife and another family member, managed to evade Covid-19 when it struck close to home ahead of Diwali. All three members got infected but Patel was spared. “Of course, we isolated ourselves and quarantined him safely we think it was more the result of his robust immunity,” says Pankaj, the son of Patel’s paternal aunt. Patel says he does not suffer any lifestyle disease like hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol and has managed to keep disease at bay largely due to his childhood habit of walking long distances. “I would walk to school. In Mumbai, I would walk some 10km to college. I kept up that habit in adult life and continued long morning walks till I turned 98. After a bad fall, my family does not allow me to walk outdoors but I walk inside the house for 30-45 minutes every day. Our bodies are designed to move, a sedentary lifestyle makes the body prone to illnesses,” says Patel who would walk long distances to listen to Independence heroes like Mahatma Gandhi and other tall leaders during the Quit India movement. Patel says he loves his fafda-jalebi but otherwise eats in moderation. “Less food, less stress and more exercise is the key to good health,” says Patel who urges all eligible citizens to get Covid-19 vaccines and help beat the pandemic. Dr Bharat Bhagat, a philanthropist and hospital owner, said his entire staff was inspired when Patel took the Covid-19 shot. “He is an inspiration to everyone,” said Dr Bhagat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/100-year-old-gets-his-shot-of-protection-from-corona/articleshow/81658152.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Palaniappan says during his campaign how he is incapable of taking on the money power of Vijaya Baskar. But he feels so attached to the people that it makes him work tirelessly to get an opportunity to serve them. “Vijaya Baskar has his father and brother as his support system. However for me, people like you are my father and brothers ,” he said at a campaign. He broke down while saying that he is standing before them after losing everything and they should make him win this time. “Palaniappan who is into real estate has suffered losses and in fact he had to sell his petrol pump and a house in Trichy recently,” said a DMK party functionary. Vijaya Baskar counters this saying one should not act in front of voters. “It will not be appropriate if I come with teary eyes asking you to help me retrieve the property I lost. If I have lost something, that is my problem,” he said. However, Vijaya Baskar too was not far behind in making an emotional appeal to voters. He said he lost 7.5 kg during Covid-19 pandemic lockdown working for the people. He is suffering from diabetes and hypertension for which he has been taking tablets. He would not have suffered had he concentrated on his health by taking proper rest and following a healthy diet. “I have carried the constituency and its people on my shoulder as Jesus Christ did for his people. I believe that Jesus would bless me through you,” he said at a locality with Christian population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/vijaya-baskar-invokes-jesus-palaniappan-cries/articleshow/81658036.cms||Sampath Kumar

A bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and NR Borkar set aside a 2013 conviction by a Raigad-Alibag trial court that had sentenced him to life imprisonment. The teacher, who taught high school, was 32 years old when he appealed in 2014. He was lodged at Kolhapur central prison since his arrest in 2010. The child had alleged that “her drawing teacher” had committed the crime after obstructing her on the way to the washroom and that “another male teacher had gagged her”. She identified the accused in court and said she knew he was not her teacher, but “was informed that he is her drawing teacher”. After analysing the evidence, the HC said the child’s case was the crime occurred during the recess, but the accused had left the school premises an hour earlier. There were eight prosecution and five defence witnesses including the school principal and a couple of staff. The HC said defence witnesses must be given “equal weightage”. The principal had “certified the accused as a sincere teacher”. Two defence witnesses said the child had pointed to a photo of another male staffer as the alleged perpetrator, but her parents disbelieved her saying he could not have committed such a crime. The high court said the parents’ conduct “does not appeal to a prudent mind”. The prosecutor said since a laboratory was on the same floor as the washroom “in all probability, the accused could be the person who had abused the victim”. But the high court said, “There has to be cogent and convincing evidence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/teacher-to-walk-free-11-years-after-arrest-in-minor-students-rape-case-in-mumbai/articleshow/81658912.cms||---

The 75-year-old leader is set to return to AIADMK in the presence of chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami in Karur on Wednesday. Chinnasamy chose to return to AIADMK after DMK denied him ticket to contest either from Manapparai or Aravakurichi for which he had applied. “It was unfortunate that a better candidate like me was not offered a party ticket,” he told reporters in Karur. He said it was a ‘kitchen cabinet’ in Stalin’s family which robbed him of a party ticket though he had direct access to the leadership. “I was not interested in making backdoor negotiations. Therefore, I decided to return to AIADMK,” he said. On working under chief minister Palaniswami, who was his junior in the party, Chinnasamy said cadres have become leaders in AIADMK, and he will work with them. Chinnasamy was elevated to deputy general secretary of AIADMK under former chief minister J Jayalalithaa. He was elected from Karur assembly constituency twice and had served as industries minister under Jayalalithaa. He was elected to Lok Sabha in 1999. Chinnasamy was expelled from AIADMK in 2010 following which he joined DMK.

---||Pune||Sessions court seal on Ekbote’s anticipatory bail in Haj House row||PUNE: A sessions court on Tuesday confirmed the anticipatory bail granted to Samasta Hindu Aghadi leader Milind Ekbote in a case registered on March 5 by the Pune police on the charge of making objectionable comments while opposing the proposed Haj House project on a civic land in Kondhwa. Additional sessions judge G P Agarwal observed, “Considering the allegations in the FIR and the investigations done by the police till date, the applicant (Ekbote) can be directed to remain present for interrogation.” The judge, while relying on a Supreme Court ruling in the case of Prabhakar Tewari vs the State of Uttar Pradesh, said there was no bar in granting bail to an accused if several criminal cases were pending against him. Confirming Ekbote’s pre-arrest bail, the court held that his custodial interrogation was not essential because nothing was required to be seized. Sambhaji Brigade activist Bhaskar Kale had filed the FIR against Ekbote with the Kondhwa police alleging that his comments on March 2 had hurt sentiments of a particular community and were intended to disturb peace in the society. Lawyers SK Jain and Amol Dange argued that there was delay of four days in registering the FIR against Ekbote. The lawyers submitted that the FIR was registered with political motive and pleaded to confirm Ekbote’s anticipatory bail because his custodial interrogation was not essential. The prosecution opposed the plea and claimed that Ekbote’s custodial interrogation was essential since he had made his video viral on social media, disturbing sentiments of the community and peace in the society. The court on March 12 had ordered Ekbote’s release on pre-arrest bail in the event of his arrest on executing personal bond of Rs15,000 and surety of like amount and assurance that he would not tamper with the prosecution’s evidence and co-operate with the investigating agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sessions-court-seal-on-ekbotes-anticipatory-bail-in-haj-house-row/articleshow/81657076.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Although the road was widened long back to allow city buses, at least 50% of the road is being misused for parking vehicles and encroachments by the police and shops.State highways department sources said that the Amma Mandapam road was widened in 2015 to 80 feet. The widened lanes are being used as an autorickshaw stand and parking lot, leaving only two lanes for vehicles including city buses to commute between EVS street and Srirangam Rajagopuram, causing congestion even during the non-peak hours. “Not only devotees, but even locals suffer due to the narrowed stretch. Although two more lanes are available adjacent to the existing road, it has been encroached for years,” said T Santhanakrishnan, a resident of Thiruvalluvar street. As city buses are make multiple stops to pick up passengers, it often causes traffic snarls near the Rajagopuram.The state highways and city police have not either done anything to clear the bottlenecks. Apart from causing inconvenience, the people also questioned the rationale behind investing in widening if it was not going to serve its purpose. City police sources, when contacted, said that a solution would be discussed to decongest the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/encroachments-cause-traffic-congestion-near-srirangam-temple/articleshow/81658039.cms||Deepak Karthik

The Thane court has asked the public prosecutor and investigating officer of ATS to file their say on Wednesday. The ATS will oppose the plea on the grounds that the agency has already arrested two people, including convicted cop Vinayak Shinde, and has made substantial progress. “We have almost cracked the case. Secondly, we are still awaiting orders from the state government,” said a source. Sources said NIA moved the court after allegedly seeing non-cooperation from the state over handing over the probe.  But a senior lawyer said the NIA application is a formal procedural request since it is an inter-court transfer of case proceedings from a magistrate to NIA special court. On March 20, the Union home ministry directed NIA, which had earlier taken over the car explosives case, to also investigate the Hiran murder which the state ATS was probing.  Waze is in custody of the NIA in the explosives case. On March 20, ATS also sought custody of Waze.  NIA sought transfer of records including case documents and all articles of the ATS case to the special court at the sessions court in Mumbai “to meet the ends of justice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nia-wants-hiran-case-records-sent-to-spl-court/articleshow/81658915.cms||Ahmed Ali

The spike in cases, backed by increased testing, is faster than at the peak period of the pandemic in July last year. Sample this: At the height of the pandemic in July 2020, it took 15 days for cases to double. On March 16, 2021, active cases in state capital surpassed 1000; it has taken half the time compared to last year, for active cases to double. In nine days since March 16, active cases rose to 2525on Tuesday. Last year it took 19 weeks (from mid-July to December) when active cases peaked to 3200 cases. That record could well be surpassed if the R-factor holds true. R-factor is a measure of how many people are being infected by one infected person. Union ministry of health and family welfare, last week, instructed the state authorities to contact, trace and test approximately 30 people per infection. With a positivity rate of above 5 per cent, more cases are expected to be diagnosed. “Early testing and medical care is key to reducing number of Covid-19 infections. It will also reduce the stress on the health infrastructure. We need to also remember that people from other districts also seek treatment in speciality centres in places like Bhopal,” said a senior consultant at Gandhi Medical College (GMC). All elective leaves in the hospital have been cancelled due to the spiralling number of infections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/active-cases-double-in-9-days-it-took-15-days-at-peak-in-2020/articleshow/81658038.cms||Jamal Ayub
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Raped & set afire, student of ex-minister’s college dies||BAREILLY: Exactly a month after she was allegedly raped and set afire, a 21-year-old student of a degree college run by former Union minister Chinmayanand breathed her last at a hospital in Lucknow. She was set on fire in Shahjahanpur district on February 22 and had sustained over 54% burn injuries above the waist. In her “dying declaration”, the girl had named her friend Sunita (name changed), Sunita’s brother-in-law Manish and an unidentified person. During questioning of the accused, the name of Subhash, Sunita’s cousin, had also come to the fore. All the four persons were arrested and sent to jail. The girl had alleged that she was lured by Sunita, a college friend, to come to a secluded place where she was sedated by the other accused. When she gained her senses, she was being raped by one of them, she had said in the statement. The girl’s father told TOI that in between the assault and the death, she put up a brave face in spite of the enormous pain. “My daughter’s condition had improved during treatment. We were hopeful of her complete recovery. But on Monday, she reported severe and persistent pain. Doctors started her treatment but her pain continued to increase and soon she started gasping for breath. Doctors gave her advanced treatment but she succumbed at 1.30am. She went through enormous pain and fought for life but lost her battle.” The autopsy of the body was conducted by a panel of doctors in Lucknow. The family brought the body to Shahjahanpur on Tuesday night. And the cremation will take place in her village in Kaant area of the district on Wednesday. A student of BA second year, the girl was found along the national highway without clothes and completely burnt above the waist. Shahjahanpur police had invoked IPC sections 376-D (gang-rape), 511 (attempting to commit offence punishable with imprisonment for life), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 307 (attempt to murder) and 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a weapon or means) against the accused. More sections are likely to be added after the death. Shahjahanpur’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) S Anand told TOI, “We had ensured best possible treatment for the victim. We are yet to receive her autopsy report. We have arrested the accused after taking her dying declaration into consideration. We will soon file our investigation report in the court and ensure speedy trial in her case.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/raped-set-on-fire-student-of-chinmayanand-run-college-loses-battle-for-life/articleshow/81657074.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The lawyer too filed a complaint of assault and under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against the woman’s husband and two other persons. According to police, when the woman, who was in Rajkot to visit her brother along with her husband, was seated outside the house, the lawyer Hemant Chavda made lewd gestures at her and made obscene demands. She stated in her complaint that Chavda had been harassing her for the last two days, so she informed her husband about it and later lodged a complaint. As the woman’s husband learnt about the harassment, he and two others — Prakash Parmar and Madhavji Parmar attacked Chavda. The lawyer alleged that the trio beat him mercilessly with iron rods leaving him with a fractured leg. Police said that Chavda and the woman knew each other even before her marriage. After she got married and moved to Jamnagar, the woman cut all ties with Chavda but he continued to pursue her.

---||Goa||Cabinet approval for giving dry food grains to students||Panaji: The state cabinet on Tuesday granted approval for providing dry food grains to students from Class I to VIII for the remaining 165 days as part of the mid-day meal scheme. The state government has already provided 100 days of dry food grains to children. A senior officer said that the state government provides 220 days of mid-day meals to students. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the government decided to provide dry ration for an additional 45 days. The cabinet approved the supply of dry ration equivalent to 165 days of the approved cooking cost, amounting to over Rs 17 lakh, including transportation. The cabinet note stated that the department will provide this dry ration at the schools’ premises through self-help groups and mahila mandals without following the codal formalities. The officer said that parents have to come to the schools to pick up the ration. The cabinet note also stated that the rates chargeable for the dry ration shall be equal or less than the prevailing rates of Goa Marketing and Supply Federation Ltd, Panaji as on the day of supply order. “The headmasters and parent teacher associations should monitor the quality and quantity of the dry ration provided to the students,” the cabinet note stated. The directorate of education is implementing the mid-day meal scheme under the National Programme of Nutritional Support to Primary Education with a 60:40 pattern with the government of India. TOI had reported that as schools remained shut during the pandemic, an analysis of the mid-day meal scheme’s performance was carried out by the Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi, which has shown that Goa was among the states that lifted the least foodgrains upto October 2020. With schools closed, and as mid-day meals could not be served to students, foodgrains were to be initially distributed instead. But Goa picked none of its stock until October 2020, the analysis said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabinet-approval-for-giving-dry-food-grains-to-students/articleshow/81658044.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While other parties rally largely on the digital campaign, the VCK still depends on the traditional style in reaching out to voters. The party wing has roped in around 200 artists to draw at least 3,000 graffiti a day per constituency to publicise the pot symbol. Party sources said that graffiti were drawn on the walls of houses in all the villages in Chidambaram Lok Sabha constituency (reserved) when party leader Thol Thirumavalavan secured the seat in the 2019 parliamentary election. The party is now using the same strategy to popularise the pot symbol in the six assembly segments where the party has fielded candidates — Vanur, Kattumannarkoil, Cheyyur , Arakkonam (all reserved) and the general constituencies of Nagapattinam and Thiruporur. Except for Kattumannarkoil, other segments are seeing VCK in the symbol for the first time. “Unlike the Lok Sabha election, we have only a week left. More than the candidate’s name and our party flag, we are working on registering the symbol among voters,” Oviyar Jayaseelan, state secretary of the artists wing, said. The group is giving priority to DMK and other alliance parties in the exercis to consolidate votes. The drive has also helped the artists earn Rs 1,000 besides food and shelter every day. “Work starts at 8 am and continues till 8 pm. We have set a minimum target of 30,000 graffiti per assembly segment,” Thanjai Lenin, in-charge of Thiruporur segment, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/vcks-artist-wing-to-draw-3000-pot-symbols-per-day/articleshow/81658043.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Chandigarh||Preneet Kaur asks Nirmala Sitharaman to revive MPLAD funds||PATIALA: Patiala MP Preneet Kaur of the Congress on Tuesday, while speaking on a discussion on the finance bill, urged Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to revive MPLAD funds. She again appealed to the minister to enhance the salaries of Asha workers as they have been frontline workers during the pandemic period. On agriculture infrastructure and development cess added by Sitharaman in the Union Budget 2021-22, Preneet said the cess would have a negative impact, affect fiscal federalism, reduce states’ revenue share greatly, and compromise their the ability to maintain the mandate of development. She pointed out that the Finance Bill 2021 contained a number of provisions that might not strictly meet the definition of a money bill, as these provisions did not relate to taxes, borrowing of money from the government, nor expenditure or receipts involving the Consolidated Fund of India. “Pushing such proposals through the finance bill can only be seen as an attempt to evade parliamentary scrutiny as in the case of a money bill the Rajya Sabha does not have rights to reject or amend it. It is quite like the ordinance route adopted by the government to push important legislations, bypassing parliamentary scrutiny,” she said. Calling the minister’s proposal for exempting senior citizens, she said, “Finance minister’s proposition to exempt senior citizens of 75 years age and above from filing income tax returns is an illusion since the concessions proposed by the minister are not unconditional and neither do they imply any exemption from income tax, as was mistakenly presumed by many in a moment of glee. The exemption, in fact, is from filing returns subject to certain conditions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/revive-mplad-funds-preneet-asks-sitharaman/articleshow/81657978.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Devendra Fadnavis: From a restrained CM to a combative Oppn leader||MUMBAI: The mood in the state BJP is palpably upbeat as Devendra Gangadhar Fadnavis takes on the MVA regime, laying bare “corruption in the police” and the “sinister nexus that lies behind routine transfers”. The BJP rank and file thinks Fadnavis’ crusade augurs well for the party, which appeared a tad disconcerted after it lost power to MVA in 2019 despite bagging over 100 seats and needed a rallying point for the 2022 BMC elections. In the past, the former CM has come across as shrill in his role as opposition leader. The Sushant Singh Rajput case and the Kangana Ranaut controversy, to name a few, were instances when he clashed with the MVA regime, but could not sustain the momentum. But Fadnavis has now come into his own following l’affaire Waze, said associates on Tuesday, as he flew out to Delhi to lobby with the Union home secretary for action on the basis of a state intelligence department report containing audio intercepts purportedly pointing to large scale corruption in police transfers and postings. It was the latest salvo from the Vidarbha lawyer-turned-politician in a fast-festering crisis sparked by the Ambani security scare and its fallout. Observers say Fadnavis’ anti-MVA tirade stems chiefly from his ire over the Sena walking out on BJP in 2019. He was stung by Uddhav Thackeray’s somersault, said a friend. Assuming the Sena’s decision to switch sides had a personal impact, he still managed to get under the skin of his role as Opposition leader, dogged in the belief that power commits blunders. A certain Sachin Waze turned out to be the gaffe he was looking for. Fadnavis rolled up his sleeves to tear into the MVA on the floor of the state assembly early this month, producing call data records of the cop investigating the case and the man in whose vehicle the explosives were found. Fadnavis spoke for nearly two hours, shooting holes into government’s claims. “The speech was packed with sensitive details which only higher-ups in the home department have access to,” said a Vidhan Bhavan official. His friends in the police fed him the crucial details, rued an NCP politician, not realising he was paying a compliment to his networking skills. A week later, Saamna, the Sena mouthpiece, also praised Fadnavis, saying in his assembly speech, the Opposition leader struck all the right notes. “Devendraji has an analytical mind. He can fuse facts into a convincing argument. Also, he loves a good fight,” said BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar. Sources said Fadnavis is aware the BJP bosses in Delhi are not keen on toppling the MVA government. Instead, the party may want him to expose contradictions within the ruling coalition and build a strategic edge for itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-from-a-restrained-cm-to-a-combative-oppn-leader/articleshow/81658922.cms||Ambarish Mishra
---||Trichy||Govt cut doles to spend on ads: Kanimozhi||Trichy: DMK women’s wing leader and MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi on Tuesday accused the government of splurging on advertisements instead of paying dole to old age pension scheme beneficiaries. Campaigning for her party’s candidates fielded in assembly constituencies in Trichy city, she said financial assistance stopped by the AIADMK government will be restored once DMK forms the government. Referring to the recent sexual assault complaint lodged by a female IPS officer against her senior, she reiterated that there is no safety for women under the AIADMK government. “Even the female IPS officer was forcibly stopped from going to Chennai for lodging a complaint. To ensure women’s safety, we must put an end to this rule through the ensuing election,” she said. Seeking information regarding the death of former CM J Jayalalithaa, the Tuticorin member of parliament said the commission formed by the Tamil Nadu state government to investigate the death remains inactive. Pointing out the Pollachi sexual assault and extortion case, Kanimozhi said that the victims were denied justice by the state government. She said that unlike the ruling party, opposition parties are facing too many restrictions in hosting election meetings. Listing out the infrastructure projects implemented in Trichy during the DMK regime such as Elcot IT park in Navalpattu and IIM Trichy, Kanimozhi campaigned for DMK candidate Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi fielded in Thiruverumbur. She campaigned for K N Nehru and Inigo Irudhayaraj, the DMK candidates in Trichy West and Trichy East assembly segments later in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/govt-cut-doles-to-spend-on-ads-kanimozhi/articleshow/81658046.cms||---

Ayaz Sheikh, who works as a computer operator at a company on Race Course Road, went to an SBI ATM near Mandvi on last Wednesday to withdraw money. As the machine did not dispense cash, an unidentified man who was present at the ATM kiosk offered to help Sheikh. He took Sheikh’s ATM card and asked him to enter the personal identification number (PIN) after inserting the card, but the cash was not dispensed. The unidentified man stealthily swapped the ATM card with a different one before handing it back to Sheikh, who had no clue about the con. Next morning, Sheikh received several messages informing him about money being debited from his bank account. By the time Sheikh and his mother reached the bank and could give an application to block the card, the conman had withdrawn Rs 70,046. Later, when Sheikh’s sister Sartaj inspected the card, they realized it was not his ATM card. The family realized that the conman had switched the card and while Sheikh was entering the PIN, he must have memorized it. Later, the conman used Sheikh’s card to withdraw money and make purchases. On Monday, Sheikh’s mother Fatimabibi registered a complaint of cheating at City police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/disabled-vadodara-man-duped-of-rs-70k/articleshow/81657105.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Lack of Punjabi, common surname throws London court into confusion||LONDON: A lack of Punjabi and two Indian Sikh men with the surname ‘Singh’ caused confusion at a London court on Tuesday when the barristers got their clients mixed up. Sukwir Singh, 22, and Lakha Singh, 29, both Indian nationals residing in Southall, appeared at Isleworth crown court on Tuesday, charged with threatening others with swords during a large fight involving around 30 Asian men in Southall on 16 January. The case has been due to take place on Monday but adjourned by a day owing to the lack of a Punjabi interpreter and neither men speak English. At first, Lakha appeared by himself in the dock wearing a face mask and a stripey brown jumper with one security official. As the case began, his barrister, Miss Sharma, in a perturbed manner, told the judge: “This is not the same person who I met yesterday in the cells and my Punjabi is not very good.” Syam Soni, the barrister representing the co-defendant Sukhvir Singh, told the court he is fluent in Punjabi. “I had a virtual conference call and I am hoping the person downstairs is my client,” he said to the perplexed judge. The case then had to be adjourned for the barristers to clarify which men were their clients. When it resumed, this time both defendants sat in the dock as Sukhvir had arrived and was sporting an orange turban and face mask. Soni said: “My client is Sukhvir Singh who appears on right in dock. That is not who I spoke to yesterday but the conference yesterday with Lakha contains nothing that poses a problem to anyone.” Since none of the parties objected, the case then continued. The men listened to proceedings through a Punjabi interpreter. They were both charged with being involved in a street brawl on the night of 16 January 2021 in Southall. Lakha pleaded guilty to a charge of affray, namely using or threatening unlawful violence towards another and his conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety. He also pleaded guilty to possession of a sword without good reason or lawful authority. Sukhvir pleaded not guilty to affray and also not guilty to possession of a sword. Sukhvir’s trial will take place on 6 September and Lakha will be sentenced at the conclusion of the trial, judge S Davis ruled. At an earlier bail application on 22 February, the court had heard that Lakha had no status in the UK and was unknown to the immigration authorities until he was arrested. “He is not a refugee. He came illegally into the UK and stayed under the radar until he was arrested,” his then barrister, Mr Khan, had told the court, when seeking bail on a £10,000 surety. The judge had refused to grant Lakha bail saying: “He has come to this country illegally and made no claim of asylum. There is no reason why he wouldn’t go underground or leave the country as he has no passport or address.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/lack-of-punjabi-common-surname-throws-london-court-into-confusion/articleshow/81658056.cms||NAOMI CANTON

People said they noticed the siren blowing in the morning, but could not make out why it was blown. “I could hardly notice anything. There was no siren in my area. Things were normal like any other day," said an elderly woman, Veermata Nirmala Sharma, who resides in the Shahpura area of the city. “I heard a police siren at the market place near my home in the morning. I thought cops have come to catch someone or for patrolling, but had no idea if it was meant for corona awareness”, said Sanjay Kumar a resident of Rachna Nagar. “I was in my shop since morning and did not notice anything unusual. I did not hear any siren sound," said Amit Singh, a shop owner near Manisha Market. The government decided to ring a corona siren at 11 am and 7 pm daily for a few days from Tuesday onwards to remind people to be vigilant, alert and cautious. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/siren-mostly-goes-unheard-people-not-aware-of-motive/articleshow/81658059.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He was addressing a gathering at Sengipatti, which falls under Thiruvaiyaru assembly segment in Thanjavur district, to campaign for his party candidate Poondi S Venkatesan. He said that it is the right time to defeat the opponents. While listing out the schemes and projects sanctioned to Tamil Nadu by the BJP-led Union government, Ravi said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has allotted Rs 6.10 lakh crore to the development of the state. He has provided 11 new medical colleges, 12 smart city projects, 29 women cities and an AIIMS in Madurai. Modi is the real friend of Tamil Nadu. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, who is also our friend, has waived agriculture loans,” he said. While criticizing the DMK, Ravi said that Tamil Nadu is not the family property of the DMK. So, voting for the party would pave way for dynastic politics. “If people of Tamil Nadu wish to avert such a worse situation, they should vote for AIADMK-BJP alliance in the coming assembly elections,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/fight-in-tn-is-between-muruga-his-opponents-c-t-ravi/articleshow/81658058.cms||---

The website aims to create a single-window platform for all tourism-related queries for the Himalayan state. "The website will be regularly updated both in English and Hindi and has well-divided segments to provide up-to-date information about the tourism sector. We are committed to technology, which is indispensable in current times," said Maharaj. New features on the website, https://uttarakhandtourism.gov.in/node/1, include a live chat bot for on-the-spot communication, a list of travel packages, itineraries that contain details of places and prices and can be downloaded, as well as contacts of tour operators. "The new website is more interactive and comes with a new look and theme. We have made sure that the content on it remains crisp and is easily accessible to travelers. Our focus area has been information on popular as well as offbeat destinations, which cover a good part of the website," said secretary, tourism, Dilip Jawalkar. Maharaj also launched a single-window investment portal that aims to promote investment policy in Uttarakhand. This will enable investors to gain information about highlights of tourism activities in the state, incentives and subsidies that can be availed from the Tourism Policy 2018. Jwalakar said that the portal will have information on upcoming projects and all approvals will be provided at a single point, with a dedicated relationship manager to guide investors through the investment life cycle. "For investment of more than Rs 10 crore, a capital subsidy of up to Rs 1.5 cr will be granted, with an interest subsidy of Rs 25 lakh, with a 50% rebate on stamp duty on registration during land purchase. This is a revolutionary step toward promoting tourism in the state," Jwalakar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/new-state-tourism-website-claims-to-be-single-window-platform-for-all-queries/articleshow/81657156.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Delhi||Daily Covid tally past 1,000 for first time this year in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The daily count of Covid-19 in Delhi crossed the 1,000 mark on Tuesday with 1,101 more people testing positive for the viral infection. This is the highest single-day count in nearly three months. On December 19, 1,139 cases were recorded in a single day. Tuesday’s 1,101 cases came out of 84,237 tests — 52,099 RT-PCR and 32,138 Rapid Antigen — conducted over the past 24 hours, officials in the state health department said, adding that the positivity rate had gone up to 1.31%. Four fresh fatalities were recorded in the last 24 hours taking the death toll to 10,967, while the total tally of cases reached over 6.49 lakh. The Covid-19 caseload in Delhi on January 1 stood at over 6.25 lakh. The number of daily cases had started to come down in February. The month’s highest daily count of 256 cases was recorded on February 26. However, since March 1, cases in the capital have been rising steadily. Delhi has recorded 10,684 cases in the last 23 days with a daily average of 465. The city had registered 888 cases on Monday, 823 on Sunday, 813 on Saturday, 716 on Friday, 607 on Thursday, 536 on Wednesday and 425 on Tuesday, according to official data. A senior doctor at Lok Nayak Hospital said, “There has been a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases over the past week. A similar trend was observed in states like Maharashtra and Punjab recently. Complacency and non-adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour is responsible for this, but we cannot rule out the possibility of the spread of mutated strains of the novel coronavirus as yet.” The hospital has treated over two dozen cases of the UK variant of the viral infection. Recently, it confirmed the presence of the South Africa variant in a 33-year-old man, a resident of Kerala, with a history of travel to the country. A doctor at BLK Superspecialty Hospital said the demand for hospital beds had also gone up in the last few days. The hospital, situated in central Delhi, has 70 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients of which 61% were occupied on Tuesday, data on Delhi Corona app showed. The occupancy of beds at hospitals like Jaipur Golden, Sir Ganga Ram, Max Shalimar Bagh and Holy Family stood at 82%, 71%, 44% and 44%, respectively. At AIIMS Trauma Centre, 43 patients were admitted. Overall, the data shared on Delhi Corona app showed that 1,030 (18%) of 5,740 Covid-19 beds were occupied across the city. The occupancy of ICU beds with and without ventilator support was 21% each. In addition, there were 2,316 patients under home isolation and 14 undergoing treatment at Covid Health Centres, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/daily-tally-past-1k-for-first-time-this-year/articleshow/81658172.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Bhopal||Ahead of hearing on bail plea in SC, Ram Bai urges hubby to surrender||Bhopal: Two days before hearing in the Supreme Court on the bail plea of her husband, the BSP MLA from Patharia Ram Bai appealed to her husband to surrender. In her appeal on Tuesday she said, being on the run She would have an adverse effect in the Supreme Court hearing in the case on March 26. Talking to a group of reporters in Damoh on Tuesday, BSP MLA Ram Bai said, “I want my husband to surrender.” She said, “I appeal to Thakur saab (Govind Singh) to surrender. Wherever he is, he should surrender or this would have an adverse effect on the March 26 hearing.” Criticising the state government for its failure, the Supreme Court on March 10 ordered for the arrest of Govind Singh, but he continues to elude the state police. A special team of the Special Task Force (STF) has been looking for the fugitive across the country but in vain. Govind is wanted in connection with a March 2019 murder case of Devendra Churasia, a Congress leader. This case dates to March 2019 when Chourasia was murdered by a group of people that allegedly included Govind Singh. After apex court condemnation, the state police stepped up efforts and also announced a reward of Rs 30,000 on information leading to the arrest of Govind Singh that was later hiked to Rs 50,000. Cops also circulated a poster of Govind which mentions16 cases under the IPC under which he was booked. The poster carries phone numbers of Damoh police asking people to provide any information leading to the arrest of the accused and assuring strict confidentiality. The Supreme Court’s observations against the state police came after an additional sessions judge in Damoh hearing the case alleged coercion and conspiracy against him by the district police officials. Somesh Chourasia, son of Devendra Chourasia termed Ram Bai's appeal a "drama". He said, “we have also pleaded with the SC to keep the BSP MLA Ram Bai away from Madhya Pradesh till the trial of the case is over as she would continue to interfere and influence the case.” He said that during the hearing, the DGP of Madhya Pradesh has to submit a compliance report on the arrest of Govind while the SP of Damoh has to submit a reply on the judge’s remark against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/ahead-of-hearing-on-bail-plea-in-sc-ram-bai-urges-hubby-to-surrender/articleshow/81658134.cms||---

The SAD also announced that it would continue to oppose the same when it was presented in Rajya Sabha. SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said the Bill “sought to bring a democratically elected government under a selected appointee of the Union government”. The Akali said now the Lt Governor’s opinion would have to be obtained before taking any executive decision in Delhi. This would negate the ideals of representative governance and democracy, he added. “This is against the federal system of Indian Constitution and could pave the way for more far reaching changes which are not good for diverse country like India,” he said. Cheema said the the Bill came on the heels of abolition of the Jammu and Kashmir state assembly and introduction of three agricultural laws. Even as these Acts have been passed, the draft electricity bill which sought to centralise all power decisions besides seeking to take away the power of state electricity utilities is in the offing, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/passage-of-nct-bill-not-conducive-to-democratic-functioning-sad/articleshow/81666596.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Black Day, Murder Of Democracy’||New Delhi: After the Rajya Sabha passed the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, on Wednesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said it was a sad day for Indian democracy. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia described the step as “dictatorship”. The amendment seeks to give more powers to the lieutenant governor and is likely to lead to confrontation between the elected government and the central government represented by the LG. After the passage of the legislation, Kejriwal tweeted, “RS passes GNCTD Amendment Bill. Sad day for Indian democracy. We will continue our struggle to restore power back to people. Whatever be the obstacles, we will continue doing good work. Work will neither stop nor slow down.” Calling it a black day for democracy, Sisodia tweeted, “The powers of the government elected by the people of Delhi have been snatched away and given to the LG. It is an irony that Parliament, which is the temple of democracy, was chosen for the murder of democracy. The people of Delhi will fight against this dictatorship.” AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha said the amendment is an unconstitutional attempt to make Delhi “administratively impotent”. Delhi government may move the Supreme Court against the amendment. The amended Act specifies that any decision of the state cabinet will need the LG’s “opinion” before implementation. This paves the way for the city-state to become like any other Union territory. The amendment makes the ‘government’ referred to in any law to be made by Delhi assembly to mean the LG. Besides, the assembly or any of its committee cannot conduct inquiries on administrative decisions and provides a shield to bureaucrats who are often summoned to the assembly or its committees over administrative decisions. The amendment makes it necessary for Delhi government to obtain the opinion of the LG before taking any executive action under any law. A government official opined that this greatly empowers the LG, who can now review all the decisions of the elected government and give his suggestions or object to the decisions. According to sources, some decisions of the elected government may be affected now. The Bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha soon after the state government changed Delhi’s excise policy and tweaked the doorstep delivery of ration scheme to remove its nomenclature. AAP has slammed BJP for passing the legislation, saying it was designed to cripple the elected government and give undue powers to the LG, who represents the central government. Kejriwal had earlier called the move as unconstitutional and anti-democracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/black-day-murder-of-democracy/articleshow/81676990.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Chennai||Why is everyone silent about engaging kids in election campaigns?||Chennai: Statutory bodies, police and election commission are all quiet when it comes to taking action for engaging children in poll-related activities.With schools being shut due to Covid, parties are picking more children to add to the colour and energy of their poll campaign this year. Children as young as 10 are made to play kettle drums and other instruments or dance at election rallies, holding banners and distributing pamphlets.Politicians, who use these children, teach them to say that they have joined election campaigns with their parents’ consent, but in reality the kids are just seen as a cheaper option. For instance, roping in a dance troupe or music band costs around `1,000 or more. But organisers pay `200 or `300 to the children, who see it as a big amount, says S Chandrasekar, a child rights’ activist."Also kids see it as play, they don’t get tired soon or complain much. Most of them are from economically weaker sections or socially backward communities," he says.This is nothing short of child labour, says advocate R Karunanidhi. According to the new Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, even if children, who are aged above 16, are sent to work with their parents’ consent it is considered an offence. So exploiting those who are 14 or below is a crime. The act recommends a three-year imprisonment or `1 lakh as penalty for cruelty to a child.Though leading dailies have published photographs confirming rampant violation of the law, the Tamil Nadu State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) has not taken suo moto cognizance of a single incident so far. Speaking to TOI, Saraswathi Rangaswamy, chairperson of SCPCR admitted this and agreed to act on it soon.Professor Andrew Sesuraj from Loyola Knowledge Hub for Excellence in Child Protection says that usually people tend to get confused between making children more involved in politics and using them for election activities like campaigns. While the former deals with their right to express, listen or about their education or livelihood, the latter is exploitation.Though there could be no major short-term effect, this age is appropriate for observing news or forming ideas. "Getting associated with a particular political party is premature that could change with experiences as they grow up," says psychiatrist Jai Kumar."Moreover. in case they participate in such gatherings without the supervision of their parents there is always a chance of getting exposed to alcohol, substance abuse or even sexual abuse in crowds," he says.D Saravanan, a government school teacher from Madurai says, "Once these children get used to receiving money, there is always a chance of them not returning to school the next year. Already, the list of long absentees in government schools for online classes is on the rise. So such a trend could worsen dropout rates next year."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/why-is-everyone-silent-about-engaging-kids-in-election-campaigns/articleshow/81657150.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Delhi||Taste and buy liquor at five premium vends in Delhi||NEW DELHI: A day after Delhi government announced its decision to exit the liquor retail business, analysis shows that the city would be divided into 32 zones for equitable distribution of shops. The current liquor stores would be reshuffled and distributed evenly across Delhi. In a first, people would be able to buy liquor after tasting it at five super-premium retail vends proposed by the government. These units would have to be created on a minimum 5,000 square feet space. They can set up a tasting room within an enclosed area not visible from the rest of the store. Training and tasting sessions may also be held to educate customers about brands. The super-premium vends would only sell beer priced above Rs 200 and other spirits with retail prices higher than Rs 1,000. They would have at least 100 imported liquor brands and be allowed to dedicate 10% of their space to sell ancillary products such as cigars, liquor chocolates, bar glasses, etc. They would also be allowed to open till 11pm, an hour more than the general vends. There would be 27 private vends in each of the 32 zones, NDMC and Cantonment areas would have one zone of 29 vends and IGI Airport would be considered a special zone with 10 vends. In total, Delhi will have 849 vends. Zonal licences would be issued to allow greater flexibility in allocating vends in areas considered more profitable. To ensure no cartels are formed, no entity would be allocated more than two zones. The carpet area of each vend would be a minimum of 500 square feet and designed to provide walk-in experience. The vend would have closed glass doors, be airconditioned and well lit. Customers would not be allowed to crowd outside or on the pavement and buy through a counter. The allotment of vends would be made through e-tenders and any private legal entity or individual with proof of filing income tax returns for three years would be eligible to participate in the bid. Renewal of licences at the end of the year would depend on complying with the terms and conditions. If a licensee is found engaged in malpractices, their entire zone’s licence would be cancelled and re-tendered. A special team would be set up for quality monitoring and adherence to licensing terms. New bar codes with high-level security features would be implemented to check duplicity. The group of ministers (GoM) headed by deputy CM Manish Sisodia had recommended reduction in excise duty and VAT to curb tax evasion. It also recommended allowing concession, rebate or discount by wholesalers and retailers. Currently, it is illegal to give rebates. Price fixing and brand registration would also become simplified. The number of dry days in a year would be reduced from 25 to 3 on a par with Haryana and Punjab. However, there is no clarity on how these moves would impact prices. The GoM had recommended that the retail margin should be fixed by market forces and not the government. The low retail margin fixed by the government encouraged various malpractices, including commission for brand pushing and sale of non-duty paid liquor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/taste-and-buy-liquor-at-5-premium-vends/articleshow/81658154.cms||AlokKNMishra

He took pot shots at chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami for criticising him for using helicopters to travel during poll campaign. He said those criticising him are the same people who took the aerial route during Gaja cyclone when he was on the ground helping families affected by the cyclone.“They used government money to travel in helicopter, but they could not digest my helicopter travel using my money so that I reach campaign site on time,” he said.

As a part of this series, a unique talent hunt of Urdu shayars has been organised in the state capital by the department of culture and Urdu Academy, MP. The two-day event which began at Kukkut Bhavan, near MANIT square in the city, saw over 50 participants, competing for the top laurels. “Our first talent hunt was based on prose, which was very well-received. The idea behind this event is to discover fresh talent and a new breed of Urdu shayars who can address various issues and touch people’s hearts with the power of their kalaam,” said celebrated shayara and director of Urdu Academy, Nusrat Mehdi. ‘Due to Covid, we had to extend the event to two days so that participants could be accommodated as per Covid norms.

We were immensely impressed with the kind of literary inputs given by all the shayars, who had come from Ujjain, Dewas, Gwalior, Sehore, Bhind and many other parts of MP, along with the state capital,” said the director. Abhay Shukla’s kalaam impressed the judges and won him the top slot too. In the second session, patriotic songs as well as Sufi kalaams were rendered by Saleem Allah Wale and his group, which were appreciated a lot by the audience. On March 24 too, the talent hunt would continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/youngsters-nail-day-1-of-talash-e-jauhar/articleshow/81658143.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi

According to police, the boy confessed to killing his sister and surrendered before them. Earlier, the suspect’s age was not clear but after examining his educational documents, police dropped him at his house and will produce him before the juvenile board on Wednesday. The teenager told police that he advised his sister several times to stay away from the boy but she was not ready to listen. On Tuesday, the brother-sister had another argument over the issue. Later, he called her to the rear side of their house, and after a brief argument, he allegedly hacked her to death with an axe. Talking with TOI, SP, Farrukhabad, AK Meena, said that the girl’s body has been sent for post-mortem. The legal formalities are under process and an FIR will be registered soon at Kamalganj police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/girl-15-hacked-to-death-by-brother-17-in-farrukhabad/articleshow/81657183.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Sources said that the employees of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) tested positive in phases over the last two weeks. Vadodara airport director T K Gupta is undergoing treatment at a hospital after testing positive of Covid-19. A majority of other staff members are under home isolation while a couple of them are hospitalised. Gupta told TOI that he is recovering. “I am hospitalised for the last couple of days. I am feeling much better and I have almost recovered,” he said. Gupta said that the staff testing positive has not affected operations of Vadodara airport that handles 11 flights and over 1,000 passengers every day. “It is not that everybody caught the infection in a day. The staff slowly caught the infection. We have staggered our manpower in various groups so that work does not get affected,” he said. It is worth mentioning here that Vadodara airport officials had approached the state authorities requesting them to vaccinate airport staff. In November last year, Gupta had shared a list of AAI staff at the airport who should be considered for vaccination. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) staff which has been deployed at the airport has been vaccinated. But other staff including AAI employees and staff of the airlines are yet to get vaccinated. “We have requested the state authorities and the health officials here to at least vaccinate the critical staff on a priority basis,” said Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-airport-director-nine-aai-staff-infected/articleshow/81656251.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Manohar Lal Khattar’s confidant from RSS is new HSSC chairman||CHANDIGARH: In the face of criticism over frequent cancellation of recruitments, scrapping of certain examinations and allegations of corruption, the Haryana government on Tuesday revamped the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC). Senior RSS leader Bhopal Singh and a confidant of Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, will now be the chairman of HSSC. He was a member in the earlier panel. With this, the innings of two-time HSSC chairperson Bharat Bhushan Bharti has finally come to an end. While sources cited the controversy-ridden tenure of the Bharti-led commission as the reason for the revamp, officials in CMO maintained that the selection had been made following the recommendation of a select committee headed by parliamentary affairs and education minister Kanwar Pal Gujjar. The five members appointed to the commission are Kanwaljit Singh Saini, a resident of New Chandigarh who hails from Yamunanangar district, Vijay Kumar from Charkhi Dadri district, Satyawan Shera of Untala village of Panipat, Vikas Dahiya of Ratangarh village of Sonipat district and Sachin Jain from Ganga Bagh area of Hisar district, Bhopal Singh, who belongs to a farmer’s family in Khadri village of Yamunanagar, has been associated with RSS for long. Apart from being a law graduate, Singh also has a master’s degree in eight subjects. Speaking to a section of media after his elevation, Bhopal Singh said he would uphold the dignity of the commission and ensure transparent and merit-based recruitment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rss-man-and-khattar-loyalist-to-head-hssc/articleshow/81658148.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Kolkata||Covid-19: Kolkata hospitals gear up for rush of 45+ group||KOLKATA: Private hospitals across Kolkata are set to have separate counters for recipients of 45-plus age group — who will be inoculated from Aril 1 — and some may deploy additional manpower to handle the rush, which is expected during the first fortnight as the new group makes a dash for the jab. Most hospitals said they were planning to divert the resources that are now being used for the second dose of health workers, which will be over by March 31, to the 45-plus age group. AMRI Hospitals will employ additional staff to handle the additional load. It plans to vaccinate around 500 at each of its three units. Around 80% of the recipients could be 45 plus. “This is indeed a great move and will go a long way in checking the transmission of Covid. The 45-plus age group comprises the working population. They travel in public transport, which makes them susceptible to the virus. If we can protect this group, Covid will be restricted. We are ready to further step up the number of recipients since the government has said that there will be no dearth in the supply of vaccines,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) has planned to use one of its vaccination centres, which is now being used for the second dose of health workers, for the 45-plus recipients. “While there will be a dedicated counter for the new group, we expect a huge rush initially, like what had happened when the 60-plus group was inducted. So, in case one counter is not enough, we will divert some of the recipients to the 60-plus window that is now less crowded,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. Medica Superspecialty Hospital is looking at ‘streamlining’ its vaccination process to handle the imminent rush. “There will be a scamper and it will be a challenge. We might have to involve more people to get things moving smoothly. But since the new group is a younger one, it should be faster and easier to handle than the 60-plus group. Depending on the rush, we might have to allocate extra space,” said chairperson Alok Roy. Peerless Hospital, too, expects a huge rush during the first fortnight of April. It has planned an additional space for the new recipients. “With the new entrants, vaccination counters will again be clogged. The 45-plus group is younger and mobile, unlike the senior citizens and they will try and get the jab as early as possible. Since this is a working group, they will be keen to get the vaccine sooner rather than later,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Doctors said this was a major step towards wiping out Covid and the focus should now be on vaccinating as many as possible within the quickest possible time. “So far, we have covered a miniscule part of the population. But now, the younger population will be covered. The aim should be to vaccinate them quickly. The government should also think about making the vaccine freely available at a price so that it can be taken everywhere rather than just a handful of hospitals,” said CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosps-gear-up-for-rush-of-45-group/articleshow/81657180.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

They have been booked under provisions of the Immoral Trafficking Act, 1956 and sent to jail. A hunt is on for the owner who fled the scene at the time of the raid. Giving details, Anil Yadav, additional superintendent of police (ASP), Moradabad, said, “For the past several days, police had been receiving complaints relating to illegal activities being carried out in the spa. Ajay Pal Singh, in charge of Special Operations Group, visited the spa as a decoy customer and asked about the services being provided. After he gathered information about the racket, a raid was conducted on the spa.” He added, “Three people were caught red-handed soliciting customers. Two women -- one from Hapur and the other from Gautambudh Nagar -- were also found to be involved in the racket. Those arrested were identified as Bharat Rajkumar of Agra, Asim of Majhola, Moradabad, Shaqib of Civil Lines, Rampur and spa receptionist Ravi Kumar of Moradabad. Spa owner, Satish Chaudhary, is absconding The women alleged that the spa owner contacted them offering a job at a salon. On arrival, they were offered Rs 17,000 per month and forced into the sex racket by him, they claimed. The ASP added, “A case has been registered against the accused under provisions of the Immoral Trafficking (Prevention) Act, 1956.” Further investigation is on, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/sex-racket-busted-in-moradabad-4-held/articleshow/81654194.cms||Maria Khan
---||Dehradun||CAT judge recuses himself from whistleblower IFS officer Sanjeev Chaturvedi’s plea||NAINITAL: Justice RN Singh, a judge of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), recused himself from hearing whistleblower IFS officer Sanjeev Chaturvedi’s plea against the lateral entry of private professionals into Central government at the rank of joint secretaries. The order was reserved on February 17 and delivered on March 11. This comes after Chaturvedi had moved an application before the bench, contending that Singh had appeared against him for the Centre or the Central Vigilance Commission in a case before the CAT earlier. As Singh became the eight judge in eight years to recuse himself from or relegate cases filed by Chaturvedi, there is no judicial member left at the tribunal’s principal bench in Delhi to hear Chaturvedi’s case. The tribunal has only two judicial members in Delhi – its chairman L Narsimha Reddy and Justice Singh – both of whom have recused themselves from the case. According to the CAT Act, the bench hearing a case has to have one administrative and one judicial member. According to records, the CAT bench had noted the name of Justice RN Singh on at least four occasions, including in its final orders. Chaturvedi, therefore, asked the bench, comprising AK Bishnoi as an administrative member, to remit the case back to the Nainital bench in “the interest of justice and fair play”. The CAT order says that the bench has no “vested interest” in hearing this matter and therefore directed the case to be placed before chairman Reddy for necessary orders. However, the order says, “Justice Singh remembers that he has not represented any of the respondents in the cases cited by Chaturvedi. From the orders placed on record by Chaturvedi, it transpires that his relative counsels, practising from the same chamber, have been the counsel for some respondents in these matters and he might have appeared for them and/or with them.” “Be that as it may, without going into the merit of the request on behalf of the applicant for recusal of one of us (R N Singh, member (J)) from the present matter, one of us (R N Singh, member (J), recuses himself to hear the instant matter,” the order adds. As reported by TOI earlier, Chaturvedi had filed an original application (OA) before the Nainital bench of CAT against the lateral entry scheme. However, after the Centre filed a transfer petition before the tribunal’s principal bench, the case was transferred to Delhi. After Chaturvedi challenged the transfer, the HC issued notices to the CAT chairman, the Centre as well as other respondents in the case. Sudershan Goel, the counsel appearing for Chaturvedi, said the bench’s claims are not true. “His (Justice Singh’s) appearance is recorded on at least four occasions and even in final orders. Further, one of the judicial orders even records that another counsel, Anmol Pandita, appeared on his behalf, which further contradicts the bench’s claims. Now this spree of bench hunting must stop and Nainital bench must be allowed to resume hearing without any further delay,” Goel said. Chaturvedi currently serves as the Chief Administrator of Forest (Research) Haldwani. He has investigated and reported several corruption cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cat-judge-recuses-himself-from-whistleblower-ifs-officer-sanjeev-chaturvedis-plea/articleshow/81657189.cms||Prashant Jha

A Punjab school education department spokesperson said here on Tuesday that the director of education had written to all affiliate private schools of the CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education), CISCE (Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations), and Punjab School Education Board, telling them to protect the interests of students. The spokesperson said some private schools forced their students to buy books and uniform from favoured shops that overcharged them.

---||Kolkata||Covid cases after first jab worry doctors||KOLKATA: Scores of people have contracted Covid-19 infection after they received the first dose of vaccine and this triggered concerns among doctors about those dropping their guards immediately after the inoculation. At least 10 such patients are now admitted in two south Kolkata private hospitals while several others are undergoing treatment in various hospitals off EM Bypass. Some others are in home isolation with mild symptoms. It may take up to three weeks after the second dose for immunity to reach a level that can ward off Covid, said doctors. Four out of 18 Covid patients admitted at CMRI Hospital had the disease after they had their first dose of inoculation. While some of them might have been lax about preventive measures, others were probably unlucky to get the infection since it takes about three weeks to develop 60%-65% resistance to Covid after the first shot, according CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology, Raja Dhar. They might have been infected before they got the shot, Dhar said. “While it is difficult to say how they got infected, it’s important to remember that one can’t afford to ignore safety precautions even after the second dose. You get around 80% protection after the second dose, which means that many will still remain prone to the virus,” said Dhar. Around seven or eight patients have tested positive for the virus at Belle Vue Clinic after they got their first dose. All had relatively mild infection, though, according to Belle Vue internal medicine consultant, Rahul Jain. “Most of them had been careless and joined gatherings and parties without masks. They believed that they were safe and paid the price. So, we are now asking everyone, including those who have got the first shot, to stick to the Covid protection protocols till at least three weeks after the second dose,” said Jain. At Peerless Hospital, too, several patients have been treated for Covid after they received their first dose. “They had mild infections and did not require hospitalization. But it shows that vaccine recipients are careless at a time when the number of Covid cases has started going up. We have had three or four admissions every day this week and the number of Covid patients has touched 22,” said Peerless Hospital CEO, Sudipta Mitra. In February-end, a patient got admitted to RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) with fever, days after getting the vaccine. He tested positive and was discharged last Saturday. “We have another patient who tested positive after taking the first dose two weeks ago. He is being treated at home under the supervision of our doctor,” said RTIICS zonal head, R Venkatesh. AMRI Hospital, too had a patient testing positive after the vaccine. “But it was a mild infection and the patient recovered very quickly,” said AMRI CEO, Rupak Barua. Vaccines were being taken to be a fool-proof protection and a license to join gatherings, said doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-cases-after-first-jabs-worry-doctors/articleshow/81657190.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

All other MLAs have been advised to get themselves tested and report to the assembly secretariat if they have any symptoms. These MLAs met other ministers, the speaker, other MLAs and staffers over the past few days. Officials fear that before the end of the budget session, more MLAs will test positive for Covid-19.

---||Agra||FIR ordered against Etah cops, who ‘framed’ 10 people after argument over bill at eatery; probe shifted to Aligarh||AGRA: Police in UP’s Etah district on Tuesday ordered an FIR against its three personnel, including an already suspended station house officer (SHO), after an initial inquiry substantiated the allegation that they had refused to pay bill at an eatery and framed 10 people, including the eatery owner’s kin and eight customers, in a false case of loot after an argument with them. Local police had also claimed that they were held after an "encounter". The 10 people, including the eatery owner’s brother, cousin and eight customers, are in jail since February 4. ADG Rajeev Krishna had taken strict cognizance of the matter. After initial investigation conducted by the district’s additional superintendent of police (crime) Rahul Kumar, the ADG ordered suspension of constables Santosh Kumar and Shailendra Kumar. The two policemen were involved in the initial squabble over payment of bills at the eatery after which additional force was called and the ten people were arrested and sent to jail. The ADG ordered an FIR against the two constables and SHO (under suspension) Indreshapal Singh. The probe was also transferred to Aligarh district. SHO Singh is already under suspension and facing a probe in a separate case of corruption. ADG Krishna told TOI, “Following the initial investigation, it came to the fore that the allegations made by the ‘dhaba’ owner were indeed correct. I have ordered the suspension of the two constables. An FIR will be registered against them under the relevant sections. The entire matter will be investigated by a senior officer of Aligarh district. We will ensure suitable legal and departmental action against the guilty policemen. Names of a few other people have surfaced in the entire matter. They too, will not be spared.” The eatery owner, Praveen Kumar Yadav, alleged that on March 4, the two constables had refused to pay Rs 400 bill after eating food. “They were offering only Rs 80. My elder brother requested them to pay at least Rs 200. Some of the customers also asked them to pay the bill. Following an argument, the policemen started beating my brother. They were drunk and threatened to send us to jail.” Yadav said that after the argument, constables left the eatery at Agra Road. “Soon, 15 policemen arrived and took my brother and cousin along with eight costumers to Kotwali Dehat police station and registered an FIR against them.” In the FIR, they alleged that the 10 people were part of an organized gang and were hatching a plan for loot. Police also claimed that they were held following an encounter. In the recovery, local police showed six illegal weapons, 80-litre illicit liquor and 2kg contraband. And that the "gang" had fired 6 rounds. According to sources, the SHO had shown fake recovery from the innocent men in connivance with liquor mafia Bantu Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/fir-ordered-against-etah-cops-who-framed-10-people-after-argument-over-bill-at-eatery-probe-shifted-to-aligarh/articleshow/81657206.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Kolkata||Norm breach undoes good work as Kol fresh cases stay in three digits for 4th straight day||Kolkata: New Covid-19 cases in Kolkata breached the three-digit figure for four days in succession after a two-month hiatus, sparking concerns among health experts and frontline health workers. The latter believe that the new case count will now rise for at least the next three-four weeks and could then stabilize and dip. “So this is a crucial phase now and a lot will depend on how we tackle the situation. It’s important to stick to all the protection norms that have been ignored over the last two months. Most importantly, vaccination needs to be stepped up so that we can inoculate as many as possible,” said CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. Cases in the city that had been confined to two digits since January 20 and had witnessed a steady decline before beginning to rise again in recent weeks. With elections round the corner and political parties mobilizing mass meetings and rallies, doctors fear the absence of distancing norms will spark a surge in cases, driving the city into the second wave. “We have seen a dangerous relaxation of distancing norms that has contributed to the present surge in new cases. Wedding parties have resumed and so have private parties where masks are seldom used. These are organized in sealed, air-conditioned halls where the release of aerosol is higher and so is the risk of transmission. We need to revive the strict norms that were followed at the beginning of the pandemic and there should be no tolerance to violations. Masks should be compulsory everywhere,” said Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. On March 20, the city had recorded 125 new cases, one death and 1,336 active cases. The next day, 158 new cases were reported but there were no deaths. The active case count increased to 1,336. The following day, 128 new cases were reported. There was one death and the 1,427 active cases in the city. On Tuesday, there were 153 new cases, one death and 1,471 active cases in Kolkata. The last time the new Covid case count had breached the three figure mark was on June 2, 2020, when 116 cases were reported. Though it had again dipped to 99 the next day, and 94 on June 4, the new case count hit 101 on June 5 and remained in three digits till January 20 when it had dipped to 89 new cases. Most Kolkata hospitals have seen a steady rise in the number of Covid patients over the last 10 days. “We have seen three-four admissions a day since Thursday. This is significant and if the current rate of admission continues then we may have to re-convert some non-Covid beds,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, the number of Covid patients has gone up from 10 last week to 15 now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/norm-breach-undoes-good-work-as-kol-fresh-cases-stay-in-three-digits-for-4th-straight-day/articleshow/81657212.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

This could lead to a sudden rush in proposals in the next few days, said sources in the education department. The state government had last year directed all private schools to cut annual school fees by 25% for the 2020-2021 academic year. The move was aimed at benefiting more than 30 lakh parents of schoolgoing children at 20,000 schools who have been hit by the economic slowdown caused by the Covid pandemic and the lockdown situation. Parents who have already paid the entire year’s fees were entitled to a refund. The FRC guidelines puts a cap on school fees. While for primary level it is Rs 15,000, for secondary and higher secondary it has been fixed at Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000 respectively. For schools seeking higher fees than the limit prescribed, they are to approach the fee revision committee for necessary approval. Even schools that do not want to revise their fees, are to submit a proposal to the FRC giving details for the academic year 2021-22, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/private-schools-to-submit-fee-proposal-before-frc-by-march-31/articleshow/81658210.cms||---
---||Agra||Covid protocols go for a toss as 5 lakh gather for Mathura's Lathmar Holi||AGRA: With barely any face masks and no social distancing in place, nearly 5 lakh people gathered at Barsana town, about 25 km from Mathura, to mark Lathmar Holi on Tuesday. For the first time, the state government had funded the event, which saw 1 lakh more people turn up than at last year’s celebrations. “In 2020, about 4 lakh people had turned up, a lot less than this year’s 5 lakh,” local intelligence unit inspector Pradeep Sharma said. Last year, this was around the time the pandemic was hitting the country and protocols were just being laid out to control the spread of the virus. This year, just as UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced tighter Covid-19 norms amid rising cases in the state, the Lathmar Holi celebrations were taken a notch higher. “For the first time, the state government released Rs 60 lakh to organise it on a grand scale and boost tourism. The event has been included in the state calendar,” a district official said. “Earlier, the event would be organised by the administration at a local level.” To manage the crowds, district authorities said, they had put protocols in place. “Ten medical teams were deputed at the four major points of entry where health officials and police personnel were present for thermal screening. Masks were also distributed. We advised each person to follow Covid-19 guidelines. Throughout the event, we kept announcing that people should keep their masks on,” district magistrate Navneet Singh Chahal said. Once inside, however, masks and caution were abandoned as people fell over each other, grabbed one another to smear colours and danced to music. As part of the three-day festival, men from Nandgaon arrive at Barsana, sing provocative songs and try to smear colour on women. The women from Barsana then “ward them off” with sticks, in a symbolic callback to the Radha-Krishna mythology cycle. On Tuesday, besides the lakhs of devotees, those from the administration and police were also seen not wearing masks. The scene was exactly the same as that on Monday, when a precursor to the festival called Laddoo Maar Holi — in which temple workers throw laddoos at devotees — was celebrated. As videos of the celebrations on both days went viral, UP chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tewari ordered a ban on unsanctioned processions and public functions on Tuesday. The order also said organisers have to ensure Covid-19 norms are followed. Besides, those older than 60 or younger than 10, and those suffering from serious ailments would not be allowed to attend. “The health department is on alert but restrictions can only be implemented by the administration,” Covid control room in charge for Mathura, Dr Bhudev, said. DM Chahal added, “People need to be more serious about Covid-19. It is a traditional festival and people have been celebrating for years because of their faith and belief in Lord Krishna. Health officials and police did everything they could.” (Photo credit: Anil Agarwal)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/covid-protocols-go-for-a-toss-as-5-lakh-gather-for-mathuras-lathmar-holi/articleshow/81657225.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The administration of Metro Hospital came to know of the theft of two ventilators on Monday when they opened the bio-medical room on the ground floor after more than a month. The hospital has been undergoing renovation since January 5 due to which all equipment have been stored in the bio-medical room. Dr Kamlesh Patel, who works at the hospital, told police that the ventilators were last seen in the bio-medical room on February 8. On Monday when the room was opened the two ventilators worth Rs 7.5 lakh were missing. Police said that the ventilators were purchased in 2008 from Delhi. “We suspect that an insider may have been involved in the theft, but we are still investigating,” said inspector R S Baria of Harni police station. He added that the hospital CCTV cameras were not operational due to the renovation work. No one except the labourers involved in renovation work and hospital’s administrative and maintenance staff had visited the premises since the renovation work started.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ventilators-worth-rs-8l-stolen-from-hospital-under-renovation/articleshow/81656325.cms||---

---||Chennai||Stalin nurses a grudge against me as we shattered his CM dreams: SP Velumani||The man considered to be the third most powerful in the Palaniswami-Panneerselvam dispensation and ‘enemy no.’ for DMK president M K Stalin, S P Velumani, is confident of his party’s work. He rubbishes pre-poll surveys that indicate a defeat for the AIADMK. In an interview to V Mayilvaganan, the minister said the AIADMK alliance would win more than 200 seats and recalled how in 2016 too, all pre-poll surveys had predicted the alliance’s loss.Q: How is the ground situation in Thondamuthur?Thondamuthur is always a fort of the AIADMK. We have done numerous development work here. Each and every family here would support me. Not just in Thondamuthur, we will win all the constituencies in Coimbatore district. Q: What about other parts of the state?We are in power for 10 years. EPS is CM for four years, giving a wonderful rule. He has brought 7.5% quota for government students in MBBS, bank loan waiver, Cauvery delta protected zone, brought industrial investment despite Covid. So, people like him. There is overwhelming support for these measures. He would certainly become the chief minister again. Q: Pre-poll surveys predict a victory for the DMK. Your reaction?In 2016, no surveys predicted that the AIADMK would win again. All said the DMK will win. But eventually Amma won. The same thing will happen again. We will win and EPS will be the CM. Q: How many seats will the AIADMK alliance win?We will certainly win more than 200 seats Q: EPS formed a grand alliance in 2019. But the DMDK, Puthiya Tamizhagam, Samathuva Makkal Katchi, Karunas and Thamimun Ansari have left the alliance. Why couldn’t EPS keep the alliance intact?We did not sideline anyone. Each party has a certain percentage of vote share and seats are allocated based on that. There were discussions to finalise seats. We were speaking to our allies one after another. But they were in a hurry and left the alliance. Some went to the media even as discussions were happening, which was not right. Q: Do you think their departure would affect the AIADMK?Not at all. It is a loss only to the parties that left us. Q: What are the challenges faced by the AIADMK in the electoral battle?Covid was a challenge. There are no other challenges. Q: Do you feel the AIADMK would lose minority votes this time because of alliance with the BJP?The CM has clarified that there is a stark difference between political alliances and the policies of our party. After Amma, it was EPS who implemented a number of welfare measures for minorities. We have even said in the poll manifesto that we will urge the Centre to drop the CAA. Minorities are well aware of these facts and that the AIADMK is the only party that supports them. At the same time, people also know it was Stalin who uses religion for electoral benefits. The DMK used to hurt religious sentiments of Hindus, but during an election, Stalin poses with a ‘vel’. Q: But there are speculations that the AIADMK will not be able to taste victory in west Tamil Nadu like it did in 2016?Not just in the west, even in the north and south we will win with a massive mandate. Q: DMK president M K Stalin specifically targets you. Why do you think he does that?I have been a minister since 2011. But Stalin started attacking me only from 2017. Because in 2017, he wanted to topple the EPS-led AIADMK government. But power minister P Thangamani, EPS, OPS and I, stood together and we prevented that. In fact, we convinced 10 DMK MLAs to back us during that time. Stalin knows that. That’s why he nurses a grudge against me, that we prevented him from becoming CM. Q: He is saying Velumani will be the first to go to jail after the DMK comes to power.When he campaigned in Coimbatore recently, he uttered my name 134 times. When he campaigns, he ought to seek votes for his candidates. Instead he is obsessed with me, he keeps thinking about me round the clock. As I said, it’s because we shattered his chief ministerial dreams. Q: Corruption charges are repeatedly thrown at you.All those are baseless charges. Their strategy is to go to the media with a baseless allegation, lodge a complaint with the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption and then go to court. But there will be no evidence submitted for those charges anywhere. Stalin has no right to talk about corruption. Thirteen former DMK ministers are facing court cases. Q: There are allegations that political parties are pushing TN towards deeper debt with freebies. Your view?We borrow not just for freebies, but to create assets. We borrowed for the Metro rail project and created the asset that will be there forever. Other states have much higher debts, while TN’s debt remains low.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/stalin-nurses-a-grudge-against-me-as-we-shattered-his-cm-dreams/articleshow/81657222.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Owaisi’s AIMIM plans to contest civic polls in MP||BHOPAL: The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul-Muslimeen (AIMIM), led by Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, has opened a party office in Bhopal and started online membership drive through a mobile app to enter Madhya Pradesh politics with a foray in local body elections, which are likely to be held soon. Owaisi’s entry into the saffron citadel has sparked a political debate with BJP alleging that only nationalism will prevail in the state and not separatism. AIMIM decided to contest the upcoming elections in MP in November last year after the party got itself registered with the MP State Election Commission as a first step. Amid speculations to enter the elections, the party had also conducted survey in the Muslim-dominated areas of the state capital and has continued to explore possibility in other cities such as Indore and Ujjain. Recently, the party started a membership drive from its district office in Budhwara in the state capital and launched a mobile app to connect youths with the party and its ideology. “Muslims have been considered as vote banks since the last 70 years in the country. None of the political parties paid attention to the basic problems of the community,” said AIMIM district head Tahir Anwar. Anwar said, “AIMIM is expanding its base in MP and has launched a membership drive this week. We are also organising virtual meetings in minority-dominated areas to connect with youths. We will surely contest the upcoming civic polls.” AIMIM’s planned entry in the saffron stronghold has sparked political debate among the national parties who claim to safeguard the minority community. Ruling BJP said the new party would not be able create any impact in the state. “AIMIM is an offshoot of Congress, who had been playing appeasement politics without much success. The public of the state supports nationalism and not separatism. Owaisi has nothing to offer in MP. I urge him to remain in Hyderabad for the sake of national interest,” said BJP Huzur MLA Rameshwar Sharma. Even Congress leaders believe AIMIM will not make an impact in the state. “AIMIM is a protege of BJP. It is known as a ‘vote katwa’ party whom BJP will field against Congress. But MP is known for its bipolar contest and no third player ever succeeded here in the name of minority appeasement,” said Congress state spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/owaisis-aimim-plans-to-contest-civic-polls-in-mp/articleshow/81658174.cms||Rajendra Sharma
---||Delhi||AAP, BJP in war of words over drinking age||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Tuesday said that if Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta makes the minimum age of buying liquor in BJP-led states 25 years, then the Arvind Kejriwal government will make it 30 years in Delhi. The AAP MLA was reacting to the remarks of Gupta on the recent decision of Delhi government to lower drinking age in the capital from 25 years to 21 years, in which he said the AAP government was pushing Delhi’s youth towards liquor. “By our decision, this malpractice will be stopped and that is why BJP is upset,” Bharadwaj said. In a press conference, the AAP member said that the legal age of drinking alcohol in BJP-led states like Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh is 21 years — and in Goa it’s 18 years. He said that BJP is saying all these to protect black markets and financial misappropriations. “Earlier, cops used to extort money from restaurant and pub owners for serving liquor to those below 25 years. Now, this money will stop. The BJP members should ask the Centre to make a law that the age of drinking alcohol in the whole country should be 25 years, this will bring uniformity,” Bharadwaj said. Meanwhile, BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the AAP government’s decision to exit the liquor business and allow private players to fill the vacuum was taken at the behest of the liquor mafia. He added that lowering drinking age is morally wrong.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-bjp-in-war-of-words-over-drinking-age/articleshow/81658241.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Meerut||Due worth Rs 11k crore pending, UP cane farmers struggle to meet expenses||Bijnor: Sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh stare at an impending financial crisis as mills have been able to pay only 54% of the dues to farmers in the current harvest season. Many of them said they find it hard to pay power bills and school fees. While the crushing season is still on, mills have still to pay Rs 11,000 crore of the cane crushed so far. According to statistics provided by the cane department, there are around 40 lakh sugarcane growers in Uttar Pradesh who have sold their crop to 120 sugar mills. Out of these, there are three government-run mills, 24 run by the cooperative societies and 93 mills from the private sector. There is a provision that states that the mills should pay sugarcane farmers within 14 days of purchasing sugarcane. Till date, farmers have supplied sugarcane crops worth Rs 26,906 crore to the mills. Out of which, outstanding dues of Rs 24,376 crore is more than 14 days old. Mills have paid Rs 13,334 crore to the farmers for the current crushing season, which is 54.7% of the total dues. Apart from this, dues of Rs 11,041 crore are still pending. According to the sources, the government-run mills and those run by the cooperatives are particularly laggard. They have paid only 27-29% % of their total dues. According to a senior cane official, who did not wish to be named, “All sugar mills have been instructed to pay the farmers in time. The government is doing its best to resolve the issue of pending cane arrears and clear outstanding dues.” For the 2019-2020 crushing season, cane dues worth Rs 35,000 crore were cleared against procurement of sugarcane worth Rs 35,989 crore. Farmers, on the other hand, say timely payment is crucial to them in many ways. Jaswant Singh, a cane farmer in Rambagh Gher, said, “Holi is approaching. Farmers are empty handed and mills are showing no interest to clear our dues. In such a situation, farmers are compelled to sell their remaining cane to kolluhs at Rs 260 per quintal against the state advised price of Rs 325 per quintal.” Satyaveer, another sugarcane grower from Amroha, said, “The SAP has not been revised in the last three years. On the other hand, the cost of production has jumped many fold as power tariff, prices of fertilizers, pesticide, labourer cost and diesel have increased. It is the time when both sugarcane harvesting and sowing is in full swing and farmers need money. But the mills pay us just enough to survive. New education session is about to begin and we have to pay the school fees of our children.” Azad Kisan Union national president Rajendra Singh, said, “We will meet the district administration for early payment of our dues or we will be forced to launch an agitation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/due-worth-rs-11k-crore-pending-up-cane-farmers-struggle-to-meet-expenses/articleshow/81657243.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC orders payout to rape survivor||Mumbai: While allowing medical termination of over 20-week pregnancy of a mentally challenged girl, the Bombay high court has directed the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) to immediately process her papers for payment of compensation under the Manodhairya scheme, which provides for financial aid to survivors of rape, child sex abuse and acid attack. A bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale heard a petition by the girl’s mother seeking HC permission for termination of pregnancy as the law does not permit medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) beyond 20 weeks. The girl, who is currently 17 years and two months old, was raped but the pregnancy was only discovered after she missed her periods for four months. “Since the daughter of the petitioner is mentally challenged, the fact about the said rape could not be discovered earlier,” the petition stated, adding that the survivor later divulged how she was “repeatedly sexually assaulted and raped” by the accused. An HC-constituted medical board of Civil Hospital, Ratnagiri, recommended termination on “humanitarian ground as the victim is less than 18 years of age and suffers from mild mental disability.” The mother’s advocate, Karansingh Rajput, said the girl must be compensated under the state’s “victim compensation scheme.” The judges, in their March 22 verdict, said direction for MTP can be issued, “although length of the pregnancy is beyond twenty weeks, because continuance of such pregnancy would result in grave injury to the mental health of the daughter of the petitioner.” They took note that Manodhairya allows upto Rs 10 lakh payment “where victims of rape are mentally challenged and minor” and added that the authorities must take up girl’s case immediately. The judges directed the Civil Hospital to “forthwith” perform MTP. Since the pregnancy was caused due to rape, they directed the feotus’ tissues and blood sample be preserved for DNA and other tests for trial. The state is directed to immediately place the FIR, medical report and other papers, including the girl’s statement, before the DLSA, which in turn will immediately process papers for payment of compensation to the girl. “It shall be ensured that such payments are made at the earliest and without any delay,” the judges concluded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-orders-payout-to-rape-survivor/articleshow/81658970.cms||Rosy Sequeira

During the hearing on an appeal filed by the state government against a single-judge bench’s order of staying the probe panel from submitting the final report, advocate general Kamal Trivedi stated that the inquiry by the commission is over and only the report is to be submitted. “We wanted to give an extension last time, but the commission said nothing doing. The matter is going to come up pursuant to the observation of the Supreme Court and I (the chairman of the commission) would like to see this particular inquiry is over at an early day. I do not want anything beyond March 31,” the law officer submitted. The advocate general submitted this after the high court inquired about the evidentiary value of the report. He said that sometimes the state government does not want to follow the findings. It is not a binding. It is merely assessment of facts. But he added, “We are keen to see the report, to study and take constitutional action.” To this, senior counsel Percy Kavina, who represents the relatives of victims, questioned how the law officer came to know about completion of the inquiry, unless the chairman of the commission told him personally. He also questioned the autonomy of the commission, by pointing out that the state government and the commission was represented by the same law officer. The relatives have expressed apprehension that the commission would submit its report without hearing them. On March 19, the single judge had temporarily stayed the commission from submitting the final report in response to a petition filed by the relatives of the victim of Shrey Hospital fire tragedy. They had complained that the probe panel rejected their request for parting with documents submitted before it by various parties, and that it refused them permission to visit the ICU of the hospital along with a photographer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/shrey-fire-inquiry-over-govt-tells-hc/articleshow/81658220.cms||---

Several city clubs that were mulling over Holi parties have also dropped their plans and are restricting the celebration to a pre-festival musical evening for only members. With Covid-19 cases again on the rise, doctors expressed concern over a spurt in infection if Dol and Holi are played as it involves physical contact in smearing colour. Last year, too, Dol and Holi celebrations were cancelled in the city as it was feared that the festival would trigger a spike in Covid-19 cases. “We have communicated the state health department’s directive to housing societies. We will keep a vigil on the housing societies as resurgence of Covid-19 cases will pose far greater challenges,” said a senior official of the KMC health department. Residents of the prominent housing complexes in the city have agreed to abide by the rules. At Silver Spring, rain dance — a popular Holi event organised by them every year — has been scrapped. Restrictions have been placed on even smearing of abir. “We have cancelled all pre-scheduled Holi programmes except for the community lunch,” said Indranil Chowdhury, secretary of the Silver Spring Residents Association. At South City too, all Holi plans have been dropped. “We had gala celebration plans but with cases on the rise, we have dropped them,” said Manak Daga, president of South City Residents Welfare Association. Clubs, too, will be asked not to hold Holi parties, a KMC official said. Several city clubs that TOI spoke to said they had dropped plans for a Holi party and were instead organising a musical evening prior on Dol-eve. “We have been following Covid protocols and had hoped the cases would reduce by Holi. As the cases are increasing in other cities, it would have been unwise to go ahead with the celebrations. Though we are yet to receive any KMC notice, we are only holding a pre-Holi musical evening, in which only club members will be allowed to participate,” said Calcutta Rowing Club secretary, Chandan Roy Chowdhury. Next door, Lake Club has also decided to follow suit. “The situation is not conducive to hold a Holi party. So a low-key musical evening is all we plan to do this time,” said club secretary, Subrata Guha. Tollygunge Club, on the other hand, will not even host a social function. “Being a sporting club, Holi was never a big event here. But this time, we will do nothing,” said club CEO, Anil Mukerji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-advises-gated-communities-against-holi-gatherings-clubs-drop-celebration-plans/articleshow/81657246.cms||Saikat Ray

Amidst the second wave of Covid infections in the country, brief lockdowns and night curfews have returned to a number of states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. The traders fear, if the cases continue to rise, lockdown may return to Bengal as well and that would hamper their business. “During the lockdown last year, we had written to the Prime Minister, home minister, finance minister and the state chief minister seeking help for the traders who were reeling under financial distress. But we got response from none. We have somehow moved past that period but we cannot afford another round of lockdown due to recklessness of the political leaders,” said Tarak Nath Trivedi, a textile businessman and general secretary of Federation of Traders Organisation of West Bengal. The organisation submitted a memorandum before the election commission requesting them to keep a vigil on the election rallies. “Be it in a road show, door-to-door visit or large meetings, most leaders are not wearing masks. Such large gatherings can spread the infection. But it seems the politicians don’t care about anything else but winning, said Kaushik Chakraborty, an executive committee member. The organisation has threatened that to would go for large scale demonstrations if the commission doesn’t step in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ask-parties-to-follow-cov-protocol-traders-urge-ec/articleshow/81657258.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Bhopal||Prosperous, Atmanirbhar Madhya Pradesh is the goal, says Shivraj Singh Chouhan||BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday said he is committed to creating a glorious, prosperous and developed Madhya Pradesh. Speaking at a function at Minto Hall to mark the completion of one year of office in his fourth term as CM, Chouhan said that everybody should come together to create a new Madhya Pradesh. Everything is being done to ensure that everyone in MP has access to food, clothes, their own house, healthcare, education and employment opportunities, he said Chouhan said MP’s GSDP will exceed Rs 10 lakh crore this fiscal. Efforts are being made to raise the income of people. In a major step towards fulfilling the dream of ‘Atmanirbhar MP’, 1,800 plants will be inaugurated at one go next month, he announced. The CM transferred Rs 1,530 crore to farmers’ accounts as relief and another Rs 340 crore as farmers'’ welfare fund. He also transferred Rs 60 crore to rural vendors. Chouhan said his government is working to better lives and has transferred Rs 1.18 lakh crore to the accounts of beneficiaries across the state so far. Over Rs 25,000 crore was given to farmers from whom the state government had purchased 129 lakh metric tonnes of wheat. The CM virtually inaugurated eight girls’ schools, built by the tribal welfare department at a cost of Rs 219.7 crore, and 77 school buildings and three hostels of school education department built at a cost of over Rs 104.7 crore. Everyone will have to take the initiative at their level to save water, increase plantation, improve cleanliness, ensure dignity of women, stay away from intoxicants and create an ‘Atmanirbhar Madhya Pradesh’, Chouhan said. Under the ‘good governance’ mission, land documents, and caste and income certificates can be obtained over mobile phone, he said, adding that land worth Rs 9,000 crore has been freed from mafia. “The campaign against mafia will continue because as chief minister, it is my duty to ensure that rule of law prevails,” he vowed. Adequate police force is being ensured for this and eligible inspectors will be promoted to DSP, Chouhan said. Jal Jeevan Mission is being implemented to provide tap water to every household and the Ken-Betwa river-link project will change the face of Bundelkhand, the CM said. “When I took oath as chief minister during the tough times of Coronavirus pandemic, late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s poem ‘Haar Nahi Manunga’ gave me inspiration. With the blessings of the Prime Minister and cooperation of officials and people of the state, we have been able to overcome the problem but the virus has not been eliminated yet. So, we must protect ourselves from Coronavirus and there is no better way to do it than wearing masks,” he said Chouhan said his government is committed to the welfare of people and even during the economic crisis brought about by the pandemic, assistance was provided to all vulnerable sections of society. A book ‘Janseva Ke Ek Saal’ was released at the event, which was attended by several ministers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/prosperous-atmanirbhar-mp-is-the-goal-says-shivraj/articleshow/81658232.cms||---

In an order issued on Tuesday, DDMA stated: “Gatherings, congregations and public celebrations during upcoming festivals like Holi, Shab-e-Barat, Navaratri, etc may pose a considerable threat of spread of virus and may cause setback to the appreciable gains made in the suppression of chain of transmission of Covid cases. Considering this, it has been decided that public celebrations and all gatherings/congregations during upcoming festivals should not be allowed in public places.” There is lack of clarity on whether Holi celebrations can be allowed in clubs, hotels, non-official organisations and other similar places. An official said the clarity on it may be provided on Wednesday. In a separate order, DDMA ordered district authorities to conduct random testing of passengers coming from the states where Covid-19 cases are surging, at railway stations, inter-state bus terminals, and other alighting points (for private buses) in Delhi. “After collection of samples, the travellers would be allowed to exit. However, those passengers who are found positive, shall be mandatorily quarantined/isolated at their place of stay or in institutional quarantine, as the case may be for 10 days as per the prescribed protocol.” Chief secretary Vijay Dev, who is the chairperson of the DDMA’s state executive committee, has signed an order regarding the ban on gatherings at public places during the upcoming festivals. “In case any person is found violating these instructions, they will be proceeded against as per the provisions of section 51 to 60 of Disaster Management Act, 2005, Section 188 of IPC and other applicable laws,” the DDMA order stated. Meanwhile, weekly markets, cinema halls, malls, Metro services and religious places have been identified as super spreader areas. Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Khirwar has asked all DMs to intensify surveillance and awareness campaign at these places, besides at those where sero-prevalence has been low.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gatherings-public-celebrations-banned-for-holi-shab-e-barat/articleshow/81658245.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Coimbatore||Pawnbroker held for forging documents||Coimbatore: The Thudiyalur police arrested a pawnbroker on Monday for attempting to cheat a jewellery shop owner by forging land documents. The arrested person has been identified as N Muthukumar, 38, of Rathinapuri in the city. N Ramesh, 52, of VKL Nagar in Thudiyalur, owner of Kajalakshmi Jewellery on Big Bazaar Street, had lodged a complaint with the Thudiyalur police. “Muthukumar had borrowed Rs 75 lakh from Ramesh in 2015. He had handed over two land documents to Ramesh. Value of the properties were about Rs 9.95 lakh. On July 21, 2019, Muthukumar gave a cheque worth Rs 69.74 lakh to Ramesh, who deposited it in a private bank. When the cheque bounced, Ramesh filed a case against Muthukumar,” a police officer said. “Meanwhile, Muthukumar and his family members hatched a conspiracy and lodged a complaint with the Thudiyalur police, claiming that he had lost the two land documents while travelling from Thudiyalur to Vellakinar. He also gave an advertisement in a vernacular daily about the missing documents. Based on the complaint, he received non- traceable certificate from the Thudiyalur police.

The accident occurred around 5:30 am when the women, who were cooks at an 'anganwadi kendra' in Stone Park area under Old Chawni Ganga Malanpur locality, were returning home after work, Gwalior collector Kaushlendra Vikram Singh said. While eight women and the auto-rickshaw driver died on the spot, the others succumbed to their injuries in a hospital, district SP Amit Sanghi said. Passengers travelling in the bus escaped unhurt, a senior official said, adding that the driver of the bus fled the spot leaving behind the vehicle, which has been seized. The bus was on its way to Morena from Gwalior when the accident occurred. The collector said the women were supposed to travel in two auto-rickshaws after they finished cooking food at the Anganwadi, but as one of them developed a snag at the last moment, they had to travel in one auto-rickshaw, which met with the accident. “We are investigating the circumstances of the accident and the exact cause,” the official said. Madhya Pradesh energy minister Pradyumna Singh Tomar reached the spot soon after the accident. No injuries were caused to the bus passengers, he said. The victims were residents of Gole ka Mandir and Jaderua area in Gwalior. Meanwhile, the Regional Transport Officer (RTO) of Gwalior, MPS Chouhan, has been suspended by the state government, an official said. Expressing grief, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced an ex-gratia of Rs four lakh each to the kin of the victims. Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindia of BJP and Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath have expressed condolences.

On Tuesday, the district recorded 146 fresh cases, taking the total number of cases to 57,413. With 89 people getting discharged, the number of active cases rose to 825. Health department officials say there are around 15,000 doses of Covaxin and Covishield available in the district. Considering that between 6,000 and 8,000 people get vaccinated every day, these stocks will run out in two days. The district health officials have asked for fresh stocks from Chennai. However, they expect only 30,000 doses to be sent through the district’s vaccine transport van from Chennai, which would hardly last for 4-5 days. So far, 1.45 lakh people in the district have taken at least their first shot. Officials say at least 18 lakh people have to take both doses for the district to achieve herd immunity. The effect of the impending shortage began showing in the number of people vaccinated on Monday. From March 16 to 20, more than 8,500 people got their jabs every day, but on Monday, only 6,906 people got the jab. However, health department officials insisted that the problem is temporary. “We have not refused any PHC or private hospital fresh doses. We just give them less than what we earlier did because of the short supply,” said an official.Of the 15,000 doses, 5,000 are Covishield doses. Officials are distributing Covaxin doses to more private hospitals including KG, Royal Care and KMCH and government centres including Mettupalayam GH, Bouluvampatti PHC, Dhaliyur PHC and Irugur PHC. Sources say that in several southern districts like Virudhunagar, all primary health centres and private hospitals have already run out of vaccines. “We have called at least three PHCs and two major private hospitals only to be told that they have run out of stock completely,” said a Rajapalayam resident, Harini C.Since the vaccination drive began on January 16, the district was seeing 500 to 700 people get vaccinated daily in the first few weeks. Officials were complaining about the low response to the vaccine and people refusing to get the shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/district-stares-at-shortage-of-vaccine-has-stock-for-2-days/articleshow/81658240.cms||---

While addressing a huge gathering at a college in Mawana area, he attacked the critics of the farmers’ protest. The government has been calling farmers “terrorists, China-Pakistan sympatisers and anti-social”. “People who have been trying to defame the agitation are the most anti-social and anti-national,” he said. He was in Meerut on Tuesday to unveil a statue of Dhan Singh Gurjar, an Indian kotwal who is believed to have led the initial actions against the East India Company during the 1857 revolt. Drawing parallel between pre-Independence era and the present time, he said that companies close to people in power will enslave farmers and we will once again slip into slavery. “If the current situation prevails any longer, our country will once again slip into slavery. People who understand history would know that the East India Company came to our country and enslaved us. A law was passed in Britain and a trading company became the government. We suffered economically, socially and politically,” former CM Akhilesh Yadav said. “If we don't fight against the farm laws and they get implemented, farmers will become slaves to multinational companies the same way as we were enslaved by the East India Company. These laws are meant to strip the farmers off their lands and destroy them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/if-bjp-loses-wb-up-polls-it-wont-implement-farm-laws-akhilesh/articleshow/81657259.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar has been wrongly briefed about Anil Deshmukh: Devendra Fadnavis||MUMBAI: Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar has been wrongly briefed about the movement of state home minister Anil Deshmukh and the party needs to inquire who is responsible for this, said opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday. Addressing a press conference at the state BJP headquarters, Fadnavis said tweets from Pawar’s handle say Deshmukh was home quarantined in Nagpur while the passenger manifest shows he flew by a private jet to Mumbai. “Pawar said the former Mumbai police commissioner’s claims are false as Deshmukh was in hospital from February 1-15 and thereafter till February 27 he was home quarantined and in isolation in Nagpur. But I have documents from the police on Deshmukh’s movement. On February 17, the police manifest (for people provided with Z-category security) says at 3pm he was to be at the Sahyadri state guest house. On February 24 at 11am he was to go to Mantralaya,” said Fadnavis, adding he did not know if Deshmukh really did go where the police manifest said he was to. Referring to police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s letter to the chief minister, he said it has an SMS chat attached as evidence where Singh asks “ACP Patil” what is the date for Waze’s meeting with the home minister and the latter replies it is February-end. “Wrong things were made to be told by Pawar to protect Deshmukh and this has now been exposed. Deshmukh was home quarantined between February 15-27 but he was not in isolation and met several police officers and this can be verified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pawar-has-been-wrongly-briefed-about-hm/articleshow/81657282.cms||---

Questioning the election commission's decision to go ahead with elections despite the country facing the second wave, the petitioners pointed to severe restrictions that had been put in place during Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Muharram and other festivals last year to prevent the spread of the virus. Bengal has 7.3 crore registered voters. The petitioners also cited how many government officials who have been assigned election duty had received only one doze of vaccine and that they would be right in the thick of elections before receiving the second dose. “They will have to discharge their election-related assignments before their body develops resistance to the virus,” petitioners Shamik Bagchi and Noor Islam Seikh pointed out. They have also questioned the process of sanitizing election booths and buses and cars that will be used in the election process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pil-on-ec-silence-over-political-rallies/articleshow/81657265.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

The donor, who had recovered from the contagious disease, had died in an accident a few days ago. According to Dr Ankit Bharat it is the first of its kind surgery where a Covid-19 infected patient’s lungs were transplanted into another victim of the disease whose lungs were irreversibly damaged. “There has been a debate if a Covid-19 patient can be a lung donor. " This transplant has opened gates to many more similar surgeries,” said Dr Bharat, who was born and brought up in Meerut. The team of surgeons conducted the operation at Northwestern Medical Center, Chicago last week. “All the safety measures were taken. It was checked that the donor lung was not damaged. Also, the lung fluid was tested to ensure that the organ was clear of Covid-19 infection. Once the tests came normal, we decided to proceed with the transplant,” said Dr Bharat, who insisted that this shows that the organs of a Covid-19 positive patient can still be used for a transplant. The health worker got infected with Covid-19 in May 2020. And for the last few months he was on a ventilator. According to a report published in the renowned journal The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, the first successful lung transplant of a donor who suffered from Covid-19 was conducted at Universitair Ziekenhuis Leuven in Belgium in December 2020. But, the surgery performed by Dr Bharat was first of its kind because not only did it involve a Covid-19 donor, but the organ receiver was also a patient of the disease. Dr Bharat, an alumnus of St Mary’s Academy in Meerut, and his team were also the first in the US to conduct a double lung transplant on a woman whose lungs were damaged by Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/indian-origin-doctor-leads-surgery-in-the-us-to-transplant-lungs-of-dead-covid-19-patient-in-a-health-worker-on-ventilator/articleshow/81657264.cms||Ishita Bhatia

---||Delhi||New excise policy: Restaurants raise toast to proposals, expect Delhi to become nightlife hub||NEW DELHI: Restaurateurs and diners have hailed the proposed new excise policy of Delhi government as a step in the right direction. The policy recommended by a group of ministers headed by deputy CM Manish Sisodia lowers the drinking age from 25 to 21 years and promotes private participation in operating liquor stores. However, many leading restaurateurs feel that many other new provisions for hotels, restaurants and clubs, if implemented well, would make it one of the most “comprehensive policy reforms”. Rahul Singh, founder and CEO of The Beer Cafe and former president of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), said the measures were exactly the relief being pleaded for by the existing establishments. Rather than separate licences for using open spaces, it would be one licence and the fee would be charged on the square foot area rather than on the number of covers. “Some of the provisions that can revolutionise operations include extending operating hours till 3am, permission to restaurants to buy liquor from retailers instead of just wholesalers, ease of liquor licences, serving bottles on the table than just pegs in glasses, not drain unconsumed alcohol within seven days of opening and selling draught beer for outdoor catering and other outlets to resell or provide as takeaway,” said Singh. Ace mixologist and co-founder of Sidecar Yangdup Lama said, “Setting up a bar or a concept restaurant is the dream of many youngsters. The reason why the restaurant industry sees such a high number of closures is because they realise that preparing good food and drinks comes last, while procuring licences and dealing with authorities takes all the time. Ease of doing business will encourage many skilled and passionate people to enter the industry.” Singh explained that the rules were a cause for concern for restaurateurs as they could have been fined for not meeting the norms. “Other things that will transform the industry are the provision for a liquor licence within 24 hours of applying with just fire NOC as the required document and easy transfer of licences in case of ownership change. This will make it lucrative for more youngsters to enter the industry. With the annual licence fee for an outlet of 1,000 sq feet starting at Rs 5 lakh, there will be more outlets across Delhi than merely a handful in just selected parts of the city,” he added. The proposed policy also makes bar owners like Premjit Kumar feel respected. He said restaurateurs would be able to focus on providing world-class concepts as operations would be smoother. Restaurateur Dinesh Arora of Unplugged Courtyard said from procuring daily licences to serving alcohol in the open, constantly worrying about underage drinking, early closing hours, waiting for excise permissions, lack of options of brands to dealing with multiple authorities, running a standalone outlet has been nothing short of a nightmare. “These policy changes will make Delhi the nightlife hub of the country,” he added. However, a restaurateur said he expected putting the liability of being responsible citizens also on the youngsters than putting the entire onus on restaurants to check underage drinking and be penalised. A private liquor store owner also alleged there were very few checks in place to save smaller liquor vend owners. He said that due to the proposed bidding system, only bigger conglomerates would enter the market and control the availability of brands and their prices. He cited the example of states that had to do away with bidding and such licences as they promoted monopoly in the market. Lama, though, finally sees a ray of hope. “Changes suggested in the proposed policy show an approach of a liberal mindset towards alcohol. It will make it convenient for people driven by passion to open outlets. This also suggests a fruitful future for bars. If Delhi does it well, this will become a blueprint for other states to emulate,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/restaurants-raise-toast-to-proposals-expect-city-to-become-nightlife-hub/articleshow/81658268.cms||Amin Ali

Prices of raw materials, especially pig iron, steel and scrap, have gone up by 30%, the letter said. “The abnormal price rise has sounded the death knell for MSMEs. The government should bring down the prices to the pre-Covid level and constitute a price monitoring committee.” “MSMEs are also burdened by the goods and services tax. MSME products should be brought under the 5% slab and a GST rectification committee should be formed. Possibilities of exempting small and micro industries from GST should also be explored,” Natarajan said. “Foundries and companies making pumps and motors undergo frequent technological upgradation. Due to lack of upgradation, MSME products are not on par with international products. The government should set up a technological training centre and industrial training institutes to produce skilled workers. The industries have been struggling without bank assistance and proper credit flow. The government should provide loan to these industries at 8% interest rate to a period of 15 years. The government should also consider providing either subsidy for electricity or free electricity up to 1,000 units,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mp-urges-union-govt-to-support-msme-units/articleshow/81658260.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He has been arrested following a complaint by his wife. Initially, the shell-shocked family chose to keep quiet and rushed the youth to a private hospital, where he was declared brought dead. They cremated him without informing the police. However, the deceased’s mother broke her silence on Tuesday and approached police. While investigating, police learnt that the youth, Deepak Kumar, was suffering from a stomach ailment for the past two years and that the father-son duo did get along. However, they are yet to learn the immediate provocation for the murder by Vijender, said Arpit Vijayvargiya, superintendent of police (city). A probe is on, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-hammers-son-23-to-death/articleshow/81657272.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Coimbatore||Close all brick kiln units in Thadagam: Activist||Coimbatore: Farmer-activist Thadagam S Ganesh has requested the Coimbatore collector, chief secretary and director of geology and mining department to complete implementing the Madras high court order to seal all illegal brick kiln units operating in Thadagam valley.Authorities had on March 19 sealed only 22 of the 171 brick kilns that closure notices were issued to. The district administration’s statement that the remaining 149 kilns have been advised to close on their own is being misused by kiln owners and officials of the revenue department, Tamil Nadu generation and distribution corporation, pollution control board and mining department, a letter from Ganesh said. “Coimbatore north tahsildar Maheshkumar and assistant director of mines S Rameshkumar has received a letter from the Coimbatore Brick Manufacturers Association assuring them that the kilns would be closed and requesting them not to seal any kiln owned by its office-bearers,” he said.“Kilns that have stocked red earth have not been sealed and are operating normally. Some government officials advised owners of the kilns to get a good advocate to face the high court in the next hearing. This defeats the whole purpose of the government taking such a crucial initiative in interest of the nation. We will agree with any decision that the collector takes after he witnesses the damage to ecology, loss of life, health, agriculture and water depletion in the north taluk,” Ganesh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/close-all-brick-kiln-units-in-thadagam-activist/articleshow/81658250.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Candidates told to lend voice to workers of garment units||Coimbatore: Members of Citizens Committee and Forum For Protection of Adolescent and Women Workers–Tamil Nadu have placed a charter of demands on behalf of workers in garment units functioning in Tirupur district before the candidates of major political parties in the district. The members requested the candidates raise their voice for their demands in the assembly if voted to power.The members met candidates belonging to all parties in five constituencies – Tirupur North, Tirupur South, Avinashi, Palladam and Sulur – in the district on Tuesday and explained to them in detail about their demands. These demands were charted out after conducting a two-day workshop for women workers to understand their issues.Advisor of the forum C Nambi said that even though many political parties had spoken about the measures that they are willing to take for the welfare of the industries if voted to power, none of them had spoken about the labourers even though about five lakh people are working in garment units and another three lakh people are indirectly related to the industries in the district alone.“That’s why we decided to take up the demands of the garment workers to the political fronts,” he added. About 50% of the workforce are women, while another 25% to 30% of them are adolescent workers.“Against the average working hours – eight hours – most of the workers of garment units function at least 12 hours a day without overtime and dearness allowance. As there is no direct contact between the employers and employees and most of the times workers were recruited through middlemen, the workers could not avail benefits like PF and ESI and often end up getting the wages that the middlemen wish to give them,” he said.Pointing out that a significant percentage of migrant labourers are working with garment units, he said that the district administration maintains no register and does not even know how many migrant workers are in the district.Explaining that about 30 to 40 people are forced to share a bathroom at the garment units during a short interval break, he said that many people especially women stopped taking sufficient water to prevent using the bathroom during the working hours and it, in turn, has taken a huge toll on their health.Most of the units continue to run their hostels without obtaining proper permission from the government and many of the units still do not have an internal complaints committee to address workplace harassments, he pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/candidates-told-to-lend-voice-to-workers-of-garment-units/articleshow/81658256.cms||---

As a result, vehicles, including buses, might be diverted. “The southern flank will remain operational and so, vehicles towards Santoshpur can take the flyover,” said an officer. Police said there was a possibility of at least seven bus routes, including like S-9, AC-9, MW-1, SD-4, SD-16, being rerouted via Anwar Shah connector or Garia.

---||Kolkata||Strict Act returns to make mask offenders fall in line||Kolkata: The rising number of cases has prompted Kolkata Police to change gears in implementation of Covid protocols. After a gap of almost eight months, cops have started slapping cases under 51(b) of Disaster Management Act and under CrPC 200 on those not wearing masks. This will mean the cases will reach the court even if bail is secured from the police station. A conviction will also ensure arrest and up to two years in jail. So far, police were charging Rs 100 as fine under the Calcutta Suburban Police Act pertaining to disorderly act. “While the fine is mainly a deterrent, ‘offences and penalties’ mentioned under Sections 51 to 60 of this special act serve as an effective tool against those acting as an impediment to prevention and containment of the virus,” said a public prosecutor, adding this will lead to the court taking cognizance of the act. Till Monday evening, the Jadavpur police division had slapped charges under section 51 (b) of the Disaster Management Act on five such violators. Police stations in north and central Kolkata like Burrabazar, Posta, Girish Park, Bowbazar and at Kasba and Survey Park in east and south suburban Kolkata are likely to follow suit. Most of these police stations are either in the 27 wards where extra surveillance has been mounted or where reports of violations are rampant. A section of lawyers though questioned why action should be “selective’’ given political parties and their workers are often being found not wearing masks. “Are these drives only limited to non-political people? Or are political gatherings and rallies immune from the virus and the rules? Or have everyone attending political gatherings been vaccinated?” questioned Sourav Ghosh, an advocate. Section 51 (b) states that whoever refuses to comply with any direction given by or on behalf of the government or the district authority shall on conviction be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine, or with both. If it results in loss of lives, the accused will be punishable with imprisonment for up to two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/strict-act-returns-to-make-mask-offenders-fall-in-line/articleshow/81657300.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The music, it turned out, came from the processions of two weddings he was going to solemnise. The sight of the two grooms, gyrating to loud music on the roofs of their cars, infuriated him. He would not conduct the nikaah, he told the families. “I had sent word to them to stop their music. So, they put a break to their rowdy celebrations for a bit when it was time for the evening azaan. But then, they were at it again,” Sufiyan said. “I saw DJ baj raha hai (‘DJ music’ was being played). I said, DJ bandh karwao (stop the music).” The grooms were on their way from Jagatpur in Delhi to marry two sisters from Kairana. In a video that was circulating on Tuesday, people are seen milling around a car atop which one of the grooms is seen dancing with what seems like his group of friends. “They came to me for the nikaah. I refused. Main nikaah nahin padhaunga (I would not conduct the nikaah),” he said. Dejected, embarrassed and in a tearing hurry to save face, the two sisters’ family managed to find another cleric who agreed to solemnise the weddings. They wrapped up the ceremonies quickly, and quietly, and left. But the entire episode had divided the panchayat. Many village elders thought Maulana Sufiyan had gone too far. “They organised a panchayat on Monday evening to discuss what had happened,” Sufiyan said. But he was ready with his defence; Jama Masjid’s Shahi Imam Maulana Tahir stood by him. “Gair shariyat (in defiance of religious law),” the act of playing “DJ music” was called. “We have been asking our brothers not to play such loud music, but many families do not listen. I fully support Maulana Sufiyan’s decision,” said Shahi Imam Tahir, with an appeal and a warning. “I ask the people, once again, to not play DJ music at Muslim weddings. If this happens again, no cleric will conduct the nikaah.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/put-off-by-dj-music-cleric-refuses-to-solemnise-nikah-of-2-couples/articleshow/81657288.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Delhi||Two snatching cases caught on cam||New Delhi: Two minors have been apprehended for snatching a daily wage labourer’s mobile phone in northwest Delhi’s Wazirpur on Wednesday. The incident was captured on a CCTV camera. In another incident, a 30-year-old man’s gold chain was snatched by two men on a motorcycle in Shahdara. Both incidents have been captured on CCTV cameras. In the first incident, a man named Pintu Kumar told police that he had come to Wazirpur Industrial Area to look for a job, when two people caught hold of him and tried to choke him. In the melee, one of them took away his mobile phone and the two ran off. Police said sources were deployed to gather intelligence for the identification of culprits. The accused minors were nabbed after a tip-off. The cops said the minors were addicted to drugs. They have been sent to a reformation home after being produced before a magistrate and an FIR has been registered. In the second incident, a man was targeted while parking his bike near his house in Balbir Nagar locality of Shahdara. The incident took place around 9.30am on Tuesday. A CCTV clip of the area showed two men approaching the target and getting into a scuffle. One of the men is seen holding a gun and warning passersby to stay away. The victim’s mother tried to interfere, but the man with the gun pushes her away. Police said they had lodged an FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-snatching-cases-caught-on-cam/articleshow/81677088.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Swamy accused of bid to overpower govt’||Mumbai: Tribal rights activist Stan Swamy, 83, is accused of belonging to a “terrorist organisation” and conspiring to overpower the government, politically and by using muscle power, a special NIA court said in its detailed order rejecting bail for the Jesuit priest. The collective interest of the community would outweigh the right of personal liberty and Swamy’s old age or alleged sickness would not go in his favour, it added. Swamy, lodged in Taloja jail since his arrest on October 8, was suffering from Parkinson’s disease, the defence had said, seeking bail. The plea was rejected on Monday and the 34-page detailed order copy was made available on Tuesday. Special judge Dinesh E Kothalikar held that from documents produced by the NIA, prima facie it could be gathered that Swamy and other members of the banned CPI (Maoist) had hatched a conspiracy to fuel unrest in the country and overpower the government. Swamy was carrying out activities to further the objectives of the organisation which was nothing but to overthrow “the democracy of the nation”, the court held. “Therefore, I do not find merit in the submissions for the applicant (Swamy) that only because of membership of a banned organisation, the applicant cannot be detained in jail,” the court said. The fact that Swamy was not present in Pune at the time of the Elgar Parishad, blamed for caste violence at Koregaon Bhima, and was not named in the FIR would not take his defence further, considering allegations that he was an active member of a “terrorist organisation”. The court took into account records of exchange of around 140 emails between the applicant and co-accused, and the fact that Swamy, co-accused Sudha Bhardwaj and other members of the Persecuted Political Prisoners Solidarity Committee had condemned the conviction of professor G N Saibaba and others under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for Maoist links. The court also cited a witness’ statement to the NIA that Swamy had delivered a speech on the “arrest of human rights activists in Bhima Koregaon case” at a meeting held by the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR) in Kolkata in June 2019. The witness said he realised APDR works for the release of persons arrested for Maoist links. When the defence contended that the witness admitted he knew Hindi and could not have understood Swamy’s English speech, the court reasoned that considering the tenor of the speeches, one could understand them though it was not in the language known to such a person. “Be that as it may, the fact remains that the applicant had shared the dais and given speech (that) goes to suggest he was actively involved in the activities in respect of release of the accused persons who were involved in Maoist cases,” said the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/swamy-accused-of-bid-to-overpower-govt/articleshow/81658313.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Delhi||Delhi readies for Covid jabs for 45+||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has started making preparations to roll out the Covid vaccination for people above 45 as the central government has opened the vaccination drive for everyone above the age of 45 years from April 1. A Delhi government official said that they had received a communication in this regard. “We have received the communication from the Centre and preparations will be made in advance according to the Centre’s blueprint for giving Covid shots to people above 45,” the official added. Health minister Satyendar Jain tweeted: “The central government has opened Covid vaccination for all people above 45 years of age. Going a step ahead, Delhi government has demanded that everyone above 18 years of age should be given Covid vaccine. In defeating Covid, this step will be an example not only in the country but all over the world.” An official said the number of vaccination centres would be further increased and more manpower engaged to ensure a hassle-free vaccination process from April 1. The confidence of the people on the vaccines has significantly increased since the vaccination began. Currently, 40,000 to 45,000 people are turning out to get the Covid shots every day as compared to 15,000 to 20,000 daily in the initial days of the vaccination. The vaccination was launched from 83 vaccination centres in Delhi from February 16. In the meeting on Monday, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal stressed upon the need to ramp up vaccine coverage with greater outreach and focused information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-readies-for-covid-jabs-for-45/articleshow/81658298.cms||---

A massive raid at local hotels opposite Meerut bus stand was conducted by police on Tuesday. Suraj Rai, ASP, visited one of these hotels carrying a college bag strapped around his shoulder and purchased a liquor bottle quite easily procured. A similar decoy was planned for other hotels in the area. None of these hotels has a licence permit to sell liquor. “We are sure without doubt that the liquor that was served there was illicit. A large consignment of illicit liquor was seized in January and the investigations had revealed that some of the consignment was routed to these hotels. We have informed the excise department also in this regard and they are conducting a separate inquiry in this matter,” Rai told TOI. The owners of three hotels have been arrested and booked under various IPC sections including 272 (adulteration of food or drink intended for sale), 273 (offers or exposes for sale unfit food or drink) and 420 (cheating). Rai said the raid also led to a few customers jostling with the police while some tried to run away. Later, three of the young customers were nabbed and a search revealed they were carrying countrymade firearms. “We have booked the three also under the Arms Act and sent them to jail,” added Rai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/sp-plays-decoy-blows-lid-off-meerut-hotels-illegally-selling-liquor/articleshow/81657307.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Mumbai||Mumbai:Andheri (W) tops in Covid-19 cases, Juhu beach may soon be off limits||MUMBAI: The Andheri (west) civic ward is currently recording the highest number of Covid cases among all the 24 municipal wards in the city. Its daily case count hovers between 200 and 300, prompting civic authorities to intensify the testing drive here. Among measures proposed, officials are weighing shutting down access to Juhu beach, which is partly in the ward and continues to draw a large number of visitors. On March 22, officials said the ward reported close to 300 cases, most of which were from housing complexes. The ward is posting a weekly growth rate of 0.97%. Assistant municipal commissioner Vishwas Mote said, "At Juhu beach we already have our clean-up marshals deployed to penalize those not wearing a face mask. From Monday onwards we also started antigen tests at the bhel plaza on the beach premises…We have also sought police bandobast in case of a law and order situation arising.” Mote added that hawkers are being tested aggressively around railway station areas and markets within the ward. These random antigen tests are being done without the consent of citizens. A refusal to take the test would amount to an offence under the Epidemic Act, 1897 and may invite action against the offender. Local MLA Ameet Satam pointed out that last year the maximum daily cases in the ward touched 150-200, much less than the 250-300 being reported now. "Closing the beach on weekends is much needed. I have also suggested that the vaccination drive be intensified," he said. Juhu corporator Renu Hansraj said restrictions on timings was another way out. Some also pointed out that the large numbers of restaurants, pubs and other eateries that the locality boasts of is seeing plenty of footfalls. Civic activists in the area said the restlessness among citizens who were confined to their homes for the last whole year, is beginning to manifest. AGNI coordinator Zahida Banatwala said people are travelling and celebrations and get-togethers are also taking place. "The authorities need to keep an eye out for such events taking place without permission," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiandheri-w-tops-in-covid-19-cases-juhu-beach-may-soon-be-off-limits/articleshow/81658316.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Delhi||Delhi court upholds Somnath Bharti’s 2-year jail term in AIIMS property damage case||NEW DELHI: A city court on Tuesday upheld the two-year jail term awarded to AAP MLA Somnath Bharti for allegedly rioting and demolishing a wall at AIIMS in 2016. Additional sessions judge Vikas Dhull, however, set aside his conviction under IPC sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) read with section 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object). His punishment under Section 3 of Prevention of Damage to Public Property (PDPP) Act, 1984 and IPC Section 147 (rioting) read with Section 149 was upheld. “The damage to the fence on the wall built on the drain by the unlawful assembly of which appellant was a member stands duly proved by the oral testimony of eyewitnesses,” judge Dhull noted. The court noted that the trial court had rightly convicted Bharti for the offence under Section 3(1) of PDPP Act. “I do not find any illegality or infirmity in the same. Appellant be taken into custody and sent to jail for serving the sentence as awarded by the trial court,” the judge added. On January 22, the trial court had held that a mob that had gathered on September 9, 2016 around 9.45am behind AIIMS demolished the wall and fence. As a result, Bharti was convicted under various charges. The two-year simple imprisonment and Rs 1 lakh fine was awarded to him for damaging public property. Bharti had argued that the security staff of AIIMS couldn’t be considered public servants under IPC Section 21. The trial court opined that Clause 12 of Section 21 covered the security staff of AIIMS under the category of public servant as they got remuneration from the government agency for their public duty. Judge Dhull’s order, however, agreed with Bharti’s contention stating the trial court had “wrongly arrived at a finding that they were public servants” and rejected his conviction under IPC Section 353. Dealing with the charge of Section 323 read with Section 149 IPC, the court noted that the trial court had committed a “grave illegality” in convicting Bharti as the evidence on record was not reliable and couldn’t prove if people had suffered injuries. “Accordingly, the appellant is acquitted for the offence,” it held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-court-upholds-bhartis-2-year-jail-term-in-aiims-property-damage-case/articleshow/81658331.cms||---

The pharma company sought permission from ICMR in the first week of March. under ‘Mission Covid Suraksha’ for the vaccine’s manufacture. The Union government on Tuesday scaled up vaccination by allowing all above 45 to participate. State health officials said it was time production of vaccines was scaled up. Permission was sought for transfer of technology from Bharat Biotech, which has developed Covaxin. The Mumbai-based institute wants Rs 154 crore from state and Rs 87 crore from Union government to set up the laboratory. The programme will be executed in two phases: The first will involve fill-and-finish operations, which can commence by taking the vaccine in bulk from Bharat Biotech. In phase II, Haffkine will start manufacturing doses by taking technology from the pharma company, which will take one-and-a-half years. Sanjay Rathod, MD of Haffkine Bio Pharmaceuticals, said preliminary talks with Bharat Biotech were held late last week. “If the company supplies raw materials, we have committed to produce 12.6 crore doses of the vaccine annually and scale it up to 22.8 crore once the laboratory is in place,” he told TOI.

They said rising costs were an “existential threat” to the sector. A vast majority of polymers and other petrochemicals are supplied to the plastics industry by both state-owned and private oil and gas refining and marketing companies. “Polymers that cost Rs 70 per kg in 2019 now cost over Rs 130 per kg. Such high prices are unsustainable for many small units which may be forced to close. The government should stop exports and streamline domestic supply,” Arvind Mehta, chairman of All India Plastics Manufacturers’ Association, said.

They have proposed that the directorate of transport, in coordination with traffic police, carry out an enforcement drive for a period of 60 days, from April 1 to May 31. “GoaCan has consistently been raising the need for effective enforcement on this matter at the respective district road safety council meetings. However, we still find accidents and fatalities due to the violation of the ban order as in the case in Borim in August 2020 and near Bambolim in January 2021,” the consumer action group wrote to the directorate of transport. The proviso to Rule 93 (8) of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules (CMVR), 1989, allowed goods carriage to carry poles/rods or indivisible load protruding till one meter beyond the rear most point of the vehicle. In its petition before the Supreme Court, SaveLIFE Foundation sought omission of the proviso to this rule. Based on the PIL, on March 5, 2014, the Union Government issued a notification striking down the proviso, thereby putting a ban on vehicles carrying protruding rods or protruding load. In its letter, GoaCan has demanded that an advisory be issued to the electricity department, public works department and the water resources department because “many violations have been noted in connection with works undertaken/contracted by these departments.” Further they have demanded that the transport department put up a public notice ‘to warn owners of transport vehicles of the consequences if the violations continue from April 1 onwards’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/enforce-ban-on-vehicles-carrying-protruding-loads/articleshow/81658367.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||At Bhagat Singh’s birthplace, Left and Sikh groups put on a united show||BANGA: Thousands thronged a conference organised by farm organisations at Khatkar Kalan, SBS Nagar, to mark the martyrdom day of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev — the first such event at the birthplace of Bhagat Singh since January 26. The event became a show of convergence for different ideologies, especially Panthic and Leftist. Almost all speakers emphasised on the need to strengthen unity among groups protesting against the Centre’s three agro-market laws. Sanyukta Kisan Morcha leaders, Nihang Sikh leaders, Sikh preachers and groups, and farm organisations came on a common platform. The common refrain was to remain united and sink past differences. Punjabi singers and kabaddi players also participated. Originally, the pandal for the conference was raised at Khatkar Kalan. But, after rain damaged it in the night, farm leaders raised a new stage in the shed of the grain market in Banga. The conference, named ‘Kisan-Mazdoor Ekta Mahasabha’, was organised by Bharti Kisan Union (Doaba), whose president Manjit Singh Rai and general secretary Satnam Singh Sahni managed to make the conference a convergence point for groups from diverse ideologies. Nihang leaders Baba Nihal Singh Harianvelan, Balbir Singh and Avtar Singh, Baba Sewa Singh (Khadoor Sahib), who also got Padma Shri for his services to environment, and leaders of other Sikh groups said they would remain united and provide all support to the protest on the borders of Delhi, while farm leaders would keep on leading from the front. SKM leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal, Darshan Pal, Jagjit Singh Dallewal and Surjit Singh Phool also addressed the gathering. They said people should be careful of “government’s attempts” to create differences among stakeholders of the protest. Phool underlined that BKU (Doaba) had succeeded in uniting all sections and this was a big achievement. They said Hardeep Singh Dibdiba, grandfather of Navreet Singh, who died during the tractor parade in Delhi on January 26, said differences were fading and the need was to unite youth behind farm leaders. Dal Khalsa leader Hardeep Sngh Mehraj, who organised a rally at Mehraj on a call given by Lakha Sidhana, also addressed the gathering and there were slogans in support of Sidhana too. Dalit sants, represented by Sant Kulwant Ram of Sri Guru Ravidas Sadhu Sampardai Society, said they would also continue supporting the farm movement. “It has united people,” he said. Babbu Mann was the most prominent singer to attend the rally. Later in his speech, Mann said he made it clear to the organisers that he would come only if all sides would stay united. Leftist Sonia Mann takes pride in her ‘Panthic connection’ and then refers to Lenin An interesting manifestation of convergence of Leftist and Panthic identities at farmers’ conference at Banga came out when actor Sonia Mann, whose father Baldev Singh Mann - a Leftist activist was killed by militants and herself known for her Left leanings, especially introduced her uncle (massar) Beant Singh Khiala, younger brother of Major General Shabeg Singh, who had strategised fortification of Darbar Sahib complex before Army action in June 1984 and was killed inside. “People only know me as a daughter of a communist but today I am disclosing another aspect of my life that my massar ji , who is brother of Major General Shabeg Singh, played a crucial role in my upbringing after my father’s death. We have two sacrifices in our family – one of my father and other of Major General Shabeg Singh.” Khiala then addressed the gathering and said that country was being destroyed with wrong policies. Sonia in her own separate address later asked people to read Lenin also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/at-bhagats-birthplace-left-and-sikh-groups-put-on-a-united-show/articleshow/81658335.cms||IP Singh

Candles were lit for the freedom fighters of the undivided India. Foundation chairman Imtiaz Rashid Qureshi remembered the martyrs as subcontinent’s heroes. The gathering passed some resolutions to seek apology from Queen Elizabeth of the UK for the hangings, like she had apologised for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. People asked Pakistani PM Imran Khan to bestow the country’s highest civilian award, Nishan-e-Pakistan, on the Shaheed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/lahore-remembers-freedom-struggle-heroes/articleshow/81658382.cms||---

She just wanted to see how her husband, Shoeb, an art teacher, drew paintings. Over the years, she turned into a self-taught artist. Now she has started providing colourful shelters to the endangered house sparrows. Gazala has so far prepared over 300 sparrow nests which she has gifted to art lovers across the city. This, she says, is her way to protect the species from becoming extinct. “I love house sparrows. After my marriage I realized that there were no common sparrows around the household any more. Then, one day when me and my husband saw a nest prepared from cardboard in a residential society. That inspired me to do something,” said Gazala. “Initially, I prepared a nest for our house. I was pleasantly surprised when a sparrow started nesting in it. She even gave birth to the babies,” said Gazala. She now takes help of carpenters to get wooden nests prepared. “Later, I paint them with acrylic colours. The nests are prepared in such a way that the sparrows get enough space to move in and out. In some nests, I also attach bells and stands where they can sit and chirp,” she said. Gazala learnt painting by watching her husband. “I started painting in January 2018 on the day of Uttarayan,” said Gazala, who since then has put up one solo show and took part in 18 group shows with art works based on themes of environment and nature that have helped her win several awards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/painting-a-greener-future-for-sparrows/articleshow/81657397.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Amritsar||Tributes to freedom fighters at protests||BATHINDA: Tributes were paid to freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev on their 90th martyrdom day at all farm protest sites on Delhi borders and in Punjab on Tuesday. Youngsters reached the venue in Basanti turbans. At most protest sites, the stage was also managed by youngsters. In Singhu and Tikri borders of Delhi, 60 youth activists addressed the crowds. Soil was collected from Bhagat Singh’s native village Khatkar Kalan; Hussainiwala, where the mortal remains of the trio were scattered into the Satluj; Udham Singh’s birthplace Sunaml, Kartar Singh Sarabha’s birthplace Sarabha, Jallianwala Bagh, Anandpur Sahib, Fatehgarh Sahib, and Sirhind. This soil was brought to Tikri and Singhu. Three padayatras (foot marches) also culminated at the protest sites at Delhi borders. Protesters resolved to continue fighting against the central government till it did not repeal the three farm laws. Farm activists have been camping on highways leading into Delhi since as early as November 26, 2020, to seek the repeal of farm laws. Farmers’ unions had initially planned to reach Delhi’s Ram Lila maidan for protest, but their way had been blocked on the day they left Punjab and Haryana villages for Delhi. Farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri, while addressing the gathering at Tikri, said the farmer struggle will continue till the laws were not be repealed. “It is not only a matter of fighting against farm laws, but to build a society free from exploitation, oppression and where working masses should have their say as was envisioned by freedom fighters,” he said. He added youth and farmers had failed the Centre’s attempts to create differences in the farmer struggle. It was said central government is implementing the policies of privatisation, liberalisation and globalization on the instructions of imperialist institutions and due to pro-imperialism and pro-corporate policies of previous as well as present government, the youth faces the crisis of unemployment and illiteracy. This crisis will increase after the implementation of three farm laws. The central government under the garb of nationalism, is actually betraying its people by surrendering the public sector, built by exploiting the hard-earned incomes of its people, to the local and foreign corporate houses. Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union state general secretary Lachman Sewewala emphasised on the need to build a united a movement of labourers, farmers, urban poor and consumers by breaking the differences of caste and religion. It was said that farmers, labourers from Narmada Valley will also participate in the Mitti Satyagraha Yatra from Dandi, and the soil of this valley will be taken to the protest sites in Delhi on March 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/tributes-to-freedom-fighters-at-protests/articleshow/81658344.cms||Neel Kamal

---||Delhi||Medical negligence: Rs 10L relief for ex-serviceman||New Delhi: An ex-serviceman, who was rendered permanently disabled post treatment, has been awarded a compensation of Rs 10 lakh from Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. It found the two treating hospitals negligent and said a medical practitioner should take due care and caution while giving treatment and avoid delay. “Awarding of cost may serve the purpose of bringing about a qualitative change in the attitude of the hospitals for providing service to the human beings as human beings. Human touch is necessary – that is their code of conduct and duty,” said a bench of Dr Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal and Anil Srivastava. Sajjan Singh, a former petty officer, had moved the consumer body alleging negligence on the part of two hospitals during his treatment for accident injuries, which he had suffered on January 16, 2011. He said he was rushed to Base Hospital, where his family members were reportedly told that being an ex-serviceman he couldn’t be treated there as there were no specialist doctors. It was also alleged that the preliminary aid was given to him on repeated requests. Thereafter, he was referred to Mata Chanan Devi Hospital, without being provided an ambulance. Upon admission, the second hospital confirmed amputation of about one or one-and-a-half inches on both his legs for artificial limbs. “After the operation, the complainant’s relatives came to know that the doctor had actually amputated the complainant’s left leg with around 8 inches and right leg by 11 inches below the knee joint, which was totally contrary to what was informed earlier and the same could have been avoided by providing timely treatment to the complainant,” his counsel argued. Singh, therefore, accused both the hospitals of negligence and not providing him a timely and proper treatment. The hospitals contested the claims saying though Singh was discharged from the second hospital on January 20, 2011, he filed a complaint on April 25, 2013 without any explanation for the delay. It was argued that all documents indicated that the patient had been informed from time-to-time and the amputation had taken place only after taking his consent according to the advice and opinion of the expert team of the doctors. The bench noted that instead of keeping Singh, the first hospital referred him to the other facility and without an ambulance “presumably on some flimsy administrative ground” that clearly established negligence. It also said that the second hospital took a lot of time to start the treatment, resulting in the disability of his body, making him totally incapable to keep his body and soul together. “This also resulted in his incapacity to sustain his family owing to his disability.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/medical-negligence-rs-10l-relief-for-ex-serviceman/articleshow/81658385.cms||Aamir Khan

---||Chandigarh||Punjab to double centres for wheat procurement: Bharat Bhushan Ashu||CHANDIGARH: Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said on Tuesday that the state government planned to follow last year’s model of spreading out wheat procurement drive and will stick to its stand of opposing the Food Corporation of India’s (FCI) proposal on direct payment to farmers. “For one, the Centre cannot have double standards on payment. On the one hand, they say that they will respect the APMC Act of states and allow existing mandis to continue; at the same time, they don’t want to acknowledge state laws. For years, payment has been made to farmers through arhtiyas (commission agents) under our APMC Act but now they want to change it. This is unfair,” Ashu told TOI. “Chief minister Amarinder Singhji recently announced the state government’s objection to FCI’s plan. He also plans to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue. A decision will now be taken at the highest level in coming days,” Ashu added. Criticising the Centre for taking the arhtiyas out of direct benefit transfer (DBT) to farmers, Amarinder had last week said an attempt was being made to break age-old time-tested relationship between farmers and commission agents. Even as plans for upcoming wheat procurement in the state were being finalised, Ashu said the food and supplies department planned to double the purchase centres from the existing 1,800 just like last year to carry out staggered procurement. In view of a Covid spike in the state, the Punjab government will start wheat procurement from April 10. “There has been a sudden surge in number of Covid patients and the incidence happens to be more in the rural areas, where the entire procurement operation will take place. We have delayed the exercise by 10 days,” he added.  Ravinder Singh Cheema, president of the Arhtiyas Association of Punjab, said they had written to the chief minister on March 22, saying that Punjab should not yield to Centre’s pressure. Two years ago, the Punjab government had directed all government procurement agencies to link bank accounts of farmers with the Public Finance Management System (PFMS) portal before the procurement of paddy begins. However, this had angered arhtiyas, which made the state government clarify they will continue to have a role in the online system and payments to farmers will be routed through them. “PFMS system was deferred for two years but now the arhtiyas have uploaded a database of farmers on the portal. However, we are apprehensive that the entire strategy of the Centre is to monitor the loan repayment patterns of farmers. Eventually, they will be motivated to sell produce to private players and the gap with MSP will be credited through DBT as subsidy. As in the case of LGP, subsidy amount will only diminish with time,” said Cheema. There are nearly 47,000 arhtiyas in Punjab who meet the needs of around 15 lakh farmers. For their services, arhtiyas claim 2.5% commission for auction and delivery of goods and 18% to 24% interest rate for money given on loan to farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-to-double-centres-for-wheat-procurement-ashu/articleshow/81658391.cms||Vibhor Mohan

Senate is the top body that approves decisions of VNSGU syndicate or vice-chancellor’s office. However, senate members alleged that they were not informed about the mode of meeting — will it be offline or online — till the last moment. It was only on Monday evening that senate members got the message of the meeting being conducted online.Recently, VNSGU held its convocation offline after an order from the governor’s office. Earlier, VNSGU officials had planned to hold the convocation ceremony online.As the meeting began, some of the senators objected to holding the meeting online. Some were irked by the poor connectivity and not getting an opportunity to make representation.Issues related to irregularities during former vice-chancellor Shivendra Gupta were also raised while few members complained that how college principals were harassed during the three years term of Gupta. Commenting over the clout of advisors around VCs, senator Bhavesh Rabari asked, “Does new education policy have rules related to the appointment of advisors for the VC.” Rabari also raised the issue of colleges operating in shopping complex and steps university plans to take against these colleges.Head of Economics department, Srinivas Rao, was miffed over poor connectivity as he could not raise an issue related to grant distribution to a deserving university department. “The grant for computer purchase was distributed equally among all departments. Those who have enough computers also received the money but the same rule was not followed in construction grant,” claimed Rao. He claimed that one department got a larger portion of the construction grant while other departments did not get enough money for construction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/online-meeting-irks-many-vnsgu-senate-members/articleshow/81656459.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||‘Upgrading with future tech is mantra to success’||B V R Mohan Reddy, executive chairman of Cyient and chairman, board of governors at IIT-Hyderabad, answers queries from TOI readers about new opportunities in engineering, employability challenges and why upskilling is important to stay relevantQ. Why is it that students with an engineering degree from a city college get a better package than a B Tech graduate from a college in the districts? And this despite both having the same skillset? - Sai KrishnaA. Corporates make no distinction between urban and rural students and so packages are no different. The selection is purely based on individual capabilities and the job roles. In assessing the capabilities some emphasis is laid on soft skills such as communication skills, interpersonal skills, listening skills, time management, empathy, etiquette, etc. Hiring managers typically look for candidates with soft skills because they make them more successful in the workplace and so become an essential part of the job profile. Students from city colleges tend to do better in soft skills as opposed to students from district colleges. Thus, we see a higher percentage of students from urban areas in the corporate world. Many corporates believe soft skills can be imparted fairly easily and quickly and so the emphasis during assessment is more on technology skills. There is no package difference between urban and rural students. Compensation could vary between different job roles and in a few cases due to a premium for students hired from premier educational institutes – like IITs, NITs etc. Q. I am in final year B Tech (Information Technology) and am very worried about placements. Is it true that most people are not getting jobs in their crore areas? What are my alternatives? -- Madhu Balla A. Technology has been accelerating at a rate never seen before. Technology has also become all pervasive. It is into every conceivable industry. As a result, we are seeing a strong uptake in recruitment this year. You, however, need to have the right skills for ever-changing technologies. Students with right skills continue to get multiple offers. The technology is changing and hence technology of the past can only be the baseline. However, for you to be successful, you need to continuously upgrade yourself with future technologies. Opportunities are growing exponentially in areas like AI, ML, AR/VR, Robotics automation, Block Chain etc. If you can reskill/upskill in some of these areas, there are plenty of opportunities. Q. What importance does NAAC accreditation hold in securing admission in a college? What kind of rankings and accreditation should I consider before seeking admission? -- Goutham N A. NAAC is an assessment and accreditation body that determines and moderates the quality of institutes in terms of education, infrastructure, research, teaching and learning etc. Institutes with top NAAC grades like 'A++' are most sought-after as they offer high-quality education. A good NAAC grade for an institution does reflect great credentials for the institution. However, you need to also look a little more granularly at the institute vis-a-vis your area of interest. If you are interested in ‘autonomous mobility’, the college with high grades may be very good overall when all faculties are put together but may not have the best faculty or lab in this specific area. I would recommend you do a more in-depth research into the colleges with respect to your area of liking before you decide on a specific college. Q. Many studies indicate that most engineering graduates are unemployable in India. After engineering, what kind of additional courses should I pursue to enhance my employability quotient? -- Reeti S A. The rapid change in technologies make learning a continuous journey with no definite destination. Employability is a very real challenge, as many students don’t possess skills required by industry. Digital technologies are transforming businesses, industries and governmental systems. You need to reskill/upskill to digital technologies that have started taking centrestage now and also get exposure to future technologies that are likely to become important in years to come. I would strongly recommend that you visit ‘Futureskills Prime’ platform of Nasscom. It is a great initiative in partnership with the Government of India. Please utilise the same to gain an advantage in the job market. Q. After three years of engineering, I have realised that our college – as in the case with many others – is teaching subjects only for the sake of clearing exams. There is no practical training to make us industry-ready. How can this be fixed? -- Sriram Konda A. I would strongly recommend that you speak to your college management that they should establish a good connect with the local industry. Accademia-Industry connect will make you are more employable. Request your management to pursue the local industry to get more industry relevant projects for all of you. Industry also provides internships and apprenticeships. If you do projects with industry, employability will improve dramatically. The Government of India has simplified apprenticeship schemes and is promoting them strongly. Industry is looking for good students to be apprentices and to contribute to the skill building initiatives. So, collectively all students should convince the college management to start working with industry. Q. My son is keen on pursuing aeronautical/aerospace engineering. What career prospects can he expect? -- Kavitha Chilkuri A. With advances in space exploration and space travel becoming a reality, the future of aerospace/aeronautical engineering is promising. Aerospace is a thrilling industry that offers exciting opportunities. Aircrafts, space crafts, aero engines and avionics are marvels of technology innovation. There is a lot of scope in aeronautical engineering in India. In the recent past, there is a lot of emphasis on Atmanirbhar Bharat, or 'self-reliant India', and hence a lot of scope for developing our own aircraft, aero engines, helicopters, rockets, spacecraft, etc. If your son has passion for aeronautics/aerospace, I would definitely recommend pursuing aeronautical/aerospace engineering. Q. What job options available to those pursuing a PhD in engineering and technology? -- Viswanath Reddy A. Traditionally, PhD would mean that the candidate was a researcher and liked to disseminate his or her knowledge and so teaching was a typical job. But the world is changing rapidly. Several industries are recruiting more PhDs than ever before. A company like Amazon has several hundred PhDs in their research labs. In addition, I see a lot of R&D work being done in Indian companies as the Government of India lays emphasis on Atmanirbhar Bharat. Q. What makes an impressive resume? What kind of mistakes should I avoid in job interviews? -- Krithika Rao A. A resume reflects the candidate’s personality, at the same time it is also a formal document that the company uses to assess candidate’s suitability. Thus it is important that the resume is structured, clear, concise and genuine. It should highlight the career objective, academic qualifications, skills/training and other professional pursuits and achievements which also reflect the candidate’s extra-curricular activities or social service. Some companies have a recommended format – do follow that format wherever it is available. The top few mistakes to avoid in job interviews are: Lack of preparation -- It is vital that the candidate prepares for the interview by learning about the organisation, understanding the job requirements both technical and behavioural and presenting their fit for the opportunity. Preparedness also helps you fight any anxiety you may have while facing interviews. First impressions do matter – Ensure that you are appropriately (conservatively & modestly) dressed for the interview. Your attire is not only a reflection of your personality but also must suit the occasion and is a mark of respect to the interviewers. It sends a strong signal to them that you care about the position you are interviewing for. Over projecting achievements – Example: Avoid presenting the team’s project achievements as your achievement. Humility and teamwork are both valued in the industry, hence present your contribution to team projects and acknowledge the other team members contributions. Hide one’s deficiencies by lying – Example: Accepting that you do not know the answer to some questions is better than making a wild guess or acting knowledgeable in all areas. An occasional “I don’t know the answer” is better than a lame attempt at expertise. Q. How does one identify companies offering apprenticeship? How do we apply for them? -- Swetha Mohanty A. As a first step you should identify the areas that you want to do an apprenticeship in. Next you seek the support of your extended network to identify companies that offer apprenticeship in the areas of your interest. The following are some of the sources that you should tap to get this information – the Training and Placement office, your seniors, your professors, your parents or acquaintances in the industry. Share with them your interest and ask them for their support in identifying companies that may offer apprenticeships. Apprenticeship may not be a very well-established process in a number of organisations, hence it is important that you start your efforts well in advance so that you land an apprenticeship opportunity as per the institute calendar. Organizations offer apprenticeships through the HR / Technical training departments or many may consider this through references. You may need to try both routes to be assured of success. At times you will have to show flexibility to accommodate the timing of the apprenticeship due to the company’s requirements. At such times do reach out to your management if there is some support they can provide around the timing/scheduling the apprenticeship. Q. Apart from the US, which other countries can I consider to pursue BTech, especially amid this pandemic? Also, is it a good idea to procure an overseas degree? -- Krishna Mohan A. I will divide your first question into two parts – a) which other countries can you pursue B Tech? Without hesitation, to me, US is the best. Outside of the US, one needs to look at the language constraint. We mostly pass high school in English medium. To me, Canada, UK, Singapore and Australia/New Zealand would be the order of my preference. If language is not a constraint and you are willing to learn German or Russian, I would recommend Germany and Russia also as great countries for pursuing undergrad education in technology. b) Is it a good idea to pursue an overseas degree? I strongly advocate overseas degrees. More than just education, it makes a student’s development holistic and readies him/her as a global citizen. The learning opportunities outside the class allows one to learn about culture, values, ethnicity, diversity, inclusion, etc. These learning opportunities are very important and make an individual well-rounded professional.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/upgrading-with-future-tech-is-mantra-to-success/articleshow/81658400.cms||---

They want the acquisition process in Punjab halted till the issue of farm laws is resolved. The farmers’ have announced to keep the number of protesters low due to the pandemic. Just 10 farmers from each affected district will participate in the agitation in Patiala. “Around 130 farmers from 13 districts would reach Patiala on Wednesday to protest against the land acquisition for the expressway. Some other farmers whose land is being acquired for some other national highways have also joined us,” said Harmanpreet Singh Jeji, the coordinator of Delhi Katra Expressway Kisan Sangharh Committee (DKEKSC). “We would move from the Rajindra hospital towards the chief minister's residence but will sit down in protest wherever the police stop us. In case the police arrest all protesters, another team of 130 is ready to reach and continue the protest. Several teams of farmers have been made. After five days, the agitation will be intensified,” Jeji added. The farmers are not satisfied with the compensation announced for their agricultural land and also appealing the state government to halt the land acquisition process of the expressway in Punjab till the issue of farm laws is resolved. The farmers claim that the expressway will be 12 feet high and divide their agricultural land. They had earlier joined the protest near Tikri border of Delhi. On Sunday, farmers from Punjab participated in the protest for one day near Tikri border where many from Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Delhi are already protesting against land acquisition under the banner of the National Highways Bharat Bhumi Bachao Sangharh Committee. They are protesting against Amritsar–Jamnagar (NH 754K), Delhi–Mumbai expressway (NH 148), National Highway 334 B, National Highway 344 M, National Highway 152 D and for Sonipat–Palwal Orbit Railway line.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/delhi-katra-expressway-protest-in-patiala-from-today/articleshow/81658409.cms||Bharat Khanna

George on Tuesday said he has called off his election campaign in the region after a section of people tried to trigger communal riots by creating violence during his campaign.  “I won’t create a situation for communal riots and I won’t do any election campaign in Erattupetta,” said George. Those secular people in Erattupetta who wish that peace should prevail in this land will vote for me,” he added. “Don’t think I have taken this step fearing anyone. A section of people is denying my right to seek votes,” he wrote in an FB post. He also said this group is threatening his party workers in Erattupetta. “I am stopping my campaign here taking into consideration the safety of these people,” he said. A section of people had gone against George after some remarks made by him went viral on social media. It was alleged that the remark was against a community and this section had taken a stand against George for some time now. On Monday, George who was campaigning in the region was greeted by boos by some men. George known for his violent outburst reacted to the boos and challenged these people during his speech in these areas. The incidents were reported in Thevarupara and Pathazhapady in Erattupetta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pc-calls-off-campaign-in-erattupetta/articleshow/81658448.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Thiruvananthapuram||P C George seeks continuity as others push for a change||Kottayam: Seventy-eight-year-old Thresiyamma Abraham is keen to vote in this assembly elections. It was 54 years ago that she got a chance to vote for the ‘hand’ when her husband late Abraham George stood as a Congress candidate from Poonjar. Ever since, the seat has been with various other UDF allies until Congress took it back this time and fielded former DCC president Tomy Kallani as its candidate. Kallani is locked in a four-way contest, a rarity in the state, with sitting MLA P C George, Sebastian Kulathungal of LDF and M P Sen of NDA. A tour through the constituency makes it clear that it won’t be an easy ride for George. After his remarks against a community went viral on social media, George is greeted with boos at many places during his election campaign. “He will end up third this time,” says the owner of a tea shop at Pathazhappady in Erattupetta. A little later, as George arrives in his campaign vehicle, a group of people who have gathered near the tea shop, register their displeasure with a barrage of boos. George, in his usual style, has a retort ready and calls them ‘ebhyanmar’ in his speech. If such a trend against George gains traction in the days ahead he will find it difficult to carry out his campaign in certain regions. Despite such incidents, the seven-time MLA is ahead of his rivals in systematic campaigning, thanks to the efforts of his son Shone George, who is heading George’s election war room. Kallani, Kulathunkal and Sen are all focusing on the slogan ‘Vote for Change’ in Poonjar. They also indirectly attack George over his offensive language and comments. Kallani has a few advantages, one being the first Congress candidate after over 50 years here. “This is my first election. I am dedicating myself to you. Vote for change this time,” he says while addressing a gathering at Nellikkachal in Poonjar panchayat. At a meeting in Erattupetta town, seeking votes for Kulathungal, CPM politburo member Subhashini Ali says, “Homemakers are struggling after the Modi government hiked cooking gas prices.”Kulathungal, a former Kottayam district panchayat president, is now with Kerala Congress (M) which is an LDF ally. The crowd cheers as Subhashini Ali mentions promised made in the LDF manifesto to allot Rs 2,000 per month to homemakers. As Kulathungal starts speaking, one never gets the feeling that he was once part of UDF. His oratorical skills makes him different from his rivals here. “People want a new Poonjar. It is about secularism, and preserving our heritage. It is also about maintaining high cultural standards and using decent language, says Kulathunkal. George was hoping that NDA won’t field a candidate here so that he could bag the votes of the temple-goers since he had supported devotees on the Sabarimala issue. Last assembly polls the NDA candidate had got around 20,000 votes. Sen, fielded by NDA, is the district president of BDJS. “In Lok Sabha polls we had received 30,000 votes and we have 6,000 new votes. We are sure we will win,” says Sen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/p-c-george-seeks-continuity-as-others-push-for-a-change/articleshow/81658460.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

Police said the duo hatched the plot as the victim was against their relationship. The minor, who has confessed to the crime, has been sent to a remand home, while her boyfriend, Diljit Yadav (19), has been sent to police custody. Police said the girl, who worked as an intern in a jeans factory, came home during lunch hour on Saturday and distracted her mother, while Yadav gained entry into the house and stabbed her.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC’s antigen test drive sees success rate of 32%||MUMBAI: The BMC, on the first day of its rapid antigen test (RAT) drive, managed only 15,128 of the targeted 47,800 tests across the city. Eight per cent of the people tested Covid-19 positive, said municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal. Municipal officials said that they were hoping to conduct more rapid antigen tests in the coming days, especially in those areas of the city that are known to witness a large number of footfalls. “We are deploying staff and laboratory personnel at more crowded places as compared to the first day,” said a BMC official. On Tuesday in Dadar, tests were done at Shivaji Mandir theatre auditorium, at Kotwal garden and on Senapati Bapat Marg, while hawkers in the Vile Parle station area were also tested. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G-North ward, said: “There was some resistance as people feel that they are stepping out for their own work and we are asking them to undergo antigen testing. However, we make them understand and many have been convinced. Of the total 142 tested in the ward at various places, one only was found to be positive.” K-West ward assistant municipal commissioner Vishwas Mote said five hawkers at Vile Parle railway station tested positive. “Many people make purchases from them and, therefore, they could be super spreaders. The five hawkers who tested positive were immediately asked to quarantine themselves,” he said. In malls, confusion continued to loom as some visitors were not allowed entry without testing even though the BMC circular said that it was random testing only. A visitor who was at Atria Mall in the afternoon said the place bore a deserted look. “They were making everyone entering the mall undergo the test. I was also asked to undergo testing, however I had an RT- PCR negative report with me, so they allowed me in without the testing,” she said. Another visitor, criticising the new RAT drive in malls, where people are expected to pay Rs 250, said the business at malls was likely to suffer as people would avoid visiting these. “Why should people pay for these tests? If a family of four goes to a mall, it will have to shell out Rs 1,000. This makes no sense when you want to bring the economy back on track,” he said. By evening, the updated figures showed that on the first day 15,128 rapid antigen tests were conducted. While 8% of those tested were found to be positive for Covid-19, antigen tests conducted in January before the recent surge in cases had only 2% positivity. Of the 15,128 RATs on day one, the maximum were done in L ward (Kurla), where 2,582 tests were done, followed by H-East ward (Bandra East and Santacruz), where 1,824 tests were done, K-East (Jogeshwari and Andheri east), where 1,600 tests were done, and E Ward (Byculla), where 1,298 tests were done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmcs-antigen-test-drive-sees-success-rate-of-32/articleshow/81658458.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Nagpur||One more tiger dies, no clue in poaching of 2||Nagpur: One more tiger was found dead in Haturna beat under Ashti forest range in Wardha division. The irrigation department staff patrolling the Upper Wardha dam backwaters found the tiger carcass on Tuesday evening. Acting DyCF of Wardha Tushar Dhamdhere said the tiger died a natural death and was around 12-13 years. “Its teeth were worn out and it must not be able to hunt. All the body parts of the animal were intact,” said Dhamdhere. On March 23, two tigers were poached in Nagalwadi and Pandharkawda. The third death was also noticed on Tuesday but as it was growing dark, the formalities were completed on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the forest officials were groping in the dark on poaching of two tigers on Tuesday. A 4-year-old tigress died after its neck got entangled in a steel wire snare trap in Ghonsa in Maregaon range of Pandharkawda. A highly decomposed carcass of a tiger with all its paws missing was found in compartment number 707 in the FDCM area in the Nagalwadi range adjoining Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR). FDCM general manager Rishikesh Ranjan said, “The dog squad went 80 metres towards the road and failed to move further indicating that the criminals must have killed the tiger elsewhere and dumped in the forest. The carcass was 10-12 days old and hence post-mortem failed to reveal much.” Ranjan said, “It seems to be a case of poaching by laying wire snares and not electrocution. The post-mortem was conducted as per NTCA SOP and further investigation is going on.” Pandharkawda deputy conservator Kiran Jagtap said, “The dog squad failed to give any clues but the staff is on the move. The trap was laid for herbivore but tigress got stuck into it.” “As a precautionary step, we are starting an anti-snare drive in seven ranges of the division in the periphery of the villages and small nullahs. These drives will start ahead of Holi with the help of staff, Joint Forest Management (JFM) committees and local NGOs members,” said Jagtap. “Earlier, in June 2019, then DyCF KM Abharna had initiated such a drive with the help of locals when a tiger was killed in wire snares. The drive delivered good results but these moves are temporary. The Pandharkawda division and Tipeshwar have a history of laying wire snares by locals but there is no alternative to foot patrolling,” says Yavatmal honorary wildlife warden Ramzan Virani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/one-more-tiger-dies-no-clue-in-poaching-of-2/articleshow/81676211.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||From a restrained CM to a combative Oppn leader||Mumbai: The mood in the state BJP is palpably upbeat as Devendra Gangadhar Fadnavis takes on the MVA regime, laying bare “corruption in the police” and the “sinister nexus that lies behind routine transfers”. The BJP rank and file thinks Fadnavis’ crusade could augur well for the party, which appeared a tad disconcerted after it lost power to MVA in 2019 despite bagging over 100 seats and needed a rallying point for the 2022 BMC elections. In the past, the former CM has come across as shrill in his role as opposition leader. The Sushant Singh Rajput case and the Kangana Ranaut controversy, to name a few, were instances when he clashed with the MVA regime, but could not sustain the momentum. But Fadnavis has now come into his own following l’affaire Waze, said associates on Tuesday, as he flew out to Delhi to lobby with the Union home secretary for action on the basis of a state intelligence department report containing audio intercepts purportedly pointing to large scale corruption in police transfers and postings. It was the latest salvo from the Vidarbha lawyer-turned-politician in a fast-festering political crisis sparked by the Ambani security scare and its fallout. Observers say Fadnavis’ anti-MVA tirade stems chiefly from his ire over the Sena walking out on BJP in 2019. He was stung by Uddhav Thackeray’s somersault, said a friend. Assuming the Sena’s decision to switch sides had a personal impact, he still managed to get under the skin of his role as Opposition leader, dogged in the belief that power commits blunders. A certain Sachin Waze turned out to be the gaffe he was looking for. Fadnavis rolled up his sleeves to tear into the MVA on the floor of the state assembly early this month, producing call data records of the cop investigating the case and the man in whose vehicle the explosives were found. Fadnavis spoke for nearly two hours, shooting holes into government’s claims. “The speech was packed with sensitive details which only higher-ups in the home department have access to,” said a Vidhan Bhavan official. His friends in the police fed him the crucial details, rued an NCP politician, not realising he was paying a compliment to his networking skills. A week later, Saamna, the Sena mouthpiece, also praised Fadnavis, saying in his assembly speech, the Opposition leader struck all the right notes. “Devendraji has an analytical mind. He can fuse facts into a convincing argument. Also, he loves a good fight,” said BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar. Sources said Fadnavis is aware the BJP bosses in Delhi are not keen on toppling the MVA government. Instead, the party may want him to expose contradictions within the ruling coalition and build a strategic edge for itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/from-a-restrained-cm-to-a-combative-oppn-leader/articleshow/81657507.cms||Ambarish Mishra

---||Delhi||JNU to adopt common entrance test for admissions||New Delhi: Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) will soon be starting a new master’s programme in Hindi translation. The decision was taken in the academic council meeting held on Monday. In the meeting, it was also decided that whenever the central universities common entrance test was conducted, JNU would admit students through it. The university administration has, meanwhile, hit back at the members of JNU teachers’ association (JNUTA) who had on Monday raised objection to the vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar holding meetings of statutory bodies. The members had also alleged that teachers were not allowed to express their opinions on several matters in the meeting. “The JNU administration strongly condemns the downright falsehood and malicious propaganda being spread by a small section of faculty members of JNU about the 157th academic council meeting held on March 22. These faculty members seem to be only interested in damaging the reputation and public image of JNU by spreading trumped-up stories about the conduct of the academic council meeting and decision-taking in the meeting. According to the JNU Act and its statutes, there is no nomenclature as ‘caretaker VC’, ‘interim administrator’ as is deliberately spread by a small section of faculty members,” read a statement signed by registrar Anirban Chakraborty. The administration claimed the meeting was conducted in the presence of over 100 members and in a very cordial and positive atmosphere. Among several decisions, the academic council also approved granting of recognition to Arun Jaitley National Institute of financial and management, Faridabad Haryana to award postgraduate diploma in management (finance) and postgraduate diploma in management (financial management).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jnu-to-adopt-common-entrance-test-for-admissions/articleshow/81658495.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||From teaching to child birth, they sewed up new ties||New Delhi: Constable Dayaveer was on patrolling duty in Wazirpur early in the morning when he came to know of a family in crisis. He rushed to arrange for a vehicle for the woman in labour and helped her reach a hospital. Touched with his gesture, the family named their child after the cop. With schools closed during the lockdown, head constable Tara Chand and constable Neelam of South district started the noble initiative of taking classes for children daily. When a group of five women from Arunachal Pradesh tweeted that they were stranded in Saket and had run out of rations and essential commodities, the local SHO provided them with food items. Speaking to TOI, Dayaveer said, “I was on duty in Wazirpur B-Block when I was informed about a woman in labour. None of the woman’s neighbours and relatives wanted to come close to her since it was the peak of Covid-19 cases. Even the ambulance had not arrived despite several calls. When the PCR got a call, we arranged for a gypsy and rushed her to a hospital.” The delivery took place around noon. The family then called Dayaveer and told him that they were naming their son after him. “I’m a father of twin boys. When I saw that woman in pain, I only thought of rushing her to the hospital. When they named their son after me, I felt happy and proud. A year ago, they were strangers, but now they are family,” added Dayaveer. Neelam and Tara Chand found some children of labourers residing in the premises of an office in Greater Kailash. “We decided to teach them to make the lockdown fruitful for them. Neelam also got food and goodies for the children. We got books and colours to make them learn new things,” said the head constable. The woman constable also brought a sewing machine from her house to the GK police station. “I saw many people wearing the same masks. Some underprivileged people were even sharing them. Initially, I started making masks in the duty officer’s room. Later, two of my colleagues also joined in and we distributed the masks to the underprivileged,” said Neelam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/from-teaching-to-child-birth-they-sewed-up-new-ties/articleshow/81677192.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Haryana: 75-year-old’s plea that his estranged wife can survive on Rs 2,000 pension rejected||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court while deciding a dispute between an estranged elderly couple — the man is 75 years old and his wife is 67 years old — over maintenance allowance made it clear that an old-age pension of Rs 2,000 is inadequate. Upholding that Rs 9,000 as monthly maintenance allowance allowed by the family court to the aged woman cannot be termed on the higher side, the high court said that the old-age pension was not enough even to meet medical expenses. The petitioner’s main plea against the maintenance amount of Rs 9,000 awarded by the family court to his estranged wife was that the amount was on the higher side as his wife has been living in a house provided by him and gets Rs 2,000 as old-age pension. The couple has been living separately on account of irreconcilable differences. “Considering the age of the wife, the old-age pension of Rs 2,000 per month would not be enough even to meet her medical expenses. She is suffering from a problem in her ears and is having knee pain. Considering the pension the petitioner is getting, maintenance of Rs 9,000 per month given to the wife cannot be concluded to be on the higher side,” observed Justice Avneesh Jhingan, who dismissed a revision petition filed by 75-year-old Tek Ram of Panipat district against his estranged wife Mahendro Devi. Tek Ram’s estranged wife had filed an application under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) for maintenance and this was allowed on August 28, 2014, whereby Tek Ram was directed to pay her Rs 5,000 per month by a family court in Panipat. Subsequently, the amount was enhanced to Rs 9,000 per month. Aggrieved from this, Tek Ram had approached the high court and opposed the enhancement of maintenance amount, claiming that his wife was getting an old-age pension, owned agricultural land, and kept buffaloes. He also said that she was getting an old-age pension of Rs 2,000 per month, which is increased by Rs 200 every year. She was living in Tek Ram’s house and he lived with his sister. During the hearing of the petition, Tek Ram’s counsel was not in a position to dispute the fact that the petitioner is now getting a pension of more than Rs 50,000 per month. During the hearing, the HC also found that the woman had no agricultural land and that it had been transferred in the name of her husband’s family members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-rejects-75-year-olds-plea-that-his-wife-can-survive-on-rs-2k-pension/articleshow/81658471.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: With 40 lakh 45-plus on mind, BMC lines up double shifts at vax centres||Mumbai: With the Centre clearing Covid vaccination of all citizens above 45 years from April 1, the BMC estimates the target population will almost double to 40 lakh from the existing 22 lakh of the elderly and other prioritized categories. Anticipating a surge in footfall, the civic body has shortlisted two hospitals that will start vaccinating in double shifts from next week. Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar and Babasaheb Ambedkar in Kandivli will offer jabs from 8am-8pm to accommodate office-goers who may drop in after work. The state government on Tuesday welcomed the Centre’s new step, saying it was one of the demands raised by CM Uddhav Thackeray during a meeting with PM Narendra Modi last week. Thackeray had pointed out many new cases in the state were from the 45-plus age bracket. “The vaccination drive in the state will get a boost with this demand being accepted. Many from this age bracket step out for work and hence need to be vaccinated at the earliest,” said Thackeray. On Monday, the state again clocked record high vaccinations by giving shots to 2,76,354 in a day. Among them were 1,56,474 senior citizens and 48,354 frontline workers. However, merely 6.25 lakh of the targeted 1.77crore from among the priority groups have finished complete vaccination so far. As on March 22, 45.9 lakh people had received at least one dose in the state. In Mumbai, 1.29 lakh have completed the two-shot vaccination, while 9.39 lakh of the 22 lakh prioritised population have got one shot. The turnout declined in the city on Tuesday by 13% to 37,120 from Monday’s 42,420. While senior citizens were a majority, there was a drop in their numbers too. Immunisation officer Dr Sheela Jagtap admitted the initial rush has slowed down, and some centres are seeing crowds only towards the weekend. “The number of healthcare workers and frontline workers too has dropped,” she said. Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, currently in isolation after testing positive last week, implied in a tweet the Centre heeding the state’s request was a welcome coordination and healthy for the nation. Public health officials didn’t respond on how they intended to scale up the drive and what could be the new target population. In Mumbai, civic officials said they have set the ball rolling. Dr Vidya Thakur, medical superintendent of Rajawadi Hospital, said they will be recruiting nurses, data entry operators and volunteers since the existing staff wouldn’t be adequate to work for 12 hours. The centre is currently vaccinating an average of 1,200-1,500 people in a day. “We don’t know how much the increase would be,” she said. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said more vaccination centres would be added to the existing 103. Besides the two, another eight municipal hospitals will start operating for extended hours gradually. A list of 20 private hospitals is awaiting approval from the Centre. Kakani said private hospitals could give another shot at running 24/7 vaccination centres now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-40-lakh-45-plus-on-mind-bmc-lines-up-double-shifts-at-vax-centres/articleshow/81658479.cms||Bhavika Jain

On March 17, officer Chander Shekhar was convicted in one of the oldest cases in the Panchkula CBI court, registered in the anti-corruption branch of the Central Bureau of Investigation in Chandigarh in 2004. The court had convicted the-then general manager (telecom) of Haryana's Rohtak district under corruption charges. Awarding the sentence, the judge wrote in his detailed orders: “Corruption... is the most serious internal threat to our nation. The tentacles of corruption have spread far and wide and moral values of the public servants have touched a nadir. A corrupt public servant is the worst violator of the Constitution. Corruption by public servants not only upsets the balance of society but also works against aspirations of the people of India.” The four-years imprisonment to Chander Shekhar was awarded under the Prevention of Corruption Act with a fine of Rs 1 lakh. The officer was convicted of demanding Rs 50,000 (negotiated to Rs 25,000, later) as bribe for clearing the tenders of a private company for the contract of laying of underground cables in Tosham and Kalanaur areas of Haryana. Afer he was caught in 2004, the CBI searched his house and found Rs 45.03 lakh cash, which was unaccounted for.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cbi-judge-corrupt-public-servant-worst-violator-of-constitution/articleshow/81657516.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

He further added that the proof so far collected shows that some local leaders of Congress have been engaged in enrolling bogus votes. Kumari, a woman who had been given five electoral ID cards, is a Congress sympathizer. She made it clear that it was Congress workers who enrolled her name in the voters’ list, Vijayan said. It was against the votes enrolled by local Congress leaders that opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala raised allegations of bogus votes, the CM said while speaking at a press conference in Alappuzha. “There had been similar allegations earlier as well. There isn’t any allegation that there has been a concerted effort to enroll bogus votes,” he said. He also said the absence of BJP candidates in Guruvayoor and Thalassery is an indication that the party is planning to give its votes to Congress in these constituencies. O Rajagopal, the BJP leader who won from Nemom assembly segment in 2016, as well as V Surendran Pillai, the UDF candidate who had lost, have made it clear that Congress had sold votes to BJP. The demand for a pro-religious state is dangerous whether it is raised by minority or majority communities, Vijayan said, adding that LDF government has the strong backing of women. “The party’s mass base has increased. This has irked both Congress and BJP. So, they may come up with cooked up stories to tarnish the image of LDF. The rape allegation in Nadapuram was one such incident. It had even led to a murder. But, a few days later it was found that the allegation was baseless. On the day of Chengannur byelection, someone cooked up news that DYFI leaders were behind Kevin’s murder. People and LDF workers should keep vigil against such possible attempts,” he said. The CM said Rahul Gandhi is one of the gentle leaders of Congress. Still, Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi share the same policies. On fight against Covid-19, he said Kerala’s efforts have been well-recognized by international media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-local-cong-leaders-enrolled-bogus-voters/articleshow/81658480.cms||---

On March 21, Gurdev Singh and Mehtab Singh Khandewala, who were accused of murder in a dera at Nanded, Maharashtra, were killed in a police encounter near Sursingh in Tarn Taran. In the incident, station house officers (SHOs) Balwinder Singh and Narinder Singh had also sustained injuries. Claiming that police had shot the duo in the back, Panjoli said, “This means Nihangs wanted to save their lives. If it is accepted that Nihangs attacked the police first, then police could have surrounded and caught them. If Nihangs were not in control, police could have shot them in the legs and caught them, shooting straight in the back is nothing but cruelty,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sgpc-seeks-judicial-probe-into-nihangs-encounter/articleshow/81658477.cms||---

Reacting to a query, she said: “Kartarpur Corridor was closed in the name of coronavirus, even though it’s just a day-long pilgrimage. There is no Covid protocol elsewhere.” On DPC’s decisions, she said: “The sangat will soon see the printing and maintenance of the sacred text at Sri Guru Granth Sahib Bhawan of Gurdwara Sri Ramsar Sahib.

With this, no mechanism is prevailing in the city to alert citizens about Covid patients in home isolation. As on Tuesday, the number of Covid patients under treatment in the district is at 33,160, of which majority are in home isolation. An NMC official told TOI, “A citizen lodged a complaint with municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B pointing out that pasting stickers on entrance gate was against the Supreme Court order. As per the apex court order, ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) will have to issue an order under Disaster Management Act if stickers are to be pasted on the entrance gate of the residence of Covid patients in home isolation. Following this clarification, we decided to stop it.” The civic officials had found a few positive patients roaming in the city. A couple of Covid patients had even travelled to other district and state. As per NMC, violation of home isolation guidelines was one of the reasons behind the spike in cases in March. Taking cognizance, the NMC had on March 18 started pasting ‘Positive Covid-19 Patient In Home Isolation’ stickers, mentioning the patient’s name, period of home isolation etc. The civic body had also engaged flying squads to keep watch on people in home isolation. These squads were identifying homes with the help of the stickers. There is a provision of Rs5,000 fine in case of violation of home isolation norms, followed by FIR. The official added the stickers also used to caution visitors such as NMC sanitary workers, vendors, salesmen, meter reading boys etc about Covid positive patient in home isolation. The NMC had proposed to launch facial recognition system with the help of artificial intelligence and 3,800 CCTVs situated across the city to catch positive patients out of home, levy fine on them and admit such persons in Covid Care Centres. If the system materializes, the NMC can prevent Covid patients stepping out of homes and contain spread of the disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-stops-pasting-stickers-at-residences-of-covid-ves/articleshow/81657547.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

She said: “The masters of doublespeak are caught in the act, themselves providing the most irrefutable proof of how meekly Mann and his Aam Aadmi Party surrendered to the BJP on the three Acts while pretending publicly to oppose those. All this time, they had been running with the hare and hunting with the hounds.” Harsimrat claimed that in the entire clip, Mann had spoken not a word against the laws that the farmers opposed. The former minister claimed: “The only thing you can hear is Mann’s seeking a meek clarification on the implications of the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. He is cringing before the chairman virtually, while he pretends to roar in public to befool the masses.” Ridiculing Mann’s accusation that the Shiromani Akali Dal, Harsimrat in particular, had supported the farm bills secretly during a cabinet meeting, the Bathinda MP asked: “Where do you oppose a bill except in Parliament? And how do you oppose it more loudly, more categorically, and more effectively than by quitting the cabinet in protest and rejecting the very draft that the cabinet had considered and approved? Does he (Mann) need to be told why we broke the oldest political alliance in the country?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mann-audio-proof-of-aap-surrender-to-bjp-harsimrat/articleshow/81658481.cms||---

The fertiliser was for plywood factories. The government provides this cheaper urea for the farmers but some locals supply it to the plywood factories of this area. CM flying squad’s sub-inspector (SI) Dinesh Kumar led the team on Tuesday and seized the two vehicles and lodged separate complaints against five accused at the Yamunanagar Sadar police station. In the first case, the SI said he had caught accused driver Rizwan at a checkpoint near Pansara and found no rear number plate on the pick-up vehicle loaded with 22 bags of urea. The SI stated in his complaint: “Rizwan told us he worked for Dawood and Bilal, and after crossing the village, Bilal would have told him about the factory destination to deliver the urea. This smuggling also causes a revenue loss to the government.” In another case, Parveen Kamboj and Rajbeer of Behrampur village are the accused. SI Dinesh stated in his complaint: “I received an input that Parveen Kamboj’s fertiliser depot at Behrampur Chowk supplied agriculture-grade urea to the glue factories for double the government price of Rs 266 for each bag.” The vehicle was chased down to Ratanpura village and found laden with 18 bags of urea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-grade-urea-going-to-plywood-units-seized/articleshow/81658486.cms||JK Singh

The damage was caused during the ongoing highway widening work at Karaswada. This is the third such incident in six months of the pipeline bursting on this stretch for the same reason. Tuesday’s incident occurred at around 10.30am near the Karaswada petrol pump. PWD officials later took up repair works and the damage was fixed by late Tuesday evening. “However, puncture to the pipeline causes delay in the supply network and it takes time for the supply chain to normalise. Water supply will be restored by Wednesday, though it will be restricted,” a PWD official said. Mapusa, Porvorim, Aldona, parts of Saligao and parts of Calangute and surrounding areas will be affected due to the damage. Mapusa locals, however, blamed the contractor of the highway expansion work for the recurring damage to the water supply pipeline. “Over the last six months, this is the third time such damage by the contractor has taken place on the Karaswada junction to Binani road stretch. And, if you consider the stretch from Guirim up to Karaswada junction, this is the fifth time the pipeline has been damaged by the roadworks contractor at different spots on the same pipeline stretch,” a Mapusa local said. The 1,000mm pipeline carries water from the Assonora water treatment plant towards Karaswada and from here the water is distributed to almost the whole of Bardez. “The contractor for the roadworks is completely negligent while carrying out the digging work. It appears that the digging is being carried out carelessly without bothering to locate where water pipelines are. It is high time the PWD penalises the contractor or takes some corrective measures,” said a Porvorim resident. Meanwhile, parts of Ponda and Tiswadi taluka will also receive restricted water supply on Wednesday and Thursday. Work of replacing expansion joints on the Banastarim bridge is being taken up on Wednesday, due to which the conveying water supply pipelines will be non-operational for the day from 9am to 5pm. As a result, Cumbharjua, Panaji, Taleigao, Santa Cruz and St Andre along with parts of Priol and Marcaim constituencies, including defence establishments and Goa Medical College will receive restricted water supply on March 24 and 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/yet-again-main-water-pipeline-to-bardez-damaged-supply-to-be-hit/articleshow/81658549.cms||---

Tourists from these states form a chunk of visitors to Calangute and Candolim. With many anticipating a fresh lockdown in Maharashtra and Karnataka, memories of the pain of the last lockdown are rushing back for tourist-centric business owners in Goa. Many shack owners, who had planned to shutdown early, have still kept their businesses open owing to the steady arrival of domestic tourists until now. But with Covid cases rising again, they are afraid that things could take a drastic turn. Stakeholders fear that lack of checks at entry points for Covid-positive visitors may led to fast spread of the disease in Goa and this may spell doom for the entire industry. “They should seal the border, or at least conduct strict checking,” Ravindra Vengurlekar, vice-president of the North Goa Tourist Taxi Owners’ Association, said. “Cases are going up, so they have to be strict about SOPs and keep the situation under control. We cannot afford another lockdown; this is not the solution. There should be strict testing at entry points and anybody with Covid should not be allowed to enter the state,” he said. Pointing to the lax enforcement of Covid restrictions, a stakeholder, requesting anonymity, said the state government has to restrict the number of visitors at nightclubs to 30. “But no nightclub can run with only 30 customers. So they’re all flouting the SOPs and there’s no one to check them. This is a sure-fire way for Covid to spread,” he said. “The number of tourists coming to Goa has already dropped because of the surge. But more than that, there’s the risk of locals getting infected by tourists arriving from neighbouring states,” a shack owner said. “They should at least start testing tourists at the entry points because there is nobody to check them afterwards. Nobody is wearing face masks on the beach and there’s no police to check this,” John Lobo, general secretary of the Shack Owners’ Welfare Society, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/maha-ktaka-surge-in-cases-worries-tourism-stakeholders/articleshow/81658575.cms||---

The KTC’s special airport bus enables commuters to travel from Panaji or Calangute at a bus fare of Rs 100-150. Speaking at the flag off of the 30 electric buses, minister for transport Mauvin Godinho told KTC managing director, Derek Periera Neto that tourists must also get the benefit of the electric buses. “We have to see the load factor and then decide. We will speak to the director of airports in this regard and then keep two buses on the route,” Neto told TOI. Currently, two buses are operating from Panaji to Goa airport, Calangute to Goa airport and vice versa. The electric buses will likely operate on the current route. “The use of electric vehicles is a global concept. The speed at which diesel prices are rising, no one will be able to run buses or cars. The electric vehicles will be the new concept to adopt. The entire picture will change, going towards green fuel,” Neto said. Godinho also said that the airport taxi counter, which is currently under the directorate of tourism, will soon come under the transport department.

There are backhand services that must be completed to monitor and track the vehicles. It also requires a panic button,” he said. He added that the National Informatics Centre is in the process of handling the backhand matter. “There will also be a policy to retain healthy competition between taxi operators, bus operators and other public transport operators.

---||Goa||State launches 30 electric buses under FAME India||PANAJI: A total of 150 electric buses will be given to Goa, in addition to the 50 vehicles being handed to the state under phase 2 of the FAME India scheme, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said via a virtual message at the inauguration and flag-off of 30 of these buses under the Kadamba Transport Corporation on Tuesday. “The launch of electric buses is an effort towards reducing carbon emissions in the country. These are zero emission vehicles that are soundless and are good for the environment. We have installed more than 2,000 charging stations across India and in the next four years, the price of electric vehicles will further go down. We endeavor to have many more of these vehicles and will also set up infrastructure, like charging stations, for them,” Javadekar said. He added that the central government has given a thumbs-up for 6,265 buses in 65 cities, many of which are currently operating in Indore, Lucknow, Jammu, Mumbai, Patna and various other parts of the country. “People are very happy with the benefits of these buses because they are travelling in a non-polluting vehicle. Once more people start travelling in electrical vehicles, we will be able to protect the environment and become global leaders,” Javadekar said. Along similar lines, the Union minister said that prices of LED bulbs have been brought down allowing people to purchase them, which has further brought down carbon emissions. “Out of the total energy required in the country, we generate 38% renewable energy,” Javadekar said. Speaking at the launch, chief minister Pramod Sawant said, “KTC has potential to be a ‘swayampurna’ corporation. Goa has not been left out of the countrywide electric vehicle distribution. By 2030, maximum transport vehicles must come under electric vehicles to control the pollution levels and reduce carbon emissions.” KTC chairman Carlos Almeida requested the CM to allocate funds to build KTC bus stands at Margao, Mapusa and Vasco in the Goa budget. “We can make money through rent and cover our losses,” he said. The chief minister assured that a decision will be made in this regard. Minister for transport Mauvin Godinho said that launch of these buses is a clear message that “we are taking the right decisions for the environment”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-launches-30-electric-buses-under-fame-india/articleshow/81658642.cms||---

But in West Bengal, the party is against a formidable adversary in Mamata Banerjee and faces the challenge of an inadequate organisational base and a chunk of the electorate, the minorities, not voting for BJP.Who says we don’t have an adequate organisational base? We have formed committees in 85% of booths in the state. In Lok Sabha polls, BJP won 18 seats and lost three by a margin of less than 5,000 votes. Twenty-one seats means 50% of the electorate. This when very few were ready to believe that BJP could win those many seats. There is no such scepticism now about our ability. After 18 Lok Sabha seats, confidence in BJP has increased manifold. I’m fully confident that we will win more than 200 seats.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); In Assam, you have the burden of being the incumbent. Again, BJP faces adverse demographics and Congress has tied up with Badruddin Ajmal’s AIUDF. They have also roped in your former Bodo ally.Congress’s alliance with Badruddin Ajmal will be the principal reason for its defeat. Before BJP formed the government in the state, Assam was known for agitations, terrorism and infiltration. Congress can’t contain infiltration with the help of Ajmal, people of the state know this. In the last five years, over 2,000 armed ultras have surrendered. The state, which used to be under curfew for months, has not witnessed one stretching more than 7-8 days in the past five years. There has been peace in Assam for the past five years. Read AlsoWill Bengal, Tamil Nadu put a spanner in the BJP’s well-oiled election machinery?Unlike the Congress, which was happy as long as it dominated Delhi, the BJP believes in a clean sweep both at the Centre and the states.We have made Assam free of infiltration, lawlessness and terrorism, and now we have pledged to save it from floods. Do you realise that where we are speaking right now, in the heart of Bodoland, more than 5,000 people were killed during Congress rule? However, we signed the Bodo agreement after which peace was restored. What Congress could not do in 60 years, BJP has done in the past five. Five bridges on Brahmaputra have been constructed in the period. We have set up NID, agricultural research institute and, also, a cancer hospital. It was BJP which conferred the country’s highest civilian award, Bharat Ratna, on Bhupen Hazarika. The ‘karmbhoomi’ of Sankardev and Kaziranga were once known for infiltration, which is now a thing of the past.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra have been visiting tea gardens frequently. The garden workers play a decisive role. Do you see an erosion in BJP’s support base?Tea garden workers are strongly with BJP as the Modi government cares about their welfare. Rs 12,500 is given to pregnant women from a worker’s family. All benefits are being sent into their accounts directly and so they don’t have to pay cut money. The Modi government has announced Rs 1,000 crore for several welfare activities for tea garden workers. We believe in delivery and performance. If someone (Rahul, Priyanka) comes for ‘tourism’ and ‘photo ops’, it’s a different matter. It(Congress) has nothing left in Assam and Bengal. BJP will win more than 200 seats in Bengal and form a full majority government in Assam. For Rahul Gandhi, a tour of Assam is nothing more than a picnic. For a party which ruled over four generations of Indians, and whose leaders have done nothing for daily wagers and labourers working in the tea gardens of Assam, to talk about labourers is actually a laughable matter.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); In Tamil Nadu, you are handicapped due to your alliance with AIADMK which has been in office for 10 years and has seen defections. Similarly, in Kerala, despite a steady increase in vote share, you have only flattered to deceive so far. What about Puducherry?In all three states, BJP’s number of seats will increase and NDA will once again form government in Tamil Nadu. BJP has promised swift implementation of CAA in West Bengal, but in Assam, it has been seeking to de-emphasise the law saying it is not an issue. Why this dichotomy?CAA is a national law… we have mentioned it in the Bengal manifesto as TMC had announced that it will not implement it. Congress and Left have an alliance with the Furfura Sharif cleric. CPM has justified it saying the alliance is necessary to defeat a ‘communal’ BJP.As I have already said, these alliances will be the reason for Congress’s defeat. And I fail to understand this party’s definition of ‘secularism’. Congress has an alliance with Ajmal in Assam, in Bengal they have Furfura Sharif Peerzada, and Muslim League is its ally in Kerala. It is for the people of the country to see who is ‘communal’ and doing politics of polarisation. BJP has turned ‘appeasement’ into one of its key themes in West Bengal and Assam. Mamata Banerjee is saying it is part of BJP’s divisive and polarising politics.We have been raising issues which concern the common man. If raising issues of the people is polarisation and divisive, I have nothing to say about such a definition. Mamata Banerjee should first answer why she had banned Durga Puja and Saraswati Puja. Why curbs were imposed on celebrations which are intrinsic to Bengal? On the other hand, we have a positive message to convey; that is, there should be no ban on religious activities. There should be freedom to celebrate festivals. We have no objection to Ramzan or Christmas celebrations either. But we have issues with the kind of politics which seeks to ban Durga Puja and Saraswati Puja in the state. What do you think are the other factors which form the basis of your confidence about BJP’s prospects in Bengal?The biggest factor is the Modi government’s agenda of development. The PM’s vision will strike a chord with the people of Bengal. Lakhs of people are coming to Modi’s rallies and that tells a lot. Besides, if you make calculations based on BJP’s performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, you will get the answer. The people of West Bengal are contesting the polls. They have made up their mind to dump the 10 years of misrule under Mamata Banerjee. More than half of TMC has already quit the party. You have attacked the role of Abhishek Banerjee, Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, in the affairs of the state government and Trinamool. What about the possibility of the offensive turning counter-productive since Mamata has spoken of ‘outsiders’ attacking Bengal’s daughter?I have said several times and reiterate that Mamata Banerjee wants to make her nephew chief minister of West Bengal, whereas PM Modi has taken a pledge to restore the glory of the state and develop it as ‘Sonar Bangla’. It is for the people of the state to decide whether they want to see her nephew taking over as chief minister or the realisation of the dream of ‘Sonar Bangla’ under the guidance of Modi. Look at our party manifesto, it speaks not only about welfare and infrastructure but also about culture and heritage. People of the state are forced to pay cut money for work, which has been justified by Mamata Didi. This corrupt practice must come to an end. There have been protests over ticket distribution. Workers say a large number of ‘outsiders’ were accommodated. On the other hand, a couple of candidates returned the ticket after going public about it. TMC says BJP does not have suitable candidates for all 294 seats.TMC and Mamata Didi will get the answer on May 2. As I have said, we have an organisational base across the state, right down to the booth level. This has been achieved after several years of hard work and planning. There might have been a few incidents of unhappiness but BJP is a cadre-based party and believes in discipline. The entire party is together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/assam/people-of-west-bengal-are-fighting-the-polls-half-of-tmc-has-left-the-party/articleshow/81661060.cms||Akhilesh Kumar Singh

The teachers have also said that they should not be deputed on election duty anymore as this goes against provisions of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. They said that they are required to isolate themselves at home for 14 days if they test Covid positive, even if they are asymptomatic. However, this leaves such teachers in a quandary as there is no provision of sick leave for aided school teachers. “A teacher whether symptomatic or asymptomatic has to compulsorily stay in home isolation for 14 days for the safety of students and fellow teachers. Teachers are not entitled for sick leave and therefore those found positive must be granted special leave,” All Goa Secondary School Teachers’ Association has told director of education Santosh Amonkar, at a meeting held on Monday. The teachers told Amonkar that during the pandemic aided school teachers were given the task of carrying out the Covid-related survey. “So also for election duty for zilla panchayat elections. Considering the increasing deputation of teachers in non-education activities, the NEP 2020 has clearly laid down that teachers should not be deputed on election duty or other similar non-educational duties,” the association told the director, in a representation handed to him. The teachers have also demanded that the training they underwent in May 2020 in online teaching methods should be considered as in-service training by the directorate. “Most of the teachers were on Goa Board duty, despite which they managed to complete the training by working till late evening. As such it should be considered as in-service training,” the teachers have demanded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/special-leave-sought-for-teachers-who-test-positive/articleshow/81658687.cms||---

The complaint filed against the police officers for violating human rights, freedom of speech and personal liberty stated that around 200 peaceful protesters organised a protest march seeking justice for Fr Bismarque Dias who died a mysterious death at St Estevam on November 6, 2015. Superintendent of police Serafin Dias deposed on oath that when the protesters assembled, the executive magistrate informed them that section 144 of the CrPC was in force and that all sorts of protests were prohibited. He deposed that nearly 103 persons were placed under arrest and subsequently released on personal bond the same day. During cross-examination, the complainant admitted that he was not present on the spot at the time of police atrocities against the public and had filed a complaint on the basis of newspaper and TV reports. The commission noted that he never examined any reporters to substantiate any allegations in the complaint and found that he admitted during his cross-examination that order 144 was in force by the district collector at the time, which prohibited all sorts of protests. The police filed an FIR against the protesters under section 143 and 188 of IPC. The commission was told that when the executive magistrate and police inspector approached the crowd and told them that Section 144 of CrPC was in force, they requested the executive magistrate to allow them to conduct prayers, on which assurance they were allowed to proceed to the Panaji ferry point. Instead, they started shouting slogans and marched towards IFFI venue. Thereafter police took the 103 of the protesters into custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-rights-violations-in-nov-2015-protests/articleshow/81538989.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Vijayawada||Project CLAP to clean up towns and villages||Amaravati: In a move to keep all villages and towns clean, the state government has decided to focus on sanitation, particularly on door-to-door collection of garbage. The government has decided to implement CLAP (Clean Andhra Pradesh) programme as part of its cleanliness drive. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy held a review meeting on CLAP (Clean Andhra Pradesh) at his camp office on Tuesday. The state government is procuring 8,000 automatic trucks for garbage collection. Each ward and division in villages and towns would get at least two trucks for transportation of garbage. The new garbage collection vehicles would be launched on July 8. The chief minister directed the officials to fix GPS instruments and cameras to all trucks. He asked the officials to set up dustbins at the end of each street. He instructed the officials to ensure the implementation of two-bin system to segregate the dry and wet garbage right at the household collection point. The chief minister said that compost units should take care of the treatment of the garbage. He asked the officials to set up sewage treatment plants for treatment of waste water to maintain sanitation and hygiene in rural areas. The chief minister stamped his nod to the blueprint readied by the panchayati raj department for implementation the collection of household garbage at the doorsteps of residents. The department proposed to set up another 5,000 compost units to manage cleanliness in the villages. Panchayats have been asked to appoint more sanitation workers for door-to-door collection of garbage. Presently, the scheme is being implemented in all urban local bodies and a few select villages. A team of senior officials visited Indore, Ahmedabad and Ambikapur and studied the solid waste management practices. The officials readied the plan after taking the inputs from the schemes implemented in different states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/project-clap-to-clean-up-towns-and-villages/articleshow/81656838.cms||Samdani MN

Delimitation had spilt his ward 10 into multiple parts. However, notwithstanding the setback, the four-time mayor contested from an entirely different ward and emerged victorious with a margin of 57 votes. “It was a completely new ward for me. Not a single voter of mine from my original ward was there and neither was my own vote in this ward. Despite all the jugglery done, God helped me,” Surendra said. “Surendra Furtado is a brand name in Panaji,” the seven-time corporator said in his usual dramatic style. He and his wife Ruth would otherwise contest and win wards 9 and 10, interchanging them when either ward was reserved for women. But this time it was a different ball game, and he contested and won in ward 6 against sitting corporator Kishore Shastry. He also made sure that Ruth won her fifth term from ward 9. “Credit must go to Surendra for staying afloat against Panaji MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate’s bulldozing, despite him not having the full backing of Congress,” a political observer said. Surendra, who contested his first  in the municipal body way back in 1985, said he took after his father who was a freedom fighter. “When Surendra contested against Manohar Parrikar, Monserrate worked against him. But in the following CCP term Monserrate made Surendra the mayor. Their bond goes beyond politics at times,” another citizen said. He has also drawn some admiration from the Monserrate camp and BJP rank. “Whatever be the criticism against him, when required his heart beats for Panaji and as mayor he would take BJP corporators along for the betterment of Panaji, even though he was in Congress,” a BJP worker said. Another citizen, who actively worked for Monserrate and resides in Surendra’s earlier ward, said he never had to complain about work that needed to be done. “When I met him recently, he told me he knew that my relative was unwell and that he would get the bushes near my house trimmed the day after the counting. And on the day after the counting, he got the bushes cut despite knowing that I was working for Babush in his own ward. Surendra delivers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/delimitation-doesnt-stop-furtado-from-winning-7th-term/articleshow/81658777.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Nellore district collector and returning officer announced opening of filling nominations from the day. The candidates will be allowed to file nominations till March 30 followed by scrutiny on March 31. The by-election was caused by the death of sitting MP and YSRC leader Balli Durga Prasada Rao due to Covid-19. The ruling YSRC, which had won the seat in the 2019, has already named physiotherapist Dr M Guru Murthy as its candidate. TDP has named former central minister Panabaka Lakshmi as its candidate. Lakshmi lost the 2019 general election to Prasada Rao by a margin of 2.38 lakh votes. BJP and Jana Sena have tied-up to fight the election. Though the two parties wanted to contest the elections initially, they agreed to have BJP candidate in the election. BJP is considering three names, sources said. Retired IAS officer Dasari Sreenivasulu, Karnataka’s retired IAS officer Rathna Prabha and former minister Ravela Kishore Babu are in the race. Sources in BJP said the party is considering the candidatures of the two retired officers, which is likely to be cleared in a day or two. Meanwhile, the parties have drawn up a clear strategy for electioneering. YSRC has assigned the campaign responsibility to ministers and MLAs, dividing the seven assembly segments among them. TDP has divided the Lok Sabha constituency into 175 clusters and is giving each cluster to a couple of senior leaders. The party also constituted a committee with party state unit president K Atchennaidu, former ministers Somireddy Chandra Mohan Reddy and Nara Lokesh, senior leaders Putta Sudhakar Yadav and Panabaka Krishnaiah to coordinate the electioneering. BJP too has named its senior leaders to monitor the electioneering under the leadership of former minister Adinarayana Reddy. The party had drafted over 20 of its senior leaders including MPs to campaign for the party in the by-election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/notification-out-for-tirupati-by-election/articleshow/81656851.cms||Gopi Dara

The vehicles for BJP’s development goal of an “atmanirbhar Assam” as it eyes a second term are free education in state-run schools for every child and creation of one lakh government jobs by March 2022. Changing gears from its stance in 2016, when it had promised to protect the identity and land of indigenous communities from infiltrators from Bangladesh, BJP’s 2021 manifesto speaks about the need to safeguard the political rights of the native population. The party's old promise of completely sealing the India-Bangladesh border makes a reappearance alongside a commitment to strengthen the border wing of Assam Police and “enable a support structure” for foreigners’ tribunals to identify and probe investigation of cases of illegal immigration. The manifesto states that the long overdue delimitation of assembly constituencies would be fast-tracked with an eye on protecting the political rights of indigenous communities. While being silent on CAA, the document highlights the BJP-led state government and the Centre’s push for correction of the updated NRC that was published in 2019. “We will initiate the process of correction and reconciliation of entries under the Supreme Court-mandated NRC in a structured manner to protect genuine Indian citizens and exclude all illegal immigrants,” the manifesto states. Referring to the annual devastation wrought by floods, BJP has promised that “Mission Brahmaputra” would “eliminate” loss of life, livelihood and property. “We shall do this through a multi-pronged strategy involving dredging the river (Brahmaputra) and building reservoirs to store excess water in the flood season.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-releases-assam-poll-promises-silent-on-caa/articleshow/81661076.cms||Prabin Kalita

The MP said the TTD pays GST of Rs 120 crore every year on average but only Rs 9 crore returns to the temple body as input credit. During discussions in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, the MP said there were tax exemptions in spiritual and other programmes in all temple bodies in the state, including TTD, before GST was introduced. The MP also expressed concerns over the Centre’s alleged lack of initiative towards representations on a solution to the accummulation of foreign currency and coins sent by the TTD and urged Union minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur to take action. The MP requested the railway minister to speed up work on the special railway zone and urged the finance minister to release Rs 55,656 crore funds recommended by the Central Water Commission (CWC) for the Polavaram project. He requested the rural development ministry to continue the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) in coffee plantations in Araku Valley and Paderu on which more than one lakh tribals depend. In the absence of the scheme, beneficiaries in the tribal tracts wouls lose Rs 15,000 per acre, he said. Meanwhile, minister of state for tourism Prahlad Singh Patel informed the Rajya Sabha on a query raised by Vijayasai Reddy that the Centre has approved the project to develop Salihundam, Thotlakonda, Bojjannakonda and Bavikonda in Visakhapatnam district and Amaravati and Anupu in Guntur district at an estimated cost of Rs 52.34 crore under the Buddhist circuit theme of the Swadesh Darshan scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/exempt-ttd-from-gst-vijayasai/articleshow/81656874.cms||Siva G

Responding to the queries raised by TDP MP Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu in Lok Sabha on Tuesday about the status of implementation of the AP Reorganisation Act, Union minister of state for home, Nityananda Rai said that the Centre was unable to clear SCS to AP due to objection raised by the Finance Commission. He said that XIV Commission had directed the Centre not to give SCS to any state. The minister, however, explained that the Centre had already compensated the state with Special Financial Assistance Package. He said that many of the issues incorporated in the AP reorganization Act were already resolved by the Centre. He said that the Centre had fulfilled the assurances made in the Act. “However, a few issues between AP and Telangana are left unresolved. The Telugu states should resolve them on their own. The Centre has very little role to play,” said Rai. MP Rammohan Naidu expressed his serious displeasure about the statement issued by the home minister. He said that many of the assurances made in the Reorganisation Act were not fulfilled. YSRC floor leader in the Lok Sabha, Peddireddy Mithun Reddy demanded that the Centre should grant SCS to AP without taking the special package granted during the TDP regime into consideration. He said that AP could not get many crucial projects from the Centre even seven years after the bifurcation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/centre-rules-out-scs-for-ap-citing-finance-commission-directive/articleshow/81656904.cms||Samdani MN

Police said that Madhu had lost his job with the lockdown. Unable to afford alcohol, he tried to dilute sanitizer with a cold drink. Family members who noticed him lying unconscious and foaming from the mouth with bottles of sanitizers beside him, rushed him to the hospital where he died receiving treatment the same day. In the second incident, A Satyanarayana, a rickshaw puller, residing near Nehru Bomma Centre suffered the same fate as Madhu. Police said Satyanarayana, who consumed alcohol everyday, had been consuming sanitizer for at least the last four days. On Sunday, Satyanarayana complained of headache and giddiness to his family after consuming sanitizer diluted with water.

As the video went viral on WhatsApp, some grocery stores, milk booths and vegetable markets in the city saw a sudden rush of buyers stocking up on essentials. The district collector and information department’s office responded immediately and started a campaign warning against spreading rumours of another lockdown. “People should stop forwarding fake videos and instead come forward for vaccination,” the collector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/lockdown-rumour-sets-off-panic-buying/articleshow/81656919.cms||Venu Lanka

Alleging that Fadnavis had a role to play in the murder of city architect Eknath Nimgade, NCP workers burned an effigy of the former CM. Pande and Arya demanded a SIT probe into the murder. The Sitabuldi police, led by senior PI Atul Sabnis, detained 11 NCP activists including Arya and Pande for holding the demonstration without any permission. “They have been booked under relevant sections of the IPC and under various provisions of the Epidemic Act,” said the senior PI. Citing a press conference statement by city lawyer Satish Uke, Arya said Nimgade had 57 acres of land worth Rs 300 crore near Nagpur airport. “In 2016, Fadnavis and his PA Kumar Masram asked him to hand over his land as they were interested in constructing a mall at the spot,” he said. As Nimgade refused, he was murdered, Arya claimed. Even Nimgade’s sons claimed that they had given the statements of Fadnavis’s involvement in the murder of their father. yet, neither the Maharashtra police nor the CBI took any cognizance. A political war erupted between BJP and NCP after the former demanded the resignation of Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh over his alleged role of corruption in Rs 100 crore ‘extortion’ charge levelled by former Mumbai commissioner of police Param Bir Singh. On Monday, the BJP workers staged a protest against Deshmukh, while Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha activists had burnt an effigy of the home minister in front of his Civil Lines residence. City BJP president Pravin Datke trashed NCP’s allegations. He claimed that the Nagpur city police is treating BJYM activists like criminals in the case when they allegedly blocked deputy chief minister of Maharashtra Ajit Pawar’s convoy near Amravati Road in Nagpur last month. “The morcha was just for waiving of electric bills of consumers but the city police clicked their photos with name placards,” he said. BJP leaders’ delegation met the commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar on the issue. NCP workers also pointed out the involvement of many ministers from the previous BJP state government in various scams but “Fadnavis had not sought resignations from any of his ministers”. “So how can he seek resignations of home minister Anil Deshmukh over just an allegation,” asked Pande.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ncp-burns-effigy-of-fadnavis-outisde-his-house/articleshow/81667623.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Visakhapatnam||Going green: GVMC to buy 75 e-rickshaws||Visakhapatnam: In a step towards promoting and popularising electronic mobility in the city, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) has decided to roll out 75 electronic three-wheelers (e-rickshaws). While 10 of these vehicles will be used for public transport on the Appu Ghar to RK Beach stretch, the remaining 65 will be used for solid waste collection. The project will be funded by the Asian Development Bank under its ‘urban climate change resilience trust fund’ as part of the Visakhapatnam–Chennai industrial corridor development programme. GVMC will provide land for construction of four battery swapping-cum-service stations for these vehicles. According to a GVMC official, the civic body had proposed to procure four e-buses and 25 e-rickshaws for multi-modal electric public transport as well as garbage collection around three years ago under the same project. "But that has not materialised due to various reasons," the official said. “Now, with increased funding, the corporation is currently in the process of procuring these 75 e-vehicles to suit all terrains of the city,” added the official. The successful bidder will have to supply e-vehicles with supporting charging infrastructure and provide operation and maintenance for five years. In terms of specifications, the e-rickshaws will have full charge range of 90–100km. They will come with an innovative design to unload waste from the cart into compactor bins and mini compactors. The vehicles would also be fitted with public announcement systems and GPS devices. The e-mobility initiative will come with many benefits such as saving on fuel consumption and costs, cut down pollution and greenhouse gas emission, say GVMC officials. The civic body will call for display and performance of vehicles to shortlisted bidders for evaluating actual performance of the vehicles at any high gradient area near the beach road for a couple of days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/going-green-gvmc-to-buy-75-e-rickshaws/articleshow/81657083.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

They dedicate one day a week to contribute to the Mission Rabies project by way of routine education. This volunteer work helps us in penetrating through more communities and areas in the state especially since we are short on manpower due to the pandemic,” director of Mission Rabies, Dr Murugan Appupillai said. The initial plan was to indulge the students in physically visiting schools and colleges to conduct awareness activities, however owing to the pandemic, these tasks are being carried out online. The 20 students were trained by the Mission Rabies team for a few weeks before the commencement of their work. “Principals of various schools and colleges have been very cooperative in engaging their students in rabies education especially since the invite is from GIM students. We intend to cover more areas and institutes in the next academic year, when hopefully more GIM students join us,” Appupillai said. Besides conducting webinars, the students have also been preparing scripts for street plays, theoretical matter for presentations and a plan to cover the target of 37 institutes under this initiative. One of the volunteers Avinash Mendon said that the students have been responsive towards the literature prepared by them on the rabies eradication programme. “Mission Rabies already features in NCERT’s Class VII book. Along similar lines, we are trying to create a module that can be used in future academic texts as part of the syllabus,” he said. “As budding managers, we can implement ideas for the benefit of the society especially now since we are working remotely. We are trying to educate students virtually so that they can take the lead when they are confronted with rabid animals and help make Goa rabies free.” Rachana Gupta, another GIM student said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gim-students-lend-helping-hand-to-mission-rabies/articleshow/81658255.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Nagpur||Exams are here. No sign of mock tests||Nagpur: Even as the Nagpur University’s online examinations start from Thursday, students have not yet been provided the facility to appear for mock tests. They apprehend the new system of web-based link for solving papers would lead to difficulties. After failing to get any response from the NU administration, students vented their doubts on social media platforms, and social media accounts of journalists. They were worried about the fate of papers, as they had no idea how the new system would work. Students said those from rural areas would suffer in the absence of mock tests, as they are not well equipped to handle web-based exams. In summer-2020 exams, NU had provided mock test facility to help examinees get accustomed to online papers, which helped them in a big way. NU Board of Examinations and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable refused to answer TOI’s repeated calls. Pro-vice chancellor Sanjay Dudhe said that the Examination Section under him was planning to provide mock test facility to the examinees. “May be from Wednesday, they will get the facility as instructions have been given to our officials in this regard,” he told TOI. Allaying the apprehensions of examinees, the pro-VC added that web-link based exams were successfully conducted in the past and therefore NU had adopted the system. “We’ve significantly multiplied our server capacity with the help of Microsoft. Hence, we’re hoping that we wouldn’t be suffering from problems faced last year. We’ve learning lessons from the summer-2020 exams. I would advise the students not to panic. We’ve made many changes in the exam system and it would be extremely easy for them to appear,” Dudhe said, hoping that the online exams would be a smooth affair this time. Referring to last year’s stupendous results due to easier exams where 99% of them cleared the exams, the pro-VC reiterated that the students wouldn’t find it easy this time. “Now, they’ve to compulsorily attempt all 40 questions, each having two marks. Those would include fill up the blanks, match the following and other queries apart from MCQs. Even the level of questions would be tough. In summer-2020, they were provided 50 questions and need to solve only 25 of them. It was quite extraordinary situation that time due to Covid-19 pandemic, but this time, we’re fully prepared,” he said. # Number game of winter-2020 exams: 2.30 Lakh – UG examinees 32,000 – PG examinees 2.60 Lakh – Total students 40 – Questions in each paper 2 – Marks per MCQ question 1 – Hour duration for all papers # Prerequisites for exams: * Working webcam on desktop or laptops, or front cameras on mobile phones * Ensure smartphones & laptops are sufficiently charged before exams * Continuous, stable & good internet connectivity is essential * Exam admission card to be obtained from respective colleges * User-ID & password is printed on admission card, it can’t be changed # How to access exam portal: * Type https://www.rtmnu.net on browser in computer/smartphone & press enter * Portal will prompt you to grant access to your location, camera & microphone * If denied access to location & camera, you won’t be able to log in to exams # How to login: * After entering User-ID & password click on check box * Portal will ask you to select faculty, exam/course & semester/year * If paper isn’t scheduled, it will send message ‘Your exam isn’t scheduled today’ * Login to be allowed if correct faculty, exam, semester/year & subject are selected # When logging in for first time: * Portal will prompt for capturing your photo, so ensure that lights are sufficient * Place your face within rectangle & click on capture * If you’re okay, click proceed button, otherwise click capture again * Once captured, photo will be verified for facial characters * If they’re not visible correctly, portal will ask for retaking photo * This photo can be stored only during first time login * It will be used to authenticate student during entire exam * If this fails to match during subsequent exams, students wouldn’t be able to appear||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/exams-are-here-no-sign-of-mock-tests/articleshow/81657292.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||World||Far-right party set to gain new influence after Israeli vote||JERUSALEM: An alliance of far-right groups including openly racist and homophobic candidates appears poised to enter Israel's parliament, possibly as an indispensable member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing coalition, according to exit polls. The Religious Zionist Party includes a new incarnation of the Kahanist movement, a Jewish extremist group outlawed as terrorists by Israel, the United States and other Western countries decades ago over its incitement to violence against Arabs. Exit polls by Israel's three main television channels on Tuesday projected the Religious Zionist Party will win six to seven seats, the best-ever showing by an extreme right-wing party. With Netanyahu and his opponents deadlocked after four elections in two years, he will likely need the group if he succeeds in assembling a narrow majority in the 120-member Knesset, Israel's parliament. Its rise heralds a further shift to the right in Israel, where parties that support Jewish settlements and oppose the creation of a Palestinian state already dominate the political scene. A solidly right-wing government would likely find itself on a collision course with US President Joe Biden's administration, which has pressed for the revival of peace efforts. The Religious Zionist Party is led by Bezalel Smotrich, a longtime activist and former transport minister who has organised anti-gay protests and recently compared gay marriage to incest. In 2016, he tweeted in support of segregating Jewish and Arab women in maternity wards. "It's only natural my wife would not want to lie next to someone who just gave birth to a baby that might murder her baby in another 20 years," he wrote. He has also expressed hostility to more liberal strains of Judaism and said Israel should be governed by religious law. He is allied with Itamar Ben Gvir, head of the far-right Jewish Power party. He is a disciple of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, who incited violence against Arabs, called for Israel to be governed by Jewish religious law and advocated the expulsion of Arabs and other non-Jews from Israel and the occupied territories. Joining them is the openly homophobic Noam faction. As a teenager in the 1990s, Ben Gvir became active in the Kach movement founded by Kahane, who was assassinated by an Egyptian-American in New York in 1990. In a TV interview in 1995, Ben Gvir boasted of stripping an ornament off then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Cadillac, saying "We'll get Rabin too". Weeks later, Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to his peace efforts with the Palestinians. Ben Gvir later became a lawyer who represented Jewish extremists suspected of attacking Palestinians. Until recently, he had a portrait hanging in his living room of Baruch Goldstein, a Kahane disciple who gunned down 29 Palestinians as they prayed in a West Bank mosque in 1994. Ben Gvir has said he favours the expulsion of Arabs who are hostile to the state. In the lead-up to the election Ben Gvir sought to distance himself from Kahane's most extreme views. In an interview with Channel 13 after the exit polls, he said Kahane had done "many good things," adding: "I don't agree with everything Kahane said". The National Religious Party is a strong supporter of Jewish settlements and of annexing the occupied West Bank, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. The Palestinians want the West Bank to form the main part of their future state and view the settlements as an obstacle to peace, a position with wide international support. Netanyahu pressed the three far-right factions to unite to ensure they would pass the minimum electoral threshold. They fell short in last year's election, meaning votes that could have helped Netanyahu went to waste. Now he will need them if he hopes to remain in office and pursue immunity from prosecution on a raft of corruption charges. Their presence in what would likely be a narrow coalition government has raised alarms across Israel's political spectrum, with critics arguing that Netanyahu will be beholden to their radical agenda for his political survival. "The Kahanists want to join the government not just for the ministers' plush seats, the salary and car, an army of aides and funding for their supporters. They have an agenda," Nahum Barnea, a veteran columnist for the Yediot Aharonot newspaper, wrote ahead of the election. "First of all, it means freedom for Jewish terrorists to operate in the territories. Second, it means destroying the justice system. Third, it means apartheid within Israel; racial separation at hospitals, universities, the civil service and the (military). Fourth, it means gender discrimination. Fifth, it means enforcing national-Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) religious codes. They aren't playing around."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/far-right-party-set-to-gain-new-influence-after-israeli-vote/articleshow/81661135.cms||---

The survey had received over 43,000 responses from citizens from 271 districts in the country.“The findings indicated that 60% of citizens believe the new variants have a role to play in the three-fold rise in Covid cases in the last 30 days, while 52% believe the risk of new coronavirus variants leading to a strong second wave is high,” said Sachin Taparia, founder of LocalCircles.Taparia further said to prepare against the new variants or second wave, people say they once again plan to observe Covid distancing and mask protocols followed by eating healthy and exercising regularly. Scientists suggest human behaviour is important to reduce drastically the chances of getting infected.On citizens’ preparedness, the survey findings indicated that majority of citizens plan to observe Covid distancing and follow mask protocols. Also, 69% said they plan to eat healthy food and exercise regularly to be better prepared for Covid variants, and thus minimize the impact.Both the SARS-CoV-2 variants — B.1.1.7 (UK variant) and B.1.351 (South African variant) — have been found in India but due to limited genome testing, less than 500 cases of these variants have been identified so far. The test positivity rate with this “so-called” second wave in India is extremely high.In late December, LocalCircles, based on public feedback, had escalated to the government the risk of mutant coronavirus urging it to stop all flights from the UK and other high-risk countries till the end of January. However, the UK flight shutdown was lifted after two weeks, i.e. from January 8.In the battle against the new variant, the survey showed that most people plan to save more and keep liquid funds available for possible medical expenses. With the daily caseload rising again, the citizens were asked about how they are feeling. In response, 15% of citizens said they are ‘anxious or worried’, 11% ‘depressed or gloomy’, and 3% ‘angry’. On the other hand, 19% were ‘optimistic or enthusiastic’, 26% ‘calm or peaceful’, and 17% ‘thankful’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/60-indians-feel-surge-in-cases-due-to-new-variants/articleshow/81657337.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The surgery was held in Alexis Hospital last month.Gaurav Mandal, a student from Raipur, was rushed to a local private hospital after the accident. As he was suffering from excruciating chest pain, investigations were done and it was found that there was a severe injury to the aorta. The part of aorta had thinned out which is called ‘pseudo aneurysm’ in medical terms. Pseudo aneurysm of the aortic arch is usually a rare complication after trauma. It is fatal when the rupture occurs from the power of the aortic flow.The boy was suggested to undergo an open heart surgery. In view of criticality of injury and need for advanced management, his parents shifted him to Alexis Multispeciality Hospital.Here, interventional cardiologist Dr Rishi Lohiya, interventional radiologist Dr Rajesh Mundada and cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon Dr Puneet Jandial reviewed his condition.“Traditionally, such aortic injuries are treated with high risk supra major surgery (open heart surgery). However, with new technical advancement, such surgeries can be avoided. So, we decided to opt for the modern technique over the traditional mode of treatment,” said Dr Lohiya.Gaurav was admitted and treated with endovascular repair of thoracic aorta using a graft stent.“Endovascular repair is a minimally invasive procedure. It was done with a small cut (incision). As patient was under local anaesthesia, he was fully awake and conscious through the procedure,” said Dr Mundhada.An endovascular stent graft is a fabric tube supported by metal wire stents (also called a scaffold). It was fixed which reinforced the weak spot in the aorta. The graft sealed the area tightly with artery above and below the aortic aneurysm. This ultimately allowed blood to pass through it without pushing on the aneurysm.“When we heard of an open heart surgery, me and my parents were quiet nervous. But the confidence and support of doctors helped us go for the advanced technology procedure,” said Gaurav.After 4 weeks of procedure, a repeat CT scan showed complete healing of the pseudo aneurysm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/docs-repair-largest-heart-blood-vessel-with-patient-fully-conscious/articleshow/81657324.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nagpur||School trustees warn of fast unto death||Nagpur: Members of RTE Foundation, an association of school trustees, have threatened fast-unto-death if the state government does not release pending dues for RTE admissions by March 31. The association president Sachin Kalbande said he’s being forced to issue such a warning because the government has been consistently ignoring the demand to reimburse schools for the free admissions provided under Right to Education (RTE) quota. Kalbande said the fast-unto-death agitation will start in the first week of April at Mumbai’s Azad Maidan. “Earlier this month, I had met senior education officials in Mumbai and was promised that pending funds would be released within two weeks. But that deadline has gone and it’s clear the government has no interest in paying our dues,” said Kalbande. While the government has been paying reimbursements, not all schools have received their dues. Even among the ones which have been paid, there are many schools which claim that only a portion of their bills has been cleared. Kalbande said, “There are two issues which we are raising our voice against. One is the pending reimbursements for which we have submitted bills. The other is the amount fixed in Maharashtra is less than what the central government has ratified. As per my information, around Rs27,000 is to be paid to schools per student, per year, as part of the fee, books and uniform expenses.” In Maharashtra, the current reimbursement rate is around Rs17,000 per student per year. Kalbande said, “This reimbursement bill has to be borne by both the Centre and state in 60:40 ratio. I think, the state is not contributing at all in this reimbursement pool.” Kalbande had earlier been part of a relay hunger strike at Nagpur for the same reason. After this, authorities started taking note of the situation and the association members met senior education officials in Mumbai. At that point Kalbande had accessed documents, through RTI, which showed how much money the Centre had released to the state as part of its share of RTE reimbursements. Kalbande noticed that Rs400 crore received from the Centre seemed to be lying unutilized. “Those funds have been used somewhere else,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/school-trustees-warn-of-fast-unto-death/articleshow/81657341.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

An offence has been registered against Patil for making an attempt to end life. Police said Patil had befriended a 35-year-old married woman, mother of two children, who was disappointed with her husband. They had met through social media and later developed close relationship. In July, 2020, the woman had eloped with Patil to Jalgaon following which a missing complaint was registered at Beltarodi police station. Police said the woman had then refused to return to her husband when she was asked to come back by the investigating team. In February this year, the woman returned to her husband and children. Police said Patil too came to the city to take his love back with him and was staying with the woman and her husband. Patil insisted the woman to accompany him back to Jalgaon, but she refused. The refusal by the ladylove left Patil dejected and he tried to end life by cutting his wrist. The matter was informed to police, who rushed Patil to hospital. After treatment, police counselled Patil, sponsored his ticket to Jalgaon and ensured he left the city immediately to avoid further complications. “It was an emotional problem which needed to be handled with care as leaving it unattended could turn fatal,” said senior inspector Vijay Akot of Beltarodi police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-police-turn-counsellors-in-pati-patni-woh-triangle/articleshow/81657353.cms||Soumitra Bose

The emphasis is on the person who has made that construction,” the bench held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-illegal-bldg-work-to-attract-corporators-disqualification/articleshow/81657382.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

But some employees of the Kadamba Transport Corporation (KTC) see the outsourcing of these buses to a third-party contractor as a threat towards their employment. A delegation from the KTC Drivers and Allied Employees’ Association handed over a memorandum to transport minister Mauvin Godinho on Tuesday, on behalf of the KTC drivers and conductors to retain the existing workers. “Over 1,800 permanent staff employees and workmen are presently employed with the KTC and around 8,000 family members are dependent on KTC for their survival. It is the responsibility of the state government to protect and safeguard the interest of the KTC and the jobs and livelihood of these hundreds of workers and employees,” the memorandum states. Further, it requests chief minister Pramod Sawant to protect and safeguard jobs of existing workers including drivers, conductors, ticket collectors and other allied employees of the state-run transport body. The association also demanded that the KTC should procure at least 150 new buses to maintain all schedules of operations, including the interstate and nationalised routes by employing their existing workers and employees. The association’s president Shashikant Gaonkar and general secretary Christopher Fonseca, met Godinho at the flag-off of the 30 electric buses on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ktc-workers-write-to-godinho-on-job-security-concerns/articleshow/81658449.cms||---

---||Goa||Sanguem locals claim plantations, houses marked as pvt forest||Poinguinim: Opposing the government’s move of classifying certain areas of private land as ‘forest’ in Sanguem, a large group of Sanguem residents, under the banner of Sanguem Bhurakshan Manch, submitted a memorandum to the forest department. The residents said the government move amounts to harassment of those who reside in and around forest areas. The locals said their families have been residing in these areas for generations, but the government will now gain control of the land by classifying it as forest. “Our forefathers developed our private land with hard work, and the government now wants to possess it as private forest. Is this not injustice, particularly to the Velip community, Gaonkars and the Adivasis? I will raise this issue in the coming assembly session. The government should immediately stop the ongoing survey of private land till the villagers are taken into confidence,” said Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar. President of the Manch, Chandan Unandkar, said the land being classified as forest also includes homes of many locals. “The government wants to take away from us not only the privately developed land, but even our houses located in our private land claiming it to be private forest area. I appeal to the people from all talukas of the state to raise their voice against the government’s move before it is too late,” he said. The residents said ward 10 of Sanguem Municipal Council area, where coconut trees, cashew trees and nearly 100-110 residential houses are located, is shown as private forest land. “The government had published a notification in local newspapers inviting objections in respect of private forest. Only a few people were aware of this issue as no newspapers reach certain pockets of the taluka. Hence, its imperative that the government should call for meetings of villagers, duly attended by deputy collector, mamlatdar and forest officials, and discuss the issue threadbare, and then only take the issue forward,” said another local.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sanguem-locals-claim-plantations-houses-marked-as-pvt-forest/articleshow/81658475.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Nandigram land cases: CM poll agent in Calcutta HC for pre-arrest bail||NANDIGRAM/KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s chief election agent Sk Sufian and senior Trinamool Congress leader Abu Taher on Tuesday moved Calcutta High Court seeking anticipatory bail. A division bench is likely to hear their pleas on March 25. Six cases pertaining to the 2017 land acquisition movement in Nandigram have been reopened recently in which both Sufian and Taher have been implicated. The Trinamool on Tuesday also moved the Election Commission, accusing BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari of “harbouring criminals” in Nandigram. “It has come to our knowledge that Suvendu Adhikari, the candidate fielded by BJP in Nandigram, has been harbouring criminals who are non-residents of Nandigram,” the letter dated March 22 said. Signed by the party’s Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien, the letter names four Adhikari loyalists and provides their addresses, alleging that scores of people, who are not locals, are staying in these places and have motorbikes. The TMC has also said Adhikari is visiting one of these locations. Sufian could not be reached for comments. Taher said, “Among the cases reopened, three cases have my name. We have appealed in high court.” He added, “We are ready to comply with all probe-related requirements. We fear the cases are aimed at restricting our movement and work ahead of the April 1 polls in Nandigram from where the CM is contesting.” Among persons implicated by the TMC in its letter to the EC is Meghnath Pal. He said, “This is my home. It is also a BJP election office. People come here. There are four security guards — two police personnel and two private guards. I have reported about them at Nandigram police station two months ago and have the receiving document.” Pal was once a TMC block president. An Adhikari loyalist, he later defected to BJP. Another BJP leader Pabitra Kar’s family also claimed that their home was now a BJP party office, in which several people came and stayed. Kar is also a loyalist of Adhikari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nandigram-land-cases-cm-poll-agent-in-hc-for-pre-arrest-bail/articleshow/81658974.cms||Suman Mandal
---||Kolkata||Cast your vote without fear, Shah urges in Gosaba as he lists manifesto promises||Gosaba/Midnapore: Union home minister Amit Shah assured people in Gosaba, South 24 Parganas, that BJP was set to take office and urged them to vote without fear. “I can guarantee that no goonda will stop you from voting this time. Cast your vote without fear. Goondas won’t be able to touch you,” Shah said before holding a roadshow in Midnapore town on Tuesday. BJP national president J P Nadda did the same in Paschim Midnapore’s Ghatal. Shah paraphrased for the gathering BJP’s Sankalpa Patra that he had released on Sunday to convey what was in store for voters in the nine islands of the Gosaba region. Among these were piped drinking water within two years, four bridges to improve island connectivity, Rs 3 lakh insurance to each of the fisherfolk, financial support to students from Poundra Kshatriya and Dalit Samaj, and a Sunderbans Development Board. “PM Modi-ji has 115 central schemes for the people of Bengal while Trinamool has 115 scams,” the Union home minister said, taking a dig at “bhaipo & company” for “taking away” most of the Amphan relief funds. “We will form a special investigating team to inquire into allegations of corruption over relief distribution during Amphan and Bulbul once the BJP government assumes office,” he said. Shah also promised a Rs 6,500 crore development package for cyclone-hit areas of South 24 Parganas. The Union minister reminded people from the nine Sundarbans islands about the West Bengal CM’s “promise” to make Sundarbans a separate district. “Mamata Didi kept promising to make the Sundarbans a separate district. It didn’t happen. We keep the promises we make. I will make sure all our promises are implemented before I come to this place next time seeking your votes,” he said. At the Midnapore roadshow from Koranitala area, Shah said: “BJP will get enough seats to form the government and nominate a ‘bhumiputra’ as CM.” “I know there is dissent in some pockets, but our workers and leaders will take care of that. People of Bengal will bring about the real change now.” Nadda held a roadshow in Ghatal. “It is just a matter of a few days now. People of Bengal want real change,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cast-your-vote-without-fear-shah-urges-in-gosaba-as-he-lists-manifesto-promises/articleshow/81658913.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

A source in the hospital said, “In the 20-bedded emergency department, an additional 15 beds have been added and there is no space to accommodate any more.” The source added, “On Monday, a patient who had come from the rural parts of the district, was administered a drip at the parking lot on a wheelchair. There were no beds to admit him.” Later in the day, he was fortunate to get a bed in the emergency department. The situation has deteriorated to such an extent that many serious patients are being treated on stretchers, which have been converted into beds, on which they have been brought in. As per records, everyday more than 2,000 people visit the hospital’s OPD, of which, around 400 need to be admitted. Head of MGMMCH Dr Nakul Chaudhury admitted that the doctors and the administration are helpless as the demand for admission has suddenly increased. “On several occasions, family members of patients create ruckus in demand for better facilities, but we are helpless,” he said. Recently, in an effort to improve the conditions at the hospital, BJP state spokesperson Kunal Sarnagi met Union minister Ashwini Choubey and informed him about the condition. Sarangi said people in Jamshedpur and adjoining areas have to depend on Tata Main Hospital for quality treatment, but it is not possible for all to bear the high cost of treatment. Sarangi said Choubey has assured him that steps will be taken to provide better treatment at the hospital. Sarangi said the upkeep and maintenance of the hospital, which caters to the needs of the people of three Kolhan districts, is the responsibility of the state government, but it has done little to take up the matter with the Centre. Notably, time-to-time demands have been made by various citizens’ forums and individuals to improve the conditions at the hospital, but nothing has happened till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/shortage-of-beds-leaves-patients-to-get-treated-at-parking-lot-at-mgmmch/articleshow/81657388.cms||---

The traffic department had last week launched a special drive to enforce safety norms among drivers and riders. Sources said that in five days of the drive, which started on Friday, the four traffic police stations has penalized around 1,755 persons for not wearing masks and slapped a fined of Rs 500 on each of them, collecting Rs 8,78,000 from the violators so far. The fine is being imposed under Section 179 (1) of the Motor Vehicles Act related to violation of the government order. Meanwhile, administrative officials have also resumed inspection of shops and other commercial establishments in the city to prevent violation of norms. The administration has also issued notices to shops where the guidelines are not being followed. While there is no dearth of awareness regarding importance of masks, many citizens are not practicing it. When caught by police most admit they made a mistake while others try to make excuses. SP (traffic) Ajit Peter Dungdung said, “The purpose of the drive is to persuade people to wear masks. The number of citizens moving around without masks has fallen ever since the campaign was launched.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/in-5-days-1755-persons-penalized-for-not-wearing-mask-in-ranchi/articleshow/81657339.cms||Sanjay Sahay

---||Kolkata||‘Ab ki baar 200 me haar’: TMC mocks Amit Shah’s claim||PURULIA/MIDNAPORE: The Trinamool Congress came down heavily on Union home minister Amit Shah’s claim that BJP would win 200 seats in Bengal. While TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee mocked the saffron party’s oft-used “Ab ki baar...” slogan, saying, “Ab ki baar 200 par nahi, ab ki baar 200 me haar (This time around, you will not win in 200 seats, you will lose 200 seats)”, chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleged that police forces were being “selectively sent” from BJP-governed states for the polls, in order to “grab votes”. Abhishek said the TMC would go on to win 250 seats. “Keep daydreaming”, he told Shah at a rally in Keshpur on Tuesday. The chief minister questioned the manner in which police forces were being sent for the Bengal polls. “You are sending Uttar Pradesh police. Why? To grab votes. You are selectively sending police from BJP-governed states,” she said at a rally in Purulia. She also took exception to the fact that central agencies in poll-bound states would not be under the Election Commission, like state administrations are. Vowing not to “cede an inch” to the BJP, she urged party workers to keep month-long vigil of EVMs. Along with central forces from CRPF, BSF, CISF, SSB, ITBP and RPF, 50 companies of armed police from UP and MP will be arriving in Bengal for the polls that begin on March 27, said sources. “They (the Centre) have a lot of agencies. During elections, the entire state administration comes under the EC. So, why shouldn’t the central agencies in the five states (which are going to the polls) be under the EC? In addition, you are sending police from BJP-governed states,” the CM said. Her statements come after after several central agencies — CBI, Enforcement Directorate, and even the NIA — have started summoning senior state officials and TMC candidates in connection with various cases. “Every day, TMC is being harassed (by the agencies),” the CM said. Abhishek said at the rally that Shah had “lost his mind”. He said Shah had declared in Gosaba that the Sunderbans would be a separate district and get rupees two lakh crore. “Bengal has 23 districts, Sunderbans will then be the 24th. If they spend the same for all districts, they will need to spend around Rs 50 lakh crore for Bengal. The state has around 10 crore people. This means, everyone of you would get Rs five lakh immediately. Let them do it now, and Trinamool will not contest the elections. We contest to work for people. If people get Rs 5 lakh, people win. Let him do what he says.” The CM alleged she had seen a video in which “the BJP’s Jhargram candidate is offering money for votes. Oder bolun 500 taka cash chai na, bina poisar gas chai. (Tell them you don’t want their Rs 500, but free cooking gas.) You them you want petrol and diesel at lower prices; you want kerosene, adding, “Take the money they offer but vote for TMC. It is your money they are giving you back for votes.... Every time before elections, they make tall promises. First ask them why Rs 500 or Rs 1,000, they should give you the Rs 15 lakh in your bank accounts first. I have information that some (TMC) polling agents have been offered Rs five lakh to ‘help with votes’. Yes, they will help. They will help you so much that you will never return to Bengal. If they keep doing this, lodge a complaint with the Election Commission.” She told party workers that the BJP would try out underhand tactics to win and “loot” votes. “Do not to accept food or tea from unknown persons, as they will intoxicate or sedate you, and tamper with your votes when you fall asleep and flee”, she warned them, adding, “They also have a lot of agencies with them.” Urging them to be vigilant at all times, she said: “Police may ask you to go away when you keep vigil of the EVMs. Tell them politely to do their work and you keep doing yours. Every vote is important. Protect the EVMs. BJP will try to loot votes. If anyone offers you biryani, refuse it. Have home-cooked food for all these days. Who knows, the food being offered may be poisoned or drugged.” Trying to establish a direct connect with people, the CM said: “Amar upor abhiman kore BJP ke vote-ta deben na. (Do not vote for BJP even if you are angry with me). They may be different candidates, but you are voting for me. Every vote of yours helps candidates win and will allow me to the form the government. I have come to you with an injured leg today to plead with you not to let BJP enter your homes. They will destroy all that we value.... You had voted for BJP in the Lok Sabha. What has your MP done? He spends most of his days in Jamshedpur or Dhanbad. It is I who work for you night and day. If you want me to work for you, you must vote for us. This is not an election for Delhi, but an election for Bengal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ab-ki-baar-200-me-haar-tmc-mocks-shahs-claim/articleshow/81659180.cms||Sujoy Khanra

TMC supporters from Pataspur blared microphones with a parody taunting Sisir and his son Suvendu while the Adhikari patriarch spoke and later mobbed the MP’s car and heckled the veteran leader while he was leaving after the public meeting. Central forces rescued the MP from the spot. What allegedly sparked the Trinamool reaction was Sisir’s comment against the TMC high command. “They have pushed me to the BJP camp. Now I will listen to what my son Suvendu says,” he said. Sisir had come to campaign for BJP candidate Sumita Sinha. The meeting spot was at a stone’s throw from Pataspur, that comes under a different police station. TMC supporters used the location to their advantage and kept irritating the veteran leader. They also mobbed Sisir’s car, prompting his security to call in central forces. “They blared microphones taking advantage of the location. But they should know that I have come across such a situation. I know those who led the nuisance to spread tension in the area. I have with me all the names and photographs. Action will be taken against them in due course,” Sisir said. Trinamool Uttar Kanthi candidate Tarun Jana described the incident as a “spontaneous outburst” against Sisir’s “nonsense” remark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sisir-heckled-car-mobbed-at-egra/articleshow/81658966.cms||Suman Mandal

The chariot, a joint initiative of World Vision, Unicef and the state department of school education and literacy, started off from the district collectorate office premises. Singh said, "The chariot will visit the schools located in different blocks and motivate the students to wash their hands and make them aware of the benefits of handwashing, particularly in view of the coronavirus pandemic. At present, the district has 565 schools." He added, “We want the children to understand that half of the diseases afflicting people nowadays can be eliminated by washing hands properly.” District education officer Nilam Eileen Toppo, who was present on the occasion, said, “If anything is consumed with clean hands, disease-free food goes into the body and the person will not be ill. This awareness is necessary among the children so that they remain healthy.” She said the children should not be in a hurry while washing their hands but take at least 30 seconds in doing so. Ghanshyam Sah, the representative of Unicef support team, said posters related to the campaign will also be pasted in the schools visited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bokaro-dc-flags-off-chariot-to-promote-handwashing-among-school-kids/articleshow/81657357.cms||Divy Khare
---||Ranchi||Tighter norms for Covid hospitals, contact tracing in high infection areas||RANCHI: The Jharkhand government is implementing tighter norms for hospitals and re-enforcing contact tracing exercises to get a grip on the increasing number of new Covid-19 infections in several parts of the state. In the last four days, Jharkhand has recorded more than a hundred new cases on three days and the rolling seven-day average of new cases reached 97 on Monday night, after falling to a low of 40 on February 24. At 796, the number of active Covid cases neared the 800-mark in Jharkhand and breached the 400-mark in Ranchi on Monday.  Health secretary Kamal Kishore Soan on Sunday dispatched a letter to the deputy commissioners of all 24 districts and directed them to enforce a set of 15-protocols in government and private hospitals handling Covid cases. Soan directed the DCs to ensure that each such hospital forms an infection prevention and control committee, undertakes periodic training of hospital staff on prevention and control practices, introduces a 14-day duty roster for doctors working in Covid wards followed by a week’s quarantine, undertakes periodic screening of hospital staff for infection and screening of visitors. The hospitals are to also ensure separate elevators for Covid patients and staff attending to Covid wards, identification of infected patients in OPDs and in-patient wards and their segregation and proper hygiene. “Even health staff, including treating physicians and (those) managing Covid-19 patients should be separate and should not enter regular areas under any circumstances,” the letter read. In another letter, Soan directed the DCs to map the newly infected patients and identify areas which are reporting infections for aggressive contact tracing. “Such clusters will be designated if there are at least three infections within 24 hours from separate houses within a 50 meter radius. Health workers will visit a minimum of 100 houses in the vicinity and undertake contact tracing exercises,” the letter read. In rural areas, contact tracing exercises are to be undertaken if two cases are detected in a population of 1,000 people within 24 hours. The district administrations were also directed to survey markets, shops and milk booths in proximity to such clusters and screen customers and sellers for possible infection. The DCs were also directed to ensure that people who came in contact with infected patients and are showing symptoms, are to be put through rapid antigen tests (RAT) and then sampled for RT-PCR tests. The administration was also directed to press medical officers into the homes of infected Covid patients within 24 hours of getting infected to ascertain whether he or she was co-morbid and needs to be admitted to hospital. Dr Devesh Kumar, public health expert at Ranchi’s Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), said: “This is the second wave of the pandemic sweeping India and Jharkhand. There are two reasons for it. Firstly, the people became complacent when cases subsided. They socialized, attended weddings and partied. Social distancing protocols went for a toss. Secondly, there may be a possibility of mutant strains spreading in the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tighter-norms-for-covid-hospitals-contact-tracing-in-high-infection-areas/articleshow/81657342.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Another Jana Sangh candidate Chiranjit Barui, is contesting from Hooghly’s Pursurah while Ranjan Mukherjee has filed nomination from Uttarpara. Khanrasaid: “Locals have been ignored. This is unacceptable. I wanted to protest that.” Mukherjee, who recently defected from Trinamool to BJP, wanted to protest againt the saffront party’s candidate in Uttarpara. “I was disgusted with TMC and left the party. But the same set of people have joined BJP now. I wanted to protest against that.” Denied ticket in Hooghly’s Saptagram, BJP state committee member Swaraj Ghosh, who is also the party’s Hooghly Kisan Morcha secretary, defected to Trinamool on Tuesday. Handed the party flag by secretary-general Partha Chatterjee at Trinamool Bhawan, Ghosh said: “In BJP, we used to speak out against the syndicate in TMC. Now those very tainted leaders are in BJP. TMC has cleansed itself of them and BJP is full of such leaders.” Ghosh added: “You can check who has been nominated for the Saptagram assembly seat. Who is this person? What has he done for people as an MLA? I do not want to be associated with this party any more and want to work for Mamata Banerjee and with her for Bengal.” Along with Ghosh, three Bengali actors too joined Trinamool. Actors Payel Dey, Rezwan Rabbani Sheikh and Priya Paul joined the party in Partha Chatterjee’s presence. Several BJP old-timers who got themselves associated with Shiv Sena are contesting as Independent candidates.

There is no place for people who sell their spine, who conspire,” Banerjee said, after leading a roadshow for several hours. “The people who gathered today have already spoken. ‘Mir Jafar and company’ will forfeit their deposits on May 2. I have seen people in whose homes BJP flags are fluttering showering flower petals on us. This blessing will not go waste,” Banerjee said. “To serve their self-interests and scared of CBI and ED, they have done treachery. It isn’t just a treachery with the party or Mamata Banerjee, it is a treachery with the people. Since 2014, they have been betraying people. Why will people forgive it? Midnapore is a land of freedom fighters. People here gave their lives but not their souls. Will they forgive such betrayers and traitors?” Banerjee said. “Today remember the date. Match 23. Today we have done the khuti-puja (a reference to offering puja to Devi Durga), on May 2, we will complete the immersion,” he said. Attacking the BJP and its leaders for false promises, Banerjee said, “They speak of Sonar Bangla. Yes Dilip Ghosh (BJP state president) will extract gold from cow milk, and they will do it. What stopped them from making a Sonar Bharat for all these years?. Do they think people will believe what they say?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/abhishek-in-contai-adhikari-familys-clout-will-end-on-may-2/articleshow/81658903.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The vehicle of Trinamool candidate Partha Pratim Das was attacked in Birbandar area of Khejuri on Tuesday. Das claimed the attack was orchestrated by BJP supporters when he was busy campaigning. BJP leader Shubhrangshu Shekhar Das junked the allegations. Trinamool candidate and actor Birbaha Hansda staged an agitation in Lalgarh when she found out that the BJP roadshow “didn’t have a permit”. She informed the EC and the returning officer, prompting the latter to ask BJP to withdraw its programme. As a result, BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari had to return without staging a scheduled roadshow on Tuesday in Lalgarh.
