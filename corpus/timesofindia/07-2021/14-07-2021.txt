Fore, a former head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) who was appointed to run Unicef by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in 2018, will stay in the job until a replacement is found. Since it was established in 1946, Unicef has had seven executive directors - all Americans. Guterres thanked Fore for "her inspiring leadership of Unicef and for her service to improve the lives of children all around the world," noting Unicef's critical role in the global response to Covid-19, UN spokesman Farhan Haq said. "As a result of her leadership, Unicef is now an organization with a broader array of public and private sector partnerships and a bolder focus on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals," Haq added, referring to a set of global goals adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2015. They include ending extreme poverty and hunger, reducing inequality and achieving gender equality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/unicef-chief-to-step-down-after-nearly-four-years-in-job/articleshow/84388278.cms||---

The protests, called for by relatives of the victims of the August 4 blast, swelled by the evening, with dozens of demonstrators streaming in to join families storming Fahmi's heavily guarded Beirut home. The angry crowd, demanding accountability as the anniversary approaches of Lebanon's worst peace-time disaster, were pushed back by riot police who swung batons and fired tear gas to disperse them. AFP correspondents saw a man with a bleeding wound on his head after he was beaten by security forces, and paramedics treating protesters for tear gas suffocation. The detonation of a huge stockpile of fertiliser at the port last summer killed more than 200 people and wrecked huge swathes of the capital. An investigation launched in the wake of the tragedy has yet to hold any officials to account. Victims' families say political interference has derailed the process. Earlier this month, Fahmi rejected a request by the judge investigating the blast to question Abbas Ibrahim, head of the General Security bureau, one of the country's top security agencies. "By refusing to lift Abbas Ibrahim's legal immunity, the interior minister is standing between us, the relatives of blast victims, and justice," said Paul Najjar, who lost his three-year-old daughter Alexandra to the explosion. Fahmi "is killing us a second time," he told AFP outside the minister's home. During Tuesday's angry protest, relatives tore off the gates at the entrance to Fahmi's apartment building, as well as displaying portraits of the deceased in a makeshift shrine and piled up white coffins nearby. "These are the coffins of our children," Najjar said. The stand-off, which started in the afternoon, escalated with the arrival of dozens of angry demonstrators after sunset. Protestors chanted: "the people demand the overthrow of the regime!" Last month, rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch called for a UN investigation into the explosion, in light of Lebanon's stalled probe. Lead judge Tarek Bitar is demanding that parliament lift the immunity of three former ministers so he can proceed with investigations but lawmakers have requested more evidence before deciding on whether to waive immunity. Bitar this week rejected parliament's request, a judicial source told AFP. In February, Bitar's predecessor as lead judge in the probe was removed by a court, which had questioned his impartiality because his home had been damaged in the explosion. Judge Fadi Sawan had issued charges against caretaker premier Hassan Diab and three former ministers in December for "negligence and causing death to hundreds", triggering outrage from politicians. Diab resigned in the wake of the explosion but has stayed on as caretaker prime minister as the country's bitterly divided political leaders wrangle over a replacement for his government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/relatives-of-lebanon-blast-victims-scuffle-with-police/articleshow/84388883.cms||---

Page 33 of the book has pictures of many famous personalities, including Muhammad Ali Jinnah, national poet Allama Iqbal, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, Pakistan’s first PM Liaqat Ali Khan, philanthropist Abdul Sattar Edhi, Begum Raana Liaquat Ali Khan (the first PM’s wife) and Bhatti, recipient of Pakistan’s highest military award Nishan-i-Haider. Malala's face besides the latter has raised the hackles of the establishment because, unlike in the West, she isn't quite everyone's favourite in her native country. While copies of the book are already in circulation, sources at the textbook board said the police and other agencies were searching bookstores across Lahore to ensure no more copies are sold. On Monday, a team of officials reportedly first conducted a raid on OUP’s office in Lahore’s Gulberg locality and confiscated the entire stock kept there for distribution. They also handed over a letter to the press, stating that the book had not been issued an NOC yet. Quoting an anonymous publisher, Karachi's Dawn newspaper reported that the book had been submitted to the textbook board for a review in 2019 as part of the process of seeking an NOC. "Meanwhile, the Oxford University Press has published the book despite not being issued the NOC," the publisher said. He said the board’s officials, police and other agencies visited his shop, inquired about the book and read out the confiscation order. Last year, Punjab’s curriculum and textbook board had banned 100 books that were deemed to be "against" the two-nation theory, or were found "unethical and illegal".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-seizes-blacklists-textbook-for-malala-yousufzai-picture-besides-war-hero/articleshow/84389021.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

---||World||The US says order coming this week on border asylum restrictions||FORT WORTH, TEXAS: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will issue an order this week about how migrant children are treated under a public health order that has prevented people from seeking asylum at the nation's borders, a Justice Department attorney said Tuesday. The comment by Assistant US Attorney Brian Stoltz at a court hearing in Fort Worth, Texas, may be the strongest indication to date that changes are imminent on the last major Trump-era restrictions on asylum at the border. Stoltz told a federal judge that the CDC will release ``a new order on the subject of the children'' by the end of the week. It will revise a Biden administration policy that exempts children who cross the border alone from the asylum ban. Stoltz did not offer additional details on the changes during a hearing on a lawsuit that Texas brought to compel enforcement of the public health order that former President Donald Trump's administration used to quickly expel people from the country during the coronavirus pandemic. The government attorney said the CDC order this week will largely render Texas' arguments moot. He did not elaborate, and the CDC said it could not immediately provide additional information. His comment that the order will apply to children suggests that the Biden administration is considering a gradual lifting of the asylum ban. Higher Covid-19 vaccination rates have brought increasing pressure on the Biden administration to lift the public health order that was always intended as a temporary measure during the pandemic.  While the administration has exempted unaccompanied children, some families and nearly all adults travelling alone are expelled from the United States _ often to Mexico within two hours _ without a chance to seek asylum. Lifting the ban could encourage more people to come to the border to seek asylum at a time when the US is under mounting strain. The UN refugee agency reported last month that the US was once again the top destination for asylum-seekers in 2020, with about 250,000 new claims filed, more than twice as high as second-place Germany. Texas, which has the busiest corridor for illegal border crossings, was seeking a court order forcing the federal government to cease what state Deputy Attorney General Aaron Reitz called ``de facto non-enforcement`` of the asylum ban. Reitz argued that the Biden administration's posture ``threatens the health and safety of all Texans.'' US District Judge Mark Pittman, a Trump appointee, questioned Stoltz about the timing of the new order and asked that the government inform him as soon as it is issued. Pittman did not rule on the request for an injunction but said he will put out a decision ``as quickly as I can.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/the-us-says-order-coming-this-week-on-border-asylum-restrictions/articleshow/84388949.cms||---

The MoD had given these two tasks to the NHIDCL in 2018 in addition to another tunnel at Shinkun-La pass, which are crucial for all-weather connectivity to Leh from Himachal Pradesh. In a letter addressed to the defence ministry on June 26, the National Highway and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (NHIDCL) has said despite the organization putting its "earnest efforts" over the last three years to complete the DPR for Shinkun-La tunnel including the Airborne Electro-Magnetics (AEM) survey, the MoD has approved the BRO’s option of the tunnel with the shorter length, "although BRO is yet to prepare the DPR" "In view of the above and the fact that BRO is directly under the MoD and understands the requirements of MoD well, it is proposed to return the DPR works of the remaining two tunnels of Lachung-La and Tanglang-La to MoD on as is where is basis and MoD is requested to clear all the pending dues of NHIDCL incurred till date," the NHIDCL has said. The defence ministry in March 2018 had urged the NHIDCL to undertake feasibility study and preparation of DPRs for three tunnels – Shinkun-La, Tanglang-La and Lachung-La on priority on payment basis. The DPR consultants had submitted inception report for three tunnels in July and August 2020. The DPR for Shinkun-La was completed in December last year. The NHIDCL has also carried out the AEM survey of Shinkun-La and Tanglang-La in March and May this year. However, at a meeting chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh a decision was taken to go for 4.25 km tunnel proposed by the BRO instead of NHIDCL’s proposal for 13.55 km tunnel. Then in June another meeting was held under highways minister Nitin Gadkari and BRO proposal was approved "considering time constraint".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/highway-ministry-body-seeks-transfer-of-tunnel-project-preparations-to-bro/articleshow/84390047.cms||Dipak K Dash

Racine County Sheriff Christopher Schmaling said the initial shooting happened about 7:30 am at the Pilot Travel Center in the village of Caledonia. Schmaling said a 32-year-old man approached and "viciously executed'' a 22-year-old man putting gas in his car. Schmaling said the gunman then shot at another person driving through the Pilot parking lot (that person was unhurt) and then drove away. The sheriff said the man then approached a person who was filling up his car at a Mobil station about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) away. That man happened to be an undercover sheriff's investigator with 21 years of experience, Schmaling said. He said the two men exchanged gunfire, and the suspect was struck several times and killed. The investigator was also hit and was taken to a Racine hospital, where he was conscious and alert, the sheriff said. "It should be noted, ladies and gentlemen, this is 7:30 in the morning at this Mobil station. It was bustling with activity. People getting their gas. People getting their morning cup of coffee. There is no doubt in my mind the quick, heroic actions of our investigator saved lives today,'' he said. Schmaling said he had watched video of the initial shooting. Though he described the shooting as an execution, he gave no indication of what preceded the attack. Schmaling did not provide the names of the shooter or his victims, but did say the gunman was from Hartland and the man he shot and killed was from Elkhorn. One witness to the aftermath of the shooting at the Pilot, just off Interstate 94 about 22 miles (35 kilometers) south of Milwaukee, described "a sea of people'' fleeing from inside the station. A trucker who declined to give her name, citing fears for her safety, told The Associated Press she had just pulled into the Pilot to fuel up when a man ran out of the store. She said she then saw a truck ahead of her back up and make a U-turn to leave. "Then, everybody starts running out of the Pilot, it's truckers just running, sea of people, this one guy is yelling, 'Run! Run!' and I'm like, `Oh my God,'" the woman said. She also said that she asked one of the people what was going on. "He said that somebody's in there shooting,'' the woman said. She said she did not witness any shooting or see anyone hurt. In a statement, Pilot Co spokeswoman Stephanie Myers said it's "an open investigation, we are cooperating fully with local authorities.'' The statement went on to say that the "safety and well-being" of the company's' employees and customers "is always our main concern.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/sheriff-man-kills-one-at-gas-station-is-slain-in-shootout/articleshow/84389035.cms||---

---||World||Biden pushes for voting rights law amid Republican opposition||PHILADELPHIA: President Joe Biden, under pressure from US civil rights leaders, said on Tuesday it is a "national imperative" to pass sweeping voting rights legislation that has stalled in Congress amid Republican opposition. Numerous Republican-controlled states have approved laws that either restrict voting or change election rules following Republican former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him through widespread voter fraud. The voting rights legislation sought by Biden faces an uphill battle in Congress, where his fellow Democrats have been stymied by Senate Republicans. Biden's focus on the subject, even if the legislation fails, allows him to rally support among Democratic voters as his party works to maintain control of Congress in the 2022 midterm elections. During a speech in Philadelphia, Biden made a searing critique of what he called efforts to undermine voting rights, likening those efforts to past laws that prevented Black people and women from voting in the United States. "They want to make it so hard ... that they hope people don't vote at all. That's what this is about," Biden said of those efforts. According to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, at least 17 states this year have enacted laws that restrict voting access, with more being considered. Biden's party and civil rights groups have opposed these voting restrictions, which critics have said are aimed at Black, Hispanic and younger voters, who have helped elect Democrats. Many Republicans have justified new restrictions as a means to combat voter fraud, a phenomenon that election experts have said is rare in the United States. Senate Republicans blocked the Democratic-backed voting rights bill that would expand opportunities to vote before Election Day, make certain campaign contributions more transparent and change the process for drawing the boundaries of House of Representatives districts. Republicans said the measure violates the authority of states to set their own election laws. The Republican National Committee pushed back against Biden's criticisms. "After Democrats failed to pass their federal takeover of our elections ... Biden is continuing their dishonest attacks on commonsense election integrity efforts," RNC spokesperson Danielle Álvarez said in a statement. "Meanwhile, Republicans are engaged in state-led efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat, and polling shows Americans overwhelmingly support these laws." Biden chose a city heavy with symbolism to make the speech. The Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution were both signed at Independence Hall, just steps away from the National Constitution Center, where he will make his remarks. According to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, at least 17 states this year have enacted laws that restrict voting access, with more being considered. Biden's party and civil rights groups have opposed these voting restrictions, which critics have said are aimed at Black, Hispanic and younger voters, who have helped elect Democrats.

---||World||Cuba curbs access to Facebook, messaging apps amid protests -internet watchdog||HAVANA: Cuba has restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Telegram since Monday, global internet monitoring firm NetBlocks said on Tuesday, amid widespread anti-government protests. NetBlocks, based in London, said on it's website that the platforms in Cuba were still partially disrupted on Tuesday, which was "likely to limit the flow of information from Cuba." The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did Telegram and Facebook Inc, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp. Social platform Twitter Inc said it found no blocking of it's service. Thousands of Cubans joined demonstrations in cities and towns throughout the country on Sunday to protest Cuba's economic crisis and handling of the pandemic, with some calling for an end to communism. The government has said the demonstrations were orchestrated by US-financed counter-revolutionaries, manipulating frustration with an economic crisis largely caused by the decades-old US trade embargo. Underscoring the government's concern, state-run media reported on Tuesday that Raul Castro, who stepped down as head of the ruling Cuban Communist Party in April, attended a meeting on Sunday of the political bureau to address the "provocations." Party leader and President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in April he would continue to consult Castro on matters of utmost importance. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday that believing the demonstrations were US-directed would be a "grievous mistake" and show the government was not listening to the voices of the Cuban people. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday the tough situation in Cuba was "basically" due to the US economic embargo against the country. His Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, said on Tuesday he had spoken to his Cuban counterpart to determine what sort of humanitarian aid would help the Caribbean nation. The protests, rare in a country where public dissent is tightly restricted, appeared to have mostly died down by Sunday evening as more police and military were deployed to the streets and Diaz-Canel called on government supporters to go out and fight to defend their revolution. Still, a protest took place in the southern Havana suburb of La Guinera late on Monday, according to five locals and video footage obtained by Reuters. Hundreds of protesters faced off with police, shouting "down with communism" and other anti-government slogans, said two residents who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, adding that they had heard gunfire. Around 150 people were arrested during or following the biggest wave of protests in various cities on Sunday, according to exiled rights group Cubalex, and only 12 had been confirmed released so far. "In the multiple interrogations, we made it clear that no one was directing us from abroad to take to the streets, that no one paid us a centave to do what we did," theater director Yunior Garcia, who was arrested at a protest in Havana on Sunday, wrote on his Facebook page. He said he was released on Monday but police officials told him that he remained under investigation. The introduction of mobile internet two-and-a-half years ago is a key factor behind protests in Cuba, giving Cubans more of a platform to express their frustrations and enabling the word to get out quickly when people are on the street. Reuters witnesses in the capital said on Tuesday they still had no mobile data. Mobile internet outages have increased this year. Network monitoring company Kentik said it observed the entire country go offline for less than 30 minutes at around 4 pm on Sunday, during the peak of the protests in Havana. Social media platforms are facing increased demands from governments globally to take down certain content, and in some cases are seeing their services restricted or banned during times of protests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/cuba-curbs-access-to-facebook-messaging-apps-amid-protests-internet-watchdog/articleshow/84390914.cms||---
---||World||Joe Biden targets non-compete agreements, which restrict the job opportunities of millions of low-wage workers||COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY: Employers owe their employees nothing in the relationship except earned wages, and employees are at liberty to quit at their option. As the rule is generally stated, either party may terminate the arrangement at any time for a good or bad reason or none at all. In keeping with that no-strings-attached spirit, employees may move on as they see fit - unless they happen to be among the tens of millions of workers bound by a contract that explicitly forbids getting hired by a competitor. These "noncompete clauses" may make sense for CEOs and other top executives who possess trade secrets but may seem nonsensical when they are applied to low-wage workers such as draftsmen in the construction industry.  A 2019 business survey found that 29% of companies paying an average wage of less than $13 an hour required all their employees to sign non-compete agreements. President Joe Biden seems to agree about the oppressive nature of non-compete contracts. On July 9, 2021, he called on the Federal Trade Commission to ban or limit them. As a scholar of employment law and policy, I also have many concerns about noncompete clauses - such as how they tend to aggravate the power imbalances relationship between workers and bosses and suppress wages and discourage labour market mobility. The birth of at-will employmentCourts began to enshrine the at-will doctrine in the 19th century, making exceptions only for employees with fixed-term contracts. In Payne v. Western & Atlantic Railroad Co., the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that a railway foreman in Chattanooga had the right to forbid his workers from buying whiskey from a merchant named L. Payne. Payne had sued the railroad, claiming it couldn't threaten to fire employees to discourage them from buying goods from a third party. The court disagreed, arguing that the railroad had a right to terminate employees for any reason - even one that involved dealing with an independent merchant. The notion of at-will employment and its associated lack of job protections soon rose to the level of constitutional mandate. The 1894 Pullman strike, which disrupted national rail traffic, prompted Congress to pass the Erdman Act four years later. That law guaranteed the right of rail workers to join and form unions and to engage in collective bargaining. But the Supreme Court struck down that law in 1908. Writing for the majority in Adair v. the United States, Justice John Marshall Harlan explained that since employers were free to use their property as they wished, they could impose and enforce their own labour rules. Employees, in turn, were free to quit. The court summarized the law with the following statement: "The right of a person to sell his labour upon such terms as he deems proper is, in its essence, the same as the right of the purchaser of labour to prescribe the conditions upon which he will accept such labour from the person offering to sell it," Harlan wrote. That might sound reasonable, but the Adair ruling led to the proliferation of "yellow dog" contracts threatening workers with firing if they joined or organized unions. The term disparaged people who were willing to accept such conditions, but the principle had widespread legal approval. For three decades, the at-will doctrine stymied legislation that would have protected labour rights. Even when a supervisor tried to seduce a longtime employee's wife and fired the employee in revenge, courts refused to protect the man from losing his job. Labour rights and the lawWith the passage of the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, all private-sector workers and unions gained the power to collectively bargain with employers. Subsequent labour agreements, such as the one negotiated by the Steel Workers Organizing Committee with Carnegie-Illinois Steel in 1937, made employers prove "just cause" before firing any person covered by the contract. The Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1991 added employment protections prohibiting discrimination based on race, gender, religion and national origin. And the Americans with Disabilities Act, which Congress passed in 1990, ensured that persons with disabilities would have access to jobs with or without reasonable accommodation. Those laws and other measures, including modern exceptions to the at-will rule, offer workers some security. But they provide no federal protection from noncompete clauses. Noncompetes and low-wage workersIt's unclear exactly how many U.S. workers are subject to a non-compete, but the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimated in a 2019 report that it's around 28% to 47% of all private-sector workers. The leeway for employers to impose these provisions varies widely from state to state and is in flux. California, North Dakota and Oklahoma are the only states to ban them outright, while about a dozen forbid them with certain types of low-wage workers. Washington, D.C., also outlaws all non-compete agreements. At the same time, some states, such as Georgia and Idaho, have made it even easier for companies to enforce them. Critics have pointed out the disadvantages of noncompete clauses to unskilled labour. "By locking low-wage workers into their jobs and prohibiting them from seeking better-paying jobs elsewhere, the companies have no reason to increase their wages or benefits," Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan said when she sued the Jimmy John's fast-food franchise in 2016 for making its employees sign noncompete clauses. The chain subsequently agreed to drop its noncompetes, which had also come under fire in New York. The clauses had barred the sandwich maker's workers from working for other companies that earn more than 10% of their revenue from "submarine, hero-type, deli-style, pita, and/or wrapped or rolled sandwiches" for two years after leaving the Jimmy John's payroll. Efforts to limit noncompete clausesGiven the patchwork of state laws - and reports that companies are using noncompetes even in places where they are banned - a uniform federal rule could clarify the situation and benefit both employees and employers. The FTC has a range of options, from banning noncompete clauses entirely to limiting their use to executives and others who may possess trade secrets or other confidential information. The agency could require that the clauses come with certain due-process protections, such as a right to arbitration of contract disputes. Executives who sign noncompete clauses already get these kinds of protections, not to mention lucrative buyout provisions. If employees with lower pay and less prestige aren't free to get new jobs, I believe their bosses have a corresponding duty to extend to them the rights enjoyed by people at the top of the corporate ladder, particularly independent third-party dispute resolution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-targets-non-compete-agreements-which-restrict-the-job-opportunities-of-millions-of-low-wage-workers/articleshow/84390456.cms||---

A decade after it was notified by BDA, Kempegowda Layout has turned into a dumpyard. “If Bengaluru’s architect Kempegowda visited the area, he would have insisted on removing his name from the layout,” said HK Gowdaiah, resident of the layout’s 3rd Block. The BDA’s lackadaisical approach to provide amenities has resulted in the layout not having roads, streetlights, sanitary lines and water connections. Only a few allottees have preferred to build houses on their plots. The vacant plots are only drawing trucks that dump waste indiscriminately. Gowdaiah lamented that with no basic facilities provided, no one is willing to construct houses. During a visit to the layout on Monday, a TOI team found garbage dumps on several plots and spaces earmarked for parks. A few labourers were seen installing manholes but the layout needs more to be done. Residents alleged that trucks from as far as Kengeri and Yeshwantpur come and dump garbage in their midst. They said bulk waste generators and BBMP vehicles too come and throw waste in the layout. The area is also littered with construction debris.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/kempegowda-layout-turns-dumpyard-residents-fume/articleshow/84388340.cms||Kiran Parashar
---||World||US Covid-19 cases are doubling over three weeks, experts blame fast-spreading delta variant||The Covid-19 curve in the US is rising again after months of decline, with the number of new cases per day doubling over the past three weeks, driven by the fast-spreading delta variant, lagging vaccination rates and Fourth of July gatherings. Confirmed infections climbed to an average of about 23,600 a day on Monday, up from 11,300 on June 23, according to Johns Hopkins University data. And all but two states _ Maine and South Dakota _ reported that case numbers have gone up over the past two weeks. ``It is certainly no coincidence that we are looking at exactly the time that we would expect cases to be occurring after the July Fourth weekend,`` said Dr. Bill Powderly, co-director of the infectious-disease division at Washington University's School of Medicine in St. Louis. At the same time, parts of the country are running up against deep vaccine resistance, while the highly contagious mutant version of the coronavirus that was first detected in India is accounting for an ever-larger share of infections. Nationally, 55.6% of all Americans have received at least one Covid-19 shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The five states with the biggest two-week jump in cases per capita all had lower vaccination rates: Missouri, 45.9%; Arkansas, 43%; Nevada, 50.9%; Louisiana, 39.2%; and Utah, 49.5%. Even with the latest surge, cases in the US are nowhere near their peak of a quarter-million per day in January. And deaths are running at under 260 per day on average after topping out at more than 3,400 over the winter _ a testament to how effectively the vaccine can prevent serious illness and death in those who happen to become infected. Still, amid the rise, health authorities in places such as Los Angeles County and St. Louis are begging even immunized people to resume wearing masks in public. Meanwhile, the Health Department in Mississippi, which ranks dead last nationally for vaccinations, began blocking posts about Covid-19 on its Facebook page because of a ``rise of misinformation'' about the virus and the vaccine. Department officials are also recommending that people 65 and older and those with chronic underlying conditions stay away from large indoor gatherings because of a 150% rise in hospitalizations over the past three weeks. But the political will may not be there in many states fatigued by months of restrictions. In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is facing a drive to repeal a law that she used to set major restrictions during the early stages of the pandemic. And Republican Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama pushed back against the idea that the state might need to reimpose preventive measures as vaccinations lag and hospitalizations rise. ``Alabama is OPEN for business. Vaccines are readily available, and I encourage folks to get one. The state of emergency and health orders have expired. We are moving forward,'' she said on social media. Dr. James Lawler, a leader of the Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, said bringing back masks and limiting gatherings would help. But he acknowledged that most of the places seeing higher rates of the virus ``are exactly the areas of the country that don't want to do any of these things.'' Lawler warned that what is happening in Britain is a preview of what's to come in the US ``The descriptions from regions of the world where the delta variant has taken hold and become the predominant virus are pictures of ICUs full of 30-year-olds. That's what the critical care doctors describe and that's what's coming to the US,`` he said. He added: ``I think people have no clue what's about to hit us.'' President Joe Biden is putting a dose of star power behind the administration's efforts to get young people vaccinated. Eighteen-year-old actress, singer and songwriter Olivia Rodrigo will meet with Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci on Wednesday. While the administration has had success vaccinating older Americans, young adults have shown less urgency to get the shots. Some, at least, are heeding the call in Missouri after weeks of begging, said Erik Frederick, chief administrative officer of Mercy Hospital Springfield. He tweeted that the number of people getting immunized at its vaccine clinic has jumped from 150 to 250 daily. ``That gives me hope,'' he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-covid-19-case-are-rising-again-doubling-over-three-weeks/articleshow/84391283.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Finally, monsoon checks in, makes big splash on Day 1||NEW DELHI: After a long and agonising wait, the capital finally woke up to monsoon showers on Tuesday, with good spells of rain in the morning and later in the afternoon leading to a welcome drop in temperature and freedom from the oppressively humid heat of the past few days. There was, however, no relief from traffic chaos. Roads in large parts of the city were already waterlogged by the time people set out for work, leading to bottlenecks and snarls for commuters. that frustrated commuters. Arriving 16 days after its normal date, this was Delhi’s most delayed monsoon onset since 2002, when the rain-bearing wind system had entered the capital on July 19. The IMD said the monsoon had covered not just Delhi-NCR but also the remaining parts of the country on Tuesday. Between 7am and 8.30am, Safdarjung – Delhi’s base weather station – received 24.8mm of rainfall. It recorded another 28.1mm in the next nine hours, providing much-needed precipitation to the capital, which was in the “large deficient” rainfall category till Tuesday morning. Met officials say more rain is expected on Wednesday, with light to moderate showers expected during the day. Conditions will remain ideal for rain throughout the week, the officials added. “Conditions were favourable for monsoon’s arrival for the last 48 hours. On Tuesday, Delhi finally recorded rainfall. The monsoon has now covered the entire country. Similar rainfall activity is expected on Wednesday, while Thursday and Friday might see isolated drizzles across the city,” said a met official, adding that moderate rainfall was recorded across Delhi during both spells of rain. The IMD classifies rainfall as “light” when it is between 2.5 and 15.5mm, as “moderate” when is it between 15.6 and 64.4mm, while it is classified as “heavy” when it exceeds 64.5mm in a single day. Lodhi road received the most rainfall on Tuesday, recording 19.4mm of rainfall till 8.30am and another 37.8mm in the next nine hours. Palam too recorded “moderate” rainfall, receiving 24.4mm till 8.30am, followed by a spell of 8.2mm in the next nine hours. Delhi had a maximum temperature of only 30.9 degrees Celsius during the day, which is five degrees below normal. The Ridge station recorded the lowest maximum, at just 29.5 degrees Celsius. The IMD forecasts the maximum to hover around 33 degrees Celsius on Wednesday as well, with more rain expected to regulate the temperature and keep it below normal. Till Tuesday, IMD data showed Delhi as a whole had only received 48.9mm of rainfall between June 1 and July 13, as opposed to a normal mark of 140.1mm, making it a deficit of 65%. At Safdarjung, the rain tally during this period was 67.6mm. However, Tuesday’s downpour and another spell on Wednesday is expected to bridge the gap somewhat. IMD data in the last six decades shows that the longest wait for the monsoon to enter Delhi was in 1987, when it reached the capital on July 27, almost a whole month after its normal date. For the last two-three years, the normal date for the monsoon to reach Delhi is June 27. Earlier, the date was June 29. Power cuts were also reported in areas such as Vasant Kunj, Harsh Vihar, Sagarpur, Mahavir Enclave, Badarpur, Karawal Nagar and Lajpat Nagar during the day, however discoms said the impact was temporary. After Tuesday’s rain spell, Delhi’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 80, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Experts say it should improve even further in the next 24 hours, with the rain washing away localised pollutants. Watch Finally!

---||World||WHO: Rich countries should donate vaccines, not use boosters||LONDON: Top officials at the World Health Organization say there's not enough evidence to show that third doses of coronavirus vaccines are needed and appealed Monday for the scarce shots to be shared with poor countries who have yet to immunize their people instead of being used by rich countries as boosters. At a press briefing, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the world's grotesque vaccine disparity was driven by ``greed,'' as he called on drugmakers to prioritize supplying their Covid-19 vaccines to poor countries instead of lobbying rich countries to use even more doses. His plea comes just as pharmaceutical companies are seeking authorization for third doses to be used as boosters in some Western countries, including the US. ``We are making conscious choices right now not to protect those in need,'' Tedros said, adding the immediate priority must be to vaccinate people who have yet to receive a single dose. He called on Pfizer and Moderna to ``go all out to supply COVAX, the Africa Vaccine Acquisition Task Team and low and middle-income countries with very little coverage,'' referring to the U.N.-backed initiative to distribute vaccines globally. After a 10-week drop in global coronavirus deaths, Tedros said the number of Covid-19 patients dying daily is again beginning to climb and that the extremely infectious delta variant is ``driving catastrophic waves of cases.'' Both Pfizer and Moderna have agreed to supply small amounts of their vaccines to COVAX, but the vast majority of their doses have been reserved by rich countries. The UN-backed effort has faltered badly in recent months, with nearly 60 poor countries stalled in their vaccination efforts and their biggest vaccine supplier unable to share any doses until the end of the year. Pfizer met with top US officials on Monday to discuss its plans to seek authorization for a third dose. Last week, the company said the booster could dramatically ramp up immunity and perhaps help ward off worrisome variants even as US health authorities stressed that fully vaccinated Americans are strongly protected and don't need boosters yet. ``Both Pfizer and the US government share a sense of urgency in staying ahead of the virus that causes Covid-19, and we also agree that the scientific data will dictate next steps,'' the company said in a statement late Monday. It's not unusual for manufacturers to brief regulators before filing new data, and a US government spokesperson said the information is just one piece of evidence authorities will use in deciding if, when and for whom a booster might be necessary. Britain is also considering a possible booster vaccination plan in the fall, which would likely target those over 50 and the most vulnerable. But WHO's top experts disputed the need for a booster in fully immunized people. ``At this point ... there is no scientific evidence to suggest that boosters are needed,'' said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, WHO's chief scientist. Swaminathan said WHO would make recommendations on booster doses if they were needed, but that any such advice has to be based on the science and data, not on individual companies declaring that the vaccines should now be administered as a booster dose. Dr Michael Ryan, WHO's emergencies chief, suggested that if rich countries decide to administer booster shots rather than donating them to the developing world, ``we will look back in anger and I think we will look back in shame.'' He said the failure to increase vaccine manufacturing capacity, coupled with rich countries' refusal to share shots with poor countries, was extremely disappointing. This is people who want to have their cake and eat it, he said. Then they make some more cake and they want to eat that as well.'' Some have called the idea of booster shots morally repugnant, given the increased spread of Covid-19 now being seen in some African countries. Tom Hart, the acting CEO of the ONE Campaign, an advocacy group, noted that just 1% of people in poor countries have received even one Covid-19 vaccine dose. The idea that a healthy, vaccinated person can get a booster shot before a nurse or grandmother in South Africa can get a single jab is outrageous, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/who-rich-countries-should-donate-vaccines-not-use-boosters/articleshow/84391734.cms||---
---||World||WHO warns individuals against mixing and matching Covid vaccines||GENEVA: The World Health Organization's chief scientist has advised individuals against mixing and matching Covid-19 vaccines from different manufacturers, saying such decisions should be left to public health authorities. "It's a little bit of a dangerous trend here," Soumya Swaminathan told an online briefing on Monday after a question about booster shots. "It will be a chaotic situation in countries if citizens start deciding when and who will be taking a second, a third and a fourth dose." Swaminathan had called mixing a "data-free zone" but later clarified her remarks in an overnight tweet. "Individuals should not decide for themselves, public health agencies can, based on available data," she said in the tweet. "Data from mix and match studies of different vaccines are awaited - immunogenicity and safety both need to be evaluated." The WHO's strategic advisory group of experts on vaccines said in June the Pfizer vaccine could be used as a second dose after an initial dose of AstraZeneca, if the latter is not available. A clinical trial led by the University of Oxford in the UK is ongoing to investigate mixing the regimen of AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines. The trial was recently expanded to include the Moderna and Novovax vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/who-warns-individuals-against-mixing-and-matching-covid-vaccines/articleshow/84391537.cms||---

The Supreme Court judge also justified the court’s intervention in the Covid vaccination policy. He said the court prima facie found fault in the policy of the Centre for being discriminatory and it could not stand as a “silent spectator” in a humanitarian crisis. He said the court adopted a “bounded deliberative approach” and the policy was changed for the betterment for the citizens. "The criminal law, including anti-terror legislation, should not be misused for quelling dissent or for harassment of citizens. As I noted in Arnab Goswami v. State of Maharashtra and others, our courts must ensure they continue to remain the first line of defence against the deprivation of liberty of citizens,” the Supreme Court judge said. “Deprivation of liberty even for a single day is one too many. We must always be mindful of the deeper systemic implications of our decisions,” Justice Chandrachud said while speaking at the Indo-US Joint Summer Conference on legal ties. Justice Chandrachud, who has passed various judgments to protect personal liberty and freedom, referred to orders by the apex court to protect the rights of the poor and marginalised sections during the Covid pandemic and how the SC's intervention led to change in vaccination policy of the Centre. “The role of the Indian Supreme Court and its involvement in aspects affecting daily lives of the population of India cannot be understated. While being acutely aware of this responsibility, the judges of the Supreme Court of India are careful to maintaining the separation of powers. Many of its interventions have changed the course of Indian history — be it in protecting civil and political liberties which cast a negative obligation on the state or in directing the state to implement socio-economic rights as affirmative obligations under the Constitution,” he said “While some have termed these interventions of the Indian Supreme Court as ‘judicial activism’ or ‘judicial overreach’, the court plays the role of a counter-majoritarian institution,” he said, countering the charge. “It is the court's duty to protect the rights of socio-economic minorities. As the guardian of the Constitution, it has to put a brake where executive or legislative actions infringe on fundamental human rights," Justice Chandrachud said. “...the court’s approach of questioning the rationale of the policy decisions of the government helped in grounding the dialogue between the government and the court regarding the existence of the policy within the constitutional framework," he noted in the case of vaccine policy. The Centre thereafter revised its policy, bearing responsibility of procuring 75% of the vaccines and administering them free of cost to persons above the age of 18 years, while also capping the price that could be charged for the remainder 25% of vaccines, he said.

---||World||After US denied deal, Iran says prisoner swap talks ongoing||TEHRAN: Iran's government spokesman said on Tuesday that talks with the United States about a prisoner exchange are still ongoing, two months after Washington denied an Iranian report that deals had been struck. The official IRNA news agency quoted Cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei as saying the swap negotiations are based on humanitarian interests. "These talks are ongoing and if any acceptable result is achieved, it will be announced,'' he said, without elaborating. Rabiei added that Iran has many times said it is ready to free all prisoners, in return for the release of all Iranian prisoners in custody in the US He added that President joe Biden has focused on the case since taking office. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Tuesday that "indirect but active'' talks with Iran over prisoners have been going on for some time and pre-date the Biden administration. "It is indirect but active discussions taking place to this end: seeing the release of the Americans who have been unjustly detained, deprived of their freedom for far too long now,'' he told reporters in Washington. In early May, a person familiar with the discussions said the US and Iran are in active talks over the release of prisoners but denied a report by Iranian state-run television that deals had been struck. Prisoner swaps between the US and Iran are not uncommon and both countries in recent years have routinely sought the release of detainees. But any movement between them is particularly sensitive as the Biden administration looks to restart nuclear talks. A 2015 atomic accord between the nations included prisoner exchanges. Iran occasionally makes similar statements without any verifiable outcome. Talks in Vienna between Iran and world powers on how to get Tehran and Washington back into the nuclear deal, remain stalled, after six rounds. Tehran insists the US lift all sanctions imposed under former President Donald Trump, including those not related to its nuclear program. Meanwhile, Washington has said Iran needs to comply with all restrictions. Trump pulled Iran unilaterally out of the deal in 2018, saying it needed to be renegotiated. Washington has not been at the table for the Vienna talks, but an American delegation is in the Austrian capital and representatives of the other powers have been shuttling between the American and the Iranian delegation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/after-us-denied-deal-iran-says-prisoner-swap-talks-ongoing/articleshow/84392804.cms||---

---||India||Don’t wait for 3rd wave, try to avert it, says PM Narendra Modi||NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Tuesday said the focus should now be on how to prevent a Covid-19 third wave rather than discussing when it would hit India. The PM’s comments to chief ministers of northeastern states came even as top Union government officials highlighted evidence to show the third wave already forming around the world and stressed the need to immediately step up measures and be vigilant. They said warnings of the third wave were being casually discussed in the manner of weather reports. “It is true tourism and business have been greatly affected due to corona, but today I will say with great emphasis that it is not right to have huge crowds in hill stations and markets without masks,” Modi said during his interaction with the CMs of NE states, which are seeing high positivity rates. Citing examples of countries like the UK, Russia, Bangladesh and Indonesia that are witnessing a surge in daily Covid-19 cases after a decline, the health officials raised concerns over higher number of cases getting reported from across the world. “When we talk about the third wave, we are taking it as a weather update and not understanding its seriousness and our responsibilities associated with it,” joint secretary in health ministry, Lav Agarwal, said at a media briefing. “Higher number of cases are getting reported across the world. This is a matter of serious concern for us. We should understand the trajectory of cases in our country as well as outside, and take precautions accordingly so that the infection is not able to spread again in our country,” Agarwal said. In his interaction, the PM spoke of the need to detect early signals of growing number of cases in some districts and take strict action at the micro level by creating containment zones to avoid further spread. The PM will also interact with CMs of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Maharashtra and Kerala on July 16. “The world is witnessing a third wave. We've to join hands to ensure that third wave doesn't hit India,” Niti Aayog Member Dr V K Paul said, expressing similar worries over people crowding hill stations and markets without observing precautions. The overall daily new cases across the world have increased to 3.9 lakh (July 12), which is nearly 40% of around 9 lakh cases reported on April 29 during the second wave. A distinct rise in cases is also seen in the UK and Russia with over 34,000 and 25,000 daily cases reported respectively following a decline. Neighbouring countries of Bangladesh and Indonesia are also witnessing a serious surge in cases. In India, while overall cases are on a declining trajectory, the government is concerned over some states reporting a rise in number of cases that may result in wider spread in the absence of immediate measures. A total of 31,443 new cases of Covid-19 were recorded from across the country on Monday, taking the total active caseload to over 4.31 lakh cases. Though the government acknowledged the impact of the pandemic on tourism and business, it dismissed the argument that people have been locked up inside their houses for long and therefore want to enjoy before the third wave arrives. Raising concerns over gross violations of Covid norms and people giving excuses to not wear masks and follow physical distancing, the government said it is a continuous fight between the virus and human beings with no scope for complacency. The PM also asked states to speed up vaccinations and rope in celebrities and people from social, religious and educational sectors to encourage people to take the jab. He also underlined the need to establish temporary hospitals due to the geographical situation of the northeast and prepare trained manpower. The PM highlighted the need to augment testing infrastructure in the affected districts on priority to ensure aggressive testing along with random testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dont-wait-for-3rd-wave-try-to-avert-it-says-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/84392836.cms||Sushmi Dey

---||World||Covid surging in Africa with more than 6 million cases||PARIS: Coronavirus is surging in Africa with a record average number of new cases according to an AFP tally based on official sources on Tuesday. It said 6,009,854 cases have been officially counted in Africa's 54 nations and territories since the virus was first discovered in December of 2019 in China. The number of new cases is growing at more than 41,400 per day, a 13% increase over last week and a rate not yet seen on the continent. The number of confirmed cases only reflects a fraction of the actual number of infections, with different countries also having varying counting practices and levels of testing. Lack of testing capacity can mean that statistics are underestimated. The number of new infections has been on the rise in Africa since mid-May. Libya has seen the fastest growth with 1,560 new daily cases, a jump of 260%. Mozambique is second with an average of 1,380 new cases, a 77% increase, and Morocco with 1,190 new cases, a 70% jump. In terms of the total number of new cases detected, South Africa is the most impacted country with 2,219,316 cases. It accounts for 45% of new cases counted on the continent each day. However, the number of new daily cases in South Africa has been decreasing in recent days, down 6% with 18,340 average daily cases. The country reached it's peak between July 2 and 8 when a daily average of 19,956 cases was reported. After South Africa, Tunisia is the second country with the most new cases with 7,820 cases per day on average, an increase of 47%. With the Delta variant highly present in the country, the World Health Organization told AFP that "the health situation is serious and all indicators are red". In general, Africa suffers from an unequal distribution of vaccines across the world. Per 100 inhabitants only about 4 doses have been given across the continent while in Europe, nearly 72 have been administered according to an AFP tally based on official sources. On a global level the pandemic is subsiding only in Latin America and the Caribbean where contaminations are down 7% compared to last week. In Europe new cases are up by 25%, 22% in the Middle East, 17% in Asia and 97% in the US.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/covid-surging-in-africa-with-more-than-6-million-cases/articleshow/84393138.cms||---

Till Tuesday night, deaths during the second wave had crossed 2.54 lakh, if March 1 is taken as the start of the wave. Prior to March 1, in what can be loosely termed the first Covid wave in India, a little more than 1.57 lakh deaths had been recorded. India has so far reported 4,11,435 deaths from the virus. Several states are now adding to their tallies “backlog” deaths – Covid fatalities that had occurred earlier in the second wave but went unacknowledged. As a result, the toll has continued to be relatively high even though daily deaths have been falling. On Monday, for instance, Madhya Pradesh reported 1,481 old Covid deaths. In the last 10 days, India's Covid toll has risen by nearly 10,000 (9,733), of which more than a third (3,580) have been backlog deaths. The toll in the previous 10 days was nearly the same – 10,478, with 2,133 backlog fatalities. Meanwhile, India reported more than 39,000 fresh cases on Tuesday, a day after reporting 30,557 new infections, the lowest daily tally in 118 days. Tuesday's case count stood at 39,086, with Delhi's data yet to come in till midnight. There were 624 deaths reported on the day, up from 446 on the previous day (not counting backlog fatalities). Kerala continued to lead the case count, with 14,539 fresh infections reported in the last 24 hours. The state accounted for more than a third of the national tally. Maharashtra reported 7,243 new cases, the lowest number since June 28, raising hope that the persistently high infection levels in the state could be finally receding. However, Maharashtra and Kerala together continued to account for a lion’s share of new cases in the country, over 55% on Tuesday. Maharashtra reported 196 deaths, by far the highest toll in the country. There were 124 deaths in Kerala while Odisha reported as many as 68 fatalities, which include previous deaths being reconciled with the toll. Kerala too has been reconciling old deaths in the tally. However, unlike Maharashtra, which has been issuing a separate count of old fatalities, Odisha and Kerala have not been providing such a break-up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-toll-in-second-wave-tops-2-5-lakh/articleshow/84393269.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

Amid the hectic activities, Sidhu’s tweet saying that AAP “has always recognised my work” triggered speculation if it was another bare-knuckle attempt by him to push the party into accepting his demand to be made the state unit chief. Replying to AAP’s challenge, Sidhu said, “Our opposition AAP has always recognised my vision & work for Punjab. Be it before 2017- Beadbi (sacrilege), Drugs, Farmers Issues, Corruption & Power Crisis faced by People of Punjab raised by me or today as I present ‘Punjab Model’, it is clear they know - who is really fighting for Punjab.” He posted videos of AAP leaders praising him in the past. Congress general secretary in charge of Punjab Harish Rawat on Tuesday met Rahul Gandhi and announced that “good news would be coming for Punjab Congress in 3-4 days”, suggesting that the party was ready to make a final stab at settling the infighting and lobbying that has roiled the election-bound state for several weeks. Rawat’s remark came in the backdrop of intense negotiations by the cricketer-turned politician for the post of state president, a move that is strongly opposed by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh. Sources said Sidhu is the front-runner for the post of state president. Even as events were playing out, political strategist Prashant Kishor, who is advisor to the Punjab CM, met Rahul Gandhi. However, Rawat said the Kishor-Rahul meeting was not about Punjab, adding that “many people meet Rahul with their views while Rahul too takes inputs from different individuals”. Reports said Kishor met Rahul, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Sonia Gandhi about 2024 elections and the planning ahead, like the opposition front. Rawat’s meeting with Rahul was said to have included AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who has taken keen interest in Punjab affairs besides emerging as a backer of Sidhu. Congress claimed Sidhu had only uploaded a 2017 video of AAP leader Bhagwant Mann praising him, in response to Mann’s challenge. Mann tweeted that political donations from power companies to Congress were the reason why the power purchase agreements in the state were not cancelled by the Amarinder Singh government, and challenged Sidhu to tweet about them. Given the muddied political waters in Punjab and Sidhu’s aggressive lobbying during the last two months in which he has also secured the backing of Priyanka, there is suddenly a buzz that Sidhu may have his wish fulfilled, a far cry from the estimates till now that the possibility was ruled out. But party sources said that if Sidhu‘s wish was to be accepted, then CM Singh will have to be on board so that he does not throw a fit. A possible way out in that situation would be that Sidhu be appointed the PCC chief with three working presidents from Hindu communities, while the CM is upfront declared as the party mascot for the 2022 polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/navjot-sidhus-aap-tweet-stokes-buzz-prashant-kishor-meets-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/84393720.cms||---

Gawande, an author of four New York Times best-selling books and a professor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School and the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, will be nominated to be the assistant administrator of USAID's Bureau for Global Health. His role at USAID will focus on efforts to prevent child and maternal deaths, control the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and combat infectious diseases, such as Covid-19, the official said. Gawande appears to be taking his advice. Last month, he told advanced degree graduates at Stanford University to be "open to trying stuff – to saying yes” to new opportunities. Gawande, an outspoken critic of his industry's practices, was hired in 2018 by Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Amazon.com Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co to lead Haven, a joint healthcare company aimed at cutting costs for U.S. employees. But the Boston-based venture was short-lived and shut down in February.

Ursula von der Leyen said in an interview with Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung that even though a dozen European carmakers had already announced they would switch to zero-emissions cars between 2028 and 2035, a legal cut-off date was still needed. "We will still set out an end date after which, all cars will have to be emissions free," she said, without naming that date. "Otherwise there will be a lack of certainty and we won't achieve our goal of climate neutrality by 2050." The European Commission on Wednesday unveils its "Fit for 50" package of proposals which, if approved by the 27 member states, would put the bloc - the world's third-largest economy - on track to meet its 2030 goal of reducing planet-warming emissions by 55% from 1990 levels. The package being released will face months of negotiations between member states and the European Parliament and is likely to be the target of ferocious lobbying efforts by the many industries affected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/eu-will-introduce-cut-off-date-for-combustion-cars-commission-head/articleshow/84393496.cms||---

The court warned that due diligence or at least a “preliminary inquiry into facts” was necessary before anyone posts “messages on a social media platform, made accessible to all members of the public, against any person.” Justice C Hari Shankar’s observations came while directing Saket Gokhale to immediately delete alleged defamatory tweets against former diplomat Lakshmi Murdeshwar Puri. The court also restrained him from posting any more “scandalous” tweets against her and her husband, Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri. Referring to the ease with which anyone could be vilified online, the court noted, “All that is needed is the opening of a social media account and, thereafter, posting of messages. Thousands of responses are received and, in the process, the reputation of the man, who is targeted, becomes mud.” It underlined that the “reputations, nourished and nurtured over years of selfless service and toil, may crumble in an instant; one thoughtless barb is sufficient.” The court also rejected Gokhale’s claim that a person had no responsibility to reach out to the subject or verify facts before posting it on social media. “Such a submission, if accepted, would place the reputation of every citizen in serious jeopardy, and open to ransom at the hands of every social media vigilante, some of whose intentions may be less than honourable. This is even more so in the case of public figures, whose actions are, as a matter of course, subjected to intensive and invasive dissection by all members of the public,” the court said. It said, if Gokhale failed to delete the tweets within 24 hours, Twitter should take them down. Justice Shankar noted that, “Social media, for all its unquestionable and undeniable benefits, as well as its indispensability in modern times, comes with its own sordid sequelae.” It was hearing a defamation suit filed by Puri, a former assistant secretary-general at the United Nations, against whom Gokhale tweeted on June 13 and 26 and referred to certain property purchased by her in Switzerland. In her suit Lakshmi Puri had sought Rs 5 crore in damages from Gokhale and an immediate removal of the tweets, contending that these were false and factually incorrect, per-se defamatory and slanderous against her and her family. The court also issued summons to Gokhale on the main suit and directed him to file his written statement within four weeks and listed the case before the joint registrar on September 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ruining-reputation-is-now-childs-play-delhi-high-court/articleshow/84393965.cms||Abhinav Garg

The "dark web" page of the group known as REvil disappeared some two weeks after an attack which crippled networks of hundreds of companies worldwide and prompted a ransom demand of $70 million. "REvil has seemingly vanished from the dark web, as its website has gone offline," tweeted Allan Liska, a security researcher with the firm Recorded Future, who noted that the site had been unresponsive from around 5:00 am GMT. The news comes after US President Joe Biden repeated a warning to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin late last week about harboring cybercriminals while suggesting Washington could take action in the face of growing ransomware attacks. Analysts in the past have suggested that the US military's Cyber Command has the capability to strike back at hackers in the face of threats to national security, but there was no official word on any such action. "The situation is still unfolding, but evidence suggests REvil has suffered a planned, concurrent takedown of their infrastructure, either by the operators themselves or via industry or law enforcement action," John Hultquist of Mandiant Threat Intelligence said in an emailed statement. "If this was a disruption operation of some kind, full details may never come to light." Brett Callow of the security firm Emsisoft also pointed to unanswered questions. "Whether the outage is the result of action taken by law enforcement is unclear," Callow said. "If law enforcement has managed to disrupt the gang's operations, that would obviously be a good thing, but could create problems for any companies whose data is currently encrypted. They'd not have the option of paying REvil for the key needed to decrypt their data." James Lewis, head of technology and public policy at the Washington-based Center for Strategic & International Studies, said the site may be down for a number of reasons including pressure from Russian authorities. "I don't think it was us," he said. Liska noted that the site's ownership had not been changed, making a domain seizure less likely. "This could suggest these are self-directed takedowns (too early to tell)," he said. The unprecedented attack targeting the US software firm Kaseya affected an estimated 1,500 businesses. The Kaseya attack, which was reported on July 2, shut down a major Swedish supermarket chain and ricocheted around the world, impacting businesses in at least 17 countries, from pharmacies to gas stations, as well as dozens of New Zealand kindergartens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/ransomware-gang-goes-offline-prompting-questions/articleshow/84394039.cms||---
---||India||UP population policy may put the poor at a disadvantage||NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh’s proposed population policy might promise to take care of all communities, but the immediate adverse effect of the disincentives under the policy is likely to be felt by the poorest in the most deprived communities — scheduled tribes, scheduled castes and Muslims — and the immediate advantage of the incentives could be primarily to the well-off among the upper caste. The draft of the proposed policy says violators or those with more than two children would be barred from contesting local elections, applying for government jobs or getting subsidies under government welfare schemes. Government employees with more children than the norm would be barred from promotion. Available data on fertility levels suggests the brunt of these punitive measures will be borne by the underprivileged. This is no surprise as it is well established in public health that socioeconomic development is the biggest determinant of fertility. Data from the National Family Healthy Survey done in 2019-20 (NFHS-5) has not yet been released for Uttar Pradesh. But going by NFHS-4 data of 2015-16, the fertility rate (or the total number of children born to a woman) for all categories except “others”, which is mostly upper castes, is three or more. The fertility rate of scheduled castes was 3.1, of scheduled tribes 3.6, that of OBC 2.8 while for ‘others’ it was 2.3. Scheduled castes comprise roughly 21% of the state’s population and Muslims about 20%, while scheduled tribes are a negligible 0.1% of the population. Religion-wise, the fertility of Hindus was 2.7 in 2015-16 and that of Muslims was 3.1. While fertility would have gone down a little across all communities, since the total fertility of the state came down from 3.1 in 2016 to 2.9 in 2018 according to SRS data, the relative difference is unlikely to have changed much. The NFHS-4 data on birth order showed that the highest proportion of births which were third, fourth or higher order children (61.5%) was among women with no schooling. This reduced steadily with the increasing education level of women — 49% among women who had completed five years of schooling, 36.4% among those who completed 5-9 years of schooling and about 25% among those who completed 10-11 years of schooling. The lowest proportion of births of the third or fourth child or beyond was among women who had completed 12 years of schooling, just 13%, reflecting a well-established finding that fertility reduces with increasing level of education of parents, especially the mother. UP is fifth from the bottom when it comes to literacy according to the latest National Statistical Office report of 2017-18 with just 63.4% of women being literate. Among religious groups, Muslims have the lowest literacy level, just 37% of Muslim women in the 2011 census. Higher fertility has been established as a feature of poor socio-economic development or deprivation. This is borne out by the proportion of women in different caste groups who had a third or fourth child in the three years preceding the NFHS. It was 47% among tribals, 46% among Dalits, 41% among OBCs and 36.5% among ‘others’. It was over 50% among Muslims, 39% among Hindus and barely 15% among Sikhs, the most affluent among religious groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-population-policy-may-put-the-poor-at-a-disadvantage/articleshow/84394141.cms||Rema Nagarajan

Colombia is in the midst of it's worst outbreak of violence since a 2016 peace deal ended decades of armed conflict. Dissident FARC rebels who refused to lay down arms, still-active ELN guerillas, armed drug-trafficking groups and rightwing paramilitaries are all battling for control of lucrative cocaine and illegal mining zones. Displacement rates today were approaching those of the 1990's, at the height of Colombia's internal conflict, said the Defensora del Pueblo. In total, 44,290 people had to flee between January and June this year, compared to 13,912 in the same period of 2020. The situation today was "identical or similar" to that in the 1990's, said official Carlos Camargo. At that time, paramilitary groups attacked areas held by the FARC in a spiral of violence that left Colombia with the world's highest number of displaced people. Some eight million people were displaced in the near six-decade conflict. The problem today is worst in the rural areas, particularly in border regions where drug trafficking is rife and residents get caught up in fighting between armed gangs and soldiers, said the ombudsman. Colombia is the world's major cocaine exporter, with the United States being it's biggest consumer. The Defensora del Pueblo also highlighted a lesser-known problem of communities, particularly indigenous people and Afro-Colombians, being confined to their villages. More than 36,000 people were confined in the first six months of 2021 for fear of their lives, the forced recruitment of minors or the presence of antipersonnel mines, it said. Colombia's military said on Tuesday that three soldiers were killed and five injured in fighting with FARC dissidents in the country's southwest. The clashes occurred as troops were accompanying displaced families back home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/violence-in-colombia-drives-rise-in-displacements/articleshow/84394275.cms||---
---||World||Biden decries 'big lie,' but offers no new path on voting rights bill||PHILADELPHIA: President Joe Biden, under pressure from US civil rights leaders, on Tuesday called it a "national imperative" to pass sweeping voting rights legislation that has stalled in Congress but did not outline a path to overcome Republican opposition. Numerous Republican-controlled states have passed new voting restrictions this year, a push encouraged by Biden's Republican predecessor Donald Trump. In a passionate speech in a city considered the nation's birthplace, Biden, without naming him, took aim at Trump and his supporters for false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from the Republican former president through widespread voting fraud. "So hear me clearly: there's an unfolding assault taking place in America today, an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote in fair and free elections," Biden told a cheering crowd in Philadelphia. "The Big Lie is just that: a big lie," Biden said, referring to unfounded election fraud claims by Trump and his allies. "In America, if you lose you accept the results, you follow the Constitution. You try again. You don't call facts fake and try to bring down the American experiment just because you're unhappy. That's not statesmanship. It's selfishness," Biden added. Republicans must "stand up, for God's sake," and oppose voting restrictions, Biden said, adding a challenge: "Have you no shame?" The voting rights legislation faces an uphill battle in Congress, where Biden's fellow Democrats have been stymied by Senate Republicans who blocked it even from being debated. Biden's focus on the subject, even if the legislation fails, enables him to rally Democratic voters as his party works to maintain control of Congress in the 2022 midterm elections. Biden made a searing critique of what he called efforts to undermine voting rights, likening them to past laws that prevented Black people and women from voting in the United States. "They want to make it so hard ... that they hope people don't vote at all. That's what this is about," Biden said of those efforts. "We must pass the 'For the People Act.' It's a national imperative," Biden added, referring to the legislation. According to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, at least 17 states this year have enacted laws that restrict voting access, with more being considered. Biden's party and civil rights groups have opposed these restrictions, which critics have said are aimed at Black, Hispanic and younger voters, who have helped elect Democrats. Many Republicans have justified new restrictions as a means to combat voter fraud, a phenomenon that election experts have said is rare in the United States. Two of the nation's foundational documents, the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution, were signed at Independence Hall, just steps away from the National Constitution Center where Biden made his speech. The filibusterBiden did not announce a new position on a Senate custom called the filibuster under which most legislation cannot advance without the support of 60 members of the 100-seat chamber. The Senate is split 50-50 between the parties, with Democrats in control because Vice President Kamala Harris can cast a tie-breaking vote. Some advocates want Biden to back an arrangement that would prevent the filibuster from blocking the voting rights bill. Biden, who served in the Senate for decades, has resisted calling for ending the filibuster. Civil rights leader Al Sharpton noted to Reuters after the speech that Biden did not mention the filibuster, and said he had just spoken to the president. "And he said to me just now, Al, we're still working through where we are going to be on that. He's not committed yet." If passed, the Democratic-backed bill would expand opportunities to cast ballots before Election Day, make certain campaign contributions more transparent and change the process for drawing the boundaries of House of Representatives districts. Republicans said the measure violates the authority of states to set their own election laws. "After Democrats failed to pass their federal takeover of our elections. Biden is continuing their dishonest attacks on commonsense election integrity efforts," Republican National Committee spokesperson Danielle Álvarez said. "Meanwhile, Republicans are engaged in state-led efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat, and polling shows Americans overwhelmingly support these laws." Biden met last week with civil rights leaders who prodded him to keep fighting for voting rights despite Republican resistance. In Texas on Monday, more than 50 Democratic legislators left that state in a bid to derail Republican efforts to pass voting restrictions. The Democratic legislators said on Tuesday they plan to stay in Washington as long as needed to derail the state legislation and push for federal voting reform. Harris told Reuters the Texas lawmakers showed "great courage." She met with them after Biden's speech.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-decries-big-lie-but-offers-no-new-path-on-voting-rights-bill/articleshow/84394209.cms||---

All eyes on Rahul Gandhi||NEW DELHI: All eyes are on the Congress parliamentary strategy group meeting called by party president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday evening, with insiders watching if Rahul Gandhi will agree to lead Congress in Lok Sabha and shed his reluctance to assume leadership positions and fill the vacuum at the top. It is hotly speculated that Congress will go into the monsoon session of Parliament starting next week with a new leader in place of Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.

Official sources said Jaishankar is expected to emphasise on the need for an early, complete and sincere disengagement at the LAC in eastern Ladakh for improvement in ties that have been marred since April last year. The two will also talk about the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan where the Taliban insurgents are threatening to sweep across the country as the US withdraws hastily. Jaishankar and Wang will also participate on Wednesday in the SCO Afghanistan Contact Group meeting. Jaishankar and Wang have twice spoken this year — in February and April. They discussed the status of LAC disengagement and implementation of the Moscow agreement and also agreed to establish a hotline for timely communication. India has repeatedly emphasised on the need to implement the Moscow agreement that refers to the 5-point consensus Jaishankar and Wang arrived at last year, again on the margins of an SCO meeting, to resolve the border situation. While Russia has refrained from making any offer to mediate between India and China, it has repeatedly said the SCO platform should be used by member-countries to resolve differences between them. India and China completed disengagement in the Pangong Tso area in February this year but there’s been little headway at remaining friction points. While China continues to blame India’s alleged troop build-up for the LAC stand-off, India says Beijing’s violation of bilateral agreements is the reason for the border strife. Jaishankar will also come face to face in Dushanbe with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi but sources said there was no proposal yet for a bilateral meeting between them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/s-jaishankar-likely-to-have-bilateral-meet-with-chinese-counterpart/articleshow/84394873.cms||---

Law minister Basavaraj Bommai had on Monday said a decision will be taken after extensive discussions on the subject. The UP draft proposes to debar those having more than two children from contesting civic polls, applying for government jobs and availing subsidies. Also, it seeks to give promotions, increments, concessions in housing schemes and other perks to other employees. It also seeks to reduce maternal and infant deaths in a time-bound manner, besides ensuring better management of education, health and nutrition of those in the 11-19 age group. BJP national general secretary CT Ravi urged the state to bring in a similar population control policy. Assam, another BJP-ruled state, has announced it will gradually implement a two-child policy. Gujarat has started studying the pros and cons of the draft bill. KPCC chief DK Shivakumar refused to give importance to Ravi’s statement. “He’s a national leader and has a lot of national issues to tackle. Let the BJP government table the population control bill in the assembly, and then we will take it up.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-hints-at-population-policy-set-to-study-up-model/articleshow/84394771.cms||---

The discoms are given freedom to seek revision of the tariff based on quarterly returns to be filed by them instead of annual returns. Based on the requests filed by the Eastern Power Distribution Company Limited (EPDCL) and Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (SPDCL), APERC issued a gazette notification by bringing in an amendment to the principal regulation in the Act. The discoms requested the ERC to allow them to opt for quarterly FPPCA instead of annual returns. In the existing system, the discoms were filing petitions before the ERC seeking collection of true-up charges from the consumers based on the expenditure incurred on fuel and power purchase on annual basis. With the delay in completion of the process, the discoms were going for collection of true-up charges during the next fiscal. With a view to collecting the true-up charges almost in the ongoing fiscal, the discoms requested ERC to make changes in the Act to file the returns on quarterly basis. “Within two months from the completion of the quarter in the financial year, the discom shall file application for FPPCA. The filing shall be accompanied by purchase details source-wise for the quarter along with monthly break-up,” said ERC. It further said that the commission would clear the petitions of discoms after prudent check and public hearings. ERC directed the discoms that they would have to return to the consumers in case the costs determined by the commission were lower than the actual tariff. It said that the distribution licensees would be allowed to pass on the variations in the fuel costs based only on the actual bills admitted by it from the approved sources (excluding purchases from the exchanges) for a quarter on its own, subject to a ceiling of 50 paise/unit as per the formula specified in the regulation to all categories (except agriculture consumers). ERC said discoms would claim upward revision of charges on agriculture connections from the government instead of consumers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/discoms-can-revise-tariff-on-quarterly-basis/articleshow/84387068.cms||---

Parents are finding it hard to introduce their kids to the outside world. Even children are missing their school friends or interaction with a large number of people and nature. Mother of a toddler, Sukanya Singh, said she is worried for her daughter who starts crying when she sees people. “My daughter was about five months old when the lockdown was imposed in our country. For nearly six to seven months, I did not move her out. But when Covid cases started decreasing after the first wave, I took her to a nearby park. She started screaming and crying after seeing people around her. Even I got nervous to see how she was behaving,” said Singh. Many parents like Singh are facing similar problems. Hena Mehmood, whose daughter has turned three, said she felt sad for her baby who has no friends till now. “She plays alone with the toys or with elders in the family. Though I spend time with her, I feel she needs a peer group.” Experts say quarantine has had a physiological burden on children and several of them are suffering from anxiety, restlessness, fear of the virus and boredom, apart from the fact that their mental growth is getting impacted. Psychiatrist Mahwaish Fatima, who has also worked as a counsellor for children in a private city school, said the quarantine has led to children spending more time on the digital screen and has limited their physical activities. “We do get complaints from parents about kids glued to the mobile phones more than they used to before the Covid-19 pandemic. Even classes are being held online and this is automatically increasing their screen time. Several complaints of change in sleep pattern have also been reported. Not only children, even elders in the family have changed their routine as many of them do not have to go to office and kids are following the same,” Fatima said. Associate professor of psychiatry at NMCH, Dr Santosh Kumar said many parents are not carefully monitoring their kids’ behaviour, which otherwise they should. “Effect of quarantine can be seen even in the future when these kids grow up. They may be on the lower side of emotional quotient (EQ) and social quotient (SQ). Even if they are performing well on the academic front, they will struggle in personal life,” he said. Dr Kumar said children in nuclear families are suffering more and advised parents to allow mixing with relatives and neighbours while following the Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Children should have an empathetic attitude,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-say-prolonged-indoor-stay-adversely-affects-kids-mental-health/articleshow/84384641.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Several questions raised by the opposition MLAs in the assembly to the government regarding the case are yet to be answered by the government, the assembly records show. Even those questions which have been raised during the tenure of the previous government, are still pending for being answered. On January 20 this year, MLAs including opposition leader V D Satheesan, Roji M John, Anwar Sadath, T J Vinod, Eldhos P Kunappillil and Anil Akkara had asked nine questions (three unstarred questions with sub-questions) to the chief minister regarding the case. The questions include whether the chief minister had written to the prime minister regarding the gold smuggling, whether he had asked for a probe into the case by multiple agencies, whether the government feels if the agencies are undertaking an impartial probe, in which post was the second accused in the case, Swapna Prabha Suresh, appointed in the Space Park under the IT department, what was the salary offered to her etc. Similarly, there were questions regarding the case that were even raised in the assembly session held last month, after the new government took charge. These, including a question from a ruling front MLA, have also been left unanswered. CPM MLA C H Kunhambu had asked whether the government intends to go ahead with any legal action against the enforcement directorate, and if it has come to the notice of the government regarding the media reports that the agency is threatening the accused in the case to depose against the public activists of the state. Similar questions regarding the case were also raised by MLAs P T Thomas, N Shamshuddin and I C Balakrishnan on the same day, none of which have been answered. “There are several questions in this subject pending to be answered by the government. We will take it up with the speaker in the upcoming session of the assembly. It is the right of the members to get answers for the questions raised in the house,” said MLA Roji M John. “It has been insisted that the delayed answers should be filed along with a delay statement in the assembly in the same session, or at the latest, on the first day of the next session. Even this timeframe is not met in some cases,” sources in the legislature secretariat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-evades-queries-on-gold-smuggling/articleshow/84388853.cms||KP Saikiran

It was one less than Monday’s. The state reported 7,243 cases and 196 deaths, taking the total caseload to 61.7 lakh and fatalities to 1,26,220. After many days, the state did not add any unreported deaths to the cumulative toll. A day earlier, the state had reported 53 deaths. According to the daily BMC update, 30,100 tests were carried out in a 24-hour period resulting in 454 cases being detected.

It also said that even if peak margin is raised to 100%, as is scheduled from September 1 this year under a Sebi mandate, ANMI petitioned the regulator to allow investors to pay only 50% of the margin while brokers pay the balance 50%. Earlier, ANMI had submitted to Sebi a detailed presentation about the impact of margins on trading in Bank Nifty, one of the most popular products in the derivatives segment of NSE, which showed that the peak margin of between 25% and 33% provides adequate safety for the market. Given this, ANMI feels a 50% margin on investors could be more than enough to reduce trading risks in the market. The presentation had also pointed out that imposing a 100% peak margin could have an adverse effect on behaviour of traders in the market. These include behavioural change in trading pattern, longer or deeper stop losses, conversion of low-risk day trades to high-risk positional trades, booking of trades that bring in profit but carry forward of trades that incur losses and switch to options buying to extract leverage. Privately, brokers said that a peak margin at 100% level could actually increase losses rather than minimising the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/anmi-approaches-sebi-to-reduce-peak-margin-to-50/articleshow/84390556.cms||---

Congress legislative party leader Ajit Sharma said his party legislators will move to different places and inform people about the drawbacks of Prime Minister Narendra Modi led-NDA government at the Centre and chief minister Nitish Kumar-led government in the state. Sharma said they have planned to visit entire Bihar in the next eight months, starting with blocks, panchayats and then moving to villages. “Ten new members will be made in each village. Our legislators will talk on the issue of unemployment, dilapidated health system and how people suffered during the Covid-19 pandemic. People have been made a fool by PM Modi and we have to tell them the truth. We have to make the young generation realise that they have been deceived.” CLP leader said this is the beginning of preparation for 2024 Lok Sabha elections. “During our recent meeting with our leader Rahul Gandhi, I had asked him to give us eight months time to strengthen the party in Bihar. We have also urged him to review the progress after every three months.” Sharma said during their visit to different places, they will be also screening dedicated party workers, suitable for Lok Sabha candidature. He accepted that Congress had given tickets to several candidates in assembly election without doing any ground work. “We will not repeat that again. Though we got 70 seats, many were such where we did not have any strong base,” Sharma after meeting Rahul Gandhi in Delhi, had also met RJD supremo Lalu Prasad and discussed the discrepancies in ticket distribution. He said they will now be taking those seats where they have chances of winning. Cong demonstration:Members of Patna Mahanagar Congress Committee demonstrated near Ashiyana Mor on Tuesday against the skyrocketing fuel price, edible oil and commodities of every day use. This was their fifth day of agitation and they demanded the NDA government to roll back the prices of fuel.While addressing the public and party members at the demonstration site, committee president Shashi Ranjan lashed out at the NDA government for not controlling the price rise, which he said had become unbearable for common people. “Covid-19 pandemic has already affected the life of common man and price rise has further worsened the situation,” said Ranjan adding, “Even BJP leaders are aware of the situation, but are mute spectators.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cong-mass-contact-prog-from-next-mnth/articleshow/84387874.cms||Sheezan Nezami

In a circular, director of education D R Bhagat also said that school staff should ensure that their family members are vaccinated. CM Pramod Sawant had said last week that expert members of the task force had recommended priority vaccination of school teaching and non-teaching staff, to safeguard children from Covid-19 infection ahead of the third wave. “Now, it is informed that in the interest of the health of the students, all teaching and non-teaching staff of schools should get vaccinated urgently without any further delay. The staff who do not get vaccinated for any reason by then, must submit an RT-PCR report, possibly weekly, to attend to their duties in the school,” the circular states. The directorate has said that those teachers who do not get themselves vaccinated will have to produce a medical certificate to state why they need to be exempted from taking the jab. “Those who cannot produce this test report must produce a recommendation of medical experts if they have exemption for such a report for any reason,” the circular reads. “The teaching and non-teaching staff members must also ensure that their family members are also vaccinated without any further delay, as a precaution to prevent any transmission through them,” the DoE has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/get-jab-or-produce-rt-pcr-every-wk-school-staff-told/articleshow/84391122.cms||---

The firm was appointed in 2017 as the consultant for preparation of detailed project reports and detailed cost estimates for refurbishment and conversion of INS Viraat into a multipurpose tourism destination with a hotel-cum-convention centre and naval maritime museum. However, the project was shelved due to various reasons. The state government already paid Rs 31.86 lakh out of the Rs 70.8 lakh professional fee (including 18% GST) and has sanctioned the remaining amount on Tuesday. The state government showed keen interest to turn INS Viraat into a major tourist hub by placing it in Visakhapatnam or some other coastal city. But due to various reasons, the project has not made any headway. INS Viraat, the second Centaur-class aircraft carrier in service which spent 30 years in the Indian Navy and 27 years in the Royal Navy, was decommissioned in March 2017. A private organisation purchased the ship for Rs 35 crore and started dismantling it.

---||Business||Why influence PNB Housing’s meeting: SAT to Sebi||MUMBAI: The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Tuesday pulled up markets regulator Sebi for trying to pre-empt the outcome of the PNB Housing Finance shareholders’ meeting on June 22. Questioning Sebi’s decision to halt an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of PNB Housing, the tribunal asked whether it was fair for the regulator to step in before the shareholders took a decision and if it thought that they were “dummies”. The tribunal was hearing an appeal by PNB Housing against Sebi’s decision to stall a Rs 4,000-crore preferential allotment to private equity investors led by Carlyle. Sebi had said that the process was not consistent with the company’s articles of association and asked the firm to undertake a valuation exercise. The tribunal adjourned the hearing to Friday at the request of Sebi’s advocate. Pointing out that the first question to be addressed was at what stage can Sebi step in, the tribunal said that the regulator could have passed an order after the EGM. Sebi’s advocate argued that the allotment would result in a change in control and consequently an open offer. He said that the price of shares in the preferential issue would also have a bearing on the open offer price and result in small investors being short-changed. Sebi’s counsel cited the letter written by PNB to its subsidiary, asking it to abide by the articles of association. Last month, Sebi had written two letters to PNB Housing, one to the company to put on hold its scheduled EGM on June 22. This was allowed by SAT, but it asked the company not to announce the voting outcome. The other one was on June 25 that asked all the directors on its board to explain why they allowed the process and pricing of the preferential allotment to Carlyle, which is alleged to have flouted the law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sat-to-sebi-why-influence-pnb-housings-meeting/articleshow/84389875.cms||---

A study carried out by CEPT University students revealed that the number is merely 12%. Against this, 27%, which is more than double of those using public transport, use two-wheelers. As the second phase of metro goes on full swing, the study aimed to understand issues related to public transport. More so, the bigger challenge of how to convert population using twowheeler, three-wheeler and four-wheeler into public transport users. The study titled ‘Improving Public Transport in Ahmedabad’ by Shravya N is part of the ongoing Summer Exhibition by CEPT University put up virtually this year. It was part of a larger study on strategic plan for urban transport taught by Shalini Sinha and Nikita Bhakuni. The study took into consideration modes of transport use data collected in 2019-20 and tried to imagine public transport scenario two decades ahead in 2041. The study projected the rise of public transport users from existing 12% to 30% with metro getting added in the mix. The study argued that in order to promote a more robust public transport use by citizens like in bigger metro cities, Ahmedabad requires calibrating the existing network to emerging housing and industrial clusters. It identified Gandhinagar, GIFT City, Odhav, Vatva, Changodar, Bopal, DFC Corridor and Santej as such clusters in and around the city. Shalini Sinha, associate professor and executive director of the Center of Excellence in Urban Transport (CoE-UT) at CEPT University, said the study looks at existing and future prospects of public transport. “With rise in vehicular population, the city is bound to fall back on public transport, and we need to plan for it. The study – based on the projections of the city and periphery’s growth – identified growth centres and suggested ways to connect the existing bus and train network for more traction,” she said. “The takeaway is improving trip time, quality of transport and addressing last-mile connectivity.” In an insight into why Amdavadis travel, the study indicated 47% of respondents said they travel for work, whereas the other 34% travelled for education. Only 1% said they were travelling for social purposes, and another 2% for recreation||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/only-12-of-abad-uses-public-transport/articleshow/84390065.cms||Parth Shastri

The Convergence Energy Services Limited, a Union government entity, signed an agreement on Tuesday with New & Renewable Energy Development Corporation of Andhra Pradesh to provide 25,000 electric two-wheelers. The state government has already created a separate sub-category for electric vehicles and the electricity tariff has been fixed at Rs 6.70 per unit. State energy minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy that the energy department is providing affordable and clean power to give a fillip to e-mobility. “The procurement of 25,000 electric vehicles will give a further push towards clean energy adoption. This would boost energy and financial savings,” said Reddy. Under the agreement CESL and NREDCAP will work to aggregate demand, deploy electric vehicles, and build charging infrastructure. CESL will devise a suitable payment security mechanism, which will be facilitated by the NREDCAP. Energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said that providing the 25,000 electric vehicles for government employees will be a game-changer for e-mobility in the state. “Apart from mitigating climate change, electric mobility is going to be a key economic growth driver. We are determined to develop an e-mobility ecosystem in the state. We will encourage all government employees including cooperative societies, public sector undertakings, village, ward secretariat staff and others to opt for EVs. A bigger fleet of EVs in the government will encourage greater uptake among the masses,” said Srikant. MD & CEO, CESL, Mahua Acharya, said, “Andhra Pradesh’s decision to go electric will accelerate e-mobility adoption in the country, hopefully providing a blueprint for other states to adopt. We are delighted to partner with NREDCAP.” The electric two-wheelers will be provided on a monthly lease that will be inclusive of a comprehensive insurance which will be deducted as EMI from the volunteering government employee’s account. The electric two-wheeler will carry a standard warranty of three years against any manufacturing defect. Batteries too will carry a warranty of three years or 60,000 kilometres, whichever is earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-turns-to-evs-for-govt-staff-in-e-mobility-push/articleshow/84387034.cms||---

The new environment is characterised by an increasingly complex set of pressures from various stakeholder groups, heightened expectations of societal-engagement corporate citizenship, and radical uncertainty about the future. Never before had the boards needed to balance providing support to the management teams, who were operating in highly stressful conditions, with challenging them to ensure that they make the best decisions throughout the crisis, for which no rule book exists. Such situations have exposed the board’s ability to deal with crises — displaying its strength or crumbling under pressure. The current pandemic, which has challenged businesses like never before, has got organisations thinking about the quality of their boards. Today, what companies are looking for is to bring independent directors who have dealt with unprecedented situations and who can also challenge conventional thinking. The insights of such directors can help constructively challenge business continuity plans — since they can be good advisers as well as sounding boards — as management teams craft plans and strategies during these VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) times. The emerging role of boards in today’s dynamically uncertain environment is: * Leadership succession: Many boards put leadership succession on hold during turbulent times, even if it was high on the agenda before the crisis hit. Postponing a CEO transition in the midst of a downturn creates its own risks. The best boards prepare to initiate change at the right moment, even amid economic headwinds. To serve the business and its stakeholders well, they look ahead and anticipate several CEO succession scenarios. * Empathy: When a crisis such as Covid hits and the CEO transforms into a chief crisis officer, the boards become unsure how to strike a balance — the creation of a safe space characterised by openness and honesty will not only help the board to maintain a close relationship with the CEO but also allows for timely exchanges, feedback, and alignment on strategic actions. Boards must align their strategic and particularly capital allocation priorities with key drivers of long-term value creation. * Reassess purpose: It is important that boards reassess the organisation’s purpose and value proposition. The world is already looking different — industries and behaviours are being reshaped. By connecting management teams with a wider ecosystem, the board can widen a leader’s understanding of shifting market dynamics. * Building resilience: The pandemic and its aftermath will surely test the stamina of organisations to persevere and be resilient. Boards can play an oversized role in providing the ultimate pressure test of an organisation, as what is decided today will define tomorrow. Paying attention to the possible blurring of lines while talking openly to stakeholders about risks and opportunities — board involvement at this time can be as effective as it can be. Historically, well-constituted boards had the perplexing dilemmas of choosing between where they should intervene and where they should allow the executive team to take the lead. As a result of the pandemic and the sort of changes visible in the external environment, this calibration will need a rethink. The boards and the executive committee will need to collaborate and identify areas where the boards’ strengths can be leveraged, which ones have worked for them in the past, and where they need to empower the executive team to run with their innovative ideas and remain available to absorb any shocks. We believe this will be the most important change that will happen in the functioning of solidly constituted boards in the times to come.

The export of shrimp has also seen a rise with the relaxation of curfew. Aquaculture occupies a major part of farming in Gudivada, Kaikaluru, Mudinepalli and other parts of the district near Kolleru lake. Fish and shrimp ponds are spread over an extent of 30,000 acres and two lakh families depend on aquaculture. The district’s aquaculture industry recorded large losses on account of the sudden fall of exports with Covid-19. Farmers, who export to Kolkata, Delhi and northeastern states, dealt with the blow of a 60% reduction in exports. Many discontinued cultivation of shrimp anticipating further losses. “We have a fish pond on seven acres at Kalidhindi. Our export business collapsed after the lockdown and we are getting poor prices in local markets. We have discontinued farming fish for a while,” M Raghava Raju, a farmer, told TOI. But as the price of chicken touched Rs 280 per kilogram in local markets and mutton soared to Rs 750 per kilogram, there was a sudden demand for fish and prawns. “Consumers who earlier purchased chicken and mutton are now asking for fish. This sudden demand again boosted aquaculture,” said N Chiranjeevi, a meat trader from Mahanti market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/fish-back-in-demand-as-poultry-meat-prices-soar/articleshow/84387149.cms||Venu Lanka

Dinesh Solanki was booked for sexual harassment and under the POCSO Act by the Wadi police. And, now he will have to cool his heels in jail for a long time as cops have also invoked Prevention of Anti-Social Act (PASA) against him. In a first, the city police have begun taking strong action against the persons accused in sexual harassment offences. This year, six men accused in various cases of sexual harassment were booked under PASA. “We have begun invoking PASA against those committing sexual offences in the city. The idea is to send a strong message to such offenders that they will face strict action for their criminal acts. Sexually harassing a woman is a grave offence,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner. “Offenders will think twice before harassing a woman, while victims of sexual harassment too will feel safe to approach the cops and file a complaint,” Singh told TOI. The Gujarat government had in September last year passed a bill to amend the Gujarat Prevention of Anti-Social Act, 1985 and brought sexual offenders, cyber criminals and gambling den operators under its ambit. The police said once PASA is involved against a person, they have to inform the PASA Advisory Board. A person can be kept in detention for up to one year under PASA. Police officials said that IPC section 354 and POCSO Act too deal strictly with such offences but invoking PASA will discourage the offenders. “Those molesting young children or morphing images of women to harass them have depraved mentality. They need to be dealt with sternly. We will keep invoking PASA against the offenders depending on severity of the crime and effect on public order,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/making-city-safer-sexual-offenders-now-face-pasa/articleshow/84386399.cms||Tushar Tere

A few hours before the opening of the Rs 9,375-crore IPO, the allotment to anchor investors was done at Rs 76 per share, at the upper end of the Rs 72-76 IPO price band. Merchant banking sources said that the total demand for the Zomato IPO during the anchor investment process was for about Rs 1.5 lakh crore, indicating an oversubscription of about 35 times the number of shares which were up for pre-IPO allotment. According to a notice on the BSE, notable names among the 186 funds that were allotted shares on Tuesday included global PE majors Tiger Global and Blackrock, along with financial powerhouses like Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, T Rowe Price and the government of Singapore. Among the domestic majors were SBI MF, HDFC MF and ICICI Prudential MF. The much talked about Zomato IPO will open on July 14 and close on July 16. Under Sebi rules, the stock will be listed before the end of the current month, most likely by July 27, market sources said. At the upper end of the price band, Zomato will command a market capitalisation of Rs 60,000 crore. The valuation, which is on a par with the total market value of all the listed hotels companies, has been a subject of much debate since the new age tech-enabled company has been a loss-making one. Zomato’s estimated value is also equal to the combined mcap all the listed quick service restaurants (QSRs) in India, which are its customers as well as competitors. Listed technology company InfoEdge holds a substantial stake in the app-based food delivery major and is selling part of its stake in the IPO worth Rs 375 crore. In the grey market, the premium for the shares of Zomato has seen some marginal decline in recent times. From about Rs 10 per share a week ago, it’s now down to about Rs 7.50, market sources said. The slide indicates waning interest in a stock in the unofficial market in the run-up to its listing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zomato-ipo-subscribed-35x-by-anchor-funds/articleshow/84390303.cms||---

Provisions have capped NPAs at 2.8%. In an interview with TOI, DBS Bank MD & CEO Surojit Shome speaks about the road map for the merged entity... Staff of erstwhile LVB outnumber the original DBS employees. How are you addressing the staff integration? Our first objective was to reach out to the staff despite Covid challenges and make them feel part of a platform where they can grow. We are in the process of merging grades. We have worked with every one of the 4,000 people, other than drivers and sub-staff, to assess their ability to do other jobs. We are now doing the first round of promotions and transfers, which will happen in August. In the last two years, LVB did not do any lending. So, we need more people to grow the business. We think we should be able to redeploy everybody into meaningful jobs. Around 187 persons have taken the option to retire early under a scheme. When will you complete the integration of core banking? LVB had Flexcube as its core banking platform, we have Finacle. By the middle of next year, we will migrate to Finacle 11. It will be a virtual private cloud architecture. When we complete integration, we will rebrand the branches from the present interim branding. That will take up to 12 months. What is the outlook for branches? While we do not need to rationalise the 600 branches in number, we need to make sure they are in the right place. We think about 20% of our branches will go through that optimisation. We will do that in conjunction with network integration. When will you fill in the gaps in your shelf of products...things like demat, credit cards? Demat accounts are already there in the LVB product suite. We will link demat to Digibank customers soon. We are launching a co-branded credit card with Bajaj and we will build a proprietary card on top in the next nine months. Citi is exiting retail. Would you look at this as a growth opportunity? We will look at all opportunities that come along. In this case, there are multiple markets and, as a bank present in multiple markets, we will look at what opportunities are there. You have three platforms now — erstwhile DBS, your digital bank Digibank, and erstwhile LVB. How will you acquire customers? Today, for every account we open in the branch, we open two digitally. We expect the ratio to continue. We are integrating the network so that both banking systems can be accessed in the branch until the migration happens. That gives us the ability to overlay Digibank, which is our route to market for our customers. Now customers can open a Digibank account in 231 branches using biometrics. This will be extended to all branches. Eventually, we will have a single platform at the back end. We aim to make it a paperless process. What about lending? In lending, we have managed to grow gold loans and we will be reviving other product lines. The priority is to grow SME and consumer business, both digitally and phygitally. Will you raise capital? Any plans to go public? We brought in Rs 2,500 crore to plug the gap created by negative capital that LVB had and we have enough for this year’s growth. We will bring in capital in one or two quarters before it is required. In all the six markets that DBS is present, we are 100% subsidiaries. We believe that there is capital at the top and there is no need to raise at multiple levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/will-look-at-all-acquisition-opportunities-dbs-chief/articleshow/84390144.cms||Mayur Shetty

After hearing a PIL, the former chief justice of AP high court had recommended three names to be appointed as presiding officers for land acquisition authorities in Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada and Tirupati. However, the government had only appointed the presiding officer for Visakhapatnam, and kept the other names pending. The petitioners told the court that despite its clear orders, the government has intentionally delayed the appointments. When the court asked the government as to why the appointments have not been made, advocate general S Sriram informed that while the presiding officer for Visakhapatnam was appointed, the other two names were pending as biodata of the officers was not available either with the government or the high court. He said the government consulted the administrative section of the HC to get the biodata and background check of the recommended candidates. As the consultation process was not effective, there has been a delay in appointing the officers, Sriram explained. The high court, while asking the government to file an affidavit, also sought details on who gave the biodata of the Visakhapatnam presiding officer and to explain the process adopted for such appointments. The former chief justice of AP high court had recommended three names as presiding officers for land acquisition authorities in Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada and Tirupati||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/biodata-of-2-judicial-officers-not-available/articleshow/84387644.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The youth, identified as Prithvi from Nulakapeta under Tadepalli mandal of the district, was lying on the tracks in a bid to end his life. By the time the loco pilots of Mumbai-Kakinada Lokmanya Tilak express spotted him, the train was barely 100 metres away. They repeatedly sounded the horn and applied the emergency brakes, but failed to stop the train in time, and both his legs were dismembered before the train could come to a halt. The loco pilots — Hanumatha Rao and Raghuramraju — immediately got down and pulled out a profusely bleeding Prithvi from underneath the bogie. When they saw his dismembered feet, they collected the legs in a polythene bag, lifted him to a bogie and rushed the train to Vijayawada station where RPF personnel and medical staff were on standby. Prithvi was taken to Vijayawada government general hospital where doctors tried to reattach the legs. The procedure failed as he had suffered multiple fractures. He is stated to be out of danger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/youth-survives-but-loses-both-legs-in-suicide-bid/articleshow/84387542.cms||---

Choudhary said the government is seized of the problem being faced by students owing to the delay in their examinations, but no decision would be taken in haste. The government is working on devising ways for conducting examinations in the safest mode amid the pandemic. “We hope that the situation may normalize by the end of August, if it keeps on improving even at the present rate and provided no fresh Covid wave hits the state. Then, in that case, the government may allow the universities to hold their examinations in the month of September with complete Covid-19 protocols, maintaining social distance and hygiene all around the campus and mandatory use of face masks by one and all,” he said. The minister said the youths must get themselves inoculated at the earliest so that their health is not compromised. When asked about the reopening of hostels in colleges and universities, he said the matter is in consideration of the government and a proper decision on this would be taken soon. Most institutions of higher education are facing difficulties in resuming offline classes even with 50% attendance as their hostels are still closed. Until students coming from outside are not provided accommodation in their allotted rooms, they would not be able to attend their classes, the heads of some institutions like NIT and BIT Patna said. Patna University students’ welfare dean Anil Kumar said only those students who have already been vaccinated have been allowed to stay in their respective hostels. Magadh Mahila College principal Shashi Sharma said a few girls are staying in college hostels. However, she pointed out that some students of first-year degree class are less than 18 years of age and as such she can’t demand vaccination certificates from them. The universities and colleges along with senior secondary schools have been allowed to resume their offline classes with 50% attendance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/varsity-exams-not-before-sept-education-minister/articleshow/84384441.cms||B K Mishra

The Ahmedabad Customs as well as the police suspect the involvement of a customs department staffer. The alleged incident took place in May 2021. Soon after the incident, AACC moved an application before the city crime branch on May 14 to undertake further investigation. The alleged incident came to light, when following an intel input, a cargo consignment declared as ‘automobile parts’ was inspected by officials of Ahmedabad Customs. “The cargo consignment weighing roughly 32kg had arrived from Dubai and kept at the warehouse of the AACC for customs clearance. However, Ahmedabad Customs officials had received an intelligence input that the cargo has been mis-declared and is suspected to contain concealed gold. Upon inspecting the consignment, officials found that it weighed less by some 7kg,” said a well-placed source. Ahmedabad Customs department officials examined the CCTV footage and took statements of witnesses. Investigation so far has revealed that the cargo consignment had been tampered with. “An official of Ahmedabad Customs is suspected to be involved in the burglary. We are probing if he tempered with the consignment and removed part of it. The CCTV footage when examined showed the suspect of loading some cargo in his car and leaving," the source further revealed. Gold price stood at Rs 49,500 per 10 gram in the Ahmedabad market on April 23 – just before the markets shut amid Covid19 restrictions here. Going by this, the suspected gold consignment stolen would be worth roughly Rs 3.5 crore. An FIR is likely to be filed soon against the concerned official of Ahmedabad Customs for burglary and criminal trespass under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), confirmed sources at the Ahmedabad Crime Branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/undeclared-gold-worth-rs3-5cr-burgled-from-city-air-cargo-complex/articleshow/84390182.cms||Niyati Parikh

This will be the chief minister’s third visit to the project site after taking over the reins two years ago. The state government is keen to complete the project works by June 2022. Although the chief minister wanted to visit the project site on Wednesday, he put it off due to adverse weather conditions in West Godavari district. The chief minister has made it clear the project should be completed as per the schedule notwithstanding reimbursement issues to be resolved by the Centre. “We have also directed the line departments to complete the resettlement and rehabilitation works for evacuation of the oustees by August,” said water resources minister Dr P Anil Kumar Yadav. While the government has proposed to complete 40,3160 cubic meters of concrete work within 12 months starting from April 2020, the contractor, MEIL, has completed 5,58,073 cubic meters of concrete work. “We surpassed the targets notwithstanding the challenges posed by Covid-19 lockdown, migration of workforce and floods received in the last year,” said Angara Satish, project general manager. MEIL continued the pace with more commitment as it completed 85,300 cubic meters of work in May. It completed 1.2 lakh cubic meters of concrete work by June 2020 against a target of 70,000 cubic meters. “We have completed 83,000 cubic meters of work in February, 2021 against the target of 47,000 cubic meters,” said Satish. The construction of the world’s largest spillway bridge slab was also completed ahead of schedule—42 of the 48 gates have already been set up. These gates are to be fitted with 96 hydraulic cylinders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cms-third-polavaram-visit-likely-next-week/articleshow/84387487.cms||Samdani MN

NEET-UG 2021 was earlier scheduled for April 1, but could not be held due to the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. The registration process for NEET-UG started on Tuesday. “We have too much to do within this limited time period, but I will leave no pages unturned to crack this exam,” said Yummi, a NEET aspirant of Bypass Road area in Patna. “I am also trying to give priority to my health because I don’t want Covid to be a barrier in realising my dreams,” she said. Mukul of Kankarbagh was joyful over the news. “I am expecting the exam centres, too, too maintain all safety measures to make us feel safe. I have got myself fully vaccinated and thoroughly prepared for the entrance examination,” he said. Parents of the medical aspirants in the city were also happy. “I was the first one to break this news to my daughter as my child is not supposed to sail her boat alone. In these unprecedented times, I will try my best to be a source of positivity and motivation for my child. Although it’s not her first attempt, my support and help during her preparations will hopefully make her successful this time,” said Pravesh, the father of a NEET aspirant. Mamta Singh is quite hesitant to send her child out due the current pandemic situation. “Even though I’m sceptical, I consider this to be my child’s decision to appear or opt out. If the decision says yes, then why not. This year, the preparation time was too long. So, may be that’ll make things easy. Although that doesn’t indicate me putting pressure on my ward,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/medical-aspirants-happy-as-neet-date-announced/articleshow/84384594.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Mere consent waiver can’t annul women’s land rights, says Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: In an important order, the Gujarat high court has held that a mere consent affidavit by a sister waiving her rights to ancestral property cannot be treated as a relinquishment deed and her right to a share in the ancestral property is not extinguished. A woman can claim a share and challenge mutation entry in the ancestral property on the exclusion of her name, if her name is excluded without following the procedure under Section 135D of the Gujarat Land Revenue Code. A mere consent affidavit waiving her rights in favour of brothers is not enough to end her property rights. The case before the high court was from Shihor. Haji Deraiya left behind ancestral land. His daughters Roshan Sorathiya and Hasina Kalvatar signed affidavits in 2010 giving up their share. This happened when their father was alive. The father died in October 2010. After that, names of only the three sons were in the revenue records on the basis of consent affidavits by the sisters. The mutation entry was finalised in 2016. After finalisation of transfer of the land to three brothers in 2016, their sister, Roshan Sorathiya, approached the deputy collector questioning the exclusion of her name on basis of an affidavit, which was not a registered document. After finalisation of transfer of the land to three brothers in 2016, their sister, Roshan Sorathiya, approached the deputy collector questioning the exclusion of her name on basis of an affidavit, which was not a registered document. Her application to mutate her name was rejected in 2017. Her revision application before the district collector was rejected in 2018. The special secretary of the revenue department also rejected Roshan Sorathiya appeal in June 2020, mainly on the ground of delay, holding that she questioned the distribution of the property more than six years after it was done on the basis of her relinquishment deed. Sorathiya approached the HC and challenged the revenue department’s decision to not consider her name for a share on the basis of her affidavit. Her lawyer submitted that such consent cannot be treated as a relinquishment deed. It was argued that the woman’s consent was not sought by following the procedure including the issuance of notice under Section 135D of the Code, and the mutation entry was wrongly confirmed in 2016. The brothers opposed the petition saying she challenged the mutation entry at a belated stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-consent-waiver-cant-annul-womens-land-rights/articleshow/84390228.cms||Saeed Khan
---||Vijayawada||Govt files appeal plea challenging Gajapathi Raju’s reinstatement as Mansas trust chair||Vijayawada: The state government has moved the high court challenging the single judge order which reinstated P Ashok Gajapathi Raju as chairman of Mansas trust and Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple at Simhachalam. The government filed three appeal petitions, arguing that the single judge erred in his judgment which was based on the will deed which has become void. It may be recalled that the government had removed Ashok as chairman of Mansas trust and Simhachalam temple trust on March 3, 2020, and appointed Sanchaitha Gajapathi Raju in his place by recognising her as the founder family member. Ashok challenged his removal in the high court, arguing that he was removed arbitrarily without following due procedure. He also stated that his removal was against the trust deed which stipulates that only the eldest male lineal descendants can be appointed as chairman of the trust. The government defended its move, arguing that Sanchaitha was eligible for the position and cannot be discriminated based on gender. The high court, however, set aside the GO and reinstated Ashok as chairman of the two trusts. The government has now appealed against the order, arguing that the single judge made an error in his judgement while ruling in favour of Ashok based on the trust deed which has become void after the 1987 legislation which abolishes all hereditary trusties. The government has also argued that Sanchaitha has preferential right of succession over Ashok according to Hindu Succession Act. While the government has filed three separate petitions, Sanchaitha also filed three separate petitions challenging the single judge order. On Tuesday, only two petitions came up for hearing before the division bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya. After additional advocate general P Sudhakar Reddy, and the counsel for Sanchaitha requested the bench to hear all the matters together, the court posted the matter for hearing after two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-files-appeal-plea-challenging-gajapathi-rajus-reinstatement-as-mansas-trust-chair/articleshow/84387735.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Salem||DRO cancels patta to reclaim occupied temple land||Salem: Following a Madras high court’s direction, the district revenue officer here on Monday cancelled individual patta of two persons for possessing a temple land. Earlier, social activist A Radhakrishnan had approached the court to reclaim the temple land and seeking action against K V Balasubramaniam and K B Vidyashankar for occupying the temple land. The duo constructed a marriage hall and other building on the 12.35 cent land. The market value of land, including the buildings, is estimated to be Rs 20 crore. During the trial, Balasubramaniam and Vidyashankar claimed that the land they possess was poramboke land and not temple land as claimed by the petitioner. They cited government records and argued that the land was initially owned by Balasubramaniam’s father Venkatachalam and they did not occupy any temple land. However, Radhakrishnan cited land documents and argued at the court that Venkatachalam had obtained the patta in 1985 saying that he was residing at the site. Talking to TOI, the activist said officials had modified the land records to support Venkatachalam’s claim by changing the category of land to ‘natham poramboke” from temple land. The petitioner submitted land documents before and after 1985 to support his argument. The documents before 1985 mentioned the land as temple land while the documents after 1985 mentioned it as natham porambokke, he added. The judges, after hearing both sides, directed the Salem district administration on February 22 this year to cancel the patta and to return the land back to the temple, and correct the irregularities in the documents. On Monday, the district revenue officer R Divakar cancelled the individual patta given to Balasubramaniam and Vidyashankar and directed the revenue department officials to make necessary changes in the land records.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/dro-cancels-patta-to-reclaim-occupied-temple-land/articleshow/84391108.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This is the third litter of the tigress T-84 named Arrowhead. The tigress was spotted near the Naali–Ghati forest region in zone-2. An official said, “The tigress is seven years old and the newborns were spotted with the mother for the first time. However, there were indications that the tigress has given birth.” In the past three years, births of 35 tiger cubs have been recorded and Rajasthan now has the ninth highest population of big cats among all states. Though the news has elated wildlife lovers, it has brought more worries for the park managers as RTR is bursting at the seams. The-two-and-a-half-year-old daughters of Arrowhead — Riddhi and Siddhi — are constantly fighting for territory. Due to this, a proposal was floated to shift Riddhi to Sariska from Ranthambore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tigress-arrowheads-third-litter-cheers-wildlife-lovers/articleshow/84393235.cms||---

About 81% of total the 6.9 lakh respondents wanted schools to reopen for offline education, a three-day survey conducted by the Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training. The online survey concluded on Monday and it was observed that the majority of the respondents in Stds IX and X wanted schools to reopen while only about 3% of respondents wanted nursery classes to reopen physically. Pune district had maximum respondents participating in this survey. Government teachers were of the opinion that reopening schools in the rural areas would be easier compared to urban localities. The Department of School Education had issued guidelines for the commencement of classes from Std VIII to XII in the first phase in Covid 19 free rural areas in the academic year 2021-22 from July 15, 2021. Dinkar Temkar, director of MSCERT, had said that parents were asking about starting other classes too, prompting the education department to start a survey for all students, parents and teachers across the state. At the end of the last day, a total of 6.9 lakh respondents participated in the survey and registered their votes of opening or reopening of schools. Since March 2020, the schools have been shut down and were briefly reopened in rural areas in November and December last year. The respondents were categories in five sections from nursery to class XII and the highest votes for reopening schools were given for class IX and X being crucial years. Temkar said, “We also wanted to check the sentiment regarding reopening of schools in rural, urban and semi-urban areas separately so we added that category and received a very good response to it.” Since the first day of the survey the voting has been in a large majority for school reopening and it stayed constant till the end, Temkar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-person-classes-trump-online-schooling-in-survey/articleshow/84391133.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Both Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic bodies have been forced to keep most vaccination centres shut. Moreover, since the vaccination drive started, Pune rural areas have received a large chunk of doses since it includes a large population. Pune ZP chief executive officer (CEO) Ayush Prasad told TOI, “Vaccine supply has been limited. People wait for hours at the vaccination sites just to be told that there are no vaccines available, which has upset many stakeholders. In spite of that, our staff is conducting the vaccination drive across 21 gram panchayats in the 23 villages. We will continue to provide vaccines but former sarpanches, public representatives, and ZP members are demanding more vaccines. So, if we get additional doses from PMC and PCMC, it will help the beneficiaries.” Prasad said that the ZP is providing vaccines to cantonments and District Hospital, Aundh, where beneficiaries are from urban areas. “We will continue with our existing vaccine distribution, but considering the current demand and limited vaccine supply, the civic bodies must provide us some additional doses,” he said. When contacted, a PMC official said that when the civic body is already reeling under a shortage, it will be a difficult task to provide any more doses to the ZP. “We had a discussion with the district immunisation officer on Tuesday, but the decision will be taken by higher authorities, like PMC commissioner and Pune ZP CEO,” said the official. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil said that so far, they have not received any such request from Pune ZP, but an ‘appropriate’ decision will be taken regarding the demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zp-wants-civic-bodies-to-provide-100-doses-for-each-of-23-merged-villages/articleshow/84391195.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Pune||Most districts in Maharashtra to start vaccinating pregnant women from tomorrow||PUNE: Most districts in Maharashtra are likely to start vaccinating pregnant women by Thursday or Friday, state immunisation officer Dr D N Patil told TOI. Though Covid inoculation for the expectant mothers has started in Pune, it has not yet kicked off in some districts because the vaccination staffers are still undergoing necessary training. Dr Patil on Tuesday said, “The training of the vaccination staffers for the drive in this category of beneficiaries has taken place at the national level. After that, there was a state-level training, followed by the district-level training sessions. The staffers have to be trained on aspects such as counselling of pregnant women and Information Education Communication activities. Once the training is complete, all the districts will start vaccination of expectant mothers. Most may even start from Thursday or Friday.” Dr Patil said the districts, which were confident of starting vaccinations for pregnant women after completing the training, could do so. “The training also involves updating the vaccination staffers about the need to take constant follow-ups with pregnant women after vaccination,” he said. On separate centres for pregnant women, Dr Patil said it has been left to the discretion of the vaccination and health authorities of the respective districts to choose the option. “The districts have been given the liberty to have separate centres, or sessions, for the pregnant women if they have the resources or administer jabs to this beneficiary group at the same facilities as others with due protocols. However, the number of women coming to such centres or sessions (meant only for pregnant women) should be adequate to avoid any vaccine wastage,” he said. Pune zilla parishad chief executive officer Ayush Prasad told TOI, “We had started vaccination of pregnant women on July 9 via a special drive during the monthly health check-up for the expectant mothers. A gynaecologist on call is attached to each primary health care centre in Pune rural. During the drive, the women coming to the primary health centres underwent check-ups and were also counselled, before getting the jabs.” Prasad, however, said the demand for vaccination among pregnant women was still low. They could visit their nearest PHCs to get the shots, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/most-districts-to-start-vaccinating-pregnant-women-from-tomorrow/articleshow/84391166.cms||Neha Madaan

Around noon time, the extension of the imposing building called Camara Municipal de Goa, housing the municipal administration and standing in the Horta Ribeiro garden, came tumbling down, causing panic in the city. Three persons who were inside the more recently constructed annexure got trapped in the debris and died. A fourth was critically injured. Three people died when part of the municipal building collapsed“I was returning from school in Fontainhas and saw the dust in the air and the commotion below the Panaji church,” said Milind Angle, a septuagenarian. His residence was located in a building along Atmaram Borkar road and the building lay along the route to school. The main building, which had been constructed many years prior to the tragedy, stood firm. The Portuguese governor rushed to the spot and supervised the rescue operations and work to clear the debris. “I was witness to this rescue operation and I could see the workers hard at their task,” Angle said. The social media was awash with the tragedy that occurred nearly seven decades back. “One of my kin, who was in the building, died in the crash. My father narrowly escaped, as he returned home after delivering the lunch to him,” a member of the group posted.

---||Goa||Goa: Same old story as incessant rain leaves Panaji submerged||PANAJI: Normal life was thrown out of gear on Tuesday as the heavy showers that have lashed the state since Monday evening left several areas waterlogged and roads punctured with potholes. In Panaji, the arterial 18th June road was submerged, and in low-lying Mala, water entered some houses. It was a nightmare for motorists, especially those on two-wheelers, as the incessant showers and waterlogged roads made navigating the state extremely dangerous. Substandard work and poor road engineering also lay exposed, as the washed-away asphalt left gaping holes, leaving riders with no option but to zigzag their way home. Most areas of Panaji were waterlogged with the arterial 18th June road submerged, and water entering some shops and houses in the state capitalThe state, which has been under orange alert since Monday, saw its reservoirs fill up to capacity on Tuesday. The Selaulim dam in Sanguem, which supplies water to most of South Goa district, began overflowing early Tuesday morning. Barring the Anjunem reservoir in Sattari, the other reservoirs were full to the brim. Elsewhere in the state, the scene was no better. A woman was injured in Adpai, Ponda after a wall of the next-door house collapsed. Kishori Naik was trapped in the debris and was rescued by neighbours after she raised an alarm. She was rushed to the sub-district hospital in Ponda, and then taken to GMC, Bambolim, as she suffered multiple injuries. In Loliem, Canacona, a landslide occurred, disrupting vehicular traffic. Cumulative rainfall data shows that Mapusa received 84mm of rainfall from 8.30am to 6pm on Tuesday, while Panaji (72mm), Canacona (41.5mm), Pernem (59.5mm), Old Goa (77mm) and Mormugao (45.6mm) also recorded high numbers. Some parts received more than 100 mm rainfall in the 24 hours ending Tuesday night. “Some shops along the 18th June road experienced waterlogging due to which part of the road had to be closed for vehicular traffic for around 45 minutes. Traffic police reopened the road after the water receded,” said Rohan Zaveri, a businessman from Panaji. Residents of Mala also experienced a flood-like situation for nearly two hours. “The situation, however, was not as bad as it was during Cyclone Tauktae. The water receded on its own,” said resident Carlos George. Fire and emergency services received around 30 calls of trees fallen on roads. A jackfruit tree came down on a house in Dhavli, partially damaging it. No one was injured. Citizens complained of power interruptions during the heavy rain. In South Goa, the electricity department had to enforce restrictions on power consumption for a few hotels in Cavelossim, after a pole collapsed and the line tripped on Tuesday morning at Velim. The pole got uprooted and the 33 kv double feeder supplying power from Cuncolim to Velim and Carmona was interrupted. The department made arrangements for alternative power supply from Benaulim to Carmona and Velim. Superintending engineer, South, Rajeev Samant, said that citizens were not affected after arrangements were made for alternate power supply. Full power was restored to the area in the evening. The India meteorological department (IMD), in its earlier forecast, had said that the formation of a low-pressure area over coastal Andhra Pradesh would enhance rainfall activity over Goa. As on July 13, the low-pressure area has become less marked. However, due to the presence of other systems, the increased rainfall activity is very likely to continue over Goa up to around July 17, the IMD warned. The likelihood of very heavy rainfall of 115.6-204.4mm in 24 hours continues over Goa till July 17, with scattered and isolated spatial distributions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/same-old-story-as-incessant-rain-leaves-panaji-submerged/articleshow/84391198.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Lucknow||When Yashpal Sharma smashed 4 centuries in Sheesh Mahal trophy||LUCKNOW: Way back in May 1977, a feisty young batsman smashed four back-to-back centuries during Lucknow’s famous summer cricket tournament of yesteryears, the Sheesh Mahal Trophy, a feat that helped him get a berth in the Indian cricket team. The explosive batsman, Yashpal Sharma, went on to become a part of the historic 1983 World Cup squad and emerged as the second highest run-getter for India. Sharma, 66, passed away following a cardiac arrest on Tuesday. “He played a memorable innings in Lucknow by hitting four centuries in Sheesh Mahal tournament (1977) matches at Colvin Taluqdars Ground and KD Singh Babu Stadium,” said Pradeep Shukla, former Ranji player and vice-president of Cricket Association Lucknow (CAL). “Yashpal had an old connection with Lucknow. We used to play for FCI (Food Corporation of India). He later joined the State Bank of India team. We also played in the Sir Frank Worrell Trophy in Lucknow in 1975-76,” he recalled. Sharma also led the SBI team in Sheesh Mahal tournament in 1985. Meanwhile, tributes poured in for the legendary player. Senior IAS officer and president of Cricket Association Lucknow Navneet Sehgal and secretary Khaliq M Khan expressed grief at Sharma's demise. Former Uttar Pradesh Ranji player Ubaid Kamal said, “Yashpal ji was my coach when I became a part of the UP team in 1998. I have played a lot under his guidance. His death has come as an irreparable loss to the Indian cricket.” Former Ranji player Ambrish Gautam, said his bright smile and cheerfulness was infectious. A sad day for cricket world: KirmaniFormer wicket keeper Syed Kirmani, Yashpal Sharma’s team mate in 1983 World Cup, said it was a sad day for the cricketing fraternity. “He was the backbone of the team and very dedicated to the core. Yashpal was a brilliant athlete and fastest runner of our 1983 team,” he said. “I still remember the run out of Lamb in the 1983 semi-final,” Kirmani recalled. “He was a man of all good habits. He was a non-smoker and a vegetarian. My heart goes out to his family,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/when-yashpal-sharma-smashed-4-centuries-in-sheesh-mahal-trophy/articleshow/84393330.cms||Fazal Khan

---||Nagpur||No firefighting relaxations to saw mills: Maharashtra fire directorate||NAGPUR: In a jolt to saw mill owners in Vidarbha and city in particular, state fire director SS Warik has refused to give relaxations to them regarding firefighting water tanks on their premises. The directorate of Maharashtra Fire Service has also directed them to follow rules of the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2006. The NMC’s fire and emergency services department had declared around 400 saw mills in the district unsafe (including 169 in the city) after it found lack of firefighting measures on their premises. It has also directed the MSEDCL and NMC’s water works department and Orange City Water Limited to disconnect power and water supply to these unsafe structures. However, the Nagpur Timber Merchants Association had challenged the NMC’s decision by filing an appeal with the state fire director and sought relaxations regarding certain measures suggested by the city fire department. Among various measures, the saw millers sought relaxation in installing water tanker capacity from minimum 25,000 litre to 10,000 litre for wood industries (saw mills) operating in Vidarbha and Nagpur in particular. Warik pointed out that saw mills are classified as ‘high hazard industries’ in accordance with the National Building Code of India (NBC) and Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2006. As per acts for saw mills, the provisions are comparatively stringent than prescribed by us, he stated in his order. Citing an example, Warik stated that as per NBC, for saw mills with a built-up area between 300sqm and 500sqm, it suggests an underground water tank having a capacity of 1 lakh litre, while for terrace it recommends a 20,000 litre tank. However, the state is asking them (saw mills’ owners) to install a 50,000 litre underground tank and 10,000 litre overhead tank. The relaxation was granted in the past itself. Looking at the fires that have occurred in the past in the city, the new demand is unacceptable, said Warik. The fire directorate, however, may reconsider the request and sought certain information like no-objection certificates and fire compliance certificates from the fire department, locality of saw mills, are these saw mills in clusters or individual separate units, maximum and minimum quantity material (wood) stored in each cluster and industrial unit. Saw mills owners, however, claimed that the Fire Safety Act, 2006, should not be applicable to them as wooden industries were set up prior to the Act. “In fact, we were operating the saw mills since last many decades and a special fire station (Lakadganj) had been set up for the units itself,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-firefighting-relaxations-to-saw-mills-state-fire-dir/articleshow/84391276.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni heard a PIL on Covid-19 management and said there are substantial compliances of the court’s directions. They cautioned that people should still take precautions with the third wave having set in some states, according to news reports. “We have to take all preventive measures. We don’t want any lowering of guard,” Chief Justice Datta said. It was then that Justice Kulkarni referred to the Wimbledon men’s final. “It was a sight of the year. Not one person was wearing a mask. We were talking when that situation will come here,” said Justice Kulkarni. He said had an Indian cricketer, who was present, worn a mask he would have been the “odd man out”. Justice Kulkarni said he spotted only one woman with a mask. “Almost entire four hours, I was trying to see who was sitting with a mask. People were that confident. We can also achieve it. Vaccinating everyone is the key to it,” he said. Earlier, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said there was no need for a separate cell to look into alleged criminal negligence of doctors in cognizable offences before an FIR is filed. A May 2010 GR directed establishing such committees in all districts. The judges said if dormant, the committees must be made active.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-vaccine-jabs-will-rid-us-of-masks-like-wimbledon/articleshow/84391303.cms||Rosy Sequeira

After the meeting, Vishweshwar made it clear that Revanth did not invite him to come back into Congress. “We discussed about the strategy to bring together ‘anti-TRS forces’ to fight on issues like Krishna water sharing, failure of the government to address the unemployed problem and 1.91 lakh vacancies not being filled up,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revanth-meets-konda-sets-off-ex-mps-rejoining-talk/articleshow/84393378.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Pune||Transport department identifies 7km accident-prone eway stretch of the Pune-Mumbai expressway||PUNE: A seven-kilometre stretch of the Pune-Mumbai expressway, just after the Pune-Lonavla ghat section, has been deemed an accident-prone stretch by the state transport department. Senior officials who conducted a six-day crackdown on the high-speed corridor last week said drivers needed to be extra vigilant and pay more attention on this stretch, which begins at the spot where the erstwhile Amrutanjan bridge once stood. “We have studied the pattern of the accidents on this stretch over a one-year period and have concluded that this was a dangerous stretch. In the past six months, six accidents have occurred on this stretch and four people lost their lives,” deputy transport commissioner (enforcement) Abhay Deshpande told TOI. Deshpande blamed carelessness on the part of drivers, who he said would get complacent after navigating the tricky ghat roads. “Motorists tend to be more alert when they are driving in the ghat section, which has twists and turns; they tend to be more in control of the vehicle. Once they leave the ghat section, motorists seem to think they can let their guard down, which leads to mistakes on this stretch which slopes and curves,” Deshpande said. State transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne told TOI that they were planning to curb such behaviour among motorists through regular and surprise checks in coordination with the state highway police. “We have observed that the presence of even one person in a uniform makes a difference and intend to do station more personnel, apart from holding surprise checks. The idea is to not just fine motorists, but also sensitize them to safe driving,” Deshpande said. Deshpande said the food court complex near Lonavla was not an area of concern. “We identify accident-prone zones based on statistics and so, the the area near the food court where several vehicles enter/ exit is not an area of concern,” he said. Deshpande further stated that accident-prone zone change frequently. “It is not necessary that a particular area will always be accident-prone. This particular stretch of the expressway has become a frequently accident-prone zone,” he added. Harshad Abhyankar, director of Save Pune Traffic Movement, said ignorance was to blame. “Many drivers are not aware of blind spots and don’t know to look for them before changing lanes on the expressway. In other countries, motorists are taught to identify blind spots in driving schools. The transport department needs to adopt this. As for speeding, police should fine offenders heavily. Speed guns and constant monitoring are also key,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/transport-department-identifies-7km-accident-prone-eway-stretch/articleshow/84391252.cms||Joy Sengupta

The case was registered with the Loni Kalbhor police station on Tuesday after a video showing the woman enjoying the ride, while crossing Dive Ghat became viral on the social media. “The woman and her family members left Bhosari and were on the way to attend a relative’s wedding at Saswad in rural Pune. She sat on the bonnet of the car, while her father was driving the vehicle at high speed, risking the woman’s life and that of others seated inside while crossing the ghat section at about 10.30am,” said senior police inspector Rajendra Mokashi. Mokashi added, “The woman’s relative riding on a motorcycle was following the car, when he shot a video of her seated on the car. After the video became viral, we identified the registration number of the car and traced it to a marriage hall in Saswad.” “We have registered an FIR relating to disobedience under the Indian Penal Code, National Disaster Management Act, Covid19 Rules and Motor Vehicles Act against the woman, her father and others,” Mokashi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-book-woman-for-travel-fun-on-car-bonnet/articleshow/84391271.cms||---

The city-based Anjani Logistics Private Limited has been allotted the tender to build and operate the hospital on 0.3 acres. This would be the second medical facility inside Mihan campus after AIIMS. “We’ve allotted the bid to the highest bidder after a transparent and speedy process. We received a good response for this tender with six players vying for it. The Ramdaspeth-based firm had quoted Rs1.11 crore as the base price for setting up the multi-storied hospital,” MADC managing director Deepak Kapoor told TOI. The company has to submit its plans to MADC in a couple of months on the proposed hospital building and other facilities to be made available to patients. The bidder was selected after MADC conducted its technical and financial scrutiny based on documents. Confirming the development, Anjani Logistics MD Narendra Jichkar said he would soon be submitting the project report to MADC, after finalizing it in consultation with the architect. “It would be a state-of-the-art hospital with all the facilities. We aim to complete the construction within two-and-a-half years. I bid for it as my wife is a practicing doctor and son is pursuing MBBS. Our company is being run by me and my younger brother. We see good scope for the hospital inside Mihan in future,” he told TOI. The firm has also bid for a residential and commercial complex spread over four acres inside Mihan, but its tenders are yet to be allotted. “Unless we finalise the hospital design, we can’t predict the cost of the project, but it would be like other top multispecialty hospitals in the city,” Jichkar said. According to Kapoor, this would be the third major investment in Mihan project amid Covid-19 pandemic after Persistent Systems and Kalpana Aviation. Setting up of a hospital and hotel were his initiatives, after witnessing the chaotic situation during pandemic times. The tenders for a five-star hotel would also be finalised shortly. “After the end of the pandemic, these two industries would witness a big surge across the globe. The proposed hospital has huge potential to provide direct and indirect jobs to hundreds of youths. It would require doctors, nurses, ward boys and other paramedical staff. Many other ancillary units in the form of supply chain would also thrive due to it. Mihan is my top priority and is all set to boom with more investments like this,” Kapoor, also Mihan India Limited chairman, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-firm-wins-bid-to-build-multispecialty-hospital-in-mihan/articleshow/84391254.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Pune||Maharashtra: No halts for palkhis along route to Pandharpur||PUNE: The annual palkhi procession of Sant Dnyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram will not make any stopovers or halt anywhere along the way to Pandharpur in view of Covid restrictions in Pune and neighbouring Solapur district. The Pune district administration has issued the guidelines. “The buses carrying the palkhi and the warkaris will travel under police protection. As many people and devotees are expected to turn up along the route, we had to take this step to prevent it,” district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said. For the second consecutive year, the state government has not allowed the annual pilgrimage on foot that witnesses lakhs of warkaris taking a 250km pilgrimage carrying the padukas (footwear) of Sant Tukaram and Sant Dnyaneshwar from Dehu and Alandi, respectively, to reach the temple town of Pandharpur on ‘Aashadhi Ekadashi’. The government has allowed only 40 warkaris who will travel in a bus with each palkhi procession. The padukas will reach Pandharpur on the Ashadhi Ekadashi which falls on July 20. Also, any assembly of five or more people is not permitted in the villages along the route on July 19. Sanjay More, trustee of the Sant Tukaram Maharaj temple trust, said, “We will conduct RT-PCR tests of all 40 participants two days in advance. They will be kept in isolation in Dehu village.” The Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj Temple trust will also adopt the same strategy. Pilgrims called warkaris walk along with the chariots carrying the padukas and usually halt for rest along the way. In Pune, both the palkhis and the warkaris wait for a day in different temples before starting the next day. The palkhis and their respective followers split after crossing Hadapsar and carry on on different routes before meeting outside Pandharpur again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-halts-for-palkhis-along-route-to-pandharpur/articleshow/84391314.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Retired government employee loses over Rs 5 lakh to card swap trick||PUNE: A 61-year-old retired central government employee trusted a stranger at an ATM and ended up losing his debit card and, subsequently, Rs 5 lakh from his account. As per a complaint lodged by Market Yard area resident Kashinath Dhavare, a fraudster swapped his debit card with another card at an ATM in Camp on January 5. By February 1, the trickster had withdrawn Rs 5.08 lakh. Dhavare told police he visited the ATM on East Street and inserted the card and keyed in the PIN. There was another person in the kiosk, who made a note of the PIN. As per the complaint, as Dhavare was waiting for ATM to dispense the cash — the ATM screen displayed a “transaction pending” message — the stranger stepped up and told Dhavare he had not inserted the card properly. The complaint stated that the man removed Dhavare’s card, diverted his attention and replaced it with an inoperative card and left the spot. Police said the fraudster used the card at different ATMs to withdraw the cash. Based on Dhavare’s description of the suspect and CCTV footage, the police are trying to ascertain his identity. “We hope to crack the case soon,” senior inspector Deepak Lagad of the Wanowrie police said. “Dhavare had not read the text alerts of transactions sent by the bank. When he visited the bank, he discovered his account had zero balance. He then approached the police then,” Lagad said. “I have two nieces who use my smartphone to attend online classes. My phone is busy for most of the day. I did receive text messages from the bank about transactions done by the fraudster,” Dhavare told TOI. “I have requested the Wanowrie police to give priority to my complaint. I hope they can arrest the suspect help me get my money back soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/retd-govt-employee-loses-over-rs-5-lakh-to-card-swap-trick/articleshow/84391285.cms||Asseem Shaikh

The system of liquor retail outlets near main roads with heavy vehicular traffic and presence of public should be avoided, a division bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly said. A case registered suo motu by the court on the basis of a letter written by Justice Devan Ramachandran highlighting the long queues in front of liquor retail outlets in violation of Covid-19 norms was considered by the court. Last week, the court had expressed its anxiety about the presence of crowds without social-distancing norms in front of liquor outlets. Stating that the court is concerned and that it cannot ignore such incidents where crowding in violation of Covid safety norms occur, the court had asked the government to respond. During Tuesday’s hearing, state government submitted that it has taken action to lessen the crowding in front of liquor outlets. Government informed the court that the crowds in front of liquor outlets will lessen as bars have been permitted to reopen. A digital payment system has also been introduced for the sale of liquor, the court was told.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/consider-moving-liquor-outlets-from-main-roads-hc/articleshow/84388995.cms||---

The ‘fast against dowry’ is being organised by Gandhian organisations here on Wednesday. The governor, who will fast at the Raj Bhavan from 8am to 6pm, will take part in the prayer meeting being planned at the Gandhi Bhavan at Thycaud. The prayer meeting that will begin at 4.30pm is aimed at creating awareness against giving and accepting dowry. “Our beloved state of Kerala was recently in the news for a tragic death due to dowry. It is sad that the spectre of dowry continues to raise its ugly head in our state which has been globally acclaimed for enviable social indicators like literacy and life expectancy. Mahatma Gandhi has said any young man who makes dowry a condition to marriage discredits his education and his country and dishonours women-hood,” the governor said in his message against dowry on Tuesday. He further said that the ‘Sthreepaksha Keralam’ initiative of the government of Kerala also emphasises the need to ensure the dignity of our women by saying no to dowry and related practises. Giving and taking dowry are criminal offences which attract imprisonment up to five years. More than that, it is a grave injustice and ignominy to the dignity of women whose contributions to Kerala’s growth are widely acknowledged. Respect for women is an ideal that elevates the society to noble levels of social welfare, as advised by our scriptures, he said, quoting verses from Upanishad. He urged the younger population to come forward to boldly say no to a marriage that involves dowry. It would go a long way in creating greater awareness and ensuring gender equality and social justice, he said. The governor had visited the residence of Vismaya in Kollam and had consoled her grieving family members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/governor-to-join-protest-fast-against-dowry-menace-today/articleshow/84389066.cms||---

With the help of passersby, we brought Nitin out from under the car and took him and Seeta to a nearby hospital.” From there, the two were referred to Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, where the boy succumbed to his injuries early on Monday. The condition of Seeta is stated to be stable. Kundal Lal said Congress councillor Baljinder Singh Rimpa was driving the car and his minor son was with him. “Rimpa was drunk at the wheel. That is why he was speeding the car and lost control over it,” he added. City Raikot police station ASI Balwinder Singh said a case has been registered under sections 279 (rash driving), 304-A (causing death by negligence), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC against councillor Rimpa, a resident of Guru Nanak Pura of Raikot. He has been arrested. “His medical examination was conducted to ascertain if he was drunk or not. Its report is awaited,” the ASI added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/congress-councillor-arrested-after-his-car-kills-13-year-old/articleshow/84386648.cms||---

The deceased, Swikar Luthra, had been arrested for running a counterfeit coin racket in 2016. He had come to meet his lawyer around 9pm along with a friend and two others known to them. Some of them had criminal antecedents. The five of them were allegedly consuming liquor when Luthra was shot dead. A bullet hit him in his spine and he collapsed. CCTV footage showed the four others dragging Luthra away and trying to clean the blood. Police said Luthra’s friend, Pradeep, was absconding, while the rest were being questioned. According to police, Luthra was out on bail and had gone with Pradeep to meet advocate Arun Sharma in his chamber. Later, he called Darshan, an auto driver, who was involved in theft cases. Sharma’s driver, Rohit, was also sitting in the chamber. DCP (Dwarka) Santosh Meena said, “Luthra was taken to Roop Rani Maggo Hospital from Dwarka courts complex advocates’ chambers with a bullet injury in his back. While Pradeep is missing, the others are being questioned. We have recovered CCTV footage of the incident and are examining it.” Sharma told police that Luthra had fired in the air and the bullet hit him, but this did not match with the versions given by the others. “Each of them is telling a different story. Something is amiss. Since they went in their cars towards the chamber, the pistol could not be detected by the security staff,” said an investigating officer. Sources claimed that the station house officer had earlier written to the court authorities around a month ago about advocates drinking in their chambers. Advocate YP Singh, president of Dwarka Courts Bar Association, said, “The matter is being investigated. We will cooperate in the investigation and ensure that such incidents do not happen again. We will take strict steps against the culprits.” “The allegation that lawyers drink liquor in their chambers late at night is false. This is a one-off incident and the entire community is not involved. This incident occurred in the corridor of the lawyers’ chambers block. It was a tiff between two parties involved in a case,” added Singh. The bar association president further stated that a meeting was held at 10.30pm with the district judge wherein it was discussed to tighten the security of the court premises and fix timings for use of the chambers. “We have proposed to open the chambers from 9am to 6pm from now on. Further, it was discussed to take measures to ensure that people who may pose a threat to the law and order situation are not called into the chambers late in the evening,” Singh said. Police claimed the PCR did not receive a call about the incident and they were informed by the hospital around 10.45pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/44-yr-old-shot-inside-lawyers-chamber/articleshow/84391375.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Congress not to project bypoll candidate||HYDERABAD: After Kaushik Reddy’s episode, Congress has decided not to project anyone as its likely candidate to contest Huzurabad bypoll. A strategy to keep the names of top three contenders under wraps will be implemented to avoid poaching of its candidates by the ruling TRS. On his part, former MP from Karimnagar Ponnam Prabhakar has said he is not keen on entering the electoral fray from Huzurabad. Kaushik, who was touted as the main candidate from Congress for the Huzurabad bypoll, resigned from the party on Monday. He is likely to join the TRS soon. He had thrown a challenge to TPCC chief A Revanth Reddy and Prabhakar to contest the Huzurabad by-election and try not to lose the deposit. The think-tank of the Telangana Congress has given the task of short-listing the top three contenders for the bypoll to the party’s newly-constituted election strategy and management committee headed by former deputy chief minister Damodar Raja Narasimha. The committee is preparing the list of contenders in consultation with MLC T Jeevan Reddy, MLA D Sridhar Babu and former party working president Prabhakar. A team led by Raja Narasimha will tour Huzurabad to know the ground situation. He is from SC community. Huzurabad constituency has over 45 per cent of voters from SC community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-not-to-project-bypoll-candidate/articleshow/84393413.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Nagpur||Awaiting DGCA nod for starting NFC admissions: Divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Flying Club (NFC) is waiting for a certification and other approvals from the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) before admitting students to its Private Pilot License (PPL) and Commercial Private License (CPL) courses. This was informed by divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare-Verma during her visit to TOI-MT office on Tuesday. Prodded by Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, the British era club had restarted flying activities from March 25 by successfully flying its three out of four aircraft. The NFC was closed for the last three-and-half years due to Maharashtra government’s apathy. Earlier, it was reopened in 2008, again on the HC directives, after being defunct for over 14 years. Speaking to TOI, the newly appointed divisional commissioner, who’s ex-officio chairman of the government-run NFC, said vacancies of a ground instructor and other staff required to restart the flying activities have been filled. “We’re awaiting the DGCA’s nod. Due to Covid pandemic, the operations were affected for some time, which led to a slight delay. Now, we’ve written to the concerned authorities to grant the certification and necessary approvals at the earliest,” she said. Speaking on the projected Covid third wave, Lavangare, who has been appointed as the first woman divisional commissioner of Nagpur division comprising six districts, said the administration is fully geared up to tackle the deadly virus this time. “Measures are being taken to ready adequate beds for children if they contract the virus and ensure oxygen supply is sufficient. However, more emphasis will be placed on preventing the spread of the virus. The administration has instructed all concerned to diagnose patients at the early stage apart from following contact tracing strictly. During the first two waves, people suffered more as we didn’t have the experience of handling the virus. But, now we’re taking all measures to fight it out and even funds have been made available,” said the divisional commissioner. While acknowledging that Covid pandemic has put hospitals under tremendous stress, Lavangare said in some cases overuse of facilities also led to fire incidents. “We’ve completed survey of these hospitals and a report has been submitted. We will be initiating measures on a short- and long-term basis, which would require huge funds. However, as a matter of urgency, we’ve instructed all hospitals to clear their emergency exits of any obstructions,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/awaiting-dgca-nod-for-starting-nfc-admissions-div-commr/articleshow/84391356.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

BPCL told the state government that the first-generation (1G) food grain-based ethanol plant will require 100 acres of land located in close proximity to a water source as the facility would require about 4,000 kilo-litres of water per day for regular operations, BPCL executive director (bio fuels) Anurag Saraogi said on Tuesday. Saraogi, who was leading a high-powered team of BPCL officials, said this during discussions with Telangana industries principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan, said a release issued by the state government on Tuesday. Saraogi said that in view of the 20% blending targets by 2025-26 set by the roadmap document released by NITI Aayog and the Union ministry of petroleum & natural gas (MoPNG) in June-2021, BPCL is planning to set up the 500 KLD capacity grain-based 1G Ethanol plant in Telangana. Ranjan assured BPCL that the state government would extend all necessary support to set up theplant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bpcl-plans-ethanol-plant-in-telangana/articleshow/84391325.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Less than 16% of population in Nagpur has some protection||NAGPUR: Even after starting Covid vaccination programme 178 days ago, less than 9% of the total population in the district has been fully inoculated. If the number of people, who had contracted the virus and gained some immunity after recovering from it, is taken into account, then less than 16% people in the district have got some protection against Covid-19. Experts are wary over the lesser number of people having immunity, which they feel will not be able to prevent or keep the projected third wave low if the virus happens to be more infectious and virulent compared to the one which led to the second wave. As per the data of state’s public health department, 14,63,187 (27.75%) out of estimated population of 52,72,665 have taken the first dose in the district between January 16 and July 12. Also, 4,62,804 (8.77%) have got the second dose. As per the data of civil surgeon, 3.53 lakh people had contracted the virus in the last six months and they also have some immunity because of the antibodies generated in their body. Thus, around 8.16 lakh people are likely to have immunity either from the infection or vaccination, which comes to 15.45% of the total population. As on date, 274 vaccination centres are being operated in the district — 146 by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) in city, 11 by private hospitals and 117 by zilla parishad in rural areas. Around 80,000 people can be inoculated daily at these centres, each having capacity of vaccinating around 300 per day. Around 39,23,391 people from the district are eligible for vaccination as they are above 18 years of age, reveals the PHD data. Had the district seen vaccination of 50,000 people per day, all eligible persons would have received the first dose within 80 days from the start of the inoculation drive on January 16. However, due to limited production followed by shortage of doses, the government had rolled out the vaccine in phased manner beginning with healthcare workers (HCWs) followed by frontline workers (FLWs), 60-plus along with 45-plus comorbids, all above 45 years and lastly 18-plus. Since the roll out of vaccination for 45-plus on April 1, there has been irregular and insufficient supply of vaccine, which has hampered the programme badly. Private hospitals have facilitated all three vaccines Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V in the city from May 31 onwards, but not many have preferred the paid jabs. Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association Dr Anup Marar said, “Only 27% of total population had first dose till date of which only 31% have taken the second dose. If we consider 4.6 lakh people as fully vaccinated vis-à-vis 52.73 lakh population in the district, it statistically projects a very grave picture.” “These extremely poor numbers show only around 8% of the total population as fully vaccinated. We should have vaccinated at least 70% of the total population by now to limit mortality rate and control Covid admissions during the forthcoming third wave,” he said. “The inconsistent availability of Covid vaccine and non-optimal involvement of private healthcare sector in the drive is serious. People are now responsive and eager to get vaccinated. Authorities should hasten all efforts to ensure ample vaccine availability, not only in all government health centres but also in all hospitals which functioned as Covid hospitals across the city so as to improve the vaccination rate,” he said. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, “We need a very high vaccination coverage to prevent the third wave. Anything above 60% would have been satisfactory. But actual vaccination coverage till date is very less. Of the total vaccinated people, many were earlier infected with the disease. Thus, the district now comprises non-immune population in large number. Authorities should find out all unvaccinated geographical pockets across the district and cover all.” Pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnakar, who is national secretary of Indian Chest Society, said, “First we concentrated on testing, testing and testing. Vaccination is the only solution for this pandemic. Therefore, focus should have been vaccine, vaccine and vaccine. Unfortunately, only 5-6% of total population in the country is fully vaccinated. It is not enough to get protection from the projected third wave.” “The number of immune people is very meagre and doesn’t matter much in the pandemic. At least, 60% of total population should have antibodies against Covid-19. The situation in rural areas is very bad compared to urban pockets. It would not be wrong to say disaster on our doorstep if the virus during the third wave proves to be more infectious,” he said. As vaccine trials on children below 18 years are underway at present, so there are least chances of the actual vaccine roll out for them before the projected third wave. Average vaccination performance of the district is around 54,000 per day, if the data of the last three sessions is considered. At this rate, the administration will need 45 more days to complete the first dose of the remaining 24.6 lakh eligible people. Majority of the centres are administering Covishield, second dose of which can be taken only after 84 days. Thus, five more months will be required if we have to complete the second dose of all beneficiaries, but this will be subject to daily availability of around 60,000 doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/less-than-16-of-popn-in-dist-has-some-protection/articleshow/84391439.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: NDS threatens to withdraw as CAFO ‘insults’ commandant||NAGPUR: The Nuisance Detection Squad (NDS) of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Tuesday threatened to withdraw from the services after chief accounts and finance officer Vijay Kolhe allegedly misbehaved with its commandant Virsen Tambe. The NDS had approached the NMC’s finance and accounts department to enquire about the status of June honorarium of 176 civic cops deployed in all 10 zones. Usually, the department disburses the monthly honorarium of the NDS team before 10th of every month, which is being delayed for the last couple of months. “The NDS personnel got their honorarium for May on June 26,” said sources. This month too, the honorarium was not disbursed even after July 10. So, on Monday, NDS commandant Tambe had sent a staff from his department to the accounts department to enquire about it. Dahibale, an official from the accounts department, informed the staff that the honorarium file clearance was pending with accounts officer Rajesh Meshram for his and CAFO’s signatures. The staff then approached Meshram, who clarified that no file related to NDS honorarium was pending with him. In fact, Meshram said he did not receive any such file. Dahibale then claimed to have misplaced the NDS honorarium file. However, the file was later traced with Dahibale himself after Tambe threatened to approach municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B. Instead of disbursing the pending honorarium, Kolhe on Tuesday summoned the NDS commandant and allegedly misbehaved with him. “Though I was talking to him humbly, Kolhe behaved arrogantly,” claimed Tambe. Agitated over the episode, all NDS zonal heads and civic cops have rallied behind their commandant and offered to withdraw their services with immediate effect. Later, Tambe met additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi, deputy commissioner Nirbhay Jain and apprised them of the issue. He also reported the incident to mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, who assured to look into the matter. The mayor said he has already directed the CAFO to release the NDS dues at the earliest. “Delay without any reason will not be tolerated,” said Tiwari. The mayor also said the CAFO has denied to have misbehaved with the NDS commandant. The NMC has roped in NDS team to curb civic nuisances like throwing garbage in public places, urinating in open, stocking construction material on footpaths and roads etc. Besides, the civic body has also used the NDS for implementing Covid-19 protocols, providing security at RT-PCR testing and vaccination centres. Moreover, the NDS personnel have also helped the NMC’s enforcement department during anti-encroachment drives across the city, apart from recovering Rs13 crore revenue from defaulters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nds-threatens-to-withdraw-as-cafo-insults-commandant/articleshow/84391330.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

They further said that GHMC officials were well aware of the issue being faced by the public but failed to address it before the monsoon. “You can see the pathetic condition of the road, which has turned into a death trap. In case of negligence, a major accident may happen,’’ one of the shopkeepers, Moin, told TOI. Motorists complained that GHMC reportedly failed to lay a new road, which is used by train passengers and others, being located very close to Hafeezpet MMTS railway station. “Everyone passing through this route will have to be cautious or else accidents will occur. The edge of the road is full of potholes, posing a serious threat to the motorists.

The road from Nanoshi junction leading towards Guirim panchayat, which witnesses heavy traffic footfalls, was completely inundated, making it difficult for motorists, especially two-wheeler riders, to travel on this stretch while also risking engine damage to vehicles. Some fourwheeler owners were also seen pushing their cards after water entered their vehicles. In the past, farmers had suffered immensely due to crop damage on account of the flooding that rendered their fields uncultivable. A local, Chetan Bandokar said that this is a recurring problem every year during the monsoon “Since this is a low-lying area, every year this area gets flooded due to the haphazard development work of the national highway expansion which is in progress. The authorities have failed to provide an outlet for the flow of water,” said Bandodkar. A commuter said to prevent his two-wheeler from getting damaged, he was forced to take an alternative route. Locals have sought the intervention of the local MLA and PWD minister to find a solution to this problem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/motorists-bear-brunt-as-guirim-road-goes-under/articleshow/84391495.cms||---

---||Delhi||Insurers to offer add-on cover for at-home Covid treatment, Delhi high court told||NEW DELHI: The insurance regulator Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) on Wednesday informed Delhi High Court that it had asked all the insurers to offer an “add on” cover insurance benefit for “homecare treatment” to Covid 19 patients. The regulator also told the court that, apart from the Corona Kavach policy, there were over 19 products offered as insurance policy by general and health insurers, which covered ancillary treatment of Covid-19. In its reply, IRDA added that it had issued a circular on June 21 this year advising insurers “to explore the feasibility of offering “homecare treatment or domiciliary treatment” as an add-on cover with the existing health insurance products to enable the policyholders to exercise the option of having these treatments in their existing policies, if such coverage was not available already. The response of IRDA came after the court in May had pointed out that many Covid-19 infected people would not be able to get insurance benefits as they could not secure a hospital bed due to the dearth of medical infrastructure. It had asked the sectoral regulator IRDA to look into the issue. IRDA added that it had laid down guidelines to cover scenarios where the condition of the customer was such that he/she was not in a condition to be moved to a hospital, or customer took treatment at home due to non-availability of room at a hospital. “If a person is diagnosed as Covid-positive and is admitted into any such make-shift or temporary hospital on the advice of a medical practitioner or appropriate government authorities, the treatment costs are required to be settled by insurers,” IRDA submitted in the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/insurers-to-offer-add-on-cover-for-at-home-covid-treatment-court-told/articleshow/84424078.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Chennai||Paddy seeds lead police to Tamil Nadu woman professor’s killer||CHENNAI: Two days after a ‘whodunnit’ murder mystery in which a 45-year-old woman professor was found dead inside a locked room a few minutes after she called her sister — who was staying in a different floor of the same house — on phone about some suspicious movement in her room, police on Tuesday arrested the killer with the help of a torn piece of shirt and paddy seeds found at the crime scene. According to police, the accused Sudhakar, 41, a teacher, who used to visit her late in the night for years by scaling parapet and crossing terraces of nearby homes to enter her room, had murdered her with a knife on Saturday after a spat with her over his other relationships. Anitha, a spinster, lived with her sister Shanmugakani, brother-in-law and her son at their house at Angalaparameswari Nagar, Orikkai, in Kancheepuram. She was working as a professor at a college in Enathur and stayed in a separate room on the first floor of the house. On Saturday night, after dinner, Anitha called her sister on phone saying she noticed some suspicious movement in her room. She was later found dead when her family members checked on her. The Kancheepuram Taluk police who visited the spot found the shirt piece and paddy seeds strewn in the room. Police zeroed in on a rice mill when they checked Anitha’s contacts list on her mobile phone. Probe revealed that she was in contact with the mill owner’s brother. According to police, and the accused came to the victim’s home directly from the mill and committed the crime. Police nabbed Sudhakar who confessed to his crime when confronted with evidence. Anitha was a teacher in a private school 10 years back when she came in contact with Sudhakar who was also a teacher at the school. Soon, Anitha became a professor, while Sudhakar got a job in a government school. Police said that though they worked in different places, they stayed in touch. Sudhakar, a father of two, developed a relationship with her. He frequented her house when her family was asleep. As she stayed in a separate room on the first floor, it was easy for him to scale the parapet and terrace of adjoining houses and reach her room through the back door. Recently, Sudhakar is believed to have developed contact with another women as well. Anitha, who was upset over this, asked him to stay away. On Saturday, Sudhakar entered Anitha’s room before she came in and hid himself. After a fight when she found him there, he stabbed her on the stomach and neck using a penknife and removed her jewellery worth six sovereigns. “Anitha managed to push him out of the house through the back door, latch it and called her sister’s family members who were on the first floor,” said an investigating officer. Anitha pretended as if there was some suspicious movement in her room and fainted. Anitha’s family broke open the door, found her dead and informed police. A couple of hours before the murder, she had spoken to the killer for more than an hour, police said. Sudhakar has been remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/paddy-seeds-lead-police-to-tn-woman-profs-killer/articleshow/84391390.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 30% kharif sowing gap against 5-year average||Mumbai: The two-week gap in the monsoon has resulted in kharif sowing lagging behind by 30% in Maharashtra compared to the five-year average, shows data. While officials say that sowing operations are accelerating with the monsoon picking up, so far sowing has taken place on 106 lakh hectares of the average kharif area of 151 lakh hectares. Only 53% of foodgrain sowing has taken place compared to the five-year average till July 12. “We had issued advisories to farmers to postpone sowing in view of the gap in the rains so they do not need to spend on a second round of sowing. Now that the rains have picked up, sowing will pick up,” said state agriculture secretary Eknath Davle. The sowing of paddy is 80% below the five-year average. So far, 2.9 lakh hectares of paddy has been sown compared to the average of 14.9 lakh hectares. “Paddy sowing will improve owing to good rainfall now in the Konkan. Since it is a transplanted crop, the sowing is expected to improve after July 15,” said Davle. Region-wise, sowing has been lowest in the Konkan, where only 22% of the kharif area has been sown. In North Maharashtra as well, sowing has taken place on just 53% of the kharif area. In the Nagpur division, sowing has taken place on 58% of the kharif area. In terms of crop sowing, there is a 63% gap in the sowing of cereals and 21% deficit in the sowing of pulses compared to the five-year average for the kharif season. Cotton sowing has covered 81% of the average kharif area but sugarcane sowing has been only 13% of the five-year average so far. Average cane sowing between 2014-15 and 2018-19 was 9.3 lakh hectares. So far this year it has been 1.2 lakh hectares. “Farmers in Konkan and the adivasi areas of North Maharashtra have been affected by the gap in the rains. With just two weeks left before the end of the sowing period for kharif, there isn’t much time left to catch up on the sowing lag,” said Ajit Navale from the Kisan Sabha, a union of farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-30-kharif-sowing-gap-against-5-year-average/articleshow/84391512.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Pushkar Dhami cancels kanwar yatra, says won’t play with people’s lives||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government on Tuesday evening finally decided not go ahead with the kanwar yatra. This ended days of speculation that the Pushkar Dhami-led government may reverse the decision taken by the previous Tirath Rawat administration on cancelling the yatra. “At a time when the threat of Covid-19 is still looming and a case of the Delta-plus variant has also been reported from Uttarakhand, we cannot allow Haridwar to become a hotbed of the pandemic,” Dhami said. “People’s lives are important and we cannot play around with them. It is important to save lives during a pandemic. Even god will not like it if any lives are lost.” This is the second year in succession that the kanwar yatra has been cancelled. Last year, too, the Trivendra Rawat government had decided not to hold the yatra in view of the Covid-19 situation. The decision was endorsed this year by the short-lived Tirath Rawat government. However, just a couple of days after Dhami took over as CM, there were speculations that Uttarakhand may after all allow the yatra. This was prompted by UP CM Yogi Adityanath dialing Dhami and requesting that kanwarias from UP should be allowed in limited numbers to come to Haridwar. The call had initially triggered the state government to reconsider its decision. A day after speaking with Yogi, Dhami conducted a meeting of senior officials and asked them to coordinate with neighbouring states like Delhi, UP and Haryana from where bulk of the kanwarias troop into Uttarakhand. During his subsequent visit to Delhi, he consulted with PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah on the issue even as experts back home cautioned that holding the yatra could have disastrous consequences. They pointed to the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar earlier this year and said Covid norms were violated with impunity. TOI had reported how even the tests that were done were marred by charges of fraud, with close to a lakh of the Covid examinations turning out to be fake or fixed. The government’s decision was welcomed by many. Dehradun-based social activist Anoop Nautiyal said, “The government of Uttarakhand has made a wise decision and taken a clear stand.

If everything goes well, theatre aficionados will get to see full-length English and Marathi plays, and a series of other performances in August. “On January 23 and 24, we presented Stagecraft Theatre’s 80th production, While We Were Walking, a romantic comedy in English. But the second wave struck soon after that and we had to stop all activities. Now, we are back,” said theatre veteran Vikash Khurana. “During the lockdown, we rehearsed online for 5 short plays, each of 20-minute duration. At least 25 young first-timers were introduced through this. We rehearsed in June as restrictions were lifted and planned to stage it on July 3. However, the restrictions are back,” said Khurana. Stagecraft has decided to bring these 5 plays in video format and have a YouTube launch next week. They are also rehearsing for a full length play. “This will be staged in August as we are expecting the situation to improve by then. We are ready to play in front of 50% capacity audience too,” said Khurana. The Sanjay Bhakre Foundation, which is known for bringing new talent on stage, is coming up with the full length Marathi play. “A two-act comedy in Marathi is all set to hit stage soon. I have invited young and passionate people to join us for it. Resuming theatre will prove an energy booster for the artists,” said Sanjay Bhakre. Even the South Central Zone Cultural Centre (SCZCC) premises will see some activities from August 9. “They will be on stage in the presence of an audience with all Covid protocols followed,” its director Deepak Khirwadkar. The SCZCC has planned a unique music competition for band groups which have faced a major setback during lockdown. “Every band party will play six patriotic songs and then the national anthem together. These musicians deserve this encouragement in the tough situation,” said Khirwadkar. It has also planned a Hindi Play ‘Azadi ki Aur’ for which artists of Rashtrabhasha Parivar are rehearsing at present. Bahujan Rangbhoomi, another leading theatre organization, has launched ‘casting call’ for their upcoming play. “Male and female artists of age groups are welcome to join and restart theatre. Freshers are most welcome,” said theatre activist Virendra Ganvir who heads this group. .....

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Face off between INTUC, WCL Chanda AGM||CHANDRAPUR: The Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) in Chandrapur WCL is on the warpath against new Area General Manager (AGM) Muhammad Sabir over charges of corruption, nexus with coal mafia, sexual harassment of women employees, biased approach towards employees etc. INTUC organizing secretary and senior trade union leader KK Singh of New Delhi has launched an indefinite hunger strike against the AGM. However, Sabir has completely sidelined the labour wing of Congress party, and refused to hold any dialogue with the union on any stage. Singh claimed that Rashtriya Koyla Khadan Majdoor Sangh (INTUC affiliated) is staging agitation since June 10, over corruption, issues of labours and illegal activities going on in the WCL area. Despite 15 days of protests, and 17 days of chain hunger strike, AGM Sabir has refused to have any dialogue with the union. “The management even went on to put pressure on police department to clear our agitation pandal. However, we have not bowed to the pressure tactics and have now launched an indefinite hunger strike,” said Singh. He claimed that even if he is arrested, he would continue his hunger strike in police station. The agitation notice served to WCL Chandrapur area alleges corruption via supply of poor grade coal to Mahagenco and other government industries, while providing higher grade than designated to private players. The notice also alleges corruption by supply of excess coal to private permit holders in their trucks while showing it less in weight, partiality in promotions, quarter allocation and dealing with allegations against employees, and sexual harassment of women employees. “When we raised these issues with AGM Sabir, he refused to have any dialogue with INTUC claiming internal dispute over title of union is pending with the court. However, the management is in dialogue with INTUC since last many years and has officially corresponded with the union till the arrival of new AGM. He, however, has particular allergy with INTUC and is adamant about not talking with us,” Singh charged. Sabir explained that he has got clear instructions from the company management that no official dialogue should be carried out with INTUC. “WCL management has shuted INTUC out of industrial relations following their internal dispute in the court. Therefore I have clear guidelines not to talk with INTUC on any official platform. However, we are ready to hear the grievances of our workers and have held talks with Singh personally on some issues,” he explained. Singh, who has full backing of Congress party here, said they have membership of one third of employees of WCL in Chandrpaur, and all these people cannot be ignored. He maintained that their hunger strike will continue until Chandrapur area management initiates talks with them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/face-off-between-intuc-wcl-chanda-agm/articleshow/84391458.cms||Mazhar Ali

It further said that while functioning as CEO Kerala, he shall not hold any additional charge whatsoever under the state government except that he should be designated as the secretary to the election department of the state. This is usually done so as to ensure budgetary support from the state government. However, it isn’t clear whether ECI would reconsider the decision in the wake of the state government’s request. The state government has requested the ECI to permit Kaul, who was appointed CEO, to retain additional charges in the state government, including as secretary (finance expenditure) and chairman and managing director of Kerala Financial Corporation (KFC). Usually, when an all-India service officer leaves the state on deputation either to the Centre, any autonomous body under the Centre, a constitutional body like ECI or to another state on inter-cadre deputation, the services of the officer in the state government is discontinued during that period. However, the state government had made an exceptional move, subject to the clearance from the ECI, to hand over the post of secretary (finance expenditure) and CMD, KFC, to Kaul who has taken over as CEO of the state. The state had taken such a step in the wake of an extreme shortage of senior officers in the ranks of secretaries and principal secretaries. The CEOs, who are representatives of ECI in the state, are selected by the commission from a panel of three officials. The commission considers their official records, their previous experience in the election process, etc, before picking one name. There have been instances when the commission had rejected all the names and had asked for fresh names. In the latest instance, reportedly due to the immense shortage of officials, the state had sent only two names to ECI. The commission chose Kaul, a 2001 batch officer in the rank of secretary, to the post as he had functioned as additional CEO during the recently-concluded assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/new-ceo-cant-serve-state-govt-says-eci-order/articleshow/84389132.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Delhi||When will super specialty hospital at Dwarka be ready?: Delhi HC to govt||NEW DELHI: People of Delhi require medical support, but the infrastructure is not enough, Delhi High Court observed on Wednesday and asked the AAP government when the Super Specialty Indira Gandhi Hospital in Dwarka would be ready, whose progress the court is monitoring. “You are shirking your responsibility to develop a super specialty hospital. Your endeavour to develop it should be imminent and now. People of Delhi need medical support, it is not enough, the infrastructure is not adequate,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh observed. The court’s remark came when the AAP government failed to clearly indicate timelines by when the hospital would be up and running. Instead, the government claimed, since the hospital was a Covid 19 dedicated facility, it was focused on ensuring there were enough beds with oxygen, ventilators, and other support staff. The government submitted an affidavit arguing that, “The hospital has been designated as a Covid one, the specialised facilities have not been planned to be started as of now, and when the institution will be declared a non-Covid facility, necessary arrangements will be considered to start the super specialty facility.” “Why is it only a Covid hospital? A corona patient also needs these specialities as there can be complications due to the disease, these are essential. It is not rocket science that you want to first run the Covid facility and see what can be learnt from it. A Covid facility doesn’t mean just oxygen and beds, it also means other specialities, and specialists are needed for treating patients, be it a pulmonologist, heart specialist or a nephrologist,” the bench pointed out. The court made it clear that mere declaration of 1,241-bed Indira Gandhi Hospital as a Covid-19 dedicated facility should not postpone the development of specialised facilities as they would also be necessary for treatment of other ailments of patients during their stay. “We direct the government to file a better affidavit indicating the timeline within which the super specialities will be set up, since, in our view, this will not be at cross purposes with dedication of the hospital as an exclusive Covid facility,” the bench noted. It underlined that, “We are still apprehensive of the third wave. We do not know when it will come, how it will be, will it require hospitalisation. All we are telling you is that your decision not to develop super specialties now is incorrect.” “We definitely want to know the outer timeline and do not want to keep it open ended, else we know it will never be completed” the bench said and listed the matter for hearing on August 2. Advocate Y P Singh, representing petitioner Dwarka Court Bar Association, said, despite clear direction of the court, the government had not come with clean hands and was misleading the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-to-govt-when-will-super-specialty-hospital-at-dwarka-be-ready/articleshow/84424124.cms||Abhinav Garg

The ceremony to welcome him back to the party took place in Chandigarh, with prominent AAP leaders, including MP Bhagwant Mann, Punjab affairs in-charge Raghav Chadha and MLA Balwinder Kaur, in attendance. Speaking to the media, Bhola said, “I had joined the Congress after senior leaders assured me that my area, which lacks even the basic infrastructure, will be developed. But none of the promises was kept, forcing me to call it quits. I have rejoined the AAP, which is the only solution to the dirty politics being played in the state by other parties, like Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal and BJP.” The AAP leadership received him with open arms. Bhagwant Mann said, “People from all walks of life in Punjab are joining the AAP as they are impressed by the pro-people policies of the party and the work of Arvind Kejriwal’s Delhi government. Bhola is well-known in Ludhiana. He has been a councillor for long and his wife, Balwinder Kaur Grewal, is also serving as a councillor. His and his associates’ joining has given the AAP strength in the industrial city of Ludhiana.” Raghav Chadha said, “Bhola is loved by the people of Ludhiana.

While all the legislators had visited Delhi a few days back, this trip involved members of the party’s coordination committee. The first meeting was held with the AICC general secretary KC Venugopal which was followed by a meeting with Rahul Gandhi. Another round of meeting with the national leaders is scheduled for Wednesday. In these meetings, the national leaders individually met former CM Harish Rawat, state chief Pritam Singh, deputy leader of opposition Karan Mahra and AICC secretary Qazi Nizamuddin. In these meetings, they asked the state leaders about the key factors before the party in Uttarakhand, points to be included in the manifesto, the functioning of the present government, performance in respective assembly and required preparations for the 2022 assembly polls. Leader of opposition Indira Hridayesh had expired on June 13 and since then the key post has been lying vacant. On a number of occasions, state Congress members have visited Delhi but could not arrive on a consensus. Sources maintained that while a new leader of opposition is to be named, a section of party seniors are also pushing for a new state chief in Uttarakhand. The camps of Harish Rawat and Pritam Singh are pushing the name of their team members for the two key positions. As a result, more than four seniors are in race for the post of state chief and leader of opposition. AICC secretary Qazi Nizamuddin, who is in Delhi, told TOI, “There is no delay in the process. It would have been a concern if there was an assembly session underway or scheduled during this period. The party will take a call after consultation.” On being asked about a change of state leadership, he did not deny possibilities saying, “It is in the hands of national leadership. Change is nothing unusual, it is done while keeping several factors in mind.” Deputy leader of opposition Karan Mahra maintained that the party is expected to make major announcements in the next few days. “Some party members who could not meet national leaders on Monday met them on Tuesday and gave their feedback on various issues,” Mahra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/top-ukhand-cong-leaders-in-delhi-new-leader-of-opposition-to-be-announced-soon/articleshow/84386727.cms||Kautilya Singh

The state went for a payment of the longest duration of 30 years. Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand and West Bengal also raised bonds. All these states took loans with interest repayment schedule of seven to 10 years, unlike Telangana. Besides Telangana, other states on long duration schedule are Bihar (15 years) and AP (14). Telangana also fixed a slightly higher interest rate (7.24%) than other states, which kept it in the range of 6.95% to 7%. Meanwhile, the state will also go for another round of auction to raise Rs 1,000 crore this month end as per schedule given to RBI.

The FIR has been lodged on the statement of ASI Jasbir Singh. The ASI said, “On Monday, more than 100 people gathered at Rahon Road, near Gehlewal crossing, after a truck killed a man. They blocked the vehicular movement and set the truck on fire. Thereafter, the mob pelted cops with stones and bricks. A brick hit Meharban police station SHO sub-inspector Simranjit Kaur on face.

---||Patna||Bihar minister reiterates demand for multipurpose high dam in Nepal||PATNA: State water resources department (WRD) minister Sanjay Kumar Jha on Tuesday pitched for the construction of multipurpose high dam in Nepal as a way to permanent solution to floods in Bihar, and also called for a “reconsideration” of the issues related to the Farakka barrage across the Ganga, as well as the interstate and international sharing of its water. He also hoped that India and Nepal would realise the problem of floods in the north Bihar districts and resume their talks so that obstacles in the way of the construction of the high dam are removed. The last time steps were initiated for inter-government talks between India and Nepal was in 2004. Incidentally, Jha’s observations gain significance in the context of the present situation in Nepal, as its president Bidya Devi Bhandari on Tuesday appointed Sher Bahadur Deuba as the country’s new PM. “For a permanent solution to the floods in large parts of Bihar, the construction of a high dam on the important rivers in Nepal is necessary. On this issue, talks between Indian and Nepal governments have been going on for decades, but no desired result has yet come,” Jha tweeted. “If there is heavy rainfall in Nepal, the rivers bring water and silt that create a deluge-like situation,” Jha added. He also said rivers like Gandak, Bagmati, Kamla, Kosi, Mahananda, “along with several other rivers taking water from Nepal descend into north Bihar and fall in the Ganga in the middle of Bihar.”  Back in 2016, the Nitish Kumar government had organized seminars involving experts at Patna and Delhi on the issues related to the Farakka barrage. “Bihar has been demanding reconsideration of the issue related to drainage capacity of Farakka barrage, and also the interstate and international sharing of water of the Ganga,” Jha said, adding: “Since the construction of Farakka barrage, silt is getting deposited on the riverbed of Ganga, which has affected the unencumbered flow of the river.” Meanwhile, the discharge of water through the Birpur barrage across Kosi in Supaul district, bordering Nepal, increased from 1.48 lakh cusecs in the morning to 1.74 lakh cusecs in the afternoon, due to the rainfall received in Nepal. The water discharge through Valmiki Nagar barrage was falling very slowly – from 1.61 lakh cusecs in the morning to 1.58 lakh cusecs in the afternoon. While the water level of the river Bagmati was rising, the Burhi Gandak has been flowing above the danger level along its downstream in Muzaffarpur, Samastipur and Khagaria districts. Among the major rivers, the Ganga and Mahananda were still flowing below the danger mark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/wrd-minister-reiterates-demand-for-multipurpose-high-dam-in-nepal/articleshow/84386770.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Dehradun||Four Nepalese women living in shelter homes in Dehradun, reunited with families||DEHRADUN: Four Nepalese inmates living in Dehradun’s Baalika Niketan and Naari Niketan were handed over to their families today who resided in Nepal. Of the four, two were mentally ill. The move comes after the Nepal embassy at Delhi gave clearance and permission to the women and child department of Uttarakhand to hand over these women to their respective families. The four include two teenagers – a 19-year-old from Dharcula and a 17-year-old from Rolpa – and two adults, a 30-year-old hailing from Kanchanpur and a 32-year-old from Sunsari, according to information provided by the district probation officer of Dehradun, Meena Bisht. The teenagers were working in India as domestic help and out of the two older women with mental health issues, one was abandoned by her husband and the other got lost while visiting Bihar for treatment. “One of them completed her inter-school under our aegis while others have trained themselves through our various skill development courses. We hope their families in Nepal will take good care of them and utilize their talent,” said Rekha Arya, the minister for women and child development. The youngest inmate who spent 9.5 years at the shelter home was very emotional while leaving, as she had made many friends at the Baalika Niketan. She was rescued from Tehri two months ago where she was pushed into domestic labour. “I will remember all my friends here,” she said at a formal programme organised by department officials. Help Cross, an NGO based in Doiwala in Dehradun, played a vital role in reuniting these women with their families. Speaking to TOI Vishal Thapa, secretary of Help Cross, said, “We connected with their families through video conferencing, they identified them and only then we got in touch with the embassy for further paperwork to reunite these women,” The family members of mentally-ill women had identified them and agreed to keep them while the two younger women identified their parents on video call and expressed their desire to go back to them. Currently, Baalika Niketan is home to 23 girls under the age of 18 while Naari Niketan provides care to 113 women including some who are mentally ill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/four-nepalese-women-living-in-shelter-homes-reunited-with-families/articleshow/84386738.cms||Shivani Azad

Much of these betel nuts are being smuggled into the Indian mainland through sea route evading various duties and taxes running into crores of rupees. Apart from tax evasion, smuggling of sub-standard betel nuts from Indonesia is also affecting business of local traders. According to official sources, instead of Myanmar port and then through north-east roadways via Guwahati, some traders are procuring sub-standard betel nuts from Indonesia at cheaper rates via Sri Lanka. Sources stated the substandard betel nuts are brought to Sri Lanka from Indonesia due to low import duty. Fake documents are prepared to show the betel nuts as grown locally in Sri Lanka. From Sri Lanka, betel nuts are brought to JNPT in Navi Mumbai from where they are distributed to different parts of India including Nagpur which is considered the biggest hub in central India. In Nagpur, the betel nuts are processed by smoking it with sulphur dioxide and then cut into pieces before flavouring, scenting and colouring it to make it base material for tobacco products. Experts like senior onco surgeon Dr Sudhir Deshmukh stating that Central India is the worst hit region in the country as far as tobacco-related cancer is concerned. Dr Deshmukh said the youngest patient he has seen was an eight-year-old who had started chewing tobacco while preparing ‘kharra’ for his father at their family’s pan kiosk. “Betel nut is commonly consumed with tobacco like sweetened supari. These can damage oral cavity, esophagus, throat, stomach and lungs,” he said. “Chewing betel nuts over a long period of time can cause trauma to the oral cavity which can turn problematic in due course of time,” he said. As per the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) records, 77 betel nut samples were collected from different godowns in the district between April last year and March this year. Around 18 samples tasted sub-standard and 23 unsafe for consumption. Materials worth around Rs 5.41 crore were seized too. “Some betel nut traders take advantage of weak legislations to continue their trade but some have also faced repeated actions,” said an FDA official. Despite action from FDA and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), insider sources stated that some unscrupulous traders have continued their illegal business. The CBI had for the first time conducted raids last month to crack down on the betel nut smugglers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/betel-nut-smuggled-to-city-from-sri-lanka-via-mumbai-port/articleshow/84391473.cms||Soumitra Bose

In Uttarkashi, the Gangotri and Yamunotri highways were blocked. The regional Met centre has issued an orange alert and predicted that rains will continue in the state for at least another week. Haldwani in Nainital district received the maximum of 150mm rainfall till Tuesday morning, followed by hill town Mussoorie, which recorded 100mm showers, Chakrata received 80mm rains, Barkot 70mm, Dhanaulti 50mm and Pithoragarh 30mm. The rain in Mussoorie started on Saturday and recurrent landslides on the Mussoorie-Dehradun road started the next day, uprooting trees and causing roadblocks. However, PWD managed to keep clearing the debris to restore traffic. On Tuesday, a landslide near Indira Bhawan, Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA), blocked the road leading to the campus. Another landslide was reported at a residential area in Hussainganj, posing risk to nearby buildings. “We have deployed several JCBs to clear the roads so that traffic flow remains smooth,” a PWD official told. Meanwhile, water supply was disrupted in Lanodur. Some trees were uprooted due to continuous rain near the Kolti water pumping station on Monday morning, damaging electricity lines. The repair work could not be completed by evening and water supply could not be restored. “We will provide water to affected localities and hope to resume regular supply by Wednesday morning,” Trepan Singh Rawat, assistant engineer of Jal Sansthan, said. In Uttarkashi, Gangotri highway was blocked early in the morning due to landslides at Dabrani and Raturisera areas and the Yamunotri highway was blocked at Paligad area. These were opened up later in the day. Besides, more than two dozen rural roads of the district were blocked by landslides, disconnecting several villages from the district headquarters. Electricity supply was disrupted in five villages of Mori region. Devendra Patwal, district disaster management officer, said, “Most of the roads, including Gangotri and Yamunotri highways, are now open for traffic movement. Barring a few areas, road connectivity and electricity supply has been restored in the villages.” The Met centre issued an orange alert of heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places in Dehradun, Haridwar, Pauri, Uttarkashi, Nainital and Tehri districts of Uttarakhand on Tuesday. A yellow alert has been issued for heavy rainfall in all hill districts of the state till July 17. Districts of Kumaon region like Almora, Nainital and Pithoragarh will receive heavy rains on July 14. “Rainfall will continue in Uttarakhand till July 20, with chances of very heavy to extremely heavy showers on July 18 and 19,” said Bikram Singh, director, Met centre. The Met also issued a warning for minor to medium landslides and rock falls at isolated places and vulnerable areas in the hill. It said the water level of rivulets and seasonal streams could also rise due to rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/heavy-rains-lash-uttarakhand-causing-landslides-in-mussoorie-highways-blocked/articleshow/84386771.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Goa||Blocked drain floods Old Goa heritage area, moisture grips Basilica walls||Panaji: Old Goa’s core area on the eastern side of the world heritage complex flooded following extremely heavy rainfall. Dampness has once again gripped the walls of the popular Basilica of Bom Jesus. Blocked drainage near the Mahatma Gandhi circle caused inundation of the surrounding area and the stretch leading to the Hat Khatro Khamba on the Panaji-Old Goa highway. The storm water drain carries a massive flow from the deforested buffer zone of the heritage site and newly concretised Kadamba plateau past the basilica to the Mandovi. The water entered a few houses, but it was the damp conditions at the Basilica edifice that raised concerns among heritage lovers. “The rain water doesn’t percolate at the plateau level but flows down the hill and rises up the Basilica walls due to capillary action,” a Jesuit priest and rector at the basilica, Fr Patricio Fernandes said. In recent years, the 17th century church housing the sacred relics of St Francis Xavier — at the lowest level on the drainage route in the area — has been faced with adverse conditions caused by rise in water level. The new threat in the heritage area already plagued by illegal constructions and unplanned development is the increased volume of rain water due to loss of green cover. Experts had called for an expeditious initiative to tackle the problem of Old Goa’s changed watershed and hydrology. Water stagnation in some areas caused hardship to a few residents. “Every time vehicles passed by the water was displaced into our house,” a resident near Gandhi circle, Alzira Dias said. At another spot, a submerged road blocked access to occupants of a bungalow near the steelyard. “We had raised the issue of desilting the nullahs and covering them to prevent plastic littering at the gram sabha,” local activist Glean Cabral said. Water resources department has belatedly assured to carry out the cleaning of the drains. “They have assured to take up the task soon and the priority is to clear the way to allow water to flow to the river,” Fernandes said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/blocked-drain-floods-old-goa-heritage-area-moisture-grips-basilica-walls/articleshow/84391658.cms||Paul Fernandes

The deceased include two kids and a newly married couple. Sources at the scene informed that the Lashkare family, headed by contractor Ramesh Lashkare, lived in ward no. 3 of Durgapur. Being rainy season, power supply in the area was disrupted sometime in the night. It is assumed, Ramesh Lashkare started the petrol-fueled electricity generator to get power supply, and the entire family comprising seven members slept peacefully. As the only door and all the windows in the house were closed, the exhaust gas comprising carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide emitted by the generator accumulated in the house. All the family members suffocated due to the exhaust gas and six of them died in their sleep. The matter came to light when none of the family members came out of the house till late in the morning. The neighbours tried to wake up the Lashkares but nobody responded from inside. Concerned neighbours broke the door open and were shocked to find the entire house filled with poisonous smoke from the generator exhaust. All the family members were lying motionless where they slept. Alarmed neighbours immediately informed Durgapur police and PI Swapnil Dhule rushed to the spot with his team. Cops immediately moved all the family members to hospital, where six of them were declared brought dead. The deceased include Ramesh Lashkare (45), his newly-wed son Ajay Lashkare (20), Ajay’s wife Madhuri Lashkare (20), Lakhan Lashkare (10), Krushna Lashkare (8) and Puja Lashkare (14). Ramesh’s wife Dasu (40) however survived the disaster and was admitted to a private hospital. However, she was later shifted to ICU in civil hospital at Chandrapur as her condition was critical. Neighbours said that Ramesh Lashkare had got married just 10 days back and the newly-wed couple succumbed to poisonous gas in the incident. PI Dhule confirmed the six deaths and said that all of them appeared to have died of inhaling poisonous exhaust fumes emitted from the generator. “All the ventilations in the house were closed leading to accumulation of the gas,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/six-of-family-die-in-sleep-due-to-exhaust-fumes-from-generator/articleshow/84391533.cms||Mazhar Ali

Bindu K of Attukal near Manacaud in Thiruvananthapuram withdrew the petition after a division bench pointed out that a habeas corpus plea is not the petition that has to be filed to release a person detained abroad and that the petitioner should approach a single bench. The petitioner then withdrew the habeas corpus plea so as to approach a single bench. Nimisha was detained by Afghanistan authorities after her husband, who was allegedly an ISIS fighter, had died in a fight. Her mother had contended in the plea that by abandoning Nimisha and other Indian women detained in Afghanistan, the Indian government is inadvertently bolstering the falsehoods being propagated by radical outfits. Not repatriating Nimisha and the granddaughter amounts to violation of fundamental right to life and denial of right to education to the granddaughter, the petitioner had alleged. The mother’s plea had said that Nimisha can be subject to due process of law upon her return whereas the granddaughter can be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society. In June this year, central government had denied Afghanistan’s request for deportation of the Indian women and children, the petition had stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nimishas-mother-withdraws-plea-in-hc/articleshow/84389210.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal cinema halls wait for new releases||BHOPAL: The cinema halls except a few like Bharat Talkies may still remain closed despite the state government giving a go ahead to cinema halls and multiplexes to start operations at 50% capacity. The same thing applies to multiplexes as well. “Where is the content to show? Unless the Hindi films start releasing, cinema halls can’t open”, said Bunny Singh, owner of Rangmahal-Sangeet Cineplex. When asked when the new films are likely to release, he said “When there is unlock in the entire country.” Secretary of Bhopal Cine Association, Aziz Ahmed, also said, “How can the cinema halls open? There are no films to show and old films are not seen by people in cinema halls.” When asked about the release of new films, he said “It’s only after Mumbai unlocks that the films will start releasing because Mumbai accounts for 37% of Hindi film business.” Ashwini Agrawal of Bharat Cineplex, who had opened his cinema hall in the unlock after Diwali the previous year, is going to open his cinema hall for the public again. When asked what he will show to the spectators, he said “There is a problem with content, no doubt. But, a beginning will have to be made. We shall get some old films. Films like Radhe can be shown.” When asked whether his cinema hall will have the normal four regular shows during the day, he said “Let’s see how people respond. We shall decide accordingly.” The cinema hall with a capacity of 1000 people, gets only a few viewers at times, causing Agrawal to reduce shows during the day or keep the cinema hall closed on some days. Some screens of multiplexes may also open for the public. Amber Saxena of Ionex, which has screens at Capital Mall, said that they are eager to open the screens for public viewing. He, too, admitted that content would be a problem but said, “We have content from the south and the east. We shall use it for the time being. But, we are eager and people are eager too, to view films in multiplexes, therefore we shall start operations while following the Covid protocol.” Sanitization after each show, disinfection of the surface including electrostatic disinfection, which keeps the surface free of virus for 90 days, cashless transactions as much as possible, no-touch delivery of snacks, confirming ticket over mobile rather than giving actual tickets are some of the measures he spelled out to ensure protection of the spectators. Multiplexes at DB Mall would, however, take some days to open up and it’s not sure as to how many of the screens at the malls would be in operation. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cinema-halls-wait-for-new-releases/articleshow/84389169.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Dehradun||Kingpin of Tau gang arrested along with four more members in Haridwar jewellery heist case||HARIDWAR: The joint team of Haridwar police and Special Task Force (STF) claimed to have solved the case of robbery at Mora Tara Jewellers with the arrest of five more members of the notorious ‘Tau gang’ today, including its kingpin, Satish Chaudhary. The police have also recovered valuables worth Rs 80 lakh from them. Earlier, cops had arrested three accused in connection with the Rs 2 crore robbery at Mora Tara jewellers, considered to be the biggest heist in the history of Haridwar. According to the police, Satish is a notorious criminal and is wanted in eight states including Delhi, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The robbers had used an ambulance to escape from Haridwar after committing the crime. The arrested robbers have been identified as Satish Chaudhary, Satendra Pal, Sanjay alias Raju (all three from Bulandshahr), Amit alias Fauji and Nitin Malik (both from Shamli). Meanwhile, Vikas alias Himanshu from Rohini, Delhi and Pradesh Rathor alias Jacky also from Bulandshahr are still absconding. Addressing a press conference at Jwalapur police station, senior superintendent of police, Senthil Avoodai Krishna Raj S, said the gang was notorious all over north India for committing robberies. It had been active for around 25 years and was originally headed by Inderpal Chaudhary, who was arrested a few years ago and is currently lodged in Bulandshahr jail. After his arrest, his nephew Satish took over the reins and divided responsibilities like collecting information, ‘recruiting’ new members, planning escape routes etc. The gang was named after the new kingpin’s uncle or ‘tau’. Sources said the members called each other ‘tau’. According to the police, the gang worked like a corporate company and had a professional approach to crime. The gang reportedly planned the Haridwar heist for one and half years. The robbery was initially planned for Kolkata, said circle officer, Abhay Singh, who led the operation. “But due to lockdown and other logistical problems Satish had to postpone the Kolkata plan and instead focused on Haridwar. Amit Fauji, a senior member of the gang, recruited new members, like Sanjay alias Raju, for the robbery. Sanjay used to be a constable in the Uttar Pradesh Police but was terminated from his service after getting convicted for murder in 2007. He was currently out on parole. The gang had kept a number of escape routes ready but in the end, it fled using an ambulance. But we managed to nab most of the accused successfully,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kingpin-of-tau-gang-arrested-along-with-four-more-members-in-haridwar-jewellery-heist-case/articleshow/84386831.cms||---

A total of around 3.75 lakh doses of covisheild vaccine have been allocated to these 24 districts namely Harda, Hoshangabad, Raisen, Rajgarh, Sehore, Vidisha, Alirajpur, Burhanpur, Indore, Khandwa, Ashok Nagar, Datia, Sheopur, Shivpuri, Gwalior, Dindori, Jabalpur, Sagar, Dewas, Neemuch, Ratlam, Ujjain, Rewa and Shahdol districts. In the remaining districts, maintenance of cold chain equipment and training will be provided, besides, if there is any available vaccines in stock, then vaccination may be carried out, said sources. Sources from the department said that the focus is now on those districts where the percentage of vaccination is less compared to the other districts, in a bid to boost up the vaccination numbers so that the coverage is even across the state, mass vaccination drive will only be carried out in these 24 districts. In state capital Bhopal it is likely that the vaccination of covaxin is carried out but at a small scale around 2500 doses of the vaccines will be administered, said sources. Mega vaccination drive was carried out in the state from June 21. So far over 90 lakh doses of vaccines have been administered since June 21, the drive has also led to removing vaccine hesitancy among the people, thus crowd is often observed at the vaccination centres, added sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/3-75l-vac-doses-to-be-given-in-24-dists-today/articleshow/84389205.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Citizens recreate water channel, give lake new life||BENGALURU: The target seemed impossible: Reclaiming a 4.5-km-long channel lost to encroachments decades ago and enabling it to carry water into a lake downstream within 100 days. But when it was accomplished, leaving Bathalakere lake near Anekal on the southeast fringes of the city, brimming with water, everyone was thrilled. Bathalakere lake is now the cynosure of all eyes as its makeover is testimony to a unique model where citizens supervised and executed the work while authorities provided logistical support. Coming at a time when infrastructure projects in Bengaluru take multiple years to near completion, the effective partnership between residents and the Bengaluru Urban district administration is a pointer to how projects can be accomplished seamlessly. The lake is now getting water through natural gravitational flow from Muthalanur lake. “Bathalakere had been part of Bengaluru’s interconnected lake network, where water from a brimming lake flowed into another downstream. Bathalakere was getting water from Muthalanur lake and its water was supposed to overflow to Bidaruguppe lake before entering Tamil Nadu. But there have been so many encroachments in recent years that the rajakaluves (water drains) have disappeared,” said Capt Santosh Kumar, a retired military intelligence officer and Muthanalur resident. Kumar, 43, has been spearheading a campaign for saving lakes for the last four years in Anekal taluk and has been instrumental in protecting around a dozen waterbodies in the district. “The first challenge was to recreate the network of water channels which had been taken over by encroachers. We started writing to the CM and different departments, collected old maps that had lakes and water channels, roped in survey department officials and started tracing the rajakaluves on the ground,” Kumar said. In the meantime, residents of seven villages around the lake got together under the banner of Bruhat Muthanalur Residents’ Forum and other voluntary organisations joined the cause. The civic movement received a shot in the arm when IAS officer J Manjunath took over as deputy commissioner of Bengaluru Urban district and expedited the process of conducting surveys and marking boundaries for the water channel. There was resistance from a few encroachers, but the district administration cleared them with police protection. In fact, Bescom too installed 12 electric poles and a transformer unit on the rajakaluve. After getting the green signal, desilting work commenced. The residents’ forum and other donors sponsored rentals for the hired excavators and other earth-digging equipment while lake activists monitored civil work. “We started work in March this year and have completed it now. The silt is also being used by farmers in their fields and the restored rajakaluve has been handed back to the district administration,” said Kumar who donned the role of project manager. “If the government had to execute the project, a contractor would have been engaged and the cost would have come up to Rs 2 crore. But here, we civilians and donors completed the 4.5-km project with less than Rs 50 lakh,” he added. The team will focus on creating a 1.5-km water channel from Bathalakere to Bidaruguppe lake in the coming days .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/citizens-recreate-water-channel-give-lake-new-life/articleshow/84388355.cms||---

Accordingly, the revised prices of CNG inclusive of all taxes in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) will be Rs 51.98 per kg, while piped gas rates will escalate to Rs30.40 per unit (slab 1) and Rs 36 per unit (slab 2). This is the second hike for consumers in Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan, Vasai-Virar and Navi Mumbai in five months. Earlier in February, the price of CNG was hiked by Rs1.50 per kg while domestic PNG (cooking gas) increased by 95 paise per unit. “The hike has been done in order to partially cover the increase in operational costs and additional expenditure due to increase in gas pipeline transportation costs,” Mahanagar Gas Limited (MGL) spokesperson Neera Asthana-Phate said. She further said after the revision, CNG still offers savings of about 67% and 47% as compared to petrol and diesel at current price levels in Mumbai. The price of petrol and diesel has witnessed a series of hikes lately, with petrol now retailing at Rs 107.20 per litre in Mumbai, while the revised diesel rate is Rs 97.29 per litre.

Meanwhile, a man who owns a shop at Kempty Falls has tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. Hundreds of tourists huddling in a small pool at the waterfall without masks had gone viral a few days ago, after which the administration put curbs in place. The youth tested positive in a Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) done at the Civil hospital on Tuesday, said Dr Pradeep Rana, who oversees Covid testing and vaccination at the hospital. “His sample has been sent for an RT-PCR test. The district administration of Tehri has been informed,” Dr Rana told. On Monday, a shopkeeper from Landour’s Char Dukan and two of his family members had also tested positive in a RAT. However, their RT-PCR results have returned negative. According to Dr Rana, on Tuesday, 12 RAT tests and 170 RT-PCR tests were done. Fresh cases of Covid-19 cropping up at Mussoorie’s tourist spots have triggered panic among local residents. They had expressed concerns about tourists moving around without masks. Meanwhile on Tuesday, PM Narendra Modi tweeted saying while it was crucial for tourism to get back in business, large crowds of tourists without masks at hill stations was not justified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kempty-falls-reopens-shopkeeper-tests-covid-positive/articleshow/84386804.cms||Anmol Jain

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Lexicon editor row: Guv seeks report||Thiruvananthapuram: Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has sought a report from Kerala University vice-chancellor VP Mahadevan Pillai on a complaint that the university had appointed an ineligible candidate as the editor of Malayalam lexicon, allegedly under the influence of chief minister’s office (CMO). The report was sought based on a complaint submitted by the Save Education Campaign Committee alleging nepotism in the appointment of H Poornima, wife of R Mohanan, a former IRS officer who is currently working as the officer on special duty at CMO. It has been alleged that Poornima, a Sanskrit teacher with the Sanskrit university in Kalady was selected as the editor of Malayalam lexicon by tweaking the qualification norms to suit the particular candidate. Meanwhile, the campaign committee, on Tuesday, petitioned the state police chief, seeking an investigation into the alleged criminal conspiracy charges against Pillai and former registrar CR Prasad. Based on a proposal by the VC, the university’s syndicate on December 29, 2020, had decided to appoint a professor or associate professor as the Malayalam lexicon editor on a deputation basis. Though university statues prescribe that only a Malayalam expert can be considered for the post, the university notification issued in this regard said it can be either a Malayalam or Sanskrit faculty. According to Save University Campaign Committee, this addition was carried out by the former registrar who also acted as one of the two experts who declared Poornima as the only candidate eligible for the post. The committee further added that the notification was kept private so that only the candidate of their choice would get the posting. They also alleged that the university hid the complete address of Poornima and did not mention the deputation period in her appointment order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/lexicon-editor-row-guv-seeks-report/articleshow/84389267.cms||---

Khadse resigned as revenue minister on June 4, 2016.In October last year, Khadse joined the NCP and he is currently under investigation by the Enforcement Directorate over the Bhosari land deal. All along, Khadse has contended that the land belonged to a private person and that the acquisition process was never complete, so there was nothing illegal in the purchase of land by his wife and son-in-law.Justice Zoting pointed out that purchase of the land, which was already vested in the state free from all encumbrances, was a move made by Khadse “to defeat law and the notified purpose of the acquisition.” “It is well settled that no legitimacy can be conferred on abuse of power to advance private purpose,” the commission stated. “Khadse has used his official/political position either for personal financial gains or for personal gains of wife and son-in-law. He breached the oath of secrecy as he used the information related to MIDC land either for his personal gain or for the benefit of his close relatives, wife and son-in-law instead of helping the original owner in getting compensation and violated the code of conduct. Under such circumstances, the land deal in the name of wife and son-in-law involves conflict of interest,” Justice Zoting observed.Once land stands vested absolutely in the government free from encumbrances under the MIDC Act, it cannot be divested. The MIDC had allotted the Bhosari land to 14 companies for establishing industries, and these industries were functioning there, so the original owners had no title to the land.Further, Justice Zoting pointed out that evidence revealed that Khadse took actions which were “derogatory, prejudicial or injurious” to the interest of the government. “Khadse’s acts of commissions and omissions would have resulted in substantial loss to the government. If the outcry of people is (sic) not published in the media,” he remarked. The judge said that from the beginning, Khadse was aware of the land deal, but took a false stand, saying he was innocent.Justice Zoting further stated that under the MIDC Act, the revenue minister has no place in the process and Khadse was not a member of MIDC. Despite this, he convened a meeting of MIDC officials on April 12, 2016 for considering transfer of the land in the name of his wife and son-in-law, without any authority, In doing so, Khadse usurped the jurisdiction of the industries department. “If the purpose is corrupt, the resultant act is bad, if the considerations foreign to the scope of power or extraneous to the statute enter the action, malafides or fraud on power vitiates the official act. Khadse has abused his official position as revenue minister by calling the meeting for facilitating transfer of land in question vested in government in favour of his wife and son-in-law,” the judge observed.Khadse was the custodian of all government land, including the land in question, which is vested in the government, but his role in respect of this land results in transaction of sale in favour of wife and son-in-law in contravention of law, which is violation of public trust, the commissioner said. “The whole conduct of Khadse disentitles him to be a minister, he did acts unbecoming of a minister,” Justice Zoting said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-land-deal-in-name-of-khadses-kin-involves-conflict-of-interest/articleshow/84391645.cms||---

Following the CM’s instructions, additional chief secretary Anand Bardhan directed officials to ensure all clearances are done by August 15. The move has been initiated to ensure that the approved projects are completed before the state goes to the polls. A number of development projects have already been approved and budgets were allocated, too. According to political observers, as Dhami has taken over the rein barely a few months ahead of the upcoming assembly elections, the priority is not only starting development works, but also completing them before the polls. The CM has also approved budgets for various development projects in different assembly constituencies, including Khanpur, Tehri Rudrapur, Doiwala and Dharampur. Besides, a budget was also approved for the road projects in Kumaon and Garhwal districts, said officials. Meanwhile, chief secretary SS Sandhu held a virtual meeting with district magistrates and directed them to complete all pending works, at the earliest. Sandhu, however, told the DMs that though completing the pending works within a stipulated time was crucial, there should be no compromise on the quality of work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/with-ukhand-polls-approaching-cm-directs-officials-to-expedite-work/articleshow/84386888.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: On eve of 10th anniv of 2011 blasts, charges framed against Bhatkal||Mumbai: On the eve of the 10-year anniversary of Mumbai triple blasts that claimed 27 lives, a special MCOCA court on Monday framed charges against the alleged mastermind, Yasin Bhatkal, lodged in Tihar jail. He was produced for the hearing via video-conferencing. Due to their alleged involvement in other cases, some among the 11 accused have been lodged in separate jails across the country. The trial in a case commences only after charges are framed against the accused. During Monday’s hearing, Bhatkal insisted on being produced for the framing of charges in person. The court noted he had not mentioned the grounds for such a plea. Bhatkal, though, iterated his physical attendance is a must and another accused also lodged in Tihar jail was produced during the framing of his charges. It was then brought to the court’s notice that an order under Section 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) had been passed because of which Bhatkal could not be transferred from his jail for security reasons. It was pointed out that no such order existed against the other accused named by him. The court, in its order, also noted that opportunities had been given to him for a fair trial. “Otherwise, on account of his earlier successive refusals to hear the charge, I would have proceeded further. I also instructed him that due to such behaviour of accused persons, the trial is not proceeding at its required pace,” the court noted. Eventually, Bhatkal relented. The court read out the charges and subsequently framed them against him. Bhatkal pleaded not guilty. Charges were also framed against another accused, Ajaz Saeed Shaikh. The charges attract a maximum sentence of death. Both Bhatkal and Ajaz were earlier sentenced to death in another case.  Police alleged Bhatkal had sent explosives from Delhi, and Naqi Ahmed received them. They added Naqi stole one of the scooters in which a bomb was planted. The chargesheet says, “The entire criminal conspiracy was hatched by Riyaz Bhatkal and Yasin Bhatkal”, who are “the chief cogs of the notorious” Indian Mujahideen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-on-eve-of-10th-anniv-of-2011-blasts-charges-framed-against-bhatkal/articleshow/84393651.cms||Rebecca Samervel

And the reason is bizarre: The NMC’s enforcement department has named two employees — one who died a couple of years ago and another has retired two years back. The deployment of manpower in the cell was okayed by additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi. Like every year, the NMC formed a disaster management cell to extend timely help in case of an emergency in the city during monsoon. For expeditious action, it also formed zone-wise teams and around 220 officials from across various NMC departments have been deployed on the cell. The cell, which was activated on June 1, will remain vigilant till September 30, 2021. Deputy municipal commissioner (enforcement) named hawaldar Anil Chauhan and mazdoor Prabhakar Ambekar to address emergency calls for the June 1-September 30, 2021 duration and were supposed to remain on duty from 8am to 8pm. The cell, monitored by the NMC’s fire and emergency services department, found these two employees missing from duty since June 1. An enquiry into the missing staff revealed that Chauhan had died a couple of years ago and Ambekar had retired from service. Sources questioned the NMC’s lackadaisical approach in addressing issues involving lives of Nagpurians. What’s more, sources claimed that rarely did anyone of the 220-odd people deputed on the cell were on the field during emergency situations like heavy rain like the one that lashed the city on July 8. Barring sanitary workers and NMC’s fire department personnel, none of the cell’s staff can be found on duty at the time of emergency calls. Citing examples, sources said even calls about tree uprooting were attended to by firemen, who also attended the task of dewatering in low-lying areas. Executive engineers, who were given the charge of zone-wise disaster cell, too were not reachable after office hours, said sources. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi was not available for comments. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari assured inquiry into the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/deceased-retired-staff-on-nmc-disaster-management-cell-list/articleshow/84391573.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The state cabinet, which met at Pragati Bhavan on Tuesday, directed the officials to prepare the calendar every year after identifying vacant posts in each department. The cabinet will meet again on Wednesday to finalise the recruitment drive to be taken up in the state. All the departments secretaries have been asked to brief the cabinet with details. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has recently announced that the government would fill up 50,000 vacancies in various government departments. On the request of government employees’ unions, the cabinet also discussed about allocation of posts at the district level and recruitment process. The cabinet meeting, chaired by the CM, decided to reserve 50% of seats in various government residential schools for students belonging to respective assembly constituencies. KCR directed the local MLA, mandal praja parishad president, ZP chairperson and municipal chairperson to attend the monthly meetings of residential welfare schools in their respective jurisdictions. During its seven-and-a-half hour meeting, the cabinet also discussed about surge in Covid-19 cases in some districts, preparedness for third wave of the pandemic, Pattana Pragati and Palle Pragati programmes, development of municipalities and enhancement of land values for property registrations. Last week, the CM had directed the health secretary to visit border districts where Covid-19 cases were on the rise and sought a report. The health secretary submitted the report to the CM. The cabinet enquired about availability of medicines, oxygen, infrastructure facilities in the hospitals, vaccination and preparedness on the part of officials on a possible third wave. The CM directed the officials to keep medicines and beds ready apart from completing fever survey in the state. Both panchayat raj and municipal administration departments have submitted reports on Palle and Pattana Pragati programmes that concluded a couple of days ago. KCR directed the officials to complete graveyards in all municipalities and villages within one month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cabinet-okays-annual-job-calendar/articleshow/84391588.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand plans to vaccinate 100% of its adult population by year end||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand aims to vaccinate 100% of its adult population (a total of 77,29,468 beneficiaries) by the end of this year – December 31. Till date, 13% of the state’s eligible population has been fully vaccinated and 51% have been partially vaccinated. On Monday, newly appointed state health minister Dhan Singh Rawat had met union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya and sought 20 lakh Covid-19 vaccines per month to meet his goal. A total of 7,200 ‘gram swasthya samitis’ have been formed to meet the target. These teams will be headed by Chief Medical Officer and consist of Asha workers and ANMs, among other frontline health workers. They will be included in the vaccination drives at their designated areas and maintain databases. They will also alert the CMOs if a local health facility is not meeting basic needs of villagers of that area. These committees will meet every fortnight to share updates from villages. “Our target is to make Bageshwar and Rudryaprayag the first two fully vaccinated districts of the country, not just Uttarakhand. Our gram swasthya samitis are now active and will help us create a robust health infrastructure in the remote hills too,” Rawat said on Tuesday. TOI sources in the health department said that around 23% adult beneficiaries in Bageshwar district and 17% in Rudraprayag have been fully vaccinated. They added that meeting the target will be particularly difficult in Udham Singh Nagar and Haridwar as there is a lot of vaccine hesitancy in these districts. The health department has decided to conduct a one-day seminar and training session for people’s representatives regarding Covid-19 and ways to tackle the third wave. For the third wave, as per directions of the health minister, kits with medicines and multivitamins are being readied for children, as they are most at risk this time. Also, 600 health camps will be organised across the state in the next four months. At the meeting with Mandaviya, Rawat got permission for Rs 200 crore funds from the centre for various National Health Mission (NHM) projects. The focus is now on completing the NHM projects quickly, including filling all 1,865 vacant posts of Asha and Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-plans-to-vaccinate-100-of-its-adult-population-by-year-end/articleshow/84386876.cms||Shivani Azad

The fourth-year MBBS student is currently asymptomatic. She came to know about her reinfection only because of a mandatory RT-PCR test before proceeding to Delhi to collect some personal documents that she had earlier submitted to the government. “My daughter is not under medication now as she has no manifest ailments. She has been quarantined on the first floor of our house,” said the girl’s father, who has tested negative. The girl, who had first tested positive on returning from Wuhan in the last week of January 2020, hasn’t been vaccinated yet. Her father said she chose not to get the jab because she wanted to go back to China and wasn’t sure whether any of the vaccines available in India would be accepted there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-first-covid-patient-tests-positive-again/articleshow/84395145.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Absence of TTE in bogie is deficiency, consumer court slaps Rs 30,000 fine||NAGPUR: While commuting in a train, sometimes you may find the Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) missing from the bogie. The Gondia District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum has slapped Rs 30,000 fine on railways, terming such absence of TTE in coaches as “deficiency in service”. A bench comprising president Bhaskar Yogi and member Sarita Raipure directed divisional railway managers (DRMs) of Central Railway’s Pune and Bhusawal divisions to recover the amount from the erring officers’ salaries for dereliction of duty and loss caused to the public authority. They, however, were told to conduct an internal inquiry before acting against officials. The case was filed by advocate Sudhir Rathod of Gondia, who submitted documents received by him under the RTI Act. The rules mentioned that there must be one TTE for every three sleeper coaches, as per the Railway Board guidelines. The 64-year-old applicant and his wife had booked tickets from Pune to Nagpur in Azad Hind Express on October 30, 2017, in sleeper class. As there was no TTE, many unauthorized passengers encroached in their S-1 coach and even entered into arguments with the senior citizens. The veteran couple faced difficulty while utilizing toilets due to obstruction caused by the illegal passengers, who occupied the floors, as the train was fully packed. Rathod lodged a complaint with the forum against the DRM stating that they faced mental and physical harassment due to unauthorized passengers in the absence of TTE, which is a “shortcoming” and “deficiency in service” by the railways despite charging full ticket amount. His contentions were challenged by the railway authorities while denying charges levelled by him. They, however, admitted that S-1 bogie was unmanned, as TTE was absent on that day, for the entire journey from Pune to Nagpur. Quoting the citizens charter on passenger service from railways, the judges mentioned that basic facilities like booking arrangements, waiting hall, benches, lighting, drinking water, platform, urinals should be made available at all stations. Moreover, in trains, lighting and fans, cushioned beds, toilets, reservation charts and destination board should be provided along with TTE or conductor for attending to complaints or grievances. In his arguments, based on RTI reply, the veteran lawyer pointed out duties of TTE in sleeper class, which mention checking travelling authority of passengers inside the coach and guiding them to berths/seats. They will prevent unauthorized persons from travelling and pay prompt attention to all passenger complaints. It included non-functioning of lights and taking remedial measures to get them rectified. The TTE is also supposed to take care of passengers’ amenities and cleanliness of the bogies. “We’ve no hesitation to conclude that the lawyer’s complaint’s is true and genuine. Without any rebuttal of his claims by the opponents, his contentions seem to be truthful and is supported by a written complaint at the Gondia Railway Station. There’s no reply or investigation done by the railway authorities regarding dereliction of duties towards the general public,” the judges ruled while allowing Rathod’s complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/absence-of-tte-in-bogie-is-deficiency-consumer-court-slaps-rs30k-fine/articleshow/84391607.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) will lay 2,000 km pipelines and construct nearly 100 small reservoirs for supplying drinking water to these colonies. Official sources said the HMWS&SB had already completed works on the drinking water network at a cost of Rs 700 crore in phase I. But, this network was confined to only village settlements outside the GHMC limits. “Every year, hundreds of new colonies are coming up as the Hyderabad metropolitan area development is expanding. If the new regional ring road (RRR) is developed, the city will further expand outside the present ORR also. Since water is a necessity, the government is focusing on providing drinking water network,” a senior official of municipal administration department said. In phase II, seven municipal corporations such as Peerzadiguda, Jawaharnagar, Boduppal, Badangpet and Nizampet, 12 municipalities like Ghatkesar and 17 gram panchayats would be covered. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao directed the municipal authorities that there should not be water scarcity in the HMDA areas and every household should get 130 ML per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rs-1200cr-for-water-supply-to-new-colonies/articleshow/84391601.cms||Koride Mahesh

Waterlogging in potholes near Doon University in Mothrowala area has affected the lives of residents. Ashok Pradhan, a resident, said, “The roads could not be seen after it rained for a couple of hours in the city. Some people had to use their cars to move out as walking was not possible. The lack of preparedness by authorities is clearly making the monsoon unpleasant for us.” Similarly, the plight of residents in Ambiwala in Sahaspur was also unbearable as the roads have submerged, forcing people to stay indoors. The residents alleged that Ambiwala-Shuklapur road has not witnessed renovation since past eight years. The rain has turned the roads, which are in a dilapidated state, into a nightmare as they are full of muck. Cracks have developed on the newly constructed roads too. A similar crack can be seen in front of Gandhi park. Residents alleged that the control room at Dehradun Municipal corporation didn’t respond to their calls. On Tuesday, municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey along with district magistrate Ashish Srivastava and MDDA VC Ranvir Singh Chauhan reached Mothrowala area.

The four persons are missing and were included in the list of dead people. But the government has not yet issued a civil death order and the compensation is pending. Despite several appeals, the relatives have not received the death certificates from the concerned authorities. The major landslide at Pettimudy under Kannan Devan Hills Plantation (KDHP) in Munnar on last August 6 claimed the lives of 70 members of worker families living in three estate layams (cluster of workers’ quarters). A month-long rescue operation could not trace the bodies of Dineshkumar, 22, Kasthuri, 26, Priyadarshini, 7, and Karthika, 21. Shanmughanathan, a resident of Munnar, lost his two sons Dineshkumar and Nithishkumar, 19, in the landslide. The body of Dineshkumar is still missing. Shanmughanathan told TOI, “We filed several appeals to the revenue department to issue the death certificate of the missing people. But the officials say that they need a government order to issue it. Without the death certificate we didn’t get compensation and other insurance benefits for the missing people.” “Over 17 relatives of the landslide victims have not received compensation from the state government. They said that it is due to the lack of funds. Only four people received the financial assistance announced by the Tamil Nadu government. None of the relatives of the landslide victims received compensation from the central government,” he said. Devikulam tahsildar R Radhakrishnan told TOI that the government should issue a ‘civil death’ order for us to issue death certificates to the missing people. “We have submitted all documents to the government and are awaiting the government order to issue death certificates. To complete the compensation distribution we need to get funds from the government. In some cases, there are disputes over compensation money sharing,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-death-certificates-yet-for-the-missing/articleshow/84389343.cms||Sandeep Thomas

The existence of a dumping yard along the bridge and to-and-fro movement of wastage vehicles makes matters worse during rains. Salar Jung Bridge is mostly used by scores of residents who come to see the Salar Jung Museum, Charminar, Mecca Masjid and Chowmahalla Palace, but to their surprise, the condition of the road, piles of garbage and the slippery way causes inconvenience for them. Locals complained that the matter has been taken up with officials concerned several times but nothing has been done to remove the dumping yards and mend the passage. Mohammed Ahmed, TDP, GHMC minority cell vice-president told TOI that multiple complaints had been made regarding slippery conditions of the Salar Jung Bridge in rain but no initiative has been taken to protect people from the dangerous passagecausing injuries to motorists. “Many people have suffered due to the accidents on this road. Motorists lose balance or vehicles skate, causing injuries. The authorities should take immediate note of the problem or else we will make a police complaint against GHMC negligence,” he added. The motorists want officials to put up sign boards about the slippery passage to thwart any untoward incidents. “The road has been dangerous enough to lead to accidents.

---||Mumbai||Uran land deal: ED records accountant’s statement||Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate or ED recently recorded the statement of an accountant, Kishor Dewani, with whom former state home minister Anil Deshmukh’s son Salil owned land in Uran worth Rs 300 crore. The land was purchased from local villagers in 2006, mostly by paying in cash. While examining the land deal details, the ED learnt that the Deshmukh family had a dummy company through which they were controlling Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd, on whose name the Uran land parcels were purchased. The Deshmukh family had no shareholding in Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd at that point of time, although Salil was one of the directors in the company. Kishor Dewani was managing the company on behalf of the Deshmukh family, ED sources said. The ED recorded the statement of people connected with the deal and during the investigation, they came to know that in 2006, Flourish Properties Pvt Ltd, a company controlled by Deshumukh’s son Hrishikesh, gave a Rs 1.41 crore loan to Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd for purchasing the plots in Uran. It is alleged that huge cash was also transferred to Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd for the land purchase. When TOI tried to contact Deshmukh for his version, his cell phone was switched off. He did not respond to text messages. On Tuesday, TOI had reported that the ED was probing 15 plots collectively admeasuring 8.3 acres in Dhutum village, Uran taluka, purchased through deals by Salil. The land is located a stone’s throw away from NH 348 (Palaspe Phata to JNPT). One of the land parcels was purchased from a freedom fighter’s family. Different plots adjoining each other were purchased, and they now form a large single plot without any boundary. It is alleged that after purchasing the land in the span of a few years, Salil Deshmukh bought 50% shares of Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd by investing Rs 18 lakh (Rs 5 lakh in 2010 and Rs 13 lakh in 2017). Both investments were made by cheques. Then Salil transferred half of his shares in the name of his brother Hrishikesh Deshmukh as a gift. The ED is examining the entire land deal transaction in the money laundering case it is investigating against Anil Deshmukh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/uran-land-deal-ed-records-accountants-statement/articleshow/84391683.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Chennai||Future of minor ports poses major concern for states||CHENNAI: For years the Union government was content with controlling the major ports across the country. It allowed states to notify and control the minor ports, despite the subject being part of the concurrent list that allows the Centre to have a say. That situation could change now, with the Centre moving ahead with the Indian Ports Bill, 2021. Through this proposed law, the Union government wants to have complete control over all sea ports, including the authority to decide who can operate and manage them. The development has rattled the states, especially most of the coastal states from Gujarat on the western coast to West Bengal on the eastern side. They fear this as yet another attempt by the Centre to usurp power of the states to create imbalance in the federal set-up. The nine coastal states include those ruled by the BJP such as Gujarat, Goa and Karnataka. Tamil Nadu was the first to raise the red flag, while Odisha soon followed by raising objections to certain provisions or non-provisions in the new bill. On June 22, chief minister M K Stalin reached out to CMs of nine coastal states, urging them to express their objection to the new draft Indian Ports Bill, 2021, and take joint action to prevent any move to dilute the powers vested with the states as per the Indian Ports Act, 1908. Till now state governments had the power to plan, develop, regulate and control minor ports, the new bill proposes to transfer many of these powers to the Maritime State Development Council (MSDC), which has so far been an advisory body. K Ashok Vardhan Shetty, a former IAS officer and former vice-chancellor of the Indian Maritime University, Chennai, says the draft Indian Ports Bill 2021 contains some good parts such as provisions for safety and security of Indian ports and prevention and containment of pollution at ports, which ensure compliance with India’s obligations under various maritime treaties and international instruments. "But Chapters II and III dealing with the MSDC are controversial," he said. Set up in 1997 with the Union minister for shipping as chairman and the ministers in charge of ports of the maritime states as members, the MSDC functions as an apex advisory body for the coordinated development of major and non-major ports. It makes suitable recommendations to the concerned ministries about infrastructure such as roads, rail and inland waterway transport. While it is understandable to grant statutory status to the MSDC, its composition as per the draft bill is overtly weighted in favour of the Centre. Either the MSDC should have only the Union minister for shipping and other ministers from maritime states as members with civil servants as special invitees, or the secretaries in charge of ports in the maritime states along with the nine joint secretaries of the Union government — in the interests of fairness and balance, he said. According to Shetty, if the performance of non-major ports, over the years, had been unsatisfactory, then the present move could be justified. "The major ports’ share of cargo moved has come down from 92% in 1993-94 to 54% in 2020-21, whereas the non-major ports’ share has gone up from 8% to 46% over the same period. Non-major ports are well set to overtake major ports in a couple of years," he said. Further, the operating efficiency of many smaller ports is better than that of major ports. States like Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu achieved this by granting concessions to the private sector to operate the non-major ports. The Union government too is now towing this line by shifting the major ports from the old service ports model to the landlord ports model, wherein terminals are being operated by private parties, besides outsourcing port functions. The present combined capacity of all the major ports put together is about 1,500 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), whereas the total cargo moved is only about 700 MMTPA, reflecting a capacity utilisation of a mere 47%. Moreover, the Union ministry of shipping is strapped for cash and its annual budget is less than `2,000 crore. "The move to bring the non-major ports under what appears to be the administrative control of MSDC is unjustified. Apart from stifling the initiatives of the maritime states, it is likely to create more bureaucratic hurdles in capacity addition and functioning. It is also likely to curtail competition to the benefit of the existing players," Shetty said. That is why the industry is also rattled, given the monopolistic rise of one conglomerate. While a majority of projects are awarded to a qualified bidder offering the highest revenue share to the government through a transparent process, the assets are transferred back at the end of the concession period, making them truly national/state assets. But the reality is different. "It is common for original concessionaire to share certain equity stake with private/public entities for capacity augmentation of ports. But recent transactions involving large conglomerates, taking control of port assets by making the concessionaires cede control without any need for price discovery is raising concerns," said an industry source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/future-of-minor-ports-poses-major-concern-for-states/articleshow/84389366.cms||D Govardan

The video of the incident went viral on Tuesday. The youth — identified as Shiva — was admitted to the district hospital, where he succumbed to his bullet injuries on Monday, said police. In the purported video, a youth standing on the terrace could be seen recording video of the fight, said police. The youth was allegedly shot at and his mobile phone fell down. As he screamed for help, his voice could be heard in the video, said police. Seconds later, after grabbing his mobile phone, he stated that he was shot at and showed his bullet wound, said police. Sambhal superintendent of police Chakresh Mishra said, “A video surfaced on social media two days after the brawl and the firing. Both groups are political rivals. We have taken cognisance of the purported video clip and have included it in our investigation. Further legal action is underway. Three accused have already been arrested in this connection and sent to jail.” Two days ago, a passer-by, identified as Navratna (50), was allegedly killed and two others injured after a group had "opened indiscriminate fire" at another following a dispute in Sisauna village of Sambhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/youth-recording-video-of-brawl-between-rival-groups-shot-dead-video-goes-viral/articleshow/84387032.cms||Maria Khan
---||Mumbai||Non-cooperation delayed trial, says court; no bail for Haroon in Mumbai||Mumbai: In an order rejecting the bail plea of 40-year-old accused, Haroon Naik, almost 10 years after he was arrested in the 2011 Mumbai triple bomb blasts case, a special MCOCA court cited various grounds, including non-cooperation from the accused in framing charges expeditiously and Covid-19-related restrictions, for the delayed trial. The court said from time to time, the accused filed various interim applications requiring it to decide them on priority. “It has also hurdled the progress of trial,” the court said. The court also pointed out Naik was allegedly involved in an organized crime, causing 27 deaths, for which the probable sentence would be death or life imprisonment. Responding to orders cited by the defence, the court relied on an apex court ruling and categorized Naik as an undertrial falling within group ‘A’ who cannot receive liberal treatment. “As evident from the record of the case as well as from the earlier order of rejecting bail, the applicant was indulged in the serious organized crime. Already his such prima facie involvement has been upheld not only by this court but by...high court also,” the court said. In his bail plea, Naik cited the long-pending trial and his almost decade-long incarceration. The prosecution, though, opposed the bail plea and submitted that Naik was one of the main culprits. Accepting the prosecution’s submissions, the court said earlier, too, there was sufficient prima facie material found against Naik for being a member of an organized crime syndicate headed by co-accused Yasin Bhatkal. It was alleged on Bhatkal’s instructions, Naik allegedly provided Rs 10 lakh via hawala transactions which was used to fund multiple blasts.  The court said some of the accused had not cooperated in framing of charges expeditiously on various grounds. Trial can start only after charges are framed. It said, “Materially, they insist on keeping them physically present before the court. However, mainly those accused are prohibited...to be removed from prison. Therefore I have repeatedly tried to read over the charge by convening them through VC (video-conferencing)... But some of those accused refused even to hear the charge and left the VC room of prison.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/non-cooperation-delayed-trial-says-court-no-bail-for-haroon-in-mumbai/articleshow/84393816.cms||Rebecca Samervel

A portion of the hill collapsed and boulders came rolling down, blocking a service road and leaving residents of houses on the opposite side worried. Later, Canacona mamlatdar Vimod Dalal and surveyor Narendra Agrasani visited the spot. Dalal directed the traffic police to put barricades and close the road for vehicular traffic pending clearance of the debris. Keeping in mind the safety of residents and commuters, Dalal further said the road will continue to remain closed till the departments concerned are able to ensure that the area is safe for use. Due to this, commuters who would use this road for their onward journey to Loliem, Peddem and Shelli, will now have to take a roundabout via the Mashem bazaar. Pancha Bhushan Prabhugaonkar said that during his tenure as sarpanch, he had forwarded letters to the PWD highlighting the dangerous spot, but that no remedial action was taken. Further, he expressed confidence that MLA Isidore would take necessary action to find a solution ensuring that the remaining portion of the hill doesn’t pose a danger in future to residents, commuters and pedestrians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/landslide-puts-loliem-polem-villagers-on-edge/articleshow/84391837.cms||---

There had been moves by the Kitex to move out to other states during the stint of the Oommen Chandy government as well. Then, the issues were settled through talks, Babu said. The Congress MLAs who gave complaints against Kitex didn’t ask the government to close down the factory. They only asked that the company should function by following the rules. The chief minister is remaining a mute spectator without interfering on the Kitex issue. This gives a message that Kerala is an investor unfriendly state, he said. The Kitex managing director who now speaks like the brand ambassador of Telangana should remember that it was in Kerala that his business flourished, Babu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cm-should-shed-stubborn-stand-on-kitex-issue-babu/articleshow/84389425.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi HC directs activist to remove offensive tweets against ex-diplomat||NEW DELHI: In the age of social media, desecration of the reputation of a public figure has become child’s play, Delhi High Court observed on Tuesday, while ordering a self-styled activist to remove offensive tweets from his handle. The court warned that due diligence or at least a “preliminary inquiry into facts” was necessary before anyone posts “messages on a social media platform, made accessible to all members of the public, against any person.” Justice C Hari Shankar’s observations came while directing Saket Gokhale to immediately delete alleged defamatory tweets against former diplomat Lakshmi Murdeshwar Puri. The court also restrained him from posting any more “scandalous” tweets against her and her husband, Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri. Referring to the ease with which anyone could be vilified online, the court noted, “All that is needed is the opening of a social media account and, thereafter, posting of messages. Thousands of responses are received and, in the process, the reputation of the man, who is targeted, becomes mud.” It underlined that the “reputations, nourished and nurtured over years of selfless service and toil, may crumble in an instant; one thoughtless barb is sufficient.” The court also rejected Gokhale’s claim that a person had no responsibility to reach out to the subject or verify facts before posting it on social media. “Such a submission, if accepted, would place the reputation of every citizen in serious jeopardy, and open to ransom at the hands of every social media vigilante, some of whose intentions may be less than honourable. This is even more so in the case of public figures, whose actions are, as a matter of course, subjected to intensive and invasive dissection by all members of the public,” the court said. It said, if Gokhale failed to delete the tweets within 24 hours, Twitter should take them down. It was hearing a defamation suit filed by Puri, a former assistant secretary-general at the United Nations, against whom Gokhale had tweeted on June 13 and 26 and referred to certain property purchased by her in Switzerland. In her suit Lakshmi Puri had sought Rs 5 crore in damages from Gokhale and an immediate removal of the tweets, contending that these were false and factually incorrect, per se defamatory and slanderous against her and her family. The high court lso issued summons to Gokhale on the main suit and directed him to file his written statement within four weeks and listed the case before the joint registrar on September 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/high-court-directs-activist-to-remove-offensive-tweets-against-ex-diplomat/articleshow/84391741.cms||Abhinav Garg

It had been asked explain its stance on the issue raised by one Bhikha Jajadia in the PIL, that a garbage dump had been created within the city. The HC said it was passing an interim order “considering the obstinate attitude and stance of the corporation”. The court further said, “The absence of the Bhavnagar Municipal Corporation has been taken notice of by this court very seriously. Prima facie, the corporation is in contempt.”The petitioner, through advocate Sandip Mujyasara, raised the issue and sought quashing of a resolution by the corporation to make a solid waste management project, a refuse transfer station to dump the garbage of the entire city at one location, for further processing and treatment. The site selected for this project is Chavdi Gate, which is in the middle of the city. On HC directions, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) submitted an inspection report showing how the refuse transfer station is in the middle of the city and the nearest housing colony is just 15 metres away. However, the GPCB opined that since the main landfill site is 7-8km from the city, commissioning of the refuse transfer station would result in a considerable reduction of fuel consumption, traffic congestion and and working hours needed for dumping of solid waste.The HC has posted a further hearing on this issue for July 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/civic-body-stayed-from-dumping-waste-at-refuse-station/articleshow/84389418.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Fuel on fire: Diesel all set to score a century in Bhopal||BHOPAL: After breaching Rs 100 a litre mark in Anuppur 15 days ago, diesel is now inching towards the century mark in Bhopal and many other cities of Madhya Pradesh. In the state capital, it was retailed at Rs 98.56 per litre on Tuesday. As diesel prices shoot up, they have a cascading effect on other commodities too, leading to inflation. In the last two years, the cost of diesel has skyrocketed from Rs 69.57 a litre to Rs 98.56, this increase of almost Rs 30 per litre is burning a hole in the pockets of transporters, bus operators and common man. The prices have been surging almost on a daily basis since June 15, 2017 when the dynamic pricing was introduced. On Tuesday, petrol was retailed at Rs 109.53 per litre in Bhopal, while people still wait for some relief in vain. Now that there is hardly any difference between diesel and petrol prices, the urban buyers feel ‘cheated’ having purchased diesel cars and SUVs to cut fuel costs. On the other hand, farmers, transporters and bus operators feel “harassed” in the face of this ‘unbearable burden.’ Rahul Raj, vice president of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasangh, said: “ The cost of cultivation is growing every day. When we harvested the summer moong, diesel rates were touching a new high. When the farmers were sowing soybean, corn and paddy, there were new high rates of diesel and when we again harvest these crops, the rates will be even higher. We also need diesel for running pumps for irrigation.” The state government has its reasons for not paying heed to demand for reducing the taxes slapped on diesel and petrol. The state collects Rs 27.75 on every litre of petrol sold as taxes and this includes a cess of Rs 4.50, while it collects about Rs 18.75 per litre in tax on diesel, including Rs 3 as cess. The quantum of revenue generated through uel can be understood from the fact that after a hike of just Re 1 on the fuel as cess to compensate for the revenue loss during corona crisis in 2020- the government had aimed to collect an estimated Rs 570 crore annually -Rs 200 crore from petrol and Rs 370 crore from diesel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/fuel-on-fire-diesel-all-set-to-score-a-century-in-bhopal/articleshow/84389416.cms||Deshdeep Saxena

However, in retaliatory firing, the criminal was shot in the leg and arrested again. The accused, Sumit Bagga (27), is a resident of Balbir Vihar and a history-sheeter from Aman Vihar. He is involved in 53 cases of snatching, robbery, thefts and under Arms Act. According to police, around 9.20pm on Tuesday, Bagga was arrested from near Central Park in Sector 20 Rohini following a tip-off from an informer. A loaded pistol, a stolen gold chain and a motorcycle were seized from him. During interrogation, Bagga said the illegal country-made pistol being used by him was provided by his associate and relative, Rohit, who was also involved in snatching the gold chain. “A police team then made preparations to raid Rohit’s residence in Rajiv Nagar Extension near Begumpur. When the team arrived near Sector 37, Bagga, who was also brought along for confirmation, requested to be allowed to relieve himself. However, as soon as he got out of the police vehicle, he snatched the pistol from a cop and opened fire to escape,” said a senior police officer. A bullet hit head constable Jaswinder in his thigh, but he shot back at Bagga and injured him in his leg. The other cops then overpowered Bagga. He has now been booked for attempt to murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/snatcher-grabs-cops-pistol-opens-fire-in-bid-to-flee/articleshow/84424392.cms||---

Nitin Patel, deputy chief minister and government spokesman, on Tuesday said, “The Gujarat government will first study the new laws introduced by other states on population control before taking a final decision on the matter.” Patel’s statement has come at a time when the BJPruled Uttar Pradesh government has introduced a draft of its population control bill, which states that people with more than two children will be barred from contesting local body elections, applying for government jobs or receiving any kind of subsidy. Speaking to mediapersons in Gandhinagar, the deputy chief minister said, “Different states are bringing in new laws for population control. The Gujarat government will first study these laws and take an appropriate decision if it is required.” The BJP leader further said that the state government has already implemented a law that bars people with more than two children from contesting elections for local bodies, such as taluka panchayats, district panchayats, municipalities and municipal corporations. “In Gujarat, people with more than two children cannot contest local body polls. This shows that we have implemented this idea (of population control) many years ago. Moreover, we also run awareness campaigns to convince people to opt for family planning,” Patel said. The Gujarat government had introduced a law in 2005, setting a two-child limit for contesting local elections while Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the Gujarat chief minister. Since then, many candidates have been barred from contesting elections for having more than two children. ‘BJP wants to divert attention from core issues’:The Congress alleged that the BJP is looking to divert peoples’ attention from the core issues of rising prices, farmers’ problems and others. “BJP is floating ideas like a population control bill only to divert people’s attention from the core issues like sky-rocketing prices, failure to address the issues of farmers, youth and women and the like,” Congress spokesman Manish Doshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/will-study-laws-of-other-states-patel/articleshow/84389391.cms||---

After a meeting with CM BS Yediyurappa and his cabinet colleagues here to review the progress of Jal Jeevan Mission that seeks to provide piped water supply to all households, Shekhawat said he would soon convene a meeting in Delhi to discuss issues relating to Karnataka’s irrigation projects. “After studying the issues, the Centre will take a suitable decision and render justice to Karnataka,” he said. His assurance holds significance as it came a day after Tamil Nadu passed a resolution opposing implementation of the Mekedatu project, which has been planned to address drinking water needs of Bengaluru and ensure effective management of water during distress years. We requested Centre to clear Kalasa-Banduri project: CMAbout the Tamil Nadu government’s resolution, Shekhawat said: “Let them (TN) take any decision. The Centre will do its duty as per the law. We will take a call on the Mekedatu project after hearing from both states. And the Supreme Court has to give its judgment.” Yediyurappa said the Union minister assured Karnataka that pending clearances for state’s irrigation projects will soon come through. “We urged the minister to publish the final verdict of Krishna river water tribunal in the gazette and provide clearance to Kalasa-Banduri project. The minister responded to our requests positively,” the chief minister said. “I don’t want to discuss Tamil Nadu or any other state (regarding water-sharing disputes). We have every right (to plan the project) and we are going to start work on it,” Yediyurappa said with reference to Tamil Nadu’s objection to the Mekedatu project. Yediyurappa said 25 lakh tap connections will be provided this year under Jal Jeevan Mission. “The recent four-fold increase in the Centre’s grants will help the state achieve the target in time,” he added.

Just then, a Muslim business house in Ullal known to the bride’s family stepped forward and offered them financial and logistical support to conduct the wedding. The MK family, headed by MK Razak, made all the arrangements — from buying bridal jewellery to hosting mehndi event — to ensure smooth conduct of the wedding of Kavana with Ranjith at Sri Durgaparameshwari Temple in Talapady as per Hindu customs. Kavana’s mother Geetha, whose husband died due to chickenpox five years ago, sold her small house and property in Shaktinagar four months ago due to the financial crisis. Later, Geetha, who does domestic work for a living, and her daughter shifted to a rented house in Manchila, near Ullal. Ranjith, 25, from Kanhangad in Kasargod district of Kerala, is a civil contractor. Muslim family helped them financiallyKavana studied up to SSLC and couldn’t pursue higher studies due to financial crisis. Kavana’s elder sister Kavya was married two years ago. MK Almaz, a member of the MK family, told TOI Kavana’s uncle Suresh narrated the plight of Geetha’s family a couple of weeks before the wedding. “Immediately, Razak visited Geetha’s house and provided groceries, an LPG stove with cylinder and other necessary items. Later, Razak held discussions with all MK family members, including MK Group’s UH Abdul Rehman and MK Hamza. Following this, arrangements were made through MK Group Marriage Fund to buy gold ornaments, including anklets, ring and earrings, and silver articles,” Almaz said. Geetha thanked the MK family and said she would “pray for their welfare for all times to come.” It is for the first time that the MK Group Marriage Fund – set up exclusively for the benefit of extended family members in distress – was extended for a marriage outside the family. “My father MK Hamza organised a mehndi ceremony on the eve of Kavana’s wedding. The marriage was held as per Hindu rituals at the temple in the presence of MK family members Riyaz, Mubarish, Razak, Haneef and Abdul Rehman,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/muslim-family-sponsors-hindu-girls-marriage/articleshow/84395313.cms||Vinobha K T

Worshipped by locals, the structures are treasure troves showcasing aspects of Tamil culture and heritage dating back to the Nayak period. It is said that Usilampatti got its name from the Usilai forests that were common in the area. At the site, four pillars mark the two hero stones. Members of a Yaadhum Oore Yaavarum Kelir, an organisation of history enthusiasts, accompanied by rock art expert and historian K T Gandhirajan had ventured into this forest of Usilai trees, which locals consider sacred.A member of the organisation V Parthiban, says the forest has remained unchanged here. "Locals do not collect firewood or even break a twig from these trees or pick flowers or leaves. It is considered a crime to do so and hence these trees flourish here," he said.Memorial stones are common in the state, most have two or three panels with information in writing or drawings about the person for whom the stone was erected, but this one is unique, says Gandhirajan. "The stones had nine layers of panels on them on all four sides, and they depictstories in the small space with accuracy. Hero stones with many layers or panels are usually found in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, and it is possible that these stones were erected by people who migrated here from those regions."From the drawings and stone structure, the expert said, the stones belong to the Nayak period, about 400 years ago. The bigger of the two stones is 10ft in height and one foot in width. There are nine panels on the unbroken stones, and the second one also would have had the same number of panels. On the last panel, there are drawings of a Shiva linga and Nandhi, which may refer to heaven and immortality.One of the stories depicted is of goddess Petchiamman, the deity worshipped by the Pappampatti Nattar community, in Karumathur in the region. She is seen holding an infant.There is another of a man with a bow and arrow, and one of a man taming a bull and then getting married. A man on horseback is another diagram on these stones.A similar stone of a man on horseback seen in Kongarpuliankulam in the neighbourhood is worshipped by the locals. These stones are referred to as Veerakambam and many such stones are found in the Cumbum region in Theni district, said Gandhirajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/usilai-forest-home-to-nayak-era-memorial/articleshow/84389434.cms||---

The gold seized is valued at approximately Rs 69 lakh and further investigation is underway and the passenger has been arrested as the gold is over the allowed limit. “Customs officers at Jaipur International Airport intercepted one passenger, who arrived from Dubai by Air India flight on Monday evening and after thorough examination of his baggage, 1399.600 gram of gold valued at Rs 68,93,030 has been seized. The said gold was concealed in mixer grinder machine. Further investigation is going on,” said an official. The passenger was arrested and has been sent to judicial custody. He is from Rajasthan and it appears that he did odd jobs in Dubai. This recent seizure is by far one of the largest with the highest value in the past few months. In other cases, the passengers were not arrested as the gold was within the allowed limit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/1-4kg-gold-valued-at-rs-69l-seized-at-city-airport-1-arrested/articleshow/84391728.cms||---

According to the parents, they found their child missing when they woke up at the midnight. They searched for their child everywhere, but to no avail, said the parents. Police said that they had registered a case and were scanning CCTV footage to trace the accused. A daily wage labourer, Pappu of Makrandpur village under Bilari police station, was sleeping at the railway station road with his family, including a daughter and son, when the baby went missing. The family informed the UP Police Dial 112 emergency service about the incident, following which a SOG team visited the spot. Superintendent of police (city) Amit Kumar Anand said, “A case was registered against unidentified persons. Our teams are trying to gather CCTV footage from cameras installed outside hotels on the railway station road and adjacent areas. Roadside eateries, shops and residents are also being searched for CCTV footages to identify the culprits.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/six-month-old-baby-sleeping-with-parents-on-roadside-kidnapped-in-moradabad/articleshow/84387070.cms||Maria Khan
---||Pune||Pune: Professors, students want colleges to reopen soon||PUNE: Principals and educationists in the district have said that colleges could be reopened for only the practical batches of final-year students of junior college, graduate and post-graduate courses. Principals have said that in the first phase, preference must be given to practical batches only, as they are generally a group of 15-20 students, and a six-ft distance can be kept between two persons in college. Meanwhile, the Savitribai Phule Pune University is chalking out a plan to vaccinate all its students. “Reopening of colleges will be much easier if there is a way to vaccinate all students, even if it is only the first dose. Hence, we spoke to the Pune Municipal Corporation commissioner as well as the Pune city mayor regarding the possibility of vaccinating the final-year students and then other students on priority basis. Their response has been positive. This will be first done for students from Pune district and then extended to others. Since the university campus has a smaller student strength, we will try to vaccinate all students on the campus and then will also try the same for affiliated colleges having a bigger student strength. Even if each student gets one vaccine dose in the next one month, there will be a better chance of reopening colleges adhering to all safety norms and even parents will feel at ease sending their wards to college,” said Nitin Karmalkar, vice-chancellor, SPPU. Principals fear that it would be difficult for students to find jobs without any practical knowledge at under-graduate and post-graduate levels. “In the first phase, all final-year students, at least in science stream, must be allowed to attend practicals. These students did not do most practicals even during last year, hence practicals of both years can be conducted for them. In the second phase, post-graduate students can probably be called as each class has only 20-24 students, making it easier to adhere to social distancing and other safety protocols,” said Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal, Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar. Ajay Darekar, associate professor, M S Kakade College, Baramati, said that there has been a tremendous learning loss due to online education. “There are villages in the district which celebrate when there is electricity. How can we expect students from these places to have access to smartphones and online lectures? It is imperative that offline lectures be started at least for finalyear students. Second, when the government has reopened all tourist spots and restaurants why colleges have not been reopened? Lastly, though we are conducting online lectures, we are hardly doing anything to justify salaries. Hence, we want the colleges to reopen and teach so that we can look at students and understand if they have actually understood a topic or not,” said Darekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/professors-students-want-colleges-to-reopen-soon/articleshow/84391726.cms||Ardhra Nair

The work had started full throttle, with tribal artistes putting together each aspect of their lifestyle with a lot of passion and attention to detail, but the work on this front has slowed down due to pandemic. Before the second wave of pandemic hit the state, there were 27 tribal artistes working every day at these huts, but we sent them home as soon as the last lockdown was announced, informed the curator of tribal museum, Ashok Mishra. “Those were tough times and we didn’t want any of our artistes to suffer due to pandemic. Post unlock, seven of them have returned, but there are several others who are still battling the fear factor of lurking pandemic. Also, some of the artistes are waiting for heavy downpour to complete the process of sowing paddy, groundnut at home. All this has affected the speed of the project, although more than 50 per cent work is already complete. We don’t want to push the tribal artistes, but they have assured us that they would return soon.” Along with tribal culture, city foodies are looking forward to enjoying some of the exotic ancient recipes prepared by the tribals at these huts. “Right from varieties of saags, roots, millets, herbs and leaves, members of various tribes will source these food items from their native villages and will decide on the cost factor of the dishes accordingly,” said Mishra, adding, “We will not meddle in the economics of food or homestay; our job is to provide infrastructure and support.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/covid-slows-down-speed-of-tribal-huts-project/articleshow/84389432.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi
---||Bengaluru||Vaccine target 7 lakh, but Karnataka is struggling to jab 2 lakh a day||BENGALURU: On International Yoga Day (June 21), the state government had announced that it would aim for 7 lakh vaccinations a day but a review of the number of doses administered since shows Karnataka is struggling to inoculate even 2 lakh people on most days. Between June 21 and July 13, the state crossed 3 lakh doses only on three days (see graphic) — June 25, June 28 and July 3 — according to the state Covid bulletin, which captures the data every day at 3.30pm. The lowest daily coverage in this period was on July 11, when only 89,037 doses were administered. The central government took charge of vaccination from June 21, procuring and providing doses to the states and private hospitals. On June 21, Karnataka vaccinated 5.7 lakh people. Buoyed by the performance, health minister Sudhakar said the state would cover 7 lakh vaccinations a day and by that arithmetic, would inoculate every eligible person in Karnataka by the year-end. He went on to say that if each of the 13,000 Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) in the state catered to even 70-80 people a day, the goal would be met. However, supplies have failed to keep up with the plan, crippling the state’s vaccination campaign. Sudhakar recently visited Delhi, seeking 1.5 crore vaccines for the state on a monthly basis. In July so far, 31.2 lakh doses have been administered, against 88 lakh in the entire month of June, 38.6 lakh in May, 57.3 lakh in April and 28.9 lakh in March. This includes beneficiaries who have taken the first or second dose. So far, nearly 2.6 crore vaccine doses have been administered, including 2.1 crore as first dose. Erratic supply of vaccines an issue: BBMPOn June 21, Bengaluru alone vaccinated 1,73,045 people but the number shrank to 75,251 the next day. It increased to 1.1 lakh on June 25, falling to 76,683 on June 30. The city’s lowest coverage recently was on July 11 when 41,995 doses were adminsitered. Dr BK Vijendra, chief health officer of BBMP, said erratic supply of vaccines is an issue. He said 60,000-80,000 people are being vaccinated every day, on average, receiving doses daily on average, both private and government centres put together. “We are getting 40,000-50,000 doses a day. There is no supply on some of the days. If the supply is streamlined, the coverage can be enhanced,” he said. Private hospitals which have been waiting for government supply channels are now relieved as the government portal has started accepting indents. “In Maharashtra, hospitals have started getting supplies. We are expecting the same here too,” said Dr HM Prasanna, president of Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/vaccine-target-7l-but-ktaka-is-struggling-to-jab-2l-a-day/articleshow/84395315.cms||Sunitha Rao R

They also demanded removal of Delhi Transport Corporation chairman Kailash Gahlot from the DTC board to ensure a fair investigation. Later, the BJP functionaries claimed that the LG had assured them that the matter would soon be referred to CBI. “BJP has been for the past 15 days seeking a high-level probe into the scam. We had been asking for a probe by Anti-Corruption Branch, but when the matter regarding Rs 3,500-crore maintenance came to the fore, it became evident it is a bigger scam,” claimed Gupta. Gupta said that even without getting buses, the work order had been issued. “It was only after BJP kept raising this issue that a committee ordered cancellation of the tender regarding maintenance.” Meanwhile, Delhi Congress chief Chaudhary Anil Kumar filed a complaint with CBI demanding a probe into the same issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dtc-scam-bjp-dharna-at-raj-bhavan/articleshow/84424434.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||Bihar: Accused makes rape video viral to stop girl’s marriage||PATNA: The video of a minor girl’s rape in Gopalganj district two years ago has been made viral by one of the five accused as he does not want her to marry someone else. Two of the five accused, all in their 20s now, are working in a Middle East country. Gopalganj SP Anand Kumar has constituted a special investigation team headed by Hathua SDPO Naresh Kumar to arrest the accused, identified as Abhishek Sharma, Dipu Dubey, Nitesh Dubey, Lalu Thakur and Lalji Sharma. Police said Lalu and Lalji are working abroad. He said the video was leaked by Abhishek after he came to know that the girl was going to get married soon. The SP said an FIR was registered at Kateya police station against the five youths on Monday on the victim’s written complaint. SDPO Kumar said Abhishek was having a relation with the victim when the incident took place during Chhath at a village under Kateya police station area of Gopalganj. The victim was hardly 16-year-old then. “The four other accused had caught Abhishek with the girl in an objectionable position and gang-raped her taking advantage of the situation. The victim had not approached the police due to various reasons,” he said. The SDPO said the girl was now going to get married but Abhishek was blackmailing her to marry him instead. “The girl ignored him. He finally leaked the video with the motive to get her marriage cancelled. Infuriated after coming to know about her viral video, the victim went to Abhishek’s house and told him that she was going to approach the police. Abhishek has been absconding since then,” he said. He said the victim then lodged an FIR against the five accused. The SDPO said it will take some time to arrest the two accused working abroad as they will have to be deported to India first. “The SP will write to state police headquarters, which will inform the ministry of home affairs and the ministry of external affairs. Our embassy in the country concerned will be informed to further contact the government there for the duo’s deportation to India,” he said. The SPDO said police need to gather passport, visa and details of the airport from where the two had taken the flights, in order to initiate their deportation process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/accused-makes-rape-video-viral-to-stop-girls-marriage/articleshow/84387142.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Mumbai||Will create thousands of local jobs: Adani on Mumbai airport||DELHI/MUMBAI: Adani Airport Holdings Ltd (AAHL), wholly owned by Adani Enterprises, is now India’s biggest private airport operator in terms of the number of airports (eight) under it—one greenfield and seven operational airports, accounting for 25% airport footfalls. It is now managing and developing India’s second busiest airport, CSMIA, along with Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Mangaluru; it will take over Jaipur, Guwahati and Thiruvananthapuram in the next few months and build Navi Mumbai. “Delighted” group chairman Gautam Adani promised to make “Mumbai proud” and “create thousands of new” local jobs. “Our larger objective is to reinvent airports as ecosystems that drive local economic development and act as the nuclei around which we can catalyse aviation-linked businesses. These include metropolitan developments that span entertainment facilities... smart city developments, and other innovative business concepts,” he said. One of his sons has joined MIAL board as group nominee. At 12% annual growth, AAHL expects its share of passenger traffic to grow from 8 crore in financial year 2020 to 10 crore in FY22. However, with India’s busiest airport—Delhi’s IGIA —and Hyderabad under it and Goa Mopa upcoming, GMR will continue to handle more passengers than Adani. “AAHL will begin construction of NMIA next month and complete the financial closure in the next 90 days. This new international airport will be commissioned in 2024,” the infra major says. Gautam Adani has major plans for those using airports and non-users too by developing them as urban magnets with “an ecosystem of the future for business, leisure and entertainment” on the lines of Singapore’s Changi. Sources say these include restaurants around airports amid the backdrop of aeroplanes taking off and landing, service apartments, snooker and bowling alleys and overall real estate development. Clearly, generating non-aero revenue from outside the terminals is a big part of the group’s airport blueprint. Adani has acquired GVK’s entire 50.5% stake in MIAL and 23.5% stake by two foreign firms (total 74%). The Airports Authority of India holds the remaining 26%. It took over MIAL from GVK following a board meeting on Tuesday and after getting all required approvals from the Centre and state governments and City and Industrial Development Corporation.  With presence in both Tier I and Tier 2, 3 cities, Adani is aiming to create a hub and spoke model—where traffic from smaller cities comes to bigger ones to take connecting flights. “This is fundamental to enabling a greater equalisation of India’s urban-rural divide, as well as making international travel seamless and smooth,” said Adani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/adani-on-mumbai-airport-will-create-thousands-of-local-jobs/articleshow/84391800.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Justice Devan Ramachandran issued the order after considering a petition filed by a 73-year-old man through advocate PC Haridas. An order issued by KSEB sanctioning forcible deduction of amounts from pensions of former employees was challenged by the petitioner. KSEB’s counsel submitted that the order is not intended for forceful deduction and that it was issued on the basis of the agreement with an association of pensioners that its members are willing to contribute one day’s pension to the Vaccine Challenge. In such circumstances, KSEB’s order should not be set aside by the court. If the petitioner does not agree to the contribution, the money will be returned, KSEB’s counsel submitted. While any contribution to the CM’s Relief Fund requires full volition of the contributor, the KSEB’s order does not require consent of the pensioner, the court said while stating that such an order does not deserve the court’s approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vaccine-challenge-hc-orders-refund/articleshow/84389514.cms||---
---||Delhi||Haryana released 16k cusec, crisis to end soon: Chadha||New Delhi: With the monsoon finally arriving in Delhi, the possibility of the water crisis in the city getting resolved has increased. Over 16,000 cusec (8,888 million gallons) of water have, meanwhile, been released in the Yamuna from the Hathnikund barrage in Haryana. Delhi Jal Board (DJB) had earlier stated that the water levels at the Wazirabad barrage had dropped by 7.5 ft causing water supply shortage to the tune of 100 MGD (million gallons per day) in the city. DJB vice-chairman Raghav Chadha on Tuesday said that the Haryana government finally released 16,000 cusec of water after DJB filed a petition in the Supreme Court. “Delhi’s legitimate water share has been released by the Haryana government at Hathnikund and 16,000 cusec of water will reach Delhi’s water treatment plants in the next three days. The water problem in Delhi will end very soon and clean drinking water will reach Delhiites,” he stated. Chadha said that the struggle of people of Delhi had paid off. “We held many rounds of conversation with the Haryana government and even filed a petition in the Supreme Court to fight for the rights of Delhiites.” Delhi depends on its neighbouring states for its raw water needs. “From Uttar Pradesh, water reaches us via the Ganga; from Haryana, water reaches us via the Yamuna; and from Punjab, water reaches us via the Bhakra Nangal dam. Delhi does not have any big water bodies nearby,” Chadha said. He added, “I express my regrets for all the troubles that people of Delhi have gone through.” DJB manages about 14,500 km of water lines to provide water supply and sewerage services to about 20 million people of Delhi. It has capacity of producing 935 MGD water through its nine water treatment plants, ranney wells and tubewells. The Bhagirathi plant produces 108 MGD potable water while the one at Sonia Vihar up to 140 MGD potable water under normal circumstances. Both the major plants are fed by raw water from the Upper Ganga canal. Rest of the raw water comes mainly through the Yamuna, DSB canal and CLC munak canal besides sub-surface sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/haryana-released-16k-cusec-crisis-to-end-soon-chadha/articleshow/84389568.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Garbage already a problem in merged areas, Pune residents foresee an escalation||PUNE: Four years after their inclusion in Pune Municipal Corporation limits, residents of Uruli Devachi and Hadapsar are still struggling to stop the dumping of the entire city’s garbage in their backyards. Their worries have increased after the addition of 23 more villages to PMC’s limits with no clear plans to deal the daily waste generated from these areas. The PMC estimates that the new areas will generate 250 tonne of garbage every day. The rest of the city generates 2,100 tonnes of garbage every dayaround 800 tonnes of wet waste, 700 tonnes are dry trash, and around 600 tonnes of mixed garbage. The civic body has sought details from the respective gram panchayats about garbage management to plan. Residents of Kirkitwadi said daily garbage management is among the top challenges they face. Wagholi residents said the existing waste processing plant in their area cannot handle the daily waste and needs an warrants an upgrade. Dilip Mehta, a resident of Phursungi, said, “We have suffered for decades because of non-effective management of garbage. The situation has improved slightly in the last few months after residents agitated against open dumping. However, we now fear that dumping may go up as the 23 merged villagers do not have a scientific mechanism to treat waste.” Katraj corporator Vasant More said the 11 villages merged with the city areas in 2017 have unresolved garbage related issues. Among the 23 villages Wagholi, Kirkitwadi, Manjari are generating more daily garbage because of an increase in the population. Sanjeev Kumar Patil of Wagholi Housing Societies’ Association said the residents have been following up the garbage issue with the gram panchayat for years. “There is a need to augment garbage processing capacities and initiate strict action against dumping of waste in open plots and burning of waste. No 100% garbage collection takes place,” Patil said. Civic activists want PMC to improve the efficiency of the garbage plants. Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch said, “Many plants are now working at full capacities. Even if these plants operate at their full strength, PMC can handle a big quantum of garbage daily.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/garbage-already-a-problem-in-merged-areas-residents-foresee-an-escalation/articleshow/84391760.cms||Sarang Dastane

Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana said, “Incidents of cyber crime are on rise in the city. The modus operandi of the crime suggests meticulous planning and deft execution. The applicant/accused, Manoj Kumar Hota, is reported to be holding a doctorate degree in management and instead of using his professional expertise for some novel purpose, he chose to earn his livelihood by cheating unemployed youth.” According to police, the complainant had applied for a job and put his resume in a job portal from where he received calls from Hota. Hota allegedly cheated him of Rs 19.74 lakh on the pretext of registration fees for premium services, document verification, top management profile, to qualify aptitude test and for seat reservation. The cops added that the accused had opened three current accounts in the name of three shell companies— Zottic Career Choice Pvt. Ltd, Sandip Edu Solution Pvt. Ltd and BSEPL Educon (OPC) Pvt Ltd.

As the HC is hearing the challenge to the constitutional validity of GujCTOC, the bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Biren Vaishnav questioned if X is a member of a crime syndicate and no FIR has been lodged against him, but Y is facing charges, is it enough to charge X underGujCTOC. “Merely because he is a member of the syndicate, would he be charged under this Act? Will the chargesheet relate to syndicate or to an accused individually?” the judges questioned. In reply, advocate general Kamal Trivedi cited a Bombay HC order and submitted that such member of a crime syndicate is liable to be charge-sheeted under the definition of continuing unlawful activity under MCOCA. He later submitted that such provisions were present in the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act and MCOCA, which has been operative in Maharashtra for long. The judges posed queries on how a chargesheet can be filed against a syndicate, and what if one committed a crime individually when there was no existence of the syndicate at that time. The AG responded that the person can be roped in, if he is connectable with the syndicate in the past. It has to be established he was a syndicate member. The judges expressed concern at the sweeping powers given to cops under the law that on mere accusation, a person can be detained without bail and his right to liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution goes for a toss. The state replied that it is up to the accused to establish that he is not part of the syndicate. The court pointed out that the implementation of this law depends on the police officer shouldering a great responsibility and he has to act honestly and sincerely. “Otherwise, this is blanket power in the hands of police officers to rope in anybody in GujCTOC,” the judges said. The judges also questioned whether GujCTOC has a definition of who is said to be a member of the syndicate. Merely because a person knows a member of the syndicate, he becomes a syndicate member or after sharing of the proceeds of crime. To this, the AG replied that there should be an overt act on the part of the person. He has to be in the loop in the commission of another member’s offence in the past ten years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-questions-gujctoc-provisions/articleshow/84391858.cms||---

The protesters said that the gatherings are posing a threat during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The bandh received overwhelming response as around 400 traders kept their commercial establishments shut and also took out a procession to Nemawar police station, where they submitted a memorandum to senior police officials. Recently, bodies of five members of a tribal family, including three minors, were found buried in a farmhouse. “After the incident, thousands of people affiliated to political parties and other organisations are visiting Nemawar and staging protests on a daily basis, which is causing huge inconvenience to local residents,” the agitators said. They said that ‘outsiders’ have also misbehaved with local traders and violated Covid-19 norms by taking part in huge gatherings, without wearing masks. Senior police officials assured residents of Nemawar that they will take appropriate measures to address the issues concerning them. “We have assured the traders and local residents that we will take appropriate action against those not following Covid norms,” SDOP Prashant Bhadoria said. Congress workers stage protest: Congress workers on Tuesday staged a protest at Sayaji Gate in Dewas over Bhopal police lodging an FIR against former chief minister and Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh. Congress workers burnt effigies of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and cops had to use water-cannons to disperse the crowd. The agitation resulted in frequent traffic jams on the busy AB Road. Congress workers demanded immediate withdrawal of the FIR filed against Digvijaya. According to police officials, video recordings of the protest are being checked to identify the protesters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/nemawar-observes-bandh-to-protest-political-gatherings/articleshow/84389548.cms||---

The groups, including the Federation of Gujarat State Secondary Teachers Union and Federation of Gujarat State Secondary and Higher Secondary Teachers Union, have adopted a three-pronged strategy to press for their demands, the associations said. As the first step, they will make a representation of their demands to the state education minister, legislators, district collectors, and senior education department officers on July 20. Next, they plan to stage a dharna with the support of former Gujarat education board members and other former education department officials, said sources. As the last resort, the teachers plan to hold a day-long hunger strike in Gandhinagar. All the protests and demonstrations will be carried out while following Covid-19 norms and after taking the necessary permissions from police and other government authorities, said sources. The teachers have been demanding a fixed-pay service period of five years for determining seniority and promotions, the implementation of the old pension scheme, and a separate pay grade for primary teachers. “In 2019, the government had agreed to meet their demands, but they have not been met so far,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/teachers-plan-hunger-strike/articleshow/84391864.cms||---

He said the very concept of censoring is anachronistic and authoritarian in a democratic society as it is a manifestation of the lack of trust between the people and the rulers. Adoor was inaugurating a webinar organised jointly by the Kerala Chalachitra Academy and MES Asmabi College, Kodungallur on Monday. He said censorship was a system introduced by the colonial rulers who wanted to thwart any form of criticisms against them. But even 75 years after Independence, Indian rulers have not shunned this system which goes against the basic character of the Constitution. Adoor said no government should create a situation where people will be forced to live with fear. There can be reasonable restrictions on freedom of expression to avert anarchy, but this should not lead to stifling of all forms of dissent. The interests of the ruling party or those in power should not be projected as national interest, and those opposing the rulers should not be dumped as anti-nationals, he said. Chalachitra Academy chairman Kamal and MES president Fazal Gafoor were among those who spoke.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/adoor-blasts-new-cinematograph-bill/articleshow/84389618.cms||---

---||Pune||Covid-19: 61 cases of Delta-plus, three casualties, says NCDC chief Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh||PUNE: India has so far detected 61 cases of the Delta-plus variant of the coronavirus and registered three deaths due to it, said Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), on Tuesday. Madhya Pradesh reported two deaths (both patients had not received their vaccines) while Maharashtra had one death. On June 25, India had 48 cases of Deltaplus. Singh said no deaths have been reported from among the Delta-plus cases over the last few days. He added that it’s yet to be firmly established if the variant was more dangerous than others. “Only after the death rate in Delta-Plus cases is compared to data from cases involving other variants can an inference be drawn. But so far, the variant does not seem to be more severe,” he said. Anurag Agarwal, the head of the CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology also said, "We have so far not seen increased severity or transmissibility for Delta plus lineages AY.1 or AY.2 in India or globally." Dr Agarwal said that AY.1 /AY.2 could be slightly less transmissible than the Delta variant or the same in transmissibility since new cases have fallen globally in relation to Delta. Experts from INSACOG said the largest number of Delta-plus cases have been reported from states currently carrying out extensive whole genome sequencing of a considerable number of SARS-CoV-2 samples. Delta-plus is essentially Delta with a mutation, an expert said. It now has three lineages — AY.1, AY.2 and AY.3 — all containing the K417N mutation on the coronavirus spike. Besides India, Delta-plus has been detected in countries that had earlier reported the Delta variant, including the US and UK. A senior INSACOG scientist said, “None of the countries that have reported Delta-plus have shown an enormous increase in Covid cases. The variant could then be only as transmissible as Delta and not more. We also do not expect an enormous increase in Delta-plus cases as it has been found in regions where Delta has already infected a significant chunk of the population. It is, therefore, likely that people in these regions may already have some immunity against Delta-plus, which evolved from Delta variant.” The scientist, however, said one concern is that the same mutation (K417N) in Delta has occurred independently in different regions of the world. Another INSACOG scientist said, “If there was something alarming about Delta-plus, we would have known of it by now, because the variant has been around for some time.” Sources said about 3,600 samples from Maharashtra, from June, are currently being analysed for Delta-plus at the Delhi-based IGIB. Results are likely to be out in a week, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/61-cases-of-delta-plus-3-casualties-ncdc-chief/articleshow/84391806.cms||Neha Madaan

The dim and slanting beam of their motorcycle’s headlight had suddenly fallen on two tigers lazing around a road that cut through the jungles of Pilibhit. It was dark, the rider panicked and the three men fell right next to the big cats. The animals sprung, their huge paws outstretched. Vikas Kumar's two friends were killed within minutes. He survived though. One of the tigers had grabbed him by the head. But he was wearing a helmet. Vikas, 23, lived to tell the tale. As the tiger recoiled in surprise having bitten into the rock hard surface of his helmet, he took the opportunity to clamber up a nearby tree. He stayed there, behind the branches, the whole night as the tigers, having killed both his friends and eaten one of them, growled below. Shivering in dread, Vikas saw the tigers tear apart Sonu Kumar (22). Kandhai Lal (35) was dragged back into the deep forests of the reserve. The next day villagers found one half of his body. Recounting the events of the terrifying Sunday night (July 11), Vikas said, “We were warned about the tigers’ presence at the entrance of the forest, but decided to take the route anyway as we were in a hurry to reach home. Sonu was riding the motorcycle while Kandhai and I were pillion. Due to the bad headlight, we could not see the two tigers. We came too close and they charged at us. One of the tigers pounced on me but I was saved by my helmet. Sonu and Kandhai couldn't make it." Vikas said Kandhai also tried to climb a tree but was pulled down by the beasts. “I could hear his screams for a few seconds and then it stopped. Sonu was killed in front of me. I was extremely scared but gathered courage to jump onto another tree later. I didn’t move one bit, closed my eyes and started praying. I knew that if the tigers found my location they would kill me for sure. They are known to climb trees.” Help came for Vikas the next morning when a few villagers passed by and he hollered at them. “The tigers continued to roam below, searching for me. I heard their roar all night. They went into the forest early morning, around 3.30am. At sunrise, I got a new lease of life with some of my fellow villagers helping me down. I will never be able to forget this,” Vikas said. Rajendra Prasad, one of those who reached the spot, said, “We informed the police and forest department after we saw the man, frozen with fear almost and barely able to speak. A bike was lying nearby and next to it was a body. There were claw marks on the tree.” Deputy director of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve Naveen Khandelwal told TOI, “We found pugmarks of two tigers at the spot. One of the tigers seems to be a sub-adult. There is a possibility that an adult tigress was playing with a sub-adult male as she was sighted by our staff. But we will be in a better position to confirm once we have the images of the tigers. As of now, we have increased camera traps to 26 and teams will monitor the area during evening hours as well.” Back from a hospital and now at his modest house in Deuria, Pilibhit, Vikas said, "The tigers will always live in my head. I will hear them growl for the rest of my years on this earth."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/tiger-bit-my-head-but-i-had-helmet-on-survivor/articleshow/84387176.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

According to commuters who take the route on a regular basis, the issue of streetlights not working persisted for several days before the officials took stock of the matter recently. “The commuters could hardly see what was ahead of them for the past few months when these lights were not functioning. It was becoming very difficult to drive there and people were risking accidents due to this problem. I am glad the authorities took notice of the news published and finally got them fixed,” said Manav Parikh, a citizen reporter who highlighted the issue. Commuters also said that if complaints regarding streetlights are not resolved on priority basis, it can become a very serious problem, especially during rains. “There was a time when the civic authorities would repair dysfunctional streetlights within a day or two after we raise a complaint. Now, it is taking at least a week. This needs to be changed or these places might turn into accident prone zones,” said Shruti Rao, a resident of Somajiguda. Meanwhile, the GHMC mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi who has been inspecting the civic works across the city directed the GHMC officials to address these matters and rectify them immediately. During a recent interaction with TOI, she said, “Complaints regarding streetlights are being attended to on a day-to-day basis and rectified immediately.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-fixes-dysfunctional-streetlight-at-necklace-road/articleshow/84391844.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Olympic bid: Two agencies in fray to create roadmap for Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Just as bids for consultants — to prepare a roadmap for Ahmedabad’s dream of hosting the 2036 Olympics — were opened on Tuesday, the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) found two agencies, competing for the job. During the last pre-bid meeting held on June 8, eight to 10 agencies had approached AUDA. The consulting firms had queries on revising the time schedule for submission of bids and also sought clarifications on guidelines mentioned in AUDA’s offer document. A senior official told TOI, “Certain consultants demanded more time to prepare robust proposals. Initially there were international groups that had approached us, but on Tuesday we learned that many had opted out,” said a senior official. It will now be up to AUDA’s board to decide on whether to call a fresh round of expressions of interest (EOIs) to accommodate more players in the bidding process or continue with the two contenders. The documents will be analysed by experts from the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and AUDA. AUDA, the city’s apex urban planning body, had on June 8 invited proposals from consultants to assess venues and infrastructure required to host the Games. The centre of the Olympics games will be the Rs 4,118 crore upcoming SVP Sports Enclave on the riverfront near Bhat village. The winning consultant has to provide a comprehensive document which assesses sports and non-sports venues and city infrastructure for hosting the games and to identify options for host cities for the Olympics. The consultant, once chosen, will prepare the roadmap, the second major task will be to engage in ‘continuous and targeted dialogue’ for the Olympic bid and conform with IOC rules, the Olympic charter and IOC code of ethics. A Gujarat government proposal sent to the Union ministry of youth affairs and sports mentions that a special purpose vehicle (SPV) will be formed would be hoping for generous funding. The government is yet to collaborate with AUDA. The state-central government share in the funding will be 30%-70% or 50% each,” an official of the urban development department said. The official added, “We are also exploring the possibility of attracting Rs 1,100 crore in private investment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/olympic-bid-2-agencies-in-fray-to-create-roadmap/articleshow/84391946.cms||---

In a statement, Bidhuri said that many parts of the capital reported waterlogging after downpour; from Shakarpur Chungi to ITO, there was a massive traffic jam. . “It caused a great deal of hardship to the people, but the AAP government is not bothered. I had raised this issue well before the arrival of monsoon. We had also brought this matter to the notice of the lieutenant governor and urged him to order an inquiry into the cleaning of the sewers as all the work had been done on papers, but nothing had moved on ground,’’ Bidhuri alleged. Bidhuri sought a probe into the whole exercise of cleaning of drains, the funds spent on it and who all were involved. Despite repeated attempts, TOI could not get a reaction from the AAP government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/waterlogging-exposed-govt-claims-says-bjp/articleshow/84389658.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Though it was described as a courtesy visit, according to reports, the three leaders told Pawar that the statement made by Patole was twisted by a section of the media. H K Patil also had a series of meetings with Congress leaders and activists over the ensuing elections to local bodies. “We are preparing for elections to 24 zilla parishads, 144 municipal councils and 22 municipal corporations,” Patil said. On Patole’s statement, Patil said it was unfortunate that the statement was twisted for political reasons. “Patole has already clarified his position. His target was the Narendra Modi-led NDA government and not the MVA government,” he said. On the speaker’s post, Patil claimed there was no dispute, and as decided by the MVA partners, it will remain with the Congress. Even the Shiv Sena and NCP have clarified their stand. “The speaker could not be elected during the legislature’s monsoon session owing to Covid-19. I am sure a new speaker will be elected soon,” he said. Patole said the NDA government led by Modi was making efforts to divert the attention of people from core issues. “The NDA government has failed to halt spiralling prices of essential commodities. The Congress has launched a statewide agitation to protest against high prices. The PM has also failed to provide anti-Covid vaccines,” he said. Patole alleged that from recent developments, it is clear that BJP “is taking revenge on members of the OBC community.” “It utilized senior OBC leaders Gopinath Munde, Eknath Khadse and Pankaja Munde, but throughout their political career, they were sidelined,” he claimed. Further, Patole alleged that BJP was desperate to dislodge the MVA government but said it will not succeed. “Why are the CBI and ED not probing former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh, who made baseless allegations against Anil Deshmukh?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-congress-netas-meet-pawar-say-patoles-remark-twisted/articleshow/84391896.cms||---

While discussing the functioning of the jail and the challenges faced by the authorities, the team was informed that it had 275 inmates, out of which 240 are undertrials and 35 convicts.

Considering the number of inmates, DCW recommended engaging five lawyers. The inmates are usually allowed to meet their family members in a designated room under the Mulakat programme, but it has been suspended due to Covid-19. DCW suggested resuming the programme till the time Covid stays under control. To ensure rehabilitation of these women, the authorities have introduced fashion designing, make-up and computer courses, and also yoga and vipassna practices, but all have been put on hold due to absence of proper teachers and trainers. While the women inmates engaged in various jobs on the premises get minimum wages, the government deducts Rs 340 as living expenses, while the inmates who don’t work don’t have to pay any charge. To encourage women to work, DCW recommended abolition of these charges for everybody. Among the items made under the brand name TJ’s are clothes, office files, biscuits, namkeens and jewellery. These products are already sold outside. Recommending widescale promotion of these products, DCW said the government should encourage its departments to buy products from Tihar to help these women’s rehabilitation. It was found that a well equipped creche for toddlers and other young children living with their mothers on the premises lacks teachers and caretakers. As it hampers the children’s growth, DCW suggested deployment of efficient personnel. The commission also recommended regular sensitisation of the jail staff, addition of more books in the library, and initiating deaddiction programmes. Maliwal said, “Almost 80% of the inmates are undertrials. Reforms need to be undertaken to ensure that when released, the women can restart their lives and leave crime.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dcw-red-flags-congested-cells-for-women-at-tihar/articleshow/84391893.cms||---

PMPML has been running under heavy losses since the pandemic and services are still not at 100%. It will be a major task to find ways to increase the non-fare revenue,” PMP Pravasi Manch’s Sanjay Shitole said. PMPML is running 1,000 buses and its daily income was highest at Rs70.61 lakh on Monday since the utility resumed on June 6. “The past few months have seen several steps like the ATAL bus service, the airport bus service and the recent Punyadarsham services. But the low passenger traffic is a concern,” a PMPML official said. “The average daily ridership before the pandemic was 11 lakh since 2010. It shows that people don’t really bank on PMPML. The situation ca change only if PMPML can ensure good buses and punctuality,” Shitole said. Santosh Joshi, a regular commuter, said, “We just want the buses to run on time.

As tall buildings tend to attract lightning more, the historic fort situated on a hill has been struck thrice in a decade. If authorities do not wake up now, the lightning may continue to claim more lives and cause severe damage to the historic building. According to staff, at present only one lighting arrester at Dil Aram Bagh is installed in the fort which covers about 11-km area in its periphery. Before this incident, in 2013 lighting strike claimed the lives of two residents near Maota. Similarly, in 2019, damage of property was caused at the Jaleb Chowk after lightning struck again. Abhishek Sharma, an architect and expert in installing lighting protection system, said, “There are reports that lightning strikes almost on similar geographical locations in similar patterns. As Amber Fort is attracting this natural disaster, lightning protection devices should be installed to avoid casualties.” After the previous incidents, the Amber Development and Management Authority (ADMA) had decided to install eight lighting arresters, however, they have failed to implement due to lackadaisical approach. An official at ADMA said, “In a meeting on Tuesday, it was decided to carry out to survey to install these arresters at strategic locations. The work will be started soon once survey is completed.” Following this, the state town planning wing has also geared up to carry out a survey of buildings to check lighting arresters. The National Building Code 2016 has laid down detailed norms for installation of lightning and protection devices and each building is supposed to be catered for lightning protection against vertical and lateral strikes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/amber-officials-yet-to-install-8-diverters/articleshow/84391892.cms||---

He had claimed that the three women he chatted with incessantly were his “sisters”. The three were unaware that the man was already married and had a child. According to Abhayam 181 helpline, a woman called after being subjected to domestic violence by her husband. The man used to beat her up when she demanded explanation of why he was away frequently. They had fallen in love and married 10 years ago. They also had an eight year-old boy. Suspecting he had an extramarital affair, the woman began snooping and found suspicious messages on his phone that hinted at an intimate relationship. She raised the issue with her in-laws who asked her not to pursue the matter further. “She decided to take matters in her own hand and called up the three women whose contacts she had got. The three confirmed that the man had a romantic relationship with them and had hidden his marital status from them. She then called them to one place and confronted the man who had no answer,” said a counsellor. “The man was counselled by the team and was asked to end his extramarital relationships.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wife-catches-man-having-three-affairs/articleshow/84391927.cms||---

Defence lawyer Ajith Prabhav argued that the snake charmer Chavarkadu Suresh’s statement that he handed over the viper to main accused Sooraj as demanded by him to catch a rat from the farmland could not be believed. “Nobody will buy a snake to catch rats. So Suresh’s claim that he sold the snake to Sooraj could not be trusted,” he said. Special prosecutor G Mohanraj pointed out that no one would tell the truth that he was purchasing a poisonous snake as part of committing a murder. “Suresh of Chavarkadu, Kalluvathukkal, hadn’t met Sooraj on February 18, 2020 at Chathannur and at Enathu on April 24, 2020. The phone location should not be taken as evidence,” Prabhav said. He argued that Uthra had not sustained snake bite and that she sought treatment for a medicine reaction. However, the hospital officials had given her medicine for snake bite, he claimed. Court passed an order to ensure Sooraj’s presence in court only through online mode. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/uthra-didnt-sustain-snake-bite-says-defence-lawyer/articleshow/84389707.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Even as not a single case of Zika infection has been reported in the state, the health department has stepped in fast to form an expert committee for work on preventing the virus from striking the state. “Amidst the threat of a third wave, we cannot afford a Zika virus outbreak. Hence, there has to be a proper surveillance as a preventive measure,” said a senior health official. The state health department has already alerted district health officials to keep an eye on any suspected case and report the same to Swsathya Bhawan. Doctors said that mosquito-borne infection cannot pose a threat like that of Covid-19 and can be controlled with effective vector control measures but it has overlapping symptoms with dengue and chikungunia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-gears-up-to-keep-zika-at-bay/articleshow/84389635.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Later, he spun a story of her abduction before police. As he kept changing his statements, the cops questioned him intensely and found out that he had killed his daughter. The accused, Dhamesh Devipujak , 35, a resident of Khoda village in Sanand, had first approached Sanand police on July 9 saying that he had dropped his daughter somewhere and as he was drunk, he had forgotten the place. He pleaded before the cops to find out his missing daughter and the cops immediately began a search for the girl. On July 10, he again appeared with a new story of abduction and told cops that he and his daughter had gone to a market place near Hansalpur and when they were returning some unknown persons abducted his daughter. On July 11, he came up with another story saying that he and his daughter were offered chocolates laced with some sedatives and after eating the chocolates he went unconscious and when he regained consciousness, he found himself near Narmada canal. When cops checked his claims, they found with CCTV footage and human intelligence that no such incident took place there. On the same day, police found his daughter’s body from Narmada canal. The cops summoned him again and questioned him regarding the case and about variations in his statements. This time, he broke down before the cops and said that he had killed his daughter by throwing her in Narmada canal as no one was ready to marry off their daughter with him because he was already father of a girl from his first marriage. He said before cops that he had on July 5 made the first attempt of killing his daughter by injecting insecticides into her. As she survived, he took her to the Narmada canal in the garb of shopping and later threw her in it. He later went to a hotel in Chotila and the next day returned to Sanand, approached the cops and narrated the story of abduction. Police booked him in a case of murder and criminal conspiracy and began an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/father-kills-7-yr-old-spins-stories/articleshow/84389660.cms||---

The survey will be conducted by the Council Of Scientific And Industrial Research–Central Building Research Institute (CSIR–CBRI), which is supported by IIT-Roorkee. “It is a coincidence that a lightning struck at a time when we are planning a major assessment,” said Mugdha Sinha, secretary of art, literature, culture and archaeology, adding it was very important to know impact of summer, winters, rain, lightning and humidity on the structure. “Other factors such as geology of the site to better understand how to conserve the fort,” said Sinha.

The duo managed to hoodwink the authorities by eluding the cameras on the station and changing their shirts once outside the premises to avoid being caught on the cameras outside. According to railway officials, the woman, C N Dayal, a resident of Diva had boarded the second general coach of a Kalyan slow local from Mulund at 11am. The train had halted at Thane station when the two unidentified men who were lurking in the coach snatched her gold chain and fled. “The men had probably trailed the woman from Mumbai. After we checked the CCTV footage, we saw they were eluding the cameras before they exited towards the MSRTC depot. Footage showed they changed their shirts once outside the station premises,” said a police official.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Shut all nine bars till probe ends, excise department asks Park Street hotel||KOLKATA: The state excise department on Tuesday asked The Park to shut its nine bars till the probe into the late-night party at the Park Street hotel continued. The hotel did not issue any statement after the state excise move. The detective department, which apprised the excise department of the raid on the party, which was being held in the hotel corridor with loud music around 1.15am on Sunday, much beyond the Covid-restriction deadline, has now summoned the floor manager, the food and beverages manager and the DJ who were present, either serving guests or performing. “We have sent notice and asked a few of them, attached with The Park, to appear at Lalbazar on Wednesday. They were present on the second and third floors of the hotel that night. We are sending notice to a few others,” said a detective department officer. ARS officers, who have scanned CCTV footage and guest lists, will record their statements. According to sources, the three summoned will be asked about their roles at the hotel that night, who engaged them and whether they were aware of the night curfew or not. Their summons were based on the statements of those taken into police custody and CCTV evidence. Of the 37 people rounded up from the hotel early on Sunday, 28 got bail but nine were sent to police custody. “We will see whether their statements match with that of the others present. We will also cross-check with CCTV footage. If required, we will find out the standard procedures followed in other hotels. Their statements will help us know the number of invitees and those who left before we arrived,” said an officer. “We have sent cigarette butts and glasses for forensic test. Till the reports arrive, we will use statements and technical evidence to build on the case. If need be, we will decide whether we need to summon someone else or not.” Police said they also wanted the hotel to submit the CCTV footage of the second and third floors on Saturday-Sunday nights. “Those in police custody have been questioned. We have collected evidence that there was no birthday party that night, as some claimed during the raid. The guest list had been prepared well in advance for the weekend,” said the detective department officer. TOI on Tuesday tried to contact The Park authorities but did not receive any response till the report was filed. Last Sunday though, the hotel authorities in a statement had said: “We have been in the business of hospitality for over five decades and have been part of employment creation and economic progress of the State. Guest and Staff safety being our utmost priority, the bars and restaurants at our hotel are based on Covid-19 protocols. Many of our patrons and their friends or families book stays in the hotel as a weekend getaway on a regular basis. We are complying with all rules and regulations and will continue to do so and there has been no violation. We are fully cooperating with the authorities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shut-all-nine-bars-till-party-probe-ends-excise-dept-asks-hotel/articleshow/84389659.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai police inspector caught taking Rs 22L bribe gets job back||MUMBAI: A police inspector dismissed from service after being caught by the state Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) while accepting a bribe of Rs 22 lakh in 2019 was reinstated two months ago, despite objections from the commissioner of police. The reinstatement move began in 2019, when the BJP-Sena government was in power, but was put on the backburner following objections. Finally, in May this year, the current MVA government gave the go-ahead for his reinstatement. On January 1, 2019, police inspector Anand Bhoir, who was then attached to the crime branch, was arrested for allegedly accepting Rs 22 lakh from Ashok Patel, a liquor shop owner in Fort. Patel has so far trapped more than 130 public servants in bribery and extortion cases. Bhoir had raided a godown at JB Nagar in Andheri and seized 945 illegally imported liquor bottles worth over Rs 16.3 lakh and arrested one person. He then allegedly threatened to book Patel for being part of the gang. He allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs 25 lakh for not arresting Patel. The complainant approached the ACB and Bhoir was caught accepting Rs 22 lakh in Andheri. The bribery case is still pending before the ACB court. In September 2019, the then police commissioner Sanjay Barve dismissed Bhoir after a departmental inquiry found him guilty. Bhoir approached the then minister of state for home Ranjit Patil, who stayed the order and directed his reinstatement. When Barve objected to the reinstatement, the minister stayed his order. Sources said after the MVA government came to power, Bhoir’s reinstatement issue cropped up again. Bhoir’s file was taken up for review and the stay was lifted, said a senior police officer. In the inquiry, Bhoir was found guilty of tweaking the police investigation to benefit the accused and benefit himself monetarily. Bhoir was dismissed under the provisions of the Bombay Police (Punishment and Appeals) Rules, 1956. Bhoir had filed an appeal before the home department for reinstatement stating that he was illegally dismissed from the services and bribery cannot be grounds for his dismissal and there are several public servants caught in bribery cases and all cannot be dismissed from the services. He stated that he had a good track record of solving sensational cases while serving in Mumbai and Thane police. Bhoir, currently posted in the control room in the eastern region, declined to comment. Joint commissioner of police (administration) Rajkumar Watkar said he had been reinstated based on the orders from the state home department. He declined to comment further. The home department and former police commissioner Param Bir Singh is already facing flak over the reinstatement of assistant police inspector Sachin Waze back in the force after 16 years. Waze was dismissed from service after he was arrested in the planting of gelatines in a vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s bungalow and subsequent murder of the vehicle owner Mansukh Hiran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/city-police-inspector-caught-taking-rs-22l-bribe-gets-job-back/articleshow/84393917.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Kolkata||Reduced commission forces private buses to stay off roads||Kolkata: Commuters in the city are in for more trouble. Several private bus drivers and conductors alleged that the bus owners have asked them to take a cut in their commission. With limited ticket sales, the decision has led several bus workers to stop plying, especially in routes towards north and northern suburbs of the city. Bus routes like 30C, 30C/1 from Hatiara and 46 from Airport Gate 1 did not hit the road at all. According to several drivers and conductors that TOI spoke to — from routes 218 in the southern suburbs to route 24A within the city — they have been asked to take a commission cut ranging from 2%to 3%. “When buses had two doors, 24% commission was reserved by drivers and conductors. When it was reduced to one door, the driver’s commission was fixed at 15% and the conductor was paid 9% of the sales. But since Monday, the owners are insisting that drivers settle between 10-12% of commission and the conductors another 6-8%. This would mean earning no more than Rs 300-450 a day given the condition of ticket sales at present. We have to look at other alternatives,” said Naru Singha, driver on route 237. Prabir Singh, another driver on route 24A agreed. “The three complete trips — where we slog for 12-13 hours — is fetching us barely enough to make ends meet. A further cut would mean we can as well join the construction industry where working hours at least will be limited or sell vegetables and other perishables,” he said. Titu Saha, general secretary of City Suburban Bus Service, stated that 12-6% commission model was here to stay. “Routes 3C/1, 219, 221, 223, 235, 12C, 12C/1A, 259 and 13 have already implemented this,” he said. Tapan Banerjee, general secretary of the Joint Council Of Bus Syndicate said, “Fare revision is the only option. The drivers and conductors are those who run the show. We cannot give up on them in these challenging times. The passengers are willing to pay extra. We have collected over 5000 signatures across Kolkata and districts in support of fare hike. We will submit them to the chief minister Mamata Banerjee and transport minister Firhad Hakim.” By evening, commuters were forced to wait for long durations at Esplanade and Dalhousie. “I availed a bus after waiting for over one-and-a-half-hours at Sealdah to return to Taratala. I risked my life by boarding the packed bus amid Covid situation as I had no other option,” said Zeeshan Haider, a passenger. Commuters also claimed each route was charging a different fare. “From Behala Chowrasta to Sealdah costs Rs 15-20 depending on the route. Yet another route is charging Rs 20 till Shyambazar. This is leading to a lot of confusion and angst among passengers,”said Salil Samanta, who travels from Behala Chowrasta to Shyambazar everyday for work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/reduced-commission-forces-private-buses-to-stay-off-roads/articleshow/84389717.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Police arrested the accused, who was under the influence of alcohol at the time of committing the offence. The woman is stable, recuperating at a hospital in Chevella. At 12.45 am on Tuesday, K Ram Reddy, supervisor at the agricultural land of M Ashok Reddy in Kethireddypally village of Moinabad, lodged a complaint alleging that D Ramesh, 28, who works at his employer’s agricultural land, had killed his son, Dinesh, and stabbed his wife, Shobha. The complainant told police that Ramesh, a divorcee, fell in love with Shobha, also a divorcee, and married her four years ago. Shobha has a son from her first marriage and after the second marriage, 23-months-ago she gave birth to a son, Rajesh. On June 25, Ramesh was employed by Ashok Reddy at the agricultural land and his family moved to Kethreddypally. On July 12 to celebrate Shobha’s birthday, her mother visited the family. “In the night, while Ramesh was consuming liquor, Shobha and her mother were talking to each other in their native, Lambada language, while making rotis. Ramesh thought that they were abusing him for not working hard and assaulted Shobha with a stone,” deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Shamshabad, N Prakash Reddy said. When supervisor Ram Reddy reached there and tried to stop Ramesh, the latter picked up a knife and stabbed Shobha. Subsequently, he entered the house and latched the door from inside. “At 10.45 pm, Ramesh came out of the room and left the place. Shobha’s mother found the young Dinesh lying dead in a pool of blood with a cut on his throat,” the DCP said. Shobha was shifted to Chevella government hospital for treatment and her condition is stable. Police arrested Ramesh at Moinabad on Tuesday. They said further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/farm-worker-slits-throat-of-son-stabs-wife-in-moinabad/articleshow/84389695.cms||---

The suspect Sudhir More (54), who works as a watchman had fled to Bengaluru with the booty. The Pimpri police team led by senior inspector Milind Waghmare have recovered 388gm gold ornaments and Rs 10.4 lakh from More, which the latter’s son Umesh had received as his share. Meanwhile, wife of the main suspect in the case also handed over Rs6.14 lakh to the police, which her husband got as his share. “In total the police have recovered cash and gold ornaments worth Rs 83.6 lakh, which is the part of extorted cash and gold ornaments,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said.

---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Bollywood steps in to give second chance to 60-year-old blind elephant, Nina||AGRA: Nina, a 60-yearr-old abused and blind elephant, received medical care for the first time in her life after several Bollywood celebrities took to social media to lend their voice and support to her. Over 60,000 signatures have so far been collected on the petition to “help Nina” to prevent blind elephants from suffering abuse. Their efforts have prodded the authorities to act. Wildlife SOS, an NGO, and the forest department have shifted the geriatric elephant to the Elephant Hospital in Mathura for treatment and care. Dr Ilayaraja, deputy director of veterinary services at Wildlife SOS, said, “Nina suffers from a degenerative joint condition that affects her hind limbs. Her forelimbs are affected due to compensatory weight bearing. Both eyes are damaged completely, possibly due to external trauma and lack of medical attention. She has been placed under a carefully calibrated diet to regain her strength.” For Nina’s mahout-cum-owner, the elephant was nothing more than a commodity to be exploited for commercial use – begging on the streets and taking part in wedding processions. Despite being blind, weak, elderly, severely malnourished, and suffering from arthritis and fused joints in her legs, she was forced to trudge through busy streets amid the cacophony of traffic and crowds from wedding to wedding. No one cared to notice how these unfamiliar noises frightened and confused the blind animal or the trail of tears that had dried up. Any slackness at work was rewarded with a sharp jab of the bull hook (ankush) by her owner-mahout. When Nina was not being worked, she was tightly shackled by a spiked chain which prevented her from lying down and resting. Even during the pandemic, this elephant was made to work. Respite from this painful routine came when Bollywood celebrities such as Athiya Shetty, Shruti Haasan, Randeep Hooda, Vivek Oberoi, Adil Hussain, Ramona Arena, Pia Trivedi, Bani J, Pooja Batra and Suchitra Pillai, and even popular US TV series, “Modern Family”, star Nolan Gould joined in to show their support by signing the petition to help Nina and sharing the same on their respective social media accounts. At the Wildlife SOS Elephant Hospital in Mathura, Nina now has the comfort of a dedicated team of experienced elephant veterinarians and care staff who are trying to reduce her pain and discomfort. So far, an ultrasound of her damaged eyes has been done, X-rays taken of her fragile bones besides blood tests and other tests have been carried out to assess her health status. The Wildlife SOS veterinary team has also developed an intensive treatment plan for her that involves hydrotherapy, laser therapy and healthy nutrition to help reduce her pain and suffering while addressing her health issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/bollywood-steps-in-to-give-2nd-chance-to-60-yr-old-blind-elephant-nina/articleshow/84387273.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

In a joint initiative to address this concern, Aurangabad district administration, the local civic body and different industries and business associations have undertaken a campaign to raise public awareness about CAB. The five-day campaign, which will last till July 16, is being supported by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Chamber of Marathawada Industries and Agriculture (CMIA), Marathwada Association of Small Scale Industries and Agriculture (MASSIA) and Aurangabad Jilha Vyapari Mahasangh (AJVM), an apex body of local traders. CII Marathwada chairman Raman Ajgaonkar said that every responsible citizen must show adherence to CAB to contain the spread of Covid-19. “The Covid-Appropriate Behaviour is a set of simple measures which can have a huge impact on preventing the spread of the infection. The basics such as wearing of face-mask, maintaining hand-hygiene and avoiding crowding should become a norm to avoid fresh outbreak of the disease,” he said. As a part of awareness campaign, rallies with limited participation involving only vaccinated individuals are being carried out to spread awareness about the CAP. The campaign is also encouraging Covid vaccination and dispelling myths associated with it. CII office-bearer Mukund Kulkarni said that industries with the highest number of Covid vaccinations are being felicitated as a part of the ongoing campaign. “While the vaccination of industrial workforce has started on a promising note, we hope that all employees and workers from industries get immunized as early as possible. Many industries have already suffered irrevocable loss during the pandemic and vaccination can be one of the effective tools in the future fight against Covid-19,” he said. Aurangabad on Tuesday reported eight fresh cases of Covid-19, taking the tally of active cases to 49.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/amid-lowering-of-guards-awareness-campaign-for-cab/articleshow/84389653.cms||---

Health minister Raghu Sharma said, “Four samples each tested positive for the Kappa variant from Jaipur and Alwar, two from Barmer and one from Bhilwara.” The numbers are based on the test reports from the genome sequencing labs. Out of the 11 cases, two tested positive for the Kappa variant at a genome sequencing laboratory at Sawai Man Singh Hospital, while nine tested positive at a laboratory in Delhi. The minister said the Kappa variant was not as virulent as the Delta strain. The Kappa variant, which is a double mutant strain of Covid and also known as B.1.167.1, was first reported in the country in October 2020. Due to its complex nature, the World Health Organisation identified it as a “variant of interest”. Health department has been sending the samples for genome sequencing for the past few months to find out if any new variant is circulating in the state. The state has already reported one Delta+ variant case recently in Bikaner. However, no case of Lambda variant has been reported yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/11-samples-test-ve-for-kappa-in-state-4-from-city/articleshow/84392014.cms||---

An x-ray revealed that she had been shot with an air gun and the pellet had entered through the ear and lodged close to her brain. After almost a fortnight, veterinary doctors managed to surgically remove the pellet successfully on Tuesday. The cat was brought to an animal care centre on Piplaj Road on May 30. The vets attending to her said that the cat was brutally shot by an unknown person. “The animal’s eyes had shrunken and the pellet entry wound had healed too. Clearly, the pellet was lodged in her for almost a month,” said Poorvi Rahul, trustee of Shree Danev Foundation. “An x-ray revealed that the pellet had lodged just where the optical nerve and other sensory nerves converged. It was an intricate surgery. Had it gone wrong, she would have gone into a coma,” says Dr Kunal Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/airgun-pellet-pulled-out-from-cat/articleshow/84391942.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Vaccine crisis affects people awaiting second dose||AURANGABAD: The slump in immunization drive being observed currently, which is attributed to the inadequate supply of vaccines, has been affecting those awaiting the second dose. Troubled citizens are now approaching local political leaders for help who, in turn, are requesting the health authorities to ensure smooth supply of vaccines. In a memorandum submitted to the government on behalf of such citizens, the local unit of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has stated that around 50,000 beneficiaries are awaiting the second dose of vaccine. “The total number of vaccination sites in Aurangabad has sharply come down to three from earlier 80 plus sites, which is a reason to worry. On one hand, the government has reintroduced Covid-related curbs fearing fresh outbreak of the disease while on other hand it is failed to carry out mass immunization at the desired speed,” MNS district president Suhas Dashrathe said. Citing the woes faced by citizens in getting the second dose due to dearth of vaccines, local MNS leader Ashok Pawar said that adequate supply of vaccine was essential to negate the possibility of the third-wave of Covid-19. When contacted, health officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) Dr Neeta Padalkar said that smooth vaccine supply has emerged as an issue in the recent past. “Currently, two doses of Covishield are being administered at the interval of 12-16 weeks (84 days). As there is no harm if the second dose gets slightly delayed further, citizens should not panic,” she said. With 2,277 does administered on Monday, the total number of vaccinations within municipal limits of Aurangabad has increased to 4,96,428. It includes maximum 99,458 beneficiaries aged between 45 and 59 who have received the first dose of the vaccine, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-vaccine-crisis-affects-people-awaiting-second-dose/articleshow/84389683.cms||---

The deceased has been identified as Kavita. The accused man has been identified as Anil Arya, an event manager and his wife as Tanu. They are in their thirties. The woman lived with her son and his wife. The murder happened when they had gone out of town. The woman was reported missing on July 7. The police began investigation after receiving a complaint and found during spot inquiries that a couple living in the neighborhood was missing as well. A case of abduction was registered and a manhunt initiated. The couple was subsequently tracked down on the basis of technical surveillance. The couple broke down during interrogation and disclosed that they had taken a loan of Rs one lakh during Covid-19 pandemic but were unable to return the money. Of late, the elderly woman had started asking them to return her money and threatened to lodge a complaint. Inspired by a TV serial, the accused couple allegedly hatched a plot to eliminate the woman. They went to her house in Mohan Garden locality on the pretext of returning the money. Once there, they caught and strangled her to death. The accused couple then stuffed her body in a bag and put it in the boot of their car. They drove to the Najafgarh canal and dumped her body there. The police have recovered the body on the instance of the accused couple who have been booked for offences, including abduction, criminal conspiracy, murder and destruction of evidence. The body of the elderly woman will be handed over to the family after autopsy. While a source said the body was found hacked into three parts, the police did not confirm these reports. Last week, a relative had murdered a woman and her son in Uttam Nagar as he owed them Rs 50,000. A washerman and his associates murdered an elderly woman in Vasant Vihar for money last week as well. A family was held hostage and their house looted by robbers in Uttam Nagar recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/72-year-old-woman-killed-by-couple-unable-to-pay-off-loan/articleshow/84389792.cms||---

The bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Biren Vaishnav declined to entertain the PILs with comment, “We are here not to lower standards of education, but we want the standards to improve. So, let the repeater and private students sit in the examinations. Let them study and let them pass the exams. Don’t compare them with regular students who attend classes…either online or offline.” The petitioners contended that while Board has granted benefit of mass promotion to regular students, it is unnecessarily putting other students, repeaters and external students, at risk amid the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 5 lakh students will appear in exams to be held between July 15 and July 28. Moreover, the delay in their result would deprive them from taking admission in higher standard this year. In response, the state government submitted that elaborate and meticulous arrangements have been made with SOP prescribed to hold the exams. All students will not take the exams simultaneously. The government has earmarked 643 exam centres, made arrangements in 2,916 school buildings and designated total 28,291 blocks. This is one of the best phases in the past one year when the Covid-19 positivity rate is at its lowest, and this opportunity should not be wasted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-dismisses-pils-objecting-to-repeaters-exams/articleshow/84389708.cms||---

I was out of station at that time. The second wave’s effect on the people started increasing every day. My vacation with my sister and grandparents was confined to the house. We’d been stuck there for a month and a half when my cousin brother began complaining about having a headache. After a few days, everyone in the household tested positive except me and my other cousin. It came as a shock! A few days later, he too tested positive. I was confined to a room with an attached bathroom in the apartment to avoid exposure to the virus. While on one hand, I was happy to have tested negative, on the other, I had to stay in a room alone and do everything by myself. I was provided with food and water. Since I had all my books with me, I learned how to study and do things independently. I gained a lot of knowledge from the books during my 10-days of quarantine. I read various articles and short tales and pursued some courses that changed my way of thinking. I also wrote a few stories for my blog. By devoting time to practical studies, I managed to make good use of the time. Life in the pandemic was hard but I had a lot of worthy time too. I made sure that I continued to be optimistic and learned to look at the challenges as an adaptive way of learning new things.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Doctor’s wife was to get chunk of Borivali fake vaccine earnings||MUMBAI: Police investigation into one of the fraudulent vaccine scams at Borivali has shown the key accused had pre-decided how they would split the money they intended to earn from beneficiaries. Neeta Pataria, who ran Charkop-based Shivam Hospital with her husband Dr Shivraj Pataria, was to allegedly get the lion’s share behind every dose. Police are yet to figure out how and where did the gang dispose of vials and syringes used at various fake camps. At least 12 fraudulent camps were carried out across Mumbai Metropolitan Region and 14 people were arrested. At Aditya College in Borivali, 213 people were given the shots on June 3. The face of this fraudulent drive was Rajesh Pandey, a former marketing executive with Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital (KDAH). Pandey had told the college management the camp would be carried out under the supervision of KDAH and they would procure all necessary permissions and complete all formalities. KDAH later sacked Pandey and clarified they had nothing to do with any of the drives he was involved in. “The beneficiaries were charged Rs 1,200 per dose, which is more than the amount fixed by the authorities and therefore illegal. Neeta was to get Rs 700 for every dose, Pandey was to earn Rs 200 and the camp organiser Mahendra Singh was to make Rs 300,” a police officer said. Police probe has shown vaccine vials were allegedly provided by Dr Manish Tripathi, one of the key accused who runs a placement institute. One of Tripathi’s students, Kareem Ali, showed investigators the location where he would pick up the vials from Tripathi. Both Tripathi and Ali are in police custody. “We recorded statements of other students. It was learnt that trainee nurses from the institute would work at Shivam Hospital and were provided with identity cards,” said an investigator. In May 2021, a skill development institute had submitted a complaint against Tripathi to Vashi police. The firm had accused Tripathi of misappropriation of funds and providing confidential business information to other parties. Vashi police had summoned Tripathi for questioning but he never turned up. Subsequently, he was arrested by the Kandivli police in connection with the vaccine scam.

The setup has been established using funds from the District Planning and Development Committee. The district administration officials contested that the lack of sufficient as well as dedicated space was making it difficult for the health administration to cater to AIDS patients across various age groups and different backgrounds. After the matter was brought to the notice of district collector Ruchesh Jaywanshi, it was decided to have an exclusive facility for AIDS patients. Jaywanshi told TOI, “Ours is the first dedicated ART centre in the state. It has an exclusive setup meant for AIDS-infected patients across various age groups and for across different stages of treatment or infection.” He said that a sum of Rs 1.63 crore was readily sanctioned for the purpose by district guardian minister Varsha Gaikwad, resulting into completion of the project on a war-footing basis. “The cost of establishing exclusive setup remained low as all the available sources, including space and structure, before touching the funds allotted through DPDC,” said Jaywanshi. The first Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre in Hingoli was started at its district civil hospital in the year 2002, before taking it to all the taluka level primary health centres in 2006-07. It was in 2008-09 that the facility-integrated ICTC was started.” Jaywanshi said that though acting on the guidelines of National AIDS control organization, ART and District AIDS control and prevention unit (DAPCU) were started, they were being run from a small ward and small room, respectively. Due to lack of space, both the centres in 2018 had to be shifted to government nursing college premises. Hingoli civil surgeon Rajendra Suryawanshi said that the district has 1803 HIV positive cases, including men, widows as well as children and the dedicated facility is all set to give them required care and health-related services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/states-first-dedicated-antiretroviral-therapy-centre-in-hingoli/articleshow/84389711.cms||Mohammed Akhef

According to experts, the answer is lightning arresters catchers, which need to be installed at the top of buildings, especially at tourist places where people crowd round-the-year. On Tuesday, heads of a number of tourist hubs such as Hawa Mahal, Amber fort, Jantar Mantar and Nahargarh are demanding installation of lightning arresters from the government and writing letters to their departments. Albert Hall is the only tourist place in the city where a lightning arrester has been properly installed and is in working condition. According to the superintendent of Albert Hall museum, Rakesh Chholak, the copper plate attached from the top of the building running all the way to the ground is the key to avoid any lightning. Chholak said, “There were two incidents of lightning in 2006 and 2012 or 2013 but due to the equipment installed at the monument, a tragedy was averted.” Hawa Mahal superintendent Saroj Chanchlani wrote to the department demanding installation of lightning arresters at the top of the monument, which is in the middle of Walled City and witnesses a lot of footfall of tourists. “We need to install arresters at different areas of Amber fort as it is very big,” said Pankaj Dharendra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/city-monuments-lack-lightning-arresters/articleshow/84391957.cms||---

---||Pune||Sustainable fashion gains pace as designers in Pune tackle logistical issues||PUNE: The pandemic and the consequent lockdown has forced the fashion industry to be innovative and adapt to sustainable concepts. Tackling problems with restocking, multi-designer stores in the city are opting for trans-seasonal collections on their shelves. “Clients are not mindlessly buying luxury clothing, such as heritage saris. During the pandemic, we started helping weavers by mobilising their stock of textile. Classic items are a winner rather than trendy items,” said Rasika Wakalkar, founder, Rudraksh, a multi-designer store in Aundh. “Production was a challenge due to several restrictions. Raw material wasn’t easily available which helped us to dig into our stockroom and create textures using fabric leftovers and scraps. Also, due to shortage of labour, it became imperative to organise efficiently and work within the safety protocol. The relaxations are not going to immediately boost business. We have to focus on sales through virtual platforms and keep the product versatile and pocket friendly,” said fashion designer Kunal Tanna. Fashion designer Ridhi Mehra said that though she had to stop production because states were going into complete lockdown, international sales spiked. “The pandemic brought a lot of things into perspective and we have prepared a road map to navigate through changing market trends and adversities. This year, the artisans were in a better place compared to 2020. Our plan of action once lockdown restrictions lift is to go all out with production. We had taken up a considerable number of ready-to-ship orders for which the stocks have to be replenished.” Artisans have adapted to the new-age virtual working mode, said fashion designer Sarika Kakrania, who believes that this is the way forward. “Stores halting operations due to the lockdown left us with no outlet to sell our products, which encouraged us to create our own virtual store, where we saw substantial business pouring in. Due to the lockdown, our workshop had to be shut down, with artisans were working remotely from their homes. Though this was a big change, which pushed all of us out of our comfort zone, the artisans have adapted to the video calling and WhatsApp way of working.” Designer Eishita Puri pointed out how the pandemic brought focus on sustainability in terms of production as well as demand for sustainable products. “It may have been hard to feel inspired in these difficult times, but I am looking to our upcoming series on gender fluidity. Even though lockdown-like restrictions have eased, it is time to slow down and be more mindful of everything we do,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sustainable-fashion-gains-pace-as-designers-tackle-logistical-issues/articleshow/84391959.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Hyderabad||From a homemaker to a home baker||By Vinati ParikhWhile the lockdown was difficult in many ways, it also allowed people to have different experiences. For me too, it was no different as it gave me time to finally engage in something I have always wanted to learn – how to bake different kinds of cakes, cupcakes and brownies. Before the lockdown, my routine was set. Like all other families, my son would go to college, daughter to school and husband to office. The routine remained unchanged -- waking up, making lunch and breakfast and then ensuring that the maid completes all household chores. It was boring and monotonous as every day was much the same. Then suddenly, the pandemic hit us, resulting in a nationwide lockdown. In June 2020, a woman who started baking classes online got me excited. I enrolled myself in these classes as I thought this was the best time for me to learn baking cakes. I told myself that I can do this. Following encouragement from my husband and children, I started to learn how to bake. I attended the online sessions and learned various cupcakes and cake recipes during the lockdown. I spent an hour on the online sessions every day and tried the recipes that were subsequently relished by my family and neighbours. Soon, I started getting orders from my acquaintances. My children helped me start my own Instagram page which expanded my horizons of getting weekly orders. The lockdown was very helpful for me as it gave me an opportunity to not only learn something new but also to capitalize it.

---||Mumbai||Eknath Khadse kin land deal a fraud: Judicial panel||MUMBAI: The one-man judicial commission of Justice D S Zoting, set up in 2016 to probe allegations against then BJP revenue minister (and now NCP leader) Eknath Khadse, had passed strictures against him, saying his direction to transfer a prime piece of MIDC land in Bhosari in favour of his wife Mandakini and son-in-law Girish Chaudhari was “vitiated by fraud”. The report, which was never made public by the Devendra Fadnavis government, also called Khadse’s actions “abuse of official position”. “The issuance of direction to the authorities to return the land to the owner or to pay compensation as per the new land acquisition Act and thereafter purchase the same property by his wife and son-in-law, in my considered view, was a fraud played on policy behind the MIDC Act, 1961,” Justice Zoting observed in his 336-page report. In the wake of allegations that Khadse had misused his official position to procure prime MIDC land in Pune at a nominal price, Fadnavis had set up the commission of inquiry on June 23, 2016. Justice Zoting, a former judge of the Bombay high court, submitted his report to the government on June 28, 2016. Khadse resigned as revenue minister on June 4, 2016. In October last year, Khadse joined the NCP and he is currently under investigation by the Enforcement Directorate over the Bhosari land deal. All along, Khadse has contended that the land belonged to a private person and that the acquisition process was never complete, so there was nothing illegal in the purchase of land by his wife and son-in-law. Justice Zoting pointed out that purchase of the land, which was already vested in the state free from all encumbrances, was a move made by Khadse “to defeat law and the notified purpose of the acquisition.” “It is well settled that no legitimacy can be conferred on abuse of power to advance private purpose,” the commission stated. “Khadse has used his official/political position either for personal financial gains or for personal gains of wife and son-in-law. He breached the oath of secrecy as he used the information related to MIDC land either for his personal gain or for the benefit of his close relatives, wife and son-in-law instead of helping the original owner in getting compensation and violated the code of conduct. Under such circumstances, the land deal in the name of wife and son-in-law involves conflict of interest,” Justice Zoting observed. Once land stands vested absolutely in the government free from encumbrances under the MIDC Act, it cannot be divested. The MIDC had allotted the Bhosari land to 14 companies for establishing industries, and these industries were functioning there, so the original owners had no title to the land. Further, Justice Zoting pointed out that evidence revealed that Khadse took actions which were “derogatory, prejudicial or injurious” to the interest of the government. “Khadse’s acts of commissions and omissions would have resulted in substantial loss to the government. If the outcry of people is (sic) not published in the media,” he remarked. The judge said that from the beginning, Khadse was aware of the land deal, but took a false stand, saying he was innocent. Justice Zoting further stated that under the MIDC Act, the revenue minister has no place in the process and Khadse was not a member of MIDC. Despite this, he convened a meeting of MIDC officials on April 12, 2016 for considering transfer of the land in the name of his wife and son-in-law, without any authority, In doing so, Khadse usurped the jurisdiction of the industries department. “If the purpose is corrupt, the resultant act is bad, if the considerations foreign to the scope of power or extraneous to the statute enter the action, malafides or fraud on power vitiates the official act. Khadse has abused his official position as revenue minister by calling the meeting for facilitating transfer of land in question vested in government in favour of his wife and son-in-law, it was colourful exercise of power by Khadse,” the judge observed. Khadse was the custodian of all government land, including the land in question, which is vested in the government, but his role in respect of this land ultimately results in transaction of sale in favour of wife and son-in-law in contravention of law, which is definitely violation of public trust, the commissioner said. “The whole conduct of Khadse disentitles him to be a minister, he did acts unbecoming of a minister,” Justice Zoting said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/khadse-kin-land-deal-a-fraud-judicial-panel/articleshow/84393968.cms||---

Doosre ke baccho ko to bahut khilaya, par apne hee santaan ki parvarish ko khokla kar diya. (Children I shall return, I am not there to be with you but hope to come back one day. Have been very loving to others’ kids, but have lost out on bringing up my own children.) Such letters are the only connection to family for Nishant Agarwal, a young scientist from Brahmos Aerospace Private Limited, a part of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). He has been in solitary confinement since over two years after his arrest in a case of leaking sensitive information related to Brahmos missiles. Nishant’s words reflect his state of mind, and the hope he is clinging to. He speak of his longing to come back home and resume normal family life and have kids. He had been married for just four months when the Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) of Uttar Pradesh police arrested him. The couple has no children as yet. Nishant had hit the headlines in October 2018 when the ATS arrested him under the Official Secrets Act. It is alleged that official papers of Brahmos missile were leaked through his personal computer through malware. His was an alleged case of honey trap, where Nishant interacted with Pakistani agents posing as young girls. The agents clandestinely planted the malware and took the data. The case was transferred to Nagpur a year later, and Nishant was also shifted here. In solitary confinement since then, Nishant has not been taken out of the cell even for appearance in court. He was only produced before the court here by UP ATS after the arrest in October 2018, says his lawyer Prakash Jaiswal. The charge-sheet has been filed but the trial has not begun. The charges are yet to be framed, for which Nishant has to be brought before the court, said Jaiswal. “A bail application has been moved in high court,” he added. Nishant’s letter written in April shows he has not lost hope, and is preparing for a strong defence. The letter had a news clipping attached, on Nambi Narayan case of 1994, where an ISRO scientist’s arrest in a similar case was found illegal. His contention is that the ATS case is based on the assumption or likelihood of data being leaked. There no strong technical evidence to prove it, he says. Having gone through the charge-sheet, he also wrote down points to be discussed with the lawyer, including four case laws. Nishant notes that the FIR shows ATS intelligence report depended on the Facebook profile of Neha Sharma and Pooja Ranjan (alleged Pakistani agents posing as Indian girls). No technical data of any leakage was given to them by any forensic lab or informer. “On searching my laptop they found documents and they thought these may have been leaked by malware. The ATS thought everything happened in chat but actually could not show any chat history,” he says. “Their (Neha and Pooja) email and Facebook IDs show Indian domain names so how would I know that they are from Pakistan,” he writes. He further says the Pooja’s IP address was of Romania and not Pakistan. The letter also refutes ATS claims in FIR and charge sheet that Nishant asked to be forgiven for what he had done. “I did not say sorry to anyone,” he writes. “How would I know where the 17-18 secret files are kept in lakhs of documents unless given access by a senior. The ATS did not find any external device signature belonging to me. There was no biometric scan or time signature either. It is also possible that someone else copied these documents using their external device and moved in my laptop,” the letter says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fallen-missile-engineer-rises-from-despair-to-hope-in-letters-to-family/articleshow/84389785.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Kolkata||Price-dip hope in West Bengal after truck norm eases||KOLKATA: Bengal government finally permitted trucks to carry up to 25% more weight than before. The decision will have implications on commodity prices, road traffic and safety, besides truck sales, freight rates and government revenue, said transport department officer. On Monday, Bengal’s transport minister Firhad Hakim held meeting with truck operators and conveyed to them the Chief minister’s decision on the revised axle weight, much to the joy of truck operators. “At the same time, we are adopting zero tolerance to overloading,” said Hakim. He said that transport department will maintain a stricter vigil at major loading points. The ministry of road transport and highways (MORTH) revised the axle load in July 2018. However, Bengal government did not revise it. “It led to a lot of complication. When we are sending 9 tonnes of goods to Maharashtra, from there we are receiving 12 tonnes, which is often being confiscated by the Bengal government as an over-loading case,” said Sajal Ghosh, general secretary, Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators’ Associations. Under new norms — which the government claims will reduce logistics costs by 2%— gross vehicle weight (GVW) for a two-axle truck (two wheels in front axle and four wheels in the rear) has been raised from 16.2 tonnes to 18.5 tonnes; for three-axle trucks from 25 tonnes to 28.5 tonnes; and for five-axle trucks from 37 tonnes to 43.5 tonnes. Transport department officers said the move will help reduce transportation cost and consequently, commodity prices. Overloading is very rampant and the move will help stop it. Transport operators said the move will also help bring down corruption and overloading. “We will now enforce overloading rules very strictly. We will not allow any overloaded vehicle to move till excess load is removed,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/price-dip-hope-in-state-after-truck-norm-eases/articleshow/84389832.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

According to the officials, the projects include 17 new Road under Bridges (RuBs) and Road over Bridges (RoBs) in the city out of which 13 are located in the northern part of the city, while three are in southern part and two are in central part. “These projects have been proposed at selected Manned Level Crossings (MLC) so that we will be able to completely remove MLCs in GHMC limits. These MLCs will be converted into RuBs and RoBs in a phased manner but in coordination with SCR,” a GHMC official said. Meanwhile, in a similar project to enhance safety at level crossing gate, the Hyderabad division of SCR has been successful in elimination of Level Crossing 97E located between Gadwal - Sriramnagar stations in Secunderabad - Dhone section. According to SCR, in the current financial year, Hyderabad division has eliminated two manned level crossing gates so far and is progressing well to strengthen safety across its jurisdiction. SCR general manager Gajanan Mallya said, “The LC gate located between Gadwal - Sriramnagar stations is in the close proximity of Krishna River and posed many challenges which were tackled in an effective manner by SCR. The construction of RUB was executed with meticulous planning and will definitely enhance the safety at the level crossing gate.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/17-bridges-proposed-to-ease-congestion/articleshow/84389825.cms||---

---||Delhi||Quiet flows traffic below Minto Bridge even as DTC’s teams stay on high alert||New Delhi: For most Delhiites, the sight of a Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) bus submerged in rainwater under Minto Bridge is an enduring image of the arrival of monsoon and the chaos it brings in its wake to the capital’s streets. This monsoon, however, DTC seems to be armed with an action plan to end this unsavoury tradition for good. After a long wait, the monsoon finally hit the capital on Tuesday, but the rainfall didn’t lead to any major waterlogging under Minto Bridge. Even if rainwater does somehow accumulate under the bridge despite the efforts, DTC has deployed checking teams this time on both sides of not only Minto Bridge but also other locations to divert the buses immediately whenever flooding of these underpasses is noticed. Apart from Minto Bridge, the other locations that face problem of waterlogging are Pul Prahladpur underpass in south Delhi near the Badarpur border and the Zakhira underpass near Sarai Rohilla in west Delhi. DTC is also keeping an eye on the Moolchand underpass and Vikas Marg. TOI was the first to report that this monsoon, DTC has an action plan ready and will deploy two teams on both sides, which will send alerts when the rainwater starts to rise at these locations, so that all DTC buses on that route are diverted to pre-determined alternate routes. In a recent statement, DTC had said it had been observed that during rainy reason due to waterlogging under Minto Road Bridge, Pul Prahladpur and Zakhira underpasses, DTC buses get stranded every year, which is dangerous to both passengers and the vehicle. DTC had said it had been decided that buses would be diverted in case of such waterlogging in these three underpasses or any other severely flooded location. “All regional managers, unit officers and teams deployed at locations that prone to get waterlogged were asked to divert buses to alternative routes when needed. Bus marshals were also directed to stop bus drivers from driving into waterlogged areas and inform headquarters immediately,” an official said. “While all our teams and personnel were on alert, there was no report of the requirement to divert buses. There were no incident of buses getting stranded either,” he added. Waterlogging below the colonial era bridge has been happening almost since the bridge and the road below it came up after the creation of New Delhi. From vintage public transport buses to the latest low-floor ones, the sight of one bus getting submerged in accumulated rainwater has become an annual occurrence during the monsoon. Last July, a 56-year-old man died allegedly due to drowning in water accumulated under Minto Bridge after a downpour. Delhi government then ordered many measures, ranging from engineering solutions to barricading the roads leading to the bridge if the water level rises to a certain level and filing an FIR against anyone who tries to violate the restriction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/quiet-flows-traffic-below-minto-bridge-even-as-dtcs-teams-stay-on-high-alert/articleshow/84389878.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Delhi||Despite much-delayed onset, experts expect normal monsoon in Delhi||NEW DELHI: After the delayed onset of monsoon over Delhi on Tuesday, late by almost a month from the earliest prediction of June 15, India Meteorological Department said the rainy season will be ‘normal’ or ‘below normal’ in the capital. From June 1 to July 13, the capital recorded a rain deficit of 65% of the normal for the period. However, Met officials said even though the monsoon arrived late in the city, that deficit was likely to be covered during the season. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and the head of Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “The monsoon period in Delhi is expected to remain normal or below normal. The main rain activity is usually recorded from July 10 to the last week of August. Heavy spells of rain mostly happen in August, but the capital may experience one or two spells of heavy rains this month too.” He cautioned that this could vary for a longer duration, depending on the meteorological conditions prevailing at a particular time. R K Jenamani, scientist at India Meteorological Department, informed, “There is a possibility of very light rain or drizzle on July 15 and 16.” According to IMD, rainfall between 15.6mm and 64.4mm is described as ‘moderate’, while ‘heavy rainfall’ is recorded when the precipitation measures from 64.5mm to 115.5mm. In June, IMD had forecast a slightly ‘below normal’ monsoon for Delhi this year. While the normal mark for the June-September period is 648.9mm of rain, Delhi received 576.6mm last year and only 404.3mm in 2019. Delhi has received ‘above normal’ rainfall only three times in the last 11 years, according to IMD data from 2010 till 2020. This year, the monsoon rains reached the capital after a delay of 16 days from the normal date of June 27. Last year, it arrived two days early, but the monsoons withdrew from Delhi on September 30 with an overall 20% deficit. The normal date of withdrawal of the monsoons from the city used to be September 21 until its revision to September 25 last year. Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency, expected a late withdrawal of monsoon from Delhi. “The trough, which is the main driving factor of monsoon, is presently over the central part of the country, passing from Gujarat to west-central Bay of Bengal across Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and north Andhra Pradesh. The low pressure area which is over Gujarat and west-central Bay of Bengal may be weakened by July 15 or 16. The rainfall may be moderate to heavy in many parts of northern regions, including Delhi, from July 17 to 19,” said Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather. Palawat added, “Some recovery in rain is expected by July-end but the intensity of rains is predicted to be higher in August and September. Evolving La Nina conditions are likely to commence between August and September, leading to enhanced rainfall activity. There are chances of a late withdrawal of the monsoons this year. The overall rainfall is likely to be near normal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/good-things-come-to-those-who-wait-/articleshow/84389798.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

As both became victims of the Amber tragedy, the family is devastated and heartbroken. Bodies of Amit and Shivani were consigned to flames in Amritsar on Tuesday. TOI on Tuesday spoke to the family living at Vrindavan Vihar 2, near Bagadon ka Bad in Sanganer area to know what they went through when they received the tragic news of the deaths of their relatives. “Firstly, I am very upset with the news reports that claimed Shivani was to be getting married and also that both Amit and Shivani had come to Jaipur on a bike. My mother Lavanya Lata Sharma (68) had a fracture in her thigh last year and since then she is bed-ridden. Both Amit and Shivani were keen to meet her as Covid cases have dipped. They took a train from Amritsar on July 8 and reached here on July 9 morning,” Rakesh Sharma, a cousin of Amit and Shivani told TOI. Talking about the tragic day, Rakesh said, “Just for a change, they wanted to visit the Walled City and my cousin was a bike enthusiast and he requested if he can take my bullet bike. They left from home at 1.30pm and explored Jal Mahal, Hawa Mahal, Nahargarh before reaching Amber.” “In the evening, while torrential rainfall started in Jaipur we were worried when we got a call from Amit wherein he informed us about the lightning and the death of Shivani. Later, when my wife called them after some minutes, somebody else picked up Amit’s phone and informed us that he was no more,” Rakesh added. Rakesh, along with some neighbours, visited Amber watch tower where by seeing some pictures clicked on the mobile, they identified Amit and Shivani. “We have had sleepless nights. We got their bodies on Monday which reached Amritsar’s Bhalla colony on Tuesday morning. We are receiving calls and making calls but still, it is hard to believe that both have left us,” said Rakesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/maternal-family-devastated-as-siblings-cremated-in-amritsar/articleshow/84392000.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Pune||Catchments get good rain, dam levels catering to Pune up after 10 days||PUNE: Water levels in the five dams catering to the city have increased after almost 10 days with their catchments receiving good spells of rain since Monday. The collective stock in the four dams of the Khadakwasla irrigation circle increased to 30% on Tuesday. On the other hand, the storage in Bhama Askhed was 42%. The fortnight’s break in rainfall had reduced the inflow of rainwater into the reservoirs. This had resulted in a slight drop in water storages. Around a fortnight ago, the collective stock in the four reservoirs was around 8.5 TMC. An irrigation department official said the catchments had hardly received any heavy spells of rainfall in the past 10 days. “The rainfall finally revived in the catchments from Monday after a long gap. Temghar received 70mm of rainfall till Tuesday morning, while Panshet and Varasgaon each got around 50mm” the official said. “The storage is expected to increase further if the catchments continue to receive similar spells of rain in the next few days,” the official added. On Tuesday, the collective stock in the four dams in the Khadakwasla circle was 8.8 TMC. This storage was slightly higher than last year’s 8.39 TMC, the official said, adding that the collective live water storage capacity of the four dams is 29.15 TMC. “We are monitoring water levels in all the reservoirs. Most dams have received good spells of rainfall in the last two days. Of the 25 major reservoirs in the Bhima basin, the storage in two dams is above 50%. The storage in four dams has increased to almost the half-way mark,” the official added. The existing water stock in the dams in the Khadakwasla irrigation circle has been reserved to meet the drinking water requirements, the official said. The irrigation department has no plans to initiate release of water into the canal in the immediate future. The irrigation department’s data revealed that Pavana, which supplies water to Pimpri Chinchwad, also recorded good spells of rainfall. The dam received over 50mm of rainfall in the 24 hours ending on Tuesday morning, another official in the irrigation department said. The dam has so far received 625mm rainfall since June 1. This was third highest in the Bhima basin, after Temghar, which received 667mm of rainfall, and Mulshi, which got 634mm of rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/catchments-get-good-rain-dam-levels-up-after-10-days/articleshow/84389835.cms||Sarang Dastane

The woman, who is critical, is undergoing treatment at the intensive care unit of a private hospital in Agra after she was referred by the Firozabad district hospital. Three people booked in the case. Victim was identified as Reena. Her family alleged that Reena’s husband, Ashu Kushwah, blamed her for failing to conceive even after 11 years of their marriage. The fact was that his sperm count was low but he and his family members tortured Reena for not conceiving, they claimed. Ashu also used to put pressure on his wife for dowry. Reena’s family had given Ashu Rs 4 lakh on the promise that he would treat Reena properly, they said. However, her harassment did not stop. Ashok Kumar, Reena’s brother said, “My sister was beaten up and set ablaze by her husband and father-in-law on Sunday evening. Her neighbours informed us about her condition. We took her to the district hospital in critical condition. Doctors there referred her to Agra. With much difficulty, she recorded her statement.” Based on a complaint filed by the victim’s father, an FIR was registered against Ashu Kushwah, his father, Pramod Kumar, and sister-in-law, Sookhi, at the Sirsaganj police station on Tuesday. Girish Chand Gautam, Sirsaganj police station house officer, said, “An FIR has been registered under IPC section 307 (attempt to murder) against Ashu Kushwah, his father and sister-in-law. Primary investigation revealed that Reena had a troubled relationship with her husband and in-laws for several years. The incident was triggered by a fight over Reena talking on the phone with a relative. The Kushwahs are claiming that she tried to commit suicide. The matter is being investigated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/woman-set-ablaze-by-husband-father-in-law-for-not-conceiving/articleshow/84387369.cms||Deepak Lavania

Police registered a case of murder and trespassing against the man. A complaint was registered by Ajay Panchal, 34, who stated that he met Vanraj Sindha, a resident of CTM who worked at a plastic factory in Mahadev Estate. Panchal said he asked Sindha to help him get work for his wife, Bhumika. Vanraj then frequently visited his residence and met his wife about her work. About 30 days ago, he awoke at night and saw his wife Bhumika with Sindha. He told his in-laws about Bhumika’s transgression and they intervened, and forbid her from association with Sindha. Panchal also told Sindha to stay away from his wife, and for 30 days Sindha did not come to his home. On Tuesday morning, when Panchal and his mother had gone to a temple, he received a call from his neighbour informing him that Sindha was inside his house and had locked it. Panchal stated that when he got home, he found his wife in a pool of blood and Sindha also lying there in blood. He stated that the two were taken to a hospital where Bhumika was declared brought dead and Sindha died later during treatment. The complainant stated his grandmother told him that Sindha had a heated argument with Bhumika, after which he stabbed her several times.

On Tuesday, he bombarded former CM Parkash Singh Badal, Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal, and former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal with a tweet titled ‘Lest You Forget’ and tagged Sukhbir and Harsimrat. The tweet was an old video of three Badals, of their praising the farm ordinances brought by Narendra Modi’ central government. The camera caputres Sukhbir as saying that the SAD welcomes the bills and the MSP wasn’t an issue. Harsimrat is shown claiming that the Congress and its B team were misleading the farmers. The senior Badal is also all praise for the ordinances in the video and is recorded as saying that is not possible that MSP will be stopped. Sukhbir retorted by uploading an old video of Amarinder before 2017 when he had promised to waive all farm loans, whether taken from banks, co-operatives, or commission agents. The Captain is heard saying that the Punjab government will repay these loans. Sukbir also titled the tweet ‘Lest You Forget’ and tagged Captain Amarinder Singh. On July 9, Sukhbir had stated that if the SAD-BSP combine gained power in 2022, its first task will be to give jobs, , besides medical insurance and free education till postgraduation, to the close relatives of the farmers who had died during the ongoing struggle. Amarinder said the Congress had done it already.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/twitter-wars-cm-badals-slug-it-out-over-farmers/articleshow/84392057.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Delhi||Guard stays up: Cases down in Delhi, testing isn’t||NEW DELHI: The number of fresh Covid-19 cases being reported every day and the positivity rate are now at a 15-month low in Delhi but the number of Covid tests is not. With a focus on preparing for the likely next wave, there has been no let-up in the number of daily tests. The district authorities are carrying out between 75,000 and 80,000 tests every day even as the number of fresh Covid-19 cases has remained mostly below 100 and the positivity rate is at an all-time low. This month has seen 73,134.4 Covid tests on average every day till July 12, which is higher than the average of 72,945.6 in June. Although the percentage of RT-PCR tests, considered a gold standard in the diagnosis of Covid-19, was 71.42% last month, it is still as high as 70.12% this month despite the drastic fall in the number of fresh cases, fatalities and active cases. In November, when Delhi had witnessed a peak in both fresh and active Covid cases — which were the all-time high till April this year — 16.2 lakh tests were carried out, with an average of 54,022 a day. Out of this, slightly more than six lakh or 37.36% were the more reliable RT-PCR tests and more than 10 lakh were Rapid Antigen Tests. In December, nearly 24 lakh tests were carried out with the share of RT-PCR tests being 50.24%, which increased to 57.65% even as the total number of tests dipped to 20.4 lakh in January this year. February, which saw a huge dip in the number of fresh cases, also saw the average number of tests carried out every day dip further to 58,403.3 but the share of RT-PCR tests went up to 64.81%. When Covid-19 cases started to rise in March, the average number of tests also went up to 72,042, with 64.29% of these being RT-PCR tests. April saw the peak of the city’s current wave and, as a result, the average number of tests went up to 85,927.7, with the share of RT-PCR tests also increasing to 66.02%. As the number of cases started dipping from mid-May following the lockdown, the number of random Rapid Antigen Tests, usually carried out in public places, also came down. The average number of daily tests came down to 69,081.5 in May, but the share of RT-PCR tests peaked at 75.17%. District officials said that while they were already following an aggressive testing strategy, they had made surveillance in and near containment zones even more stringent. “Testing in containment and buffer zones have gone up and we are targeting more people,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/guard-stays-up-cases-down-testing-isnt/articleshow/84389849.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The city reported its first Covid patient on April 6 last year, but the cases started increasing from June 2020. The economic activities were badly-affected due to the pandemic and the NMC also had to deploy its staff from the property tax department for Covid-related services across the city. According to an NMC official, the online payment of property tax was only 5% before the pandemic, but now has increased to over 20%.  “The civic body collected Rs 120 crore towards property tax during the last financial year out of which Rs 30 crore were collected via online payments,” an official said. The NMC has also introduced upto 5% rebate in property tax to those who pay their annual property tax in one go. As per the scheme, those who paid their annual property tax by May 31 got a 5% rebate. The concession was reducded to 3% for payments made before June 30 and those clearing their dues by July 31 will get a 2% rebate. Due to this system, the property tax collection of NMC has increased by 20% to Rs 37 crore till July 12 this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-4-time-rise-in-online-payment-of-property-tax/articleshow/84389831.cms||Tushar Pawar

On Monday, the complainant S Sony along with her sister Renuka, went to Shekhar, manager of a pub, and sought the CCTV footage of the pub as some men had misbehaved with her. “Renuka told the pub manager that when she was dancing with her husband, some other men who were dancing had misbehaved with her. She wanted the CCTV footage to identify the offenders,” Punjagutta inspector M Niranjan Reddy said. The pub manager suggested that Renuka should meet the proprietor, Murali Krishna. Renuka and Sony met Murali Krishna and told him about the incident. “Murali Krishna asked Renuka not to go to the police as it would tarnish his pub’s image. When Renuka refused, Murali Krishna abused the two women,” the inspector said.

---||Agra||Agra: 13 juvenile offenders walk free after 20 years in jail, shaken but hopeful||AGRA: Thirteen convicts, who spent between 14 and 20 years each in prison despite being juveniles at the time of committing the crimes, walked out of prison on Monday night in Uttar Pradesh, several days after the Supreme Court granted “interim bail” to them. Some of the convicts TOI spoke to bemoaned the “loss of their childhood”, but said they were looking forward to rebuilding their lives. Others were uncertain if they would be able to leave their “tainted past” behind. Aadil Khan, who was 16 when he was sent to prison along with his father Dilshad in 2000, said he had not taken the defence of juvenility as he was not aware of the juvenile delinquency laws. “I dropped out of school early and didn’t know much. In jail, there were hardened criminals all around. I was young and it was mental torture for me to spend so many years alongside them. But the presence of my father in jail protected me somewhat,” he told TOI. Khan, now 37, said he is looking forward to starting the next chapter of his life. “I have lost my best years…I often dreamt of what I would do if I got out of jail. Perhaps, I will take up farming…” he said. Another 16-year-old inmate at Agra Central Jail who was granted bail was Waliuddin (who only uses his first name). Lodged in prison since August 2009, Waliuddin walked out on Monday, clutching a treasured photo of his mother. “It was her photo that gave me the strength to face my circumstances. My family is poor and they were able to visit me only a few times in all these years,” said Waliuddin, now 28. “I want to put the past behind me and begin afresh,” he added. Teju Singh, 40, has already learned some stitching work in prison. “I have to live with a tainted name, but I’m hoping to earn a decent living with my new skill,” said Singh, who was booked in a murder case in 1998 when he was 16. He was in prison since 2009. For Shahidul Hassan, a “new beginning” means being a father to his two children, whom he has seen after 12 years. “I had a 2-year-old son and a 3-month-old daughter when I was put behind bars,” said Hassan, a resident of Bulandshahr. Hassan was booked for murder in 1999 when he was 15. He was bailed out in 2001 but convicted and sent to jail a few years later in 2009. Hassan was jailed along with his brother Shahid, who was only 13 at the time of committing the crime. “Without legal aid, I would have spent the rest of my life in jail,” said Shahid. The 13 convicts had recently moved the apex court, stating that they were being kept in jail in violation of the Juvenile Justice Act 2000. According to the Act, juvenile offenders must be tried separately. While 12 convicts were lodged in Agra Central Jail, one of them was recently shifted to Bareilly Jail. Advocate Rishi Malhotra, who is representing the convicts, told TOI that since all of them had spent more than three years in jail – the maximum punishment under Juvenile Justice Act 2000 – their custody won’t be required again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/13-juvenile-offenders-walk-free-after-20-yrs-in-jail-shaken-but-hopeful/articleshow/84387479.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

As per official data, around 58% of the reserved seats have witnessed admissions in Aurangabad district, whereas around 1,500 seats remained unclaimed till Tuesday evening. The progress of admissions under the RTE Act has evoked mixed reactions with educational activists dubbing it as unsatisfactory, while authorities concerned calling it in keeping with the annual trend. “The pandemic has had an adverse impact on admission process this year too like the last year. Many deserving beneficiaries failed to take benefit of the RTE Act due to different hurdles. Even though the academic activities for the academic year 2021-22 have already started, over 40% of seats are still vacant,” educational activist Prashant Sathe said. Sangita Sawale, the extension officer with Aurangabad zilla parishad, said the deadline for seeking admission has already been extended to July 23. “We hope the remaining parents also seek admissions by following due procedure. The overall progress of admission is in keeping with the past, which every year sees some seats lying vacant,” she said. At the state level, a total of 49,476 beneficiaries have secured admission under the RTE Act 2009 as against the total intake capacity of 96,684 seats across 9,432 schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/just-58-rte-seats-claimed-in-aurangabad/articleshow/84389873.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Here’s how Hyderabadis are thriving in new normal||Creating new routines and adopting newer lifestyle, people remaining a step ahead of the pandemic Sanitisers replace cosmetics in handbagBy Rekha Rao, academicianMy new normal is seen in my handbag contents. Due to the pandemic, I don’t have to carry cosmetics such as lipstick, compact or primer in my handbag. Instead, it contains sanitizer, sanitizer wipes, disinfectants for surfaces, fabric sanitizer etc. A variety of sanitizers have replaced my branded cosmetics which have now lost their shelf life. My dressing table is well stocked with these new entrants that too in different fragrances. My favourite fragrance is orange. I am called to address public events. I carry extra masks for those who don’t have proper masks or are not wearing one. Make-up is an integral part of my job. Now my handbag is less of cosmetics and more of utility. My mask has become my second skin as I match it with my dresses. Initially, this new normal was tough to adopt. But now, I have embraced it. Maintaining work-life balanceBy Jitesh Mathur, corporate employeeWorking from home was one major change that the pandemic triggered in the lives of corporate employees. It has its own pros and cons. As more and more companies are adopting 'hybrid model' or 'remote working' options, this has already become a new normal for many employees. On one hand, it gives employees an opportunity to spend more time with their families while slashing their travel time to office. On the other hand, it also has resulted in employees spending more time on desks with the boundaries between work and family life fading fast. This really took a toll on my mental health. As I realised it, I started engaging myself in reading and writing. I subscribed to more newspapers and books and started writing more blogs and letters since the lockdown confined us in our homes. Seeing them get published gave me happiness and has a soothing effect. Now, in the post Covid-19 world, this will help me calm myself down in stressful situations at work or at home. So, we should adopt one good habit based on choices or hobbies to keep ourselves mentally relaxed in the post Covid-19 world. Engaging students in active learning assignmentsBy D Kanthi Sudha, assistant professorLife during the pandemic has brought in challenges which must be embraced, mainly due to lack of choice. Belonging to the teaching fraternity, I derive my energy from students and their reaction to my teaching. It gives me huge satisfaction when I handle a class which is interactive. Staring at a blank screen, where students don't even switch on their cameras under the pretext of bandwidth, was really disheartening. In this context, it did seem to me that faculty and students are at loggerheads in an online environment. Antennas and wave propagation was the course dealt by me for third year electronics and communication engineering students and I created this assignment called “scrap twin” where I asked my students to design a replica of various types of antennas, from the scrap material they had at home. They also had to work out on the design equations of the chosen antenna, for a frequency. I was skeptical about the task assigned but they proved me wrong by giving an overwhelming response. This experience motivated me to create active learning assignments hereon in courses I teach, for spearheading into the new normal with conviction and self-satisfaction. Living in caution, not in fearAnand Menon, retired bankerLast year, this time the world in general and the states were grimacing in the wake of the pandemic. Every activity of the average human being was restricted. The situation was bad with a lot of restrictions in place. Masks, sanitizers and social distancing were in vogue. The trend continued and to this day, albeit with little relaxation, it has been a cautious approach. In the context of a better living, the parameters set can be lauded. The new generation children will be up to the task and start growing up in a hygienic environment. As a senior citizen, I waded through the pandemic quite comfortably. There have been no major ailments, no discomfort to highlight. I have taken my Covid-19 vaccine, indulge in regular exercises and follow a disciplined diet. By getting the best out of the better, living by the rules and not by the sword. Having been confined to the room, creativity has been enhanced. One should now share best practices and keep the environment clean and healthy. Indulging in community lifeN Ashok Kumar, retired university professorLike others, I too started stepping into a new normal after the city was unlocked. I changed my daily schedule, giving top priority to my social responsibilities besides academic work. As a retired university teacher, I have a knack for reading and writing. I am 72 but active. At the same time, I am very conscious about post-Covid-19 life too. I do not want to take any chances. To keep myself engaged, I embraced community activities which I left during the lockdown period with a heavy heart. Now, I am happy to participate in various activities in my residential colony. I started going to the club again which is a rendezvous for all of us in the colony to meet and share our experiences. No more lolling out in an easy chair. Playing indoor games in the evenings is my regular activity to keep my physique healthy. My mini library is my best friend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/heres-how-hyderabadis-are-thriving-in-new-normal/articleshow/84392088.cms||---
---||Kolkata||200 trees to keep Covid warriors’ memory alive||KOLKATA: A park dedicated to the memory of Covid warriors who fought valiantly before succumbing to the novel coronavirus was inaugurated on Sunday. Two-hundred big trees have been planted, each with plaques, carrying the names of doctors, nurses, policemen, journalists and newspaper vendors who died in the line of duty over the past year-and-a-half. Located 6km off EM Bypass at Bamanghata off Basanti Expressway, the green zone was inaugurated by Sreedip Roy, a doctor and a Covid warrior. Nalban-II is a southern extension of Nalban I, next to the Salt Lake Bypass. “The trees have been dedicated to Covid warriors whose significant contribution to the battle against the pandemic ought to be honoured,” said Prabir Karmakar, a clerk at Kolkata Police headquarters Lalbazar. Prabir, along with his wife Suparna Karmakar, convinced the authorities of Nalban-II near Kolkata Leather Complex to earmark 6,000 sq ft as a tribute to the deceased. “We were moved by the proposal. We have never come across a concept of a park in the memory of the deceased. Covid warriors were common people who became extraordinary by dint of their work during the pandemic,” said Samir Chakraborty, in charge of the park section of Nalban-II that is managed by the fisheries cooperative. Among the trees planted are flower- and fruit-bearing varieties. “Visitors can watch birds as they walk around the trees to remember the brave souls who continued their work despite the threat,” said Suparna. IMA secretary Shantanu Sen lauded the initiative. “It is a unique idea at a time when doctors and other frontline health workers are facing the ire of patients’ families . The park acknowledges the warriors’ battle against all odds,” he said. Kolkata Police DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha said, “On one hand, it adds to the greenery and on the other, it is a beautiful way to recognise the contribution of the people in the line of duty,” he said. Bhangar BDO Dipyaman Mazumdar said he was glad the memorial was coming up in his area. “The park will give solace to the bereaved families by keeping their memories alive.” Sumitra Mazumdar, granddaughter of diabetologist Utpal Sengupta who died in the pandemic, said, “ My grandfather treated patients even at the peak of Covid. I felt bitter and wondered if anyone would even recognise his sacrifice. This park has taken away the bitterness.” Samaresh Biswas, brother of Abhiruk Biswas, a police officer who also died due to Covid, said, “We are yet to overcome the grief of losing my brother who was so full of life. But through this park, I think, he will be remembered forever.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/200-trees-to-keep-covid-warriors-memory-alive/articleshow/84389882.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Chandigarh||Funds had nothing to do with Punjab polls, says CM Capt Amarinder Singh||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, on Tuesday, said Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) were lying blatantly and that funds provided to the Congress had nothing to do with Punjab elections or the controversial power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed by the Akalis. Political donations by certain power companies were made not to Punjab Congress but to the All India Congress Committee (AICC) back in 2009 and 2014, with no connection whatsoever with the incumbent government in the state, said Amarinder. He also slammed SAD and the AAP for “spreading lies in a desperate attempt to mislead people ahead of the 2022 state assembly elections.” The PPAs in question had been signed by the erstwhile SAD-BJP government and were legally binding, so the Congress government could not rescind these without heavy penalties on the cash-strapped state, said Amarinder. He said his government was exploring legal recourse to neutralise the ill-effects of PPAs without further burdening the state exchequer, which he alleged, the Akalis and their BJP allies had milked dry to fill their own pockets. As per media reports, the Akalis, led by the Badals, had taken more than Rs 100 crore in political funds and declared just Rs 13 crore, pocketing the rest. As for AAP, donations taken by Arvind Kejriwal’s party during the 2014 elections were already under the scanner of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) as, unlike the funds donated to AICC by private power companies, these were neither accounted for nor declared, he alleged. He also mentioned recent reports saying that the ED had registered a case pertaining to four cheques amounting to Rs 50 lakh, allegedly given to AAP during the 2014 Delhi assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cm-funds-had-nothing-to-do-with-pb-polls/articleshow/84392129.cms||---

The police had arrested Yemul guruji on Saturday in a domestic violence case. “The suspect was produced before a city court on Tuesday and the court remanded him in the magisterial custody. In the evening, he was shifted to the Yerawad central prison,” inspector Rajkumar Waghchure of the Chatushrungi police said. Waghchaure added, “We have invoked the provisions of the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act against Yemul guruji and others in the case”. According to the police, the suspect is well known among the political and film personalities and many of them often pay visits to him. “A woman (27) of Aundh, belonging to an affluent family had lodged a complaint of domestic violence against her husband and in-laws of mental and physical torture on the directions of Yemul guruji. Husband and in-laws of te woman own business in Aundh area,” the police said. “The complainant would’ve ‘apparently’ brought bad luck to the family and thus Yemul guruji had asked the woman’s husband and inlaws to torture her,” the police added. The Police have registered the case under sections 498a (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 392 (robbery), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 325 (grievous hurt), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (Cheating), 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (Common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-invoke-provisions-of-black-magic-act-against-yemul-guruji/articleshow/84389907.cms||---

As the land-owning agencies have prepared documents for notifying 368 waterbodies, the technical committee will review their plans and assist them in technical matters. A senior official of the environment department said, “We had received just 23 brief documents in July last year, but the number of documents prepared rose to 368 in July this year. The newly constituted body will review the brief documents, management plans of wetlands prepared by the departments concerned and advise on any technical matter referred by the Wetland Authority of Delhi.”The official added that the process of notification of wetlands will begin after the committee reviews the brief documents of 368 waterbodies.The chief economist at World Resources Institute at Delhi, Madhu Verma, is the chairperson of the committee. The other committee members are from Teri University, Centre for Science and Environment, Water Technology Centre from Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Wetlands International South Asia, member of Prime Minister’s Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (PM-STIAC) and member secretary of Wetland Authority of Delhi. Earlier, TOI had reported that Delhi currently does not have a single notified waterbody. The Union ministry of environment and forest and climate change came out with guidelines last year for implementing Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017. The guidelines stated that for each wetland proposed to be notified, a ‘brief document’ has to be prepared with information like demarcation of wetland boundary for enforcement of regulation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/panel-for-conservation-of-waterbodies-in-city/articleshow/84389902.cms||---

Had a decision been taken earlier, it could have saved her from hospitalization.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ve-antibodies-result-if-fake-vax-victims-had-got-infected-before/articleshow/84392133.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Mother’s wish fulfilled as boy’s body retrieved from well after 21 days||JAIPUR: The body of 15-year-old Narendra Nayak, who got buried in a well at a village in Sojat City, Pali district, on June 21 was finally recovered on Tuesday. The body was spotted late on Monday after 21 days of a non-stop rescue mission involving the engineering wing of the Army. The body was completely decomposed due to the pressure of mud, stones and water. It took six hours for the rescue team to look for most of the major parts of the body. The operation was continued all these days to fulfil the minor boy’s mother’s wish to see his face for the last time. His body, however, was completely decomposed and the rescuers had a hard time retrieving his body at 180-feet below the well. Nayak, while working at 40-feet below the well on June 22, buried after the wall collapsed led to the start of the state’s biggest rescue operation in terms of the number of days. His body was found almost touching the base of the 185-feet well. “Luckily, the body was recovered by the trained rescuers at around noon. It took a lot of time for the rescuers to carefully dig the area around the body with light tools and lift it safely. While retrieving the body, two rescuers complaint of exhaustion due to smell from the body and were given immediate medical aid,” said Kalu Ram Rawat, SP Pali. Till the last report came, the post-mortem of the body was carried out was in a process of handing over to the family members. Indira Devi, the mother of the deceased, was present when the body was retrieved by the mission team. The Nayak family thanked the Army and local administration for their tireless effort in retrieving the body even after 21 days of the incident. The moment it was spotted the team under the main supervision of the engineering core observed a minute-long silence. The mission remained halted for the entire Monday night since the depth was huge and rescuers wanted to wait for sunlight to avoid any danger. The rescuers spotted a clenched fist on Monday at 8pm. It took another two hours to confirm the development since many times the rescuers confused spotting lizards buried in the sand as the body. “The rescuers reached the body by 3am but they figure out that body has decomposed due to continuous buried in mud and water. The high humidity added with the smell of the body and fear of other gases below 180-feet halted the operation till in the morning,” said an engineer overseeing the operation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/moms-wish-fulfilled-as-boys-body-retrieved-from-well-after-21-days/articleshow/84392106.cms||---
---||Pune||PCMC to revive mechanised road sweeping||Pimpri Chinchwad: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has decided to revive mechanised road sweeping for the 900km road network in its north and south zones. A proposal in this regard will be tabled at next week’s general body meeting. Mechanised sweeping was first introduced in PCMC limits in 2015. Anil Roy, medical officer of health, said the mechanised sweeping was earlier implemented from 2015 to 2017 with the help of two private firms. The contract was extended for four months, after which it lapsed. “Now that the proposal is with the general body, we are expecting it to go through, after which the tendering and contract process will begin. We expect the process to be completed in three or four months,” said Roy. Roy said as per Union government guidelines, every city with more than 10 lakh population must opt for mechanised sweeping. “It is dangerous for the staff to clean the wide roads manually. This can be resolved with machine sweeping,” he said. Municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI, “We want to go ahead with mechanised sweeping proposal as it is the need of the hour.” Earlier this year, the draft proposal was submitted to the then commissioner Shravan Hardikar, but after his transfer in February, the proposal was put on the backburner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-to-revive-mechanised-road-sweeping/articleshow/84392134.cms||---
---||Kolkata||STF questions locals about JMB members, linkmen||Kolkata: Several central agencies are likely to question the three arrested members of terror outfit Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) after it emerged that one of the accused, Naziur Rahaman Pavel (22) alias Joyram Byapari, had been imprisoned in Bangladesh and had previously worked with Border Guard Bangladesh. Bangladesh media reports suggested that after the STF busted the terror module in Haridevpur, the Bangladeshi Police’s Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime Unit caught Kausar Hossain from Khulna for allegedly leading two neo-JMB modules there. The STF said it had shared information about the arrests with other counter-terrorism agencies, including the NIA. “It is part of any routine investigation,” said a source. The officers on Tuesday doubled their efforts to track down local linkmen who reportedly helped the three JMB members settled in Kolkata. At least two of them, claimed investigators, had been living in this city for more than a decade and might slip out of Bengal, now that a hunt was on. The STF on Tuesday recorded statements of the residents of Haridevpur’s Jagorani Sangha, finding details about accused Pavel (22), Mikail Khan alias Sk Sabbir (30) and Rabiul Islam (22) as well as Selim Munshi, the linkman who helped them find a rented house. The landlord of the house, Sk Mintu, was questioned. “We asked about the three’s routine and how well Mintu knew Munshi,” said a senior officer. The STF is also enquiring about Munshi’s brother Halim, who settled here and married a local woman. “Sk Shakeel, who was asked to prepare Aadhaar cards for the three JMB accused, is on radar. He was helped by his associate, Ganesh Byapari, the surname Pavel used to create fake documents. We are hunting for him,” said an officer. The phone numbers found in a diary from the rented room were all currently switched off. “Tracking and mapping the phones will help us gain knowledge of the terror network further,” said an officer.

---||Delhi||Vaccine shortage forcing us to shut down centres, says Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday said that the capital could administer three to four lakh vaccine doses against Covid-19 a day but was forced to repeatedly shut down vaccination centres as enough vaccines were not being supplied to the state. “There is a shortage of vaccines in Delhi. We received a small stock of 1.5 lakh of Covishield on Monday night, which shall last till Tuesday. This in effect will again cause the centres to shut after the stock gets finished on Tuesday,” Jain said. “We have the capability to administer three to four lakh vaccine doses a day,” Jain said, adding that despite a robust infrastructure, centres have to shut down because Delhi has only 1.68 lakh vaccines, which would not last beyond Tuesday or first half of Wednesday. “We are fully prepared to vaccinate people, but there’s a lack of vaccines which halts our otherwise smooth going vaccination programme,” Jain said. “We can’t function like Haryana and slowly vaccinate people to hoard on stocks. We are vaccinating the maximum number of people as and when we are receiving the vaccines.” Jain said the number of Covid-19 positive cases was now the lowest in 15 months, the number of active cases below 700 and the positivity rate below 1%. “Covid cases have come down sharply in Delhi but I still urge people to take complete precautions and wear masks at all times. I believe we can prevent the third wave if people abide by Covid norms. We saw a similar situation back in January-February when people thought that the cases had come down sharply,” he said. Jain said that people shouldn’t assume that cases had gone down and wouldn’t rise again. “As long as Covid-19 cases exist in the public, the virus can spread around. The only prevention from this situation is wearing a mask. Always wear a mask while stepping out of the house,” said the health minister. Jain said during the peak of Covid-19 cases, at least 25% of hospital beds in Delhi were occupied by those from outside Delhi and everyone received free treatment. “Even today, when we are seeing a handful of admissions, 25-30% of them belong to areas outside of Delhi. We all know there was a shortage of oxygen in Delhi. There was a clear shortage. We needed oxygen, so we asked for it. If we need it again, we will ask for it again,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vax-shortage-forcing-us-to-shut-down-centres-says-jain/articleshow/84389929.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Delhi||Delhi: Notorious snatcher shot in knee by police||NEW DELHI: A notorious snatcher was shot in the knee by Delhi Police’s Special Cell during an encounter in southwest Delhi on Monday night. The accused is recuperating in a hospital and will be arrested upon discharge. DCP (Special Cell) Sanjeev Yadav said the snatcher, Abdul Wahid Ansari, was a history-sheeter from Najafgarh. “He was caught on a CCTV camera snatching from a victim in Najafgarh on July 8, which prompted a manhunt against him. He was wanted in several recent cases of robbery and snatching,” he added. A tip-off about Ansari’s whereabouts was received by a team led by ACP Sanjay Dutt after which surveillance was mounted to zero in on him. On July 12, cops were informed that he would be coming to Dwarka around midnight. Later, he was spotted riding a scooter on the Jhatikra stretch. When police signalled Ansari to stop, he tried to flee. During a chase, he shot at the cops after which he was shot in the knee, police claimed. While the cops fired thrice, Ansari shot once. During interrogation, he disclosed that he was a drug addict and took to crime after his wife left him. Ansari is the fifteenth suspect to be arrested by teams led by the DCP in the last one week after shootouts. On the night of July 6, two robbers, Sazee and Tazim Saifi, were arrested near Karni Singh Shooting Range. Soon after, a notorious robber, Deepak, was caught from Rohini. This was followed by a wanted snatcher, Pradeep, and two other snatchers, Yashpal and Vikas, being arrested from Rohini. A day after this, two illegal firearms suppliers, Abdul Wahab and Farman, were arrested after a shootout in Dwarka and a snatcher, Javed alias Pager, was nabbed after being shot at in Shahbad Dairy. Special Cell sleuths also caught five suspects after an encounter in north Delhi.

The 70-metre road now can be used, including access to the onion wholesale hub through Nawab Lane. This will come as a relief for traders as hand-pulled carts and cycle vans, which transport sacks of onions from the trucks to the wholesale market, can now access the lane that had been debarred. “Once the barricades are removed, the section will be available to traders from Wednesday. This will reduce the detour they had to take to reach the onion and ginger mandis,” said an officer from Howrah Bridge traffic guard. Work has begun on the next stretch between Nawab Lane and Old Mint. Police have kept a lane for cycle vans to ensure business isn’t disrupted. “Work is underway to dismantle girders between piers 6 and 7,” said a KMDA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/strand-rd-stretch-opens-after-posta-flyover-work/articleshow/84389973.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

A makeshift bus stand greeted passengers at the railway station. But now, in July 2021, Ahmedabad’s premier transport service will construct its first ‘official’ bus stand at Kalupur station at the cost of Rs 50.66 lakh. Senior AMC officials told TOI that in 2013, for the third phase of the city’s BRT network, the budget for each bus stand was between Rs 95 lakh and Rs 1.03 crore depending on the location. “Interestingly, the new BRT bus stand at Kalupur station will be built at half the cost of the 2013 budget,” a senior official said. Back in 2013, when the BRT ventured into the Walled City, it had connected the Tilak Baug, Delhi Darwaza, Sarangpur, and Lal Darwaza routes. “The Kalupur BRT station was delayed as the traffic police and Western Railway were redesigning the parking and the pickup and drop points for passengers at the station,” a senior Ahmedabad Janmarg Limited official said. “Temporary tin-shed bus stands were erected a few hundred metres away from Kalupur station.” The construction of the bus stand will begin in August, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/at-last-brt-stop-for-kalupur-station/articleshow/84389952.cms||---

Wadekar, who had nine cases of murder, attempt to murder and extortion registered against him, was shot at and later hacked to death by a gang of six men at Holewadi near Rajgurunagar in the early hours of Monday. A local crime branch team led by senior inspector Padmakar Ghanwat took the suspects, Vijay Jagdale (31) and Jitendra Gopale (31), into custody from Rajgurunagar, while the Rajgurunagar police arrested the main suspect, Milind Jagdale (30). Ghanwat said Wadekar and the suspect had an old rivalry. A few months ago, Wadekar had a brawl with Milind Jagdale and other suspects. Wadekar, who was externed from Khed and Junnar limits, for six months had come home to meet his daughter in the early hours of Monday. “The suspects blocked his way at Holewadi on Pabal Road and attacked him with sharp weapons. One of them also fired one round towards Wadekar from a firearm. The suspects then bludgeoned Wadekar to death and fled,” Ghanwat said.

---||Mumbai||US firm’s claim in Rona Wilson case can’t be relied upon: Maharashtra tells Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The US digital forensics firm has no legal ground to give its opinion unless sought by the court, the state has told Bombay high court on Arsenal Consulting’s claim that evidence was “planted” on the personal computer of Elgar Parishad/Bhima Koregaon accused Rona Wilson. “When the trial is pending and is sub-judice, M/s Arsenal Consulting has no locus standi to give such opinion without permission of the court,’’ said the reply filed by Pune police on July 1 on Wilson’s plea to quash the FIR and chargesheet against him citing Arsenal’s report. The reply said Pune police conducted similar searches on all accused and did not follow a different procedure for Wilson. In January 2020, the investigation was transferred to the NIA. The reply said Wilson states his computer was attacked while in his possession and 22 months before registration of FIR in January 2018, it means “that the alleged attack had taken place even before the prosecuting agencies had come into the picture.” “This being the position, the contention of the petitioner that he is innocent and is framed by the prosecuting agency is totally incorrect and as such deserves to be ignored,” it added. The reply said Wilson’s contentions are “entirely based” on Arsenal’s report which is not part of the chargesheet and cannot be relied upon. “This report does not form part of the chargesheets filed by the respondent (Pune police) and National Investigation Agency and hence, there is no question of looking into it.” Urging dismissal of Wilson’s petition as it lacks merit, the state said if Wilson wanted to rely on Arsenal’s report, “the only avenue available to the petitioner is at the time of leading evidence during trial.” A bench of Justice S S Shinde and Nijamoodin Jamadar on Tuesday posted the matter for physical hearing on July 26. In a related case where transfer of probe to NIA is challenged by accused lawyer Surendra Gadling and poet-publisher Sudhir Dhawale, NIA told HC their accusations are a desperate attempt to thwart an ongoing investigation. It said casting mala fide against the NIA over indulging in procuring false, fabricated and manufactured evidence is a direct attack on the criminal justice system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/us-firms-claim-in-rona-wilson-case-cant-be-relied-upon-maha-tells-bombay-hc/articleshow/84392174.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Delhi||Slow pace of vaccination in Delhi worries experts||NEW DELHI: The slow pace of vaccination in Delhi has public health specialists worried. The positivity rate of Covid-19 in the national capital is currently less than a per cent and according to experts, it is the right time to scale up vaccination to cover the maximum possible population since the risk of spread of infection from vaccination centres will be less. “On Monday, we did not have a single dose of Covid-19 vaccine available. Even on Tuesday, we could get only about 700 doses of the vaccine that will be finished in two days,” a senior doctor from Lok Nayak Hospital, the biggest public hospital run by the Delhi government, said. Delhi has vaccinated about 90 lakh people till date; 25% people have received both doses of the vaccine while 75% have received a single dose. Delhi being the national capital should have been a role model in vaccinating the entire population at the earliest but that’s not happening, says Dr SK Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences.  “Unavailability of vaccines is a major impediment for this. We need to find means to achieve 100% vaccination. This will send a positive message across the country,” he said. Dhruv Tiwary, who is wheelchair-bound, said he went to All India Institute of Medical Sciences for vaccination last week.  “I tried booking an appointment through the CoWin app but couldn’t. Then, I thought of walking-in to get the first jab. However, to my utter surprise, the hospital said they weren’t administering the first dose of Covaxin to persons in the 18-44 years age group,” the 35-year-old said. “How are we going to fight the pandemic when we don’t have vaccines available easily even for the disabled people and that too at the country’s premier medical institute. The government must look into this,” Tiwary added. The decision to allow administering Covaxin — one of the Covid-19 vaccines available in Delhi — only to those who had received the first dose was taken by the state government as it didn’t have enough stocks available in June first week. Dr Vinay Aggarwal, who owns a private hospital in East Delhi, said they got permission to administer the first dose of Covaxin last week after continuous follow-ups with local authorities. “On Tuesday, we administered 160 doses of Covaxin at our vaccination centre. Of them, only about 25 were second doses,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/slow-pace-of-vaccination-worries-experts/articleshow/84390032.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Delhi||More active black fungus cases than Covid in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Mucormycosis or black fungus has emerged as a bigger challenge than Covid-19 in the capital for now. Currently, there are far more active black fungus cases than Covid-positive cases. These are mostly patients who took steroids without a doctor’s prescription and used oxygen cylinders at home while they were infected with the virus. Black fungus, which is usually found in the nasal, oral and orbital cavity, invaded the brain of some patients and turned into cerebral fungus, thereby causing their death. TimesViewMucormycosis cases have been prevalent for over a month now. It is a potentially fatal disease and the government should ensure that the medicine is easily accessible. Since the cure is expensive, authorities can also consider making it available at a reduced price for the patients.According to an official document accessed by TOI, Delhi had 952 active cases of black fungus as compared to 833 active Covid-19 cases on July 6. While 402 patients were admitted in private hospitals, 302 were in Delhi government hospitals and the rest in central government hospitals. Delhi government had flagged a shortage of injections needed to treat mucormycosis. The total requirement of amphotericin-B is around 1.5 lakh as each patient generally needs five injections every day. Usually, a patient needs 120-150 injections before full recovery, which takes over a month. The treatment is very expensive as each injection costs Rs 6,000-7,000. A man whose 58-year-old father was admitted with black fungus patch in the eyes to Lok Nayak Hospital, where a dedicated mucormycosis treatment facility has been created by Delhi government, said he could not survive for more than a fortnight. “It developed into cerebral fungus, which resulted in his death. He had recovered from Covid-19 around a month ago. We thought we were past the crisis situation, but soon he developed painful swelling in the eyes after which we rushed him to the hospital,” said the man. Nearly 1,656 mucormycosis cases have been reported in Delhi so far. However, in the past couple of weeks, the cases have stabilised. Compared with 10-15 cases being reported every day earlier, now only a couple of cases are being reported at Lok Nayak Hospital. A doctor handling such cases at a government hospital said most patients reported black fungus 7-15 days after recovering from Covid-19. “Among them, many took oxygen at home from cylinders procured from the open market, many of which are filled with non-medical grade oxygen. Several patients had a history of excessive steroids consumption, often without a doctor’s advice,” added the doctor. A source said around 60 patients among the 105 currently admitted at Lok Nayak Hospital have undergone surgery. Recovery usually takes 30-45 days. The patients belong to the 30-60 age group and have black fungus in the nasal and oral cavity and ocular infection. Over 10 cases of cerebral mucormycosis have been reported at Lok Nayak Hospital. “The symptoms include swelling around the eyes and face, black discolouration around nose and eyes, nasal congestion, fever, headache, cough, chest pain and shortness of breath. Patients who have recovered from Covid-19 must immediately see a doctor if they develop such symptoms,” said Dr Arun Gupta, a member of Delhi government’sCovid-19 expert committee.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Study suggests extension of existing AMTS, BRTS routes||AHMEDABAD: With addition of metro route in upcoming years, Ahmedabad would have three public transport modes - AMTS, BRTS and metro. The student projects, displayed as part of Summer Exhibition at CEPT University tried to address the issue of transport management. As part of the strategic plan for urban transport system studio by Shalini Sinha, Nitika Bhakuni and Hemangi Dalwadi, the student projects tackled issues ranging from integrated transport system to intermediate public transport, parking management and policies, road network development, travel demand assessment, safe mobility and pedestrian safety among others. A project by Nidhi Piludaria identified major demand corridors for all three modes and suggested integrated hubs for the last-mile connectivity. Another project by Katabathinieshwar carried out travel demand assessment for 2041 and indicated that there are 17 radials in the city that intersect different external and internal roads that need to be developed as hubs. The study indicated 6km as average trip length in Ahmedabad and 19 minute as average travel time. Several of the projects advocated transport growth on the future developments. For example, the extension of AMTS and BRTS routes in areas such as Science City, Kathwada GIDC, Vatva, Naroda and SP Ring Road can bring in the new passengers by connecting residential and work areas. A work by Yashraj Panchal suggested introduction of e-autos as intermediate transport connecting major modes. A project by Sarah Alexander focused on transport plan where upgrade of existing road networks was proposed. The road density is higher in the city and the study proposed reducing the average block size from 2.1 sq km to 1.9 sq km. A project by Ravi Sharma identified major issues as congestion on major roads, larger block size, no integration of various modes, absence of speed reduction units and parking on the roads. Other projects also looked into aspects such as congestion, traffic blind spots and pedestrian safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/study-suggests-extension-of-existing-amts-brts-routes/articleshow/84390005.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Nagpur||Nagpur gets 43,000 doses for Wednesday, slots full by Tuesday evening||NAGPUR: As the Nagpur district received 43,000 doses of Covishield, the vaccination programme is set to resume after a day’s break at government centres in the city and district on Wednesday. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) received 26,000 doses as per its allotment. This would force the civic body to conduct the vaccination in a limited manner at its over 150 centres in the city, as per NMC press note. With the inclusion of 18+ group beneficiaries last month, the daily vaccination capacity of the district has increased to over 50,000 while the government has been unable to supply enough doses. Hence, the drive has been running with several breaks ranging from a day to three at a stretch. Following receipt of fresh doses, the district and civic administrations made available online slot bookings from 7pm onwards. Expectedly, most of the city centres were fully booked. By 10pm, limited slots were available at around 30 centres in the city and periphery of the district. The acute ongoing shortage has not only affected the second dose of 45+ age group and elderly citizens but also health care workers and frontline workers (FLWs) who were the preferred groups after the roll out of the mega drive. In the city, over 10.45 lakh vaccinations have been completed. These include first dose of 46,412 of HCWs, 53,367 of FLWs, 87,490 of 45+ comorbid groups and 1,88,698 of elderly citizens among others. Correspondingly, only 26,267 HCWs, 24,994 FLWs, 25,251 45+ comorbids and 1,07,034 elderly citizens have completed their second doses. Worringly, the percentage of second dose remains around 50% of the first of HCWs and FLWs many of whom had taken their first dose between January and April. The government had increased the gap between two doses of Covishield to three months but due to shortage many are forced to wait beyond the gap period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/district-gets-43k-doses-for-wed-slots-full-by-tue-evening/articleshow/84390023.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The Bombay high court had on Friday last week directed the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the state government to remove debris from the Metro work sites on the Mula-Mutha riverbed. Removal of the debris has been expedited near the Sangam bridge site, where the Maharahstra Metro Rail Corporation (MahaMetro) has constructed a viaduct across the river, and also at a riverbed stretch between Deccan Gymkhana and Sambhaji garden. Viaduct work is also on at the second site. A senior MahaMetro official said the debris would be cleared from the sites in the next 10 days. The HC’s direction to PMC and the state government came after a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed by activists Sarang Yadwadkar, Arnavaz Aga and Arti Kirloskar on the dumping of debris on the riverbed. The MahaMetro official said necessary machinery, earth movers and trucks had been pressed into service to lift the backfilling from the sites. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro, said, “We are taking all measures to remove the material. It was there as a part of a planned activity to construct the temporary approaches to assist the work. Around 95% of the backfilling has been removed so far. There is a plan to clear the locations in the next 10 days. The site near the Bund Garden has already been cleared.” A PMC official said MahaMetro has been told to clear the sites at the earliest. Additional municipal commissioner Kunal Khemnar said, “We have initiated joint efforts at the Metro sites to remove the material from the riverbed. Our team is monitoring the work. We will seek from MahaMetro details of the work done. Apart from the Metro work sites, the PMC has also initiated steps to clear the debris and other material from the riverbed in other locations, such as Aundh. We are keeping an eye on the work progress and taking steps to remove encroachments from various locations as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mahametro-starts-removing-backfilling-from-riverbed-sites/articleshow/84392211.cms||---

He added, “We need to be alert and socially boycott those who pose threat to our national security.” The CM was in Gorakhpur to inaugurate 133 development projects of Rs 40.66 crore and lay the foundation of 104 projects of Rs 21.37 crore on Tuesday. On the importance of alertness of public and human intelligence, the CM said, “At Delhi’s Batla house area hearing and speech impaired children were used to threaten national security and now the government is dealing with them strictly. In another incident, with the help of human intelligence, pro-Pakistan terrorists were found and a huge pile of gun-powder, latest ammunition and bombs were recovered from their possession. These terrorists were planning to breach the peace and security of the nation.” On the occasion, the CM also gave keys to 11 beneficiaries of PM Awas Yojna. On the government’s achievements, he said that earlier governments were interested in naming the projects after their ancestors and not in bringing welfare schemes to the poor and needy. “Welfare scheme is the right of the poor and under PM Awas Yojna, only in Gorakhpur 25,000 poor people got houses and the government under Swanidhi Yojna took the street vendors towards self reliance,” he said. On checking the deaths caused by encephalitis he said, “Earlier, a large number of deaths were caused by encephalitis because of the dirty environment, but now we have controlled encephalitis. Our corporators also worked hard during the pandemic and with the joint efforts now Covid is also being eliminated from the state.” “Gorakhpur Nagar Nigam got a new building and after 100 years when people will see the building they will remember Mayor Sitaram ji. Good work pays and we should try to not disappoint those who selected us for their representation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/those-who-threaten-security-will-face-consequences-cm/articleshow/84392227.cms||Arjumand Bano

The parents said that the school’s action is based on a DoE circular, which states that a child has to necessarily attain three years of age for entry to nursery school. The circular was issued by DoE to meet the requirement of the National Education Policy 2020, which states that a child should have completed at least three years of age before May 31 of a year to be admitted to nursery level. The parents from Margao said that the admissions to nursery by the school had been carried out in January 2021. But the circular on NEP requirements from DoE came only in June. As per the admission notice put up by the school in January, a student who has attained two years of age could be admitted to nursery. The parents said that their children were accordingly admitted to the nursery section and they already paid the fees, when the DoE circular arrived in June, changing the age of admission. “The completed form of admission on behalf of my daughter was submitted by me on January 25, 2021. I was subsequently called to make the payment of fees. I have accordingly made the payment of Rs 13,300 for the months from June to August 2021. Further, an advance for March 2022 to May 2022 was also taken,” the parent of one child has stated in the letter to the CM. The parents said their daughter began attending online nursery classes from June 14. But the directorate’s circular came on June 22. The parents have urged the CM to withdraw the circular issued by DoE as it was issued after the admission process was completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/withdraw-circular-on-nursery-admissions-parents-urge-cm/articleshow/84390072.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Kamala Nehru Polytech staring at closure as college applies for upgrade||HYDERABAD: When Kamala Nehru Polytechnic for Women’s (KNPW) name went missing from the list of state’s polytechnic colleges ahead of the Polytechnic Common Entrance Test (Polycet-2021), thousands of hearts sank. KNPW — the first women’s polytechnic college in the country — has huge financial constraints and students say their worst fears came true when the name was missing from the list of polytechnic colleges for the academic year 2021-22 released by the department of education. While educationist say the move will put the brakes on the aspirations of scores of students, students have vowed to protest any move to shut it down. KNPW, whose foundation stone was laid by Jawaharlal Nehru, was established in 1961 by the Exhibition Society. While commissioner for technical education Navin Mittal told TOI that no final decision has been taken yet, he did confirm that the college had applied for upgradation to an engineering college. “Yes the college has applied for upgradation to engineering college,” said Mittal. Students and alumni of KNPW alleged that the Exhibition Society, with the state’s help, is trying to shut the college down and start a private engineering college in its place. “Polytechnic is the only course affordable for students from economically weaker sections. When I enquired about garment technology course in private institutes, they said it would cost around Rs 10 to Rs 15 lakh per annum. Here, I am spending only Rs 10, 000 per year. Closing down the college will deprive students like me of studying a course of their choice,” said Anusha G a second year for garment technology student, adding that a student can easily get a job paying between Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000 after completing diploma from KNPW. Revealing the reasons for many preferring this college for polytechnic, students said it has all facilities, quality of education is good, it is safe and has hostel facility as well. “Apart from a rich heritage, the infrastructure of the college is excellent. As it is a women’s college, there is security and parents prefer to send their daughter here,” said Induja S, an architect and alumni. Induja said that while her sister was married very early, she got an opportunity to continue her education as she secured admission at KNPW in 2009. “The alumni recommends this college as students will get best education and will have an opportunity to secure a job immediately after completing diploma. Many, especially from rural areas come here to do their diploma. Rather than schemes such as Kalyana Lakshmi or Shaadi Mubarak, state should continue to run colleges like KNPW ,” she added. KNPW chairman D Gangadhar Rao said they have made repeated requests to the board to continue services of 39 lecturers. “Ahead of Polycet, we are going to request again to continue services of contract lecturers and give admissions to students in the college,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kamala-nehru-polytech-staring-at-closure-as-college-applies-for-upgrade/articleshow/84390792.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The accused duo has been identified as Ankush Varma and Amit Sonkar, who had shot goon Aakash Andhewar thrice in broad daylight on Monday afternoon. As suspected, the shootout has turned out to be a revenge attack in retaliation to the murder of mafia kingpin Suraj Bahuriya, who was killed last year. LCB in-charge Balasaheb Khade said following instructions of SP Arvind Salve, the cops gathered information about the suspected shooters and dispatched a team led by PSI Sandeep Kapade after them. “One of the accused was arrested on Monday evening from Ballarpur town, while the other was rounded up late in the night from the outskirts,” he said. Both the accused have been handed over to Chandrapur city police for further investigations, Khade added. According to sources, Suraj Bahuriya was the kingpin of coal and illegal liquor mafia and was shot dead by Aakash Andhewar and gang in broad daylight in Ballarpur in August 2020. Total 10 accused were arrested in Bahuriya murder case and Andhewar, who was injured in the firing on Monday, was the main accused. Andhewar along with four others was released on bail, while five are still in jail. The rival Bahuriya gang was baying for blood after murder of their kingpin and was after Andhewar soon after he was bailed out of jail. The duo had tracked Andhewar in Raghuwanshi complex and had shot him thrice on Monday. Injured Andhewar has been admitted to a hospital in Nagpur and is learnt to be out of danger.

Neither the ongoing soft commercial launch nor work towards its ramp-up in India have been put on hold,” the company said in a statement. Dr Reddy’s, which is the Indian partner of Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), also said that the nationwide soft launch of the vaccine has reached over 50 cities and towns across the country since the pilot was kicked off on May 14 this year. The company, however, did not disclose the reasons hampering the full-fledged commercial rollout, which has been delayed by nearly a month going by mid-June timeline announced by the company earlier. After receiving EUA nod in the second week of April, Dr Reddy’s rolled out a soft pilot launch on May 14 with a senior Dr Reddy’s Laboratories official getting the first dose. As part of the pilot, the company started with vaccinating its employees and their families with the doses imported from Russia and after that opened up vaccinations to the general public at private hospitals last month. “Dr Reddy’s has partnered with major hospitals across the country for this purpose, all of whom have successfully administered Sputnik V in India, including ongoing commercial roll-outs to the public,” it said. The commercial rollout appears to have been hobbled by the lack of adequate imports from Russia even as the locally manufactured doses are yet to be available for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sputnik-v-commercial-launch-in-coming-weeks-dr-reddys/articleshow/84390908.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

While the state was paying salaries to contract lectures till last academic year, they refused to provide any support from this year citing a government order. Exhibition Society, meanwhile, claims that it has no money to pay faculty. “Many of us, including retired employees, are ready to teach students until the state and society figure out how to move forward. Closing the college is not a solution,” said Rama D, who works in the irrigation department. She said in the irrigation department itself, there are about 100 alumni of KNPW and added that there are several more in other departments. Rama said the government can send some of them on deputation to work in this college or allow those with less workload to teach students. Members of the alumni saidthe society is planning to close the college only for money as they hardly get Rs 4,000 per year per student as fee. “The state should immediately ensure admissions are not cancelled at KNPW for academic year 2021-22,” said K Swathi Maniputri, alumna and architect, who is among those on the forefront in the fight against the college’s closure.

The cops have seized 29 computers, two internet switches, modems and other accessories. According to DCP (south) Atul Thakur, a team of special staff was acting on a tip-off that an illegal call centre was being run from Sultanpur area of Fatehpur Beri. Fake Call Centre duping Foreign nationals with its employees impersonating as Service Centre Technicians for e-comm… https://t.co/VS27z65Vjy— DCP South Delhi (@DCPSouthDelhi) 1626159209000“This information was further developed and surveillance was mounted around the premises. When inputs were confirmed, a team led by inspector Atul Tyagi raided the premises and found an office set-up in place. The employees were caught red-handed while they were trying to dupe people on calls,” DCP Thakur said. The people at the call centre were allegedly pretending to be employed by Amazon Inc and used illegal techniques like VoIP calling, bypassing the legal international long-distance gateways. “The accused were extorting Amazon customers based in the USA by claiming their Amazon ID had been hacked and charges had been imposed upon them. When the customer would call back to know more about it, the accused would show them fake repair of their amazon ID through Any Desk app.The target would be made to pay up in the form of Target Gift Cards, which the accused would redeem,” said the DCP. On being asked about any licence and authority to run the call centre, no documents could be produced. The accused were then taken into custody. Mobile phones were recovered from the possession of the accused, which contained various US mobile numbers in a WhatsApp group. On average, they cheated over six US citizens a day and this fake call centre had been running for the last seven months. “Per day cheating is about $2500 USD. Total cheating done so far may be more than $5,25,000,” the DCP added. So far, the gang is suspected to have cheated around 1,200 people. Police are further investigating the finances and network of the syndicate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/26-held-as-fake-call-centre-targeting-us-citizens-busted/articleshow/84390091.cms||---
---||Goa||Higher secondary schools in Goa likely to get nod for increase in Class XI seats||PANAJI: In 2021, the highest number of 23,967 students enrolled for the Class X state board examination, of which 99.7% cleared the class. After the results were declared by the Board on Tuesday, admission process in higher secondary schools to enter Class XI began on Wednesday. With a high enrolment in Class X and the highest ever pass percentage in 2021, schools are set to see more demand than the number of Class XI seats available in higher secondary schools. In this scenario, the directorate of education (DoE) is likely to give schools permission to increase the number of seats per division. “The admission process to arts, commerce and vocational streams has been started by schools. But the centralised entrance test for entry to Class XI science and diploma seats is yet to be held. Once the entrance test results are out, and depending on the situation in schools, we will consider a solution,” said director of education D R Bhagat. Higher secondary schools are likely to get a levy to increase seats by upto 10 per division. To add a new division, schools have to seek special permission from the DoE as per their individual case. Meanwhile, due to the pandemic situation, higher secondary schools are devising ways to conduct the Class XI admissions without any crowding by students. Many schools started distributing their admission forms from the first week of July itself so the number of students visiting the schools to collect the forms are spread over a period of time. “From this week, as students submit their admission forms, our teachers are providing them counseling to help choose their stream. As for admissions to the science stream, they will only take place after the entrance test is conducted by the state. Though we are carrying out the admission process physically, we are ensuring that social distancing is maintained during the procedure,” said Rahul Deshpande of People’s High School, Panaji. Other institutes have already started taking forms from students who want to seek admission to Class XI science stream, but their selection will be based on results of the state entrance test. Secondary schools, which have higher secondary sections attached to them, had circulated Google forms through WhatsApp groups among its Class X batch, to understand the number of students looking to seek Class XI admission with the same institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/higher-secondary-schools-likely-to-get-nod-for-increase-in-class-xi-seats/articleshow/84390037.cms||---

The boat had set out from Tonca towards Sarmanas but drifted away towards Piligao due to strong winds. The operator could not control it due to damaged clutch plates. A major tragedy was averted as the crew of an anchored mining barge ran to the rescue of the commuters. The barge crew used a long rope and brought the ferry safely to the Sarmanas bank. Besides commuters, there were vehicles loaded in the ferry boat. In a similar incident last year, a ferry boat had drifted away towards Piligao due to bad weather condition. Most of the ferry boats plying on this route have become old and need urgent replacement in view of the long distance between the riverbanks. Piligao village panchayat panch member Anil Naik said the state government should immediately replace the old ferry boats with latest ones for the safety of the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/people-demand-better-ferry-service-on-sarmanas-route/articleshow/84392362.cms||---

Captain Soni laid down his life during Operation Meghdoot in 1987, while thwarting an attack by Pakistan forces. Jagdish Soni, his elder brother and a resident of Paldi, said that they had written to the Army a month ago asking if they could get soil from the post in remembrance of the officer. “We were pleasantly surprised that the Army worked swiftly and granted our wish,” he said. “For a martyr’s family, it is the biggest honour for us as nothing could be more valuable than the matrubhoomi where he laid down his life. I am sure it will inspire generations to serve the nation.” Along with the soil from Chandan Post, the family also received a memento from Commanding Officer Siachen 102 Brigade, a memento from the director general of the Artillery Regiment, a memento from the 313 Field Regiment, and a personal letter from the GOC Leh. “It was so thoughtful of the force to also gift us an empty artillery shell, in recognition of the fact that Nilesh served in an artillery regiment,” said Soni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/soil-where-martyr-laid-down-life-given-to-family/articleshow/84390059.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Narendra Modi said back Congress in 2017, says AAP||CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers voted for the Congress in Punjab during the 2017 state assembly elections on the orders of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to prevent the formation of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. AAP Punjab state president Bhagwant Mann and Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha claimed this on Tuesday. Addressing the mediapersons, the Punjab MP and the Delhi MLA said now the people of Punjab had come to know the “reality of the parties controlled by Modi” and by choosing the third option in 2022, they would form the AAP government in the state. Mann said there was a “lot of evidence of alliance between the Congress, SAD and BJP”, and now this evidence was coming to light time and again. He said that apart from the SAD’s Naresh Gujral, former president of Punjab Congress Pratap Singh Bajwa, Rajya Sabha member Shamsher Singh Dullo, along with former Congress minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, had also accused Capt Amarinder Singh of colluding with the Badals. “Even Congress MLA Raja Warring has accused finance minister Manpreet Badal of giving huge grants to the Akali Dal supporters with evidence,” he added. Mann said after the Badals, nothing had changed with the formation of Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in Punjab. “Sand mafia, transport mafia, liquor mafia, and drug mafia are operating in the same way,” he alleged. The Sangrur MP said the accused of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib, conspirators and those who fired at the protesting Sikhs were all roaming scot-free. He said that with the change of the government, only the colors of turbans had changed and the place of beating of the people of Punjab had changed. “Earlier, the people of Punjab used to get beaten up in Bathinda for demanding their rights and now they are being beaten up in Patiala,” he added. Chadha said the people of Punjab had seen the alliance between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Captain Amarinder Singh and they were ready to change the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-modi-said-back-cong-in-2017/articleshow/84392295.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa CM Pramod Sawant to chair meet on mode of exam for entrance test||PANAJI: Holding online entrance test for admission to Class XI science stream and diploma courses is feasible, but there are chances of malpractices by candidates, the findings of mock tests conducted by Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education for students of six rural talukas have revealed. Chief minister Pramod Sawant has, however, decided to hold a crucial meeting with Board officials to decide on whether to conduct the entrance test in offline or online mode. “I will hold meeting soon so that we can decide on the future course of exams,” Sawant told TOI. Last week, the Board had announced that registrations have opened for the common entrance test 2021 for students seeking admissions to Class XI science stream and diploma programmes. A mock test was conducted in six rural talukas of the state as a precursor to the actual test. This mock test was held after it surfaced that students in rural areas were experiencing major internet connectivity issues. Sawant had therefore suggested to the Goa Board to test the connectivity in these rural areas first so that children from these areas do not lose out during the actual entrance test. At the mock test conducted for 1,662 students from rural areas of six talukas including Sattari, Quepem, Pernem, Canacona, Bicholim and Sanguem, 80% were able to connect smoothly for the test. During the mock test, students were sent a link where they have to register with a username and password. Once a student logs in, his or her face is recognised and the camera of the mobile is used to continuously monitor the movement of the student so that there is no cheating. Recently, the state government cancelled SSC exams due to Covid-19 and decided to conduct entrance test for students who intend to take admissions to science stream and diploma courses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-to-chair-meet-on-mode-of-exam-for-entrance-test/articleshow/84390089.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Jet staff awaiting PF, gratuity pins hope on liquidation value||Mumbai: When the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) cleared Jet Airways' resolution plan last month to pave the way for its revival, the airline staff were joyous. “There was excitement and great hope of revival. The staffers’ claims, at least the statutory due such as gratuity will be paid and Jet will rise like a Phoenix,” said Dr N Hariharan, former senior vice-president, HR, at Jet Airways and a visiting professor at TISS. But when the 59-page NCLT order was released, the staff learnt that Kalrock-Jalan consortium’s resolution plan had proposed a lump sum of Rs 52 crore, 4% of the Rs 1,254 crore claims admitted by Jet’s resolution professional—the official who manages the entire process of insolvency and bankruptcy, that is. The 13,800-odd Jet staffers’ provident fund and gratuity add up to about Rs 280 crore, said sources, implying that the amount proposed to be paid by the consortium doesn’t cover even the statutory dues. The only hope now before Jet staffers is liquidation value —the estimated realizable value of Jet Airways assets on the insolvency commencement date—owed to them. This week, in a letter sent to the staff, the now erstwhile resolution professional said if the liquidation value owed to Jet workmen and employees is not “nil”, then that amount shall be paid to them, in priority over financial creditors (banks). An advocate, requesting anonymity, said: “The two safeguards under insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC) for workmen and employees is that they will at least get the liquidation value owed to them and it will be paid in priority. But in most cases, the liquidation value owed to staffers is either nil or not much. The banks get the biggest chunk, and rightly so. The workers’ dues are left to the mercy of the resolution applicant and committee of creditors (Kalrock-Jalan and banks led by SBI, in Jet’s case).” An insolvency resolution under the IBC is a creditor-driven process, the advocate said, adding that workmen and employees don’t have a say in how their dues will be handled in the resolution plan. The possibility of the liquidation value due to Jet staffers being large enough to cover their gratuity and PF dues is almost zero, he added. Hariharan said: “There is a stark difference between banks taking a haircut vis-à-vis workers and employees losing large chunks of their statutory dues. The Jet case has shown an urgent need to revisit the provisions that are highly discriminatory against employees.” The gratuity dues per staffer would range from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 30 lakh, said a Jet source. Advocate Ashok Shetty, who appears on labour matte-rs in the high court and Supreme Court, said: “Under Sect-ion 14 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, gratuity payment will prevail over all other enactments. Jet’s proposed settlement with the consortium being contrary to the statutory provisions will not be valid. What is happening to Jet staffers’ gratuity today could happen to staff of any airline or company tomorrow in spite of decades old enactments to protect the benefits of workmen.” According to a Jet source, in the February 25 NCLT hearing, the consortium’s counsel had sought a relief on payment of gratuity to the staff. “But NCLT judge V Nallasenapathy (member-technical), did not agree to it,” he said. For Jet staffers, a ray of hope would be Ahmedabad’s Rainbow Papers insolvency case of 2019. “On behalf of its workers, the PF commissioner appealed against the new owner’s decision to pay only 50% of PF dues, and won, both in the NCLT appellate court and in the Supreme Court,” said an advocate. The Jet source said: “Jet ran an ‘unfunded’ gratuity scheme, with no backing assets. The airline dipped into the gratuity account a few years ago.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-jet-staff-awaiting-pf-gratuity-pins-hope-on-liquidation-value/articleshow/84394165.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Worli milk deliveryman petitions PM for son’s release from Iran||MUMBAI: Over four months after being released from a prison in Iran after being found innocent in a narcotics case, five Indian sailors, including two from the city, continue to languish there as their passports have reportedly been withheld. The five, who were arrested after the Iranian navy intercepted their ship and seized 1.5 tonnes of morphine, have spent over a year in Chabahar central jail. While Aniket Yenpure (28), a deck cadet, and his cousin Mandar Worlikar (26) are from Mumbai, other crew members include Patna resident Pranav Tiwari (21), Naveen Singh (23) from New Delhi, and Thamizh Selvan (31) from Chennai. They have sought assistance from the Indian authorities for their repatriation. Aniket’s father Sham, a milk deliveryman from Worli, has been making every effort to secure the release of his son and nephew. Sham has even written to PM Narendra Modi and the ministry of external affairs for help. He says the Indian embassy in Iran has not come to their aid. “We are trying to bring them back. There are problems from India in sending money for their repatriation due to sanctions. We are trying to find a way out,” Director-General of Shipping Amitabh Kumar told TOI. Sham says all the youngsters hail from lower middle-class families and had taken huge loans to pay agents to get the jobs on ‘MV Artin10’, owned by an Iranian, Razaee Mukkadam. “It was Aniket’s first job on board a merchant ship. I had taken loans and even mortgaged my late wife’s gold to secure this job for him,” Sham told TOI. Recalling the turbulent turn of events, Sham said his son and the others were supposed to sign off from the ship in January 2020, when the ship’s master, Captain M Rasool Gharebi, informed them about a change in plan. The captain is said to have informed them they would be heading towards Oman to load cement bags and then to Kuwait to offload the cargo. “On the midnight of February 20, 2020, they were around 140km away from Muscat when the captain ordered the ship to drop anchor. Aniket said he noticed bags being loaded from another vessel. They were told it was rice,” said Sham. The next morning, while they were on the high seas, the Iranian navy intercepted the vessel and arrested them. “The navy seized 1.5 tonnes of morphine. The ship’s captain admitted before officials that the Indians were innocent and they had no clue about the contents of the cargo,” said Sham. He says the investigation lasted over a year. “On March 9, the Chabahar court found my son and the others innocent and ordered their release,” Sham said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-worli-milk-deliveryman-petitions-pm-for-sons-release-from-iran/articleshow/84392374.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

---||Delhi||Civic bane: No clarity on which door to knock on||New Delhi: Multiplicity of authorities is still a problem for Delhiites in securing civic services and a unified complaints management system is urgently required to resolve the issue, stated a report on the status of civic issues released by Praja Foundation on Tuesday. The system of online complaints also needs major overhauling, the NGO’s latest annual report pointed out. “Multiple complaint touch points, including multiple phone numbers, applications and different jurisdictions, create major confusion. The systems are not laid out properly, which is why majority of time residents end up sending the complaints to the wrong department and it remains unaddressed,” said Yogesh Mishra, research and data head of Praja Foundation. Recommending a citizen-centric approach, Mishra said, “Civic bodies’ complaint management systems do not have a mechanism to track the status of complaints. Further, the action-taken reports are not generated in the corporations’ complaints system while the ATRs generated by Delhi Jal Board (DJB) are not shared with the citizens.” Water leads among the sectors that have seen an increase in the number of complaints, according to the NGO. Out of the total 3,36,868 complaints lodged last year, DJB’s share is 2.3 lakh, out of which 1.4 lakh were related to no water, short supply, leakage of pipelines, tanker supply, contamination and other factors such as low pressure and unauthorised connection. Although out of around 2 lakh samples collected, only 0.4% were unfit, 27 % (38,663) of the complaints received by DJB were related to contamination, stated the report. In the case of municipal corporations, the majority of complaints were related to solid waste management. “The waste management rules prescribed for 100% door-to-door collection. While the Central Pollution Control Board data suggested 100% waste collection by corporations as on 2020-21, 19% (28,149) of the total complaints received by the corporations were related to garbage not lifted and collection point not attended,” the report stated. In 2020, three model wards in North Delhi Municipal Corporation, 15 in the south corporation and all wards in the east corporation segregated 80-100% of waste collected while the rules prescribes for 100% segregation at source, it pointed out. “Around 48% of the waste is disposed into landfills from the three corporations till date.” The community toilet seats for women are 17% less than those for men under corporations, while under Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board, it’s 21% less. In the case of corporations, 10% of all public and community toilets are not connected to the piped sewerage system. “The maximum figure is in the central zone (south corporation) where 27% and Keshav Puram (north corporation) where 21% of the toilets have no sewer connection. In 16% of all toilets, there was no water connection.” It added that there was no electricity in 10% of all toilet blocks and “this is a major safety concern rendering the public toilet unusable at night”. Praja said the data for the report had been obtained through Right to Information Act, 2005. South corporation mayor Mukesh Suryan, however, doubted the sources of information, claiming its toilets and garbage management system were working up to the mark. “We are also carrying out random checks to ascertain operations of our systems,” he claimed. North corporation mayor Raja Iqbal Singh said the services in Keshav Puram zone was rather better and covered many posh colonies. “It is difficult to believe that the public toilets here have no sewer connection or electricity supply. We will still get the status checked,” he said. The jal board did not respond to the findings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/civic-bane-no-clarity-on-which-door-to-knock-on/articleshow/84390263.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Postmortem, RTO inspection hold key in custodial death case||NAGPUR: The detailed postmortem report and RTO inspection of the scooter driven by custodial death victim Manoj Thawkar will prove important in the case now being investigated by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID). The statement of Thawker’s kin before the State CID at their residence added a new twist to the case. As per their statement, Thawker was riding on a scooter which had it’s brake damaged and hence he could not stop when cops tried to stop him. The statements of the family members were recorded by State CID at the victim’s residence at Pardi, so as to make them feel at ease and comfortable in their own surrounding. Earning a livelihood as a two-wheeler mechanic, Thawker and his client were returning after buying some spare parts for the damaged scooter when they rammed into cops on bandobast duty last week near Pardi Naka. Thawkar’s scooter dragged an officer for some distance leaving him injured. Thawker was allegedly beaten up by the cops and later taken to police station,where he was further tortured, leading to his death. Thawker was physically and visually challenged. Sources said the statements of the relatives regarding the damaged brake of the scooter driven by Thawkar would require State CID to get the two-wheeler technically examined by the RTO authorities. “If the vehicle’s brake is found damaged in the expert examination, then the case would take an interesting turn,” said an officer. Though State CID has already received provisional postmortem report, the opinion regarding cause of death was kept ‘reserved’ until the histo-pathological analysis was done. The investigating agency is now waiting for the detailed report to decide on the future course of action. The present case of accidental death may get converted to either murder or culpable homicide not amounting to murder, depending upon the reports from the forensic experts regarding whether the injuries on the body were responsible for the death. The case is now also attracting political attention with NCP leaders visiting the victim’s residence at Pardi on Tuesday. A day ago, former CM and incumbent leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis had met the family members. Apart from justice for the victim, the leaders demanded a job for the wife of the deceased and also suspension of erring cops.

---||Meerut||Woman sub-inspector posted in Uttar Pradesh's Shamli duped by cybercriminals of Rs 1 lakh, one held||MUZAFFARNAGAR: A woman sub-inspector, Poonam Gautam, posted in Shamli district was allegedly duped of Rs 1 lakh by cybercriminals. Acting swiftly on her complaint, the district cyber cell not only got Gautam’s bank account freeze but also arrested a cybercriminal from Jharkhand, said police. Gautam said she had received a message on her phone asking her to speak to the bank on a toll-free number. After a brief communication, she realised that Rs 1 lakh was transferred from her bank account. Police said Gautam immediately informed Adesh Mandi police station about the money transfer, and the cyber cell was altered. Police said that they approached the bank, where the woman officer had an account, and got her account freeze immediately. Adarsh Mandi police, meanwhile, arrested an accused, Ilyas, from Paharpur village under Devipur police station of Deoghar district in Jharkhand. Investigation officer Gautam Singh said, “A big racket is being run in Jharkhand. The money was transferred to four bank accounts. We have arrested one accused, who has received Rs 25,000, while the other accused are on the run.” In a separate cybercrime, a newly-installed centralised cyber cell in Muzaffarnagar managed to reverse Rs 56,000 that was taken from a woman’s bank account. Anjum, a resident of Minakshi Chowk, has filed a complaint that a fake agent of an e-commerce company had called her and withdrew Rs 56,000. Cyber cell officials — a cybercrime cell was formed in Muzaffarnagar, weeks ago — reacted immediately and approached the bank, and the money was reversed into her account after a few hours, said police. “Earlier, it used to be a lengthy process. A victim would first approach a police station, which would then send a report to the cyber cell. In this process, crucial time was lost. Besides, many a time, victims don’t report fearing lengthy processes and slim chances of recovery. As per bank rules, if the crime is reported within 24-48 hours, there are high chances that the entry is reversed,” said Muzaffarnagar SSP Abhishek Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/woman-si-posted-in-shamli-duped-by-cybercriminals-of-rs-1-lakh-one-held/articleshow/84387779.cms||Mohd Dilshad

SAD industry and trade wing president N K Sharma said industry was literally shut in Punjab due to restrictions on power use by heavy industry. He said this was coupled with high power rates of up to Rs 11 per unit. The Dera Bassi MLA added industry had lost faith in the CM, who had failed to keep any promise made to them. Sharma said industrial sector was promised power at a landing cost of Rs 5 per unit, but this promise was not kept. He said the Congress government had even gone back on its promise to waive fixed charges for two months during the period of complete lockdown last year. “The industrial sector, which has suffered the most during the Covid pandemic, did not receive any help or financial package from the state government,” he added. The SAD leader said industrialists were looking for alternative investment options due to these factors as well as worsening law and order, which led to a wave of kidnappings and extortions. “Industrialists don’t feel safe in Punjab,” said the Akali leader, adding this was why a delegation of industrialists had met Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Aditiyanath to explore investment options in that state. “We will witness a flight of capital from Punjab to Uttar Pradesh and other states in case the Congress government does not take urgent steps to resolve the grievances of trade and industry,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/captains-failures-making-industry-look-at-up-akalis/articleshow/84392354.cms||---

Vice chancellor of the seminary, Abul Qasim Nomani, said, “This policy is against every section of society. What kind of policy denies basic facilities to families that have more than two children? It is against human rights.” According to the draft, anyone who has more than two children will not be able to contest local body polls, will not get promotion in government jobs and will not receive any government subsidy. Asked if the seminary will appeal to the government to reconsider the decision, spokesperson Ashraf Usmani said, “Who are we to make an appeal? But we can say that this is not right. For example, a man has three children. Now what is the fault of those children, why are they being deprived of basic facilities? This is not justice.” Union minister Sanjeev Balyan was quick to respond. “There was no need for Darul Uloom to give such a statement. Why is religion being dragged into it? We have the second largest population in the world and we are still growing very fast. It is the right time to act on it now,” Balyan said. VHP has also expressed reservation over the bill. In its letter to the state government, it said that the one-child policy norm is likely to lead to furthering of the imbalance between different communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-population-control-bill-will-hurt-every-section-darul/articleshow/84387825.cms||---

They said Arish committed the crime after getting influenced by videos on social media platforms that show people flaunting guns. The Class X student from Pasonda village in Ghaziabad wanted to make a similar video. The matter came to the fore on July 6 when sub-inspector from Karan Gate police chowki Mohit Kumar found that an INSAS rifle was missing. An FIR against unknown person was registered under the section of 380 (theft) and 457 (Lurking house-trespass or house- breaking by night in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) of IPC. The police checked CCTV footage where they saw a boy stealing the gun. He was then identified. He had dug a pit inside his house in Pasonda village to hide the rifle, which has been recovered, said an officer. Before this incident, the Class X student was booked for creating a nuisance. “In the past couple of weeks, he used to frequently come to the police station for the matter. This is when he stole the key to the room where arms are kept. On an opportune moment, he stole the weapon,” the officer explained. SP-II (Ghaziabad) Gyanendra Singh said the matter is being probed. “A report on the same has been submitted to SSP Ghaziabad by Sahibabad SHO. The boy has confessed to the crime and has been booked under relevant sections of IPC. Further actions will also be taken up in the case for negligence of policemen in duty,” he said The boy was sent to judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/class-x-boy-steals-rifle-from-police-chowki-to-shoot-video-arrested/articleshow/84392380.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

---||Delhi||Reduced Parking Area For Fresh Projects Close To Metro Stations||New Delhi: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Tuesday gave its final approval to the draft policy for dynamic parking norms, which aims to rationalise usage of parking space in the city. DDA also approved inclusion of Affordable Rental Housing Complex (ARHC) Scheme in Master Plan for Delhi 2021. The draft policy for dynamic parking norms has been approved by the authority, DDA’s apex body, in a meeting chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, considering the changed scenario of transportation. The policy has rationalised the parking norms, which includes deduction in parking space of an upcoming non-residential project by up to 30% if it is within 500 metres of a Metro station, 15% if it is located between 500 and 800 metres and 10% if it is within a kilometre of a multi-level car parking. For residential projects, the parking norms will now be based on the number and size of the dwelling units instead of the built-up area. Parking norms for government buildings will also be rationalised as most visitors use public transport to reach their offices. On the other hand, the parking norms in case of banquet halls have been enhanced keeping in view the orders of National Green Tribunal. The enhanced norms are aimed at ensuring that there is adequate parking space inside such venues so that vehicles don’t spill over to roads outside and cause congestion. The norms have been formulated based on a study conducted by Delhi Urban Art Commission and discussions with other stakeholders and experts. It will now be forwarded to the Union housing and urban affairs ministry for its consideration and final notification. Once notified, these norms will be applicable on the new as well as all ongoing projects, a DDA spokesperson said. The policy, he pointed out, will ensure better utilisation of public funds as in many government buildings, such as hospitals, most people use public transport or paratransit to access these facilities and the basements constructed for parking remain unused. “To ensure that there is no anomaly while calculating the equivalent car space norms and to ensure that the norms are uniformly applicable across all categories in the master plan, the term built-up/floor area, wherever provided for calculating parking norm, has been replaced by FAR area,” the spokesperson said. This will also align the norms as per the procedure followed for sanctioning building plans under the ambit of Unified Building Bye Laws 2016, he added. The other major decision taken in the meeting is the inclusion of Affordable Rental Housing Complex Scheme in MPD 2021 to create vibrant, sustainable and inclusive affordable rental housing avenues for urban migrants and urban poor, the spokesperson said. The proposal paves the way for ARHCs on private or government-owned land on a priority basis. As per the approved norms, these housing complexes will have a mix of one and two-bedroom flats and dormitories of four to six beds, including all common facilities. DDA will provide the maximum overall FAR of 50% over and above the permissible FAR to incentivise the concept of ARHCs in Delhi. The policy provides for a maximum 10% of permissible FAR to be utilised as commercial component, which could be rented or sold by the developer. The occupancy of ARHCs will be granted on the basis of a licence deed with a minimum tenure of three months and a maximum tenure of three years, ensuring accessibility to all eligible beneficiaries for ARHCs, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/reduced-parking-area-for-fresh-projects-close-to-metro-stations/articleshow/84390298.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Barring Anjunem reservoir in Sattari, all other major and minor dams in the state are now filled to the brim. The Selaulim reservoir in Sanguem, which supplies raw water to meet the drinking water requirement of most of South Goa, began spilling over at 6am on Tuesday. The excess water is now being released from the unique duck bill spillway of the Selaulim reservoir. Officials of the Water Resources Department (WRD) said that water in the dams have reached their capacity as per the trends seen annually. “Dams usually reach their capacity by mid-July. The water levels recorded at the dams are as per the normal annual trends,” said a WRD official. While water level at Selualim stands at 100%, the Amthane reservoir, which supplies water to Bardez and parts of Bicholim, is 98% full. Water levels at the minor Panchawadi and Gaunem reservoirs in South Goa have been recorded at 100% and 80%, respectively. In Chapoli, the reservoir that meets the water requirement of Canacona, the water level has reached nearly 70% of the dam’s capacity. Only the water level in Anjunem in Sattari stands at 43%. WRD officials said that it takes the large reservoir longer due to its carrying capacity to reach full level as compared to the other dams in the state. Meanwhile, the Tillari dam in Dodamarg, Maharashtra, across the border has also reached its capacity. Water from the dam, as per an understanding between Goa and Maharashtra, is used to meet the water requirements of Bicholim, Pernem and Bardez talukas in Goa. Water level at Tillari reservoir stands at 82% of its capacity. Officials, however, said that there is no danger of flooding due to the water release from the dam. “At present the discharge from Tillari reservoir is 100 cubic metre per second. It is very less. It has to be 800-1000 cubic metre per second for there to be any danger of a flood like situation,” said WRD executive engineer MK Prasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rain-pushes-reservoirs-towards-full-capacity/articleshow/84392557.cms||---

Anandewar, whose post-mortem was conducted on Tuesday at Mayo hospital, had called up his friends to reveal his plan before riding his bike into the lake water. After registering a case of accidental death, Ambazari police have hardly made any progress as senior officers were unable to unearth the reason behind Anadewar’s taking the drastic decision in a dramatic manner. Cops had earlier stated that family members have not revealed any clue nor friends with whom the deceased was said to be close. Anandewar was learnt to be friendly with many females too but cops could not gather any information whether the deceased was having any close relations with any one of them. The deceased had also gone for a day out with his friends to a resort but it’s still not clear before to the cops whether he had any issues. Cops were also unable to unearth whether Anandewar, younger of the two siblings, had any issue with his family members which may have prompted him to take the extreme step. CP Amitesh Kumar said cops are trying to find out the reasons behind the suicide but there is no concrete information as of now. “We would need another day to zero in on the real issue due to which the teenager ended his life,” said Kumar, adding, cops are working on the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-clueless-regarding-teens-suicide-at-futala/articleshow/84390260.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Allahabad||SIT to probe ex-soldier’s torture by Uttar Pradesh policemen: Govt to Allahabad HC||PRAYAGRAJ: The state government on Monday informed the Allahabad high court that a special investigation team (SIT) has been constituted to investigate into the plea filed by a retired soldier of the Indian Army alleging humiliation and brutal torture by the Uttar Pradesh Police. The state government informed the court that the SIT will also investigate the charges made in the FIR lodged by retired soldier Resham Singh. Further action, including the arrest of the accused police officers, would be effected if they are prima facie found to be guilty in the preliminary inquiry. Keeping the submissions made by the state government on record, a division bench comprising Justices Surya Prakash Kesarwani and Gautam Chaudhari directed to put up this case on July 16 for further hearing. On the directions of the court, the UP DGP filed a counter-affidavit by means of a personal affidavit on Monday. The state counsel, on the basis of the counter-affidavit, informed the court that some action has been taken against the accused police officers, including sub-inspector Sunil Kumar Sharma and investigation officer Ram Naresh Singh, and a preliminary inquiry is being conducted. The state counsel said, the up-to-date status of the matter shall be placed before this court on the next date of hearing, when Advocate General of UP shall also appear before the court. On July 8, after taking into account the injury reports and FIR filed by the retired soldier, the HC had observed: “Prima facie, it shows a very sorry state of affairs — police atrocities and a breach of fundamental rights of the petitioner by the accused police officials.” Emphasising that the matter is serious and requires serious consideration of the court, it had directed the UP DGP to file a counter-affidavit by means of his personal affidavit, indicating the action taken in the matter. On May 2, Singh, along with his mother and two sisters, was going to Lakhimpur Kheri from Pilibhit, when they were stopped by the police officials at around 9am. The police then asked for the papers of the car, in which they were travelling. Since it was reportedly taking time to sort out the papers, the police officials “abused the victim and his family members”. The victim asked the officials to not abuse them and also informed that he was a retired member of the armed forces. This infuriated the policemen, who threatened the victim and his family members that they would teach them a lesson for life. They then started abusing and beating the victim with lathis. They also allegedly beat his mother and sisters and took them to the police station without taking the assistance of any woman officer. At the police station, the victim was allegedly disrobed and tied on a cot and brutally beaten up by the said police officials for two hours. They also gave him third-degree torture only to satisfy their ego, the petitioner alleged. Thereafter, he lodged an FIR against the erring officials and took treatment in the army hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/sit-to-probe-ex-soldiers-torture-by-up-policemen-govt-to-hc/articleshow/84392427.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

One of these Congressmen has warned Warring that if he tried to take Manpreet down in Bathinda, he’ll jeopardise his own election campaign in the nearby assembly segment of Gidderbaha a few months down, since unity is a must for winning.

We are close to the elections and he, too, will want to contest. Party loses, he loses." Pradesh Congress committee delegate Pawan Mani said: "Warring seems to be jealous of all the development in Bathinda."

Jagan has pleaded that the CBI could not show a single piece of evidence to substantiate its claim that it was at Jagan’s behest that the state accorded certain benefits to the Penna group. Not even one in the nearly 90 witnesses cited by the CBI said anything about his involvement in the allotments, Jagan said in his plea. “This is because there were no procedural errors committed, no misuse of public assets intended. Whatever limestone mines or land given to Penna cements was given to it because every cement factory requires them to run its factory and produce cement,” the plea said. It was done in tune with the established procedures duly obtaining the permissions from the revenue, industries and finally the cabinet itself, Jagan said in his plea. The process of allotment of 234 acres of land to Penna in Yadiki mandal of Anantapur district was narrated in the CBI chargesheet itself. It took two and a half years for this allotment to attain finality. “There is nothing on record to show that then chief minister YSR exerted any pressure on the cabinet. The cabinet took the decision after due deliberations,” he said. The CBI court has sought a counter from the probe agency and posted the case to June 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-error-committed-discharge-me-from-penna-chargesheet/articleshow/84392443.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The labourers – six of them over 60 – are stuck near an under-construction power plant in Padum at 12,000 ft in Kargil and many have fallen sick due to the cold weather while others have complained of shortness of breath as they were not accustomed to such high elevations. The workers were promised lucrative work in J&K and taken there on a private bus last week by the contractor, according to their families, who alleged that the men were unaware that they would be working outside the city in extreme weather conditions. At present, they have taken shelter in a nearby dharamshala, but are finding it difficult to arrange for meals in the remote region. “The men were told they would be working for a Jammu-based construction company but were dumped at a power plant elsewhere in the state. After they had a confrontation with the contractor, he went missing,” Satpal Singh, whose son is among those stranded, said. Singh said mobile connectivity was also an issue in the area as prepaid SIM cards weren’t working there. “We only learnt of their condition when my son managed to call from a postpaid SIM.” On Tuesday, the families of the labourers met local BJP MLA Suchi Chaudhary and informed her about the situation. The MLA told TOI that she has spoken to the authorities and they were looking into the possibility of bringing them back on a flight. “I have spoken to the men who are stuck in Kargil as well. Some of them have fallen ill because of the weather. We are considering bringing them back via air,” she said. The labourers belong to Ravali and Jandarpur villages of Bijnor district as well as Gajraula in Amroha district. Most of them are illiterate and have travelled to Jammu for the first time, according to their kin. Dharmendra Bharti, whose relative, 60-year-old Santaram, is among the stranded labourers said most of the men in the group had been unemployed due to the pandemic and had therefore agreed to travel to another state for work. Bijnor district magistrate Umesh Mishra said he has spoken to Kargil administration. “We have assured the families that we are initiating rescue efforts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/dumped-by-contractor-30-up-labourers-stranded-near-kargil-battle-cold-illness-authorities-plan-rescue-flight/articleshow/84387899.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Bijli Sakhi helping rural women||PRAYAGRAJ: Move to rely on women power to realise electricity dues from rural residents is paying off. Select groups of rural women engaged as ‘Bijli Sakhis’ (a state government’s initiative) has resulted in collection of power bills worth over Rs 49 lakh from rural areas of district. This amount has been realised from areas like Soraon, Koraon, Meja, Karchana, Mauaima and Pratappur development blocks in Prayagraj between February 1 and June 15 this year, despite the raging pandemic. Around 102 women working in ten groups managed to realise the whopping amount from 5,274 consumers, and in turn, earning Rs 2.5 lakh as commission for themselves. Ranjana, a 30-year-old resident of Dhokari village in Phulpur development block and mother of two kids aged 10 and 7, is busy doing her job as a bijlee sakhi these days. Every morning, she quickly finishes off the household chores and leaves for her government job. Starting from 10 am, Ranjana visits home after home walking long stretches under the scorching sun, reading electricity meters and generating bills on a smart device hanging around her neck. After collecting the billed amount, she deposits it at the local power department office on all working days. Having done her BA from a local degree college, this is the first time she has stepped out of her home to work and support her family, just like dozens of other women who too have been employed as bijli sakhis in Prayagraj. These women have been entrusted with the task of visiting rural homes, taking readings of the electricity metres and collecting the due amounts.  “After taking the responsibility of a bijli sakhi, I underwent a brief training on reading metres and generating power bills, and started working in August, 2020,” she added. “We had given training to 115 women to work as bijli sakhis in Prayagraj, and 102 out of them have already started reading electricity meters, generating bills and collecting due amounts. The fact that they have earned a commission of Rs 2.5 lakh for themselves in less than five months despite the Covid-19 is pandemic is worth applauding,” NRLM’s district mission manager, Amit Shukla said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bijli-sakhi-helping-rural-women/articleshow/84392458.cms||---

Considering the shortage of manpower to handle the crisis of this proportion, the district administration had decided to train 350 people in various aspects of patient care. However, they received close to 3,000 applications and therefore decided to enrol maximum applicants. They will trained by medical professionals in various Covid-related requirements like taking samples, measuring oxygen saturation, temperature and pulse rate, collating data and preparing reports, handling oxygen concentrators among other aspects. The government has already prepared for the possible third wave by creating more beds and installing oxygen plants. However, a manpower crunch is expected due to massive rush in government-run hospitals. District development Officer (DDO) VK Advani told TOI, “We are preparing a force of frontline workers because if the third wave strikes, we will require big manforce in hospitals. Though we are looking at training only 350, we decided to enroll all who applied. We will have a readymade list of trained manpower and would be able to recruit them on a temporary basis when need arises.” The training will be provided by the medical officers and other staff of district administration for the position of emergency medical technician, general duty assistant, home-health aide, medical equipment technology assistant and lab technician. Pooja Khara from Advana village who quit studies after HSC said, “I have started attending the training sessions for the last two days. They are teaching us in Gujarati and explaining medical terminology in a simplified language.”  They will also be trained theoretically and practically for identifying Covid symptoms and distinguishing them from malaria, swine flu and other respiratory illnesses.

Cial authorities said that some individuals, agencies and video production houses are operating drones in the district without obtaining prior permission from the authorities. Many such cases were being reported by the aircraft pilots who spotted the presence of drones while approaching the airport for landing. The airport operator approached the police seeking action against those operating drones without acquiring permission from the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA). Cial has issued a notice regarding the illegal flying of drone/UAVs within three kilometre perimeter of the airport. Cial has prepared a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the surveillance and detection of drones flying around the airport. The decision was taken at the annual aerodrome committee meeting held last week. The meeting convened by the district collector has sought opinion from various stakeholders, including officials of central industrial security force, DGCA and air traffic control (ATC), related to airport operations and safety. Sources said that ATC has raised the complaints by several pilots about the sightings of drones flying near the flight path dangerously. “The recent drone attack at the Indian Air force base in Jammu has prompted regulatory authorities to invoke the existing guidelines under the Unmanned Aircraft System Rules 2021 issued by the ministry of civil aviation, which restricts the flying of drones around an airport. As per the rules, the flying of any type of drone within 3km area from the perimeter wall of the airport is banned. The drone operator has to take prior permission from the authorities, including DGCA, for flying the drone beyond that area. Flying an unmanned aircraft over no operation area will attract a penalty of Rs 50,000. The main issue is the lack of awareness among the public about the security challenges and dangers posed by drones,” said Cial spokesperson. Another issue raised by the pilots was the use of laser lights and high beam spotlights which can imperil the aircraft, because it can disorient the pilot on takeoff or landing by making them temporarily blinded. These lights are flashed into the sky at night during celebrations or public events and could risk the safety of aircraft. “The airport operator has approached the police to issue a warning,” said a Cial statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cial-prepares-sop-to-monitor-drones-flying-around-airport/articleshow/84387955.cms||---

A team headed by senior inspector Jagannath Kalaskar and inspector Sangeeta Yadav of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police took the suspect, a resident of Sinhagad Road, into custody. The police have registered a case under section 443 (house-trespass) of the IPC and IT Act. “The suspect and the two women doctors are colleagues at a medical college in Dhankawadi and knew each other,” Kalaskar said. The suspect had installed two cameras — one each in the bathroom (fitted in a light bulb) and the bedroom (fitted in charger)— in the service quarter. The incident came to the light when one of the doctors tried to turn on a bulb in the bathroom but it did not illuminate. The electrician, who came to help the doctor, found the cameras. Following the incident, the doctor had registered an FIR. The spy cameras had memory cards and battery backup. “The identity of the suspect was revealed after we studied the footage recorded in the cameras. He had turned on one of the cameras and it had captured his footage,” Kalaskar said. “The police were probing how the professor got hold of the keys to enter the women’s service quarter, unlock the door, install the cameras and then lock them back again,” Kalaskar further added. Kalaskar said, “The suspect has been stalking the complainant’s colleague for the past few months without her knowledge and thus installed the spy cameras.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/medical-college-prof-held-for-installing-spy-cameras/articleshow/84392439.cms||---
---||Mumbai||State reprieve likely for 300 trees on Sewri-Worli connector route||MUMBAI: More than 300 trees marked out for hacking for the Sewri-Worli connector have got a new lease of life due to the newly amended Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act. The Act, which was amended in the previous week’s two-day monsoon session of the state legislature, states that all proposals for cutting more than 200 trees for any project must go to the Maharashtra State Tree Authority and not before the BMC’s Tree Authority. TimesViewThe fact that Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act has been amended in an attempt to protect the state’s green cover is welcome. However, the state must urgently constitute the state level tree authority and take suggestions and objections from citizens on various tree-cutting proposals such as for the Sewri-Worli connector. Efforts must be taken to ensure that only a minimum number of trees are hacked.This means the proposal to hack over 300 trees for MMRDA’s Sewri-Worli connector will have to be sent to the Maharashtra State Tree Authority and the proposal cannot be approved by the BMC’s Tree Authority, green activists have pointed out. “The Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act was amended recently. It states all proposals for felling over 200 trees must be sent to the state-level tree authority and not the BMC’s. So, notices issued by the BMC for hacking these trees must be withdrawn. As per the amended Act, only the state government can issue notes and hear suggestions/objections for proposals where over 200 trees are to be hacked,” said green activist Zoru Bhathena. More than 550 trees will be felled and transplanted for the upcoming Sewri-Worli connector that will connect Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) and a proposed redevelopment project at Worli. The BMC’s garden department last week issued a public notice inviting suggestions and objections for felling 329 trees. Apart from them, 123 trees are to be transplanted.  MMRDA started construction of MTHL in 2018. The 21.8km-long six-lane road over-bridge is expected to halve travel time between Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. The implementation of the Act was transferred from the urban development (UD) department to the environment department too. “Its true the Tree Act has been amended. So we will take suggestions/objections from citizens and then ask MMRDA to try and reduce the number of trees that are to be cut. If they are less than 200, we will take a call or then this proposal will have to be sent to the state government. We will inform MMRDA accordingly,” said a BMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-reprieve-likely-for-300-trees-on-sewri-worli-connector-route/articleshow/84392508.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

One such project is the Kanihar City Lake project which will be developed in a joint effort of Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Prayagraj Development Authority (PDA). Proposed in an area of 65.68 hectares (over 6,50,000 square metres) of the vacant land near Jhunsi and Andawa villages, hardly a few kilometres from the heart of Sangam city, the Kanihar City Lake project will soon become the favourite picnic spot for the residents of the city. While the PDA is going to develop the forest using the Miyawaki technique, the PMC is gearing up to hire a consultant and work on rejuvenating the existing lake at the site. Once ready, Kanihar City Lake forest will act as a getaway site for city residents and a must-visit spot for tourists. Although not an essential part of the mega project, PDA has floated a tender to develop the forest in two hectares of land near the natural lake of Kanihar in two months. On its part, PMC will soon prepare a detailed project report (DPR) and submit the same for getting the required funds. “With the help of experts, we will renovate the Kanihar Lake area of Jhunsi. PMC will take help of expert architects and consultants who will soon be hired,” said chief engineer of PMC, Satish Kumar. Kumar further said that the lake is spread over a large area and PMC plans to develop as a centre of tourism. To make the lake and its surroundings more attractive, PMC also plans to build cottages around the lake wherein visitors could come and stay for a few days. Before the renovation, a boundary will be constructed around the lake to protect it from encroachment. Few months back, municipal commissioner Ravi Ranjan and the chief engineer had inspected the lake. The Kanihar lake which is to be developed is around 3 kilometres from the Ganga. If everything goes according to plan, the project is expected to be complete before the start of Kumbh, 2025. The approach road to the proposed site has already been constructed. A wall of around 4.5 km is proposed around the lake so that it remains completely protected. After this, the main gate will be constructed on GT Road, along with two more gates on the approach roads. Rohit Khanna, superintendent engineer of PDA said, “PDA is preparing a proposal and the same will be sent to the government for the first phase. There will be very little concrete construction in the plan and the site will have a natural pathway made of grass with natural landscapes on either sides, playing area for kids, an open gymnasium, boating facility, etc.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/kanihar-lake-project-to-come-up-in-city-before-maha-kumbh-2025/articleshow/84392514.cms||---

Health officials claimed that the vaccination was being discontinued due to Mamta Diwas (vaccination day for new-born) that is observed every Wednesday as per instruction by the state health department. The health workers involved in Covid-19 vaccination are involved during the Mamta Diwas. On July 7, 8 and 9, Covid-19 vaccination was suspended across the Diamond City. Surat city is getting around 16,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine daily against its capacity of inoculating 30,000 people every day. Earlier the city was receiving 20,000 doses daily. “Every Wednesday on Mamta Diwas vaccination will not take place as per the state government’s orders. On this day routine immunisation will be done,” said a health official. Meanwhile, hundreds of people waiting for the second dose and those trying to get the first dose queue up daily at the vaccination centres. Many of them have to return disappointed as there is limited stock at each centre. With prior registration not mandatory, people have to wait for hours to take the shot. At some vaccination centres in Surat, people had queued up as early as 5 am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/vaccination-suspended-for-fourth-time-in-last-7-days/articleshow/84385628.cms||---
---||Delhi||N corpn looks for pvt hands for upkeep of toilets||New Delhi: North Delhi Municipal Corporation will hand over 110 community toilet complexes to private companies for maintenance and operation under a seven-year contract. It has been decided to charge men a user fee of Rs 5 for all facilities other than urinals while keeping everything free for women and children. “To provide convenient and hygienic services to the general public and at the same time generate some revenue, we have taken the decision. After seven years, these complexes will be handed back to the municipal corporation in a proper working condition. In case of repair, the same will need to be repaired within two months,” said the official. A tender has been issued to select the companies. According to the tender notice, “The civic body will charge a user fee @Rs 5 for using toilet and bath facility from gents only. The toilet and bath facility (if available) will be free for ladies and children below the age of 14 years. There will be no charges for urinals.” The corporation has 298 community toilets in its jurisdiction and, of them, 165 were allotted to contractors on pay-use basis, the official said. “That means Rs 5 for using the toilet facility was charged from visitors but the rest 133 were free for all.” Now that the contract for 110 out of the 133 toilet complexes is over, “we decided to charge a minimal amount from users, which is why a fresh tender has been issued. For the remaining toilets, a decision will be taken after their contract gets over”, the official added. The toilet complexes have been divided into clusters of seven to 12 and the clusters will be outsourced. “It has been decided that these 110 toilet complexes will be allocated on a cluster basis with a maximum of 12 toilets in a lot. The work will be allotted on the basis of highest quoted rates. In case of any lapses, there is a provision for termination of the contract,” stated the notice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-looks-for-pvt-hands-for-upkeep-of-toilets/articleshow/84390374.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Chandigarh||Industries moving out, joblessness rising in Haryana, says ex-CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda||CHANDIGARH: Former Haryana CM and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda has blamed the BJP-JJP government for rising unemployment in the state. He said Haryana is consistently topping the country in terms of unemployment as several big projects have been shifted out of the state. “The June report released by CMIE has also confirmed that Haryana is once again on top with an unemployment rate of 27.9%. The unemployment rate of Haryana is almost three times higher than the national average. Haryana is ahead of states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh in unemployment,” he said. Hooda said many big projects have been going out of Haryana over the last seven years due to the negative attitude of the BJP government. “Meham airport and Sonipat Rail Coach Factory (RCF) were moved to other states and the state government remained silent. The government did not pay any attention to the development of IMTs set up in Rohtak, Nuh, Kharkhoda and Faridabad during the Congress’s tenure. All possibilities of industrial development and employment in the state have stopped under this government,” he said. The former CM said Haryana had made historic progress in the industrial sector during his term in office. “The state was number one in per-capita income and per-capita investment and many national-level projects were established in Haryana during this period. The state’s industrial sector has been able to provide employment to lakhs of people, not only from Haryana but from other parts of the country,” he added. Hooda said industrial growth has been hit as industries are continuously migrating from Haryana due to the policies of the current government. “Many big companies, including Maruti, are now expanding their operations in Gujarat or Uttar Pradesh, instead of Haryana. Big projects like HMT at Panchkula are being closed by the government. The adverse effect of the closure of these units is felt on the ancillary industries associated with these large industries,” he said. “The impact of shifting and closure of industries has been amplified as most recruitments of this government have been left hanging on one pretext or another. To make matters worse, investment in the private sector is also decreasing. Employment opportunities for the youth in both government and private sectors are getting exhausted. If the state government does not take serious action on the issue of unemployment, the situation is going to get worse in the coming months,’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/industries-moving-out-joblessness-rising-in-haryana-says-ex-cm-hooda/articleshow/84390340.cms||---

According to officials, the blast occurred in the receiving tank. The operator of the plant, Prashant Kumar, sustained minor injury in the eye. The explosion was so powerful that parts of the plant flew in the air and landed several metres away. There was a panic among staffers and patients present on the premises of the hospital. The oxygen plant was being set up with the financial help of former MP Kanwar Singh Tanwar. With a production capacity of 666.7 litres per minute, the plant will supply oxygen to 150 beds. A Delhi-based company is constructing the plant. According to Amroha’s additional district magistrate, Vinay Kumar Singh, “A technical team of the company concerned will inspect the plant to know the cause of the blast in the oxygen plant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/2-days-before-inauguration-oxygen-plant-in-amroha-damaged-in-blast-operator-injured/articleshow/84387953.cms||Harveer Dabas

Their death has left the family devastated. The bodies were consigned to flames in Amritsar on Tuesday. TOI spoke to the family living at Vrindavan Vihar 2, near Bagadon ka Bad in Sanganer area. “I am very upset with news reports that claimed Shivani was to get married and that both Amit and Shivani had come to Jaipur on a bike. My mother Lavanya Lata Sharma (68) had a fracture in her thigh last year and she has been bed-ridden since then. Amit and Shivani were keen to meet her as Covid cases had dipped. They took a train from Amritsar on July 8 and reached here on July 9 morning,” Rakesh Sharma, their cousin said. Recounting the day of the accident, Rakesh said, “For a change, they wanted to visit the Walled City. My cousin was a bike enthusiast and he requested to take my Bullet bike. They left home at 1.30pm and explored Jal Mahal, Hawa Mahal, Nahargarh before reaching Amber. In the evening, torrential rainfall started in Jaipur and we were worried. We got a call from Amit. He told us about the lightning and Shivani’s death. When my wife called after a few minutes, someone else answered Amit’s phone and informed us that he was no more.” Rakesh, along with some neighbours, went to Amber watch tower and identified Amit and Shivani after seeing some pictures clicked on the mobile phone. “We have had sleepless nights. We got their bodies on Monday, which reached Amritsar’s Bhalla colony on Tuesday morning. It is hard to believe that both have left us,” said Rakesh. “Abhi to unka luggage bhi humare ghar pada hai (Their luggage is still with us),” he added. Rakesh said that Amit and Shivani are survived by their parents, brother Vishal and sister Prateeksha Sharma. “Someone wrote that they had no money for tickets so they came on bike. Let me tell you that my brother was a bike enthusiast and had the best of racing bikes. I request everyone not to defame the dead,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/siblings-cremated-in-amritsar-devastated-kin-recalls-last-days/articleshow/84390375.cms||Ashish Mehta

Once diagnosed, the now-recovered teenager was put on a seven-day course of immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory injections to alleviate her excruciating abdominal pain in June. Paedertician Dr Avinash Gawande said it is a rare combination of HS purpura and post-Covid complication. The disorder is mostly seen in children below seven. HS purpura is Idiopathic — when the cause of a disease is not known. It is mostly happens when immunity is low. “Documentation of more cases and study is required to ascertain its prevalence among Covid recovered patients,” he said. In June first week, the patient was admitted to a private hospital for 10 days and investigated for dengue, urine infection, Covid, malarial antigen, blood tests including CBC. Still undetected, her parents took her to Dr Gawande after another five days of discharge. Interestingly, the teenager was Covid negative when some family members tested positive in April-May, Dr Gawande said. At last, Dr Gawande prescribed an antibody test which turned out positive. “She had history of vomiting, abdominal pain, and greenish stool. Except Total Leukocyte Count (TLC) which was 15,400 all tests were normal. Gastroscopy and biopsy too had been done before coming to me. The abdomen pain didn’t subside while she also had developed mild rash on lower limbs. HRCT and abdomen scan were also normal. Hence, I prescribed Covid antibody test which turned out to be positive,” he said. Dr Gawande added, “As she was Covid recovered patient, it can be concluded that the Covid precipitated HS purpura. The abdomen pain was due to HS purpura. Several viral infections have been attributed as triggering factor for HS purpura. In this case, HS purpura diagnosis was confirmed. To see its association with Covid, the antibody test was done. This is a rare combination. The post-Covid status is reason for HS purpura.” Asked about the long duration taken for diagnosis, Dr Gawande said sometimes the symptoms show up late. “Initially, she was admitted for evaluation for abdomen pain and gastritis due to vomiting. Later, I treated her on OPD basis and injected methylprednisolone — an anti-inflammatory immunosuppressant — one each for seven days. So far doctors have not come across any other case of HS purpura among Covid recovered patients in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-a-rare-case-hs-purpura-triggers-post-covid-abodomen-pain-in-teenager/articleshow/84390400.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Giri put forward the demand to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat, whom he met in Chitrakoot on Monday. ABAP is the apex-decision making body of the 13 recognised Hindu religious akharas or monastic orders of the country. “On behalf of ABAP, I have demanded from Bhagwat that the Parishad should be included in the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. Further, two jagatgurus and mahants of the three Ani akharas of ABAP were made ex-officio members of the trust. Along with this, ABAP president and general secretary should be included in the Trust as members,” Giri told TOI on Tuesday. “Apart from demanding inclusion of prominent seers in the trust, we have told Bhagwat that soon different groups of seers of ABAP would visit various parts of the country and spread awareness against rising cases of religious conversion,” said Giri. “We have also demanded that a strong policy should be made to stop this evil of religious conversion following which, those who try to change their religion because of greed or under influence and lure, should be stopped,” he added. Giri claimed that Bhagwat informed him that though RSS does not interfere in the matters of the Trust, he would make sure that ABAP demand “definitely reaches the government”. On this occasion, the Parishad president extended blessings of Lord Hanuman to the RSS chief. Other office-bearers of the Sangh were also present on this occasion. Incidentally, RSS leaders are holding a brainstorming session at Chitrakoot to chalk out the future course of Sangh activities. The 13 akharas of the country comprise three ‘anis’ which are Digambar Ani (group of three akharas), Nirvani Ani (seven akharas) and Nirmohi Ani (also called Udasin and is a group of three akharas).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/abap-demands-inclusion-in-ayodhya-temple-trust/articleshow/84392563.cms||Rajeev Mani

Gopalakrishnan stated that had rented the building at Tallakulam to set up an office during his tenure as MP in 2014. On March 19, a flying squad had inspected his office and removed the banners in front of the office and sealed it. He stated that a case was registered by the Tallakulam police under Sections of Tamil Nadu Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement Act) Act. After the assembly election was completed and the model code of conduct was lifted, he had submitted several representations to the authorities to remove the lock and seal of the building, however, no steps were taken. Hence, he moved the HC Madurai bench seeking relief. Justice N Anand Venkatesh observed that a careful reading of the resolution passed by the corporation shows that the property was allotted to petitioner in his capacity as MP to utilise the space as an office to perform public function. “Once the petitioner ceases to be the MP, he loses his right to occupy the property. The petitioner does not have a vested right to continue to be in possession of property,” observed the judge. Hence, the judge observed that the court is not inclined to issue any directions as prayed for by the petitioner and dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mp-or-mla-must-not-squat-on-public-property-hc/articleshow/84388051.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Psychologist, aide held for selling hash brownie cakes||MUMBAI: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Monday arrested a consulting psychologist with a south Mumbai hospital and his associate for allegedly baking and selling hashish and opium brownie cakes. Based on a tipoff, the NCB raided clinical psychologist Dr Rahmeen Charaniya’s Mazgaon residence and seized 10kg of hashish brownie cakes, 320gm of opium and over Rs 1.7 lakh cash. He spilled the beans on his accomplice, Ramzan Shaikh, who was arrested from Crawford Market area. Nearly 50gm of hashish was found on him, said officials. Dr Charaniya would source weed and hashish from Sheikh and other local peddlers, said officials. During interrogation, Dr Charaniya said that since the NCB busted the gang from Orlem last month, he was getting lots of calls for brownie weed pot cakes. He said he charged between Rs 75,000 to Rs 1 lakh per kg of cake and most of his clients were women, said NCB officials. On June 12, the NCB raided a home bakery at Orlem, Malad, and arrested three people for allegedly baking and selling brownie weed pot cakes. The police said it is baffling why Dr Charaniya, who is pursuing his PhD and comes from a well-to-do family, would supply the drug-infused brownie cakes. “Dr Charaniya, being from the medical fraternity, should know the impact of these drugs on youngsters. Ingesting cannabis and hashish is one of the most powerful ways to abuse cannabis-based drugs and products. The effect lasts for at least six hours,” said Sameer Wankhede, zonal director of NCB. The arrested duo has been booked under the NDPS Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-psychologist-aide-held-for-selling-hash-brownie-cakes/articleshow/84394353.cms||Ahmed Ali

Between April and June, Thiruvananthapuram officially recorded 1,910 Covid-19 deaths and around 1,430 bodies were cremated at Santhikavadom in three months. Special team comprising 37 employees took shifts to operate four wood pyres, two electrical furnaces and two gas crematoriums for hours to deal with the surge in Covid fatalities. In May alone, Santhikavadom recorded 901 Covid-19 cremations and by June, the number had dropped to 430. “When we saw the fatalities climbing, we formed a special team exclusively for coordinating with hospitals for cremation of bodies. Health officials were also posted at hospitals where the fatalities were high. There were nodal officers in hospitals who would communicate data on deaths to the main office. This eased the burden on relatives of Covid-19 victims. Right from booking, the corporation team was able to handle transportation and cremation,” said city corporation secretary Binu Francis. Laisoning with other ambulance agencies and nearby crematoriums was the next step. “In addition to our ambulances, corporation took four other ambulances on rent and this reduced the hassles of transportation. As Covid deaths began to increase, we were able to network with other crematoriums to divert non-Covid deaths. Community crematoriums played a key role in dealing with the crisis,” said Shaji M S, corporation charge officer, Santhikavadom. Former charge officer Sujith and two other junior health inspectors were dealing with 40 to 45 bodies on a daily basis when the second wave was peaking in the district. This also called for immense logistic support. As much as 30 gas cylinders were always kept in stock at the crematorium. The cylinders with a capacity of 19.5kg would be supplied daily by an agency. It was estimated that cremation of one body would require a cylinder and a half. Depending upon the need, 15 to 20 cylinders arrived at Santhikavadom daily without fail. When there were protests in some of the crematoriums, corporation again began to direct all the bodies to Santhikavadom to mitigate the tension. “We also deployed our team to travel long distances and transport the body for cremation. It was a non-stop exercise. Everything was promptly updated on WhatsApp group which included public relations officers of all the hospitals which handled Covid cases,” said Francis. “As of July, one of the electrical crematoriums has been shut for maintenance. This will be operational after 10 days. The death load has dropped drastically. Now, we are able to handle non-Covid deaths as well. During the second wave, cremation fee was waived for many families with poor financial background,” said Francis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/1430-covid-victims-cremated-at-santhikavadom-in-3-months/articleshow/84388102.cms||Aswin J Kumar

A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi ordered notice on the public interest litigation filed by A Stephen Lobo, a Naam Tamilar Katchi functionary from Tuticorin district. The petitioner stated that the authorities who are carrying out the process of laying roads from Tiruchendur to Ambasamudram under the Chennai - Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor Project are cutting trees along the stretch. Several of these trees are over 100 years old. Since the temple at Tiruchendur is one of the six abodes of Lord Muruga, several devotees visit from southern districts. The trees protect these devotees from the scorching sun. He also suggested that since the trees are several years old, authorities could consider transplanting them. Since there was no action taken on his representation, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-plant-10-saplings-for-every-tree-facing-axe/articleshow/84388084.cms||---

Officials from police, forest and other departments, along with locals and members of Adventure Tour Operators Association (ATOA), Manali, were succesful in fundung the missing woman’s body. In spite of the incident, a large number of tourists had been making a beeline for Hamta Pass. Some had permission from forest department, but others were trekking illegally. Officials sent back the trekkers to Manali after a warning. The department of tourism on Monday had issued an alert that all adventure activities, including rafting, paragliding and trekking, shall remain suspended for two days due to inclement weather conditions. The department has also imposed two-month ban on all adventure activities from July 15. ATOA officials say local operators are following government orders, but companies from other states are ignoring warning. District tourism development officer Krishan Chand said all adventure activities had been suspended with immediate effect on Monday and Tuesday, following inclement weather forecast by IMD. “All activities will be banned from July 15 to September 15 as precautionary measures during monsoon season. Strict legal action will be taken against those not adhering to the orders,” he said. ATOA Manali president Ravi Thakur said large companies from many other states were organising mass treks in the region. “They have turned serene mountains into towns. They organise treks for groups of 50 or more, which is more like a yatra, not adventure. They do not follow safety procedures. They do not know about mountaineering. Also, 90% trekking in the region is being organised by unprofessional, large companies. When their clients are in trouble, we go for their rescue,” he said. Thakur said they will not allow mass trekking in the area. “We have to promote safe and eco-friendly adventure activities. These companies are here only to earn money at the cost of environment and precious lives. We reached Hamta on Monday evening to search for the missing trekker. We were surprised to see that trekking was happening even at night. Trekkers walking in large groups broke our hearts. We shall now fight for streamlining trekking with proper safety procedures and won’t allow anybody to destroy environment,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/near-manali-400-trekkers-sent-back-for-ignoring-weather-warning/articleshow/84390513.cms||---

WRD assistant engineer overlooking the dam Jason Menezes attributed the reason for the delayed overflow to the dry spell in catchment areas such as Netravali and the surrounding areas, last week. Last year, water began overflowing from the dam on the evening of July 9. WRD executive engineer Krishnakant Patil said Sanguem recorded 1,284mm rainfall until Tuesday morning, which is 342mm less as compared to last year’s 1,626mm on the same date. “The phenomenon is likely to last until November, depending on the intensity of rainfall in the areas constituting the dam’s catchment. The excess water flows into the Selaulim river and is used for irrigation,” Patil told TOI. The dam’s full reservoir level (FRL) is 41.15m. Sources said its unique ‘duckbill’ spillway is designed to release a maximum flood discharge of 1,450cum per second. Of the total live storage of 226.8cum, 126cum are used for irrigation and the balance is earmarked for domestic and industrial use. The PWD treats about 160 million litres per day (MLD) of water and another JAICAsponsored water treatment plant treats around 100MLD water, which is supplied to Sanguem, Quepem, Salcete and Mormugao talukas and part of Ponda taluka, including Borim village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/selaulim-dam-fills-up-overflows-from-crest/articleshow/84392703.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

But it is a matter of great pride when a Gujarati civilian can leave his or her imprint on the forces’ strength. Meet Vispy Kharadi, who holds seven Guinness World Records, and a martial art trainer from the Diamond City who is training Border Security Force, Indian’s first line of defense, on world’s most lethal fighting technique — Krav Maga. This format of combat skills was developed for the Israel Defence Forces. Kharadi has conducted two training sessions at BSF training institutes in Tekanpur of Madhya Pradesh and Hazaribagh in Jharkhand so far. And, all pro bono service! The ‘Sensei’ refused to accept fees for the training. The first director general of BSF, K F Rustamji, was a Parsi like Kharadi. Rustamji has been awarded Padma Bhushan for his exemplary services and is claimed to be the only police officer in country that has been honoured with the second highest civilian award till now. “There is nothing prouder than training the same force which had a Parsi as its first DG,” said Kharadi, adding that he feels honoured to train the BSF jawans. “At present only National Security Guard jawans get Krav-Maga training and that too directly from Israel,” he added. “I am trying to train Krav-Maga and Kudo to the jawans as they require this form of fighting skills while on border,” said Kharadi. The first phase of training for BSF commando units and jawans has already been completed. But their training for multiple phases will continue. Kharadi does not teach Krav-Maga skills to civilians as it is the most lethal form of combat skills. “As part of my women self-defence training sessions, I, however, use some of it tactics,” he said. Explaining Krav-Maga, Kharadi said that the speciality of this form is that it trains individual for armed and unarmed combat. “I am also taking training for various levels of this form and my trainer is trained in Israel from experts,” he said, refusing to divulge different segments of training for professional secrecy. The jawans are trained for stress inoculation training as well to manage panic in a better way. “Some of our jawans are posted in disturbed civilian areas as well hence we train them to protect themselves in mob attacks,” said Kharadi, who acted in few Bollywood movies as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/gujarati-trains-bsf-with-combat-skills/articleshow/84385763.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

A BJP legislature team will leave for Delhi to submit the same memorandum to the President and the Lok Sabha speaker. Roy, who won the assembly election on a BJP ticket, was made PAC chairman a few weeks after he returned to TMC. By convention, the post goes to an opposition member. “The speaker has flouted the rules and procedures of conduct of business in the Bengal assembly. He could have chosen anyone from the six names BJP had provided to him for PAC chairman’s post. We recommended renowned economist Ashok Lahiri’s name. But he tagged Mukul Roy’s name as one from BJP when we hadn’t sent his name,” Adhikari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-mlas-quit-panels-in-protest-as-mukul-roy-gets-pac-chiefs-post/articleshow/84395632.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh: Man ends life a day after killing daughter for ‘honour’’||KANPUR: A man ended his life on Tuesday in Kaimganj Kotwali police area of Farrukhabad district, a day after killing his daughter apparently for family honour. Sensation prevailed in the area after the body of the man accused of killing his teenage daughter was found hanging from a tree in an orchard in Kaimganj area on Tuesday morning. The man had on Monday morning allegedly stabbed his only daughter, who as per locals, was insisting on marrying her lover, to death. He has been on the run since then. The police were on the lookout for the accused man. However, after finding his body hanging from a tree, the police prima-facie believed that he hanged himself to death after killing the daughter for honour. Police have registered a case and started investigation into the matter. Vinod Kumar Jatav, whose wife had passed away a few years ago, used to live with his two children including minor son Ankit and teenage daughter Shivani in Lahra Raza Kulipur village of Kaimganj Kotwali police area of the district. His two elder sons Sanjeev and Ankesh work outside. On Monday morning, Vinod had an altercation with his only daughter Shivani, who was adamant on marrying her lover. Shivani had even tried to seek police help by dialling PRV 112. The police rushed to the spot and pacified the matter between the father and the daughter. As per the villagers, as soon as policemen left their place, Vinod stabbed Shivani to death and fled thereafter. On the complaint of the village head Atul Yadav, the police reached the spot and launched a search for Vinod by registering a case against him. The police were searching for him when on Tuesday morning the villagers came across Vinod’s body hanging from a tree in a nearby orchard. On being informed, a police team arrived and initiated investigations after taking the body into custody. The police said that he had used his scarf to hang himself. “As per villagers, Shivani was adamant on marrying her lover and her father Vinod used to oppose their relationship,” said the police. A police official said that Vinod had even tried to make the incident look like suicide after the murder of his daughter Shivani. “We found a knife stuck in Shivani’s hands. However, there was no blood on her hand and knife. Later, we had recovered another blood-stained knife from another place in the house,” said the official further. “Body of Vinod has been sent for postmortem. We are probing the incident from every possible angle,”said SP Farrukhabad Ashok Kumar Meena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/man-ends-life-a-day-after-killing-daughter-for-honour/articleshow/84392672.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Though the pandemic may have hit all-round activity, murders involving rowdy elements have come down from 11 in 2019 and five last year to nil so far, according to the data furnished by the police. They say that deploying teams armed with firearms in rowdyism-prone areas has worked. The cops had introduced this measure after a 22-year-old youth was brutally murdered by a gang in full public view in an arterial road near Madurai’s iconic St Mary’s church last November. His head being decapitated was captured on phone by a traveller, which went viral on social media. Following the beheading incident, the city police deployed 16 teams of personnel with firearms at various station limits including Teppakulam, Avaniyapuram, Keerathurai, Anna Nagar, S S Colony, Jaihindpuram, Karimedu, Sellur and Koodalpudur, considered as rowdyism-prone. Young policemen trained in handling weapons were chosen. They were given two-wheelers and pistols and a free hand to open fire at rowdy elements. However, though the number of violent incidents involving rowdies has dipped, the number of murders due to family dispute or sudden provocation has not. “Armed patrol team deployment has helped in curbing murders due to rivalry between gangs and restored peace in the rowdyism-prone areas. Many rowdy elements have gone underground and left Madurai fearing police action,” city police commissioner Prem Anand Sinha said. Actions like detaining such elements under goondas act and executing bonds under CrPc sections have also helped curb the activities of rowdy elements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/armed-patrol-has-curbed-gang-wars-cops/articleshow/84388149.cms||V Devanathan

Party workers from Beed gathered in large numbers and some even submitted resignations, which were rejected. Pankaja on Sunday had attended the meeting of BJP national secretaries and later met PM Narendra Modi and party’s national president J P Nadda. “I met Modi to discuss organisational issues,” she said. “I conveyed to Nadda that people are upset and submitting resignations. He said he was confident I would be able to soothe them. Leaders in Delhi are not out to finish me (political career)...I may not be a cabinet minister, but I am a Rashtriya (national) leader,” she said. Pankaja used the opportunity to assert she was not leaving BJP. “We have built this house with hardwork and sweat. We sh-ould not leave our house. If the roof comes down (I) will decide wh-at to do next.” Referring to her st-ruggle as a ‘dharmayuddha’, she said she was trying hard to avoid it. Pankaja said the sisters were not upset over Bhagwan Karad being made a cabinet minister. “I am not greedy for power nor do I lust for the chair. I never laid claim to the CM’s post; I want to fulfill my father’s dream to ensure the CM is from BJP.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sidelined-munde-sisters-stage-show-of-strength-in-mumbai-mcity/articleshow/84394402.cms||---

The NGO which has been working with women and adolescent girls in the Usilampatti on a project said this has become a problem during the second wave. Its executive director, S Selva Gomathy, said many girls told her that in the past they had been getting sanitary pads provided by the government from schools. But with the schools remaining closed for more than a year, they could not afford it. ``We have been working hard to make women and girls use sanitary pads but now the Covid crisis has taken them back to the age-old unhygienic practices of using old cloth or other materials during menstruation,’’ she said. The government should ensure that sanitary pads which are essential commodities are provided to the girls, at least through the local PHCs and even PDS shops, during a crisis period like this, she added. The foundation has been interacting with women who hailed from villages including Ezhumalai, Kottaipatti, Solapuram, Parayampatti, Vepampatti, Chellayeepuram, Uthapuram and Thirumanickam who worked in garment industries and mills in the region. This was to ensure decent working conditions and securing a living wage for them. Gomathy said that in their project being undertaken jointly with Action Aid and John Lewis Foundation, they had found that the women and adolescent girls had been more impacted by the second Covid wave. During the first wave, they had at least got some wages from the owners, but not now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/shut-schools-denying-sanitary-napkins-to-girls-in-villages/articleshow/84388208.cms||---

After Radhanagari taluka announced strict lockdown of fourteen days, now nineteen villages from Shahuwadi tehsil and one village ‘Bazar Bhogaon’ from Panhala tehsil have implemented strict lockdown with only emergency services allowed to stay operational. Shahuwadi tehsildar Guru Birajdar said, “Under the Epidemic Diseases Act (1897), strict lockdown has been implemented in these villages for fourteen days from Tuesday and the notification has been issued to the nodal officers and the gram panchayat samiti. They have been asked to strictly implement the lockdown and to take strict action against those found violating the lockdown.” Birajdar said these villages have been asked to shut the roads connecting to the villages and only one major road for emergency will be kept open. Only emergency services, milk and medicine shops are allowed to operate, along with farming activities. All the non-essential shops and businesses will remain closed till further orders. “While the administration is taking efforts to control the pandemic, the villagers are seen not following any of the Covid safety precautions. Mask, sanitization and social distancing measures are not being followed properly in the rural parts and hence, the cases are rising in the Shahuwadi region,” he said, adding that if the villagers start following ‘Early detection, early treatment’ then the cases can come down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/19-villages-in-shahuwadi-one-in-panhala-under-strict-lockdown/articleshow/84390592.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Mini Khare, 29, who is an MBA graduate and runs an NGO named Jeev Asray Samiti, recalls how she got a rescue call from someone in February about a puppy lying in a miserable condition on Gwalior road. Sherry was rescued in February with burn marks.As she reached the spot along with her team members, she found a female puppy who was completely blind and had burn marks on her face. The dog, whom they later on named Sherry, was taken to a veterinary doctor and her bruises were treated. “After Sherry recovered, the biggest worry for us was to find a home for her, as we did not have a proper shelter where she could live and be looked after,” says Mini whose love for animals inspired her to open the non-profit, Jeev Asray Samiti in 2019. As a result, Mini started a social media campaign to find a suitable adopter. Her efforts led her to a veterinary doctor from Delhi, Dr Premlata Choudhery, who in turn, contacted one Helen Brown in Pennsylvania City, US, who runs an NGO for stray animals. Thereafter, Sherry was brought to Delhi where she was further treated and finally sent to Pennsylvania. Here, Sherry was formally adopted on Monday, and given a new and secure life. So far, Mini has rescued around 300 stray animals, all because of her soft corner for them since childhood.

There are 773 families residing in Nota village with a total population of 4,523, of which 2,447 are above 18. Out of the 2,447 adults, 1,457 are in the age group of 18 to 44, and 990 are above 44 years of age. Besides, 966 out of the 2,447 adults are women, and the rest 1,481 are men. Talking to TOI, Jhansi DM Andra Vamsi said, “It is a great achievement that not a single dose of the vaccine received by the gram panchayat remained unused. During the initial period, many kinds of misconceptions, hesitancy and fear were prevalent among the villagers regarding the vaccination.” “The village monitoring committee constituted by the district administration ran programmes to allay fears of the villagers by spreading public awareness. We had also involved FPOs, self-help groups and other volunteer organisations to carry out these awareness programmes,” he added. Vamsi extended his thanks to the surveillance committee, ASHA, ANM and Anganwadi workers, other volunteer organisations and the villagers who showed their courage and willingness to get vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/nota-feat-all-villagers-receive-1st-jab-against-covid/articleshow/84392755.cms||Arindam Ghosh

Each ward would be divided into seven blocks and 10-member teams will be deployed to visit houses and institutions for source-level reduction. A register shall be maintained in which reports on source-level reduction will be recorded. Seven blocks will be covered within a week. Health inspectors and junior health inspectors shall identify owners of plots with overgrown grass and notice shall be served to such persons. Mosquito breeding spots shall be identified and eradication measures shall be undertaken in scrap shops, punctured tyre repair shops, tender coconut vending shops and the like, the action plan states. Mass fogging shall also be carried out such places. Meanwhile, the special council which dragged on for nearly five hours saw veteran councillor Palayam Rajan taking on health officials for their absence in the council meeting. One of the senior health officials had to leave following a personal emergency and with no other official attending the meeting, Rajan called it an act of serious negligence. He said that the mayor should censure such officials and the demand was backed by opposition councillors also. Earlier, BJP councillors’ scavenger remark also triggered a row in the special council. While pointing out lapses in clearing of garbage piles in the city, a BJP councillor derisively remarked that councillors have to do the work of scavengers. LDF councillors steadfastly objected to the way the BJP councillor dishonoured a group of people engaged in a particular profession. The councillor later withdrew the remark. The action plan for mosquito eradication will be implemented from July 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ward-level-action-plan-gets-councils-nod/articleshow/84388318.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||Mortality low, but 20% black fungus patients lost eye or jaw: Lucknow doctors||LUCKNOW: Nearly 20% of patients suffering from mucormycosis or black fungus at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) either lost an eye or one of the jaws or palate, as per an analysis of 390 patients admitted to the varsity from May end to first week of July. Apart from affecting vision, chewing and swallowing abilities and facial aesthetics, the disease may impact self-esteem and leave a psychological scar in these patients, said doctors. Though an artificial eye can be implanted for normal facial appearance, vision cannot be restored. Similarly, artificial substitutes and reconstructive surgeries for jaws and palates are available, but that too will not make life as normal as it was before, they added. As many as 423 critical patients were brought to KGMU from end of May to July 7 from various districts of UP. Of these, 33 patients were referred to other hospitals, while 92% (362) of the remaining 390 had to undergo surgical interventions for removal of tissues infected by the fungus. An eye of 14 patients who underwent surgeries had to be taken out by doctors to save their lives. Similarly, an upper or lower jaw or palate of 60 other patients was removed. In the rest, debridement surgeries were done to clean the infected and dead tissues from the sinus. Overall, 74 mucormycosis patients lost a facial/oral cavity feature. About 54 (14%) patients died during the course of treatment. The deceased included 14 who underwent surgeries. The rest (40) came at the last stage of the disease and died before any surgery could be done. However, doctors have managed to save the lives of many patients. The fatality rate of mucormycosis is up to 50%, but in KGMU it has been only 14% so far. While 110 patients have been discharged after substantial recovery due to the treatment, 226 are still under treatment. “ We will have to do regular follow up to ensure that the infection does not resurface,” said Dr D Himanshu, Medical Superintendent, KGMU. “It will take time for patients to bear the loss. The replacement of artificial substitutes can begin once the patient has stabilised after the surgery,” he added. Since most patients have diabetes and are immunocompromised, they need to strictly control blood sugar. They should also avoid places with high moisture and always wear a mask, said doctors. Ophthalmologist Dr Sandeep Saxena said, “Eye removal surgery is performed only when mucormycosis damages tissues of the entire organ. Only cosmetic eyes can be implanted to maintain a normal appearance.” Head of oral maxillofacial surgery, Prof Shadab Mohammad said that in almost all the debridement surgeries of oral cavity, dead tissues, including teeth, jaw and hard and soft palate, are removed. “We follow patients for five to six months after surgery for any possibility of resurfacing of infection before going for reconstructive surgeries using bones and muscle tissue from thigh and pelvic region.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mortality-low-but-20-black-fungus-patients-lost-eye-or-jaw-kgmu-docs/articleshow/84392807.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Patna||Bihar: IMA members adopt villages for awareness about immunisation||PATNA: Doctors under the aegis of Indian Medical Association (IMA) state branch has come forward to boost the ongoing immunisation drive against the Covid pandemic by adopting villages, mobilise people of 18 years and above and also make them aware of Covid appropriate behaviour for saving the humanity. The IMA state branch in its meeting held on July 4 had decided that each member would adopt at least two villages with an objective to help their people getting immunised and providing other help. About 20 villages have already been adopted in different districts by Tuesday but the number is likely to cross a thousand mark by the weekend. IMA national president elect Dr Sahjanand Prasad Singh has adopted three villages in Nalanda. They are Lodipur, Amawan and Jakhaur, while the acting state president Dr Ajay Kumar adopted two—Mahmada in Samastipur and Maner in Patna district. Similarly, Dr Sunil Kumar, secretary, state branch adopted Pokhrawan in Lakhisarai and Jagmal Bigha near Fatuha in Patna. As there are about 12,000 doctors registered under 104 units functional across the state, the IMA state branch hoped adoption of over 20,000 villages including slums in their periphery for ensuring 100% immunisation at the earliest. Dr Sahjanand, who visited his adopted villages and talked to the people in the last two days said, “We held ‘chaupal’ type meetings and created awareness about vaccines in case of the third wave of the pandemic hitting the state sooner or later". As many villagers wanted to get the vaccines in the village itself, the IMA in association with the district administration concerned would hold special immunisation camps at the panchayat bhavans or any other government premise very soon, he said.. Dr Sahjanand also gave some oxymeters in these villages and taught some as how to measure oxygen saturation level. “If the oxygen level falls below 90, take it seriously, bring the person to the nearest health facility or even seek help from me anytime,” he said to the villagers. While many people of Mener village asked Dr Ajay Kumar during his visit on Sunday to hold immunisation camp there, another group of about 50 persons sought a separate camp with Sputnik vaccines and ready to pay the price. “I apoke to the Medanta hospital and they have agreed to hold camp only if the number of seekers of Sputnik shots reached around hundred,” he said. Dr Ajay said the state had witnessed ragedy and miseries during the second wave and now we do not want its repetition.  IMA secretary Dr Sunil said reports reaching from Motihari, Purnia Muzaffarpur and Gaya said many doctors have started identifying villages for adoption. Some enthusiastic doctors also planned to hold health awareness sessions with people in the villages being adopted by them, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ima-members-adopt-villages-for-awareness-about-immunisation/articleshow/84386608.cms||VK Tripathi

Senior officials who conducted a six-day crackdown on the high-speed corridor last week said drivers needed to be extra vigilant and pay more attention on this stretch, which begins at the spot where the erstwhile Amrutanjan bridge once stood. “We have studied the pattern of accidents on this stretch over a one-year period and have concluded that this was a dangerous stretch. In the past six months, six accidents have occurred on this stretch and four people lost their lives,” deputy transport commissioner (enforcement) Abhay Deshpande told TOI. On July 1, a boy and his parents were in a car, which collided with a loaded container truck. According to the police, the container had collided with the car on a slope, forcing the smaller vehicle to crash into a truck, killing the occupants.

---||India||On eve of 2011 blasts anniversary, mastermind Yasin Bhatkal charged||MUMBAI: On the eve of the 10-year anniversary of Mumbai triple blasts that claimed 27 lives, a special MCOCA court on Monday framed charges against the alleged mastermind Yasin Bhatkal who is currently lodged in Tihar jail. He was produced for the hearing via video-conferencing. Due to their alleged involvement in other cases, some among the 11 accused have been lodged in separate jails across the country. The trial in a case commences only after charges are framed against the accused. During Monday’s hearing, Bhatkal insisted on being produced for the framing of charges in person. The court noted he had not mentioned the grounds for such a plea. Bhatkal, though, iterated his physical attendance is a must and another accused also lodged in Tihar jail was produced before the court during the framing of his charges. It was then brought to the court’s notice that an order under Section 268 of CrPC had been passed because of which Bhatkal could not be transferred from his jail for security reasons. The court, in its order, also noted that opportunities had been given to him for a fair trial. “Otherwise, on account of his earlier successive refusals to hear charge, I would have proceeded further,” the court noted. Eventually, Bhatkal relented. The court read out the charges and subsequently framed them against him. Bhatkal pleaded not guilty. Charges were also framed against another accused, Ajaz Saeed Shaikh. The charges attract a maximum sentence of death. Both Bhatkal and Ajaz were earlier sentenced to death in another case. So far, the court has framed charges against 10 of the 11 accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/on-eve-of-2011-blasts-anniversary-mastermind-yasin-bhatkal-charged/articleshow/84395694.cms||Rebecca Samervel

He told reporters in Trichy that a report would be submitted to chief minister M K Stalin in this regard. “We conducted a meeting with our officials after being informed about schools in Puducherry reopening from July 16 for classes IX to XII. We can reopen the schools if the Covid-19 is under control, and parents should feel comfortable in sending their children. It will take some time,” the minister said. On the demand for enrolment in government schools, Poyyamozhi said that until last week, over 3.40 lakh students from government-aided and private schools have enrolled in government schools across the state. “We have to retain the students who have joined. This year, enrolment in government schools is high. So, infrastructure and staff strength will be improved. The existing faculties, particularly, in government schools offering English medium curriculum will be trained,” the minister said. Government school teachers said that the lockdown and lull in the economy for the second consecutive year have forced parents to opt for government schools. Several government schools have witnessed around 5-10% increase in enrolment compared to last year. “Priority for Tamil medium students in employment opportunities has made even government servants enrol their children in state-run schools,” A Manikandan, teacher, Gandarvakkottai government boys higher secondary school in Pudukkottai said. The minister said the government is collecting proper data to analyse the dropout scenario in classes IX and above. The dropout rate will be reduced from 17% to 5%, he assured. “The backlogs in the TNTET exam conducted in 2013 and 2017 for appointing new teachers have been brought to our notice, we will convey the situation to the chief minister for a solution,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tn-studying-pondy-move-to-reopen-schools-minister/articleshow/84390718.cms||---

Worshipped by the locals, the structures are treasure troves showcasing aspects of the Tamil culture and heritage dating back to the Nayak period. It is said that Usilampatti, got its name due to the Usilai forests that were common in the area. At the site, four pillars mark the two hero stones. Members of a Yaadhum Oore Yaavarum Kelir, an organisation of history enthusiasts, accompanied by rock art expert and historian K T Gandhirajan had ventured into this forest of Usilai trees, which locals consider sacred. A member of the organisation V Parthiban says the forest has remained unchanged here. “Locals do not collect firewood, or even break a twig from these trees or pick flowers or leaves, it is considered a crime to do so and hence these trees flourish here,” he said. Memorial stones are common in the state, most have two or three panels with information in writing or drawings about the person for whom the stone was erected, but this one is unique, says Gandhirajan. “The stones had nine layers of panels on them on all four sides, and they depicted stories in the small space with accuracy. Hero stones with many layers or panels are usually found in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, and it is possible that these stones were erected by people who migrated to this region from those states.” From the drawings and stone structure, the expert said the stones belong to the Nayak period, about 400 years old. The bigger of the two stones is 10ft in height and one foot in width. There are nine panels on the unbroken stones, and the second one also would have had the same number of panels. On the last panel, there are drawings of a Shiva linga and Nandhi, which may refer to heaven and immortality. One of the stories depicted is of goddess Petchiamman, the deity worshipped by the Pappampatti Nattar community, in Karumathur in the region. She is seen holding an infant. There is another of a man with a bow and arrow, and one of a man taming a bull and then getting married. A man on horseback is another diagram on these stones. A similar stone of a man on horseback is seen in Kongarpuliankulam in the neighbourhood and worshipped by the locals. These stones are referred to as Veerakambam and many such stones are found in the Cumbum region in Theni district, said Gandhirajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/forest-of-usilai-trees-in-madurai-home-to-nayak-period-hero-stones/articleshow/84388327.cms||---

The district administration had also identified buildings of 31 health centres for rainwater harvesting, but works on only five could be completed. The remaining works were pending for the allotment. Rainwater harvesting is useful for conservation of water for agriculture and even drinking purposes. Reviewing the status of soak pits construction near public handpumps, the DM gave three months’ time to complete the work. Of the total targeted number of 28,135 soak pits, about a thousand are complete. He also asked the officials to complete the renovation of wells in three months. Regarding the plantation drive, the DM directed the officials to meet the target of planting over four lakh saplings by August 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dm-expedite-rainwater-harvesting-on-govt-buildings/articleshow/84386675.cms||---

Additional chief secretary (panchayati raj) Manoj Kumar Singh told TOI 3,092 applications were received under revised protocols for determining death on duty from Covid-19 and 2,020 cases were recommended as eligible for compensation. “There are an additional 10-20 cases which will be forwarded to the state advisory board on Covid. Once they confirm eligibility, their families too will receive compensation,” he said. Under the earlier definition of death on duty, the government identified 74 government employees who died of Covid and non-Covid reasons. The rules stated ex-gratia would be given only if the employee died on duty or during travel to and from place of duty, which factored in a day or maximum two, depending on how far the employee travelled. However, with various associations claiming more employees succumbed to Covid-19 while on duty, chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed the chief secretary and panchayati raj officials to request election commission to amend rules to reflect the impact of the pandemic. On May 31, the cabinet approved the changed rules under which ex-gratia would be granted if Covid death took place within 30 days of the date of election duty. Those who tested negative, but died of post-Covid complications within a timeframe would also be considered for compensation. The government has considered a positive RTPCR or antigen test, blood report or CT scan of chest as evidence of Covid infection. In the cases forwarded for review to the advisory board, Singh said, RTPCR or antigen reports were missing, but doctor’s prescription, blood tests showing high CRP value and proof of treatment as Covid presumptive case were attached. An official said, 11 lakh government employees were on panchayat election duty this year, of which 6.5 lakh were teachers. Among the 2,020 who died of Covid, around 50% are teachers. The panchayati raj department will be uploading the list of all 2,020 on their portal. Of the roughly Rs 600 crore to be allocated for compensation, the panchayati raj department has released Rs 300crore to the election commission. The remaining amount will be released once the state election commission submits the utilisation certificate for the first instalment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/poll-duty-covid-deaths-ex-gratia-for-20k-staff/articleshow/84392844.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Lucknow||RTPCR test report may be must for Uttar Pradesh ‘kanwar yatra’||LUCKNOW: Shiva devotees may require a negative RTPCR report to participate in ‘kanwar yatra’ scheduled from July 25. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has directed officials to chalk out a plan under which devotees would have to produce a negative Covid report to cross over to UP, reports Neha Lalchandani. “This was discussed at the Team-9 meeting on Tuesday and the home department will finalise modalities of the plan, including testing location and validity period of RTPCR reports. The rule could apply compulsorily to those coming from other states, but may also be applicable to devotees within UP,” said a senior official. The CM had requested his counterpart in Uttarakhand to allow kanwars from UP to visit Haridwar to fetch Ganga Jal, but on Tuesday, Uttarakhand announced it would not lift its ban on the yatra. “Last year, both UP and Uttarakhand had cancelled the ‘kanwar yatra’ due to the pandemic, but since the infection rate is low this year, UP gave its nod. Uttarakhand, which had to call off the Char Dham yatra on court orders, had also suspended the kanwar yatra and decided to stick to its plan. UP will make arrangements to ensure yatris are able to perform puja and collect Ganga Jal from within the state itself,” said the official. A government spokesperson said, the CM wants to restrict the number of kanwar yatris in light of the pandemic and asked officials to appeal to committees and religious leaders to restrict their numbers and also follow Covid-19 protocols. The state government will coordinate with governments of Delhi, Haryana and Bihar to ensure smooth arrangements for the yatra in adherence to Covid protocols. “In a recent review meet, the CM directed officials to ensure arrangements for Covid helpdesks, Covid care centres, ambulance services and reservation of beds for yatris in hospitals. Infrared thermometers, pulse oxymeters and santitisers should be arranged in kanwar camps and shelters,” the spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rtpcr-test-report-may-be-must-for-up-kanwar-yatra/articleshow/84392903.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Encroachments on east side of Muthannankulam tank removed||COIMBATORE: With demolition of seven temples encroaching along the eastern bund of Muthannankulam tank at Kumarasamy Nagar here on Tuesday, the city corporation completed the drive to remove the encroachments along the bund. The corporation has been carrying out the drive to pave the path for the implementation of the lake rejuvenation and restoration project at the lake. So far, the corporation has demolished over 2,400 houses that were constructed encroaching the bund, according to a corporation official. The corporation is executing the project near Selvampathy and Kumarasamy lakes at a cost of Rs 31.25 crore. The official said, “The total area of the lake is 90 acres and of which, 15 acres had been encroached. We have removed all the encroachments and recovered the land. On Tuesday, we have demolished seven temples that were located at the bund. While six idols were given to the public after they assured to take care of them, we have kept another idol at the corporation office.” To commence the project at the lake, the corporation had started demolishing vacant houses in June after allocating alternative accommodation to the encroachers at the housing units of the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board in Malumichampatti, Kovai Pudur and Keeranatham. When they had demolished over 1,500 such illegal structures, the residents had approached the Supreme Court seeking a direction to stop the eviction drive. However, the judgement has come in favour of the corporation. Shortly after, the civic body had removed other illegal structures. Meanwhile, members of Hindu Munnani staged a protest at the site earlier that day demanding the corporation to provide alternative place to worship the idols. Police had detained about 240 members to continue the work. C Dhanapal, public relation officer of the outfit, said while the outfit had been demanding the corporation to provide an alternative site to worship the idols and the corporation, who has been in talks with us, started demolishing the temples at 6am. Vishwa Hindu Parishad, in a statement, said it has decided to stage a protest at Gandhi Park in the city on Wednesday condemning the corporation for demolishing the temples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/encroachments-on-east-side-of-muthannankulam-tank-removed/articleshow/84390741.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Littering of styrofoam plates irks lake regulars||KOLKATA: Morning walkers at Rabindra Sarobar have expressed shock at the continued littering of plates made of expanded polystyrene (commonly referred to as thermocol) littered around the entrance to the lake for over a fortnight. “In the past month, the parking lot opposite Calcutta Rowing Club (CRC) and the pavement at the entrance next to it has been littered with plates every afternoon. An individual distributes food to the poor. While the objective is noble, the use of styrofoam plates that are then littered everywhere has become a menace,” said lake activist Sumita Banerjee. According to Rabindra Sarobar police and Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) officials, a philanthropist has been distributing food to the poor. “Scores of vagrants gather near the lake's entrance and at the parking lot opposite CRC in the afternoon before the vans arrive to distribute food. When they leave after the meals, the place is littered with plates. Both distribution of food and disposal of the plates should be regulated to prevent dirtying the area,” said CRC secretary Chandan Roychowdhury. Anti-pollution activist SM Ghosh called for use of saal plates and managing the disposal to prevent litter. "Rabindra Sarobar is an eco-sensitive zone. Use of expanded polystyrene, a petroleum-based non-biodegradable material, should be banned. Yet, thousands of used plates made of this toxic substance are getting piled up near the lake," he fumed. Cups and plates made of expanded polystyrene take 500 years or more to disintegrate. “Use of these non-biodegradable items need to be totally banned. These are dangerous items, playing havoc with the ecosystem,” said Abhijit Roy, a regular at Rabindra Sarobar. The feisty Banerjee, who is also known as Lake Mamata for her crusade to protect the lake, has asked police and the lake’s custodian KMDA to immediately act against the littering. “We are not against feeding the poor. But that cannot happen at the expense of vitiating the atmosphere around the lake. I am sure philanthropy can be carried out in a systematic manner without adversely affecting the environment,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/littering-of-styrofoam-plates-irks-lake-regulars/articleshow/84388359.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Trichy||Trichy Corporation revives Srirangam bus stand plan, to acquire private land||TRICHY: Trichy Corporation has revived the satellite bus terminus proposal for Srirangam, which houses the Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy and Arulmigu Jambukeswarar temples. Two private sites have been selected for the proposal initiated in 2013, by keeping the accessibility to the temples as a key factor, as they attract a large number of devotees. Initially, two sites were considered for the proposal - corporation’s land on flood bank road and an underutilised public space near the Srirangam zonal corporation office, but were ruled out. While the site near Yatri Nivas was dropped due to the flood vulnerability in the adjacent Kollidam river, the one near the corporation office was found unviable for free movement of buses. Corporation sources said that private land acquisition is the solution for establishing the satellite bus stand to prevent traffic bottlenecks. “Private land acquisition will make the project expensive, but there is no other option,” a senior corporation official said. With at least 15,000 people visiting Srirangam and Thiruvanaikoil temples on normal days and the number surging to lakhs during festivals, the bus stand proposal was cited as imminent despite the cost involved. “Two private sites are okayed by considering the convenience of public and devotees. Bus stand for Srirangam is a decided project, a formal announcement will be made by the CM in the assembly,” Srirangam MLA M Palaniyandi said. Meanwhile, locals said that a bus stand for Srirangam is mandatory to decongest the saturated Chathiram city bus terminus as there was a perception that it may be scrapped by citing the integrated bus terminus planned in Panjappur. “Public consultation should be initiated to hear different ideas. The decade-old project must be established at any cost,” Suresh Venkatachalam, a resident of Srirangam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/corpn-revives-srirangam-bus-stand-plan-to-acquire-pvt-land/articleshow/84390743.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Vishwa Hindu Parishad kicks up storm over one-child incentive plan||LUCKNOW: A day after Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) raised the ante over one-child provision in the state population bill drafted by UP state law commission, sources in the right-wing outfit said, apprehensions were drawn from the potential negative impact on the Hindu community. VHP working president Alok Kumar shot off a missive to state law commission, which drafted the population draft bill, saying Uttar Pradesh should avoid propping up incentives for parents with a single child as this can have a deterring effect on the state’s demography. He categorically cited Assam and Kerala, where the Muslim population growth rate has surpassed that of Hindus. While Hindu population growth in the two states has dipped below 2.1, Muslim growth rate in Assam and Kerala is around 3.16 and 2.33 respectively, he said. The UP Population (Control, Stabilisation and Welfare Bill), 2021, entails that couples with one child will get special incentives like two additional increments, free healthcare facilities and insurance coverage for the single child till they reach 20 years of age. The single child will get preference in admission in educational institutions. The commission has invited objections from people vis-a-vis bill by July 19. Kumar said the commission should reconsider the provision of bringing the reproductive rate to 1.7. He said, the population stabilizes when the reproductive growth rate is at least 2.1. “This compensates in the event of a death of one child,” Kumar said in the letter. He said, adopting the two-child norm will “lead to contradictions” between various social groups and fuel economic disparity. He cited China which had to relax rules after advocating the single-child policy of 1980. While Kumar was not available for comment, VHP national spokesperson, Vinod Bansal told TOI that historically, it is the Hindu community which adheres to various laws, especially population laws. This will trigger a negative growth rate among Hindus, which is not desirable at this point of time, he said. VHP, otherwise, welcomes the objective of the policy which envisages stabilization of the population. The bill assumed political overtones with the Opposition, mainly Samajwadi Party, lashing out at the ruling BJP of stoking a “propaganda” to divert people’s attention from failures on various fronts in the run-up to assembly elections next year. Terming the bill as a part of BJP’s political design, SP MP from Sambhal, Shaqfiqur Rahman Barq went on to say the state government should ban marriages if it wants to stabilize rising population. In Farrukhabad, Congress leader Salman Khurshid said, “before making the law, the government should specify how many legitimate and illegitimate children its ministers have.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vhp-kicks-up-storm-over-one-child-incentive-plan/articleshow/84392946.cms||Pankaj Shah

The procession, organized by Mullaicharal farmers association and Mullaiperiyar ayacut and drinking water protection association, started at Cumbum bus terminal and ended at Sundaravadivelan temple. The protesters who carried pots of milk performed abhishekam on the deity seeking divine intervention in the matter. The protesters said they have been opposing the project since its proposal stage as it would affect the drinking water prospects of Theni district in summer and cause water shortage for farmers. Madurai corporation proposed the project a couple of years ago to augment drinking water project as the city’s water availability of 150MLD to 170 MLD is not sufficient for a population of 17 lakh. The project involves construction of a check dam at Lower Camp in Theni and bringing water to the city through pipeline. It was proposed under Amrut scheme through Asian Development Bank funding. M Sathish Babu, coordinator of the protest, said they are not against increasing water supply to Madurai city, but they are against taking the water through a giant pipeline. The water should have been taken to Vaigai river through the natural river course as it would have helped in recharging underground water table. Already, the ground water level has fallen deep, harming farming activities, he said. “When rain plays truant for two successive years, Theni district faces shortage of water for drinking purpose. Hardly 50 MLD would be released for drinking in summer if the dam level comes down,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mullaperiyar-water-for-madurai-will-cause-scarcity-in-theni/articleshow/84388375.cms||---

The alleged incident took place late on Monday night when the DB squad was returning to the police station after dropping an externed criminal out of the city limits. Locals have claimed that the alleged heated argument broke out after the youth overtook the police jeep. Locals have also alleged that the policemen were in an inebriated state when the incident took place. The incident took place on a day when state home minister Dilip Walse Patil, during a press conference, state that he has asked policemen to behave and interact with every commoner with due respect. “We have asked deputy commissioner of police zone-II to conduct an inquiry and submit a report by tomorrow. Irrespective of who is found to be at fault, be it police or the youth will definitely face stringent legal action,” Gupta said. Video of the incident where policemen can be seen assaulting the youth, twisting his arm and forcefully trying to push him in the police jeep has not gone down well with the senior police officers, including Jinsi police station inspector Vyankat Kendre. The video also shows passersby gathering and questioning the police for their alleged highhandedness of rounding up a youth without any offence or a warrant. Unable to justify their action, the police team left the spot. Anticipating the youth and his family may lodge a complaint, DB squad members made an attempt to lodge a complaint stating that the youth tried to rob them of their mobile phone and cash. But Kendre refused to entertain their complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/probe-ordered-after-video-of-cops-assaulting-youth-goes-viral/articleshow/84390787.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Bookings on Rath Yatra renew business hope in Kumartuli||KOLKATA: New orders, payment of token advance amount and queries from puja committees across Kolkata on the day of Rath on Monday have brought some cheer in Kumartuli and rekindled hope of decent business this Durga Puja. The festival was a subdued affair last year due to the pandemic and the Covid-19 guidelines. The way second wave hit in April and cases surged, there was a pall of gloom at the potters’ enclave, who thought the festival will be a washout this year as well. But with cases declining over the past two weeks, Durga Puja organisers have started preparing for low-scale pujas and many have already paid token amounts to idol-makers in Kumartuli. Many believe that booking idols and initiating other preparations for Durga Puja on the day of Rath is auspicious. This year, too, many organisers did visit Kumartuli on Monday though the number was very small compared to pre-pandemic days. “In April-May-June, when the second wave was creating havoc, we felt the festival will be a washout this year. Artists had given up all hope. But with cases declining, we have started receiving queries from puja organisers and many have handed over token money and placed their orders. Though it is not going to be anything like the pre-pandemic times, still it is better than what we were expecting two months ago,” said Mintu Paul, a senior artist in Kumartuli. Several big-ticket pujas like College Square, SreebhumiSporting Club and Chetla Agrani have already placed orders for idols. Forum for Durgotsab has appealed to the organisers to keep the festival low-key and make sure that big crowds are not attracted. The trend at Kumartuli this year is of small idols. Fund crunch and government guidelines are the reasons why organisers have decided to reduce the size of idols. “Almost all organisers who have placed orders till now have reduced the size of the idol for various reasons,” said Mintu Paul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bookings-on-rath-renew-biz-hope-in-kumartuli/articleshow/84388374.cms||Zeeshan Javed

An act more out of desperation to survive than anything else, the organisers say they have opened for business but so far have received very feeble response. Usually considered as one of the busiest periods of the year, the scenes at Chitpore Road echo the lull prevalent across the performing arts industry across Bengal — with most offices shut, unkempt posters and banners with only a few putting up fresh banners and keeping their doors half ajar, waiting for customers. The weeks leading to Rath Yatra were considered the busiest time for the troupes, finalising bookings and managing rehearsals, fixing props, music and light and chart the schedule for upcoming months. A number of troupes also used to perform shows during Rathyatra. “I have lost business worth Rs 20 lakhs in last one year. We can’t sit back and do nothing as the livelihood of 40 odd artistes and technicians depend on us. We are open for business and just hoping the Covid situation gets better in the coming months,” said Bapi Ghosh, owner of New Jatralok Opera. “With the looming third wave and restrictions in place, the feasibility of the upcoming season is in question. We are still sending our leaflets and list of shows to several organisers but there have been zero bookings as of now. We have even lowered our rates but even that hasn’t helped,” said Paresh Raut, the manager of Agnibina Opera . Nepal Dutta, the manager-cum-director of Sonar Bangla Jatra Sanstha, said such has been the situation that several technicians and junior artistes are selling fish and vegetables by the roadside. Ashok Das, the producer and owner of Rajlakshni Opera, added that rising oil prices have made things further difficult for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/organizers-start-afresh-announce-jatra-schedule/articleshow/84388369.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Nagpur||Nagpur company’s first-in-India implants can be ‘face-saver’ for mucormycosis patients||NAGPUR: For patients who are losing their facial parts while undergoing treatment for mucormycosis, a company from the city has invented a solution that can bring their life to near-normal. LUCID Implants, formed by two VNIT alumni engineers and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, has become the first Indian company to produce polyether ether ketone (PEEK)-based customized implants. These implants can maintain a patient’s unique facial anatomy. The experts use customized face reconstruction mechanisms with advanced 3D printing technologies and virtual surgical planning. “We have been researching on this since our college days. At that time, our focus was on oral cancer patients, trauma patients and those who born with congenital deformities. As mucormycosis started wreaking havoc following second wave of Covid-19, we started thinking about recreating facial parts,” said Prashanth Ray, one of the founders who is former visiting researcher at Johns Hopkins University, USA. Facial anatomy of every person is different. Many of them lose their eyes during mucormycosis treatment. Sometimes, surgeons reconstruct facial bones by taking out a bone from limbs, but achieving perfection is very difficult in this surgery. “Facial anatomy involves complex shapes and hence, cannot be practically achieved by autogenous grafts. Patients suffering from Covid are already suffering from systemic conditions, especially in lungs. Hence, reducing surgical and anaesthesia time is need of the hour. Patient-specific implants and virtual surgical planning helps us reduce a lot of OT time,” said Dr Nitin Bhola, one of the directors of LUCID and a maxillofacial surgeon. Dr Pranav Sapkal, who has done post doctoral research in tissue engineering, said the implants will restore the dignity and confidence of the patients. “What we aim through this is to bring life of these patients back to normal. We have successful documentation of 120-plus cases. One major procedure is set to be done in Chennai soon. Actor and philanthropist Sonu Sood, who also has a strong Nagpur connect, has sponsored this surgery,” said Dr Pranav, adding that the surgery is going to be a milestone and a blend of technology and medicine streams. Doctors treating patients of mucormycosis or black fungus are considering this innovation as a new ray of hope. “Many young and working people have lost their facial parts, but we have successfully saved their lives. Reconstruction of face is always a challenging field. Use of technology can do wonders. We are looking forward to use these implants in our hospital,” said a senior doctor from a leading private hospital in city where mucor patients are being treated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-companys-first-in-india-implants-can-be-face-saver-for-mucormycosis-patients/articleshow/84390795.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Following complaints that the sewer on ward 91 in the south zone was clogged, corporation officials had asked the sanitary workers to unclog the same manually without providing them any safety gears, instead of using suction-cum-jetting machines, said R Tamil Nadu Selvam, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Ambedkar Sanitary Workers’ Association. “It is not a lone case. Similar incidents have been taking place across the city limits. When sanitary supervisors ask the workers to clean the sewers and threaten not to give other works if they fail to do it, how will the latter refuse to do it? After all, their livelihood is dependent on it,” he said. He said the corporation had not distributed proper safety gears to all, despite several requests to distribute the same to both the permanent and temporary sanitary workers. Most of the times, he said, the workers fail to wash their hands properly after completing their works because of lack of facilities. “So, they develop several health complications.” C Venmani, an advocate-cum-activist, said it was the responsibility of the state government to take steps to abolish manual scavenging and strict action against those who employ them. “Awareness should be created among the sanitary workers regarding the ill-effects of manually cleaning the sewer without any safety gears. Both the government and the workers should work together to abolish the system.” When contacted, city corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara said the issue was already brought to their knowledge and the city health officer was inquiring into the issue. “We have been distributing rubber gloves to the workers once in a few months. We would conduct an inquiry to know whether it’s a case of not distributing the safety gears in certain parts or workers not using them. Based on the report, action will be taken,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/contract-sanitary-workers-clean-sewer-with-bare-hands/articleshow/84390788.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The state government had made this vaccine a part of the universal immunization programme. Senior officials of the Nashik Zilla Parishad said that while the vaccine was available in private hospitals earlier, it has been made a part of the universal immunization programme to help infants from the economically-backward background. District immunisation officer Dinesh Patil said that the immunization programme was launched on Tuesday. There are 77,500 beneficiaries in the rural parts of the district. Officials said that children aged under one are given three doses of the vaccine — at six weeks, 14 weeks and nine months. “Pamphlets have been printed to raise awareness among the people. The vaccine would be given during the routine immunization programme,” he said. The vaccine is expensive and its availability through the universal immunisation programme will make it accessible to larger population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pneumococcal-vax-now-given-under-immunisation-plan/articleshow/84390831.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Patna||2-child norm likely for rural poll nominees in state: Bihar minister||PATNA: A day after CM Nitish Kumar said mere framing law will not serve the purpose so far as population control is concerned, state panchayati raj minister Samrat Choudhary on Tuesday said the state has already a provision since 2006-07 that any individual having more than two children cannot contest urban local body elections in Bihar. Nitish on Monday had stressed the need for education and awareness among women to control birth rate. “Proper education of women and mass awareness will only help control the population growth,” he had told the media on the sidelines of his janata darbar programme. Samrat, who is a BJP MLC, said the panchayati raj department is now mulling over a provision to debar individuals having more than two children from contesting the panchayat elections in future. “Such measures are more relevant these days to control the population,” he said. Choudhary, however, clarified that the new provision will not come into effect for the upcoming panchayat elections in the state. “It will take at least one year to bring the new provision into effect,” he told the media on the sidelines of a political debate over population control measures. The minister said the panchayati raj department will bring about amendment to the Panchayati Raj Act, 2005 to facilitate the new provision in the 3-tier panchayati raj system. In 2016, around 10 lakh candidates were in the fray for more than 2.58 lakh posts in panchayats. JD (U) parliamentary board chairman and former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha also corroborated the CM’s views. “One cannot think of population control without educating women,” he told reporters at Motihari on Monday. Former deputy CM and BJP Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi said education and incentives to girls are the only ways to control birth rate. He said in Bihar, the reproduction rate is 2.7%, which is to be reduced to 2.1% by 2025 and 2.0% by 2031. “The reproduction rate has no relation with any religion,” he said, adding that rise in population hampered economic development. A day earlier, state deputy CM Renu Devi said education for men is equally important to control the population. She said women were pressurized by men for more children due to lack of education and awareness. On the other hand, main opposition RJD warned the Centre against any strict measures to control the population. RJD state president Jagadanand Singh reminded the Centre of the repercussions against the population control measures taken by late Sanjay Gandhi of the Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/2-child-norm-likely-for-rural-poll-nominees-in-state-minister/articleshow/84386477.cms||Ramashankar
---||Trichy||Street vendors get alternative space in Gandhi market in Trichy||TRICHY: A section of street vendors selling fruits in and around Gandhi market in Trichy city were streamlined by providing an alternative space at a peace talk organised between city police, Trichy corporation and representatives of street vendors on Tuesday. The street vendors, who were earlier evicted from the operational area will be given identification cards by the civic body. Therefore they were asked not to park their pushcarts adjacent to the arterial roads. Recently, street vendors operating from pushcarts mostly stationed in vacant spaces adjacent to the roads including Thanjavur main road, Palakkarai road and Big Bazaar street arch were found hindering vehicular movement. To ensure hassle-free vehicular movement, the city police had asked them to vacate the road space. As the instructions resulted in a backlash with the vendors planning a protest at Ariyamangalam zonal corporation office, a peace talk was held at the Fort assistant commissioner of police office on Tuesday. About 54 vendors were given space in the Diamond jubilee bazaar space, situated opposite to the Gandhi market’s main entrance. “Vendors have agreed to pay the user fee. Trichy corporation has assured to provide ID cards as well,” K Suresh, district general secretary, AITUC said. The locals sought a similar solution for the traffic bottlenecks reported in other commercial streets due to vendors and rampant on-street parking by the customers visiting the commercial complexes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/street-vendors-get-alternative-space-in-gandhi-market/articleshow/84390866.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cops warn against fake bank SMSes||KOLKATA: Have you received an SMS recently stating that you have been credited with a lump sum amount? If that same SMS has asked you to click on a link to ascertain your personal details or has asked you to download an app, be vigilant and do not click on the links. The fraudsters at the other end are waiting for you to do just that. The anti-bank fraud section of the detective department has warned citizens of a new form of online bank fraud that has already duped several victims in the city in the past week. Senior citizens have been the prime targets. Police have decided to use various social media platforms to spread awareness on this new form of cyber crime. On Tuesday, cops shared a detailed video on Facebook to explain the modus operandi of the gang. “Stay vigilant against a new form of payment fraud. People get a fake SMS that money has been deposited in their bank account and they get lured into clicking a link and sharing personal details. In the process, they lose their hard-earned savings. Don’t fall for such messages and always keep a check. Immediately report them on 8585063104,” the cops wrote. Police said that while this is an old trick, it has come back in a more vicious form during the Covid situation, especially when senior citizens are avoiding visit to the bank. Immediately after cops warned netizens, they received feedback from citizens who reported receiving such messages. One Md Suman Biswas and Wasim Khan wrote that they had received such messages and stating their parents had even sought advice on them on whether to click on the links. “The fraudsters are constantly innovating ways to trick the customers and rob them of their money. And, one such way is by sending fake text messages or SMSes. Such activity is called ‘smishing’ and occurs when deceptive text messages are used to lure consumers into providing their personal or financial information. Mostly, these smishing messages come in a disguised form where fraudsters impersonate a government agency, bank or other company to lend legitimacy to their claims. They often ask customers to provide usernames and passwords, credit and debit card numbers, PINs or other sensitive information,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-warn-against-fake-bank-smses/articleshow/84388381.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

However, they are hoping that the planetary alignment could be viewed again in the next few days. “While observing from Earth, we would be able to see Venus approaching Mars closely even though both are crores of kilometres apart. We had planned to observe the event and promote awareness among school children to encourage them to study about the planets, but the clouds played spoilsport,” said R Ahilan, project director of the planetarium. While Venus would have been bright, Mars would have appeared faintly but could be spotted close to each other. Mars was situated at 37.19 crore kilometre and Venus was situated 21.36 crore kilometres from the Earth during the conjunction. The 3-degree angular separation had made the conjunction that last happened in 2019 invisible. Again, such conjunction is expected to be seen on February 22, 2024. “We will keep observing the sky in the next few days if the sky is clear and we will make arrangements for people to witness the event virtually,” Ahilan added. The planetarium is closed due to Covid-19 restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/clouds-block-view-of-mars-venus-conjunction/articleshow/84390835.cms||---

The camp, first of its kind in the state, plans to vaccinate 300 workers in the sectors who are directly interacting with tourists. After the intense lockdown restrictions were lifted, the tourism department in Trichy said that pilgrimage and tourist destinations such as Samayapuram, Srirangam, Mukkombu and Puliyanzholai near Thuraiyur have started attracting domestic tourists. The fall in the number of Covid-19 cases in the coming days is expected to revive the inflow of inter-state and international tourists. Travel agents, tourist guides, hotel and bar employees, autorickshaw and cab operators were invited to the camp, which will be held at Hotel Tamil Nadu at Cantonment. “We are expecting to vaccinate 300 people who will be exposed to the visitors. If the demand is more, we will organise similar camps in the coming days,” T Jegatheswari, district tourist officer, said. Once vaccinated, the workers will gain the trust of travellers. Since people are gradually moving out to the tourist spots to overcome the lockdown blues, hotels were told to ensure that the employees and their family members are vaccinated, the tourism officer said. “District administration has promised to provide adequate vaccine doses. As there is a slight improvement in public movement, we thought vaccination coverage will induce confidence among the tourists,” the tourist officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/vax-camp-in-trichy-for-tourism-sector-workers-today/articleshow/84390885.cms||---

These exams were conducted online in May. The delay in the announcement of results is likely to affect students pursuing higher education in the country and abroad. “I am worried about losing my conditional offer letter from an international university,” said a TYBSc student, adding that they would cancel the admission if the final marksheets are not submitted within the varsity’s deadline. Vinod Patil, director, board of examinations and evaluation, said they had been facing shortage of staff due to the pandemic and lockdown-like curbs. “Co-ordinating with colleges, which are also running on limited staff, is also adding to the delay. We are working on the results and hope to announce most of them in the 8-10 days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-university-students-worried-over-final-year-results-delay/articleshow/84394608.cms||---

All these days, the names of vaccination centres and the number of dozes allotted to those centres were announced the previous day. This resulted in people thronging the vaccination centres from midnight and wait all through the night. TOI had published a series of photographs on Tuesday showing scores of people, including aged, waiting in the chilly weather the whole night to get vaccinated the next morning. Often there were also complaints that people from neighbouring localities too came to these centres and got the jabs, depriving people from that locality. A statement from the district administration said that the name of the panchayat where vaccination would be done that day would be announced only at 8am. Tokens for vaccination would be issued from 10am in those centres and vaccines would be administered from 11am to those who got the tokens.

The accused duo allegedly entered the house posing as insurance agents. According to police, the house belongs to Tarun Verma, who owns a restaurant in Ghaziabad. The robbers allegedly held Tarun’s mother at knifepoint and when he tried to help her, one of the men attacked him with a knife, police said. The robbers fled the spot when Tarun’s mother raised the alarm. According to the complainant, he was in his room around 2.30pm when two people came and knocked on their gate. Uma (62), Tarun’s mother, opened the door and the two accused men introduced themselves as insurance agents. “They offered her an insurance scheme but my mother said she did not want it. Then they asked my mother for a glass of water and when she went to the kitchen, the men walked in to the house. Once my mother asked them why they were inside the house, one of them pointed a knife at her and the other man tried to cover her mouth. But somehow, she managed to raise the alarm,” Tarun said. He added that he was sleeping at that time and once he heard his mother’s cry for help, he came outside. “I saw the youths inside the house and asked them to leave my mother. But they threatened me. One of them came close to me and pointed a pistol at me as well. When I figured that they would not let my mother go, I hurled a pot at them and the knife slipped from the accused’s hand. Immediately, I slapped the man and he took me at gunpoint. The other accused came and held me back,” Tarun said. In the meantime, Uma ran outside the house and called for help. Hearing her cries, the accused fled. Sanjeev Sharma, SHO, Kavi Nagar, said that an FIR has been lodged under sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 352 (punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation) of the IPC. “A probe is on and we are trying to trace the duo,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/2-pose-as-insurance-agents-try-to-rob-eatery-owner-kin/articleshow/84392972.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

The government had on Monday announced prize money of Rs 6 crore for gold medallists, and Rs 4 crore and Rs 2 crore for those winning silver and bronze medals. It also announced that all participants would be given Rs 10 lakh each. However, a few sportspersons said the government should also invest more in providing facilities to players which would help the country win more medals. “It is a welcome step which would motivate players to improve their performance. However, I would request the government to support players from the very beginning and also announce such rewards when they win state and national events. Budding players desperately need financial support during their initial years of struggle,” said Annu Rani, javelin thrower from Meerut, who is set to perform in the Tokyo Olympics. She is currently training in Pune. Satish Kumar, a boxer from Bulandshahr, who is currently practising in Italy, hailed the government’s announcement and said the step would not only motivate Olympic participants but also inspire young players to do their best and achieve new heights. “More stadiums, sports hostels and facilities should come up in the state so that players from rural backgrounds may also get training,” Kumar said. Tokyo-bound race-walker from Meerut, Priyanka Goswami, who is practising in Bangalore, also welcomed the move and said it would promote sports activities. “It is a fantastic move by the government which will motivate players. But we should not forget that to win an Olympic medal, players need world-class infrastructure and facilities. Much needs to be done on that front. It is my dream to set up a shooting range in UP with the support of the government,” said Mairaj Ahmad Khan, international shooter from Bulandshahr. Sports director RP Singh said the reward announced by the UP government was the highest in the country. “It is no mean achievement for any player to qualify for the Olympics. This is the reason why the government has announced Rs 10 lakh for all participants. It will also motivate budding players.” General secretary, UP Olympic Association , Anandeshwar Pandey said, “Be it Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, governments are working to promote sports. I would request the state government to consider increasing the reward announced for all participants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/oly-bound-players-hail-govt-declaration-of-cash-reward/articleshow/84393006.cms||Fazal Khan

With 408 people getting discharged, the number of active cases fell further to 3,779. The total number of people recovered however rose to 2,19,730, keeping the recovery rate at 97.3%. The district recorded one death due to the virus taking the toll to 2,108. The victim was a 65-year-old man, who was diabetic. With the district’s vaccination drive restarting on Monday after nine days, people were standing from 3am in front of schools where vaccines were allotted. People braved rain and cool weather to get vaccinated. There were also protests and roadblocks by some people after they found discrepanices in distributing tokens. On Tuesday morning, nearly about 50 people, who were waiting for tokens, blocked the main road in front of the corporation school at Peelamedu as they believed tokens for only a fraction of the allotted 200 doses were distributed. “We have been waiting in the rain from 3am and suddenly organizers tell us that tokens were over. They definitely did not distribute 200,” said a protester. At Vadamadurai Government Primary School, the waiting public got into a scuffle with the police. “The government notice says 500 doses were allotted, but how can they finish distributing it in hardly 20 or 30 minutes?,” shouted one protester. “Token number 50 was hardly given 15 minutes back and they say tokens are over. They definitely did not distribute more than 250 tokens,” said another protester who had been waiting from 3am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coimbatore-records-282-fresh-cases-one-death/articleshow/84390910.cms||---

Police said that as per the complaint, Ashraf (35), who hails from Oorallur, was kidnapped from his residence by a five-member gang who arrived there in a car around 6.30am Koyilandy inspector of police Sandeepkumar MP said that Ashraf is suspected to have worked as a carrier and the gang involved in gold smuggling had abducted him saying that he had not handed over the smuggled gold to the person for whom it was brought. As per the statements given by his relatives, a person involved in the kidnapping team had approached Ashraf twice asking for gold. Ashraf had arrived in Kerala in the last week of May. Koyilandy police registered a case on the complaint filed by Ashraf’s brother. “The gang came to our house early in the morning and one of them pointed a gun at my head asked if I was Ashraf. When I told that Ashraf was sleeping in another room, they went there and carried him to the vehicle. When our mother tried to prevent them from taking him away, they pushed her out of the way and took him,” said Ashraf’s brother Siddique. Police are looking into reports that Ashraf had a case registered against him in connection with gold smuggling through Kochi airport four years ago. Police have formed a special team headed by Vadakara deputy superintendent of police to investigate the case. The kidnapping of the expat has taken place at a time when customs and police are inquiring into such cases connected with Karipur international airport. The spurt in gold smuggling in recent years had spawned an allied criminal activity of quotation gangs engaged in robbing of smuggling gold. There have been a series of such heists in the region and the latest robbery bid of smuggled gold at Ramanattukara had led to a road accident in which five persons of a gang from Cherpulassery were killed recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/expat-kidnapped-at-gunpoint/articleshow/84388404.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Manchu Vishnu offers to construct MAA building||HYDERABAD: With Tollywood gearing up for polls to the Movie Artistes Association (MAA), actor Manchu Vishnu, an aspirant for the post of president, has offered to construct a building for the association with his own money. “I will do it on my own and with contributions from my family. It will be upon ourselves to construct the building,” Vishnu said. Vishnu, it appears, has played his best card as all the groups which are vying for power in the association, like always, are only talking about an own building for MAA. Vishnu pointed out that even in the past, he had made an offer to contribute 25 per cent of the expenditure for the building but no one took the idea forward concretely. “Seniors of the film industry even asked me to contest for president some years ago but I refused considering my age,” Vishnu said, recalling the time when he was vice-president of MAA. Though elections are to be held in September for the 900-member artistes body, actors have already split into at least five panels to contest, including one led by Prakash Raj. However, with an acrimonious debate taking place among aspirants belonging to various groups, senior actors are said to have been upset with the kind of atmosphere that has been created. Actor Murali Mohan, who once served as a president, is taking the initiative for a unanimous election to take place so that actors would sink all their differences and put up a show as one united body. Meanwhile, actor CVL Narasimha Rao has raised a demand for bifurcating the MAA. “There should be a separate body for Telangana actors,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vishnu-offers-to-construct-maa-bldg/articleshow/84390938.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Mumbai||BMC will boost no. of booths for February civic polls||MUMBAI: As part of its preparations for the BMC elections scheduled for February next year, the BMC will add around 4,000 polling booths keeping the Covid-19 pandemic in mind. Currently there are around 7,900 booths, which BMC may need to increase to around 12,000. Each booth is known to have 1,400-1,500 voters now, but will only have around 800 voters for the February 2022 polls. In May this year, the State Election Commission (SEC) gave the BMC the go-ahead for the civic polls as scheduled in February 2022 and asked the BMC to begin preparations for the elections keeping in mind Covid-19 protocols. “We are charting out a detailed plan for conducting the BMC elections in view of the pandemic. We will increase the number of booths and create an awareness campaign for upgrading voters’ lists. Our focus right now is to ensure there is no inconvenience to voters,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. The SEC asked the BMC to begin work on delimitation of electoral wards or rectification of wards which were redrawn in 2017. Since no new census data after the 2011 census is currently available to carry out a full-fledged delimitation exercise, it is likely that only a rectification process will be carried out. The SEC has also asked the BMC to prepare new voter lists based on the voter lists for the 2019 state assembly elections. “We will try and fully vaccinate all staffers at polling booths and on poll duty. We have also been asked to ensure Covid-appropriate norms are followed while making arrangements,” said the official. Last time, prior to the 2017 BMC elections, on October 3, 2016, the lottery for reservations was held for the 227 wards and delimitation of wards was officially announced. While 50% seats are reserved for women candidates, from the 50% too there is reservation in for SC, ST and OBC categories among women candidates. The SEC has said that draft boundaries of electoral wards in Mumbai for the upcoming BMC polls will be published and suggestions and objections will be called before they are finalised. The SEC told the Congress in a written response that the final ward boundaries will be published after considering suggestions and objections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-will-boost-no-of-booths-for-feb-civic-polls/articleshow/84394661.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Lucknow||‘Board assessment criteria workable but caution must’||LUCKNOW: After the central government cancelled the Board examinations in view of the continuing Covid-19 pandemic across the country, the decision came as a relief to many but saddened those who had been studying hard for it. The decision triggered many doubts among students like the impact of the assessment criteria, how will they gain admission to universities, and how will it affect their career prospects. Former CBSE chief Ashok Ganguly said the assessment criteria – 30% marks of top three subjects in Class 10, 30% marks of Class 11, and 40% of Class 12 internal exams – is simple and workable but needs a cautious approach on its implementation to ensure that the assessment process has reliability, validity and credibility. “I doubt that the interim measure taken by the Board will do any justice to meritorious students. Though the examination bodies have tried their best to do away with arbitrariness, there are conflicts of interest which may creep in during implementation,” he said. Ganguly raised three important issues. “Firstly, the Board needs to be careful with secondary data like Class 11 results and other examinations like half-yearly and pre-Board. This data, which is not with the Board, has chances of being fudged. Secondly, the Boards should consider only institutionalised examinations like half-yearly instead of pre-boards and unit tests. Lastly, there is a lack of clarity on the best of three subjects in Class 10,” Ganguly added. He said the possibility of fudging of marks in respect to secondary data can be arrested with moderation. “CBSE must compare the marks with the mean of each subject in each school last year, followed by moderation. I think we need to ensure that no further exams are conducted now by any school. Only the examinations that have already been conducted should be considered,” he said. Batting for a good mix of summative assessments and continuous and comprehensive evaluation, Ganguly said time had come for transformation of the Board examinations. “Looking into the pandemic and unpredictability, we can no longer depend on one short-term exam. With continuous evaluation, assessment can be done in a scientific manner even in times of uncertainty,” he said. Seconding him, principal of Delhi Public School, Varanasi, Mukesh Shelat said assessment renaissance was the need of the hour. “Right from kindergarten, we need to prepare students for self-winning, focus on multiple intelligence, learning styles and project-based learning,” Shelat said, adding that the Gurukul system was perfect as it focused on blended learning. According to Shelat, there has to be a 360-degree assessment by peers, teachers, and parents. He suggested that the Board needs to get the marks of all tests, including half-yearly exams of Class 9 and 11, besides Class 10 and 12, uploaded on their portal. “It has to be a data-driven school landscape now. Transparency of data is easily possible. This can be used if there is some discrepancy in results,” said Shelat. Unhappy with the evaluation criteria of the Boards, founder of Lucknow’s City Montessori School, Jagdish Gandhi, pitched for Board exams. “Fearing Covid-19 wave, everything should not be stopped. Crowded places like malls and markets, which can be a Covid-spreader have been opened but schools, which offer controlled environment to students, are still shut. Students are losing out on studies,” he said. Stating that students have totally opposed the marking formula announced by the Boards, Gandhi said, “Students want Boards to evaluate them on 100%. Also, no divisions will be declared this year which will ruin the future of meritorious students seeking admission in good universities, including outside India.” “After the marking formula, students are asking for their exact scores,” said principal, Maharshi Patanjali Vidya Mandir, Sushmita Kanungo. Citing a survey done at her school, she said nearly 50% of Class 12 students said they were unhappy with the existing assessment model. “The average or above average students are on a winning side but meritorious ones are definitely dissatisfied and feel they are losing out. They felt they would have done better in Boards which was not the case with pre-boards,” she said. Ganguly said the confusion was primarily due to the 30% weightage to best three subjects in Class 10 board examination results. “Instead, they could have kept it straight, 30% marks in each subject and then adding it to respective subject in Class 12. For instance, if marks scored in English and social science are the highest, there is no point adding it to physics, chemistry and biology,” he said, adding that the directives from the Boards must have clarity and rationale and there should be no ambiguity. He felt that the Boards, instead of issuing lengthy directives, should have made it concise and brief. “The problem is that most schools are raising concerns, questions and queries in computation process,” he said. More importantly, it may not be possible to get a bell-shaped curve in distribution of marks. It may be negatively skewed which means there will be more students getting 90% or 95% marks. “To avoid the crazy situation in undergraduate admissions, moderation of marks is extremely important, after carefully adding primary and secondary data so that it gives a resemblance of a bell-shaped distribution,” Ganguly said. To do away with disparity in evaluation of Class 12 results, Lucknow University vice-chancellor Prof Alok Rai announced holding of entrance tests for UG admissions which are likely to be held in August. “With entrance tests, students can get admission to good institutions based on merit which is ignored in their marksheet this year,” Prof Rai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/board-assessment-criteria-workable-but-caution-must/articleshow/84393053.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man who assaulted doctor granted bail||MUMBAI: A sessions court has granted bail to a man accused of manhandling and assaulting a doctor at Sion hospital after his 66-year-old father died from a kidney ailment last month. While the court held that attacking doctors was objectionable, it said, considering the nature of the allegation and the loss of the father, bail can be granted. Granting relief to Saki Naka resident Roshan Gupta, the court said, “The conduct of the applicant towards the treating doctor is sheerly highly objectionable. They cannot intrude in the hospital administration. If one’s life is lost in hospital due to some disease, the Doctor cannot be assaulted. There is a legal way to vindicate the grievance about any negligent act.” Gupta was arrested on June 28. He was booked for offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss to Property Act. The incident took place on June 25, 2021. Gupta and his brother argued with the doctor and the former pulled his collar and manhandled him, the prosecution said. “On going through the police report, it appears that applicant and his brother were charging towards treating doctor due to sad demise of their father at the age of 66 years," the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-who-assaulted-doctor-granted-bail/articleshow/84394709.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||India||Congress wants 2 of its ministers in Maharashtra cabinet replaced||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray may soon reshuffle his cabinet, particularly the Congress ministers following a plea by the party. A Congress minister told TOI on Tuesday said the AICC has proposed a reshuffle among Congress cabinet members. “It has been proposed to drop two cabinet members and induct two new ministers in their place,” he said. The Congress minister said the AICC recently took a review of the performance of all the Congress cabinet members and felt it was time to drop non-performing ministers. “It was felt that some Congress cabinet members were not visible during the pandemic. Congress has already prepared the list of ministers who will be dropped. All will depend on the availability of the CM and the governor for the purpose,” the minister said. Secondly, the minister said the AICC is keen on early elections for the speaker’s post which was earlier held by Congress’ Nana Patole, who has been appointed as state party president. Patole is keen that he is inducted into the state cabinet, the minister said. “Senior AICC leaders Malikarjun Kharge and H K Patil, who were in Mumbai, discussed the political situation and the possibility of a small reshuffle,” he said. The minister said it has been proposed that instead of holding a secret ballot for the speaker’s election, the election should be held by raising of hands so that there is no scope for cross-voting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-wants-2-of-its-ministers-in-maharashtra-cabinet-replaced/articleshow/84395723.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||No deaths from six seasonal maladies in 6 months, says BMC||MUMBAI: No deaths due to common seasonal ailments such as malaria, leptospirosis, dengue or H1N1 have been recorded in the first six months of the year in the city. Mumbai has seen a significant drop in deaths as well as cases of monsoon-related diseases since the pandemic struck, but doctors caution a decline in diagnosis or reporting could be responsible. According to data released by the BMC on Tuesday, not a single death has been attributed to malaria, leptospirosis, dengue, hepatitis, gastroenteritis and H1N1 this year till July 11 (see box). In most of these diseases, deaths are largely recorded between June and September. In 2020, a remarkable decline in monsoon diseases was noted, barring malaria. A stringent lockdown was stated as one of the reasons why the transmission of diseases was lesser. Malaria was the only disease that saw a rise and one death was reported last year. The city had not recorded a single malaria death in 2019, which was a first in a decade. Interestingly, the other vector-borne disease, dengue, saw the sharpest drop as cases fell by nearly 86%. From 920 confirmed cases in 2019, it dropped to 129 in 2020. Both these years saw three dengue deaths each. Cases of gastroenteritis declined by 67% -- from 7,785 in 2019 to 2,549 in 2020. A similar drop was seen in the incidence of hepatitis with cases plummeting to 263 last year from 1,534 in 2019. As coronavirus became the dominant virus, influenza H1N1 saw fewer detections. There were 451 cases and five deaths in 2019, which came down to 44 cases and zero deaths in 2020. Infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who has been a part of the BMC’s death audit committees, said it was unlikely deaths due to all other diseases would disappear. “The issue of underreporting must be looked at because doctors are definitely treating cases of malaria,” he said. A civic official said wards in the island city have been reporting malaria cases, particularly from A, B and F-south wards. Leptospirosis, too, has been a cause for worry this year. The civic official said a spurt is usually seen after days of heavy rainfall, which the city recorded in June. As many as 30 of the 74 leptospirosis cases have come in the last 40 days. A few deaths may be under review before they are attributed to any of these diseases, the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-deaths-from-six-seasonal-maladies-in-6-months-says-bmc/articleshow/84391044.cms||---

---||Noida||Noida: Sub-inspectors can become in-charges of 50% police stations now||NOIDA: The UP government has decided to officially do away with a rule that made it mandatory for at least two-thirds of police stations in every district to have officers in the rank of an inspector as in-charge. The order, issued by additional chief secretary Awanish Awasthi on Tuesday, said that if “capable” inspectors were not available, those in the rank of sub-inspectors could also be made in-charges of 50% of the police stations. “Postings of inspectors and sub-inspectors be done on the basis of their suitability, capability, diligence, truthfulness, efficiency and practicality. This will lead to encouragement to those inspectors and sub-inspectors who perform better and others will get encouraged to perform well,” the order reads. The order elicited a mixed response from police officers posted in Noida. While those in the sub-inspector level said the decision would push them to perform better, their seniors in the level of inspector said the order would hardly make any difference in policing because many sub-inspectors had already been posted as in-charges of police stations. “This is a welcome move for officers like us. But sub-inspectors were already being posted as in-charges of several police stations. The order will bring little difference. The only change is that sub-inspectors will now have a higher chance of getting posted as police station in-charge,” an officer said. At present, Noida has 7 sub-inspectors serving as in-charge of police stations. It was in 2013 that the government made it mandatory for inspectors to be made in-charges of at least two-third police stations in each district. There was a spate of promotions and there were too many inspector-level officers all of a sudden. “So, this rule was introduced to accommodate those who had become officers in the level of inspector all of a sudden. At least two-thirds of police stations had inspectors to take charge of them. However, in many districts now, sub-inspectors are being given charge of police stations,” said another officer. Some cops pointed out that officers getting the charge of police stations was solely at the discretion of their seniors. In several police stations, they said, officers with more experience were serving under inspectors or sub-inspectors who had fewer years in service. “Giving a charge is more about the discretion of the top-level officer of a district and the perception of the inspector or sub-inspector before the police chief. At present, many sub-inspectors are being given charge of police stations. The latest move can demoralise those in the rank of inspectors,” an officer pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/sis-can-become-in-charges-of-50-police-stations-now/articleshow/84393134.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Delhi||Delhi rains: Mercy from above, familiar woes on ground||NEW DELHI: The arrival of the monsoons in Delhi on Tuesday brought a long-awaited respite from the high temperatures but there was the usual demerit too: waterlogging at various places in the city that caused the traffic to crawl. A lot of water had accumulated near the AIIMS flyover, Pul Prahladpur, Mundka railway bridge, Ring Road, Vikas Marg and Kirari, among other places, mocking the claims of PWD and the municipal corporations at having unclogged the stormwater drains. The preparatory arrangements at Minto Bridge proved to be sufficient, however, with this vulnerable site experiencing no flooding on Tuesday. A PWD official claimed that after being directed to ensure no waterlogging on the streets during the rains, the agency had made elaborate arrangements to deal with the flooding, which was tested today by the heavy rain. The second most affected site during the rains — Pul Prahladpur — continued to be a trouble area and traffic had to be diverted to other roads. The monsoon reports from the municipal corporations indicate that the impact of rains was much heavier in south Delhi. The official monsoon report of South Delhi Municipal Corporation said that waterlogging complaints were received from places like East of Kailash, Munirka, Shivalik Road, Malviya Nagar, Asola, Vasant Kunj, Rajpur Khurd and Badarpur. Since the waterlogging occurred after the morning rains and before the evening peak traffic hour, it led to snarls and delays for many commuters. The civic body also registered four cases of tree felling in some places, including RPS Colony, Sheikh Sarai Phase 1, Kailash Colony, I Block Jangpura Extension and D Block Lajpat Nagar. Two cases of buildings being damaged by the heavy rain have been recorded at Savitri Nagar and Hauz Khas. A senior municipal official said that the waterlogging at these spots was temporary and occurred due to abnormally heavy precipitation, with the water draining way later. The monsoon report from the north corporation stated that no waterlogging complaints were received from City-SP, Karol Bagh and Keshavpuram zones, only from other places like MC Primary School Mubarakpur, Majlis Park, Karala and Mundka. A civic official said that these were low-lying areas and pumps had been installed to clear the water within a few hours. The spokesperson of EDMC claimed that no monsoon-related complaints had been received from Shahdara North and Shahadra South zones. The official monsoon report also recorded zero cases of waterlogging, tree felling and damaged structures. EDMC officials said that very light rain was recorded in the trans-Yamuna areas. PWD officials said only minor waterlogging complaints were reported and water was removed at such spots. They said around 147 vulnerable locations had been identified as being prone to waterlogging. “All necessary arrangements have been made. Field staff are regularly visiting these areas. CCTV cameras have also been installed at about 20 most vulnerable locations for real time, round-the-clock monitoring for waterlogging,” an official asserted. A Delhi government official said that necessary instructions had been issued to all departments concerned, including PWD and flood & irrigation control, to ensure that the water did not collect on the streets. Wherever waterlogging occurs, the roads should be cleared within 10-15 minutes, the officials were instructed. PWD has installed 1,500 pumps at vulnerable locations to get rid of the water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mercy-from-above-familiar-woes-on-ground/articleshow/84391058.cms||---

The Tirupur city cybercrime police said 42-year-old D Senthil Kumar, of Kolathur in Chennai, had befriended the girl in Tirupur on WeChat in 2014 and she used to make obscene video calls to him on his request. “He used to record them. In 2019, he met the minor girl in Tirupur and raped her on several occasions,” an investigation officer said. The girl, who is now a major, had married another person a few months ago. “Senthil Kumar had contacted her recently, asking her to make obscene video calls. When she refused, he threatened to upload the videos that he had recorded in the past on social media.” The woman’s younger sister lodged a complaint with the Tirupur city cybercrime police on Monday morning. They registered a first information report and arrested Senthil Kumar on Tuesday. “He was booked under various sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, Information Technology Act, Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act and the Indian Penal Code, and lodged in Tirupur district jail under judicial custody,” the officer said.

---||Ghaziabad||Five Ghaziabad traffic cops suspended for extortion bid||GHAZIABAD: Five traffic policemen, including three head constables and two constables, have been suspended for allegedly trying to extort money from cloth traders after they were stopped during checking in Masuri at NH-9.  On Tuesday, TOI reported that four traders from Garh Mukteshwar made a complaint to Dr Iraj Raja, SP (rural), that five traffic cops had stopped them on NH-9 in Masuri on Sunday and demanded Rs 20,000 to let them go. The traders were carrying Rs 2.3 lakh worth cash with them, which they said was to purchase some goods from Delhi. They alleged that the traffic cops stopped them saying it was a weekend lockdown and then asked for Rs 20,000. They later scaled down their demand to Rs 12,000. When the traders refused to pay the amount, the cops took them to Masuri police station and threatened to implicate all of them in a false case and seized the bag of cash as well. Dr Iraj Raja on Tuesday sent a report on the issue after which Amit Pathak, DIG & SSP (Ghaziabad), had taken action. The suspended cops are identified as — three head constables — Sudhir Singh, Parag Kumar, Sandeep Kumar while two constables are — Tinku Kumar and Devendra Singh. Moreover, due to negligence in the case, traffic inspector Paramhans Tiwar will pay his 30-day salary as a fine. Pathak said that a departmental enquiry will be done by SP (law) and further action will be taken against these cops after that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/five-gzb-traffic-cops-suspended-for-extortion-bid/articleshow/84393152.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

The incident happened in front of Gaur City 10th Avenue society when the woman was buying vegetables around 8.30 pm on Monday. The accused men allegedly pushed the woman to the ground when she tried to spot them. Sonam Mishra and her domestic helper were near the society gate buying vegetables when two men came on a bike and suddenly pulled at her gold chain. Sonam’s husband Utkarsh said that she tried to stop the men but they pushed her to the ground. Soon after the incident, a police team from Bisrakh reached the spot. ACP-2 (central Noida) Yogendra Singh said that while checking the cameras installed at the society, they found only one camera installed at one gate had footage relevant to the case. “The footage has been accessed but it is unclear. Moreover, the two assailants had both covered their faces,” he said.

---||Kochi||One more arrested in Karipur gold smuggling||KOCHI: The customs team probing the Karipur gold smuggling case arrested one more person in connection with the case on Tuesday. Ajmal, a native of Panur in Kannur, was arrested by the customs team after finding his alleged involvement in the gold smuggling. Ajmal will be produced at Ernakulam additional chief judicial magistrate (economic offences) on Wednesday. Earlier on Monday night, customs took Ajmal and his friend Ashique into custody. After an interrogation that lasted nearly nine hours, customs recorded Ajmal’s arrest and let off Ashique. According to customs, the SIM cards used by Ajmal for gold smuggling-related conversations were taken in his mother Sakina’s name. Sakina was questioned by customs on Monday. Sources said that Ajmal had recruited Shafeeque, who was intercepted at the Karipur airport, as the carrier of the smuggled gold. It is learnt that Ajmal provided SIM cards taken in his mother’s name to Arjun Ayanki and Mohammed Shafi too. Customs sources said that Ajmal used the alias Mohammed to contact Shafeeque and give him directions. Also, he gave details of the persons to whom the gold must be delivered after landing at Karipur airport. Customs said that Ashique was released after questioning as his involvement in the case is limited. Ajmal had close contacts with Ayanki and Shafi. It was Ajmal who introduced Shafeeque to Ayanki. Ajmal has close contact with the agent in Dubai who arranges carriers for smuggling gold. He will have to be interrogated again to find more details, customs source said. Shafi interrogatedMeanwhile, customs let off Mohammed Shafi, a convict in the TP Chandrashekaran murder case, after interrogating him on Tuesday. Shafi, who appeared for questioning at the customs office around 10:45 am was questioned for nearly eight hours. Though there were reports that he would be arrested, the customs let him go by 8pm. “Shafi needs to be questioned again and we are collecting more details about his involvement in the case. He will be summoned again soon,” a customs official said. The customs decided to question Shafi after finding that he and Kodi Suni, another convict in TP murder case, were protecting the gang involved in gold smuggling in Kannur. Customs had summoned Shafi last week but he skipped interrogation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/one-more-arrested-in-karipur-gold-smuggling/articleshow/84388645.cms||---

The Madukkarai police said the seven-member gang, led by Suraj alias Ansar, had created an account on OLX and placed an advertisement to sell pickup trucks. Sujith Kumar, who runs a courier service in Kerala, contacted Suraj after seeing advertisement. “Suraj agreed to sell the pickup trucks to Sujith and invited him to come in front of Karpagam Medical College and Hospital near Madukkarai,” a police officer attached to Madukkarai police station said. Sujith, along with his three friends, including Sunil Kumar, reached Karpagam College in a car on July 7. Suraj also reached there with two of his accomplices and informed Sujith that the pickup trucks were in a nearby garage. The trio went in the car with Sujith and Sunil to the garage, leaving Sujith’s other two friends near the college. When the car reached an isolated place, Suraj and friends thrashed Sujith and Sunil, stole three mobile phones, Rs3 lakh and the car. They dumped Suraj and Sunil on Pollachi-Palakkad highway and sped off,” the officer said. Sujith immediately lodged a complaint with the Madukkarai police. During a vehicle check at Madukkarai check post, police nabbed the seven-member gang while they were travelling in a truck. Police have recovered all the stolen items from the gang.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/gang-involved-in-car-mobile-thefts-busted/articleshow/84391050.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Preterm baby with heart defect gets new lease of life in Coimbatore||COIMBATORE: A city hospital has successfully performed a surgery on a baby boy weighing just 910g who was born preterm with a heart defect known as patent ductus arteriosus. It is a condition where there is a persistent connection between the two blood vessels leaving the heart, leading to too much blood flow into the lungs. The surgery was performed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) itself to avoid shifting, which could have led to complications. Born to a couple from Andhra Pradesh at the PSG Hospitals in the city on the 25th week of pregnancy, many organs of the child were immature. “Ductus arteriosus is a normal umbilical artery supplying oxygen-rich blood to the fetus. It usually closes itself within a few days of delivery,” says Dr Vinoth Doraisamy, senior consultant paediatric cardiologist at the hospital. “However, preterm babies are prone to incomplete closure of this artery and as a result too much blood flow into the lungs.” The baby, who was in the NICU for a few weeks, had developed a lung infection. Even after a course of antibiotic therapy, the baby was dependent on the ventilator because of the patent ductus arteriosus. “That’s when we decided to surgically close the connecting artery,” says Dr C Ananthanarayanan, senior consultant cardiothoracic surgeon at the hospital. “But it was technically challenging to shift the baby to the operation theatre, which was on a different floor. The baby’s organ systems were so immature that shifting to a different floor could have led to hypothermia or low body temperature with serious consequences. The child’s lung was also in a bad state that it could not have withstood even minimal movement of tubes during the shifting. So, we arranged an operation theatre set-up in the NICU itself.” The hospital sealed off the baby’s portion of the ICU cabin, and the surgeon had to operate the baby on the ICU bed, which couldn’t be turned, making it physically difficult. The hour-long procedure was uneventful. “The baby is slowly recovering,” says Dr Ananthanarayanan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/preterm-baby-with-heart-defect-gets-new-lease-of-life/articleshow/84391066.cms||---

---||Kochi||SC agrees to examine if UAPA is applicable||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to examine whether UAPA, a stringent anti-terror law, is applicable in gold smuggling cases, in the backdrop of conflicting rulings by two high courts. A bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana agreed to examine the issue, in view of applications filed by the Centre and the NIA, stating that UAPA is applicable in gold smuggling cases. However, the top court declined to cancel the bail granted to 12 accused in the controversial case pertaining to smuggling of gold through diplomatic baggage from UAE to Thiruvananthapuram. Notice has been sent to all the 12 accused who were granted bail. The Centre and the NIA, before the top court, pointed out at confusion arising out of the rulings of two high courts –– Rajasthan and Kerala –– which arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions. In February this year, the Kerala high court, while granting bail to the 12 accused, had observed that gold smuggling does not come under the purview of terrorism. “We are unable to hold that smuggling of gold simpliciter will fall within Section 15(1)(a) (iiia) of UA(P) Act,” the high court had said. The court added that gold smuggling, clearly covered by the provisions of the Customs Act, will not fall within the definition of terrorist act in Section 15 of UA(P) Act unless evidence is brought out to show that it is done with the intent to threaten, or it is likely to threaten the economic security or monetary stability of India. On the contrary, the Rajasthan high court, in February, had ruled that a gold smuggler prosecuted under Customs Act could also be prosecuted under UAPA. The high court had refused to quash the FIR registered by the NIA under the offences of UAPA. Mohammad Aslam, the petitioner, was caught at Jaipur International Airport for smuggling over 1.5kg gold. The high court rejected Aslam’s plea contending that registering the case under UAPA would amount to “double jeopardy”, as he was already facing prosecution under the Customs Act. The high court had noted that smuggling gold with the intent to threaten the economic security of the country can be termed as a “terrorist act” under UAPA. Aslam had moved the top court, seeking stay of investigation and the proceedings connected with FIR, which was registered by NIA under provisions of the UAPA. In March, a bench headed by Justice R F Nariman issued notice on his plea.agencies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sc-agrees-to-examine-if-uapa-is-applicable/articleshow/84388743.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CM Uddhav Thackeray says look at Goregaon as an option for Metro 3, 6 shed||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has asked Metro officials to explore the option of setting up a car depot for the Metro 3 underground corridor (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) and Metro 6 (Vikhroli to Lokhandwala) at Goregaon Pahadi as the Kanjurmarg land is stuck in litigation. A review meeting was chaired by Thackeray on Monday to ascertain the pace of the Metro projects, including depot locations for several lines. TimesViewThe Shiv Sena-led alliance earned accolades from green activists when it scrapped the Metro 3 car shed from the Aarey green belt but now finds itself in a bind trying to find an alternative site. The crucial project is already staring at several years of delay because of indecision. This is unacceptable. The MVA government must set a strict timeline to get the project back on track.“The CM wants other options to be on the table as Kanjurmarg land is not readily available. For Metro 4 (Wadala-Thane) too other options for a depot will be explored,” a state government official said. Thackeray asked the urban development department to bring before the cabinet a note for approval of the increased cost of Metro 3. The cost of this project has increased by Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 33,406 crore from the original estimate of Rs 23,136 crore. At Goregaon Pahadi the government had sought to reserve 89 hectares of 129.10 hectares of a no-development zone (NDZ) for a metro yard. The balance 40 hectares is proposed to be given for setting up of the Maharashtra National Law University. The NDZ has been converted to a residential zone and the land reserved for the university and metro and mono rail yard and ancillary activities. At Kanjurmarg, the MMRDA had planned a car shed for Line 6 and on October 11 it decided to have a shed for Metro 3 as well, after the state government stayed the work at the Aarey depot. On December 16, the high court stayed the suburban district collector’s order that allotted 102 acres of salt pan land in Kanjurmarg for the construction of an integrated Metro car shed. The court has not yet vacated the stay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cm-says-look-at-goregaon-as-an-option-for-metro-3-6-shed/articleshow/84391098.cms||---
---||Goa||In 1 year, Goa diverted near 150 hectare forest land for power projects||PANAJI: The country’s tiniest state with an area of 3,702 sqkm has diverted nearly 150 hectare of forest land, rich in biodiversity and home to many endemic animals and plants, for power projects last year—the third highest just behind Arunachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, which are 23- and 66-times Goa’s size, respectively. When it comes to diversion of forest land for any linear project—road, rail, power or water—Goa is among the top 10 in the country, according to a report by the Delhi-based Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment. The only proposed diversion in Goa rejected by any of the committees was to carry out mining near the Bondla wildlife sanctuary. “Three projects for transmission lines diverting area of 69.41 hectares, 48.3 hectares and 28.24 hectares, lying contiguous to each other, were approved in the North and South districts of Goa in April 2020 by regional empowered committee (REC) Bengaluru. The recommendation for diversion of 69.41 hectares of forest land for laying the Xeldem to Mapusa transmission line has also been given,” said the report. The report said that the diverted area appeared to be frequented by wild animals like Indian gaur, leopard, wild boar, sambar deer, jungle hare, snakes and avifauna. However, the North Goa deputy conservator of forests said there were no direct sightings during the site inspections. But the deputy conservator agreed that tigers, panthers, gaurs, leopards, sloth bears, pythons, slender loris and white bellied woodpeckers are present in and around the forest land proposed for diversion. The construction of Xeldem transmission line would divert 48.3 hectare of moderate to very dense forest land, of which 36.76 hectare would be from the North Goa forest division and 11.54 hectare from the Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary. “The forest land supports a canopy density of 0.8 and the project will entail felling of 15,772 trees,” the Delhi-based agency said. The report has analysed all permissions for forest clearance granted throughout 2020 across the country by the forest advisory committee (FAC) and the regional empowered committee (REC), which are constituted under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. While nearly 400 hectares of forest land was recommended in 2020 for diversion in Arunachal Pradesh for power transmission lines and Uttar Pradesh diverted more than 310ha, Goa diverted 146.5 hectares for a power line project. The only rejection of forest land in Goa by REC Bengaluru was the 2 hectares of deemed forest in Sattari taluka for quarrying purpose “The proposed area is located near Bondla wildlife sanctuary. The area is on a slope and receives heavy rainfall. Along with ecological reasons, non-compliance of conditions imposed related to planting (plantation of 10 times the number of trees felled for approval granted for diversion of 0.9 hectares) is the cause of rejection,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-1-yr-goa-diverted-nearly-150haof-forest-land-for-power-projects/articleshow/84391084.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

A police officer said A Elumalai, a resident of Fairlands in the city, was having an illicit affair with R Chitra, of Karuppur, who was running a petty shop. “She had separated from her husband Rajendran, 45, a few years ago and been living with her 20-year-old daughter and a 17-year-old son. The officer said Chitra’s daughter was opposed to her mother’s illicit relationship. “So, when Elumalai visited her house on Monday morning, Chitra asked him not to visit her at the house anymore. Infuriated, Elumalai suddenly stabbed her, killing her on the spot, and fled.” When alerted, the Karuppur police registered a case and launched a manhunt for the accused. “We traced Elumalai’s hideout and arrested him the same night,” the officer said.

Though it was described as a courtesy visit, according to reports, the three leaders told Pawar that the statement made by Patole was twisted by a section of the media. Patil also had a series of meetings with Congress leaders and activists over the ensuing elections to local bodies. On Patole’s statement, Patil said it was unfortunate that the statement was twisted for political reasons. “Patole has already clarified his position. His target was the Narendra Modi-led NDA government and not the MVA government,” he said. On the speaker’s post, Patil claimed there was no dispute, and as decided by the MVA partners, it will remain with Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-leaders-meet-sharad-pawar-try-to-clear-air-on-nana-patoles-being-watched-statement/articleshow/84395744.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar
---||Ranchi||Limited stocks in Jharkhand to affect vaccine drive||RANCHI: Operating on a limited stock of Covishield vaccines provided by the state health department a day earlier, the vaccination sites across Ranchi struggled to manage the serpentine queues of beneficiaries as on Tuesday. It was a tightrope walk for the health workers manning the city’s 19 session sites which had opened for inoculating the urban beneficiaries. Braving the scorching sun and bouts of rain, beneficiaries of all age groups above 18 years queued outside for their jabs. With the district having little or no stock of Covaxin, a large chunk of beneficiaries who were due for their second doses were turned away. With only 22,000 doses of Covishield, it was a tough ask for the health workers to ration the doses between beneficiaries who were due for their second dose and those who had turned up for their first. “Most session sites operated on first-come-first-serve basis,” a senior official in the district health services said. Septuagenarian Manoj Kumar, a resident of Dhurwa’s Sector 3 area, had turned up with his wife, Sarla Devi, at the HEC wellness center for their second doses of Covishield. “We had to wait for more than an hour to get our doses,” Manoj said. Laxman Xalxo, who arrived at the government middle school campus in Doranda’s BMP1 campus, was turned away. “I was told that due to shortage of vaccines, only first doses were being given. I had gone there to get my second dose,” Xalxo said. Ranchi civil surgeon Dr Vinod Kumar hinted that the crisis for vaccines will prevail on Wednesday. “We had received 22,000 doses of Covishield on Monday, of which 21,500 doses had been distributed for vaccinations on Tuesday. We will not be getting any fresh batch of Covishield today. We are due to get 2,500 doses of Covaxin tomorrow. So, the vaccination will take place consisting the Covaxin doses and the left over stock of Covishield at the session sites,” Kumar added. The state health department on Tuesday said it has distributed 4 lakh doses of Covaxin among 24 districts. Ranchi was allotted 3,400 doses, the highest, followed by Dhanbad at 2,900. The state has a daily target of vaccinating 1.18 lakh people while it had 3.52 lakh doses, enough to last less than three days, the department claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/limited-stocks-in-state-to-affect-vaccine-drive/articleshow/84389423.cms||---

Nearly 150-200 deaths occur annually due to lightning strikes, even after timely warnings by the weather office. “During our study we found that Jharkhand, being on a plateau and surrounded by water bodies or isolated tall trees in open fields, attract lightning,” said weather scientist at Birsa Agriculture University, Dr Abdul Wadood, who headed a project on identification of lightning sensitive areas in the state. Wadood believes that the most essential part is creating awareness in rural areas. The project, taken up in 2008 following a lightning strike which killed students in a Namkom school, was monitored by Jharkhand High Court. It was then that lightning sensors were installed at seven places for predicting possible lightning and issuing alerts. Wadood also pointed out that loads of minerals can play a role in attracting lightning but no specific study with hydrology or minerology in mind has been conducted yet. “Though we had created a lightning map, it was found that issuing warning was of no help unless the people knew about the dos and don’ts,” Wadood said pointing to the death of 11 people in different parts of the state on July 4, earlier this month. Acting director of Ranchi IMD, Abhishek Anand, said that the meteorological department has upto-date apparatus and sensors to predict lightning well in advance. “We have been issuing alerts whenever there is a chance of thunderstorms,” he said. Convener of Lightning Resilient India Campaign, Col Sanjay Srivastava, agreed that awareness played a crucial role in avoiding fatalities due to lightning. He flagged off a Vajrapat Jagrukta Rath alongside Ranchi deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan on July 7 to create awareness in the rural areas of Ranchi. “The Lightning Resilient India Campaign is being supported by IMD, ministry of earth sciences, Unicef, Red Cross and others,” he said. Wadood pointed out that wall graffiti about dos and don’ts, putting up hoardings in village haats and announcements through the public address system could go a long way to tell people that they should not take shelter under trees during rain. “During our study we found that 65-70 per cent of the deaths occurring due to lightning were linked to taking shelter under the trees,” he said. Explaining the reason for trees and ponds attracting lightning, he said that moving clouds often develop charge and the negative ions are towards the bottom of the cloud mass, facing the earth. “Though everything on earth is neutral, including the trees but when a negatively charged mass of cloud comes close to the trees it repels the negative ions of the tree towards the ground making the canopy positively charged. When the potential difference between the cloud and tree top increases beyond a certain limit, there is a di-electric breakdown of the bad conductor air column allowing huge amount of electricity to flow down into the earth, through the tree,” he said. “I advise them to get away from water-stagnated fields, ponds and higher places. Pucca buildings and dry flat areas are safer,” Wadood said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/awareness-key-to-preventing-deaths-due-to-lightning-in-jharkhand-weather-experts/articleshow/84401769.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

SP (Dhanbad city) R Ramkumar said the accused was caught on Monday night and sent to judicial custody on Tuesday. He said police took the support of counsellor cum advocate Lopamudra to talk to the survivor. Based on their conversation, police confirmed that the woman was raped and lodged a case based on a complaint filed by police inspector Pawan Kumar Choudhary. Ramkumar further said Das was arrested from Bhuli locality from where he was trying to flee with his ambulance. The SP said Das confessed his crime to the police and released the tea joint owner, who was previously thought of as Das’s accomplice, as his involvement in the crime could not be established. Earlier, the SNMMCH management had launched an internal inquiry into the incident. Meanwhile, Dhanbad ADM (law and order) Kumar Tarachand, SDO Surendra Prasad and ASP (law and order) Manoj Swargiyari reviewed the security measure of the SNMMCH on Tuesday and held long parleys with the medical college management, including heads of different departments, to devise ways and means to prevent such incidents in future. Trachaand has recommended increasing the number of home guard jawans on deputation to SNMMCH from the existing 30 to 50. The administration has also directed the SNMMCH administration to submit its inquiry report soon so that strict punitive action could be taken against hospital staff found guilty of dereliction of duty. The medical college management has reportedly also been directed to stop the entry of unwanted persons, including touts of private medicine shop owners, pathology and radiology centres and ambulance drivers, inside the wards.

Speaking at the launch of the 72nd Van Mahotsav in Gandhi Gram near Getalsud Dam in Angara block of Ranchi district, Soren said nearly 1 lakh saplings will be planted in Ranchi alone. “The forest department aims to plant over 1.5 crore saplings across Jharkhand during the monsoon season this year. While coming to this event, I directed all the officials of the department to ensure that saplings are planted in all vacant lands in the urban areas that are owned by the government,” Soren said. Stating that urban afforestation is the only way forward, Soren also called upon the residents to actively engage in plantation drives. “Plantations need to be taken up actively in the rural areas of the state. Although there are several plantation programmes which are run by the forest department and the state horticulture mission from time to time, most exist only in paper,” Soren said. “The department now will have to distribute saplings of fruit-bearing trees in rural areas periodically with the help of local legislators, village mukhiyas and locals. The coverage of Mukhyamantri Jan Van Yojana needs to be increased,” he added. Notably, the scheme entails up to 75% financial subsidy by the state government if a beneficiary aims to plant fruit-bearing trees on their land for livelihood generation. Speaking at the event, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) P K Verma said the department aims to plant 1.7 crore saplings statewide during the monsoon. “The importance of this particular exercise can be gauged from the fact that Jharkhand’s forest cover has increased by 1,625 square kilometre in the past 20 years,” Verma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/all-vacant-govt-land-in-cities-to-have-green-cover-soren/articleshow/84389347.cms||---

Pucca buildings and dry flat areas are safer,” Wadood said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/awareness-key-to-preventing-deaths-due-to-lightning-in-jharkhand-weather-experts/articleshow/84389271.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

In a bid to create a Covid-free campus, PU promoted vaccination of not just university staff members and students but even parents and relatives of students, officials said. “We have been regularly monitoring and updating records of registrations and vaccinations of all stakeholders and providing them guidance,” said PU president Dr Devanshu Patel, who was the first one to take the shot at the campus. “As many as 19,452 of our students have positively responded and complied with vaccination registration procedures. From a total of 63,625 family members of our students whose records are maintained, the drive has encouraged 60,392 to register for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/most-students-staff-at-pu-get-covid-19-jabs/articleshow/84386467.cms||---
---||Jamshedpur||Limited stocks in Jharkhand to affect vaccine drive||RANCHI: Operating on a limited stock of Covishield vaccines provided by the state health department a day earlier, the vaccination sites across Ranchi struggled to manage the serpentine queues of beneficiaries as on Tuesday. It was a tightrope walk for the health workers manning the city’s 19 session sites which had opened for inoculating the urban beneficiaries. Braving the scorching sun and bouts of rain, beneficiaries of all age groups above 18 years queued outside for their jabs. With the district having little or no stock of Covaxin, a large chunk of beneficiaries who were due for their second doses were turned away. With only 22,000 doses of Covishield, it was a tough ask for the health workers to ration the doses between beneficiaries who were due for their second dose and those who had turned up for their first. “Most session sites operated on first-come-first-serve basis,” a senior official in the district health services said. Septuagenarian Manoj Kumar, a resident of Dhurwa’s Sector 3 area, had turned up with his wife, Sarla Devi, at the HEC wellness center for their second doses of Covishield. “We had to wait for more than an hour to get our doses,” Manoj said. Laxman Xalxo, who arrived at the government middle school campus in Doranda’s BMP1 campus, was turned away. “I was told that due to shortage of vaccines, only first doses were being given. I had gone there to get my second dose,” Xalxo said. Ranchi civil surgeon Dr Vinod Kumar hinted that the crisis for vaccines will prevail on Wednesday. “We had received 22,000 doses of Covishield on Monday, of which 21,500 doses had been distributed for vaccinations on Tuesday. We will not be getting any fresh batch of Covishield today. We are due to get 2,500 doses of Covaxin tomorrow. So, the vaccination will take place consisting the Covaxin doses and the left over stock of Covishield at the session sites,” Kumar added. The state health department on Tuesday said it has distributed 4 lakh doses of Covaxin among 24 districts. Ranchi was allotted 3,400 doses, the highest, followed by Dhanbad at 2,900. The state has a daily target of vaccinating 1.18 lakh people while it had 3.52 lakh doses, enough to last less than three days, the department claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/limited-stocks-in-state-to-affect-vaccine-drive/articleshow/84401624.cms||---

The cases also include those referred by two district hospitals and private hospitals. MIS-C is linked to Covid-19 and can develop in children between two to four weeks after the infection, and in some cases six weeks later. “We had six cases in May and nine in June and there was one death. The other patients were cured and went home. The girl who died after developing MIS-C was five years old. She was brought to GMC in a critical stage,” head of the paediatric department at GMC, Dr Maria Silveira said. The rise in the MIS-C was expected as Goa witnessed a huge rise in Covid infections since April, touching a peak in May. Head of the paediatric department at Hospicio, Dr Ira Almeida said that since MIS-C develops within two to six weeks after Covid infection, and since the peak was in May, there were some cases in June. But this month, Almeida said that she hasn’t seen any cases. “Hopefully, there won't be any now, but those who got Covid at the end of June or this month, should be careful,” Almeida said. In June, she had referred two cases of MIS-C to GMC. Since Covid cases are likely to be more among children during the estimated third wave, a month ago, the state started preparations to treat paediatric cases. The process to set up a neonatal intensive care unit is underway at GMC’s super-speciality block, Silveira said. “Most of the things are already in place, but we haven’t started using the new facility and managing from GMC,” Silveira said. Paediatrician Dr Harshad Kamat said that after the second wave abated, he saw four cases in the age group of five to 16. “All four recovered after treatment. The 16-year-old was in the ICU, but he too improved and has gone home,” Kamat said. A senior paediatrician Dr Shivanand Gauns said that the most cases are likely to be referred to GMC because the drug used for the treatment of MIS-C — IVIG — is costly. “Even if a child weighs 20 kg, the cost of IVIG will come to about Rs 80,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Most parents can’t afford to pay so much. Private practitioners refer the cases to GMC,” Gauns said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/multisystem-inflammatory-syndrome-hits-states-kids/articleshow/84391362.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Goa||Don’t take lung disease lightly, it’s not common cold, say Goa doctors||PANAJI: Before the Covid pandemic swept across the state, people having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) could probably go about their lives with intermittent bouts of coughing and wheezing, and many, especially those living in rural areas, could easily brush the condition off as a common cold. But not any more. Doctors say the comorbidity should not be taken lightly as it increases the chances of aggravating one’s condition on testing positive for Covid-19. In fact, several people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have died during the pandemic, and most of these are from rural parts of the state. “The problem in Goa is that people are likely to dismiss COPD as a simple cold. We have seen many such patients, mostly senior citizens, from the peripheries of the state coming to us in critical condition, as late as on the eighth or a tenth day of contracting Covid-19,” Dr Rylind Pereira, a pulmonologist at the North Goa district hospital, told TOI. During the second Covid-19 wave, the hospital has handled over 800 infected patients, the majority of these coming from the peripheries of North Goa. Pereira said many patients who walk into the hospital with a positive Covid-19 report in hand still insist, ‘Mhaka matxi thandi zalea’ (I have a slight cold).” The hospital, he said, sees 15-18 patients with COPD each week — a majority of them women — coming from rural parts of Goa. “That’s because they (the women) generally use woodfired stoves to cook, while men are likely to have developed COPD due to their smoking habit. The condition is seen mostly after one turns 40,” Pereira said. Even though a patient may be coughing for three to four years and displays other classic symptoms of COPD, there are chances that the condition will be not taken seriously. “That’s because of the stigma attached to COPD and also because people do not like to acknowledge their condition,” he said. Another problem with rural patients, the pulmonologist said, is that they will most likely not be diagnosed in time as they will first go to their family doctor or try home remedies, and visit a hospital as the last resort. “But by that time, it may be too late.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-take-lung-disease-lightly-its-not-common-cold/articleshow/84391398.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Goa||Will lift curfew only when positivity drops further, says Goa CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Tuesday that the Covid case positivity rate is currently 3-4%, and would reduce further in the coming days. He said that only after it comes down further would the state-level curfew be withdrawn. A day after the state recorded zero Covid deaths for the first time in almost four months, Sawant said that it was “good news” and happened because of the doctors, nurses and others. “I congratulate the medical staff who have been working hard for past couple of months. It should remain the same (zero) and the positivity rate should (also) come down,” he said. The state’s death count had started rising in April as the second wave of the pandemic hit the state, and peaked in May, when it touched a single-day high of 75 fatalities. He also said that people should take precautions to bring down the state’s positivity rate. “It is the responsibility of the people to bring down the positivity rate, and the government (has) continuously (been) telling people to take precautions,” Sawant said. Sawant said that a decision, if any, to lift the curfew, would be taken after the discussion with the expert committee. The curfew is currently on till July 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-will-lift-curfew-only-when-vity-drops-further/articleshow/84391467.cms||---

A 28-year-old woman from Bardez who was obese and had hypertension was the youngest among the deceased. She died at GMC after a week’s treatment. A 37-year-old man from Ponda having a comorbidity, succumbed to the virus at GMC. His was a case of a late presentation. He was unwell for about 15 days but tested for Covid two days before he was hospitalised. Also, a 41-year-old woman from Kudal, Maharashtra, died while undergoing treatment at a private hospital in North Goa. She was diabetic. A 54-year-old man from Sakhali having comorbidities died at GMC. On Tuesday, Goa recorded as many as 164 new cases and 198 recoveries while the case positivity remained below 5%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/four-deaths-positivity-below-5/articleshow/84391488.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: MLAs approach chief secretary Parimal Rai over GMC vendors||PANAJI: St Andre MLA Francisco Silveira and St Cruz MLA Antonio Fernandes had a meeting with chief secretary Parimal Rai on Tuesday to discuss the rehabilitation of kiosk operators and fruit vendors who operated outside the Goa Medical College (GMC) before they were removed a week ago. Fernandes said they have submitted a plan to the chief secretary showing how the 15 fruit vendors and 39 kiosks could be accommodated. “The CS will conduct an inspection of the area. We need to rehabilitate them for the sake of humanity,” Fernandes said even as he admitted that they had been operating illegally. Fruit vendors, however, are already back doing business outside GMC. Most of the fruit vendors and kiosk owners are either from St Andre or St Cruz. Fernandes said the CM has assured them that the operators will be given a space to conduct their business. Since it is not feasible to allow them to operate from their old area, Fernandes said that he has suggested that it can be done by altering the hospital compound. “If portion of the wall is shifted within the hospital’s premises, it would make enough space available for installation of kiosks. I have given the drawings to the government,” he said. It was not known if the hospital administration was in favour of the suggestion. The immediate area within the compound wall is used for parking, but it is not sufficient and many vehicles park outside the compound. While initially a few kiosks were permitted — five kiosks under the Deen Dayal scheme — the numbers went up over the years, and while the GMC administration tried to remove them, it failed as they had the blessings of panchayats and politicians. The latter saw it as an opportunity for their constituents to earn a livelihood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mlas-approach-chief-secy-over-gmc-vendors/articleshow/84391536.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Waive visa, charter fees for three years, says GCCI to Centre||PANAJI: Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) has requested Union minister Shripad Naik to take steps to help revive Goa’s tourism sector. The Chamber has also submitted a written representation to Naik asking for changes to be brought in the Indian Ports Bill, 2021, which dilutes the powers of the maritime states. It has urged the Centre to waive off visa fees or substantially reduce them for three years so that Goa can attract international tourists post the pandemic. The other measures recommended are zero charter landing fees for three years, abolition of taxes on Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) and incentives for charter and tour companies. GCCI president Ralph De Souza has asked Naik, who has been appointed as the minister of state for shipping and waterways and tourism, to promote Goa as a cruise tourism destination. While calling for port fees at Mormugao Port Trust to be reduced, GCCI has also expressed concern over the Centre exercising greater control over the port. It has suggested that aside from the sole state representative on the Maritime State Development Council, each state should also nominate a representative from the private maritime sector. “The State Maritime Board being constituted should be autonomous and should comprise of non-political stakeholders,” said Souza. “We request that Goa Chamber of Commerce should be adequately represented on the Maritime Board.” GCCI has also asked Naik to fast track the national waterways project in six of Goa’s rivers under Sagarmala. Six existing minor ports should be restored and developed, said GCCI. It informed Naik that the container feeder ship movement is irregular and affects container traffic from Goa. “The container facility in MPT needs an upgrade. Proper container management can lure the Goan pharma companies,” said Souza.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/waive-visa-charter-fees-for-three-years-gcci-to-centre/articleshow/84391557.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Arvind Kejriwal meets Ramkrishna Dhavalikar, parties to explore pre-poll alliance for 2022||PANAJI: With a common aim to take on BJP in the upcoming assembly elections, Goa’s oldest regional party, MGP, and AAP are exploring the possibility of a pre-poll alliance. AAP’s national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who arrived on a two-day visit to Goa to review the party’s preparations for the 2022 polls, held a meeting with MGP’s senior functionaries, former deputy chief minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar, and his brother, MGP president Pandurang ‘Deepak’ Dhavalikar. The meeting went on for around 45 minutes. MGP tried to make light of the meeting. The former deputy CM said that they did not discuss active politics, and it was just a courtesy visit. “We have discussed each other’s work done in Goa and Delhi,” he said. During the meeting, both parties discussed the current political situation in the state, and how to go ahead in the future. MGP sources said that its functionaries told Kejriwal that they have to seek the opinion of the people before deciding on the alliance. A political observer said that while AAP is trying to expand its base in Goa, it would be interesting to see how the MGP-APP alliance takes shape. In the recently-concluded zilla panchayat election, AAP was able to open its account by winning the Benaulim seat when its 26-year-old candidate, Hanzel Feliciano Fernandes, won the three-cornered fight. “AAP has strong presence in South Goa, particularly in Salcete, whereas MGP is strong in Ponda and in North Goa,” the political observer said. Kejriwal was busy in the evening meeting with party functionaries and taking review of the work being done by AAP in the state. President of Association of Tourist Taxi Owners Chetan Kamat joined AAP. Earlier, undeterred by the inclement weather, large number of AAP volunteers gathered at the airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kejri-on-2-day-visit-to-goa-meets-dhavalikar-to-explore-tie-up-for-2022-polls/articleshow/84391642.cms||---
