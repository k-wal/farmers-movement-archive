---||World||Joe Biden to convene session on rising gun violence on Monday||WASHINGTON: Facing a nationwide increase in violent crime - particularly involving firearms - President Joe Biden will meet Monday with law enforcement, local elected officials and advocates to discuss his efforts to address gun crimes.  The White House says Biden will highlight his administration's push to increase funding for local law enforcement to improve community policing practices through the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill he signed into law earlier this year. Some states and local governments are also using funding from that so-called American Rescue Plan to fund youth employment programs and other measures that could help curtail crime.  The meeting comes as Biden has sought to flip the script on Republicans who have latched onto some progressive calls to "defund the police" amid a nationwide reckoning over police shootings of Black people. Biden has opposed "defund" efforts and instead has called on lawmakers to pass legislation aimed at reforming police departments, though that effort faces an uphill battle in Congress.  While the GOP has attacked Biden over rising crime, the White House is arguing that Republicans, who voted in lockstep against the Covid-19 relief bill, are the ones who tried to block increased funding for police.  Biden's budget request to Congress also calls for more funding for federal and state law enforcement, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to improve that agency's ability to track and disrupt gun trafficking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-to-convene-session-on-rising-gun-violence-on-monday/articleshow/84278559.cms||---

Addressing a press conference in Jammu and virtually in Srinagar, the commission members said the process will be completed in a transparent manner and the final draft will be put in public domain for objections and queries after associate members are consulted. After having threadbare discussions with political parties, civil society groups and NGO heads in the state, members of the commission hinted at giving due representation to the people belonging to Scheduled Tribe and Scheduled Caste groups in the newly-constituted Assembly. Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra, who is the ex-officio member of the commission, said: “In the past four days, we met 290 groups in Srinagar, Pahalgam, Kishtwar and Jammu. There was overwhelming response and people travelled long distances to meet us. We listened to every delegation.” Countering People's Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti's allegations that everything was pre-planned, said: “If things were decided earlier, the commission would not have come here. Nothing is pre-planned. Before starting the exercise, we want to have the views of all. The apprehensions in the mind of anyone, if at all, should go away,” he added. “In the last census, done in 2001, there were only 12 districts. The number of districts has now gone up to 12. Similarly, there were only 58 tehsils, which at present stands at 270,” he said. “Difficult terrains were not acknowledged in the earlier delimitation done in 1995. Population has to be the main criteria for delimitation but priority will also be on area, geography, topography and communication facilities of the areas,” he said. Chairperson of the commission, Justice (retd) Ranjana Prakash Desai said, “This is our first visit to J&K and I assure you, this is not the last, will come again to know the viewpoint of many more.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-delimitation-complex-issue-not-mere-arithmetic-says-panel/articleshow/84278455.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Pakistan’s coronavirus positivity rate has risen to 3.65% over the last 24 hours, the highest since June 4, with the country reporting over 1,500 cases for the third consecutive day. The daily reported cases in the country stood at around 700 last week. “Two weeks ago, I had tweeted that our artificial intelligence models are showing the possible emergence of a fourth wave. Now there are clear early signs of a fourth wave starting,” Asad Umar, minister for planning and development, said in a message posted on Twitter. The minister blamed poor compliance with coronavirus-related standard operating procedures (SOPs) and spread of virus variants, particularly Delta variant that was first detected in India, for the impending fourth wave. Field reports, according to the minister, were showing a complete disregard for the condition of vaccination for those attending indoor weddings, and going to indoor restaurants and gyms. “If the owners of these facilities do not show responsibility and ensure compliance, there will be no choice but to shut them down,” he said. A day earlier, PM Imran Khan, in a video message, had expressed serious concern over a looming fourth wave of Covid-19 and termed the Delta variant the biggest worry. Khan had referred to Afghanistan, Indonesia and other countries hit by the Delta variant. “We fear the Indian variant could strike Pakistan and as a precautionary measure, we need to adhere to the SOPs,” he had said. Earlier, the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), the nerve centre of Pakistan's coronavirus response, had confirmed the presence of different variants of the virus in Pakistan, including the Delta variant, Beta variant that was first detected in South Africa and the Alpha variant that was first found in the UK. The NCOC had said that these variants were detected in Pakistan in May and June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/authorities-warn-of-fourth-covid-wave-in-pakistan/articleshow/84278840.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The bear was shot by federal wildlife workers shortly after midnight when it approached a trap set near the coop about 2 miles (3 kilometers) from Ovando, where Leah Davis Lokan, 65, of Chico, California, was killed early Tuesday morning, said Greg Lemon with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.  The bear had raided the chicken coop overnight Wednesday, and officials set a baited trap nearby hoping to lure the animal back, Lemon said. Local authorities said a closure of campsites in town would continue until DNA evidence in the case is returned.  "Based on the size of the bear, the color of the bear and the nature of the chicken coop raids, we're confident we've got the offending bear," he said. Lemon said tracks found at the site of the coop also matched tracks found in Ovando.  The town along the banks of the Blackfoot River - made famous by the movie "A River Runs Through It" - has fewer than 100 people and borders a huge expanse of forested lands that stretches to the Canada border. The region is home to an estimated 1,000 grizzlies.  Bear attacks on humans are relatively rare, particularly in inhabited areas, and Ovando businesses cater to adventuresome tourists including bicyclists like Lokan who are allowed to pitch their tents in town.  Dona Aitken, an artist who lives about 7 miles (11 kilometers) east of Ovando, said the bear's death would bring relief to the community. Aitken sees grizzlies occasionally and signs of them such as droppings and tracks, but hasn't been bothered by them.  "Everybody recognizes this as really abnormal behavior to actually attack somebody sleeping in a tent in town," she said. "I think we still don't have a good answer for why he did that."  Investigators gathered DNA evidence from the scene of Lokan's death and will compare it to samples gathered from the dead grizzly bear, which was taken to a state wildlife laboratory in Bozeman for a necropsy, Lemon said. The results could be available in the next three days.  Until then, Powell County Sheriff Gavin Roselles said he would maintain a closure on outdoor campsites in Ovando.  Lokan, a registered nurse who had worked at a hospital in Chico, was an experienced outdoors woman and cyclist who was on a much-anticipated mountain biking trip. She and two companions were camped behind the Ovando post office early Tuesday when she was attacked.  Friends described Lokan as a free spirit and competitive - and aware of the dangers she faced on the trip.  "She had a really good spirit. She always had a smile on her face. Always lit up when she saw you. Always gave you a big hug," said Mike Castaldo, president of the Chico Cycling Team, who knew Lokan for about 15 years. "But I think most of her identity was, you know, outside on the bike, enjoying the outdoors was her thing."  The estimated 400-pound (181 kilogram) bear awakened Lokan and her companions in an adjacent tent about 3 a.m. Tuesday, officials said. After the bear ran away, the campers removed food from their tents, secured it and went back to sleep, Montana wildlife officials have said.  The bear was seen by a video camera at a business about a block away from the post office about 15 minutes later, wildlife officials said.  About 4:15 a.m., the sheriff's office received a 911 call after two people in a tent near the victim's were awakened by sounds of the attack, Roselles said. They discharged their bear spray, and the bear ran away.  The bear is also believed to have entered a chicken coop in town that night, killing and eating several chickens.  Authorities hunted for the animal over three days, using helicopters and search crews on the ground and set out five large traps made from steel culverts and baited with roadkill in an effort to attract the bear.  Bears that attack people are not always killed if the mauling resulted from a surprise encounter or the bear was defending its young. But the bear involved in Lokan's death was considered a public safety threat because of the circumstances of the attack.  On Thursday night, an Ovando-area woman came home and found her door ripped off and noticed large claw marks on the house, Roselles said.  Lemon said wildlife officials don't have enough evidence to draw any connection between the damage to the house and the bear that killed Lokan, because they don't know when the house was damaged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/grizzly-shot-killed-after-fatal-attack-of-california-woman/articleshow/84278843.cms||---

I hope Islamabad will persuade the Taliban for talks again,” Afghan foreign minister Hanif Atmar told a private Pakistani TV station on Friday. Prime Minister Imran Khan, however, had said several times that Washington’s pullout deadline from Afghanistan had diminished Islamabad’s leverage over Afghan insurgents. The situation in Afghanistan has become more volatile, with the Taliban launching a blistering campaign and capturing key districts of the country, in an escalated move as the US forces gradually withdraw from the country. Responding to a question whether the Afghan government thinks the US betrayed it, Atmar said that Washington had signed an agreement with the Taliban with honest intentions. “The Taliban did not fulfil their part of the deal and deceived the whole world. The Taliban are making a huge mistake. All of us have extended a hand of friendship towards them,” he said. He said the Afghan government was telling the Taliban to honour the Doha peace deal, adding that Kabul had fulfilled its obligations of the deal related to prisoners’ swap and ensuring exit of foreign troops from the country. The Afghan minister further said that the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and al-Qaeda have banded forces with other terrorist elements and are fighting alongside the Taliban against the Afghan government forces. “We are monitoring links between the TTP, Taliban and al-Qaeda on a daily basis,” Atmar said, adding that ties between these groups certainly exist. According to the minister, Afghan government has divided the militant groups of foreign fighters into different categories. “The first among them are the ones fighting for a global agenda, such as al-Qaeda and Daesh. Al-Qaeda and Daesh militants have their presence in the border areas between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” he said. “Then, we have regional players. The TTP, Lashkar-e-Tayyaba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), the Ansarullah and Jundullah,” said Atmar. “The entire region, not Afghanistan alone, is at threat from these groups. Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, India, Russia and the Middle East are in danger from these groups,” he said. The Afghan FM said that his country’s has spoken about regional cooperation to address the militancy problem without any discrimination of good or bad terrorists. “Peace between Afghanistan and the Taliban will ensure these elements do not find a safe haven in Afghanistan,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/kabul-seeks-islamabads-help-to-persuade-taliban-for-talks/articleshow/84278986.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||Senegal, EU and US sign deal for new vaccine-production plant||DAKAR: Senegal, the EU, the United States, several European governments, and other partners, signed an accord in the capital Dakar on Friday to finance vaccine production in the West African state. The move comes amid a shortages of jabs and a third wave of coronavirus infections sweeping Africa, which has highlighted the lack of vaccination-production facilities on the continent. Ninety-nine percent of vaccines used in Africa are imported, according to a joint statement from the Senegalese government and the European Union. The new financing deal is intended to kickstart vaccine production at the Pasteur Institute in Dakar, the statement explained, lowering the dependence on imports. Senegal's Economy Minister Amadou Hott was quoted in the statement as saying that the new production site will lay the foundation for "pharmaceutical and medical sovereignty". It will also "increase access to affordable vaccines in Africa, and enable vaccine production to rapidly respond to new pandemics," he added. Construction of the plant is expected to start later this year, according to the statement, which added that 25 million vaccine doses are due to be produced each month by the end of 2022. The European Commission, European Investment Bank, the World Bank, as well as the United States, France, Germany and Belgium will fund the project, alongside the Senegalese government and other donors. Germany will contribute 20 million euros ($23.7 million) towards the new plant. It is not yet clear how much other donors will contribute. However, several donors had already contributed millions towards a feasibility study. At a press conference in Dakar on Friday, European Commissioner Thierry Breton said the project should cost around 200 million euros ($237 million) in total. The plant will be situated in the new city of Diamniadio, about 30 kilometres (18 miles) from Dakar, and employ about 300 people, he added. "This is a historic day," Breton said, referring to the signing. With some 5.8 million reported Covid-19 cases and around 149,000 deaths among its nearly 1.3 billion people, Africa is the world's least-affected continent after Oceania, according to an AFP tally. A third wave of virus infections is currently sweeping the continent, raising fears about the consequences of a lack of vaccines. Vaccination rates remain sluggish, with only about two percent of the African population fully vaccinated. Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization's regional director for Africa, warned on Thursday that cases are doubling every 18 days. "Africa has just marked the continent's most dire pandemic week ever," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/senegal-eu-and-us-sign-deal-for-new-vaccine-production-plant/articleshow/84278984.cms||---

Peter R. de Vries was shot in the head while walking to his car after a Tuesday night television appearance. The attack on de Vries, known for courageous reporting on the Dutch underworld, raised concerns around Europe about journalists' safety and media freedom. His condition has remained “unchanged” since the shooting, according to a statement from his family. A ceremony in de Vries' honor was held Friday afternoon at Amsterdam's Westerkerk church, which welcomed visitors to lights candles and to observe a moment of silence. Some 4,000 white roses were heaped in his honor at the Nationaal Monument nearby, with a sign reading “Attack on Freedom of the Press.” Dutch police said the suspected shooter is a 21-year-old Dutchman, and a 35-year-old Polish man living in the Netherlands is accused of driving the getaway car. They were arrested not long after de Vries was wounded. Heavy security ringed the Amsterdam District Court for Friday's hearing. The court said in a statement that “there are currently sufficient objections and grounds to keep the two men in pre-trial detention.” They were ordered held for another 14 days while the investigation continues. No motive for the attack has been disclosed. “We are running through several scenarios and are working with all our might to find out what the role of the suspects is and who else might be responsible,” said police spokesperson Sarah Tillart. De Vries reported on the country's most infamous crimes, from the 1983 kidnapping of a Heineken heir to his investigation into the 2005 murder of US teenager Natalee Holloway while she was on holiday in the Dutch Caribbean island of Aruba. Most recently, he had been serving as an adviser and confidant to a witness in a major trial of alleged drug kingpin Ridouan Taghi. Taghi and 16 others are on trial over a series of murders, including the 2016 killing of a crime blogger who had reported on Taghi's alleged criminal activities. According to Dutch daily newspaper de Telegraaf, the 21-year-old suspect is the cousin of a member of Taghi's organization who is serving a 13-year prison term for orchestrating a series of assassination attempts against rival gang members. Taghi's lawyer said her client was not involved in the journalist's shooting. “There has been a flood of reports in the media about who is responsible for this terrible event. However, my client Ridouan Taghi has been referenced without any objective substantiation,” lawyer Inez Weski said in a statement Tuesday. Two people linked to the witness de Vries was advising were killed in recent years, the witness’ lawyer and his brother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/dutch-court-keeps-suspects-in-custody-over-reporter-shooting/articleshow/84278990.cms||---

The HAS regulator also advised using mRNA-based Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to slow the spread of the Delta variant as they offered more protection than other shots.  "While the number of new cases and the pressure on the hospital system remain relatively low, the dynamic of the epidemic in France is significant and could quickly lead to a deterioration in the health situation," HAS said in a statement.  The regulator's recommendations come 72 hours before President Emmanuel Macron addresses the nation on the progress of the epidemic and his government's strategy to dampen the impact of what many scientists say is an inevitable fourth wave.  The more contagious Delta variant has led to a sharp upturn in the infection rate this month. The regulator said the government should start thinking about mandatory vaccination of the entire population, in order to be ready to take such a decision if necessary.  HAS also recommended shortening the time period between the first and second vaccination doses and recommended that people over 55 who have received the first shot with the AstraZeneca vaccine get a second dose with an mRNA-based vaccine.  After falling from more than 42,000 per day mid-April to less than 2,000 per day in late June, the seven-day average of new infections has been climbing rapidly again since early July.  On Friday, the health ministry registered 4,580 new infections. In the past six days, the seven-day average number of new infections has increased by more than 50% every day, a rhythm similar to the early phases of earlier waves of the epidemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/french-health-regulator-recommends-compulsory-covid-19-shots-for-health-workers/articleshow/84277541.cms||---

Govindapura police recently booked a landlord for the same offence. Sunny O Innocent and Lisa alias Alice Nanyama Hekram, both from Nigeria, were arrested last week on charges of drug peddling and 55 grams of cocaine worth Rs 4.7 lakh was recovered from them. Police learnt that the duo lived at a rented house in Ramamurthynagar. Govindapura police served a notice on the landlord, seeking information about the duo’s visa and passport details collected while renting out the premises and also the rental agreement entered into with the tenants. The owner failed to provide the agreement or other details. Ramamurthynagar police have issued notice to a landlord who had rented out his house to Bangladesh nationals without collecting their information. Notices issued to 15 landlords“According to the Foreigners Act, landlords or hotels have to collect details of visa and passport while renting out their premises to foreign nationals. Failure to do so is an offence. We have served notices on at least 15 landlords in our division who had rented out their premises to foreigners. We have sought details about documents related to their tenants, especially foreign nationals. We will book those who failed to provide the documents,” said SD Sharanappa, deputy commissioner of police (east). According to police sources, east division police —- Banaswadi, Ramamurthynagar, Hennur and Govindapura — arrested a few foreign nationals for allegedly committing offences, including drug peddling. Many of them had managed to rent houses in the area by offering huge rents to induce landlords. These foreigners had not provided copies of their travel documents to the house owners. Police officers said the action against landlords was the result of the latter ignoring their notice to verify the antecedents of foreigners before renting premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/1-booked-for-renting-house-to-foreigners-sans-travel-papers/articleshow/84279205.cms||---

The four boxes of long lashes seized Tuesday at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport were destined for a local beauty supply store, agency spokesperson Matthew Dyman said in a statement.  They hadn't been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration and weren't labeled with the distributor's name or the manufacturer's name, he said.  That means there's no way to tell whether the eyelashes had been exposed to disease during manufacturing or whether they were stored properly and kept away from insect-infested areas, Dyman told The Times-Picayune / The New Orleans Advocate.  "There's no telling what's on these eyelashes," he said.  False eyelashes can be made of synthetics and are attached using adhesive, and unregulated or dangerous materials could lead to allergic reactions, eye irritation or worse, Dyman said.  No business or individual has been cited, the newspaper reported.  Unlabeled, non-FDA-approved false lashes are often seized in New Orleans but officials said this shipment was "particularly large," WVUE-TV reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/eye-popping-6000-false-lashes-seized-at-new-orleans-airport/articleshow/84279336.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Snack seller struggles to earn after attack by youth||BENGALURU: An attack by a youth allegedly high on drugs changed the life of a single mother who runs a small roadside eatery. While people hesitate to come to the woman’s shop due to her disfigured face, her daughter has been forced to discontinue studies and her son is set to follow suit as they can’t afford the fees. The Covid-induced lockdown has only compounded the family’s woes. In June 2016, A Megala alighted from a bus in Bengaluru, holding the hands of her teenage children Padmanjali and Sanjay and dreaming of a better life in the city. The family had come from Vaniyambadi, Tamil Nadu. Working as a domestic help, the 39-year-old had only one goal — to educate her children. Things looked up for Megala in mid-2019 when she rented a petty shop on Thanisandra Main Road with the money she had saved. She set up a bench on which she cooked and sold bajjis and bondas. Soon, Padmanjali and Sanjay joined college. But the evening of September 30, 2020 turned Megala’s life topsy-turvy. A 26-year-old youth under the influence of drugs barged into her petty shop and robbed a pack of cigarettes. Megala questioned the youth, who kicked a pan with two litres of boiling oil. “The next thing I remember was a splash on my face and excruciating pain, with the oil scalding me all over my body. I screamed and rolled on the floor and within seconds, my facial skin melted on to my palms,” Megala recalled in her small rented house in Amarjyoti Layout on Thanisandra Main Road. Locals rushed her to a nearby hospital from where she was shifted to Victoria Hospital for further treatment, which was supported by Parihar, Family Counselling Centre, Vanitha Sahayavani (women’s helpline) of Bengaluru police. “She spent nearly two months in hospital and doctors performed plastic surgery on her face and neck,” said Sanjay. But Megala still struggles with the wounds that scarred her face and chest. The family had to close the shop soon after the oil attack. Sampigehalli police registered a case and nabbed the suspect, who remains behind bars. Lockdown pangsWith all her savings depleted, an ailing Megala was forced to reopen her shop in April as the owner of building demanded the Rs 4,000 monthly rent that was piling up. Then the Covid lockdown came into effect. “No buses were operational so I couldn’t go to the market and pick up supplies for my trade. We all got fever,” said Megala. She rushed to a relative’s home in Tamil Nadu after horror stories of Covid deaths surfaced and a few people she knew succumbed to the virus. Megala returned to Bengaluru with her children a few weeks ago when infections dipped, in the hope of reopening her shop so that she could pay her kids’ college fees. “But I realised that customers, even regulars, were turned away by my disfigured face. My dream of educating my children is broken,” she said. According to Rani Shetty, head of Parihar, Padmanjali dropped out of her BCA course to ease her mother’s burden and Sanjay is planning to discontinue BCom classes. “They don’t have enough money to pay rent or run the business, mainly due to Megala’s health. The family is contemplating leaving the city,” Shetty added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/snack-seller-struggles-to-earn-after-attack-by-youth/articleshow/84279361.cms||Petlee Peter

A consumer court has ordered them to pay a compensation of Rs 20,000 to the couple, who ended up missing their flight. In early 2015, Hulimavu residents Kailash Narayanan, 37, and his wife Usha Radhakrishnan, 33, decided to take a holiday to Bangkok and approached Bengaluru office of MakeMyTrip, whose representatives recommended they fly via Kolkata to Bangkok. After the couple agreed to the idea, tickets were booked for the evening of January 24, 2015 on an IndiGo flight to Kolkata, and from there a connecting flight was booked to Thailand. But much to the couple’s chagrin, on the morning of the trip date, Kailash happened to notice online that the flight from Bengaluru was advanced by a few hours and no information was conveyed to them though they had provided their contact number at the time of ticket booking. The Bengalureans rushed to the city airport in a desperate attempt to catch the advanced IndiGo flight but missed it. Despite urging the ground staff, they were only given an alternative flight on January 26, 2015 and were forced to remain at the airport for a longer period. The couple reached Bangkok two days later and missed out on some sightseeing and hotel bookings. They returned home and contacted MakeMyTrip only to be told the airline had tried to reach their contact number to inform them about the change, but their phone was switched off. With no positive response from the travel portal or IndiGo, the couple approached the Bangalore IVth additional district consumer disputes redressal commission in Shantinagar on September 16, 2016 with a complaint against MakeMyTrip India Pvt Ltd and IndiGo. The couple’s lawyer presented their case, while the portal’s lawyer stated that the cellphone number provided by the customer was switched off when they made multiple attempts to inform the couple about the flight time change. IndiGo’s attorney also maintained the passengers were inaccessible, but added an email about the change was sent to MakeMyTrip which had booked the tickets. In a litigation lasting four years and nine months, judges of the forum came down heavily on the portal and airline. They noted that despite the airline informing the firm about the change, MakeMyTrip didn’t bother to alert the passengers. Meanwhile, IndiGo claimed tickets on an alternative flight were provided to the couple free of cost, but failed to convince the court about the reason for advancing the flight, which caused severe inconvenience to the Bengaluru flyers.

K Jaiprakash, managing director of Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Limited, said the government had taken precautions to maintain strength of the dam and that recent inspections carried out by the dam safety review panel revealed no such concerns. “As recommended by DSRP, we are carrying out a project to further strengthen the reservoir under phase I of the dam rehabilitation and improvement programme. During the course of the work, we took additional precautions. There are no structural defects in the dam construction,” said the statement. CNNL said during the dam-improvement programme, which has been funded by World Bank, a consultant was hired who had recommended changing the reservoir’s 136 gates. “Even during this inspection, no structural defects were identified in the dam walls,” added CNNL. Sumalatha accuses HDK The war of words between Sumalatha and former CM HD Kumaraswamy continued on Friday as the actor accused the JD(S) leader of humiliating cine actors when they requested him to build a memorial for her late husband Ambareesh. Sumalatha alleged actors Doddanna and Shivaram were humiliated as Kumaraswamy flung the requisition letter on their faces. Sumalatha also hit out at Mysuru-Kodagu MP Pratap Simha. “Is he the MP of Mysuru or Mandya,” she asked a day after Simha claimed there were no cracks in KRS dam. Simha responded: “I did not speak favouring any person. Being an MP from Mysuru-Kodagu, I am concerned because KRS reservoir receives water from Kodagu catchment areas. So, I clarified it had no cracks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/day-after-probe-demand-govt-says-no-cracks-in-krs-dam/articleshow/84279412.cms||---

High court chief justice Abhay Shrineewas Oka will administer oath of office and secrecy to Gehlot, 73. Gehlot, who held the portfolio of social justice and empowerment at the Centre, and was leader of House in Rajya Sabha, replaces Vajubhai R Vala, who has been governor of the state since 2014. Though 83-year-old Vala’s five-year term ended in August 2019, he had continued in the post as his successor was not named by the Centre. The President announced Gehlot’s appointment as the new governor on July 6. Born on May 18, 1948 in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, Gehlot graduated from Vikram University. He entered politics in 1962 through Jan Sangh and held several positions in BJP, including its parliamentary board and Central Election Committee. A Dalit leader, he’s familiar with Karnataka as he served as state in-charge between 2006 and 2014 when he was party general secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gehlot-to-be-sworn-in-as-guv-tomorrow/articleshow/84279474.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Alert in districts to check Zika spread||BENGALURU: The health department has directed all districts to put in place vector-management plans to prevent outbreak of Zika virus cases which have been reported in neighbouring Kerala. In his order on Saturday, health and family welfare commissioner KV Thrilok Chandra asked all district administrations to ensure ASHA workers and health assistance monitor regularly in rural areas and fortnightly in urban wards. The department asked officials of Chamarajanagar, Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts in particular to be more vigilant. Monsoon tends to facilitate the spread of Aedes mosquito, which is a vector for Zika virus. Solid waste needs to be effectively disposed of to prevent its breeding. Vector-borne disease control officers of all 31 districts need to step up mid-term strategies, the circular said. Vigil should be stepped up in public places like airports, ports and harbours. The travel history of visitors and even guests at home need to be checked and their samples taken, if needed. They must be sent to National Institute of Virology, Bengaluru, the circular added. The department directed officials to ensure availability of adulticide and larvicide, used for killing mosquitoes, and hold regular intersectoral meetings to help in exchange of information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-issues-zika-alert/articleshow/84279473.cms||---

Forum for Peoples’ Collective Efforts (FPCE), an umbrella body of homebuyers, on Friday wrote to CM BS Yediyurappa, and principal secretary, housing department, Manoj Kumar Meena, on completion of four years of RERA enforcement in the state. It was notified on July 10, 2017. RERA was passed by Parliament in March 2016 to regulate and promote realty in an efficient manner. All provisions of the law came into force from May 2017. FPCE general secretary MS Shankar said in the letter: “Failures and shortcomings of RERA have outweighed benefits derived from it by a wide margin. The authorities have failed in their prime objectives/responsibilities to enforce RERA as per its true intent and protect interests of homebuyers.” Shankar said there is lack of transparency on the Karnataka RERA webpage regarding project-wise details of registered projects and those whose registrations have been rejected, withdrawn or expired. “Non-availability of such data amounts to the officials concerned providing an opportunity to unscrupulous promoters/builders to lead the real estate industry back to pre-RERA status by luring buyers to invest in projects that were rejected or withdrawn and registered projects that had expired,” he said. Shankar added detailed data related to complaints and judgments is not available for the public. “We can only hope the government will wake up from its slumber and take appropriate steps to ensure RERA becomes more effective and meets the expectations of homebuyers, by immediately reviewing functioning of Karnataka RERA and initiating corrective actions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/homebuyers-highlight-rera-failures-ask-govt-to-make-law-more-effective/articleshow/84279497.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Suburban rail runs into depot hurdle, may have to identify fresh land parcels; Huskur land may be chosen||BENGALURU: New locations may have to be identified for setting up rail depots amid reports that the government is going slow on taking up two suburban lines along which they were originally planned. This will impact movement of trains on the two other proposed suburban rail corridors to be taken up in the first phase: Heelalige-Rajankunte (Kanaka) and Byappanahalli-Chikkabanavara (Mallige). The government is said to have stalled two of the proposed four corridors — KSR Bengaluru City-Devanahalli corridor (Sampige) and Kengeri—Whitefield (Parijaata) which run parallel to Namma Metro — fearing that they may affect Metro ridership. According to the detailed project report (DPR) prepared by RITES, two depots were planned — at Jnanabharathi (56.9 acres) on Parijaata line and Devanahalli (61.2 acres) on Sampige line. Depots are crucial for parking and maintenance of trains. According to the DPR, 48 stabling lines, four inspection lines and three workshop lines were planned at Jnanabharathi depot. At Devanahalli, 29 stabling lines, six inspection lines and three workshop lines were proposed. “We’ll have to identify alternative lands for depots since Devanahalli and Jnanabharathi are not part of the first phase of the suburban rail project. Identifying such a huge parcel of land in and around Bengaluru will be a challenge,” said an official. Bangalore University said it will give its land parcel at Jnanabharathi in case the government asks for it. But vice-chancellor KR Venugopal said the university has not yet got any proposal from the government. Additional chief secretary (infrastructure development department) Kapil Mohan said: “We’re making arrangements for depot land. Some land has been identified near Devanahalli and more is being earmarked.” He said the suburban rail system will have broad-gauge tracks so they could temporarily use the existing depots of Indian Railways. “We’ve not scrapped the Sampige and Parijaata lines. All four corridors will be ready in six years. The delay in constructing depots won’t affect the project.” Amit Garg, managing director, Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises (K-RIDE), said: “We’ll soon approach Bangalore University for the required land. In places like Huskur near Electronics City, the railways have land parcels and we’re assessing them to set up depots. Also, some trains could be parked at terminal stations.” Greens’ objectionOfficials feel acquiring BU land at Jnanabharathi won’t be easy as environmentalists may oppose it. Greens had objected to several moves by the university earlier to hand over land for other projects, citing that the campus hosts a biodiversity park, started in 2002, housing over 3 lakh trees, 600 species of flora and fauna in 15 patches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/suburban-rail-runs-into-depot-hurdle/articleshow/84279498.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

---||India||Think of railways as your family, new mantri Ashwani Vaishnaw tells staff||NEW DELHI: For some personnel in the Rail Bhawan, it was a pleasant surprise on Friday when new railway minister Ashwani Vaishnaw visited a few rooms in the railway headquarters to see the working condition. He urged all the staff to think like a family and work together to feel the “satisfaction of doing something”. One small video clip of his visit to a room on the first floor of Rail Bhawan surfaced on Friday evening in which the minister was heard saying, “..Apna ghar hai yeh. Bahut badhiya se kaam karenge, khub maza aayega. Jindagi mein lage ki maza aya. (treat the railways like your family. We will put on a good show and will enjoy it. Let’s get the satisfaction of doing something)” When he was informed that there was staff in the room, who had passed from the same college where Vaishnaw studied, the minister hugged him and said, “In our college, juniors greet a senior as boss”. The employees were seen clapping. The minister also urged the staff to maintain Covid-19 protocol. On Thursday, the minister’s office had issued an internal circular for the staff in the MR Cell (Railway minister cell) for deployment of the personnel in two shifts – one from 7 am to 4 pm and the other from 3 pm to midnight. “We have started implementing this from Friday itself,” said an official. Sources said the minister told representatives from the employees’ federations that they should “accept him as their family member” and that they have the common goal to do their best for the organization. The minister said his focus would be to take the benefits of railways to the poor and vulnerable people and that can be achieved when everyone works together. Officials said the minister chaired two marathon meetings in the past two days – one on the station redevelopment and another on the working of railways where all members made detailed presentations. The ministry has set the target for commencing the work of redevelopment for 123 stations on public private partnership (PPP) mode by 2024. It has also set the target to complete the bidding process for private passenger trains by private players during this year, production of 32 Vande Bharat trainsets by 2024.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vaishnaw-invokes-rail-parivar-after-taking-charge-of-railway-ministry/articleshow/84279321.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||World||US stops jailing pregnant migrants, reversing Trump policy||WASHINGTON: US immigration authorities will no longer routinely jail migrants facing deportation if they are pregnant or recently gave birth, reversing a Trump-era immigration policy. The new directive, announced Friday, does not bar Immigration and Customs Enforcement from initiating proceedings to deport women who are pregnant, nursing or have given birth within the past year. But they generally would no longer be detained pending the outcome of their cases except under “exceptional circumstances," the agency said. The practice of detaining pregnant migrants has been condemned as a threat to maternal and fetal health by immigrant and women's advocacy groups critical of medical care at detention centers. “This reflects our commitment to treat all individuals with respect and dignity while still enforcing our nation's laws,” acting ICE Director Tae Johnson said. The change is part of a broader effort by the Biden administration to roll back Trump-era enforcement measures and return to policies resembling those in place under President Barack Obama. ICE recently adopted draft guidelines to focus apprehensions on people in the United States illegally who recently entered the country, pose a national security threat or have committed serious crimes. While these efforts have angered immigration opponents, the number of people in immigration custody has risen sharply in recent months. There are more than 27,000 people in ICE custody, up from less than 14,000 at the end of March, according to data compiled by the Transactional Research Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. Nearly 80% of those in ICE custody have no criminal record, and a majority of those who do have committed largely minor offenses, according to TRAC. Advocates praised Friday's announcement, but said it doesn't go far enough. The American Civil Liberties Union called on the government to stop detaining anyone who might be at risk in detention. “This action by the Biden administration is a welcome step in the right direction,” said Eunice Cho, a senior staff attorney with the organization. Under Obama, ICE adopted a policy in August 2016 that pregnant migrants would be presumed eligible for release as their cases made their way through immigration courts. President Donald Trump ended that policy of presumed release, part of his administration's heightened immigration enforcement, including arrests of anyone without legal residency regardless of whether they had committed some other offense. The number of pregnant women detained by ICE increased from 1,380 in 2016 to 2,098, according to the Government Accountability Office. ICE is required by law to detain some migrants, including foreign nationals who have been convicted of certain crimes or terrorist activity. The agency pledged that the “very limited” number of pregnant women detained under the new policy would receive regular health care as needed and officials would be prohibited from using restraints on them except in “extraordinary circumstances.” Any child born in the US would automatically have American citizenship.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-stops-jailing-pregnant-migrants-reversing-trump-policy/articleshow/84279582.cms||---

It’s being played in Qatar, and never before has a World Cup been played so close to home. In 2002 when it was Asia’s turn to host the biggest sporting spectacle for the first time, Indians made their presence felt in Japan and South Korea. But 2022 could attract even more. It’s after all being played closest to home. Qatar will also host the most compact version of the tournament with all eight stadiums being within 50km of central Doha, the country’s capital. “The compact nature is probably the most positive aspect of this World Cup. For fans, they won’t have to follow their team from city to city,” said Nasser Al Khater, CEO of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. The World Cup in Qatar is now 500 days away. The 22nd edition kicks off on November 21, 2022, when Qatar make their debut at the Al Bayt Stadium. The hosts are playing at such a big stage for the first time, but they won the Asian Cup in 2019 and remained unbeaten in the qualifiers. According to a statement from the organisers, the infrastructure projects have reached 95 percent completion, with all stadiums expected to be ready by the end of the year. “All stadiums will be ready by the end of the year, which gives us a whole year to test them before the event,” said Yasir Al Jamal, vice chairman of the technical delivery office. “Five of our stadiums have been completed, while the other three will be ready soon. Six of the stadiums will be used for the Fifa Arab Cup 2021 in November and December.” In 2010, Qatar beat competition from United States, Australia, South Korea and Japan to become the first Middle Eastern hosts of the World Cup.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/all-stadiums-for-world-cup-2022-will-be-ready-by-end-of-the-year/articleshow/84280574.cms||---

He is survived by his wife and two sons. “We played together at Salgaocar,” said Bruno Coutinho, SAG director of coaching. “He was a good player and proved to be a good coach too. It is sad to lose someone like him, all of a sudden.” Hailing from Sao Jose de Areal, the talented winger donned the colours of Salcete FC and Sesa Goa before playing for Salgaocar SC in the early nineties for four years. He was known for his ability with the left-foot as he made daunting runs down the flank and swung in crosses to perfection. After giving up professional football, Inacio played inter-village football for Sao Jose de Areal and was active in veterans tournaments for many years. He was initially absorbed in SAG on contract basis and then regularised in 2007. “Inacio was a good dribbler and supplier of the ball. As a coach he groomed many youngsters,” said Arnaldo Costa, general secretary of Curtorim Gymkhana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sag-football-coach-inacio-no-more/articleshow/84280752.cms||---
---||World||South Sudan leader pledges peace on independence anniversary||JUBA: South Sudan's President Salva Kiir made a pledge for peace on Friday as the country marked 10 troubled years of independence, with little cause to rejoice in the face of chronic instability and a deep hunger crisis. At midnight on July 9th, 2011, raucous celebrations erupted as the world's youngest nation was born and the people of South Sudan cheered the end of a decades-long struggle for statehood from Sudan. But the revelry was short-lived. Just two years later South Sudan was at war with itself, the task of nation-building forgotten as its liberators tore the country apart, dashing expectations of a glittering future. Close to 400,000 people died and four million displaced before a ceasefire was declared in 2018. Today the country is more fragile than ever, beset by looming starvation, political insecurity, economic ruin and natural calamities. “I assure you that I will not return you back to war again. Let us work altogether to recover the lost decade and put our country back to the path of development in this new decade,” Kiir said in a televised address marking the milestone. He hailed a “new spirit of dialogue” among political rivals and said the Transitional Government of National Unity would focus on economic reforms and improving security. But on Friday, there was none of the jubilation that greeted statehood, save for a fun run through the capital that attracted some 10,000 people and was cheered by Kiir's nemesis and now vice president Riek Machar. Kiir had warned this week that the cash-strapped state was in no position to celebrate, blaming international sanctions for keeping prosperity out of reach. South Sudan is reeling from economic chaos, with soaring inflation and a currency crisis, and faces its worst hunger crisis since independence. Conflict, drought, floods and a record locust plague have ruined harvests and left 60 percent of the population including millions of children facing severe food shortages. Of those, 108,000 are on the very edge of famine, the World Food Programme (WFP) says. The South Sudan Council of Churches described the past 10 years as “a wasted decade”, a byproduct of self-sabotage. “It must not be another lost decade! It is an opportunity to rescue our people from imposed destitution and sustain their livelihoods,” it said in a statement. The international community appealed to the oil-rich country's once warring leaders to fulfill their promise to the 12 million populations. “The journey from war to peace has been a long and difficult one and there is still much to be done so that people can exercise the democratic right they earned a decade ago,” Nicholas Haysom, the head of the UN mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), said in a statement. Pope Francis and Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby issued a similar message, saying the people of South Sudan continued to live in fear and uncertainty. South Sudan still faces many obstacles to achieving peace and prosperity. These include the lack of a unified security force, pervasive insecurity linked to inter-communal conflict and crime driven by poverty. South Sudan enjoyed immense international goodwill and billions of dollars in support when its people voted overwhelmingly in a 2011 referendum to secede from the north. But its leaders failed to stem corruption and the new South Sudan was looted rather than rebuilt, as huge sums from its vast oil fields were siphoned off and squandered. The political leaders, who led South Sudan to independence and then back to war, are still in power today, ruling in a tenuous coalition forged under a peace deal. The power-sharing arrangement between Kiir, a former military commander from the Dinka ethnic group, and Machar, a rebel leader from the Nuer people, has kept fighting between their forces largely at bay since the ceasefire in 2018. Fighting however continues in ungoverned areas. But the old foes have violated past truces and progress on the latest accord has drifted, inflaming distrust between the pair and raising fears of a return to fighting. The “unity” government they belatedly formed in February 2020 under great international pressure is weak, and safeguards to prevent another war have not been put in place. “Despite some lost opportunities, it is never too late to invigorate the peace process so that humanitarian assistance is more effective, and conditions are created where development activities can have broader and greater impact,” said Matthew Hollingworth, the WFP's director for South Sudan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/south-sudan-leader-pledges-peace-on-independence-anniversary/articleshow/84280737.cms||---

---||India||WhatsApp blinks, says privacy policy on hold…||NEW DELHI: In a climbdown, Facebook-owned messaging platform WhatsApp said on Friday it has voluntarily decided not to enforce its new privacy policy till India’s Personal Data Protection Bill is passed. It made the submission before the Delhi high court, clarifying it would not compel users to opt for its new policy and would implement it only “if Parliament allows” the Bill. Appearing for the company, senior advocate Harish Salve told a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh it won’t limit the functionality for users who don’t opt for the new privacy policy. However, the users would continue to receive notifications to update their policy, Salve said. Taking note of the platform’s stand, the bench pointed out that even though the implementation of the policy has been put on hold, it still continues to exist. “You are not implementing it, but the policy is with you and it can come (into force) any day,” it noted. Salve iterated the latest stand would be maintained till the data protection bill becomes a law. “We have said we won’t enforce it till the bill comes out. If Parliament allows it, we will do it. Commitment is that: I will do nothing till the law comes in. If it doesn’t, bad luck...I’ve taken it off till the law comes into effect. Either we fit in or we don’t”. The Bill seeks to regulate the use of individual’s data by the government and private companies. The development came when the HC was hearing a challenge by Facebook and WhatsApp against the Competition Commission of India’s order directing a probe into WhatsApp’s new privacy policy. Last month, an application was moved by WhatsApp for an interim stay on the probe but the court declined. Salve argued that since the genesis of the probe — the privacy policy — has been stalled for now, the inquiry into the same by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) is now academic. “The objection was to the ‘take it or leave it’ but at present it is something we are not doing. Opt in, opt out is not there,” the senior lawyer underlined, urging the HC to give his client time till the end of July to respond to the questionnaire sent by the CCI in relation to the inquiry. Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Facebook, objected to the CCI probe, saying the commission was jumping the gun by initiating a probe into the privacy policy when a challenge to the same was pending before Supreme Court and the high court. However, additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi, appearing for CCI, said as long as the privacy policy existed, its implications would continue to persist and pointed out that the matter before CCI was only at the stage of inquiry. The CCI had earlier told the court that the issue is not of privacy but access to data and the commission wants to deal with what kind of metadata is shared. After hearing all the sides, the HC adjourned the matter till July 30 by when CCI’s stand would be on record. A single judge on April 22 had said that he saw no merit in the petitions of Facebook and WhatsApp to interdict the investigation directed by the CCI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/whatsapp-blinks-says-privacy-policy-on-hold/articleshow/84281310.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||India||Kerala HC shields newscasters from coercive action under IT rules||KOCHI: In a setback for the Centre, the Kerala High Court on Friday restrained the Union government from taking any coercive action against members of the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) under its new IT rules. Justice PB Suresh Kumar issued the stay, along with a notice to the Centre on the NBA’s plea challenging the new IT rules on the ground that they grant excessive powers to the government to unreasonably and impermissibly restrict freedom of speech and expression of the media. The NBA is a consortium of 78 private television news and current affairs broadcasters, including the country’s leading 25 channels. During the admission hearing, senior advocate Maninder Singh submitted that the high court had passed an order restraining the government from taking coercive action under the new IT rules on a plea filed by the online legal news portal, LiveLaw. Following the submission, the court ordered that no coercive action should be taken against the NBA for not complying with the new IT rules in view of the order passed in the LiveLaw case. In the petition, the NBA contended that the new rules provided in the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 are ultra vires to the Information Technology Act, 2000. It also stated that the new rules violate constitutional rights such as right to equality before law (Article 14) and right to freedom to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade, or business (Article 19(1)(g). The NBA also said in its petition that it is challenging Part III of the new IT rules, titled ‘Code of Ethics and Procedure and Safeguards in relation to Digital Media, as they create “an oversight mechanism giving the executive unfettered, unbridled, and excessive powers to regulate the content of digital news media”. An NBA statement on the litigation said, “The grievance redressal mechanism created, and the powers delegated, have a ‘chilling effect’ on the content of the media. The writ also states that the executive, by creating such a structure, has made inroads into judicial power and vested itself with powers reserved exclusively for the judiciary and such exercise of power is without jurisdiction.” It has been contended by the NBA in the petition that the new IT rules is ultra vires with the IT Act as the Act does not contain any provision for dealing with the content of any programme. “The rules violate Article 14 as there is neither any parity nor any valid exercise of classification in the rules as ‘intermediaries’ have been equated with ‘digital news media’,” the petition said. ‘Programme Code’ has been made applicable to digital news media through the new IT rules. The ‘Programme Code’ contains vague, imprecise, and ambiguous terms in relation to content such as ‘good taste’ and ‘snobbish attitude’. Therefore, the ‘Programme Code’ is not in consonance with the Supreme Court’s ruling on the issue, the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-hc-shields-newscasters-from-coercive-action-under-it-rules/articleshow/84282321.cms||---

The shooting occurred about 9:40 am in the West Garfield Park neighborhood as members of a fugitive task force were trying to serve an arrest warrant for aggravated criminal sexual assault with a firearm, Chicago police Superintendent David O. Brown told reporters.  A group of law enforcement officers identified the man, but he wouldn't get out of the vehicle he was in and pointed a gun at the officers, Brown said.  Three Chicago police officers and a US marshal opened fire. It wasn't immediately clear if the man fired any shots.  Police spokesman Tom Ahern told the Chicago Tribune that the man was taken to Mount Sinai Medical Center in "grave condition" and later died.  No officers were wounded, but the four who fired shots were taken to a hospital for evaluation, Brown said.  The shooting follows a drive-by shooting Wednesday of two federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents and a Chicago task force officer. Eugene McClaurin, 28, of Chicago, was charged Thursday in the shooting of one of the agents.  Authorities said he claimed to have mistaken the officers for rival gang members.  The agents and officers were treated at hospitals and later released.  "It's a very dangerous time to be in law enforcement," Brown said Friday. "These officers face death day in and day out to protect the people of Chicago. There is no regard for law enforcement's presence."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/chicago-police-fatally-shoot-man-while-trying-to-arrest-him/articleshow/84282054.cms||---

The Diocese of La Crosse said in a statement Friday that Bishop William Patrick Callahan has issued a decree immediately removing the Rev. James Altman as pastor of St. James the Less, a parish in the city of La Crosse on the Wisconsin-Minnesota border, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) southeast of Minneapolis. The decree will remain in effect for an undetermined length of time, the statement said.  "(The bishop) and his diocesan representatives have spent over a year, prayerfully and fraternally, working toward a resolution related to ongoing public and ecclesial concerns of the ministry of Fr. James Altman," the statement said. "The obligation of a Bishop is to ensure that all who serve the faithful are able to do so while unifying and building the Body of Christ."  Diocese officials didn't release the decree and didn't immediately respond to a request for a copy.  Altman told conservative news outlet LifeSiteNews.com that he's not surprised the Catholic hierarchy is trying to silence him.  "Unfortunately for the corrupt hierarchy, I will not be silenced by any arbitrary Decree, nor will I be cowed by any action against my priestly faculties," he said.  Altman didn't elaborate. He didn't respond to an Associated Press email seeking comment Friday morning. His parish's voicemail wouldn't accept messages for Altman or the parish secretary.  Altman rose to prominence ahead of the 2020 presidential election with a fiery YouTube video in which he said Catholics can't be Democrats and that anyone who supports Democrats will burn in hell.  He also has sharply criticized COVID-19 vaccination efforts and pandemic-related restrictions on church gatherings as "Nazi-esque controls." His orthodox approach to Mass and sermons has driven some parish members to leave St. James but has galvanized others.  Callahan asked him to resign in May. Altman announced Callahan's request to his parishioners during Mass, drawing audible "Nos" from the crowd, a YouTube video of the ceremony shows.  Altman refused to step down, saying the Catholic hierarchy wants him gone because he speaks the truth and calling U.S. bishops "cowards" and a "brood of vipers" in online videos. Supporters across the United States responded swiftly, raising more than $700,000 through Christian crowdfunding sites for his defense in June.  Altman can appeal Callahan's decree to the Vatican's Congregation for the Clergy, which can uphold or change Callahan's decision. A further Vatican review is possible if the priest disagrees with the Congregation's decision.  Requests that a priest resign aren't uncommon but they rarely lead to such a high-profile refusal, Catholic observers say.  One of the few such cases in the U.S. came in 2002, when a priest in the Archdiocese of Boston refused to step down over an accusation that he sexually abused a child three decades earlier. The Rev. D. George Spagnolia took his case to the Vatican but was unable to overturn his suspension. He died in 2008.  More recently, the Rev. Frank Pavone, an anti-abortion activist who heads Priests for Life, appealed to the Vatican over restrictions placed on his ministry in 2011 by his bishop in Amarillo, Texas. Pavone succeeded in getting the restrictions eased, relocated away from Texas and remains active with Priests for Life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/wisconsin-bishop-takes-rare-step-of-removing-defiant-priest/articleshow/84282879.cms||---

The Andhra-born girl knew then that one day she would head out to space, "no matter what". On Sunday (July 11), her rocket-fuelled dreams will come true. Bandla (34) will be "Astronaut 004" on board Virgin Galactic’s space plane VSS Unity, flyingto the edge of space at about three and a half times the speed of sound along with Virgin founder Richard Branson (Astronaut 001) and four others in a fully crewed 90-minute sub-orbital flight. "I feel like I am taking a bit of India up there with me," she told TOI in an exclusive interaction from VG’s Spaceport America in New Mexico on Friday. If all goes as planned, Bandla (34), a Trekkie, will be only the second India-born woman to go to space, after Nasa astronaut Kalpana Chawla who lost her life in the space shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. The first Indian in space was the IAF’s Rakesh Sharma, who retired as a wing commander. Bandla’s flight role is "researcher experience". She is Virgin Galactic’s vice-president of government affairs and research operations. Bandla’s mother is bringing one of her favourite dishes, mutton biryani, to New Mexico before her daughter takes off to over 3 lakh feet above Earth. Her all-time favourite is the Andhra yellow dal dish pappu. When she returns, she plans to ask her mother to make it for her. "That’s my comfort food, hot rice and yellow lentils with some ghee. I, embarrassingly so, still can’t make it like her." Born in Andhra’s Chirala, Bandla’s parents left with her for the US when she was 4. "The love (for space) actually started when I lived in Houston, surrounded by Nasa. I started looking at how people became astronauts and I tried to model my career after them," Bandla said. Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma (retd) was a big influence. "…sometimes you just need to share an identity with someone to kind of reduce mental barriers… (I tell myself) that’s something I could do because someone from my background and my culture has done it as well," Bandla, an MBA who studied aerospace, aeronautical and astronautical engineering in 2011 at Purdue University, said. "I decided I was going to space no matter what. I didn’t know when it was going to happen, but I was pretty sure I would make it there some day. I credit that to my grandparents and my parents who have always encouraged me, pushed me to keep chasing my dream," Bandla, who dreams to make "safely go where no tourist has gone before" possible, said. "I hope I go to space many times and many others go there too," the India-born astronaut said. Besides Branson and her, the others on the spaceflight will be chief astronaut Beth Moses (Astronaut 002) and lead operations engineer Colin Bennett (Astronaut 003). Branson, who turns 72 on July 18, will "evaluate customer spaceflight experience". SS Unity will be flown by pilots Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci. The mothership VSS Eve (named for Branson’s mother), from which VSS Unity will drop when it reaches 50,000 feet, will be piloted by CJ Sturckow and Kelly Latimer. Unity’s rocket engines will then ignite and carry Branson, Bandla and the four others higher than 50 miles (360,890 feet/110,000 metres) at about 4,300 kmph. At the top of the arc, they will experience weightlessness for about four minutes before Unity re-enters the atmosphere and begins to glide back to Earth. Sunday’s space mission appears to be the result of a race between two billionaires — Branson and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — to get out there first. Both own companies that are pushing frontiers to offer space voyages to tourists. The Virgin Group founder will have made his flight nine days before Bezos when he lands on Sunday. Bezos is scheduled to lift off in his space travel company Blue Origin’s New Shepard on July 20, the 52nd anniversary of the first manned moon landing. Branson describes his own spaceflight as not a race but "an incredible, wonderful coincidence that we’re going up in the same month". Asked about Bezos’ July 20 flight, and then spaceflights by Musk’s SpaceX in coming months, Bandla said: "I know this sounds fluffy but I think the more the merrier. It’s actually absolutely incredible that so many companies are providing spaceflight… It’s not a (doing it) first thing for me. We're creating this industry. It’s really going to change the way we look at not only the planet, but what we can achieve in our lifetimes." At present, the about-90-minute commercial VG spaceflight, which will hopefully start next year, costs about $250,000. Virgin Galactic hopes this will fall to about $40,000 over time. Almost 600-700 tickets have been bought by future astro-tourists, a list that reportedly includes Tom Hanks, who starred in "Apollo 13".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bandla-feel-im-taking-a-bit-of-india-up-there/articleshow/84282796.cms||Saurabh Sinha

If confirmed by the Senate, Garcetti, 50, would replace Kenneth Juster, who served as the US Ambassador to India during the Trump administration. Earlier this week, Juster was appointed as distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Read AlsoBiden nominates Los Angeles Mayor Garcetti to be US ambassador to IndiaThe White House on Friday said that US President Joe Biden has nominated Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti to be the US ambassador to India. Eric M Garcetti has been the Mayor of the City of Los Angeles since 2013, following 12 years as a member of the City Council, including six as Council President.“Today, the President announced that I am his nominee to serve as US Ambassador to India. I am honoured to accept his nomination to serve in this role,” Garcetti said in a statement on Friday soon after Biden announced his nomination. Announcing the nomination along with several other ambassadors, the White House said Eric M. Garcetti has been the Mayor of the City of Los Angeles since 2013, following 12 years as a member of the City Council, including six as Council President. Biden also nominated Denise Campbell Bauer as his envoy to Monaco; Peter D. Haas to Bangladesh; and Bernadette M. Meehan as his top diplomat to Chile. “I love Los Angeles and will always be an Angeleno. I want you to know that every day I am your Mayor, I will continue to lead this city like it is my first day on the job, with passion, focus, and determination,” Garcetti said in a statement. “I have committed my life to service –– as an activist, as a teacher, as a naval officer, as a public servant, and if confirmed, next as an ambassador. Part of that commitment means that when your nation calls, you answer that call,” he said. “And should I be confirmed, I'll bring this same energy, commitment, and love for this city to my new role and will forge partnerships and connections that will help Los Angeles," Garcetti said. As Mayor, Garcetti oversees the busiest container port in the Western Hemisphere, the largest municipal utility in the country, and one of the busiest airports in the world. He led the city's successful bid to return the summer Olympic Games to American soil for the first time in three decades. He currently chairs LA Metro, the country's second-busiest transit agency, which is building or extending 15 new transit lines, and shifting to an all-electric fleet. Garcetti co-founded Climate Mayors and led more than 400 US mayors to adopt the Paris Climate agreement. He is the current Chair of C40 Cities – a network of 97 of the world's biggest cities taking bold climate action and has led the organisation's engagement and expansion in India as well as C40's global response to the COVID pandemic through the sharing of best practices and resources. During 12 years as an Intelligence Officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve Component, Garcetti served under the Commander, US Pacific Fleet and the Defence Intelligence Agency, retiring in 2017 as a Lieutenant. A Rhodes Scholar, he studied at Queen's College, Oxford and the London School of Economics and Political Science. Garcetti was selected as an inaugural Asia 21 Fellow of the Asia Society, and taught at Occidental College's Department of Diplomacy and World Affairs, as well as at the University of Southern California's School of International Relations. “He has lived and conducted field work on nationalism, ethnicity, and human rights in Southeast Asia and Northeast Africa. He is the founding Chair of the Latino Alliance of Mayors at the US Conference of Mayors, serves on the Board of National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, and speaks fluent Spanish,” the White House said..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/honoured-to-accept-nomination-to-serve-as-us-ambassador-to-india-la-mayor-garcetti/articleshow/84282903.cms||---

Covid-19 cases have started rising in UK and Russia, where the Euro Cup football tournament has seen thousands of spectators thronging the stadiums. Other countries like Indonesia, South Korea and Bangladesh are also witnessing a surge in cases. Expressing concerns over a video showing hundreds of tourists without masks enjoying at Mussourie’s Kempty Fall, which has been trending on social media this week, an official said: “Is it not an open invitation for Covid-19 virus to infect us?” “It is a serious cause of concern. There is no scope for lowering the guard as it can reverse the gains. Even though the decline in Covid cases is a positive trend, following Covid-appropriate behaviour is crucial to stop another wave,” Niti Aayog member (Health) Dr VK Paul said. “We are only giving an opportunity to the virus to spread by our irresponsible behaviour. It is not yet time that we can freely mingle and mix without Covid precautions,” Paul added. The Centre also urged local authorities and community welfare groups to enforce Covid-appropriate norms to ensure that livelihood, economic activities and common well-being are all taken care of. “Look at the UK. During Euro 2020, there was a sharp rise in the number of infections there. And now again we are seeing that the country is moving towards a distinct peak. Not only UK, a resurgence is also being observed in Russia, Bangladesh, South Korea, Indonesia etc,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-points-to-uk-russia-warns-dont-drop-guard/articleshow/84283131.cms||---
---||World||California forest closed as wildfires burn, heat returns||BECKWOURTH: Flames threatening campgrounds and cabins prompted evacuations and closed off a swath of Northern California forest as the state headed into another weekend of dry, scorching weather and the continuing threat of wildfires.  Hundreds of firefighters aided by aircraft were fighting the Beckwourth Complex, two blazes sparked by lightning that were carving their way through the eastern edge of the million-acre Plumas National Forest in the northern Sierra Nevada near the Nevada state line.  Campgrounds and homes around Frenchman Lake were under evacuation orders Friday and a nearly 200-square-mile (518-square-kilometer) area of the forest was closed because of the danger, fire information officer Pandora Valle said.  After a day and night of explosive growth, the fire covered more than 38 square miles (98 square kilometers) at midmorning Friday, causing containment to drop to 11%.  The flames were burning through pine, fir and chaparral turned bone-dry by low humidity and high temperatures, while ridgetop winds and afternoon gusts of up to 35 mph were "really pushing" the flames at times, Valle said.  The fire was one of several burning in the north, where several other large blazes destroyed dozens of homes in recent days.  In the region between the Oregon border and the northern end of the Central Valley, the big Lava and Tennant fires were significantly contained, and progress was reported at the Salt Fire as containment improved to 45%. The Salt Fire has burned 27 homes and 14 outbuildings north of Redding, which hit 100 degrees (37.7 Celsius) before 11 a.m. The Lava Fire destroyed 20 structures, including 13 homes, and damaged two structures. The Tennant Fire destroyed five buildings, including two homes.  In north-central Arizona, increased humidity slowed a big wildfire that posed a threat to the rural community of Crown King. The 24.5-square-mile (63.5-square-kilometer) lightning-caused fire in Yavapai County was 29% contained. Recent rains allowed five national forests and state land managers to lift public-access closures.  Climate change is considered a "key driver" of a trend that is creating "longer and more intense dry seasons that increase moisture stress on vegetation and make forests more susceptible to severe wildfire," the agency said recently.  Fire crew officials will be briefing the community on progress Friday evening at the Chiloquin Community Center. The meeting will be streamed on the Facebook page for the Fremont-Winema National Forest beginning at 7 p.m.  In Oregon, pushed by strong winds, a wildfire fire in Klamath County grew from nearly 26 square miles (67 sq. km.) Thursday to nearly 61 square miles (158 sq. km.) on Friday in the Fremont-Winema National Forest and on private land. It was 0% contained, according to the an update posted on Facebook by the incident management team. Klamath County Emergency Management on Friday issued an immediate evacuation order for people in certain areas north of Beatty and near Sprague River.  In Idaho, Gov. Brad Little declared a wildfire emergency in the state Friday and mobilized the Idaho National Guard to help fight fires that had sparked across the state after lightning storms swept across the drought-stricken region.  Fire crews in north-central Idaho were facing extreme fire conditions and gusty winds as they fought two wildfires that threatened homes and forced evacuations in the remote and tiny community of Dixie about 40 miles southeast of Grangeville. Efforts were complicated in part because firefighting resources were stretched thin, fire managers said, and in part because the area has very challenging terrain covered with trees and plants that are dry from the ongoing drought.  The fires near Dixie, covering a combined 19.50 square miles (50.50 square kilometers), were among several that started after lighting storms swept through the region earlier this week.  Meanwhile, forecasters warned that much of California will see dangerously hot weekend weather, with highs in triple digits in the Central Valley, mountains, deserts and other inland areas because of strengthening high pressure over the state. Heat warnings did not include major coastal populations.  Death Valley could reach a staggering 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54 Celsius), the National Weather Service said.  California's power grid operator issued a statewide Flex Alert from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. Friday to avoid disruptions and rolling blackouts. Flex Alerts call for consumers to voluntarily conserve electricity by reducing the use of appliances and keeping the thermostat higher during evening hours when solar energy is diminished or no longer available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/california-forest-closed-as-wildfires-burn-heat-returns/articleshow/84283281.cms||---
---||World||Caitlyn Jenner's 1st news conference short on substance||SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA: Caitlyn Jenner held her first news conference Friday as a Republican candidate for California governor, but it was devoid of any detailed policy discussion 77 days after announcing she was entering a recall election that could remove first-term Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom. Meeting with reporters for just 15 minutes, Jenner asserted she is a serious candidate in the September 14th election and claimed she is leading the field of Republican candidates, even though no independent polling has been done that shows that. “I'm here to win it,” she said. Jenner, who won the Olympic decathlon in 1976 and decades later became a reality TV personality and came out as a transgender woman, said she is better known than any other GOP candidate and even Newsom. The governor has been in office more than two years and earlier served as lieutenant governor and San Francisco mayor. “I have a tremendous advantage, obviously, because of name recognition,” she said. “To be honest with you, I've been in a lot of races in my life, and I know how to win. I just keep working hard.” In her brief appearance before reporters, she suggested building desalination plants to produce more water for the drought-ridden state but provided no specifics about when or where such plants could be built. Jenner also shrugged off polling released last spring that showed she had little public support. However, in referring to the Berkeley IGS Poll issued May 11th, she stated incorrectly that it came out in April and was conducted before she entered the race. The poll was conducted April 29th through May 5th, after Jenner announced her candidacy. Jenner said she would spend the final month of the campaign on a bus tour of the state. She also said she would release her tax returns next week. After an initial burst of publicity when she announced her candidacy on April 23rd, Jenner has faded from the campaign spotlight while other GOP candidates have sought to raise their profiles. They include San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and businessman John Cox, who was defeated by Newsom in 2018. State Assemblyman Kevin Kiley entered the race last week, and conservative radio host Larry Elder is considering a run. The 71-year-old Jenner has anchored her campaign to televised media interviews, which have included embarrassing stumbles that highlighted her inexperience, including recently acknowledging she wasn't deeply versed in Newsom's latest budget. Her candidacy has brought a hostile reaction from some members and groups within the LGBTQ community, which frequently cited her ties to former President Donald Trump. Jenner supported Trump in 2016 but later criticized his administration’s reversal of a directive on transgender people’s access to public school bathrooms. She also split with Trump after he said transgender people would not be allowed to serve in the US military. She said Friday that she doesn't want Trump's endorsement and hadn't spoken to him about the campaign. Meanwhile Friday, attorneys for Newsom were in court seeking a ruling that would allow him to list his Democratic Party affiliation on the recall ballot. He sued the Democratic secretary of state he appointed, Shirley Weber, after Newsom's campaign failed to file the appropriate paperwork to list his party. Those opposing any change include Jenner. Sacramento County Superior Court Judge James Arguelles said he will issue a written ruling Monday after the Democratic officials argued that Newsom merely missed a harmless filing deadline in February 2020 and that it is in voters' best interest to know his party affiliation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/caitlyn-jenners-1st-news-conference-short-on-substance/articleshow/84283289.cms||---

Any such negligence increases the risk of spread of infection, the government said, expressing concern over visuals of crowded places with people not following Covid-appropriate behaviour and social distancing. In a press conference, Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry, said, “The country is still dealing with the second wave and we need to introspect if we can afford the misplaced belief that Covid-19 is over.” Expressing his concern over the sight of crowded places with people not following Covid-19 norms, PM Modi said on Thursday that there should be no space for carelessness or complacency and that a single mistake would have far-reaching impact and may weaken the fight against the pandemic. “Around 80% of the new Covid cases in India are being reported from 90 districts across 15 states and Union Territories, including Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, indicating the need for focussed attention in these areas,” Agarwal said. “53% of the total cases last week primarily have been reported from two states — Maharashtra (21%) and Kerala (32%) — which is a cause of concern,” he said. “We are coordinating with the states to control the spread of infection through intensive containment measures,” he added. He also said 66 districts across 17 states and UTs reported Covid-19 positivity rate of more than 10% in the week ending July 8. Niti Aayog member (Health) V K Paul said the reduction in cases were earlier sharp but now the pace of slowdown has reduced which shows that one should not take the “situation for granted”. “The number of cases being reported now are still one third of what was in the first peak. We have realised it too. The war is not over, the second wave is not over. It is more visible in some districts and two particular states and smaller states in the northeast and so long it is still rising, the nation is not safe,” he said. “We have seen in the past that there is localised predomination in some areas and the situation exploded and this is a warning to us that we should help accelerate this process of decline of this wave effectively to a much lower level to the baseline and the baseline has not been achieved,” he added. Paul further said pregnant women should take Covid-19 vaccines as they are safe.

After a meeting with his counterpart Sergey Lavrov, he said “if people who are tested before travel and tested on arrival, it is a good enough basis for travel”. “But some countries have now introduced the issue of vaccination. So we will have to reach some understanding,” he added. India had earlier requested EU member states to individually consider extending similar exemption to those people who have taken Covid-19 vaccines in India i.e. Covishield and Covaxin, and accept the vaccination certificate issued through the CoWin portal. Jaishankar also thanked Russia for the support and aid when India was battling a deadly second wave in April and May this year. “India has become a partner of Russia in the production and use of the Sputnik V vaccine and we believe that this is not only good for the two of us but it has positive implications for the rest of the world,” Jaishankar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-global-travel-should-be-based-on-tests-not-jabs/articleshow/84283522.cms||---

---||World||Hunter Biden paintings pose ethical challenge for president||WASHINGTON: The White House has established an arrangement that would allow president Joe Biden's son Hunter to sell his artwork for tens of thousands of dollars without knowing the identity of the purchaser, an agreement established in an attempt to avoid any potential ethical concerns surrounding his sales.  Under the arrangement, a private art gallery owner will set prices for his work and will handle all bidding and sales, but will not share any information about buyers or prospective buyers with Hunter or anyone in the administration. The deal was first reported by The Washington Post.  White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday that the gallerist would reject "any offer out of the normal course" and that the administration believes the agreement "provides quite a level of protection and transparency."  "After careful consideration, a system has been established that allows for Hunter Biden to work in his profession within reasonable safeguards," she told reporters. "Of course he has the right to pursue an artistic career, just like any child of a president has the right to pursue a career."  It marks one of the first high-profile tests of the president's commitment to much more stringent ethics rules for his family and administration officials than his predecessor, Donald Trump, who had a daughter and son-in-law working for him in the White House and often spent taxpayer dollars at his own properties. On his first day as president, Biden signed an executive order requiring stricter ethics commitments from all administration personnel, but Hunter's private dealings have drawn scrutiny in the past, with some critics expressing concerns that he sought to profit from the use of his father's name during his lobbying work and work with a Ukrainian energy company.  Hunter Biden has now shifted his focus to the art world. According to an interview in Artnet, Georges Berges, the art dealer that will sell his work, plans to host a private viewing for the president's son in Los Angeles and an exhibition in New York. The paintings cost anywhere from $75,000 for a piece on paper to half a million dollars for large-scale paintings, the dealer said.  That's considerably more than a typical up-and-coming artist without much experience or many sales under his belt, and it's one of the reasons Richard Painter, a White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, says he's uneasy about the arrangement.  "I'm baldly surprised at the pricing," he said. "That's part of the appearance problem."  The concern, he said, is that regardless of who purchases the paintings, such high prices suggest Hunter Biden is profiting off his father's name. Painter worried that foreign governments could fund the purchase through a buyer, or lobbyists could purchase the painting to win favor with those in Biden's orbit, even if Hunter and his father don't know the buyer's identity.  Painter said ideally, Hunter would have waited to sell his paintings until his father left office, to avoid any appearance of impropriety, but since he's turning to this avenue to make a living, the buyers and prices for each painting should be disclosed and recused from any work with the administration.  "I would not have chosen the secrecy route. I would have gone with the transparency route," he said.  The executive order Biden signed reestablished and expanded on many Obama-era ethics rules. It restored a two-year ban on departing senior appointees communicating with their former agency and expanded that ban to include communications with senior White House staff. It also reestablished the Obama-era two-year ban on lobbyists working on the issue they lobbied on within the administration, among other things. He also committed before taking office that none of his family members will work in his administration.  Painter said that while the agreement concerning Hunter Biden's paintings is not ideal, the administration overall has displayed a marked improvement on ethics matters over Biden's predecessor.  "It's minimal compared with Trump," he said. "We definitely have far fewer problems with Biden."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/hunter-biden-paintings-pose-ethical-challenge-for-president/articleshow/84283116.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: Slowdown in decline of cases as some states register spike||Daily cases of Covid-19 in India appeared to be plateauing as Kerala and several states in the northeast continued to register a spike while infections in Maharashtra showed little signs of declining for the fourth week running. India logged 42,718 fresh cases on Friday, a slight decrease from the numbers recorded in the past three days. As compared with the same day last week, when 44,084 new cases were registered, the drop was modest. The plateauing is evident when one compares the cumulative cases this week with corresponding numbers from last week. India has reported 2,09,892 new Covid-19 cases so far this week, just 12,552 less than the numbers in the first five days of last week (2,22,444). That’s a 5.6% dip in cases, significantly lower than the 11.4% drop seen last week. In the week prior to that, Covid cases had fallen by 18.6%. Coronavirus live updatesThe main reason for the slowdown in the decline of the second wave has been a rise in infections in Kerala and a flattening of the numbers in Maharashtra. On Friday, Kerala recorded 13,563 fresh cases, lower than the numbers in the past three days but higher than last Friday’s count of 12,095.

Maharashtra reported 8,992 new cases on Friday. The state has logged 42,822 cases so far this week, around the same as the numbers last week. Infections have been on the rise this week in Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura and Meghalaya.

Former chief of staff Ryan Jackson and former White House liaison Charles Munoz submitted “official timesheets and personnel forms that contained materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements” to mislead EPA personnel and facilitate improper payments over multiple months, according to a report by EPA's Office of Inspector General. The two men, who have since left the EPA, arranged for former agency employees to continue collecting nearly $38,000 salaries even after they were fired, the report says. Separately, Munoz also received an improper raise and submitted “fraudulent timesheets” during periods when he was not at his work station that cost the EPA almost $96,000, the report said. The March 31 report was released this week. In a statement Friday to The Associated Press, Inspector General Sean O'Donnell said, “Continuing to pay fired political staff, creating fraudulent records and authorizing improper pay increases represent serious waste of taxpayer funds.” While the Justice Department has declined to prosecute the former Trump-era officials, “the EPA OIG will do everything within its power to ensure that public officials are held accountable for acts of misconduct during their service,” O'Donnell said. A spokesperson for EPA Administrator Michael Regan said the agency “is evaluating the report and potential next steps.” The 25-page report blacks out the names of the two former employees who received payments after being fired. The Washington Post, citing an earlier version of the report, named the fired employees as Madeline Morris and Kevin Chmielewski. Morris was terminated from her job as a scheduler for former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt in August 2017, while Chmielewski is a former EPA deputy chief of staff who was forced to leave the agency in February 2018, the newspaper said. Federal prosecutors declined to press charges over any of the inspector general's findings. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment Friday. Jackson, a former aide to Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., left the EPA in February 2020 to become vice president for government and political affairs at the National Mining Association. He could not be reached for comment, and a spokesperson for the mining group did not return calls and emails. Munoz, who left the EPA in January when the Biden administration took office, also could not be reached for comment. The report follows years of controversies at the EPA throughout President Donald Trump's term in office. His first EPA administrator, Pruitt, resigned in 2018 following a series of scandals and ethics investigations, including frequent first-class flights, heavy spending on personal security and a sweetheart condo lease connected to a fossil-fuel lobbyist whose firm had sought regulatory rollbacks from EPA. Chmielewski, one of the fired employees, provided detailed information to House and Senate lawmakers about alleged wrongdoing by Pruitt. Chmielewski has filed a lawsuit alleging that Pruitt and other officials violated his free speech and due process rights. The inspector general's report said Jackson, the former chief of staff, met with the scheduler on August 31st, 2017, to tell her “we'll take care of you” by providing “severance pay,” even though he knew severance pay was not allowed. Jackson directed Munoz to tell EPA's human resources division that she was on an extended telework schedule, even though she was no longer working, the report said. Munoz amended her time-and-attendance reports so she could continue being paid. Munoz told investigators Jackson also directed him to provide “severance pay” to the other employee on the condition that he resigns, even though the EPA cannot provide severance packages, the report said. The employee told investigators he refused to resign and was escorted from the building by armed security guards. The inspector general's report also faults Jackson and Munoz for an improper raise for Munoz granted by Jackson when Munoz was transferred to a regional office in Las Vegas. Munoz grew up in Nevada and was the Trump campaign's Nevada state director in 2016. “Pursuant to federal law, regulation and EPA policy, when a federal employee is appointed to a new position at the same grade level without a break in service, an increase in (pay) is not permitted,” the report said, adding, “No justification had been given to support the increase.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/watchdog-2-trump-epa-appointees-defrauded-agency-of-130k/articleshow/84283749.cms||---

A draft regulation for Compulsory Rotating Internship, 2021, released by the National Medical Commission (NMC), mentioned that a week’s training should be included in the rotational schedule in any of the Indian systems of medicine as an elective. In a welcome move, a week’s training each in any two super specialty disciplines, including cardiology, nephrology, pulmonary medicine, and medical oncology, has been included in the internship for MBBS students. Of the 17 postings which MBBS students have to complete over a period of 12 months after graduation, 14 are mandatory and three are electives. The training in super specialty disciplines and Indian systems of medicine are among the electives. For Ayush, the NMC mentioned that interns can choose any elective from ayurveda, yoga, unani, homeopathy and Siddha Sowa Rigpa. Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, said internships are usually done in students’ own specialty. “This will also reduce their time spent in specialties they are expected to be trained in,” she added. A doctor from a civic hospital said: “They should be aware of Ayush, but we hope the training will be on awareness only. There was perhaps no need to include it explicitly in the regulations,” he said. Including super specialty training in internship will give better exposure, said an intern from a government hospital. The NMC has also recommended that students complete their internship from the same institute they graduate from, leaving no scope for transfers. Many seek transfer from private colleges to government ones for better exposure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mbbs-interns-will-have-to-take-ayush-training-says-nmc/articleshow/84283754.cms||Yogita Rao

In a meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow, Jaishankar said that who governs the war-torn country has a "legitimacy aspect" that cannot and should not be ignored. TOI also learnt Friday that Afghanistan's chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation who is responsible for peace talks with the Taliban, Abdullah Abdullah, paid a secret visit to India last week. It was apparently a "personal visit" but still significant as it came at a time Afghanistan is faced with a dangerous security situation because of the US troop withdrawal. Read AlsoAfghans have to rebuild their nation on their own, not US responsibility: BidenWASHINGTON: President Joe Biden on Thursday (local time) made it clear that rebuilding Afghanistan was not the responsibility of the US and urged Afghan leaders to gather together to drive the country towards a better future. President Biden also stated that the US military mission will continueJaishankar's remarks came on a day the Taliban claimed that it now controlled over 85 percent of Afghan territory. While India is reported to have had some contact with the Taliban at the level of security officials, the government has emphatically denied that the foreign minister himself had any engagement with the armed group. The Taliban, buoyed by the US withdrawal, has assured foreign missions in Afghanistan that they won't face any security issue but India remains concerned about ISI's links with Taliban insurgents. Read AlsoTaliban claim to control 85 percent of AfghanistanThe Taliban claimed on Friday to be in control of 85 percent of Afghanistan after seizing key border crossings with Iran and Turkmenistan, part of a sweeping offensive launched as US troops pull out of the war-torn nation."In many cases, where is volatility in society, we leave the people of that country to work it out. But Afghanistan is a different case," Jaishankar said at a joint press conference after the meeting. "For more than 30 years, there have been international conferences, there have been groups and formats to discuss how to stabilize and bring about peace in Afghanistan and the reason is because it has proven implications for regional security and stability. So the point right now we stress is that we must see a reduction in violence. Violence cannot be the solution for the situation in Afghanistan," Jaishankar added. Read AlsoKabul seeks Islamabad's help to persuade Taliban for talksISLAMABAD: Afghanistan has sought Pakistan’s help to persuade the Taliban to hold talks with authorities in Kabul as fierce fighting between Afghan and insurgent forces claim dozens of lives on a daily basis across the country. “We have great expectations from Pakistan. I hope Islamabad willThe government's main concern, as expressed by NSA Ajit Doval during his visit to Kabul earlier this year, remains the possible use of Afghan soil by terror groups based in Pakistan to perpetrate violence against India. The disclosure earlier this year by Afghanistan authorities that the entire Taliban leadership is based in Pakistan and that no decision is being taken by the Taliban negotiators without their advice in the peace process added to the concerns. Afghanistan ambassador to India Farid Mamundzay reiterated concerns over what he called the presence of shuras in Pakistan. "Their families still live there. They have the support and infrastructure currently present in Pakistan, we would want to see that changed," he said. The Afghanistan government had said earlier in a statement that the presence of Taliban leadership posed a serious challenge to the goal of achieving sustainable peace as closure of training camps in Pakistan was vital for peaceful resolution of the Afghanistan situation. "We believe that the immediate need of the day is really a reduction in violence and if we have to see peace within Afghanistan and around Afghanistan, it’s important for India and Russia to work together and ensure that much of the progress that we’ve seen in economic, social and democratic terms are maintained," said Jaishankar after his meeting with Lavrov.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-taliban-sweep-across-afghanistan-india-raises-legitimacy-aspect-with-russia/articleshow/84283816.cms||Sachin Parashar

Justice Pratibha M Singh said a code “common to all” in the country is needed and urged the central government to take necessary steps in this matter. Its observations came while hearing an estranged couple’s plea for divorce where the wife has challenged the application of the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA). Justice Singh said “in modern Indian society, which is gradually becoming homogenous, the traditional barriers of religion, community and caste are slowly dissipating”. The HC said citizens should not be made to struggle due to conflicts and contradictions in various personal laws on the issues of marriage and divorce, highlighting that “courts have been repeatedly confronted with the conflicts that arise in personal laws”. “Persons belonging to various communities, castes and religions, who forge marital bonds, struggle with such conflicts,” it said. The HC noted that the Supreme Court has also repeatedly highlighted the need for such a code, which would enable “uniform principles being applied in respect of aspects such as marriage, divorce, succession, etc., so that settled principles, safeguards and procedures can be laid down”, and referred to the Shah Bano verdict. It said decisions were “rendered way back in 1985 and more than 35 years have passed”. In the Shah Bano case, the SC had said that a common civil code would help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to laws having conflicting ideologies. It had observed that the state was charged with the duty of securing a UCC for citizens. “It is unclear as to what steps have been taken in this regard till date,” the HC said and directed that its order be communicated to the secretary, ministry of law & justice … for necessary action. It was dealing with a plea in which the couple belong to the Meena community, which was excluded from the ambit of the HMA. When the husband sought a divorce, the wife claimed that the HMA did not apply as the Meena community was a notified Scheduled Tribe in Rajasthan. But closer scrutiny by the HC revealed that from the start of the litigation, both parties admitted that their marriage was solemnised according to Hindu rites. The HC said although there was no definition of Hindu the SC has held that if members of tribes are Hinduised, the HMA would be applicable to them, and allowed the husband’s appeal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/take-steps-to-get-a-uniform-civil-code-high-court-urges-centre/articleshow/84283886.cms||Abhinav Garg

Though the proposal has been in the works for more than an year, it has surfaced once again after the recent postponement of organisational polls. A senior leader said that the proposal has been under discussion but it is to be seen if it would fructify in the coming AICC reshuffle. He said the discussion at present was whether to appoint a “vice president” or “working president”. The latter means putting a leader in charge of the party in the absence of a full time president. As reported earlier, the proposal seeks to appoint vice presidents with zonal responsibilities. There is also speculation about the continuation of AICC general secretary in charge of UP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in the same responsibility. The state heads for elections early 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rahul-yet-to-take-over-congress-mulls-more-than-one-vp/articleshow/84283965.cms||---
---||India||Detention law in Telangana ‘draconian’: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court was on Friday surprised to find that grant of bail to an accused had no practical meaning in Telangana as the state police could invoke provisions of Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act to put a person under preventive detention for the same offences for which he had been granted bail by the court. "It is a draconian law clearly against the liberty of persons. It is surprising that no one has challenged the validity of the law," said a bench of Justices R F Nariman, K M Joseph and B R Gavai on a petition by the wife of a detenu. Advocate Gaurav Agrawal told the court that the man, a stock trader, was accused of duping five persons and five FIRs were registered by the Medchal police station under Cyberabad police commissionerate. Agrawal said in all the five cases, the accused was granted bail, but soon after the courts released him on bail, the police put him under preventive detention by moving the designated authority invoking the provisions of Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Boot-leggers, Dacoits, Drug Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders [Land Grabbers, Spurious Seed Offenders, Insecticide Offenders, Fertiliser Offenders, Food Adulteration Offenders, Fake Document Offenders, Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, Gaming Offenders, Sexual Offenders, Explosive Substances Offenders, Arms Offenders, Cyber Crime Offenders and White Collar or Financial Offenders] Act, 1986. The bench issued notice to the Telangana government and sought its response within a week. Agrawal said the powers under preventive detention law should be sparingly used by the authorities only if the danger of commission of a crime is real and proximate as preventive detention is against the constitutional ethos unequivocally supporting life and liberty of persons. Agrawal said all five FIRs accused the petitioner's husband, who is a stock trader, of duping persons of their money in the garb of investment in the stock market. The trial court has examined the gravity of the offences and quality of evidence before granting bail to him in all five FIRs, he said. But, the designated authority in a whimsical manner exercised its powers under Section 3 of the P D Act to put the accused under detention immediately after he was ordered to be released on bail, thus not only violating the right to life and liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution but also in brazen defiance of the well-considered bail orders of the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/detention-law-in-telangana-draconian-supreme-court/articleshow/84284010.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The June 21 notice issued by the Ghaziabad Police asked him to appear before them regarding a probe into the circulation of a communally sensitive video clip of an elderly Muslim man being attacked. After both sides concluded their arguments, Justice G Narendar indicated that he will give his order on Tuesday. On June 24, the court had granted relief to Maheshwari by restraining UP Police from initiating any coercive action against him. It, however, said the police can interrogate him. According to the UP Police, Twitter India’s ‘company master data’ produced by the petitioner shows the premises at Bengaluru is only the place where all books of accounts and papers are maintained and it is neither the registered address nor alternative address of the company. “Thus, the premises can’t be considered an official place of business to give cause of action to the petitioner to file this petition,” the police stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/karnataka-hc-verdict-on-twitter-md-plea-likely-to-be-out-on-tuesday/articleshow/84284118.cms||---

Senior representatives of ministry of earth sciences (MoES) and private weather forecaster Skymet Weather shared with the panel the factors which led to the long ‘break phase’ in monsoon since June 19 and explained how the situation will now improve leading to overall ‘normal’ monsoon in the country as predicted earlier. The parliamentary standing committee on science & technology, and environment, chaired by Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Jairam Ramesh, called them to present their views and share factual position on the status of monsoon, its progress and distribution of rainfall across the country. Ramesh after the meeting tweeted that the standing committee was updated by these officials/representatives on state-wise details on the monsoon situation in the country. “A key concern was capturing the span of rainfall days,” he tweeted. It’s learnt that the MoES told the panel about the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) first and second stage of forecast and why the national weather forecaster stuck to its prediction of overall ‘normal’ monsoon this year. Sources said the panel was told that though the monsoon would reach north-west India almost two weeks after its normal onset date, the pace of its movement would be covered in the next week or so, bringing good rainfall to this region including Punjab, Haryana, remaining parts of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi. Officials of the CSIR also attended the meeting. Representatives of Skymet Weather are learnt to have requested the panel to give private weather forecasters more chance in future to present its views and share experience with the members of the Committee on the monsoon and other weather-related events. As the IMD has already announced end of the ‘break phase’ of the monsoon in other parts of the country, it is expected that the ongoing sowing operation of Kharif (summer sown) crops will pick up in many rain-fed states, ending the acreage gap compared to last year by third week of July. So far, the total sown area in the country is nearly 500 lakh hectares. Though the acreage is about 58 lakh hectares less than the acreage during the corresponding period last year, sowing has already crossed the normal acreage (497 lakh hectares) of corresponding week by three lakh hectares despite low sowing in north-west India due to delayed monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/monsoon-may-cover-nw-india-in-next-24-48-hours-experts-tell-parliament-panel/articleshow/84284150.cms||Vishwa Mohan

The construction work of a new government polytechnic college at Umaria Badal aka Gaida village of Soraon tehsil in the trans-Ganga area of the district has begun. This college will come up in an area of 2.271 hectares. The state government has sanctioned an amount of Rs 6.45 crores for the construction of the college. The instalment of Rs 2 crore has also been released by the government to set the construction work started. The responsibility of constructing the polytechnic has been given to UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam (UPRNN) which is expected to complete the construction work by 2023. The principal of the Government women’s polytechnic college, Teliayarganj Shailendra Pratap has been appointed the project officer. “Construction work has now started with the release of funds by the state government. The executing agency has been given two years to complete the construction,” he added. Pratap said that the new polytechnic college being constructed would have a dedicated administrative block and would be having modern labs embellished with requisite gadgets for the benefit of the students. For better security, the entire sprawling campus would have a boundary wall. For the teachers working in the polytechnic, the campus would also have houses so that faculty members can perform their duties with ease and comfort without spending a long time commuting to and from the college, he said. Prayagraj at present has five government polytechnic colleges including the Institute of Engineering and Rural Technology (IERT), Northern Regional Institute of Printing Technology (NRIPT), Government Girls Polytechnic at Meja, Polytechnic College at Handia and Government Girls Polytechnic, Teliyarganj. These institutions are facing an acute shortage of teachers and are largely dependent on guest faculty members or contractual teachers to teach students. These five technical institutions have a total of 291 sanctioned posts of teachers but only 65 teachers are currently there —a measly 22 per cent of the total sanctioned strength.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/new-polytechnic-coming-up-in-district-a-boon-for-rural-students/articleshow/84278304.cms||---

One Ganesh Chouhan (34) was found dead inside his room in the village. This is the second such incident in Nawada in four months. At least 16 persons, including a teenager, had died due to alleged hooch poisoning in Nawada town after Holi in March this year. Mufassil SHO Lal Bihari Paswan said Rohan Chauhan (35), who was involved in manufacturing countrymade liquor inside his residence, was among the five arrested in the case. “Rohan and four others were produced before the court which forwarded them to jail,” he said. Two family members of Rohan were evading arrest. The SHO said around 5.5 litres of country liquor and several liquor manufacturing equipment were seized from Rohan’s residence. However, he said only further investigation and forensic report would make it clear if Ganesh died after consuming poisonous hooch. “Ganesh’s family alleged that he had consumed liquor at Rohan’s residence Tuesday night. They had to carry him back home and made him sleep inside his room. Next morning, he was found dead. They alleged that Ganesh died from liquor consumption,” the SHO said, quoting the FIR. “No chemicals or medicines were recovered during the raid.

Senior BJP leader Ashish Gupta told TOI on Friday, “At a time when the Yogi-led state government has been opening gaushalas and other projects for the protection of cows, SP has fielded Mohd Muzaffar for the post of block pramukh from Kaurihar block... SP is banking on goons to contest the block pramukh polls and gundagardi (hooliganism) is their identification.” Gupta said rival camps, particularly SP, have lost their cool after seeing a series of development works and projects being carried out by the BJP-led state government. He said, “Samajwadi Party is loosing janadhar (mass base) in UP. The real face of SP has been exposed since it has made a man with vast criminal record, including cases of cow smuggling, as its candidate for block pramukh polls.” However, SP district spokesman Daan Bahadur “Madhur” said cases against the party candidate are “politically motivated”. BJP has been crying foul after sensing its defeat in block pramukh polls, he said. Madhur said, “BJP has been levelling false allegations on party candidate but it’s the court which will only decide if charges are true or not. BJP is only misusing its power.” Puramufti police of Prayagraj district has slapped a case under Gangster Act against Muzaffar and 13 of his close associates on the charges of cow smuggling. Before the police could nab him, he managed to surrender in a local court and was sent behind the bars. A senior cop said over a dozen criminal cases were registered against Muzaffar in different districts of the range, including Prayagraj, Kaushambi and Fatehpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/sp-fields-cow-smuggler-for-block-pramukh-post-bjp-hits-back/articleshow/84278200.cms||---

This is 25 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) higher than the previous one issued in December 2020. The ‘when issued’ segment of the RBI’s bond trading platform too indicated the yield will be set at that level. As the name of the segment suggests, the RBI allows market players to trade bonds that are to be issued in the next few days. The new 10-year bonds started trading in this segment on July 5, the day the government announced it would introduce a new benchmark gilt. Issuance of the new benchmark bond at a higher yield indicates the central bank’s willingness to accept the increased level. During the day, the RBI also announced that all states would together borrow nearly Rs 1.9 lakh crore in the current quarter ending September 30. This is about Rs 20,000 crore more than what was announced earlier. Bond dealers said that this extra amount of borrowing could put extra pressure on yields in the coming months. This, in turn, could also put some upward pressure on yields across the bond market, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-rolls-out-new-10-year-gilt-at-6-1/articleshow/84279027.cms||---

SP district president Yogesh Chandra Yadav alleged, "BJP men have forcibly occupied the certificates of the majority of kshetra panchayat members and these panchayat members are being forced to vote in favour of BJP candidates." He further demanded that the Election Commission (EC) must allow the Aadhaar card as an alternative for kshetra panchayat members for identification for free and fair polls. They said that panchayat members should be allowed to cast their vote after showing their Aadhaar card. Yadav, meanwhile, alleged that the police and local administration at the behest of state government was harassing party candidates, their proposers and supporters forcing them to roll back their nominations on Friday. He also alleged that a team of Soraon police had on Thursday night picked up many party leaders including the husband of the party candidate and brought them to the police station without reason. They were forcibly stopped at the police station throughout the night and released on Friday morning after issuing them challan. Similarly, Shankargarh police have too forced the proposer of the party candidate to stay at the police station throughout the night. SP leaders demanded that adequate police forces should be deployed at Shringverpur block with the claim that the BJP candidate from the same block was an influential person and his presence could impact the voters. Meanwhile, SP candidate Indra Nath Mishra was declared the winner for block pramukh in Kaudhiyara block. Senior police and administrative officials on Friday reviewed the security arrangements at the office of block development offices in 22 blocks. Additional police forces have been deployed to maintain law and order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/sp-workers-accuse-police-administration-of-harassing-party-leaders/articleshow/84278180.cms||---

The Ramna STP is in the eye of a storm, particularly after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath sought a report from the divisional commissioner and asked to fix the accountability of the officials who prepared the sewage estimation report of Asi river (nullah) and detailed project report of Ramna STP. During his recent visit to the city, the CM was informed that the sewage load on Ramna STP is over 60 MLD. Interestingly, the sewage load till 2030 had been estimated as 50 MLD in the DPR. “The work on the Ramna STP is a total wastage of money and time, as it is not only overburdened but also incorrect from the point of view of engineering,” claimed Prof. Vishwambhar Nath Mishra, president of Sankat Mochan Foundation (SMF), an NGO acting as the watchdog of Ganga’s health since the inception of the Ganga Action Plan (GAP) in 1986. “For the first time, we had made an actual measurement of sewage discharge into the Ganga through Nagwa drain in 2010. At that time the sewage discharge was 64 MLD, which would have surely increased up to over 80 MLD in a decade,” Prof. Mishra told TOI. “After CM’s strong stance, authorities concerned would try to rectify the mistake, but it is not an easy task,” he said, adding that the sewage pumping built years ago at Nagwa for the STP is also of 50 MLD capacity. “A pumping station never runs with full capacity, and in such a situation the STP will get less than 50 MLD sewage for treatment,” he added. The sewage pumping station and interception and diversion of Nagwa Nullah, which was started in 2008 with a cost of Rs. 1,450.50 lakh, had been completed during the then chief minister Mayawati. While as per the DPR the STP is being constructed with a capacity of 50 MLD, the general manager of Ganga Pollution Control unit of UP Jal Nigam Fanindra Rai said that the actual average discharge of sewage through Nagwa drain is about 80 MLD. Regional officer of UP Pollution Control Board Kalika Singh too said that the average discharge of sewage through this drain is 80 MLD. They said that the sewage discharged was measured by the flow meter. It is also interesting to note that the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has different figures regarding the sewage discharge through Nagwa drain. According to CPCB’s monitoring report of 2018, the Nagwa drain discharged 198 MLD sewage during pre-monsoon period and 138.93 MLD during post monsoon period. The CPCB in collaboration with State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) in the states and Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) in Union Territories has established a National Water Quality Monitoring Network (NWMP) in order to assess status of water quality and to facilitate for prevention and control of pollution in water bodies. “How the DPR of 50 MLD was prepared, when the CPCB data suggested discharge of 198 MLD and 138.93 MLD sewage during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods respectively,” wondered Prof. Mishra alleging that the same old mistakes of GAP are being repeated time and again without doing groundwork. “The basic problem is that the persons not knowing the basics of river anatomy, morphology and dynamics are great doctors of the river,” said noted river engineer and director of the Mahamana Malviya Institute of Technology for Ganga Management and former professor at IIT-BHU Prof. UK Chowdhary. “Isn’t there a difference between a doctor and a pathologist?,” he said suggesting, “Kindly be a river doctor then solve the problem of the river.” Prof. Chowdhary had also recently written to the CPCB chairman and pointed out the lapses in pollution management of the rivers. “The Assi river was wrongly shifted, which caused the permanent shifting of the Ganga from the Assi ghat. Now, the outlet of the Assi river joins the Ganga at Nagwa at 90 degree and causes the heavy loss of momentum and turbulence of the Ganga and is causing the spread of the pollutants,” he said. He suggested that all river problems should be solved with the help of experts of river institutes/centres. The experts of the Ganga Research Center BHU, the River Research Center, Pune, and Mahamana Malviya Institute of Technology for Ganga Management, Varanasi, he added. Info: # The Ganga Action Plan (GAP) was launched by then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1986 with the main objective was to improve the river water’s quality to acceptable standards by reducing pollution load # Three STPs with a total capacity of 102 MLD for treatment of municipal sewage at Deenapur, Bhagwanpur and Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) in the first phase of GAP # In 2008, the Ganga was declared National River and the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) was formed in 2009 as an empowered planning, implementing and monitoring authority for the holy river # In June 2014, the Narendra Modi government approved the ambitious ‘Namami Gange Programme’, an integrated conservation mission, as ‘flagship programme’ with budget outlay of Rs 20,000 crore to accomplish the objectives of effective abatement of pollution, conservation and rejuvenation of the National River # Two more sewage treatment plants have been established at Deenapur (140 MLD) and Goithaha (120 MLD) and now the sewage treatment capacity of the city is 362 MLD against generation of around 350 MLD sewage||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/experts-raise-doubt-over-efficacy-of-50-mld-ramna-stp/articleshow/84278775.cms||---

The notice, served to Prof J S Singh on July 2, has been signed by the varisty’s registrar Prof N K Shukla (TOI is in possession of the copy of notice). Prof Singh has been given a week’s time to respond to the notice. The notice mentions that, ‘It has come to the notice of the competent authority that you (Prof Singh) had gone to the house of a senior professor, who is neither from faculty of law nor controller of examinations, along with a group of students to pressurise him to expedite the conduction of last semester examinations of faculty of law during odd hours. It is neither desirable nor appropriate to visit the house of an unconcerned faculty member along with students to manage the affairs of your faculty.” It further reads, ‘It is also being reminded that the Vice-Chancellor has given her approval to conduct the last semester examinations of the faculty of law latest by July 15 in online mode. You as dean were supposed to arrange and coordinate such exams with the controller of examinations and complete the task by the given date. But it is apparent that nothing has been done from your end and you got involved in undesirable behaviour affecting the functioning of the university. Therefore, the competent authority has taken a serious note of this behaviour and seeks explanation within a week from you on the above-mentioned events’. This is issued with approval of the VC.” AU public relation officer (PRO) Jaya Kapoor acknowledged that Professor Singh has been issued a show-cause notice and has been given a week’s time to submit his explanation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/au-slaps-show-cause-notice-on-dean-of-law-faculty/articleshow/84278256.cms||---

IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said the operation was launched a week ago after getting information about touts running a network and getting evidence against them through the security staff and the CCTV cameras. “We contacted the city SP on whose direction a Shastri Nagar police team started surveillance by watching the CCTV footages and finally nabbed five persons and seized six mobile phones from them today. Many other touts fled from the campus,” said Mandal. The IGIMS runs three drugstores — Jan Aushadhi Kendra, Amrit and Central Drugstore under the Prime Minister Jan Aushadhi Kendras where medicines are available at 30 to 40% less price than sold in private shops. As some poor patients run short of money to purchase all the prescribed medicines there, the touts offer them to mortgage their personal belongings, mobile phone, gold ring, chain or watches in lieu of arranging medicines from outside and that, too, on higher prices, he said. The second wave of the Covid and the lockdown had put a brake on the touts as all the medicines against the viral infections or mucormycosis were made available from the state government or the institute’s drugstores. Mandal said the drive would continue as dozens of members of the touting gang were still to be nabbed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/5-touts-held-on-igims-campus/articleshow/84275321.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Allahabad||HC seeks DGP’s personal replyin torture of ex-army jawan||Prayagraj: Hearing a plea filed by an ex-soldier of the Indian army alleging humiliation and brutal torture by the Uttar Pradesh Police, the Allahabad high court, after taking into account the injury reports and FIR filed by him, on Thursday observed that “prima facie, it shows a very sorry state of affairs, police atrocities and a breach of fundamental rights of the petitioner by the accused police officials.” Emphasizing that the matter is serious and requires serious consideration of the court, a division bench comprising Justice Surya Prakash Kesarwani and Justice Gautam Chowdhary directed the UP DGP to file a counter-affidavit (reply) by means of his personal affidavit, indicating the action taken in the matter. Hearing a writ petition filed by Resham Singh, an ex-soldier of the Indian army and the victim, the court requested the advocate general of UP to assist this court in the matter and fixed the matter for hearing as a fresh case on July 12 for further hearing. A video of the said incident had gone viral on social media. On May 2, Resham Singh, along with his mother and two sisters was going from Pilibhit to Lakhimpur Kheri when they were stopped by the police officials at around 9 am. The police then asked for the papers of the car in which they were travelling. Allegedly, since it was taking some time to sort out the papers, the police officials abused the victim and his mother and two sisters. The victim asked the police officials to not abuse them and also informed that he was a retired member of the armed forces. This infuriated the police who threatened the victim and his family members that they will teach them a lesson for life. They then started abusing and beating the victim with lathis. Allegedly, the police officials also beat his mother and sisters and took them to the police station without taking the assistance of any woman police officer. At the police station, the victim was disrobed and tied on a cot and brutally beaten up by the said police officials for two continuous hours. They also gave him third degree torture only to satisfy their ego, the petitioner alleged. Thereafter, he lodged an FIR against the erring officials and took treatment in the army hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-seeks-dgps-personal-replyin-torture-of-ex-army-jawan/articleshow/84278213.cms||---

Two persons, including one Suraj Kumar (24) of Delhi, were arrested. It was Suraj who had booked the premium cab via a mobile phone based application at Mahipalpur in Delhi for travelling to Balaji guesthouse in Supaul town for Rs27,000. Suraj, along with three others, looted the car and cellphone from its owner Satpal Singh after reaching Supaul on Wednesday morning. Supaul SP Manoj Kumar said Suraj's friend Mohammad Sarfaraz alias Chotu (22) was also arrested. "The car was found abandoned near a petrol pump under Kishanpur police station area of Supaul on Thursday night," he said. Kumar said raids are on to nab the two others involved in the loot. The SP said the accused had tied Satpal and tried to take him to a secluded place on a bike, but he managed to jump and escape. "Satpal approached the police on Wednesday evening. Town police station SHO Vinod Kumar Singh said the two were arrested on Thursday noon and later the car was recovered. The SHO said Satpal belongs to Auraiya in Uttar Pradesh, but is settled in Delhi and owns several cars to run as taxis. "Suraj's family belongs to Mallik Chowk, Supual, but settled at Patel Nagar in Delhi almost two decades ago. He booked the car with friend Ishtekhar to reach Supaul," he said. The SHO said Ishtekhar got down from the car a few kilometres before the destination and paid Suraj Rs12,000 of his share. "Suraj took Satpal to the guesthouse and told him after several hours that his friend Sarfaraz would pay. Satpal went with Sarfaraz, but instead he was captured, thrashed and threatened not to come to Bihar again before they looted his car and cellphone," Singh said. He said a finance firm agent had got an SMS alert and approached Satpal about his three pending EMIs against the car loan. "The firm's internal software generates pan India alerts. Suraj got to know about this after which his associates posed as loan agents and took away the car. This kept Satpal and police confused for several hours. However, soon after the police quizzed the firm agent, things became clear that the car was looted," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/car-looted-from-a-delhi-man-in-supaul-recovered/articleshow/84276313.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation to chalk out plan for slum development||VISAKHAPATNAM: In a first step towards preparing a slum upgradation action plan, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation has decided to launch a two-day survey to understand the infrastructural matrix in slums. The survey, which would be held on July 11 and July 12, would aggregate data pertaining to slum dwellers, geographical precincts of each slum, access to services, social infrastructure, and key issues and challenges. As per the initial estimates, there are 793 slums in Vizag, including 426 notified and 367 non-notified slums. About six lakh people live in these slums. The civic body conducted an orientation programme for ward secretaries over a two-day survey on Friday. The GVMC has formed 793 teams for the survey. As per the city development plan prepared by the GVMC about a decade ago, the Visakhapatnam slum improvement project, implemented with £9 million grant funding from the DFID, UK during 1988-1996, improved the service provision for about two lakh slum residents in the city. This slum upgrading initiative was evaluated as a successful one within its specified objectives. However, it only worked in ‘notified’ slums of the city. Later, the GVMC took up various initiatives to improve infrastructure and livelihood of slum dwellers under several government schemes. However, the fruits of these initiatives did not reach everyone. It is estimated that a majority of these slums sprang up on GVMC and government lands. Categorisation of some slums as ‘objectionable’ was based on the location and land use such as: on riverbeds, low lying areas, drains, road margins, etc. Slum settlements have multiplied over the decades in the city. But the living conditions of the poor have not improved. GVMC mayor G Hari Venkata Kumari said the state government is determined to make Vizag a slum-free city. “Based on the survey data, the GVMC would identify both notified and non-notified slums and prepare development plans. The non-notified slums would be accorded legal status through a notification. The slum dwellers would be conferred with legal rights over the land. We are planning to distribute pattas through the hands of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy in August,” said Venkata Kumari. GVMC commissioner G Srijana said civic body staff would visit each household in the slums and aggregate data. “The GVMC is conducting the survey to completely change the face of the slums. Local corporators and residential welfare associations and others should cooperate with the staff,” said Srijana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-to-chalk-out-plan-for-slum-development/articleshow/84275596.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The revised syllabus has been posted on the Council website and alerts have been sent to school principals so they can inform teachers to immediately ring in the changes for the 2022 examinations. School heads have called meetings with subject heads on Monday to discuss the changes and how to factor them in. The syllabus of English and Indian languages had been reduced earlier. The changes, posted in the ‘publications’ section of the website, have been done in consultation with subject experts, “without compromising on the quality of the content,” the letter to the principals said. The reductions in ICSE were announced for history, geography, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, economics, commercial studies, computer applications, economic applications, commercial applications, environmental applications, home science, physical education and yoga. In ISC, the reductions have been announced for accounts, commerce, economics, business studies, history, political science, geography, sociology, psychology, computer science, biotechnology and environmental science. “From what I can make out, no major chapters have been cut but sub-topics have been reduced,” said a school principal. “It’s too early to say if this will be the final reduction,” said a history teacher at La Martiniere for Boys. Most schools felt further reductions might come in depending on the pandemic. “The Council has asked us to teach in the same serial order so we are teaching the same topic at the same time,” said a principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cisce-announces-syllabus-slash/articleshow/84278113.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Officials have begun the exercise to identify suitable land to set up another six rythu bazaars. The new markets will come up at Vizianagaram Town, Bobbili, Garividi, Kothavalasa, and Cheepurupalli. Two rythu bazaars are planned—one for Vizianagaram Town and another for Kothavalasa—in the first phase, and another four in the next phase. The number of rythu bazaars has failed to keep up with the expansion of Vizianagaram city in recent years, and at present, the city has three operational rythu bazaars. The variety of fresh fruit and vegetables at these markets draws more customers than other vegetable markets, as well as the sale of essential commodities at reasonable prices. Officials of the horticulture department said Vizianagaram district has been producing high quality vegetables over the past few years and a marketing facility is needed for farmers to sell their produce. Once the revenue department identifies land for the proposed rythu bazaars, the marketing department will speed up the process, officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/six-new-rythu-bazaars-planned-across-vzm-dist/articleshow/84275826.cms||---

---||Business||RBI: Send vital bank staff on 10-day surprise leave||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked banks to ensure that employees working in sensitive positions are asked to go on a surprise leave of at least 10 days every year. This follows a revision to the central bank’s risk management guidelines. Earlier, employees in sensitive positions were required to go on mandatory leave. However, despite the mandatory leave directive, it was noticed that in cases of frauds, employees had managed to cover their tracks before going on leave. The mandatory leave regulations have been in place since April 2015. But in the case of the Nirav Modi fraud, the Punjab National Bank employee concerned managed to make fraudulent entries in the Swift system for years before being apprehended. “Employees posted in sensitive positions or areas of operation shall be compulsorily sent on leave for a few days (not less than 10 working days) in a single spell every year, without giving any prior intimation to these employees, thereby maintaining an element of surprise,” the RBI said. The central bank added that once on leave, the employee should not be granted access to office files or systems. Banks have been asked to decide at their board level which of the positions qualify to be part of the sensitive list. The RBI has been periodically updating its risk management guidelines with the intention of reducing fraud. These including having a ‘maker-checker’ approach and incorporating a policy of staff rotation.

They also seek opportunities for wealth creation in their jobs and want employers to introduce long-term incentives in their benefits such as ESOPs. Over 45% of those surveyed by global consulting firm Grant Thornton in their Human Capital Survey indicated that their total pay (fixed+variable) decreased as a result of Covid, and of these, over 59% experienced a reduction of more than 10% in their total pay. The survey also revealed a clear trend of decrease in the variable pay component with over 31% of employees receiving no variable pay, and 33% facing a dip in their variable pay. Almost 46% of respondents said that there is a need for a higher fixed compensation, even if the total pay reduces with over 84% of employees with a work experience of less than 10 years rooting for such an option. Similarly, a large 73% of employees indicated that there is a need for organisations to introduce long-term incentive plans such as employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), retention bonus, etc. in their compensation structure. The younger workforce (upto 15 years of work experience) are typically looking at building a corpus and making bigger investments, the survey notes. Further, to adapt to the new ways of working, employees also seek certain additional benefits with respondents saying that medical insurance, home office set-up allowance, and work from anywhere model are benefits as important as a good salary package. “The definition of benefits is no longer restricted to medical insurance. While compensation managers will have to factor in all these incentives while designing their compensation philosophy, employers will have to relook at the definition of total compensation, what to include and what not to,” Amit Jaiswal, Partner, Human Capital Consulting, Grant Thornton Bharat, said. Neeraj Sharma, VP of HR at logistics enterprise FourKites says the uncertainty posed by the pandemic has made professionals seek benefits more current in nature, pushing the need to reinvent pay structures and allowances. “For instance, we have repurposed allowances such as conveyance and food into benefits for wellness and professional development through online learning,” he said. Rohit Mathur, head of Ramco’s global payroll and HR solution, which provides AI-powered HR and payroll tools to clients, said the company is witnessing a trend of large corporations providing pay on demand, which allows employees early access to their salary than the scheduled frequency of pay out. Grant Thornton surveyed 16,700 working professionals across various sectors and hierarchies for the survey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/over-45-workforce-saw-pay-reduction-in-pandemic/articleshow/84279009.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The court of Justice Rekha Palli initially wanted to impose a penalty for filing the petition without merit, but spared him on the request of Chirag’s counsel. “I find absolutely no merit in the petition,” the court observed. Hajipur MP Paras, who engineered a split in the LJP with the support of four of the five other party MPs, was made food processing industries minister in the Union cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday. Chirag had challenged the June 14 order of the Lok Sabha Speaker, who had replaced him with Paras as the LJP leader in the House. Chirag pleaded that Paras and the four other MPs had been expelled from the party at the LJP national executive committee meeting, which was attended by 66 of the 77 members. Meanwhile, posters and banners were put up at different places in Patna hailing the induction of Paras into the Union cabinet on July 7. Chirag had told the media that he would move the court if Paras was sworn in as a minister from the LJP quota. The posters with LJP symbol, reportedly released by former LJP leader Keshav Singh (who recently joined the JD(U)) and others, congratulated both PM Narendra Modi and CM Nitish Kumar for inclusion of Paras in the Union council of ministers. Chirag, who reached his father late Ram Vilas Paswan’s home district Khagaria on the third day of his ‘ashirvad yatra’ on Friday, said that he would have been a minister at the Centre, had he compromised and bowed down before CM Nitish Kumar. “But I chose the other way,” he said. Slamming the state government, the Jamui MP said he would fight against corruption, atrocities against members of the scheduled castes and high-handedness of the bureaucracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/delhi-hc-rejects-chirag-paswans-petition/articleshow/84275726.cms||Ramashankar

Currently, although RPs (the court-appointed persons who carry out the resolution process) are required to disclose to the exchanges details about companies under IBC, there have been instances of non-compliance, an NSE release said. Under the new norms, an RP is also required to disclose to the shareholders of the company about the impact of all insolvency court decisions through the bourses. Sebi had amended its Listing Obligation & Disclosure Requirement (LODR) guidelines for disclosures by RPs, which were effective from January 8, 2021. On their part, bourses and brokers will also highlight the stocks of all those companies that are under the IBC process, the NSE release said. In case the insolvency court orders delisting of a company, the exchanges will suspend trading in the stock of that company, the release said. The exchanges will also issue detailed guidelines for disclosures by RPs. The release also noted that the exchange shall identify the security in a way that will be easy for investors to know that it is currently under the resolution process. “The exchange will continue to provide an alert at the time of order entry informing the market participants that the scrip is undergoing (resolution under IBC).” Such alerts will be available from the day of admission into resolution process till the day of its suspension or exit from the resolution process, investors will have precise information about the status of that company, the NSE said. If a resolution plan allows the value of the listed stock to be reset at zero and the company is ordered to be delisted, or “where the entire equity capital is reduced/cancelled/extinguished without any payment to the existing shareholders, exchanges in coordination with each other”, trading in the stock should be suspended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/exchanges-seek-prompt-info-on-cos-facing-ibc/articleshow/84279055.cms||---

Singh, on the other hand, refused to comment on the issue. “I cannot answer all the questions,” Singh was heard telling mediapersons. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan wrote on an instant messaging platform that the rumours regarding Singh’s resignation had no base. “Even Jagdanand Singhji has refuted such rumours,” he wrote. Party’s another spokesperson, Mritunjay Tiwari, accused JD(U) of creating the controversy. “There is a big tussle going on in JD(U). Everyone is aware of it. In order to divert the attention of people from their inner tussle, the party planted this fake news,” Tiwari added. Asked about leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav leaving for Delhi on Friday, Tiwari said, “Tejashwiji’s family is currently living in Delhi. We all know how important it is for a son to look after his ailing father. His visit has nothing to do with politics.” However, a senior RJD functionary said Singh had earlier expressed his desire to resign from the post of state president of the party after the conclusion of assembly election. Meanwhile, BJP national secretary general (OBC wing) Nikhil Anand has described RJD as a party of ‘one family’ where senior leaders are only insulted. “Remember how Ramchandra Purbeji was disrespected and made to step down from the post of state president. Even senior leaders like late Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and Shivanand Tiwari had been dishonoured,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-refutes-rumours-of-jagdanands-resignation/articleshow/84275616.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: No revision of land value this fiscal||AMARAVATI: In a big relief to people, the state government has decided against revising the market values of land during the current fiscal. The stamps and registration department was scheduled to revise the market values from August 1. The decision to not revise the rates was taken due to Covid-19, special chief secretary (revenue) Rajath Bhargava said. “Several organisations submitted representations explaining the difficulties being faced by the general public in carrying out transactions in immovable properties due to Covid-19. Keeping the issues in mind, the government has decided that there will be no revision of market value this year. The present market value guidelines will remain in force without any revision till March 31, 2022,” said Bhargava. Several district administrations, in fact, have already commenced the exercise to propose revision in market values. The committees headed by joint collectors reviewed the latest market values with district stamps and registration department officials and directed them to ready the proposals. Draft proposals are already complete in several districts and officials were waiting for final instructions from the government. Sources said the decision of the municipal administration department to go for revision of property taxes based on capital value by replacing the existing annual rental value might also have also played a role in putting the revision of market values on hold as the upward revision of market values, particularly in urban areas, would have had a severe impact on revision of property taxes based on capital value.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/no-revision-of-land-value-this-fiscal/articleshow/84275685.cms||Samdani MN

One of the ATMs was that of a nationalized bank and another of a private bank. According to police, the thieves used a gas cutter to open the ATMs. The ATM of the private bank was broken in 2019 too and around Rs 10 lakh were stolen. PK Diyora, assistant commissioner of police (west), said “The banks don’t have security guards outside ATMs. We had asked the bank to install a system which alerts nearby police stations when someone tries to break the ATM, but the system too is not working. We are calling a meeting of all bank managers to plan a strategy to avoid such thefts.” Police asked all the banks to depute a security guard and share their details with concerned police stations. Police sources said an interstate gang of ATM thieves has been active and Rajkot police had alerted cops in other districts too. The thieves come in a car and the driver, who is their accomplice, leaves the spot. The gang members then enter the ATM and down the shutters. It takes around 15 minutes to cut the ATM machine, said police. Nageshwar was merged with the municipal corporation before the civic body elections. It is learnt that police are also planning to ask the banks to shut the ATMs located on the outskirts from 11pm to 6am to avoid such incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/thieves-cut-open-two-atms-steal-rs-15-lakh/articleshow/84280607.cms||---

While projects worth Rs 500 crore were sanctioned for Badvel assembly constituency, the remaining Rs 459 crore will be spent towards beautification of district headquarters Kadapa. Addressing a public meeting, Jagan said Badvel remained one of the most backward constituencies in the state and was deprived of development due to neglect of previous governments. “To ensure this region has access to abundant water supply, Rs 650 crore has been sanctioned for construction of a lift irrigation scheme on Kundu river to supply water to Brahma Sagar project. Apart from this, Rs 300 crore will be spent on completing an 18km lining along the project,” he announced. The government will also spend Rs 36 crore towards construction of three more lift irrigation projects along the left canal of Brahma Sagar project. In addition to this, Rs 80 crore will be spent on widening the lower Sagileru canal. A bridge will also be constructed at a cost of Rs 9.5 crore at Brahmanapalli. Besides sanctioning Rs 7.5 crore towards construction of warehouses and a new RDO office at Badvel, the chief minister also announced allocation of Rs 130 crore for construction of vegetable and fish markets, commercial complexes, concrete roads and three environmental parks at Badvel. Jagan further announced that the government will spend Rs 56 crore to complete the Telugu Ganga project and an additional allocation of Rs 45 crore for construction of a plastic concrete diaphragm wall for the Brahma Sagar project. Later, he launched development works worth Rs 459 crore at district headquarters Kadapa. A major part of the funds will be spend on beautification work, enhancement of infrastructure, improvement of road connectivity, etc. “I can never be content when it comes to spending funds for the comprehensive development of Kadapa. The development of Kadapa district, which was in full swing during my father’s (YS Rajasekhara Reddy) tenure as chief minister of the state, was later neglected by successive regimes. I will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that Kadapa is showcased as one of the best cities in the country,” Jagan asserted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/will-make-kadapa-one-of-the-best-cities-in-country-jagan/articleshow/84275951.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

College principal Sister M Rashmi said the entrance tests would be held online and admissions are to be made in offline mode. The college would organise mock tests before the actual entrance test just to familiarise the admission seekers with the procedure of the online test, she said. The entrance tests for admission to the BCom Honours, BSc Honours and BA Honours courses shall be held on July 29, 30 and 31 respectively and their results would be published on August 2, 3 and 7 respectively. While the admission of students selected for BCom and BSc shall be held on August 9 and 10 respectively, students selected for the BA courses shall be admitted on August 13 and 14. She further pointed out that the entrance tests for admissions in computer applications, advertising and sales management, communicative English and media studies, mass communications, microbiology and bachelor administration would be held online between July 19 and 28. The results of all these professional courses shall be announced by July 31 and the admission of selected students would be held on August 2 and 6. The college also runs credit-based career-oriented add-on courses in six subjects, including human resource management, risk and insurance management, public relations, stress management, applied yoga and textile ornamentation and home fashion. Besides, credit-based add-on certificate courses in 17 subjects, including 3D animation, Android App development, web designing, and French, German and Korean languages are also run by the college, Rashmi said. The only autonomous college of the state happens to be the only institution under Patna University to introduce semester system and choice-based credit system (CBCS) at the undergraduate level. The principal, however, expressed her concern at the inordinate delay in conducting examinations owing to the restrictions imposed by the state government. The syllabi of all the six semesters have been completed long back, but the final examinations are held up. Consequently, a number of college girls would miss the opportunities of pursuing higher studies or jobs in India and abroad, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-womens-college-announces-details-of-entrance-tests-admissions/articleshow/84275222.cms||B K Mishra

Srinivasan has been in charge of the Kerala-based bank since September 23, 2010 and has completed three terms as CEO. An earlier request for a three-year term resulted in an RBI approval up to September 2021. In April this year, the RBI came out with fresh regulations capping the tenure of whole-time directors and CEOs at 12 years. The central bank said that in extraordinary circumstances, it may allow the CEO to continue up to 15 years. “Equipped with the experience of over 20 years with leading multinational banks in India, Middle East and Southeast Asia, Srinivasan joined the bank as its MD & CEO on September 23, 2010 and has become its longest-serving MD & CEO after the bank’s founder, late K P Hormis,” the bank said in a statement. Addressing the shareholders in the AGM earlier in the day, Srinivasan said that the bank has taken several digital initiatives. “We used the pandemic to present simple and digital products to customers,” he said. “We have integrated UPI payments with the Federal Bank app. As a result, today well over 86% of our transactions are happening digitally,” Srinivasan said. The era of artificial intelligence is something the bank will propagate in FY22, he added. According to Srinivasan, the bank was pursuing financial inclusion through its neo banking partnerships.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/federal-bank-ceo-gets-3-yr-extension/articleshow/84279147.cms||---

The development came barely two days after JD(U)’s Rajya Sabha member and national president of the party Ram Chandra Prasad Singh was inducted into the PM Union Cabinet and subsequently allotted the ministry of steel. The two senior leaders held a closed-door meeting for over an hour. Though what transpired between them at the meeting was not immediately known, the two leaders claimed everything was fine in the JD(U). When confronted, Lalan said, “We are old friends and also in the same party. No political meaning should be derived from today’s meeting. There is nothing unusual in it and meetings take place from time to time.” Asked about his name missing from the council of ministers at the Centre, Lalan said the party’s national president, RCP Singh, was authorised to speak on the issue. “When CM Nitish Kumar has clarified the party’s stand on the matter, there is no point in making any further comment,” he said. Earlier, Kushwaha rubbished reports that RCP Singh’s induction into the Union Cabinet caused resentment among others who were in the race from JD(U). “The party had never asked for any portfolio or number of berths in the new council of ministers,” he said. JD(U) state president Umesh Kumar Kushwaha said the question of RCP Singh relinquishing the post of the party’s national president doesn’t arise. “There is no vacancy for the post,” he said, adding RCP Singh was nominated as the national president of the JD(U) for a term of three years. Meanwhile, Upendra Kushwaha is set to launch his yatra from Champaran region on Saturday. During his yatra, he will take stock of the vaccination drive, meet the families of Covid victims and know about relief measures in the flood-affected areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalan-meets-kushwaha-sets-rumour-mills-rolling/articleshow/84275803.cms||Ramashankar

The district magistrate (DM) of East Champaran, Shirsat Kapil Ashok, thanked the vaccinators and the health workers for making the MMC the only municipal corporation in Bihar that has achieved the target of administering the first shot of vaccines to the people. Their security, he said, was of utmost importance. “Nearly 85% of the beneficiaries were inoculated on Thursday and the remaining on Friday. Now, they are confident that the people surrounding them are also safe,” the DM told TOI and added that those who had been left out could visit the vaccination centres in district schools. Earlier, Bankatwa had become the first block in East Champaran district to vaccinate all the residents during a two-day immunisation drive on June 21 and 22. Piprakothi and Raxaul also achieved the target of administering the first dose of vaccines to the locals on July 3. The officials involved in the inoculation drive appreciated the DM for coming up with a strong plan before vaccinating the people. “Steps like mapping of all areas, use of electoral roll for finalising the number of beneficiaries, involvement of local representatives as well as religious heads and launch of a massive awareness campaign were taken,” said an official. Asked about the difficulties the authorities faced in vaccinating the residents of Bankatwa block, which is difficult to reach, the WHO’s surveillance medical officer (Motihari), Shahwar Kazmi, replied, “When the district received 35,000 doses of Covaxin, the DM decided to use the entire stock in one block. This was a great idea because a lot of people living in remote areas are not aware of the two vaccines.” He added, “Ice-lined refrigerators were installed at the primary health centres to store the vaccines and proper mapping was done. Within two days, all the beneficiaries were inoculated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/all-18-people-given-first-vaccine-shot-in-motihari-town/articleshow/84275067.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Illegal shuttle; Step against 70 vehicles||KOLKATA: Traffic cops have found that several vehicles — almost all illegal, including SUVs, mini trucks and even personal cars — are offering shuttle services during office hours and making huge profits. Cops had so far refrained from taking action due to scarcity of public transport, the only raid taking place in this connection a week ago. However, with around 40% buses hitting the roads on Friday, police raided some shuttle services for picking up passengers illegally. Altogether, 70 vehicles were issued challans in areas like Ultadanga, Basanti Highway, Thakurpukur and Hastings. “Every sort of vehicle is ferrying people against hefty fares. A trip from SSKM to Nabanna, usually charged Rs 20, cost Rs 40. We have no jurisdiction over fares but we acted against private and goods vehicles carrying passengers,” said an officer. A Jadavpur cop said they were noting down registration numbers of offending vehicles to see if some had flouted rules repeatedly and could be identified as an illegal shuttle service. “Even office vehicles and two-wheelers are acting as shuttle cars. We are interfering only in cases where the violations are in your face. Unless the passengers reveal the information, it is not easy to nab shuttle operators,” said a sergeant. Passengers like Howrah resident Mahendra Kumar, though, said they prefer these vehicles due to crowding in buses, even as they admit potential security threats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/illegal-shuttle-step-against-70-vehicles/articleshow/84278241.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation area has 17 containment zones now and the southern fringes of the city have 16, including Mahamayatala, Kamalgazi, Sonarpur, Kheyada and Maheshtala Municipality. However, both BMC and Rajpur-Sonarpur Municipalities said active Covid cases were coming down even in these zones. “It is wrong to state that numbers are increasing. But active cases in specific zones are not coming down as much as expected,” said a Salt Lake councillor. Cops in Bidhannagar and Baruipur see this as an “added necessary measure” to ensure that Covid numbers do not spike at a time when restrictions are being lifted across the state. “In order to prevent any rever-sal of gains, stringent enforcement in some most vulnerable areas has been planned,” said Baruipur SP Vaibhav Tiwari. At Salt Lake, the six new zones have come up at stand-alone houses at BJ, EE, AB, GD and HA blocks and in Sukantanagar. Two zones from BF Block have been removed. At Sonarpur, the new zones have come up at Aikyatan at Doltala, Pragati Pally, Natunpara, Mohan Garden, Green Park and Daspara auto stand.

Your wife regularly visits and uses abusive language in my (registrar’s) office and yesterday (Wednesday) she went to the Medieval and Modern History department where you work. She created ruckus there also and was constantly hurling abuses and crying." Rebutting the charges, Harijan claimed that he is the victim in the entire episode and has filed a legal case against the woman in the family court at Tees Hazari Delhi. He also says that he has been paying money to the woman and her son for their survival. “I have submitted my reply to the registrar office on Thursday (July 8)”, says Harijan.

Similarly, Kamla was still flowing above the danger level at Jainagar and in Jhanjharpur. In South Bihar districts, the rainfall was near nil. Consequently, the water discharge through the Indrapuri barrage across the Sone fell from 4,897 cusecs in the morning to 2,034 cusecs in the evening. The Ganga was flowing far below the danger level at Buxar, Digha and Gandhi Ghat in Patna, as well as at Hathidah, Munger, Bhagalpur and Kahalgaon.

The widening of the Anandapuram-Anakapalle (51-km road) stretch via Pendurthi and Sabbavaram towns was supposed to have been completed by July 2021. Around 80% of the works are complete but the project has been delayed over acquiring land in parts of Pendurthi and Sabbavaram mandals. A few persons who have lost their land for the project have approached the court, seeking additional compensation, leading to delay in completion of project works. “If everything goes as per plans, it will take eight to 10 months to complete the project. Land acquisition in a few locations under Pendurthi mandal and Covid-19 have delayed the project. We are expecting the land acquisition issues to be sorted out soon,” said Anakapalle MLA Gudiwada Amarnath. Speaking to TOI, ADCP (traffic) Ch Adinarayana said the Anandapuram-Anakapalle stretch will be a boon for commuters in the city too. “If the project is completed, it will clear around 30 to 40% of the traffic problems on the highway stretch in the city limits and it will also reduce the number of fatal and non-fatal accidents as most of the road accidents are reported on the Anandapuram and Madhurawada stretch,” he added. Once the project is completed, heavy vehicles plying from Srikakulam to Vijayawada will be diverted at Anandapuram to reach Anakapalle without passing through the city. Similarly, vehicles heading towards Srikakulam from Vijayawada can be diverted from Anakapalle to Anandapuram where the original Chennai-Kolkata highway connects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/land-acquisition-delays-highway-project/articleshow/84275759.cms||Nalla.Babu

During the lockdown period and in the initial phases of unlocking, the entry of visitors in government offices was not allowed. In the current phase of unlocking, which started from July 7, the entry of visitors has been allowed, subject to the condition that they are vaccinated,” Katihar DM Udayan Mishra said. He added a separate counter has been set up at the collectorate where visitors can show their vaccine certificates before entering any government office. “The vaccination drive has gained momentum in the district. So far, more than four lakh people have been inoculated in the district,” the DM said, adding a mega vaccination camp was organised at 52 sites in urban areas of the district on Thursday and Friday. District immunisation officer Dr D N Jha said at least 8,715 beneficiaries took Covishield jabs on Thursday and 5,000 till 4pm on Friday. “In the urban areas, 57% eligible population has already been immunised. Overall, 21-22% people have so far been vaccinated in the district. The district has more than 20 lakh eligible population for immunisation,” Dr Jha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/4-lakh-people-vaccinated-in-katihar-so-far-dm/articleshow/84275168.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Dip in cases, easing of curbs boost footfall at Kolkata airport||KOLKATA: The decline in Covid cases, easing of restrictions in Kolkata and other cities and removal of mandatory RT-PCR tests by several states have helped revive traffic at Kolkata airport after two difficult months when arrival and departure figures had reduced to a trickle. “We are seeing a steady increase in passengers this month. Compared to the beginning of June, we have registered nearly three times the flier count in the first week of July. While the figures are still way off from what Kolkata clocked between November and February, we are hopeful of the situation improving,” said Kolkata airport director C Pattabhi. From less than 6,000 fliers a day in May-end to just over 8,000 in the beginning of June, the number has gone up to nearly 20,000 a day in the beginning of this month. In April, the number was hovering between 20,000 and 25,000. Prior to Covid, the airport registered a maximum footfall of nearly 70,000 in a day. “Business travel is picking up now and relaxation in the RT-PCR norm by multiple states has removed a major hurdle,” said Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi. Some states have also started recognising two vaccinations as a passport to travel to the state without need for restrictions or quarantine. Leisure travel, too, is picking up with people desperate for a break. With international travel still out of bounds and trains operating in limited numbers, people are opting for flights for intercity travel. “People want to avail of the opportunity for a semblance of normal life before the third wave strikes. We witnessed this last year as well with people travelling in the winter when the restrictions eased,” said Travel Agents’ Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni. Kolkata airport authorities hope the state will remove the partial restrictions on flights from cities in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. Flights from these states can operate to Kolkata only three days a week. Also, fliers have to undergo RT-PCR tests within 72 hours prior to taking flights to Kolkata. “If curbs are eased by the state, it will drive away hesitance to fly to the city and boost travel numbers,” an airline official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dip-in-cases-easing-of-curbs-boost-footfall-at-kol-airport/articleshow/84278043.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Patna||NIA gets further remand of two LeT men in Darbhanga blast case||PATNA: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday got seven days’ additional remand of Mohammad Nasir Khan and his brother Imran Khan having alleged links with Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) for further interrogation in the Darbhanga railway station parcel blast case on June 17 and their terror plot across the country. Sources said the duo's additional remand time is mainly aimed to know about their Pakistan-based international handler. The duo was produced before a special NIA court in Patna on Friday along with another accused Kafil Ansari. “Nasir and Imran have shared vital information about their terror plot, which was to be implemented across the country. They have also shared information about their handler in Pakistan who was directing them how to execute the terror attacks. Both are about to share more information for which additional interrogation time was required,” a highly placed source said. Nasir and Imran’s earlier remand of seven-day with the agency was ending on Friday. Their fresh remand with NIA would start from Saturday. Sources said NIA didn’t pray for the further remand of Kafil, who was sent to judicial custody in Beur central jail on Friday after six days’ interrogation. The NIA had taken the trio to Shamli, Uttar Pradesh and then to Hyderabad in course of interrogation. The NIA did not seek remand of Haji Salim, the 4th person arrested in the case and the alleged LeT recruiter in India, as he is ill and lodged in Beur jail amid high security. The sources said though it was Salim who recruited Nasir and Imran, Kafil also had an important association with them in the entire conspiracy. “Once, Nasir and Imran’s interrogation is complete, the NIA might take Kafil on remand again for another round of interrogation to corroborate all facts and information. More arrests may take place in the case after further interrogation,” a source said. The NIA FIR states that Nasir and Imran had planted the IED containing liquid chemicals inside the parcel and booked it in Darbhanga-bound train from Secunderabad to cause an explosion en route, but the parcel exploded while being dumped at the Darbhanga railway station. The duo were arrested from Hyderabad on June 30. Both had settled there two decades back from Kairana in Uttar Pradesh as garment traders. Later, on July 2, Salim and Kafil were also arrested from Kairana for their alleged involvement in the terror conspiracy with Nasir and Imran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nia-gets-further-remand-of-two-let-men-in-dbhanga-blast-case/articleshow/84276191.cms||Debashish Karmakar

In a fresh order, director general, school education, Vijay Kiran Anand has asked all basic shiksha adhikaris (BSAs) to release salary of only those teachers who have uploaded their high school marksheet and certificate on Manav Sampada portal, an online database of teachers created for digitisation of records. The move came after it was found that many teachers, despite repeated directives since September 2019, had not uploaded their documents on the portal. “Since teachers have their own login, they could have easily uploaded the documents. Non-compliance of the order shows the lax attitude of teachers,” the order said. The directive was issued after a status report of documents uploaded on the online portal was filed by the directorate of basic education on July 2. The report said over 21,000 assistant teachers in primary schools, 4,000 head teachers in primary schools and assistant teachers in junior schools are yet to upload their high school mark sheet and certificate. In Lucknow, out of 3,067 assistant teachers in primary schools, 2,908 have uploaded their high school marksheet and 2,804 have uploaded their high school certificate. Among 1,937 head teachers (primary school), assistant teachers (junior school) in Lucknow, 1,875 and 1,744, have uploaded their high school marksheet and certificate, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-salary-without-class-10-certificate-govt-to-teachers/articleshow/84282367.cms||Isha Jain
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Beware of the ‘black dollar’ frauds||VADODARA: A gang of five African men allegedly duping people by posing as businessmen was arrested by the Vadodara cybercrime sleuths from Delhi. Cops have seized 18 mobile phones, two laptops and fake US dollar currency notes from them. The cybercrime sleuths traced the gang after Rajesh Kumar Patel, a businessman from the city, filed a complaint of cheating of Rs 19.35 lakh against unidentified persons on July 4. “We tracked the accused on the basis of IP address, bank account details and tip-off. All of the five have been duping unsuspecting businessmen by offering lucrative business deals,” said Hardik Makadia, ACP (crime). According to the police, Patel had received several emails between October 2020 and March 2021 wherein he was offered CPU processor scrap at a cheaper rate. The accused first took 50% amount from Patel for the material and then asked him to pay more money for insuring the scrap as it was to arrive from another country. The gang then demanded more money to decode the ‘black dollars’ and settle the transaction with a customs officer. “The gang then told Patel that the scrap material has got lost in transit but they have got insurance money. They showed him black coloured US dollars and took more money from Patel by claiming the currency needed to be cleaned. Patel realised that he had been cheated and filed a police complaint some days ago,” Makadia added. “Their modus operandi was very elaborate and well-planned. The accused first sent emails to the victim and offered lucrative business deals. When the victim got convinced, they asked him to transfer money under some or another pretext. Once the money was transferred in different bank accounts, their agent withdrew it and the gang used to disappear,” Makadia told TOI. The cops have traced four bank accounts in Manipur and one in Delhi. Those arrested have been identified as Benjamin Ndri, Kaptu Ematurin, Kitii Devalois, Martin Ndimou El and Hadji Toure, all residents of different countries in Africa. “The gang has its members in Africa who first send emails to the victims and then contact their Indian accomplices to execute the racket,” Makadia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/beware-of-the-black-dollar-frauds/articleshow/84279281.cms||---

Several issues pertaining to environmental clearances delaying projects were also raised. The associations also requested financial help from the state government to set up offshore and onshore effluent discharge pipeline projects in the PCPIR region.  “We also requested setting up a business and convention centre along with a Centre of Excellence at Bharuch which will benefit all the seven industrial estates. GIDC has assured to provide suitable land for this purpose,” sources added.

Govt will provide all support to the units which have created lacs of jobs & propelled the economy. Our team had a fruitful meet with stakeholders and assured them to solve pending issues.” Unit owners also sought help in development of townships at Atali and Kesrol along with social infrastructure like school, hospital, gardens, affordable public transport facilities in the estates along with domestic waste disposal facilities in each estate to tackle pollution issues. N K Navadia, past president, Federation of Association of Industries and Ankleshwar Industries Association said, “The initiative of industries and mines department to meet association office-bearers and understand the gravity of many long-pending issues is a proactive step.

---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: No revision of land value this fiscal||AMARAVATI: In a big relief to people, the state government has decided against revising the market values of land during the current fiscal. The stamps and registration department was scheduled to revise the market values from August 1. The decision to not revise the rates was taken due to Covid-19, special chief secretary (revenue) Rajath Bhargava said. “Several organisations submitted representations explaining the difficulties being faced by the general public in carrying out transactions in immovable properties due to Covid-19. Keeping the issues in mind, the government has decided that there will be no revision of market value this year. The present market value guidelines will remain in force without any revision till March 31, 2022,” said Bhargava. Several district administrations, in fact, have already commenced the exercise to propose revision in market values. The committees headed by joint collectors reviewed the latest market values with district stamps and registration department officials and directed them to ready the proposals. Draft proposals are already complete in several districts and officials were waiting for final instructions from the government. Sources said the decision of the municipal administration department to go for revision of property taxes based on capital value by replacing the existing annual rental value might also have also played a role in putting the revision of market values on hold as the upward revision of market values, particularly in urban areas, would have had a severe impact on revision of property taxes based on capital value.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/no-revision-of-land-value-this-fiscal/articleshow/84287961.cms||Samdani MN

A couple of other senior executives have also put in their papers in recent months. Responding to a query from TOI, Paytm said in a statement: “As a company, we do not comment on personnel changes. We have built an incredible management team with some of the most reputed names in the industry, who are focused on driving growth at Paytm.” Nayyar, a former Goldman Sachs executive, had joined Paytm in 2019 and was responsible for the financial services vertical and was also looking after new launches such as broking, insurance, lending and wealth management. The exits comes ahead of the fintech company’s general meeting of shareholders on July 12 where it will seek approval for its proposed initial public offering (IPO). Following the meet, Paytm plans to file its draft red herring prospectus. The EGM will also see shareholders vote on changes to the company’s employee stock option plan. Paytm has said that no class of employees would benefit as a result of the changes, and they are aimed at enabling the IPO. Earlier this week, Paytm saw a major reshuffle at the board level, which saw the entry of Douglas Feagin of Ant Financial and exit of a few other executives from the Ant/Alibaba Group. Besides Feagin, Ashit Lilani of Saama Capital and Vikas Agnihotri of SoftBank also joined the board.

The lawyer regretted the incident when the bench warned him that he should take appropriate care in future while appearing before it and should also maintain decorum at all times. A bench of Justice Jaspreet Singh made the above observation in the course of hearing in an old appeal filed in 1980. As the bench started hearing via video conferencing on July 5, it noticed a lawyer appearing for the respondents Udai Bhan Pandey was accompanied by another person who was visible bare body and without a shirt. Frowning at this, the bench indicated to Pandey to disconnect, but he still remained connected. To this, the bench reacted saying, “The conduct with which counsel has treated the virtual hearing so casually is not only appalling, but is discourteous and shocking and such behaviour can’t be tolerated."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lawyer-gets-hc-rap-for-being-casual/articleshow/84282405.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

The mother, known as Basanti, is a fully grown adult leopard and is usually spotted in the periphery of Jhalana. This is the seventh cub that has been spotted in the area this year, taking the big cat population to 39. According to experts, Basanti was first spotted in 2015 and is around eight years old, though it is not confirmed if the leopardess has given birth before. This recent cub appears to be a couple of months old. A recent study revealed that the density of leopards is too high for an urban jungle. With new cubs being regularly born, the sub-adults are getting pushed out. In search of territory, these wild cats venture out and go missing or get killed in territorial fights. With the leopard population on an upward trajectory, there is an expected spillover to adjoining areas of the reserve. Ideally, one male leopard requires at least 5 sq km area. The department is planning to develop the surrounding forest areas, including Galta, which is over 700 hectares. The Jhalana forest area is spread over an area of 20 sq km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/7th-leopard-cub-spotted-in-jhalana-reserve-this-year/articleshow/84280526.cms||---

School education minister Varsha Gaikwad told TOI that under Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, which controls the fee issue, the state does not have the power to interfere. “A file has been put up to see what changes can be done and we may go with the ordinance route for now. It may come up in the next cabinet meet itself,” she said. A grievance redressal mechanism has been built into the system where step-by-step, “aggrieved parents” can escalate the issue. However a key committee, called Divisional Fee Regulatory Committee (DFRC), became operational in June after a gap of over a year. Due to its absence earlier, parents and schools clashed over the fee issue before public representatives, education officials and even the judiciary.  The state too realized that, as of now, it legally cannot dictate schools to lower or waive off fees of students, hence the process of considering changes started.  Gaikwad said, “If amendment in the law is to be done then we can look into it during the next sitting of the legislature.” According to Constitutional experts, an ordinance is the quickest route for the government. Former state attorney-general and senior advocate Shreehari Aney said, “The cabinet can pass the ordinance but it will have to be approved by the governor. Once approved, it’s valid for six months and can be extended.” He further said the amendment in law issue can also be taken up at the cabinet. “They can declare their intent to amend the law, which ultimately will be done when the House is in session,” Aney said. The BJP-led government, under whose tenure the law was passed, too realized difficulty in provisioning for state to dictate fees. Former school education minister Vinod Tawde, a BJP neta, said it would have been legally untenable. “The Right To Education Act (RTE) says children are entitled to free education. This, the state is doing through its own (ZP etc) institutes and aided-schools. But there was no provision through which private school fees can be dictated by the state,” Tawde said. Minister Gaikwad too has not revealed whether the proposed ordinance also aims to empower government to cap fees or waive it. A senior education official, who did not wish to be identified, said, “I don’t think the government will do that as it will be challenged in the court. In Mumbai, children of rich family attend these high-end schools and if their fees are capped then the schools will severely hit financially. Every school’s fee is a result of its own infrastructure and popularity. Maybe the ordinance will give us (officials) power to adjudicate to some extent in fee disputes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-planning-ordinance-to-tackle-school-fee-issue/articleshow/84280473.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The two-day event, which ended on Sunday, pegged on the theme ‘No Man is an Island’. Historian Fakir Aijazuddin set the tone on the first day as he enunciated the ideas of author and journalist late Khushwant Singh. The inaugural session had art historian Vidya Dahejia in conversation with author William Dalrymple, delving on her book ‘A Rediscovery of India in 100 Objects’. Vidya narrated the course of Indian history through objects ranging from 200 BC down to 1874. She harped on different cultures that made their entry into the country over the years and enriched Indian ethos. Nostalgia and pathos overtook the second session in which former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's UK-based friend, Victoria Schofield, deliberated at length on her book, ‘The Fragrance of Tears’, based on life and experiences of Benazir. In conversation with Javed Jabbar, who has been also a close associate of Benazir, Victoria recalled how after Benazir's assassination when she visited her grave she was asked to leave the country by the powers that be and she came to India.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Security hold area being expanded at airport||AHMEDABAD: Flying through the city airport? You may see a more spacious area the next week on. Authorities at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad have undertaken the expansion of the security hold area of the city airport, confirmed well-placed sources. The airline cabins located near the check-in area are being shifted.  “To expand the security hold area, airport authorities are doing away with the cabins allocated to various airlines right behind the check-in counters. This will open up a lot of space around the security hold area and will help reduce the crowding at the city airport,” said a well-placed source. In times of the pandemic when the protocol requires maintaining social distancing, more passengers can be accommodated in the airport premises and there will be lesser hassle. SVPI airport records movement of an estimated 10,000 passengers in a single day. “The expansion has been undertaken factoring in the surge in passenger movement in the days to come. If we do not brace for the third wave of Covid-19 as projected, there may be crowding. The changes have been brought about keeping this in mind,” said the source. The security hold area is spread over 1,500 square metre and with the removal of the airline cabins, it will further be expanded by about 10%, which will open up a substantial space. Sources confirmed that in the days to come, more space for passengers to sit will also be created for passengers. The renovation work will be completed by early next week. The airline offices which are being removed, will now be shifted on the first floor of the arrivals area of the domestic terminal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/security-hold-area-being-expanded-at-airport/articleshow/84280602.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Man cuts off ‘ghar jamai’ son, high court upholds will||AHMEDABAD: Forty-six years on, the Gujarat high court has upheld the validity of the will of a man who bequeathed nothing to his son for remaining a ‘ghar jamai’ and not taking care of him. The man left his property to his grandson. The case involved Diwala Gausa Chaudhary who prepared the will in 1975. He died some time later. He gave his two small parcels of land to his grandson Sonaji Raghala. He ignored his son Akha Diwala, saying that since his marriage in 1950 Akha chose to stay with his in-laws and did not take care of him. Chaudhary preferred his grandson because he lived with Chaudhary since childhood. Akha filed a suit in a court in Mandvi questioning the validity of the will. Akha argued that his father was not in a sound state of mind when the will was executed. He asked for his share of the property claiming that his father had died intestate. The Mandvi court rejected his plea. Akha approached an appellate court in Surat, which accepted his case by holding that Chaudhary was not in a proper state of mind and the property was purchased with the family’s money. The appellate court in 1981 ordered the district collector to partition the land and allowed Akha to have his 50% share. The grandson approached the HC against the order of partitioning of the property. After a pendency of 29 years, the high court finally concluded, on July 2, that Chaudhary had executed the will in a sound state of mind. The will was valid because the property was self-acquired and Akha could not have his share in it, the court said. The HC also referred to the contents of the will in which Chaudhary mentioned that his grandson was maintaining him since Akha left him to reside with his father-in-law. “Since plaintiff (Akha) has not maintained his deceased father Diwala Gausa, it is natural for the deceased to exclude his own son from getting any share in the self-acquired properties,” the court order reads. “…and there is nothing wrong in bequeathing the entire properties to his grandson who has maintained the deceased.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-cuts-off-ghar-jamai-son-high-court-upholds-will/articleshow/84280624.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Family in lurch as sole earning member caught in crossfire||NEW DELHI: Sanjay (25), the passerby who was killed when some criminals fired at a property dealer in north Delhi’s Filmistan Road area on Thursday night, was the sole earning member of his family. His elder brother lives separately. His father, Jaipal, who remarried after Sanjay’s mother’s death, said it was his younger son who would give him money for his monthly expenses and come and meet him. The youth’s relatives and family members said he did menial jobs. On Thursday, he was walking towards Rani Jhansi Road to try and get work on a bus as a helper or cleaner. His cousins said he was religious and would at times sleep in Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib. On Friday, Sanjay’s family members were inconsolable outside the mortuary. His aunt, Jaipali, who brought him up after his mother’s death, couldn’t control her tears. She said, “Since the age of five, he had been living with us. We live in a joint family, but his father remarried and started living with his second wife in Gautampuri. On the day of the incident, he came home around 8.30pm and told my husband that he was going to look for some work. He was earlier working in Punjab. He didn’t have a fixed job. He made it a point to do sewa at the gurdwara.” Gulveer Singh, a family friend, said Sanjay was a religious person and had recently returned from Vaishno Devi. “He used to work on my bus as a cleaner. He was trying to look for another job. He was hardworking and a very pious person,” he added. “All my dreams for him have been dashed. He would make sure to meet me on festivals and even gave me money for monthly expenses. I have three children from my second wife, who are very young. He was my only support and his death is a big jolt to me,” said Jaipal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/family-in-lurch-as-sole-earning-member-caught-in-crossfire/articleshow/84280650.cms||---

Under this programme, the health workers will visit door-to-door and administer medicine free of cost. Speaking at a workshop, chief medical officer Dr Nepal Singh said to protect people from contracting filarial disease, a filaria abolition programme would be launched in the district from July 12 to July 16. The health workers would administer medicines free of cost to the villagers. Filaria is caused due to mosquito bite and it is a contagious disease. It is generally known as elephant feet disease. Its main symptoms are swelling in feet and hands and also hydrocele problems in some cases. After infection, its symptoms appear often 5 years to 15 years, Dr Singh added. “Under the mass drug administration (MDA), Ivermectin with Albendazole or DEC medicines are administered which kill the microfilaria. Ivermectin helps in killing hookworms and dangerous parasites in the abdomen. This medicine is not administered to children below two years of age, pregnant women and seriously ill persons. It should not be consumed on an empty stomach. Ivermectin is generally administered to children of more than five years”, the CMO said. The health workers would administer medicine to the eligible person before himself .Dose of Ivermectin depends on height and dose of DEC & Albandozole was based on age, Nepal Singh added. A K Singh, district malaria officer said that patients suffering from blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis and other general diseases can also take these medicines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/mass-drug-administration-campaign-in-district-against-filaria-from-july-12/articleshow/84278736.cms||---

Prof Das said that this project contest was about establishing the ‘Open Innovation model’ for in silicon drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2. The idea submitted from the team in CGD, BHU was about the potential use of phytochemicals to combat Covid-19. According to him, around 3,777 phytochemicals were screened from 41 different medicinal plants and then molecular docking was performed on chosen 1,427 compounds to test their ability to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The team finally concluded that two lead molecules which strongly interact with their active site thereby are predicted to hinder the activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and ORF8. He said that these results can be further used towards development of drugs by using appropriate formulations and taken further for clinical use after performing safety trials. Considering the low toxicity, less side effects and bioavailability of these compounds, using these phytochemicals for exclusively targeting the viral proteins can be an excellent strategy towards our crusade against Covid pandemic. The team included research scholars from CGD Prashant Ranjan, Chandra Devi, Neha Jha, Prashasti Yadav; Dr Garima Jain, Dr Chandana Basu, and Dr. Bhagyalaxmi Mohapatra (associate professor, Department of Zoology) and Dr Vinay Singh (assistant professor, School of Biotechnology).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bhu-team-submits-idea-of-using-phytochemicals-to-combat-covid-19/articleshow/84278839.cms||---

While 17 doctors put in their papers on Thursday, others joined on Friday. A letter written by agitated doctors stated en masse resignations were triggered by the DM’s misbehaviour. They also submitted a memorandum to the commissioner, Devipatan division, which straddles Gonda district, and requested him to act against the DM. The letter also said the DM encroached upon rights of senior departmental officials and was controlling transfers and postings, while regularly hurling insults at doctors. “All additional chief medical officers and medical superintendents worked round-the-clock during the pandemic, but Gonda DM has been using objectionable language against us during assessment meetings and field inspections. Keeping public welfare in mind, we continued to perform our duties, including Covid vaccination and sampling,” read the letter. It added the DM’s behaviour towards ACMO Dr AP Singh during meeting was inappropriate and this hurt superintendents of community health centres. Copies of the memorandum were marked to the health minister, director general health and government doctors’ association. The doctors’ body maintained the complaint was not new. They cited similar incidents from Rae Bareli, Unnao and Aligarh where bureaucrats crossed the line of dignity. A few months ago, Provincial Medical Services Association had taken up the matter with higher authorities, but nothing changed. When contacted, Shahi said: “A communication gap led to this unexpected situation. There is pressure to perform on various counts but in a moment of stress a misunderstanding hurt the doctors. They were later invited to talk and the matter was resolved amicably.” The doctors association refuted the claim. “No doctor has taken the resignation back,” an association member said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/20-govt-docs-quit-to-protest-gonda-dms-misconduct/articleshow/84282542.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The civic officials removed two under construction halls near Haibowal police station. A few women had protested against the drive by coming out in front of the JCB machine so that structure could not be removed. However, the civic officials took help from nearby police station and the police team removed the protesting ladies from the spot so that demolition could take place. Earlier, the officials removed sheds constructed inside a school behind Sarabha Nagar market, as the shopkeepers in the market were using the sheds as godowns. Once the officials removed the sheds, they went to Ghumar Mandi to remove the shutters in the basement of building — owners were using them for commercial purpose, whereas in the approved building plan it was to be used as parking. Finally, one under construction structure was removed at Rahon Road. The building inspector Jagdeep Singh said there was no problem in removal of encroachments anywhere except Haibowal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mc-demolishes-2-under-construction-halls-amid-protest-in-haibowal/articleshow/84276079.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Water pouring through leaky New Market roof causes global concern||KOLKATA: Videos and photographs of water pouring through the nearly century-and-a-half-old iconic New Market’s roof triggered concerns from not just other parts of the country but from across the globe. Jolted by the reaction, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) that owns and manages the heritage market said it had taken up restoration of drainage lines in the area. But engineers said the bigger problem was the leaky roof that would have to be carefully repaired and restored to ensure the market did not suffer a major damage. Marilyn Cousens from Perth, David Riddler from Melbourne, Darryl Buckley from London and Christine Tsatsaroni from Athens were among scores of foreigners who expressed sadness and even outrage over the condition of New Market that had charmed them during their trip to the city. As majestic and famous as the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul, they rued that New Market with its rich heritage had been allowed to fall into such disrepair. “Without the basic maintenance of the iconic landmark, feel it is doomed,” Buckley wrote on Facebook. Riddler and Tsatsaroni said they felt sorry for shop-keepers. Water seepage has been a problem that shop-keepers at the market have faced for years. But what used to be a trickle from the roof in a few blocks has turned into a downpour this monsoon, damaging goods stored in lofts and seeping into electricity ducts that has raised fears of short-circuit. The problem has been compounded by water gushing up from the drain lines in the passages. The KMC market department’s engineering cell has taken up restoration of drainage lines in and around New Market. “We sent a team from our engineering cell to assess the drainage network following severe water logging in New Market. After assessing the reasons, the team has started clearing choked drainage lines,” a civic official said. While this will solve the problem of water gushing up from of the manholes, it will take much longer to tackle the problem of water pouring down from the roof. A team of engineers are assessing structural damages to the building caused by seepage of water through the roof. “This cannot be done in a hurry. We have to study it carefully and then plan the repair,” a civic official said. Sources in the KMC market department said unauthorised construction by a section of staff who reside in quarters on the roof had also exaberated the problem. Cracks have appeared on the roof. A few years ago, a child had slipped through one such gaping hole near the market’s central rotunda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/water-pouring-through-leaky-new-market-roof-causes-global-concern/articleshow/84278565.cms||Saikat Ray

Konkan Railway’s regional traffic manager, Madgaon, B B Nikkam, said that the Exim facility provided by Concor at Balli will provide fillip to Goa’s export trade. “We hope that Konkan Railway and Concor will thus be able to contribute significantly towards the growth of Goa’s economy. In the years to come, the park will definitely prove to be a game changer for Goa’s industrial scenario,” Nikkam said. Concor has been working closely with industry leaders in Goa, including Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), to attract more freight container traffic to the multi-modal logistics park. The park was inaugurated in March 2018 with an investment of Rs 43 crore as per the MoU between Konkan Railway and Concor. The park has been dealing with domestic traffic, and has now been equipped with all the infrastructure needed to handle Exim container traffic as well. Warehousing space of 2,500sqm has been created at the park and it was informed that a host of value added services will soon be made available to its users. The park is spread over 84,000sqm. “At this inland container depot, we will provide single window facility such as custom examination and clearance, storage of export/import cargo, bonding and transshipment cargo. The depot provides efficient and cost-effective services like cargo aggregation and disaggregation, inter-modal transfer sorting, packing and re-packing,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/concor-terminal-opens-for-exports/articleshow/84282564.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Futile wait for transport outside Hadapsar railway station||PUNE: Passengers arriving at the Hadapsar railway station on Friday morning after travelling overnight from Hyderabad had a harrowing time with little or no public transport available for their onward journey. Around 80 passengers had booked on the tri-weekly train to Hadapsar and close to 30 to 40 passengers got down at the Hadapsar station. Rakesh Shakarwar (23), waited for 20 minutes for an autorickshaw before he decided to walk to the main road, around 1.5km away, to try his luck. “How can a station have no public transport? I have to go to Swargate but can’t figure out how to reach there.” Just then two ladies came out of the station carrying a small girl and three bags. “We thought there would be some form of public transport available at the station, but here there is none,” one of them said. After waiting for half-an-hour, one of them made a call and a man came on a motorcycle to pick them up. On Thursday, the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd had dropped the idea of starting a bus service to and from the station owing to the narrow approach road and encroachments along the way. “Even a midi-bus cannot move along the narrow road. After conducting a survey of the area, we have come to the conclusion that we will not be able to ply buses to the railway station, Encroachments are also a major problem along the road. We had hoped that the rail administration would take steps in this regard but they have not,” a PMPML official had said. A young lady, who had travelled alone, waited for more than 30 minutes for an autorickshaw before she decided to book an app cab. Middle-aged Ravindra Gaur was lucky to spot an autorickshaw a few metres away from the station but when he requested the driver to drop him at the Pune Railway Station, the driver demanded Rs 250. Just then, another passenger came along and they decided to split the fare. Another passenger, who had asked his relative to pick him up, said, “I knew about the issue and had planned accordingly. How can the rail authorities start a train without sparing a thought for public transport? Forget buses, there is no space for autorickshaws to park here,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/futile-wait-for-transport-outside-hadapsar-station/articleshow/84280707.cms||Joy Sengupta

Cabral said that citizens, who still have some objections and suggestions to offer, can submit it in writing to the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) by July 15. He also said that the CZMP currently being prepared is the 2011 one. “Immediately after this plan is finalised, work on the 2019 plan will begin. If there are any issues with the 2011 plan, the 2019 plan is there to carry out any further corrections,” Cabral said. Both Cabral and chief minister Pramod Sawant said that North and South Goa collectors had carried out the public hearings to their satisfaction. “The CZMP hearing was conducted systematically by the two collectors on Thursday. There is a pandemic and what could be done under the circumstances was done,” Sawant said. Cabral said that he wants to congratulate the collectors for a job well done. He also said that he was thankful to the citizens who turned up to give their objections and suggestions. “The collectors took good control of the situation and held the hearing satisfactorily. They gave levy to some speakers in the 15-minute time slot depending on the situation. The plan has to be finalised as many people are affected due to it not being finalised. There are some elements who will never be satisfied. This is the fourth time a public hearing is being held. Three times we have postponed the finalisation of the plan,” Cabral said. GCZMA member secretary Dashrath Redkar said that the minutes of the public hearing will be available online for checking by Saturday morning. “Participants can check if whatever they have spoken has been correctly recorded. They can write to us till July 15 seeking any corrections,” Redkar said. Cabral said that, post July 15, suggestions and objections received will be scrutinised and the plan will be sent to the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennai, to carry out any corrections. Once the state receives the updated draft CZMP from the NCSCM, it will be sent to the environment ministry for notification, he said. About complaints of inconveniences at the public hearing venues, like leaking roofs, Cabral said, “There may be small glitches here and there. The important part was holding the hearing. When there are so many people it is impossible to satisfy everyone 100%. We should now be able to prepare the CZMP.” He said officials were at the venue finalising the minutes of the meeting till 3am on Friday. “I thank the people for giving their objections and suggestions for making a wonderful plan for Goa. The entire procedure of the hearing is complete. In principle the process of public hearing is over,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hearing-completed-in-principle-public-can-give-written-inputs-till-july-15-cabral/articleshow/84280738.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Calcutta high court no to CBI probe into fake vaccination case||KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court on Friday turned down a CBI probe plea in the fake vaccine scam saying, “at this stage the facts do no warrant investigation by the CBI.” A HC division bench of Justice I P Mukerji and Justice Aniruddha Roy, however, said that whether a CBI probe is “necessitated in future” will “depend upon the conclusion of this investigation, the result of it and the subsequent steps taken by the prosecution further to it.” The HC said in such cases later a fresh plea may be moved before the HC. The bench said that the probe till now “does not show that there is any deficiency in the conduct of this investigation that should compel the court to order investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation.” Senior advocate and MP Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya had stressed in the HC that “there is a likelihood of involvement of political and government officials in this misdeed. It was part of a larger conspiracy. Powerful and influential people have roles to play. The investigation is tardy, slow and does not show any real purpose.” Bhattacharya had argued that due to the near similar reasons the Supreme Court had ordered a CBI probe in the Ponzi scam. The HC, however, felt that though “It is true, that an offence of this type has rarely been seen” and “it is astonishing how a person could impersonate as an IAS officer and a high official of KMC, and operate a bank account, in its name for a significant length of time, conduct vaccination drives and other activities without being detected.” The HC also said that “Debanjan Deb along with his collaborators have been able to deceive a large section of innocent people, lure them to take vaccination from him at a serious risk to their lives.” But it also pointed out that “from 22nd June 2021 the authorities have woken up.” It said the probe report submitted by state advocate general Kishore Datta to it, shows “steps have been taken with promptitude to apprehend the accused and to make a full-fledged enquiry into the alleged offences.” The HC also noted that probe has been carried out daily and the accused are in custody. The HC also said that the SC in its CBI probe order in the Ponzi cases “has also said that the order for enquiry or an investigation by the CBI has to be sparingly made.” The HC also remarked that “the case at hand is a very unique one. Nothing similar to this is in public memory.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hc-no-to-cbi-probe-into-fake-vaccination-case/articleshow/84278623.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Stop befooling Punjab’s protesting farmers, CM Amarinder Singh tells Sukhbir||CHANDIGARH: Accusing him of attempts to “befool the farmers by announcing poll promises that the current state government had already started executing long ago”, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Friday asked SAD chief Sukhbir Badal to check his facts first. Trashing the Akali chief’s announcements for farmers who lost their lives fighting against the farm laws of the central government, the chief minister termed them as a last-ditch effort by Sukhbir to woo back the farmers whom his party had alienated over the farm laws. “Do you think Punjab’s farmers are fools to be taken in by your desperate statements,” asked the chief minister, asking Sukhbir to stop cheating the people of the state with such “deceitful announcements”. “We had made these announcements while you were still busy conspiring with your political masters, the BJP, to destroy our farmers.” The chief minister was reacting to Sukhbir’s statement that if the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) comes to power, it will give jobs, health cover etc to the families of Punjab farmers who had died during the prolonged agitation against the central laws, “which were legislated with the approval of the Akalis and the Badals, who were then part of the central government”. Ridiculing Sukhbir’s “pipe dream” of the Akalis coming to power in Punjab, “whose people he and his party had ruined during the 10 years of the SAD-BJP rule”, Capt Amarinder said with his frivolous promises, the SAD president had proved his total absence of any connect with the people on the ground. Claiming that his government was already giving compensation of Rs 5 lakh each to the families of such farmers, the CM said of the 237 Punjab farmers who had died so far during the ongoing agitation, the families of 191 had already got the recompense, totalling Rs 9.46 crore. Compensation for the rest of the families was also under process and would be paid off long before the Akalis even finalise their campaign for the elections, he added. The chief minister claimed that he had personally announced jobs for the kin of the deceased farmers several months ago and the revenue department was in advanced stages of finalising the candidates. As for the promise of health cover, Amarinder asked Sukhbir: “Don’t you even read the newspapers?” The incumbent Congress government in Punjab had brought all the farmers under the state health insurance cover through its ‘Sarbat Sehat Bima Yojana’, the CM said, adding that the Akalis were deliberately misleading the farmers with their false promises, which they could not implement since the schemes for the same were already in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/stop-befooling-punjabs-protesting-farmers-amarinder-tells-sukhbir/articleshow/84280713.cms||---

Though the party is busy reorganising its cadre in UP, it is yet to make up its mind to select partners or to go alone in the elections. The NCP registered its presence in UP in 2001 when it got its office in Lucknow. In 2012 and 2017 assembly elections the party had contested independently. “We contested 117 seats in 2017 on our own. How it will be this time cannot be said as of now. We are in talks, but being a national party we cannot just go with anyone,” said UP president of NCP Umashankar Yadav. The state unit of NCP has reorganised its structure in at least 68 districts of UP. Party office-bearers are visiting districts to review the organization. “We are reorganising the party structure in Purvanchal. We will be in Mau on Saturday,” said Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ncp-keeps-options-open-for-up/articleshow/84282575.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Kanpur||Kanpur: Four found guilty in Remdesivir scam in LLR hospital||KANPUR: Two nursing staff and two pharmacists have been found guilty in connection with Remdesivir scam in Lala Lajpat Rai (LLR) Hospital run by Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial Medical College. In the scam, during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, Remdisivir injections were allegedly issued in the name of dead Covid patients. District magistrate Alok Tiwari on Thursday issued a letter to the principal of GSVM Medical College for action against the four employees found guilty in the investigation report. Prof. Sanjay Kala, however, said this episode was reported before he took charge as a principal of GSVM Medical College. “Therefore, we would soon call for a meeting to decide the future course of action,” he told reporters. To recall, the committee headed by the chief development officer (CDO) had submitted the report in this regard to district magistrate (DM) Alok Tiwari. The Remdevisir injections were issued from the store in the name of the two patients who had already died due to coronavirus. During the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, there was a crisis of Remdesivir injections in the market. People were ready to spend Rs 50,000 to Rs 55,000 for procuring the injection. Taking advantage of this, black-marketeers started selling injections at premium rates. A few days later, it came to light that Remdesivir injections were issued against the names of the two Covid -19 patients admitted to the LLR hospital, and who had already died. “Those injections were also shown to be administered to patients,” sources at LLR said. The matter was brought to the knowledge of then principal of GSVM Medical college Prof. RB Kamal under whose jurisdiction the hospital comes. On the basis of the report of the inquiry committee, he suspended the sister in-charge and pharmacist of the neuroscience centre of Covid-19 in the hospital and issued show-cause notices to eight nursing staff. At the same time, the DM had also ordered an inquiry. A three-member investigation team was formed under the supervision of CDO Mahendra Kumar, in which ADM (City) Atul Kumar and CMO were also included. The committee had recommended action in the report considering two pharmacists and two nursing staff guilty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/4-found-guilty-in-remdesivir-scam-in-llr-hospital/articleshow/84278325.cms||---

Meanwhile, the councillors of other parties have raised objections to the proposal saying mayor was trying to avoid ANSWERS to the questions of councillors about pending development works in their respective wards. After the onset of Covid-19, two house meetings took place — one was held in Rose Garden in November 2020 while other took place in Guru Nanak Dev Bhawan in March this year. If this meeting takes place, then it will be the third meeting in nine months. Leader of opposition and senior Akali Dal councillor Harbhajan Dang said, “When Covid cases were at peak, the house meetings took place in open and now when cases are almost under control, the mayor wants a virtual meeting. We are against this virtual meeting as it will not serve the purpose.” He said they will meet the mayor over this issue and will convince him because it is only in house meeting that elected representatives get a chance to raise their voice for their wards. Meanwhile, senior Bharatiya Janata Party councillor Sunita sharma said, “The mayor wants to avoid queries of councillors about garbage management and payment to the firm for lifting garbage without giving tenders through proper channel.” She said they will not let this happen and will oppose the move. Lok Insaaf Party councillor Swarandeep Singh Chahal said, the mayor can fix the number of councillors in the meeting if he does not want to gather many people at one place. He said LIP councillors will discuss the same with mayor. When contacted, mayor Sandhu said, “It is advisable to avoid gathering due to Covid-19 and even state government is not allowed such meetings, so I had proposed the virtual meeting.” He said if councillors are having any issues, he will discuss with them because safety is important especially when the third wave is imminent according to experts. “When cabinet meetings can take place virtually, then why not MC house meeting,” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mayor-proposes-virtual-house-meet-councillors-of-other-parties-oppose/articleshow/84276118.cms||---

SAD was a part of the serving BJP-led NDA coaltion in the central government when the three laws were passed on September 17, 2020, in Lok Sabha and three days later in Rajya Sabha.

He estimated the deaths of farmers at over 550 till now. Sukhbir said the government will provide free education to kin of the deceased farmers till postgraduation level. He also promised medical insurance to farmer families, for which the state will pay and upon forming the government.

---||Delhi||Delhi airport's terminal-2 may be back in action by July end||NEW DELHI: Terminal-2 (T2) at the Delhi airport may resume operations as early as the end of July if the footfall continues to increase at a rapid rate, officials say. While the daily footfall at Indira Gandhi Inetrnational Airport had dropped to around 18,000 passengers in the middle of May, it has crossed the 60,000 mark now and officials say T2 could be made operational soon if it crosses the 80,000-mark in the next 15 days. At present, only Terminal-3 (T3) is operational, handling both domestic and international flights. While T2 had become functional last October, the operations were suspended in May once again after the footfall dropped owing to lockdowns in several states. According to the data, T2 was made operational last year — after the national lockdown — when the daily footfall had reached around 1 lakh passengers. “However, it is easier to maintain and run operations at T3 at the moment and no change will occur unless there is a sustained increase in the footfall,” said an airport official. The footfall touched the 62,000 passengers-per-day mark in the end of June and hovered around 60,000 passengers in the first week of July, the official added. “Growth has stalled slightly, but all will depend on the demand. If more flights are required, T2 will be needed to cater to the increased footfall.” Simultaneously, work is in progress at Terminal-1 as part of the airport expansion master plan, which will see its capacity increase from 2 crore passengers per annum to 4 crore. In a recent internal survey, Mumbai, Patna, Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad, Leh, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Jammu & Kashmir have emerged as the top 10 destinations of travel from Delhi in May and June 2021. The survey has also found that following the gradual relaxation of lockdown norms, 48% of the flyers were in the “visiting friends and family” category, followed by vacation (25%) and business travellers (19%). In a similar survey carried out in June 2020 after a countrywide lockdown was gradually lifted, only 2% of the travellers were going for a vacation, with a large chunk only going to see friends and family members, followed by business travellers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/t2-may-be-back-in-action-by-july-end/articleshow/84280793.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Activists of farm organisation BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) had been holding a protest for these demands for long. Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s political secretary Capt Sandeep Sandhu, in the presence of union state president Jagjit Singh Dallewal, handed over the appointment letter in Bathinda on Friday evening and gave an assurance to withdraw cases registered for burning paddy stubble. Earlier, upset over not providing the promised job to kin of a farmer having died at the protest site at Jaito 19 months ago, activists had spent the night of July 6 at Bathinda-Talwandi Sabo road outside district administrative complex (DAC). BKU (Sidhupur), in December 2019, started the protest at Jaito town in Faridkot district to demand withdrawal of cases registered against farmers for burning paddy stubble. Jagseer died at the protest on December 7. The state government had announced ex gratia grant and job to kin and withdrawal of cases by setting up a committee. Though the compensation was provided to bereaved family, job had not been given and the cases were not withdrawn. “The government, though belated, has fulfilled its promise of job to bereaved family and withdrawal of cases,” said Dallewal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kin-of-farmer-who-died-during-2019-protest-get-job-letter/articleshow/84280748.cms||---
---||Goa||After hasty end to hearings, protesters warn against pushing ‘incomplete’ CZMP||Margao: Enraged over what they called “hasty closure” of the public hearing for finalisation of Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) on Thursday, participants who were unable to make their submissions met the South Goa collector Ruchika Katyal on Friday and demanded that the 650-odd registered speakers be given a chance to speak. However, failing to obtain any assurance from the collector, a delegation of the protesters later met director of environment over the issue. “However, the director refused to reply to any of our questions stating that the government had taken the decisions,” Abhijit Prabhudessai, one of the participants said. He said that the director of environment “admitted that the data was not collected on the ground or placed on the maps and said that committees would be sent to the villages to collect data.” “Shockingly, he further said that the plans on which the hearings were held were not draft CZMP, but pre-draft CZMP and that the draft CZMP would be prepared after data was collected and verified on the ground,” Prabhudessai told reporters. Federation of Rainbow Warriors, a group of which Prabhudessai is general secretary, in a press note, condemned the government for “trying to push an admittedly incomplete, anti-people, anti-Goa pre-draft CZMP plan and for denying tens of thousands of Goans their right to submit their views on the CZMP which will directly affect their lives and livelihoods.” “As admitted by the director of environment, the pre-draft CZMP is totally incomplete and inadequate. We warn the government that if they try to push these incomplete CZMP which promote the agenda of crony capitalists to displace Goans and destroy Goa for their greed by showing non-existent jetties and port limits, the people will teach them a lesson they will never forget,” the press note said. On Thursday, most of the speakers pointed out that the plans prepared by panchayats and vetted by locals stakeholders do no not reflect in the CZMP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-hasty-end-to-hearings-protesters-warn-against-pushing-incomplete-czmp/articleshow/84280763.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh TMC to hold stir against rising fuel prices||LUCKNOW: The UP unit of the Trinamool Congress would stage a two-day dharna against the skyrocketing prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas in the country and how the BJP government at the Centre remains unmindful of hardships of the common man due to the rising prices of the necessary commodities. The farmers’ issues will also be raised during the dharna. “It seems the cabinet reshuffle is of utmost importance to the BJP government. The plight of farmers and farm-related issues should have been the priority of the government. But this government does not hesitate in using force against farmers,” said the UP TMC president Neeraj Rai. Besides targeting the BJP at the Centre, the dharna would help the state party unit to mobilise its cadre and register presence in UP which has assembly elections due early next year. The UP TMC has added new members through the membership drive that started in April and is continuing. The new members and the existing cadre would come together to give the party a momentum in UP and bring it in the poll mode. The TMC in West Bengal has chartered its route to power because of its dharna politics. The UP unit of the TMC would also be raised on the West Bengal model of the party. After becoming the national party in 2017, this would be the first protest that the party would hold in UP on a noticeable scale with at least 300 members expected to be present at the dharna venue, which would be held at GPO in Lucknow. The party’s UP unit has been voicing concern for agitating farmers and has also extended support to the farmers’ protest against the new farm laws of the BJP government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tmc-to-hold-stir-against-rising-fuel-prices/articleshow/84282616.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Chandigarh||Govt claims on AIF exaggerated, modifications insignificant: SKM||Bathinda: Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has termed the approval of some modifications in the central sector scheme guidelines related to Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) as minor and insignificant.Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday said in first meeting of the re-jigged union cabinet, modifications in the AIF were approved, allowing APMCs to access a financing facility under AIF and APMCs to use Rs 1 lakh crore fund.SKM said Rs 1 lakh crore AIF is highly misleading because there has been no allocation of even Rs 1000 crore from the government. It has merely created a new head under which loans can be accessed from banks. The actual financing is dependent on regular commercial banks, and India’s story of banking sector mismanagements and collusions with big capitalists is well-known. The government’s role is only to provide an interest subvention of a mere 3% and some credit guarantee coverage. Only Rs 208 crore had been allocated for AIF in the revised budget of 2020-21 and Rs 900 crore in the budget for 2021-22, it said. SKM said even in terms of loans, only Rs 3,241 crore were sanctioned from AIF as of March 2021 (Rs 4,300 crore as per some subsequent media reports), whereas the AIF was announced to be a Covid-19 rescue package as though it would immediately infuse Rs 1 lakh crore into agriculture. It said that when the Narendra Modi government stands by its “corporate” agriculture laws which undermine the whole legal framework of the APMC market yards with the aim of collapsing them, merely allowing APMCs to access some more loans is an empty gesture. When the farm laws were in operation before the Supreme Court suspended them, the trade in most APMC market yards collapsed by almost half and their revenues dropped drastically. The Centre has shown that it has no commitment to build and expand the public market and storage infrastructure for the benefit of small farmers and has set upon facilitating the corporates to build private markets, storage and processing facilities, SKM said.SKM said the AIF was in fact the precursor to the three legal reforms that the Central government had subsequently attempted. It was on May 15, 2020 that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the AIF of Rs 1 lakh crore fund as part of Atmanirbhar Bharat package, and it is well worth noting that she announced it for aggregators and start-ups in the agriculture post-harvest infrastructure sector, including warehouses and cold chains. Finance minister’s announcement of AIF in May 2020 was accompanied by statements that indicated that three legal reforms were about to be brought in, which is a reference to the three “anti-farmer laws” that were brought in. It is well known that a favoured corporate house is the dominant in this sphere and has control of over one-third of India’s port volumes, the morcha claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/govt-claims-on-aif-exaggerated-modifications-insignificant-skm/articleshow/84280766.cms||---

BKU (Sidhupur), in December 2019, started the protest at Jaito town in Faridkot district to demand withdrawal of cases registered against farmers for burning paddy stubble. Jagseer died at the protest on December 7. The state government had announced ex gratia grant and job to kin and withdrawal of cases by setting up a committee. Though the compensation was provided to bereaved family, job had not been given and the cases were not withdrawn. “The government, though belated, has fulfilled its promise of job to bereaved family and withdrawal of cases,” said Dallewal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/kin-of-farmer-who-died-during-2019-protest-get-job-letter/articleshow/84289102.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Enforcement Directorate gets into jab investigation||KOLKATA: The Enforcement Directorate has started a probe into the alleged fake vaccine scam in which Debanjan Deb has already been arrested by the Kolkata Police. The agency will look into the money laundering aspect of the scam in which money was allegedly siphoned off by Deb. According to sources, the agency conducted a preliminary inquiry into the allegations and went through the complaints registered by the police. On Thursday, the ED officials in New Delhi held a meeting with the counterparts in Kolkata. After a detailed discussion, the Kolkata office received a nod to go ahead with the probe. “The ED has filed an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) over the matter. The ED will probe the money laundering angle, if there is any,” an ED official said. The agency will also look into the allegations of illegal sale of oxygen and Remdesivir — a medicine used in the treatment of Covid-19. An ED official said the agency will now try to question Deb, who masqueraded as a joint commissioner of KMC and was arrested after TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty lodged a complaint. Eight persons were arrested in connection with the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ed-gets-into-jab-investigation/articleshow/84278670.cms||---

A Congress delegation led by state general secretary Janardhan Bhandari, Mahila Congress president Beena Naik and youth Congress president Varad Mardolkar demanded a custodial interrogation or a high-level departmental inquiry into the case. “The survivor should get justice in this case, and this case should not be dumped with high-level pressure,” Bhandari said. He said that so many days have passed since the formal complaint was lodged by the survivor, but no action has been taken by the police. The woman had filed a police complaint against the PSI attached to Mormugao police station for allegedly raping and cheating her. “The police department has failed to arrest and suspend the accused PSI. Instead of arresting and suspending him, the PSI was transferred from Mormugao police station to south district reserve line. Why is the special treatment been given to this PSI?” Mardolkar said. “The way police authorities have handled the entire issue and failed to give justice to the victim has raised serious concerns about the integrity of the police force,” said Mardolkar. Reminding the DGP of the horrific Nirbhaya case which shook the entire nation, Naik demanded strict and immediate action against the police officer and any senior officers who are trying to protect him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-demands-action-against-cop-accused-in-rape-case/articleshow/84282725.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Agri use pushes up power demand||Ahmedabad: With farmers irrigating their fields using groundwater in the wake of stalled monsoon, the consumption of electricity in the agriculture sector has gone up. Farmers’ increased electricity consumption has pushed up the overall power demand across the state. The state’s peak power demand on July 8 surged to 18,799MW, a rise of 15% over maximum demand of 16,302MW recorded on July 1. The data was compiled by the Western Region Load Dispatch Centre (WRLDC), which is a central government entity. )On July 9, the demand stood at 18,386MW as on 5pm, according to the State Load Dispatch Centre-Gujarat, a unit of Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation Limited. Power sector experts attribute the surge in demand partly to higher consumption in the agriculture sector. With the monsoon delayed, farmers are drawing groundwater using pumps. The demand has also gone up as the state government has increased the time for the supply of power for agriculture by two hours a day from July 7. Now, farmers are provided electricity for 10 hours as against 8 hours previously. “The daily demand from the agriculture sector has shot up to more than 85 million units (MUs); it was about 60 million units over the past four days or so,” said a source aware of the matter. The demand has shot up also due to the increase in temperature and the reopening of shops and commercial establishments after the easing of Covid-19 curbs, said power sector sources.

The first run of the rake mounted on the viaduct was held on Thursday night, on kilometre-long stretch from Vanaz depot to Anandnagar station. Vanaz-Garware College is the second priority stretch, with the Pimpri-Dapodi section of the PCMC-Swargate line being the other. This also would be the second stretch to host trials after the Pimpri-Dapodi section. MahaMetro officials said there were pre-trial runs aimed to checking technical parameters. The actual trials will begin in a few days, officials said. “Preparations for the official trial run are underway. We started with the pre-trials from Thursday. We are checking all the parameters essential to the official trial run. The entry and exit of the rake from the depot is a crucial part of this. Our team is inspecting all technical parameters,” said Hemant Sonawane, general manager (PR), MahaMetro. Initially, the rake ran slow over the one-kilometre stretch. “No major hiccups were reported,” an official said. Officials said that the entire viaduct on the 5 km Vanaz-Garware College stretch was recently completed. Work had been pending at two spots — near the Paud Phata flyover on Karve Road and near Shivtirthnagar on Paud Road. The rake run towards Garware College station in a phased manner, officials said. MahaMetro has also expedited construction of the stations on this priority stretch — Vanaz, Anandnagar, Ideal Colony, Nal Stop and Garware College. A source said MahaMetro was keen on completing all the work on at least one stretch by August 15. The work on Pimpri-Dapodi stretch is at an advanced stage; two stations are nearly complete, and trials conducted so far have been successful, the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pre-trial-runs-of-metro-rake-begin-on-vanaz-priority-route/articleshow/84278760.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Goa||Sero survey under way for kids in Goa, 15-20% have antibodies||PANAJI: An ongoing sero survey of children under 18 years of age in the state has revealed that 20-25% of children in South Goa and 14.5% in North Goa have antibodies to the Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2. The first sero survey of children undertaken by the district hospitals of North Goa and South Goa is expected to be completed by the end of this month. “We want to find out how many children were infected and asymptomatic by doing antibody tests. It is done for children who do not have any Covid-like symptoms or Covid-19,” said Dr Ira Almeida, head of the pediatric department, Hospicio Hospital. In South Goa, over 600 children have been screened so far and plans are to cover another 400 kids. The South Goa survey is likely to be completed in two weeks. In North Goa, only 165 children have been screened so far and the survey will take longer to complete as it started only in June, as the district hospital was treating Covid-19 patients until two weeks ago. The survey so far has thrown up surprising results, and even one-year-olds have been found to be positive. “We did antibody tests for toddlers brought for immunisation and some of them had antibodies. That means their mothers were positive and they did not know that,” Almeida said. In Mumbai, the positivity rate among children was 50% but in Goa, it seems to be less. The survey, she said, will reveal the burden for the expected third wave. The experts have warned that children may be infected in larger numbers if there is a third wave, as the vulnerable population is yet to be vaccinated. “The proportion of children who tested positive in the antibody survey in North Goa has been less compared to South Goa. Our sample size is small, as we started only a month ago,” said Dr Chetna Khemani, a senior pediatrician at North Goa district hospital. Khemani said that the seropositivity rate could be more in South Goa, as during the second wave, Covid-19 cases were highest in Margao and Ponda. Although Panaji, Porvorim and Candolim also had high caseloads, the two centers in South Goa comparatively had the highest numbers and still do. “In the second wave, entire families were found to be positive, rather than just one or two members. When a full family is affected, the children stand exposed, and they may or may not have symptoms,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sero-survey-under-way-for-kids-in-goa-15-20-have-antibodies/articleshow/84280847.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Woman who alleged property grab and made suicide bid dies||LUDHIANA: Puja, a resident of Chawni Mohalla, died at DMCH on Thursday, six days after she attempted suicide. Her kin claimed to have recorded their statements with the police and handed over a copy of her suicide note. However, the police are yet to lodged an FIR. In the suicide note, the woman has accused 12 persons, including police inspector Bittan Kumar, his councillor father Surinder Atwal and brother Sajan Atwal, for allegedly trying to grab her property. The woman had attempted suicide at her house on July 2 and her kin had lodged a complaint with commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal on July 3, following which a probe was marked to additional deputy commissioner of police-1 Pragya Jain. Puja’s mother, Amar Kaur, told the TOI, “I want justice for my daughter. She was being harassed as the accused wanted to grab our property. The police are also not listening to us and harassing us. Cops have recorded our statements.” Navdeep Sethi, who is the foster brother of Puja, said, “Instead of registering a case, the police are harassing me. As Puja’s mother is an elderly woman and unlettered too, I am pursuing this case. Inspector Bittan Kumar has been threatening to implicate us in different cases. There is also a threat to my life. I have stopped going home out of fear as the cops can anytime take me to the police station to pressurise me.” “The police are asking us to hand over the original suicide note, but we have submitted a copy. We fear they will destroy the original note. I am so fed up with the system that I also feel like committing suicide. I have also written a suicide note and handed it over to a close friend,” he added. On Friday, Puja’s relatives met joint commissioner of police (city) Deepak Pareek with a fresh complaint to get an FIR lodged. The complaint states that in 2013 Amar Kaur wanted to get her properties transferred in Puja’s name. Since Amar Kaur is illiterate, she sought help of the accused councillor and realtors. But they fraudulently transferred the properties in the name of accused Ravinder Singh, son-in-law of realtor Gurcharan Singh, and another property in the name of Pardeep Kumar, who is brother-in-law of councillor Surinder Atwal. The family said they were unaware about it till 2019, when they received court summons to vacate the properties. Since then the accused have been harassing Puja and her mother to vacate, the complaint said, adding that the accused threatened to implicate them in false cases. The complaint has also named three stepsisters of Puja and one stepbrother-in-law for grabbing FDs of Amar Kaur. Inspector Bittan Kumar said the allegations were false, which would be proved in the probe. Assistant commissioner of police (central) Waryam Singh said, “The kin of Puja have not come to record their statements yet. An FIR will be lodged once the statements are recorded.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/woman-who-alleged-property-grab-and-made-suicide-bid-dies/articleshow/84276197.cms||Payal Dhawan

Complaints related to staff in other departments not resolving visitors’ queries on time will also be taken up via the helpline. The civic body has assured serious action against defaulters if the complaints are found to be true. At a press conference on Friday, mayor Shyam Sunder Agrawal said that he would listen to the people’s complaints on the helpline number from 12 noon to 1 pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. “Apart from the helpline number, which will become operational on Monday, a box has also been kept outside the mayor’s office in which people can drop their written complaints. If any officer or employee of EDMC demands bribes or misuses his official power, record their calls, click photos and complain against him on the above number. We will not tolerate corruption in any form,” said the mayor. Agrawal added that there was no beldar in the building department. “If any imposter troubles you, then you must ask him for his identity card. If he does not show it, inform police and us. All the officers and employees of EDMC have been instructed to go to the field by wearing identity cards. Some mischievous elements who extorted by pretending to be a corporation employee were caught by police a few days back,” said the mayor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpn-helpline-to-prevent-harassment-to-house-owners/articleshow/84280884.cms||---

Though the central government recently announced that it would issue five lakh free visas, it is yet to allow commercial international flights. Goa government’s scheme allowing reduction in landing charges is also in the offing, but incentives offered are yet to become a reality as international tourists are still not permitted. “If the government plans to start international commercial flights say two months from now, the announcements have to be made now to facilitate booking by charter travellers,” president of Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG), Nilesh Shah said. It will give travellers time to plan their holidays. In its absence, potential travellers may be diverted to other destinations. Besides, tour operators will not be able to start their marketing activities unless they know when flights will start, Shah said. “Starting of charters will help small hotels that were closed after the pandemic started,” Shah said. While Goa saw starred hotels opening after the first wave ebbed in October-November last year and domestic flow increased, three star and smaller hotels remained closed as they are dependent on charters. The hospitality industry will also request Naik to intervene to reduce GST for hotels on priority, among its other demands, he said. TTAG will seek a meeting with the Union minister along with tourism officials during his Goa visit and explain in detail the issues plaguing them. “The meeting is yet to be scheduled, but we have spoken to his personal assistant,” Shah said. He said it is very much in the interest of the state’s hospitality industry that a leader from Goa has been given a tourism portfolio when the industry has been in crisis for over a year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ttag-to-approach-shripad-to-push-for-restarting-charters/articleshow/84280841.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Checks on his passport revealed that the entries were genuine. Among the countries that Ray Chaudhuri had visited was South Africa in 2018 where he had attended the BRICS summit. Police are also talking to a CA with whom he had rented the office space in Dalhousie. Sources said that though two of them had decided to split the rent, it fell on the CA to clear dues after Ray Chaudhuri stopped payments. “This indicates that he did not have cash at some point of time. We need to find out how a person who had financial difficulties could afford such foreign trips and also travel extensively within the country,” claimed a police source. Chaudhuri had claimed that he was in Johannesburg for this summit in 2018 and that PM Narendra Modi had attended it. The lawyer also claimed that he was part of another high level Indian delegation to Tokyo in 2013. Cops have alleged that he had tried to “illegally” capture a costly property in Gariahat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lens-on-fake-counsels-foreign-trips/articleshow/84278765.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kolkata||Calcutta high court lifts stay on teacher hiring||KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court on Friday vacated its stay on the recruitment of the upper primary teachers after the West Bengal Central School Service Commission published the new interview list with breakup of marks and giving reasons why a candidate didn’t figure in the list. The HC said this case has been pending for over five years and it doesn’t want “to keep this matter pending for even a single day.” Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay in his order, however, laid out a detailed grievance redressal system laying emphasis on a senior commission officer giving a personal hearing to candidates who may be aggrieved by the recruitment results. Justice Gangopadhyay stressed that unless this is done the aggrieved person will always harbour a doubt that the orders “had been passed mechanically and without application of mind.” Laying down the process to hear out the grievances of candidates who do not make the cut, justice Gangopadhyay in his order said the complaints can be e-mailed or submitted in hard copy within two weeks. The Commission will appoint officers not below the rank of a Secretary to hear them out and this entire exercise must be completed by 12 weeks. The state advocate general Kishore Datta tried to point out that personal hearings could prove to be a logistical nightmare with thousands of grievances, but the HC said it was necessary. The HC, however, said this didn’t apply to those who didn’t qualify for the first State Level Selection Test, 2016. The HC also requested the state and the Commission to consider “whether in the next selection test for the Assistant Teachers in Upper Primary Section age relaxation of five years can be given to all the candidates who participated in the first State Level Selection Test which was initiated in 2016.” The HC said, “In the meantime five years have passed. A large number of candidates may not get any further opportunity to appear in the next selection test for the posts of Assistant Teachers in the Upper Primary Schools if the age relaxation is not given to them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/subrata-hc-tet/articleshow/84278813.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

CM Pramod Sawant said that those who do not comply would not be allowed to report to work till they receive the jab. “(I) chaired the task force meeting to review the preparedness for the third wave. The government has accepted various suggestions of the expert committee, including mandatory vaccination for all those who come in regular contact with children below the age of 18, such as staff of educational institutions,” said Sawant. The state won’t let unvaccinated persons report to work “for the safety of our children”, the CM said. Epidemiologists have warned that a third wave may hit the state in September. Preparations on to protect 4L childrenAnd when it does, experts have said that there’s a good chance that it will affect a large number of children. Preparations are on in the state at present to protect its paediatric population before the third wave hits. The state is looking at a paediatric population of about 3.5-4 lakh, including around 2.5 lakh children below 12 years of age. Earlier, the state expert committee had decided that lactating mothers having children below two years of age and women in the 18-44 age group having comorbidities should be vaccinated on priority, so that their children are protected. Following this, the state is now targeting those working with children, like teachers, for mandatory vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-goa-vax-mandatory-for-those-who-work-with-kids/articleshow/84280883.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||No vaccine for foreign tourists, Bengaluru hospitals await govt’s approval||BENGALURU: Expats, international students and diplomats living in India are being administered Covid-19 vaccine but foreign tourists are not part of the drive. The lack of a policy, experts say, could prove shortsighted as tourists could end up getting infected and spread the virus, especially with international travel opening up. A middle-aged man from a West Asian nation on a short visit to Bengaluru approached United Hospital in Jayanagar, Bengaluru, on Thursday seeking a dose of Sputnik vaccine but the hospital had no clarity on whether it could be done. He was sent back without vaccination. “We have asked BBMP for guidance on vaccinating the man. We have collected his details. But we can provide vaccination only after getting a go-ahead from the government,” said Dr Vikram Siddareddy, founder of United Hospital. Foreign tourists face vax hurdlesHowever, this is not the first instance of foreign nationals being denied vaccination in Bengaluru. In the last two months, three foreigners visited Victoria Hospital, associated with Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI), and only one of them, a Dutch national, got the shot. “The foreign national was carrying a PAN card and said that he has been living in Bengaluru for the past two years and frequently visits the Netherlands. Because he was carrying a valid identity card issued by the Government of India, he was provided with the first dose of Covid vaccine. But we could not vaccinate the two other foreign nationals as they did not carry any ID card issued by the Indian government,” said Dr Ranganath TS, nodal officer for Covid vaccination. When contacted, Arundhathi Chandrashekar, mission director of National Health Mission, Karnataka, said that Covid-19 vaccination is open only for Indian citizens, unless they are diplomats, students and employees working in India. However, a member of the state technical advisory committee told TOI that the Centre’s guidelines need to be revisited as vaccination is a basic healthcare need. “As long as the foreign national is living in India, like anyone else, s/he is vulnerable to Covid and if infected, s/he can potentially spread it to others. In the interest of public health, foreigners must be allowed to take the vaccine,” the member said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-vaccine-for-foreign-tourists-hospitals-await-govts-approval/articleshow/84284378.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Goa||Sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet pushing more kids towards obesity||Panaji: Over the months, as the pandemic has unfolded, people have been left grappling with not only its medical, but also social and economic fallouts. One of these is increasing obesity among the paediatric population. Where Goa already had a high number of overweight children, the pandemic has only served to compound the situation by way of restricted movement due to curbs. Youth, who were otherwise active, have been forced into a more or less sedentary lifestyle with online classes and zero physical activity and adding fuel to the situation is junk food, the state’s doctors have found. “Over the last 10 years, the overall impression was that obesity cases were rising. Covid-19 has added to the problem as children are stuck at home. All their normal activity has been restricted. Doctors in the state are seeing an increase in cases,” a senior paediatrician, Dr Harshad Kamat said. While there are no studies carried out prior to and after the pandemic to represent the figures in terms of percentage, paediatricians said that their observations show that the numbers are going up. Another senior paediatrician, Dr Shivanand Gauns, said that 30% to 40% of his patients are obese. He said that the pandemic might have restricted children’s physical activity, but it was up to parents to encourage them to undertake some sort of exercise and reduce their screen time. “You see children sitting in front of a TV and eating junk food and drinking soft drinks. This is only adding to the problem,” Gauns said. Senior paediatrician Dr Chetna Khemani said that two weeks ago she saw a 14-year-girl who weighed 70kg. Her excess weight was due to her wrong lifestyle, Khemani said.“For the last 15 months children are at home and so there will be problems. Parents should take up joint physical activity, any kind of exercise, walking maybe, involving children. It would also serve as a distraction from the negativity around,” she said. Kamat said parents must get their children to interact with other children, but within limits and by following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Doctors further said that while obesity is directly linked to inactivity, it was up to the parents to ensure that their children at least develop the right eating habits. “It is difficult to break a child’s bad eating habits, so parents should see to it that eating junk food is not encouraged, and that the bad habit is nipped in the bud,” Kamat said. Khemani said that the Indian mentality that a fat child is a healthy child is also in a way responsible for obesity among children. All the paediatricians concurred that most parents want their children to be “chubby” which they equate to being healthy. Gauns said that he even sees toddlers weighing 15kg because parents are overfeeding them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sedentary-lifestyle-unhealthy-diet-pushing-more-kids-towards-obesity/articleshow/84280908.cms||Bindiya Chari

Bithika Ghosal’s kidneys would be retrieved and transplanted through Friday night. Prior to this, the state recorded five deceased organ donations this year. The Uttarpara homemaker was pillion riding on her husband’s bike on July 3 as the duo headed to a wedding ceremony. Bithika fell from the bike sustaining severe head injury. She was brought to the Bypass hospital in the wee hours of July 4. “A team led by neurosurgeon AV Prasanna conducted an emergency surgery on that night itself. Despite all efforts we could not save her,” said Ruby General Hospital general manager (operations) Subhashis Datta. On finding signals that the patient was suffering a brain stem death, doctors informed about the situation to husband Pradip Ghosal, a teacher in a private school. “I tried my best and so did the doctors. But I was told that my wife was brain dead while all her organs were still alive. Doctors said I could donate her organs so that she continues to live in others,” Pradip said. The two kidneys have been allocated to SSKM and Charnock Hospital. This will be Charnock Hospital’s maiden deceased organ transplant surgery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kols-second-organ-donation-in-a-week/articleshow/84278858.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Sawant appeared to hint that the curfew would be continued, but with some additional relaxations. A final decision is likely by Saturday night or Sunday. “Whether the lockdown will be extended or not will be known on Saturday,” the chief minister said. “People must realise one thing, everything cannot be opened right now,” said Sawant while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event. “The positivity rate is still hovering between three and four per cent and even now, there are three to four deaths per day. Due to this, we may have to consider extending the state curfew by a few more days,” the chief minister said. Sawant said that the state authorities will review the situation and see what kind of relaxations could be introduced and which curbs would remain in force in the week ahead. Goa reported 220 new cases on Friday with 17 new hospitalisations. Two people lost their lives to Covid-19 while the recovery rate neared 97%.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the state has incurred a major loss of revenue, but expressed optimism that Goa would bounce back. Finance secretary Puneet Kumar Goel said that despite the drop in revenue, he is confident that Goa’s GST collections for 2021-22 will hit a record high. “This time, in the second wave, though we haven’t taken a complete review, there is a more than 50% loss of revenue,” said Sawant, speaking at the inauguration of the Rajya Kar Bhavan or state GST building. Though PWD began the initial construction of the building at Altinho, it was handed over to Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation and has been completed at an estimated cost of Rs 19.5 crore. Sawant said that despite incurring a major loss of revenue, the state has been able to sustain the impact and even provide relief to the industry. Sawant said that the last date for filing VAT returns has been extended, the fees, penalties and interest for late filing of tax returns have been decreased, and licenses that were due to expire during the lockdowns have been extended. Shedding more light on the state’s revenue graph, Goel said that though GST collections in April 2021 were 30% higher than the collections in April 2019, GST mop-up dropped in May and June, when the state was under a curfew to curb the spread of the Covid-19 infections. Goel said he was confident that GST collections would increase in July. “The honest tax payer will not be harassed and the dishonest taxpayer will not be spared. If we go with this motto, despite the loss of revenue in the last two months, we will post record collections in 2021-22,” said Goel. Sawant also said that during the first wave of Covid-19, when the entire country was under a lockdown, Goa’s revenue dropped to just 10% of earlier figures. “Sometimes it was very difficult to figure out how to manage the finances of the state, but I can proudly say that despite the constraints, bills worth Rs 500 crore were paid last year without putting any financial burden on the state kitty,” said Sawant. The chief minister urged VAT taxpayers and others to settle long-pending tax disputes under the one time-settlement scheme. “Under the one-time settlement scheme declared by the GST commissioner, around 11,800 people filed applications. More can come forward and settle their cases. We want to clean up the backlog. There are pending issues related to VAT, Excise, GST of the last few years,” said Sawant. Want to make Altinho admin hub: Sawant Panaji: The state government aims to transform Altinho into an administrative hub, said chief minister Pramod Sawant even as he directed the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation to prepare a design for Altinho. Sawant said that several government departments which are in the heart of the capital’s business centre are being shifted away to Altinho or Porvorim. “We want to plan and design the entire area around Altinho. In future, the state election commission office will also be reconstructed. I have instructed GSIDC to plan the Altinho area, to develop it properly,” said Sawant. The department of commercial taxes and GST, as well as the Excise department, are being shifted to Altinho into the new Rajya Kar Bhavan. The forest department has already moved into the newly-built Van Bhavan, which is also at Altinho. Altinho is also where ministers, IAS officers, and other senior bureaucrats have their official residences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-lost-50-of-its-revenue-in-second-wave-optimistic-about-recovery-cm/articleshow/84280933.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra airport development corporation policy for selling plots to small investors soon||NAGPUR: In some good news for small investors, the Maharashtra Airport Development Corporation (MADC) would soon be offering small plots to them in Mihan. Various organisations representing the industries from Vidarbha had raised this demand with the government for providing plots in the range of one acre and onwards for such investors — many of whom are ready to invest in the project but couldn’t afford the funds for big plots, which are in the range of five acres and above. MADC managing director Deepak Kapoor told TOI, “Our officials have submitted a rough draft policy based on their demands. After examining its contents, we would deliberate with all stakeholders before finalising it within a couple of weeks. It would help the several small companies which are willing to invest in Mihan.” The industries association had also raised the same demands in their meeting with Kapoor during his visit to the city earlier. They told him that they couldn't buy costly plots of five or ten acres, as they didn’t have funds for establishing big companies. However, if MADC offered them plots of one acre or less, they would be in a better position to purchase them, they said. Kapoor, also the MADC vice chairman, said the body would have declared the policy much earlier, but about 28 of its officials contracted Covid-19 during the second wave, and its office was shut down for some time. “In the last 15 days, officials worked hard to prepare a rough draft for leasing the small plots to the investors. We will make sure that the policy is fair for the investors and everything would be done in a transparent manner,” he said, adding that there was a big demand for such small plots. VED hails MADC move, says it would boost industrial development Terming MADC’s move as a “fantastic” one, the Vidarbha Economic Development (VED) Council said it would give a big boost to industrial development in the region. “It would encourage the smaller industries here that want to expand their operations. The service sector would be very keen to invest there, as it would be benefited the most. I hope the proposed policy doesn’t have stringent rules like utilising Floor Space Index (FSI) in three years. In pandemic times, the industries must be provided with certain relaxations, as it would take time for them to set up their units,” VED chairman Shivkumar Rao told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/madc-policy-for-selling-plots-to-small-investors-soon/articleshow/84280946.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Meerut||Shower plunges Meerut into darkness||MEERUT: The brief spell of rain late on Thursday and early Friday exposed lack of preparedness on the part of the Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) as the city plunged into darkness for several hours. Residents had to sweat it out almost all night long due to power cuts. City’s Balwant Nagar area faced a six-hour-long power cut from 11 pm to 5 am and so did those in Mission Compound area. In TP Nagar, the power breakdown lasted for 2.15 hours while in Lisadi Gate, the power cut lasted for around 1.45 hours at night. In Ladies Park area, there was no power for 1.35 hours while in Nauchandi, the blackout lasted for 1.20 hours. The PVVNL authorities claimed that high-speed winds along with the rain led to breakages in power lines, causing power breakdowns. Kanak Singh from Balwant Nagar who complained to the PPVNL authorities, said he was told that there was some fault. The power was restored at 2:35 am. But within 20 minutes, there was another hour-long power cut. This was followed by another cut till 6 am, he added. Similarly, Varun Gupta of Mission Compound said there was a power failure soon after a brief spell of rain around 3 am and supply was resumed at 7 am. “The PVVNL spends lakhs on maintenance and in its so-called ‘underground wiring’ but if a 30-minute spell of rain can cause a four-hour power cut, I have no idea what maintenance they do,” said Naveen Jain from Shahtri Nagar. Of the 14 districts under PVVNL, besides Meerut, there were reports of long power cuts from Bijnor and Baghpat. Asked about the breakdowns across Meerut city, Arvind Mallappa Bangari, MD, PVVNL said strong winds damaged poles and wires in several localities. “For instance, in Balwant Nagar, there was a fault in the power line due to winds while in Shastri Nagar, a telecom tower fell on our power line, causing heavy damage. It is mandatory that we resort to breakdowns whenever there are strong winds to avoid any accidents or damage to property,” said Bangari. The power breakdowns are also followed by patrolling of the areas to ascertain that there is no damage to the wiring. “After the winds stop, we do patrolling in the area that takes another 30-40 minutes. We switch on power only after we are sure that there is no damage to the wiring anywhere,” said PVVNL’s MD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/shower-plunges-meerut-into-darkness/articleshow/84276299.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Hyderabad||No coercion against Y Srilakshmi: Telangana HC||HYDERABAD: Senior IAS officer from AP Y Srilakshmi got relief when the Telangana high court on Friday directed the trial court not to take any coercive measures against the officer, who is facing a CBI case in the illegal mining episode of mining baron Gali Janardhan Reddy. Justice Shameem Akther directed the CBI to file a memo before the trial court to the effect that its probe in the illegal mining case was over and that its investigation in the border dispute would commence independent of this case. He later adjourned the case to July 16. The IAS officer’s counsel, K Raghavacharyulu, informed the court that the CBI did not file any memo about its intention to delink the border dispute between AP and Telangana from the illegal mining case despite an order from the high court. “Unless the border is determined, it cannot be said whether any illegal mining took place. On one hand, the CBI says its probe into illegal mining was over but informs the trial court that the trial is still pending,” he said. Since there was a petition pending before the high court about the border dispute, the CBI could not commence or complete the probe on that issue. “Though the CBI says it is delinking both and would prefer completion of trial in illegal mining case independently, it does not say so before the trial court,” the counsel argued. “We are seeking a stay on the case pertaining to Srilakshmi,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-coercion-against-srilakshmi-hc/articleshow/84280954.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Moradabad girl, 16, who alleged gang-rape by 8 of family over ‘honour’, awaiting medical examination||BAREILLY: Draped tightly in a red dress and trying in vain to hide a sizeable burn injury on her right arm, a 16-year-old Class X girl in Moradabad on Friday morning asserted that she was kept as a surety, raped by several men of an influential family for a week and then married off to a man twice her age. Flanked by her nervous parents and facing media persons, the minor also claimed that her earlier statement that “she wasn’t raped” was given under “duress” and also that her medical examination is yet to be conducted. The girl’s father had earlier alleged that she was held hostage over days and raped repeatedly in front of him and his wife by eight men who wanted “revenge” because her elder brother had eloped with a woman of their family. Local police, acting on the man’s compliant, had booked eight members of the family for gang-rape and abduction. But later they claimed that the girl had denied being raped. Police also claimed that the minor had also told the court that she wasn’t sexually assaulted. Soon after the Hathras gang-rape case, the Centre had issued an advisory, saying that a medical examination “must be conducted by a qualified medical professional within 24 hours of receipt of information of rape”. It has been alleged that the girl and her parents were brought to a house near Amroha railway station by their “influential” neighbours on the pretext of searching for the missing couple on June 28 -- a day after the elopement. They were held hostage there and the girl was allegedly gang-raped by the accused. On June 29, the parents were told to leave with a warning that the girl would be killed if they approached the police. The minor was let off on July 6. For the 48 hours she was in “police custody”, a period during which she was also taken for medical examination which was denied by the government hospital as her parents were not with her. Chief medical superintendent (CMS) of Moradabad district hospital Dr Sunita Gautam said that the minor was brought to them by police without any guardian accompanying her. “So we didn’t conduct the medical examination and sent them back to come with the girl’s parents,” the CMS said on record. When contacted, senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Moradabad, Pawan Kumar, told TOI, “The external medical examination of the girl was done. But she refused the internal medico-legal examination. There was only an abrasion on her elbow. We are not under any pressure and impartial investigation has been done in this case so far.” He added, “The girl is a minor and her brother eloped with a woman who lived in the same village. Both the families went to Amroha searching for the couple where they fixed the marriage of a minor girl with the brother of the woman who eloped. The girl returned with one of the accused named in the FIR and said that she was never raped and stayed in Amroha as her father asked her to do so. She gave the same statement in front of a magistrate as well.” The father, meanwhile, maintained that he never asked the girl to stay in Amroha and that the police weren't allowing him to meet her. On Wednesday, the girl was sent to Nari Niketan. And on Thursday, she was allowed to go home with parents, who called the media home the next morning. While narrating her ordeal, the girl said, “I was kept at the house of one Trilok in Amroha where I was repeatedly raped and forcefully married to Vivek. Vivek’s uncle Pintu burnt my hand and threatened to kill me. After seven days I was brought to Moradabad where I was taken to the house of a former village head. Later I was taken to a police outpost where a policeman threatened to send me to jail. There were two stars in his uniform.” She further said, “I was very scared and recorded my statement in the favour of the accused. I wanted to meet my parents but they were not allowed to come near me.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/moradabad-girl-16-who-alleged-gang-rape-by-8-of-family-over-honour-awaiting-medical-examination/articleshow/84276281.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

While Mumbai-based Earth Brigade Foundation decided to reach out to the frontline wildlife protection staff of the forest departments across India, including the Sunderbans, with instruments like oxygen concentrators, city-based Society for Heritage and Ecological Researches (SHER) has also done its bit to stand by the department staff. Earth Brigade Foundation has provided 25 oxygen concentrator machines, along with disposable nasal cannulas, across forest departments in India for use in case of an emergency until help reaches the patient or the patient reaches the nearest healthcare centre for treatment. “We have provided the machines in seven states — seven in Karnataka, six in Uttarakhand, four in Rajasthan, three in Uttar Pradesh, two each in Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh and one in Sunderbans Tiger Reserve in West Bengal,” said Sarita Subramaniam, director of Earth Brigade Foundation. SHER provided four such oxygen concentrators to four ranges in the Sunderbans, including National Park East, Bidya, Sajnekhali and Basirhat. They were recently handed over to the forest department staff in the presence of senior officials like STR field director Tapas Das and deputy field director Justine Jones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sunderbans-covid-fight-gets-o2-boost/articleshow/84278909.cms||---
---||Delhi||Passes to restrict entry of illegal hawkers, vendors at Delhi's Sarojini Market||NEW DELHI: To restrict entry of illegal hawkers and regulate crowds in the Sarojini Nagar market, the district administration has directed the associations of shopkeepers and authorised rehri-patri vendors to issue passes to their members and employees. The process will be completed in two days, said traders. All five entries will be barricaded by Delhi Police and no hawker, shopkeeper or worker will be allowed to enter or erect stalls without a pass. The decisions were taken after a joint meeting of the additional district magistrate, Vasant Vihar, with market associations, Delhi Police and New Delhi Municipal Council’s enforcement department. The meeting was called in the wake of increasing congestion and lack of social distancing. “We made it clear that the issue of illegal vendors and mobile hawkers is not getting resolved. Despite the traders trying their best, these vendors manage to come in and create congestion on narrow lanes,” said Ashok Randhawa, president of Mini Marker Sarojini Nagar. “We said that unless the entries were manned properly and illegal vendors controlled, the situation won’t improve,” he added. “Even Delhi Police officials agreed. Anyone found without a pass will be penalised,” said Randhawa. “This means an illegal seller may enter the market pretending as a buyer but can’t display his items for long. We have also requested police to deploy more personnel.” Since the beginning of unlocking, traders have taken various safety steps such as drawing circles to maintain social distance and allowing people only with masks inside shops. Ashok Kalra, general secretary of Sarojini Nagar Market Association (big shops), said they would ask the traders and their employees to wear these passes to make things simpler. “To regulate the entry of visitors, we have asked for more civil defence volunteers.” Kuldeep Singh Sawhney, its president, added that they were asking everyone to get vaccinated at a free camp being held in the nearby Navyug School in association with an NGO. Already 600 have got the shot. An NDMC official said their teams had beefed up their rounds in the market and not letting any illegal vendor or even shopkeeper occupy public land. “We don’t have any right to issue these passes, but Delhi Police can check them,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/passes-to-restrict-entry-of-illegal-hawkers-vendors-at-sarojini-market/articleshow/84278983.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Meerut||Recovery of Rs 25 crore old notes: I-T department slaps penalty of Rs 200 crore on accused in 2 years, probe on in Meerut||MEERUT: A recent tax evasion penalty-cum-recovery notice of Rs 42 crore sent to a Meerut-based businessman by the Income Tax department has brought the spotlight on an underground network of unaccounted wealth changing hands. It all began in 2017, a year after demonetization, when a tip-off led to a raid at the Meerut-based realtor's premises where Rs 25 crore in demonetized currency were recovered. According to police sources, the cash was supposed to land in Nepal (where old Indian currency was still in use) and would re-enter India via NGO donation route. The main accused, Sanjeev Mittal, 52, had refuted all charges and blamed it on a Delhi-based businessman Praveen Maheshwari who had taken the premises “on rent”. Maheshwari has been on the run ever since while four associates of Mittal – Arun Gupta, Yogender, Vinod Sharma and Naresh Agarwal – were arrested in the case. Mittal was also named in the case registered by the UP police but he got a stay on arrest from the Supreme Court on grounds of his mother’s ill health. Subsequent raids on Mittal’s business unearthed unexplained transactions made through 18 companies owned either by him or his family members. The I-T sleuths also uncovered a list of 31 entities of Meerut who had “invested” a whopping Rs 60 crore in Mittal's ventures which were mostly in cash. The list of “investors”, accessed by TOI, includes businessmen, publishers, traders, manufacturers, private university owners, etc. While the investigations are still on, Sanjeev Mittal revealed to TOI that the recent income tax recovery notice of Rs 42 crore is in addition to Rs 158 crore that the I-T department had slapped on him the previous year. According to a source in the I-T department, “The penalty could increase as investigations are still on.” Mittal, on his part, claims innocence. “First of all, the money belonged to Praveen who had taken my premises on rent. I have a rent agreement as well. Secondly, all the loans I had taken either from private lenders or banks were considered as income by the Income Tax authorities and hence tax and penalties were slapped after rummaging through the accounts running back to a decade. Even if I wish to pay the penalty, all my properties and bank accounts have been seized. Unless I operate them, how can I arrange for the fund? This is not justified,” he said. Mittal's lawyer Ram Kumar said, “Income Tax notices were sent to all those whose names are mentioned in the list of 36 lenders but no action has been taken against them so far. Regarding the tax penalty, we had filed an appeal to the appellate authority in the office of Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, Kanpur, when a recovery notice of Rs 158 crore was slapped on my client and we are going to file it yet again for the Rs 42 crore notice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/recovery-of-rs-25-cr-old-notes-i-t-dept-slaps-penalty-of-rs-200-cr-on-accused-in-2-yrs-probe-on/articleshow/84276334.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: PWD officials caught taking Rs one lakh bribe in Almora||ALMORA: Two officials of the Public Works Department (PWD), Almora, were caught accepting a bribe of Rs 1 lakh in return for issuing a NOC for a bar license. The accused have been identified as Mahipal Singh Kalakoti, executive engineer of PWD, National Highway section, Ranikhet; and Hitesh Kandpal, assistant engineer, PWD. The two will be booked under the relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act, according to vigilance sleuths. As per officials, the complainant had applied for a bar licence in 2019. He was asked by the DM’s office to secure NOCs from nine departments, including the PWD. While he secured NOCs from the other departments, the PWD didn’t issue it. When he enquired from the department about the delay, the two accused officials asked for Rs 3 lakh in return for issuing him the NOC. The complainant negotiated with them and finalised the deal at Rs 1 lakh. Subsequently, he intimated the vigilance department of the demand. Following this, vigilance inspector Hem Chandra Pandey investigated the complaint and confirmed the allegations. Thereafter, a trap was laid to nab the officials red-handed. Rajesh Kumar Bhatt, SP, vigilance department, told TOI, “After confirming the allegations, a team was sent to Ranikhet to lay the trap and nab the officials.

Viral videos of women workers being manhandled surfaced with one such clip purportedly showing two men yanking the sari of the candidate's nomination proposer in full public view. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday ordered suspension of the cops for their laxity during the Thursday violence. The incident drew sharp criticism from Opposition leaders Akhilesh Yadav and Priyanka Gandhi. Kheri SSP Vijay Dhull said that a police circle officer, two inspectors and three sub-inspectors (SIs) have been suspended. They include circle officer Mohammadi Abhay Pratap, Pasgawan SHO Adarsh, inspector, crime branch, Hanuman Prasad, and SIs - Durgesh Gangwar, Ugrasen Singh and Mahesh Pratap. Two men seen in the clip have been booked as well. Ritu Singh, the SP-backed candidate, in her complaint, said she, her aides and Anita Devi, her nomination proposer, were intercepted by a group of BJP workers. The rival workers misbehaved, pulled and tore their sari and even took away her handbag. They also tore the nomination form, she alleged. A case was registered late on Thursday, in which Yash Verma, Brij Kishore and several unidentified men were booked under IPC sections of "rioting, robbery and attempting to outrage the modesty of a woman". Section 171-F [undue influence or personation at an election] was also slapped on them. Ritu’s husband Dharamveer Singh told TOI, “We somehow submitted the nomination form to the returning officer. But, it was torn by the BJP workers. The BJP-backed candidate, who is close to a local MP, won unopposed.” The Kheri SSP said, “An FIR has been registered against both the accused. They have been taken into custody and sent to jail."

No hospital, no road in #Uttarakhand CM @pushkardhami 's native villageResidents of Tundi village in Pithoragarh… https://t.co/uJQNuuYQKE— TOI Cities (@TOICitiesNews) 1625888542000The hamlet on the India-Nepal border is part of Bamro village panchayat in Didihaat tehsil and is 5km from the nearest roadhead while the closest health facility is a community health centre (CHC) 20 km away. Deepak Dhami, a resident, said that about 25 families live in the village but they face major problems during medical emergencies. “We are demanding a motorable road near our village. It becomes very difficult for the elderly and the sick to walk or be carried on palanquins for such long distances,” she said. Vishram Ram, gram pradhan of Bamro village panchayat, told TOI that even the nearest auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) centre is seven km away from the panchayat. “This has made it very difficult for pregnant women to get proper care.” Fakir Singh, a resident, has been putting off his visit to the hospital for various ailments for a month. “Nobody is available to carry me to the health centre and I cannot cover the distance on foot,” he said. Singh added that the residents were very happy with “one of their own” becoming the chief minister and hoped that the fortunes of the village would now change. Dhami’s father, an Armyman, had moved from the village to Khatima in Udham Singh Nagar district during the 1980s. Tundi is known for its fertile land with high produce of mango, litchi and citrus fruits. But Naruli Devi, a resident, said they were unable to sell produce in the market and earn a livelihood as they did not have road connectivity. The residents might have to wait longer though. Balam Singh Bisht, block development officer, Kanalichhina, said there were no plans to provide road connectivity to the village at present. Still residents are hopeful that Dhami would lend an ear to their problems. Bhawan Singh, a resident, said that the CM should ensure appointment of teachers in the high school at Bamro. “The school has only three teachers against the requirement of seven. “We hope that the CM ensures that our children’s education does not suffer due to lack of teachers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-hosp-no-road-in-ukhand-cms-native-village-at-indo-nepal-border/articleshow/84276379.cms||Prem Punetha

The project at Kottapar, Sanguem, was completed two years after it was pursued by former SMC councillor Sanjay Raikar in his ward number 8, about 500m south of the river’s confluence (Sangam), the RTI reply states. The construction covers about 25%of its width at Kottapar, a quiet and beautiful spot in the town. At low tide, the walls on either side of the steps turn the structure into a pool. A Curchorem youth drowned here last year as the walls submerge quickly during high tide. The construction of a 100-odd metre retaining wall along western side of Raikar’s property on the river bank was another major project component. A tarred road links the steps and seating arrangements have also been done at the spot. Sanguem town derives its name from Sangam — the confluence of two tributaries, which flow down from the Sahyadri foothills. One almost encircles the town’s core area from the southern side as it reaches Kottapar and joints the other one in the north near the partly submerged Sangameshwar temple. “We were not aware about the project,” a water resources department (WRD) official said. Raikar on his part said that the council took up the project and denied knowledge about the septic tank. “Obtaining NOC for the project was the council’s job,” he said. Shaikh’s effort, though, has thrown focus on the beautification, after silence from other councillors, citizens and government agencies to the concretisation and construction of a septic tank on river banks. “We initially thought the project had WRD approval,” Shaikh said. The river flowing from hills and forest areas brought fresh water, which since decades past, was used for drinking, bathing and washing clothes by locals. The two-time councillor in her complaint to the WRD has demanded stringent action against Raikar.  “The 100-metre wall is an obstruction and works, including septic tank may pollute the river, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/beautification-at-sanguem-without-wrd-nod/articleshow/84282880.cms||Johnny M
---||Pune||‘US intel officer’ held for cheating Pune woman of Rs 10 lakh||PUNE: The cybercrime cell of the city police on Friday arrested a man (25) in a cheating case after a 28-year-old fashion designer accused him of cheating her of nearly Rs 10 lakh. In her complaint, the woman said she had met the man on a matrimonial website. He claimed to be an officer with a US intelligence agency, gained her confidence and, between April and May this year, tricked her out of cash and valuables totalling Rs 9.65 lakh. In reality, the suspect, Amit Chavan, is a water filter technician from Baramati. The police arrested him at his home on Thursday night and impounded his car. His custody was later transferred to Chatushrungi police. A magisterial court has remanded Chavan in police custody till July 12. Sub-inspector Prem Waghmare said Chavan assumed the alias of Rahul Patil and met the woman on a matrimonial site. “He claimed to be a US intelligence officer for India and Dubai. The two became friendly and decided to get married,” Waghmare said. Chavan told the complainant that he had contacts in Gujarat, who could help her buy clothes at a low rate. “On this pretext, the suspect took her smartphone, debit card and PIN, and withdrew Rs 8.37 lakh from multiple ATMs. He also took away her laptop worth Rs 1.28 lakh,” Waghmare said. The woman soon realised she had been tricked once she came to know he was not a US intelligence officer. “On visiting her bank, she found out that Chavan had withdrawn huge amounts using her debit card,” Waghmare said. “After multiple futile attempts to reach him, she submitted a complaint application on July 2. After a preliminary inquiry, the police registered an FIR on Thursday pertaining to criminal breach of trust, cheating, and impersonation under sections 406, 420 and 170 of the IPC, respectively,” Waghmare said. On how they traced him, the woman told police about the last time they met and how Chavan’s car developed a technical snag. He got the vehicle towed for repairs. She shared the vehicle registration number with police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/us-intel-officer-held-for-cheating-woman-of-rs-10l/articleshow/84280456.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Just before the pandemic broke out, Malay Dasgupta had travelled to Seraikella to shoot ‘Where the Mask Speaks the Mind’. The documentary was screened at the Kolkata International Film Festival, Madrid Indie Film Festival, SiGNS Film Festival and International Film & Folklore Festival in Trinidad & Tobago. Now, when he wants to shoot an additional segment on the impact of Covid-19 on the mask-makers, he found they have either passed away or switched professions to survive. Documentaries on Seraikella Chhau have been made even by Buddhadeb Dasgupta. “I wanted to explore a new angle. Amitava Ghosh, who helms Jamshedpur-based film society titled Celluloid Chapter, suggested I feature the mask-makers,” said Dasgupta, who had earlier made documentaries on Joy Goswami, Manna De, Gangubai Hangal and others. A working still of Kanhaiyalal Maharana being interviewed for the documentaryHis work took him the doorstep of nonagenarian Kanhaiyalal Maharana who came across as “a mine of information”. “I was surprised to see that a President's award winner with a rich travel history abroad because of his expertise in the art form living in such a modest house. While explaining the intricate process of mask-making, his comments revealed his knowledge of anatomy and physiognomy,” the director said.  Alongside his interview, Dasgupta also tracked down National Award winning mask maker Sushanta Mahapatra and his son, Sumit. The director is now in a fix when he wants to revisit Seraikella to film with them again. “Kanhaiyalal has expired due to age-related problems. The rest are facing an existential crisis,” Dasgupta said. Malay DasguptaGhosh, who is also the general secretary of the Federation of Film Societies of India, said there have no performances, invitations and rehearsals during April of 2020 and 2021. “Chaitra Sankranti has traditionally been the peak period for all Chhau dancers. But even online workshops can’t be organized because of dearth of students. As a result, mask makers had to return to their villages. They are now fully dependent on the government ration relief,” Ghosh said. A still from ‘Where the Mask Speaks the Mind’Sushanta’s workshops on mask making have been cancelled. “I learnt the art from my uncle, Prasanna Mahapatra. He is no more. I get a pension of Rs 4,000 a month. Sometimes, I make gift items. My students have all gone. Some are now selling vegetables,” he said. His son, Sumit, is tense. He survives thanks to the casual job of an electrician. “It is a bad situation for us,” he told TOI. Forty five-year-old Dilip Acharya, who also features in the documentary, now makes idols. “Veteran gurus like Kanhailalji and Bishwanath Sahu are no more. There is hardly any money in making masks. Students are not coming. The pandemic has ruined us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-impact-on-mask-makers-of-seraikella-chhau-puts-city-docu-director-in-a-fix/articleshow/84278988.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

He was taken to a private hospital but was declared brought dead. After being handed over the accidental death case of Manoj Thawkar — who had physical disability — a day ago, CID officials scrutinized the documents and collected the CCTV footage on Friday. The sleuths also spoke to the police station personnel, including senior inspector Sunil Gangurde for collecting documentary evidence and records. Though CID officials had come to the police station and the spot on Wednesday after the incident, alerted by police chief (CP) Amitesh Kumar, they formally began the probe now, having taken over the case from city police on Thursday. Senior officers of the state CID are learnt to have scanned the footages of the CCTV installed near the spot in front of the Hanuman temple at Pardi naka, where cops had tried to stop Thawkar at the nakabandi point but he tried to flee on his scooter. Sub-inspector Mukesh Dhoble of Pardi police station was injured in the process to stop him. Thawkar was later taken to Pardi police station, where he collapsed after a couple of hours. The footages of the police station were learnt to have been collected by the state CID. The CP told media on Friday that he does not support rough policing but tries to ensure legal clampdown on the outlaws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-cid-scrutinizes-cctv-footage-in-pardi-custodial-death-case/articleshow/84281030.cms||Soumitra Bose

Of the 96,000 seats in Maharashtra, only 40,000 seats were confirmed by Friday. RTE admissions are conducted at 9,432 schools across the state. The state education department is likely to send fresh allotments to applicants on the waiting list. This year, the number of seats was also reduced under the scheme as against previous years, when the number crossed one lakh. The admission process was conducted between June 11 and June 30. It was later decided to extend the deadline until July 9. However, the extension did not help boost admissions under RTE. “The confirmation has been very slow because of the pandemic. Many parents, especially from the lower economic strata, have gone to their hometowns and they have refrained from confirming admissions since classes are online. We may give a chance to applicants on the wait list if they meet the criteria. The decision shall be announced soon,” said Dinkar Temkar, in-charge of RTE admissions in Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-for-the-first-time-in-a-decade-nearly-60-rte-seats-vacant/articleshow/84281034.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The department has identified 76 families - 144 children and 66 women. Some of the schemes are free education, widow pension and health cards for children. This is the first time such a step has been taken in Muzaffarnagar, said women and child development officer, Mohammad Mushfakeem, on Friday. According to the department's officials, women members - Shivangi Balyan, Rajni Bhaskar and Shushma Sharma - are entrusted to support 76 families in the district. Those who lost their husband from Covid would get Rs 30,000. "Affected children will be given free education and provided a health card for treatment in any hospital," Mushfakeem added. Notably, last month, a survey shortlisted more than 3,000 children who lost both or one of their parents to Covid. Earlier, deputy director of woman and child development department, UP, Brijesh Niranjan, had told TOI, "Under the Uttar Pradesh Mukhyamantri Bal Seva Yojana, the state government will provide financial assistance of Rs 4,000 per month to a child's guardian until he or she attains 18 years of age." All the names of shortlisted individuals are being thoroughly examined by the department. District magistrate of Muzaffarnagar, Selva Kumari J, said, "The departments have been instructed to put on priority the cause of all Covid-19 victims and provide the benefits of 32 government schemes to those who are eligible."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/covid-victims-women-and-kids-to-benefit-from-32-welfare-schemes/articleshow/84276446.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The minister said that the amount would help in creating employment opportunities at the local level. In a meeting with forest officials, Rawat took a detailed account of the projects related to the forests. He also took stock of the vacant posts and promotion-related issues in the department. The minister directed authorities to ensure that the vacant posts are filled at the earliest and all the projects underway are completed within the stipulated time span. The cabinet minister said that forest guards have an important role in the development, protection and promotion of forests and added that “without a forest guard, no plan can be implemented on the ground”. For the growth and development of forests, he instructed the officials to carry out large-scale plantation drives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/to-check-forest-fires-rs-1l-each-to-be-deposited-into-accounts-of-4000-van-panchayats-eco-committees-forest-minister/articleshow/84276450.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Day’s delay to file chargesheet, bail for drug accused||MUMBAI: Granting “default bail” to a 38-year-old man in a drugs case as the chargesheet was not filed within the stipulated period of 60 days, a special NDPS Act court has clarified that the period has to be computed from the day the accused, Nachiket Borker, was first remanded. While the 60-day period ended on July 5, the prosecution submitted the chargesheet a day later, paving the way for the accused to get bail. The court refuted the prosecution’s arguments that the 60-day period begins a day after the first remand. “Therefore, indefeasible right of being released on bail is accrued in favour of accused which cannot be extinguished by subsequent filing of chargesheet. Hence accused is entitled to default bail,” special judge V V Patil said. The prosecution had submitted that the accused was arrested for dealing in drugs and allowing premises to be used for an offence. The probe agency allegedly seized around 3kg of ephedrine. Borker’s lawyer, Ayaz Khan, initially moved bail, submitting that he was falsely implicated. When the chargesheet was not filed in time, another plea was submitted, saying that since maximum punishment in the case is up to 10 years, the prosecution ought to have filed the chargesheet within 60 days. The prosecution said that while calculating 60 days, date on which accused was produced in court needs to be excluded. The court relied on Supreme Court and Bombay high court judgements cited by defence which held that while calculating the period, the first date of remand has to be included.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-days-delay-to-file-chargesheet-bail-for-drug-accused/articleshow/84282909.cms||Rebecca Samervel

On Friday, he also met people in a Janta Milan programme in the main hall of the official residence. The prevalent belief in political circles is that none of the CMs who have stayed in the house have been able to complete their full term. Interestingly, former CM Tirath Singh Rawat preferred to stay away from the house, but still had to make an early exit from the CM’s post. The talk regarding the jinx came about after former CMs Nishank and subsequently Vijay Bahuguna who stayed there were ousted from the CM’s chair before completion of their terms. It is believed that former CM Harish Rawat did not shift to the official residence due to this reason and instead preferred to stay in the state guest house. However, in 2017, defying the ‘jinx’, Trivendra Singh Rawat had shifted to the bungalow, located in a sprawling 10-acre area in the heart of the city. Designed in a ‘pahari’ style, the sprawling bungalow with 60 rooms was built in 2010. It has a badminton court, swimming pool, several lawns and separate offices for the CM and his staff members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-cm-dhami-reverses-predecessor-tiraths-order-to-make-official-residence-a-covid-centre-set-to-move-into-jinxed-house/articleshow/84276470.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Nagpur||Potable water: A pipe dream for 5 lakh Nagpur citizens||NAGPUR: One can boast of the Metro, flyovers and iconic Ram Jhula as symbols of development, but these will remain only cosmetic changes unless every household in the city gets piped potable water supply, a basic necessity. Even after a decade of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) embarking on its 24x7 water supply project, a whopping 142 areas, having approximately 20% of the city’s population, are yet to be connected with water supply network, forcing nearly 5 lakh citizens to depend on tankers. NMC’s water works department could take 24x7 water supply scheme to only 40 of the 75 command areas. Of the remaining, 24 command areas require additional work. “Entire city will have a water pipeline network by 2028,” said water works committee chairman Sandeep Gawai. Under Amrut scheme, Rs78 crore proposal for pipeline and other works has been earmarked for the purpose, he said. The private operator entrusted with implementing the 24x7 water supply project has failed to curb non-revenue water, though the supply for Nagpur city has increased from 540 million litres daily (MLD) to 658MLD in the last seven years. Only 300MLD is billed. “Thus, non-revenue water is about 50%,” admitted Gawai. He said measures have been started to curtail the losses and added most of the old pipelines having leakages will be replaced. He also said NMC’s water allocation is 750MLD, but we are pumping 650MLD. “On an average, we are saving 100MLD water from our reserved quota,” he said. Currently, the city has 142 non-network localities, mostly on the city’s outskirts. The NMC hires tankers to supply water to these areas. Until recently, the NMC had deployed 194 tankers, but the rising population in non-network areas made the civic body to increase the number and Prakash Bhoyar-led standing committee gave its nod to hire 265 tankers for two years. These tankers, which will be paid Rs360 per trip, would be deployed to supply potable water in non-network areas. Theft of water is another issue the NMC has failed to address. Against over 6 lakh properties in the corporation limits, the city has only 3,77,667 consumers, as per water works department record. Water supply apart, residents of many localities in Central and North Nagpur often complain of getting contaminated water. Many residents fall ill due to polluted water being supplied by the NMC. Sonu Khan, a resident of Ram Sumain Baba Nagar, said their locality and adjoining areas like Maske Layout are running pillar to post to get the issue resolved. Piped potable water for each household will be one of the qualifications for Nagpur to be tagged as a Smart City, say citizens. The water works department has failed to make alternative arrangements to combat the water crisis. The department made a shocking revelation that during sample testing of 549 wells, only five were found to contain potable water. Expressing concern, Zero Mile Foundation member Dr Pravin Dabli has demanded that the civic administration and Maharashtra Pollution Control Board must revive these wells. Citing NMC records, he said there are 854 public wells in city and not even one contains water fit for human consumption. Dr Dabli also blamed the citizens for polluting wells as many throw garbage into them. “These wells need to be covered with net to prevent dumping of trash. Every two years, the wells should be cleaned and the quality of water checked,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/potable-water-a-pipe-dream-for-5-lakh-citizens/articleshow/84281171.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Delhi||Number of surgeries at Delhi’s Apollo Hospital halves in one year||NEW DELHI: The number of surgeries conducted at Delhi’s Apollo hospital – one of the largest corporate hospitals in the city – reduced by nearly a half during the pandemic (between April 2020 and March 2021) as compared to the pre-pandemic year (March 2019 to April 2020). While the most affected surgical specialty was bariatric surgery or weight loss surgery with a reduction of nearly 88% from the pre-pandemic year to the pandemic period, sharp reduction was also seen in eye-related surgeries (-65%) and heart surgeries (-55%) among others, a comparative analysis of the inpatient and outpatient data at the 710-bedded hospital has revealed. The result has been published in Indian Journal of Medical Sciences. Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director, Apollo Hospitals Group and senior consultant, paediatric gastroenterology, said the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on both the hospital’s major medical and surgical specialties. “The only medical specialty that saw more patients was respiratory medicine with a significant increase of about 314% in admissions because of Covid-19. The surgical work was reduced significantly across all the specialties, with bariatric surgery (87.5%) and ophthalmology (65.45%) being affected the most and general surgery (32.28%) and neurosurgery the least,” Dr Sibal added. “It was observed that all the medical and surgical specialties dealing more with critical and emergency care were less affected than the others. The most urgent surgical and interventional work was undertaken with due precautions, such as liver (56.46%) and kidney (54.89%) transplants, urgent neurosurgery (65.62%), cardiac surgery (44.56%) and surgical oncology (53.6%).” A similar trend was observed in other private hospitals also. While most patients were too scared to visit hospitals fearing they might contract Covid-19 from the infected individuals, there were others who couldn’t reach due to travel restrictions imposed during the lockdown. Also, many hospitals were directed to reserve a significant percentage of their beds for Covid patients. “The Covid-19 pandemic is far from over. Therefore, going further, we need to devise ways to ensure that non-Covid services can be delivered safely even as we deal with the Covid crisis,” Dr Raju Vaishya, the corresponding author of the study, told TOI. He added that they came across many non-Covid patients during the pandemic who developed serious complications due to delayed medical intervention and landed in the emergency. “All hospitals have their employees vaccinated now. So, it is relatively safer to visit for OPD consultation or surgery. Patients should not delay visiting hospitals for consultation or surgery, as may be the case,” Dr Vaishya, a senior orthopaedic and joint replacement surgeon, said. Patient footfall has decreased significantly in government-run hospitals also. “Due to the pandemic, elective surgeries were suspended at our hospital for several months. This has led to a heavy backlog. The waiting time for surgeries, for example kidney transplant, has nearly doubled,” said a senior doctor at Safdarjung Hospital. Same problem is being faced by the patients at AIIMS and Lok Nayak hospitals also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/number-of-surgeries-halves-in-one-year/articleshow/84279522.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Jaipur||Accused should have waited for end of trial in murder case: SC||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday took note of the grant of bail to an accused in a case of honour killing in which a Kerala youth was shot dead in 2017 allegedly at the insistence of his in-laws for marrying a Jaipur-based girl of other caste, saying he should have waited for conclusion of trial.A bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana, which had earlier cancelled the bail of accused Mukesh Choudhary, brother-in-law of deceased Amit Nair, was irked over the fact that the benefit of bail was granted to him by a “two-sentence” order and despite the fact that the trial in the case was still pending.“What is this order. Why can't they wait. The anxiety of your client to get bail before trial is not correct. We had previously cancelled the bail. They should have waited for the trial to be completed,” the bench, also comprising justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy, said.After hearing submissions from lawyers representing Rajasthan, senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing for Mamta Nair, widow of Amit Nair and the counsel for Choudhary, the apex court reserved its order seeking cancellation of bail.Mamta, a Jaipur-based girl, had married Amit Nair from Kerala and a friend of Mukesh Choudhary, against the wishes of her parents in August 2015.Two years later in May, 2017, Jeewanram Chaudhary and Bhagwani Devi, parents of the woman, allegedly orchestrated their son-in-law Amit Nair's murder in Jaipur.The police alleged the parents of the woman entered her residence along with an unknown accomplice who shot Amit and a second accomplice waited in a car outside.At the outset, Jaising said, “This is not an ordinary case. This is a blatant case of honour killing in which the husband of a woman who married against her family's wishes was shot dead at point blank range. Accused was granted bail, against which I have come. There is a case of criminal conspiracy. His only defence is he was not present there. The girl was pregnant.” The senior lawyer said honour killings are prevalent in Rajasthan and in the present case, the bail of the brother of the woman was rejected on two previous occasions.“Earlier we had cancelled his bail, “The CJI said. Jaising said as she was arguing in the top court, she is getting the information that now the mother of the woman has been granted bail in the case.

The 2018 directions were in a PIL by NGO, Bombay Environment Action Group, in 2006 for protection of mangroves as forests. On Friday, another NGO, Vanashakti, in a fresh PIL filed earlier this year, sought orders to ensure such transfer of mangrove lands in possession of various departments of the state, to the state forest department. There are more than 1,500 hectares of such mangrove lands to be transferred to the Forest department by various collectors, its counsel Zaman Ali submitted during a hearing via video-conference before a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni. He said while JNPT has filed an affidavit and CIDCO mentioned it has transferred over 1,400 hectares of mangroves to the forest department, there is still over 600 hectares remaining in Navi Mumbai which is a low-lying area. “CIDCO is in possession of area of 615 hectares of mangrove forest on which biodiversity mangrove park was required to be developed as a condition of Environment Clearance grant to the Navi Mumbai International Airport,” said the counsel. The final judgment in 2018 in the BEAG PIL had reiterated interim directions passed in October 2005, directing all mangroves on government lands in the state to be declared as forests and transferred to the forest department, said Ali. He said between various public authorities there is over 1,000 hectares of mangrove land that has not yet been declared private forests, despite directions of the HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mangrove-transfer-to-forest-dept-in-mumbai-hc-seeks-states-reply/articleshow/84282533.cms||Swati Deshpande

While Kullu Police announced that those flouting norms would be fined Rs 5,000 or sent to jail for eight days, the Mussoorie administration has made a Covid negative report mandatory for those entering the town and restricted the numbers of tourists allowed in the major attraction of Kempty Falls to 150 at a given point of time. This comes just a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concern over the brazen disregard of Covid norms by people at tourist destinations and other places. Devotees throw Covid protocols to wind at Har ki Pauri in Haridwar (Photo: ANI)Shocking images on the internet on Thursday showed scores of maskless tourists violating social distancing norms at Kempty Falls. The Mussoorie district administration as well as Nainital district administration have now ordered that only those registered on the smart city portal and carrying a Covid negative report along with valid hotel bookings would be allowed to enter the towns. At Kempty Falls, only 150 people can enter the waterfall area at a time while 50 of them can be in the pool, according to Naveen Chandra Jayal, station officer (Kempty). “People will be allowed to stay in the pool only for half an hour,” he said. A large number of police personnel have been stationed in the area. RT-PCR tests will also be conducted for shopkeepers on a regular basis, Jayal added. Kullu Police, on the other hand, has announced 8-day jail or Rs 5,000 fine for those not wearing masks. Kullu superintendent of police Gurdev Chand Sharma said, “Our teams are requesting people to follow safety protocols. Tourists are not adhering to rules so challaning them aggressively is the only option to curb risk of infection.” In the past five days, 140 people have been challaned for not wearing masks and Rs 1,48,500 realised in fines, according to Manali DSP Sanjeev Kumar. Manali hoteliers, however, said that old photos of busy Mall Road had been presented on the internet as fresh pictures which could hurt their business by lowering footfalls. “We are witnessing a good crowd, but rooms in many hotels are still empty. Some old pictures of Mall Road have been circulated on the internet as new ones,” said hotelier Mukesh Thakur. Several fact-checking websites also reported that a widely circulated photo of Manali was, in fact, an old photo of the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-viral-pics-of-crowds-covid-curbs-kick-in-at-manali-mussoorie-nainital/articleshow/84276504.cms||Suresh Sharma

---||Mumbai||Three nabbed in Rajasthan for recording man’s phone sex act, extortion||MUMBAI: N M Joshi Marg police have arrested three men from Rajasthan for allegedly obtaining Rs 25,000 in two batches by extortion from a Lower Parel resident in a “honey trap” case. The 43-year-old victim approached the police on realizing he had fallen into cyber scamsters’ trap when the third demand was made. Police found videos of 60 other victims on the accused’s phones and around 200 porn videos of women. “The victim, who is married, had received a friend request from a fictitious woman on Facebook. He accepted it and later the duo exchanged WhatsApp numbers and began to chat. The ‘woman’ soon indulged in a sexual act through a video call and asked the victim to virtually engage in it too,” said a police officer. In reality, there was no woman involved; the accused had streamed a porn video. The victim soon received his own act’s two-minute video, screenshots of his Facebook page and the list of his friends from the same “woman”, saying his sexual act had been recorded and would be shared with all his contacts unless he paid up Rs 15,000. Panicking, he transferred the sum via Google Pay. After a while, he was asked to pay another Rs 10,000. When a demand was made the third time, he called the police. DCP Paramjit Singh Dahiya formed a team led by senior inspector Pratap Bhosale, PSIs Nikhil Shelke, Bhatu Patil and staff Dhodiba Thengle and Anil Rathor to detect the case. The probe team found the bank account connected to the Google Pay account in Alwar district, Rajasthan. The team found the call data records of the phone number and tracked the location in Rajasthan. Investigators then left for the northern state. The city police team along with 30 Alwar police cops, led by inspector Zaheer Abbas, first identified Sunil Rajput (23), whose bank account was used in the crime. Then the team went to identify the other accused, Zaikam Khan (32), a Class V dropout.  Rajasthan district special team (DST) too joined the probe. Meanwhile, a cyber team in Mumbai found several mobile numbers being used from the same phone through Khan’s IMEI number. Police teams, in six vehicles, landed at Khan’s house at midnight when most villagers were asleep to avoid protests in case of arrests. Khan named one more accused, Hammad Ali (26), a Class III dropout. The trio was brought to Mumbai. Videos of other victims were shared with national police social media desk to alert city cops of any complaints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-nabbed-in-raj-for-recording-mans-phone-sex-act-extortion/articleshow/84278999.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The city corporation, however, announced the plans to hold camps at five schools on Friday for the people aged 65 years and above with a total of 1,000 vaccine doses. The camps would be held at – Ramchetti School, Ammani Ammal School, Government High School at Ganapathy, Siddhapudur Corporation School and Selvapuram Corporation Primary School . The remaining dead storage is only being used to vaccinate pregnant women and lactating mothers in the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital. “We are yet to get information from Chennai on when we will get bulk doses to restart vaccination of the public,” a senior official said. However, those who can afford to pay for the vaccine are opting to get the jab at private hospitals. “In private, the process was much easier. There was no waiting time, no crowd and we received our certificates immediately with no errors,” Sanjay S, a resident of Race Course who got both his shots of Covishield at a private hospital on Avinashi Road, said. However, private hospitals like Ganga Hospital, PSG Hospitals and KMCH also ran out of vaccines on Friday. “We will receive our next stock of Covishield around July 20,” said Ganga Hospital’s spokesperson. KMCH’s spokesperson issued the same statement. KMCH has in fact placed orders for Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik. The availability of Russia’s Sputnik in the city has given some relief to the residents. It is available in a couple of private hospitals and healthcare service centres. While GKNM Hospital has been administering it for the past 10 days, AG’s healthcare has also launched the vaccine in the city. However, people going for Sputnik should register on the CoWIN app and book their slots on the website. But finding a slot is close to impossible, say people who have tried. “Slots open at 6pm usually but close off by 6.05pm,” said a GKNM officer. They vaccinate 80 to 90 people with Sputnik a day. Meanwhile, the district recorded 349 fresh Covid-19 cases on Friday. With this, the active cases have increased to 4,121 and the case tally to 2,24,376. As many as 346 people were discharged from hospitals and Covid care centres in the district on the day. The number of people recovered from the infection has increased to 2,18,158. The state media bulletin has included the death of five people on the day. With this, the toll has increased to 2,097 in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/vaccine-crisis-hits-dist-for-6th-day-in-row/articleshow/84281109.cms||---

Talking to reporters on Friday, Jawahirullah said that even if authorities wanted to remove the building constructed on government land, they should have done only after proper intimation. “But the clinic functioning for several years at Podanur was brought down without any forewarning,” he said and added that the demolition was handiwork of two officials close to a former minister. “We are planning to appeal to chief minister M K Stalin to take action against the officers.” Jawahirullah said that 88 traders at TK Market were promised alternative space during the last regime, but the promise was not kept. “The DMK government should provide traders land to set shops. Similarly, 120 people who were promised houses in Selvapuram housing unit should be allotted houses.” Pointing out that several life convicts are lodged in the prisons for several years, Jawahirullah said that many of them have been rehabilitated. “Those who have spent more than 10 years and have rehabilitated should be released,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mmk-slams-demolition-of-clinic-without-intimation/articleshow/84281125.cms||---

Mathura’s superintendent of police (city) MP Singh said that the woman was found in Allahabad and her statement was recorded before a magistrate in Mathura under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The woman allegedly slipped away with the man, 22, from Vrindavan where she had come to offer prayers with her mother on Monday. The man was booked for kidnapping following a complaint by her family members. A case under section 366 of IPC (kidnapping, abducting or inducing a woman to compel her for marriage) was registered against Ahmad Hassan at Vrindavan police station. According to police, in her statement, the girl, who is a graduate, said she was in the process of registering the marriage when the police nabbed them. However, the woman’s family had lodged a police complaint on Tuesday accusing the man of abducting her with an intention of converting her to Islam. In the complaint, the girl’s family members had alleged that Hassan was propagating Islam in the area and their daughter got influenced by him.

---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Pappampatti panchayat secretary suspended for misappropriation of funds||COIMBATORE: Collector G S Sameeran on Thursday suspended Pappampatti village panchayat secretary R Kalpana after allegations of misappropriation of funds. The collector said the findings came up after an internal inquiry into the panchayat’s fund handling, which was triggered by a few complaints. “We audited funds that came in and funds that were spent over the last three years and found that the amount of tax people paid for water and building plan approval did not match the amount that was remitted in the panchayat account. The amount on the receipt and amount in the account statements were different,” he said. Based on the preliminary finding, the collector placed the secretary under suspension and ordered a more detailed inquiry into the finances in the last three years. “In one year alone, we found several lakhs of rupees not accounted for. We suspect the actual amount that went missing over three years must be higher,” said Sameeran. The audit into the panchayat secretary and funds was conducted by the panchayat department of the district rural development agency (DRDA). The agency found the evidence of funds not matching the payment receipts issued and submitted a report on the same to the collector, who in turn ordered suspension. A senior DRDA official, who is conducting a detailed inquiry, said they plan to complete investigations within a week and submit a detailed report to the collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/panchayat-secretary-suspended-for-misappropriation-of-funds/articleshow/84281130.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Supply hurdle hits Kolkata Municipal Corporation ’s second dose vaccination drive||KOLKATA: The inoculation drive at Covid Vaccination Clinics (CVC) run by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) was hit on Friday due to the non-availability of vaccines. The dearth of the supply of vaccines prompted the civic body to run all the CVCs for the recipients of second dose only. However, in most centres, the civic health officials couldn’t vaccinate more than 100 recipients. In some centres the allocation of vaccines was so low that they could inoculate only 50 recipients. Even some of the KMC-run mega centres ran short of vaccines and had to refuse those who had queued up for vaccination. The situation at the CVCs was worse. Take the case of a vaccination centre in Baghajatin. Here, the entire vaccination process winded up by noon after the gates of the centre were opened to the public at 10am. “We could wrap up the vaccination process by noon and close our gates as we had an allocation for only 50 recipients. The rest were told to come on Saturday,” said a KMC medical officer. Bimal Mitra, a businessman had queued up in front of a vaccination centre in Sri Colony. Mitra said he was running behind schedule and was anxious to get his second dose from a KMC-run centre near his house. But he was advised to return on Saturday as the centre got an allocation for 50 recipients only. However, those, who had queued up at the KMC-run CVCs in Ultadanga—Maniktala belt for their second doses, were mostly vaccinated as the allotment to each of these centres enabled them to inoculate 100 people. According to a KMC health department official, the civic body is hoping that the crisis of non-supply of vaccines will come to an end from Monday onwards. “We have scanty stocks that will be utilized to vaccinate the recipients of the second dose on Saturday. We may resume vaccination for both the doses from early next week,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/supply-hurdle-hits-kmcs-2nd-dose-vaccination-drive/articleshow/84279016.cms||Saikat Ray

According to environmentalist K Syed, who was involved in the transplantation work, the site for the flyover has five trees – a pungan , poovarasam, iyal vakai, vadamadakki and a mango tree. “As the trees, valued for their medicinal properties, remain a hindrance to the construction work, officials decided to transplant them.

While the trend has brought smiles to their faces, businessmen here said that they are making arrangements to bring all the workers back. R Surendran, who is running an industrial unit with half of his employees, is making arrangements to bring back 12 employees within a day or two. “Buses are charging about Rs 4,000 to transport a person from Patna to the city. Even though it is an additional expense, we have no other option but to shell out as we are completely dependent on guest workers,” he told TOI. “Unlike the previous lockdown when the workers were reluctant to return, this time, they are all willing to return and have been asking us to make arrangements for their return journey.” Most of the trains operated from the northern parts of the country to the district are full, said M V Ramesh Babu, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (Codissia). “There are no train tickets available for the next one month. As bus tickets have become expensive and it is not advisable to travel in closed environment for days together, we request the railway board to operate trains that were cancelled ahead of the lockdown, and to operate special trains to bring back workers,” he said, “It is difficult to resume full-fledged operations without guest workers. The pressure to deliver products on time is tremendous. More than half of the labourers working in foundries, engineering industries, processing industries and even spinning mills are from the northern states. It is because of the lack of willingness of local labourers to work in such industries,” Ramesh added. Most of the industries, especially micro industries, are under financial distress and are managing with the existing workforce, said district president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises (Tact) J James. President of Southern India Engineering Manufacturers Association (Siema) K V Karthik said that the industries have been operating with 75% of the workers and are arranging buses and trains to bring more workers back to the district. “Unlike the previous year, there is no sharp demand for labourers. Due to the constantly rising price of raw materials, many have postponed purchase and this in turn has reduced our orders. So, we are managing with existing labourers,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/guest-workers-trickle-in-as-industrial-units-restart-operations/articleshow/84281172.cms||Nivedha Selvam

In a statement, collector S Sivarasu said Tamil Nadu civil supplies corporation (TNCSC) procured 6,332 metric tonnes at eight DPCs in the taluk during the Navarai season from June 3 to July 8. The minimum support price (MSP) for Grade A variety was Rs 1,958 and the common variety Rs 1,918. TNCSC disbursed over Rs 12 crore to farmers through electronic clearing system (ECS). DPCs have been functioning at Thangam Nagar and Aalathudaiyanpatti besides additional units at Vairichettipalayam, B Mettur and Erakudi in the taluk to procure the paddy harvested during the season. The administration said the paddy harvested during the corresponding period last year was 1,064 metric tonnes at the DPC in B Mettur. TNCSC officials said there has been a six-fold increase in paddy procurement this year despite only five centres being opened. The good yield in the area prompted them to open three more DPCs. After EPS raked up the issue of DMK interference, Sivarasu inspected the DPCs in Thuraiyur and advised the staff to expedite procurement from the farmers who were issued tokens before the next rain. TNCSC also said that a total of 66,452 metric tonnes of paddy was procured in 65 DPCs so far in the kharif marketing season (KMS) which commenced on October 1, 2020 and lasts till September 30. The farmers were given Rs 120.3 crore in lieu of procurement.

---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu cops seek details of foreigners from Bureau of Immigration||COIMBATORE: As police stations are not provided details of foreigners staying in their limits, officials from the state have sought the office of the Director General of Police (DGP) to take steps to furnish the details to check on those who overstay or indulge in criminal activities. At present, foreigners should register their visit in the e-FRRO (Foreigners Regional Registration Officers) online portal. As per the earlier system, foreigners need to register in person their entry and exit from the country at the Foreigners Registration Offices (FROs) located at the respective city police commissionerate and office of the superintendent of police. As this system is no more in place after the introduction of e-FRRO in 2019 by the Bureau of Immigration, police are in the dark about the presence of foreigners in their limit. Hence, police officials from across the state have made a request to the DGP office to take appropriate step so that they get the details of foreigners staying in their limit. “Earlier, the foreigners registered their entry as well as exit at the FROs in Coimbatore and we were maintaining the list of foreigners who were staying in urban and rural areas. We also maintained a list of foreign students. If any foreigners were over staying, the police detected them with the help of FROs and took necessary steps,” said a police officer. “After the e-FRRO was implemented, the foreign nationals need not visit the FROs and they simply registered their entry as well as exit in the online portal. The list of foreigners’ details is maintained by the FRRO, Chennai,” a senior police officer said. “After the e-FRRO system was enabled, police were not able to monitor the whereabouts of the foreigners,” said a senior police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cops-seek-details-of-foreigners-from-bureau-of-immigration/articleshow/84281145.cms||---

He is suspected to have committed suicide. His body was spotted by his landlord’s wife on Friday. In a suicide note that Kumar left behind, he said he was ending his life as he was depressed and that no one is responsible for his death. The constable hailed from Aligarh and was recruited in UP police in 2016. The suicide note has been sent for analysis to the forensic lab, police said. According to police, his landlord’s wife, who had gone for some work to the first floor where Kumar stayed, spotted his hanging body. She immediately informed the police. Preliminary investigations revealed that Kumar’s girlfriend had allegedly committed suicide last year and that could be the reason for his depression.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/cop-found-hanging-at-home-in-agra/articleshow/84276637.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The national highways authority of India (NHAI) has cited manpower shortage as the main reason for the delay. Officials said the workforce comprised of labourers from north Indian states and many were yet to return for work after going back to their homes during the lockdown. The works were progressing with around 250 labourers before the second wave of the pandemic. During the second wave, the workforce was reduced to 40. As many as 110 labourers were infected with Covid and many others returned to their homes. Most of them are yet to return back to work due to various reasons like lack of access to safe travel, officials said. Senior officials of NHAI on Friday visited the work site at Kazhakkoottam to assess the situation. They have also requested the firm that has undertaken the contract of the work to arrange alternative workforce to compensate for the shortage. “We have challenges like a possible outbreak of a third wave of the pandemic and unexpected weather changes,” said NHAI project manager P Pradeep. Meanwhile, vice-president of RDS Project Ltd, the engineering firm that is carrying out the works, Colonel M R Nair said that they were racing against odds to finish the work on time. “Having lost crucial time to the pandemic, we took some measures to resume the work to its full potential. This includes arranging flights to bring the labourers back,” Nair said. He said 70 labourers were brought back in groups of 10. The company paid for their flight charges and RT-PCR tests. They also arranged separate accommodation facilities for the labourers for undergoing quarantine. Now, works are progressing with 110 labourers, Nair said. He added that efforts were on to bring back the remaining labourers or their replacements. The elevated highway at Kazhakkoottam has a length of 2.8km from Attinkuzhi to CSI Mission Hospital Junction at Kazhakkoottam. The works were started a year ago and so far over 60% has been completed. This includes completion of a 1.6-km-stretch from Attinkuzhi to Kazhakkoottam junction. A week ago, PWD minister P A Mohammed Riyas had visited the worksite to review the progress of the work. He had then said that the works would be completed by April 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/work-on-elevated-highway-yet-to-gather-full-momentum/articleshow/84276647.cms||Rejith Balakrishnan

The senior citizen came from a well-to-do family and his son is settled in the US, and he lives with his wife in the city.“His wife got Covid-19 infection. She was first treated under home isolation, but later needed hospital admission. He had to go from pillar to post to ensure a bed for her. The bigger worry he had was about his own health – if he fell ill, who would take care of his wife?” said the psychiatrist. “He started evaluating his life. He complained of sleeplessness, feeling of fatigue and anxiety.”As the second wave of the pandemic is nearly over, it has left many scars for senior citizens who lost their dear friends or life partners, and found it difficult to move forward. While the death toll remained high in the second wave, many were fearful whether they would contract it or bring it home for other family members.At Jeevan Aastha helpline, the counsellors fielded a call from a woman in her early 70s. The woman was also from upper middle class having her two children settled abroad for several years now. “Her husband had passed away three years ago. She had a domestic help and several relatives, but she was afraid that if she gets infected by Covid-19, she wouldn’t know what to do,” said a counsellor.City-based experts said that loss of routine, overexposure to social media messages related to the pandemic and a yearning for meeting the children and grandchildren in person were some of the reasons of stress among others for many senior citizens. They added that often it got manifested with irritability or anger arising out of the feeling of helplessness.“The cases have got reduced due to reduction in Covid cases, but the need of the hour is dialogue with near and dear ones, pursue a hobby or work that one likes and engage in light exercises outdoors that can lift the mood,” said Dr Ramashankar Yadav, a city-based psychiatrist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/managing-their-silver-years-in-face-of-the-covid-pandemic/articleshow/84279033.cms||Parth Shastri

The college has proposed to convert plastic wastes into fuel and char through hydrothermal liquefaction process. It had submitted the proposal, titled ‘Design and Development of Continuous High-pressure Screw Reactor for Alkali Catalyzed Hydrothermal Co-liquefaction of Plastic Wastes in Lignocellulosic Biomass’, to the technology development programme of the ministry of science and technology last November. “Under the project, we would convert plastic wastes into fuel and char using hydrothermal liquefaction process. The char would be converted into carbon electrodes, which could be used in several things, including batteries. The research will be done with the help of industries that will feed us plastic wastes and provide analytical support,” said professor and head of department of Food Technology V Chitra Devi. “Unlike other methods, one of the main advantages of the process is that materials with moist content could also be fed and as a result, we need not pre-treat wastes to remove moist content. So, we would be feeding agro wastes, along with plastic wastes, in the process.” “The three-year project would come handy when we look for alternative energy sources due to rising fuel prices and to manage plastic wastes,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/college-bags-rs-1-cr-grant/articleshow/84281166.cms||---
---||Agra||Health department OKs robotic surgery system at Agra’s Sarojini Naidu medical college||AGRA: The state health department has approved a plan for robotic surgeries at Sarojini Naidu Medical College (SNMC) in Agra. The advanced robotic system will be used in conducting surgeries of critical patients. Besides SNMC, the robotic surgery system will be set up at GSVM Medical College in Kanpur, LLRM Medical College in Meerut and King George’s Medical University in Lucknow. Robotic technology will allow surgeons to operate with extreme precision. Areas of the body that may be difficult or even impossible to reach with the human hand will be accessible with use of the robotic system -- its “arms” can rotate full 360 degrees. According to the hospital administration, the proposal for establishing a robotic surgery system has been approved by the state health department. After cabinet approval, “da Vinci surgical system” costing Rs 35 crore will be commissioned at the super-specialty wing of the hospital. A team of experts will be training doctors to operate the advanced set-up. Dr Sanjay Kala, SNMC principal, said, “Robotic surgery is a form of laparoscopic or minimally invasive surgery in which a computer-controlled robot assists the surgeon during the procedure. The robot provides the surgeon with an increased level of dexterity and allows him to operate in small spaces inside the body that would otherwise require open surgery. Compared to traditional open surgery, robotic surgery results in smaller incisions, which reduce pain and scarring, less time is spent in the hospital and recovery is faster.” Not only does robotic surgery benefit the patient, it enables the surgeon to gain enhanced precision, flexibility, control and vision. It also allows the surgeon to perform very delicate or complex surgical procedures that may have been very difficult or even impossible without the aid of the robot, added Kala. Dr Mridul Chaturvedi, SNMC spokesperson, said, “The health department has approved a plan to set up the da Vinci robotic surgical system, made by an American company, Intuitive Surgical. It is designed to facilitate surgery using a minimally invasive approach and is controlled by a surgeon from a console. The system will play a crucial role in prostatectomies, cardiac valve repair and gynecologic surgical procedures.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/health-dept-oks-robotic-surgery-system-at-agras-snmc/articleshow/84276610.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Mumbai||Medicos to intern at institute they graduate from: NMC||MUMBAI: A draft regulation for Compulsory Rotating Internship, 2021, released by the National Medical Commission (NMC), MBBS students will soon have to undergo internship training in Ayush, along with other postings. Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, said internships are usually done in students’ own specialty. “This will also reduce their time spent in specialties they are expected to be trained in.” A senior doctor said there is no point in persuading students to do this half-heartedly. “They should be aware of Ayush, but we hope the training will be on awareness only. There was, perhaps, no need to include it explicitly in the regulations,” the doctor said. On the other hand, including superspecialty training in MBBS internship will give better exposure, said an intern from a government hospital. The NMC has also recommended that students complete their internship from the same institute they graduate from, leaving no scope for transfers. Currently, many students prefer seeking tra-nsfer from private colleges to government ones for better clinical exposure. They also seek transfers to hospitals in their hometown. Shenoy said students usually prefer to intern in their home cities. Among other changes, interns will have to maintain a record of their work in a logbook, which is to be verified and certified by the reporting medical officer. For the first time, the NMC has also spelt out the certifiable procedural skills in each discipline, which must be recorded in the intern’s logbook. Dr Avinash Supe, former dean of KEM Hospital, said including certifiable competency skills in the internship regulation is a welcome move. “Students are expected to learn these skills and document their training, as per the new guidelines. This will ensure that they are not only learning these skills, but are practically competent too,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nmc-medicos-to-intern-at-institute-they-graduate-from-in-mumbai/articleshow/84283006.cms||Yogita Rao

Though the entire admission process is going to be online because of the pandemic, teachers and other administrative staff will be needed to come to colleges for various works related to admissions. The senior teachers who are in their fifties will also have to attend regular meetings during and after the merit list is drawn up. “It is important that both the teaching and non-teaching staff are fully vaccinated when they start coming to the campus for admission-related work. Though admissions will be done online, principals, senior teachers and administrative staff will have to be present on the campus regularly from the day the admission process starts. While many have not received their second doses, there are young colleagues who are yet to receive their first dose,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-demand-by-colleges-ahead-of-admissions/articleshow/84279038.cms||---

Out of these, 10 cases were from Agra district, two each from Hathras and Firozabad, and one each from Saharanpur and Mainpuri. In July, the viral diagnostic and research lab under the microbiology department of the SNMC had sent samples of 60 Covid-19 positive patients for genome sequencing to the central government's Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in Delhi. Reports of 40 samples were received on Friday. Out of these, 16 samples were confirmed with Delta variant infection. Dr Aarti Agarwal, head of the microbiology department at SNMC, said, “Sixteen cases of Delta variant have been confirmed in genome sequencing. Most of these patients have recovered from the infection. Reports of 20 samples are still awaited. Besides, we have sent 33 more samples for genome sequencing to King George’s Medical University in Lucknow.” Dr Sanjay Kala, SNMC principal, said, “It’s good that no case of Delta-plus variant has surfaced in genome sequencing. The Delta-plus variant is more transmissible and evades the body’s immunity faster as compared to the Delta variant. People need to strictly follow the Covid-19 protocol. Getting vaccinated, wearing a face mask and maintaining social distancing will prevent us from the possible third wave of Covid-19.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/16-cases-of-covid-19-delta-variant-detected-in-genome-sequencing-of-40-samples/articleshow/84276671.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore police to tighten vigil against young drug addicts||COIMBATORE: Days after a video of seven youths injecting themselves with painkiller tablets mixed with saline drips to get a high went viral on social media, the four special teams that were formed to crack down on the young drug abusers and their suppliers picked up four of them on Friday and handed them over to the Kuniyamuthur police for questioning. An investigation officer said the video, which surfaced on social media on Wednesday, was shot a few months ago. As the video went viral, city police commissioner Deepak M Damor had instructed the special teams to nab the youths and identify the source of medicine supplies. Subsequently, the special teams collected details of the youths in the video and picked up Shahin, 19, of Kovaipudur Pirivu, Sadiq, 21, of Siruvani Tank, R Prasanth Kumar, 21, of Brindhavan Nagar and an 18-year-old youth from Ganga Nagar on Friday for interrogation. The officer said the seven-member gang was using Nitrazepam, a type of benzodiazepine drug. “It is a powerful hypnotic drug with strong sedative, amnestic and skeletal muscle relaxant contents. It will lengthen the duration of sleep. Nitrazepam tablets cannot be sold without a prescription. We had earlier arrested a pharmacist for selling the tablets to youngsters and sent a report to the drug control officer to cancel the licence of the medical shop.” He said they had warned medical shops of strict action if they were found to be selling scheduled H drugs without a prescription. It is to be noted that the scheduled H drugs cannot be sold over the counter without the prescription of a qualified doctor. The officer said the youths, who were picked up, were handed over to the Kuniyamuthur police for further questioning. “They told us that the video was shot some seven months ago from an isolated place at Kuniyamuthur. We are interrogating them to know about the drug supplier, how they managed to get the drugs and the areas where the drugs are supplied in the district.” The city police commissioner said the special teams were formed to curtail the unlawful usage of sedative and painkiller drugs to get a high. “They are tasked to track the movement of marijuana, sedative and painkiller pills, and other drugs and seize them. They had busted a gang at Saibaba Colony last month and seized sedative pills from them. They are also questioning a few young drug abusers to nab the supplier.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/police-to-tighten-vigil-against-young-drug-addicts/articleshow/84281206.cms||---

The POSH committee took the decision within days of the victim filing her complaint filed. Authorities at ESIC hospital at Somwari Peth said that immediately action was taken and the doctor working on contract with the hospital was sacked. Medical Superintendent (MS) Dr Meena Deshmukh confirmed this development. “As per law, an internal committee was formed and the action was promptly taken. We ensured justice for the victim within 5 days of filing complaint,” said Dr Deshmukh. Dr Deshmukh said they follow highest standards of woman safety at workplace. “The guilty doctor issued written apology and also apologized to the victim in front of all others, still she demanded action against him. Respecting her views, the hospital administration discontinued the services of the male doctor,” said the MS. A felicitation function was organized on Doctor’s Day at the hospital. A woman doctor was among those felicitated. The photographs taken at the function were shared on official WhatsApp group. The accused doctor circulated a photograph highlighting a specific body part of the woman doctor. This offended the woman doctor and she filed complaint under the POSH Act. As per the law, an internal committee conducted the investigations and found the male doctor guilty. Being an internal matter, no police complaint was filed. The doctor who lost his job told TOI that he had no wrong intentions. According to him, it happened inadvertently as he is “not that tech-savvy”. The doctor said he respects the decision of POSH committee and is ready to leave the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/senior-doctor-found-guilty-under-posh-act-sacked/articleshow/84281199.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

According to the plan, the state government was to plant 2.5 lakh saplings along the banks of the river. Three years hence, not much has changed on the ground and the river continues to be in a dire condition. The dumping of household and chemical waste goes on unabated along the banks of the river. The worst affected are the residents of the slum settlements along the river. They are not only exposed to several health risks but also forced to live with an unbearable stench 24X7. The situation gets worse after a rain spell when the contaminated river water triggers a host of civic issues. Abhijay Negi, founding president of student group ‘Making a Difference by being The Difference”, an organisation working towards Rispana rejuvenation, said, "There is no active rehabilitation plan for the people living along the river. Thus, it is difficult to convince them to move to safer areas. In this situation, it gets difficult for us to carry out the rejuvenation drive. The government, on the other hand, has not taken any major steps. It has only made hollow announcements." In a similar vein, Anoop Nautiyal, social activist and founder of Doon-based think tank SDC Foundation, said, "There has been no progress. The Rispana rejuvenation project that started with much fanfare ended with a whimper. Besides, the Rispana Project has also failed to become a people’s movement in Dehradun." According to a 2014 report by the National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee, the river can be revived by installing certain instruments to measure the streamflow and planting trees strategically in the upper stream catchment area of Shikhar falls and in the private premises of Woodstock School. However, none of these steps have so far been undertaken. When queried on the issue, Ranvir Singh Chauhan, vice chairman of the Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority, told TOI, “The Rispana Project is currently with the finance department. As the project is not on the floor yet, nothing can be said in terms of its progress.” Meanwhile, Dehradun district magistrate Ashish Kumar Srivastava told TOI, “The work in the river's catchment area has been completed. Also, the tapping of 170 sewers that fall into the river will be completed by the end of this monsoon. The government has also sanctioned Rs 70 lakhs to divert these sewers and has ordered some instruments to be put in the river. The rejuvenation work is being undertaken in a phased manner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rispana-rejuvenation-reduced-to-papers-garbage-dumping-continues-unabated-along-the-river/articleshow/84276661.cms||---

It was seized for being used in bootlegging and 120 beer bottles hidden in four bags was found in it. Two persons, Nikhil and Vishal Patel were arrested and booked under the Gujarat Prohibition Act. The seized ambulance was kept at the Pardi police station as muddamal (seized goods) and the hospital lost its ambulance to police custody. On Thursday, after nearly three months from its seizure, the Gujarat high court ordered the police to release the emergency vehicle on multiple conditions, including one which requires that the Directorate of Medical & Health Services “shall not use this vehicle in transporting liquor in future.” The Directorate of Medical & Health Services, which is the registered owner of the ambulance that was gifted to the Daman hospital by a former member of Parliament, approached the high court to get back the vehicle. The lower courts refused to release the ambulance because of the huge quantity of liquor recovered in this case. The medical authority contended that if the ambulance is not released, it would ultimately be reduced to scrap and the campuses of police stations have been reduced to scrapyards only. The state government strongly objected to the request and expressed apprehension that if released, there is a possibility that the petitioner will use the ambulance for transporting liquor. After hearing the case, Justice Vipul Pancholi ordered release of the ambulance by imposing different conditions on the medical authority of Daman to ensure it is not used in bootlegging again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-releases-damans-bootlegger-ambulance/articleshow/84279043.cms||---

V Buvaneswari, 47, of Venkatachalapuram, is working as a temporary accountant in the district head office of the public health department. The armed robber threatened to murder her and demanded Rs 10,000 for his sister’s treatment. He snatched her mobile phone and made her hand over Rs 40,000 she had saved. He also took away the gold chain and a pair of earrings she was wearing. He latched the door from outside before fleeing. Buvaneswari called her neighbours and informed the police control room. The Subramaniapuram police were investigating the crime. Finger print experts were pressed into service. Man, 39 held for selling tobacco products to teens: Trichy city police seized a bundle of banned tobacco products and arrested a man for selling them to teenage boys in Trichy city on Thursday. The Gandhi market police arrested R Rajalingam, 39 of Pappakurichi at Kattur in Trichy on charges of selling the banned tobacco to children under the sections of IPC, Food Safety and Standards Act 2006, Juvenile Justice (care and protection) Act, 2015, Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), 2003. Police took action based on the complaint from R Thirugnanasambandham, 35, a fruit vendor from North Tharanallur in Trichy yesterday. The police acted on his complaint and arrested him. They also seized 190 packets of banned tobacco worth Rs 11,400. Trichy court remanded him in judicial custody.

---||India||Forces want Russian copters fast-tracked||NEW DELHI: With replacements for old Cheetah and Chetak helicopters still stuck in red-tape amid the continuing military confrontation with China, the armed forces are planning to approach the government to procure “a minimum inescapable quantity” of the already-selected Russian Kamov-226T choppers in a flyaway condition. Defence sources say the need to replace obsolete single-engine Cheetahs and Chetaks of the vintage of 1960s-1970s, which are dogged by a high crash rate and major serviceability problems, has become an “existential operational necessity” now. “Operational availability of Cheetahs/Chetaks along the northern borders with China as well as the Siachen Glacier-Saltoro Ridge region with Pakistan is down to just 50%. Technical life of older Cheetahs/Chetaks will begin expiring in 2023. New light utility helicopters (LUHs) are desperately required for reconnaissance as well as sustenance of troops in forward areas,” a source said. The Army, IAF and Navy have been demanding new LUHs for almost 20 years now, with their total requirement being 498 choppers. After the proposed procurement of 197 such choppers from abroad was scrapped twice, India had inked an inter-governmental agreement with Russia to acquire 200 twin-engine Kamov-226T choppers for Army (135) and IAF (65) in 2015. The first 60 were to come in a fly-away condition, with the other 140 to be manufactured by a joint venture between Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) and Rostec Corp/Russian Helicopters. “But the project is still stuck at the technical evaluation stage, primarily due to disagreements over the proportion of indigenous content. Russia is offering slightly lower indigenous content than what India wants,” said another source. A separate HAL project to build another 126 indigenous LUHs for Army and 61 for IAF has also been delayed for years. “The first six of these LUHs are now likely to be inducted in December 2022. There are still some technical issues with these LUHs, including problems with tail rotor systems in high-altitude areas,” he added. As for the Russian choppers, a single Ka-226T in flyaway condition will cost around $6 million. The per unit cost of the choppers to be made in India, in turn, will be close to $11 million due to associated costs of land acquisition, labour, technology transfers and the like. “Importing all the 200 choppers will force India to depend on Russia for spares and maintenance. So, a certain number of Ka-226Ts should be procured on a fast-track basis to bridge the gap till the indigenous LUHs of HAL can be inducted in large numbers,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/forces-want-russian-copters-fast-tracked/articleshow/84284444.cms||Rajat Pandit

Six other relatives of the family were also swept away, three of whom were later rescued, including a seven-year-old girl. Search is on for the three missing persons. Fifteen pilgrims of the same family from Agra had come to Ayodhya to offer prayers at Ramjanmabhoomi and take a holy dip in the Saryu. Ashok Goyal, a wholesaler of vegetables in Agra’s Shastripuram, had gone to Ayodhya on Thursday evening with his wife, four daughters, one of his sons-in-law, two sons and six grandchildren. Goyal had left behind one of his sons, Padmesh, who is handicapped. His two sons, who had accompanied him, are also in the wholesale business in Agra. Eyewitnesses said when some pilgrims tried to wade into the waters to take a dip, they slipped and fell into the river. With no barricading chains along the Saryu to aid bathers, other family members who jumped into the river to save their kin were also trapped in the strong current. Hearing their screams, residents swung into action and managed to rescue six of the family members. Soon, PAC jawans joined the rescue mission after the Ayodhya administration launched a massive search operation for the missing. “If trained lifeguards are deployed at the ghats, lives could have been saved,” said a local resident.The deceased included Goyal’s wife Raj Kumari (61), his sons, Lalit (40) and Pankaj (25), daughter Sita (35) and two granddaughters Shruti (20) and Drashti (4). Those who were rescued were — Goyal’s daughters Aarti (35) and Gauri (28) and granddaughter Dhairya (7). Three of their family members — Goyal’s daughter Julie (42), grandson Sarthak (16) and granddaughter Priyanshi (16) – are still missing.

He also directed divers, police and provincial armed constabulary (PAC) to conduct swift rescue operations. Chief medical superintendent, Ayodhya district hospital, Dr C N B Tripathi said, six bodies have reached the hospital and among them are two men, three women and a girl. Ayodhya district magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha said, “Fifteen members of a family from Agra district were taking bath at Guptaar Ghat when they slipped into the Saryu and were swept away by the strong current.

While the civic body was vaccinating only those who had missed their second dosage due date by weeks, the forward messages circulated on social media platforms resulted in the participation of those who are well ahead of their due date for the second dose. Over 3,000 people in Trichy district are estimated to be waiting for their second dosage of Covaxin for the past two weeks. Therefore, corporation had a plan to avoid crowding during the only camp held at the Kalaiarangam wedding hall, and made calls to only those awaiting the second dose to come and take the jab. However, social media platforms were abuzz with messages urging people to visit the vaccination centre if they need a second dose of Covaxin. The civic body had limited vaccines in hand with around 200 doses. “It is unclear who shared the information about vaccination camp. We are inquiring. We have warned those who shared the messages on social media platforms,” said a corporation source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/social-media-forwards-result-in-overcrowding-at-vaccination-camp/articleshow/84279057.cms||Deepak Karthik

Singh has sought time stating that he is unwell and advised for surgery. The ED will record the statement of dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze in jail on Saturday. After his removal from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in March, Singh wrote a letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray alleging that Deshmukh had asked Waze and two other officers to illegally collect Rs 100 crore from restaurant and bar owners in the city every month. The ED had recorded Waze’s statement earlier too. Then Waze had claimed that he had collected Rs 4.7 crore between December 2020 and February 2021 and handed it over to Deshmukh’s personal assistant Kundan Shinde. The money was then allegedly routed with the help of Delhi-based hawala operators and transferred into Deshmukh’s trust in Nagpur as a donation. Last month, the ED had arrested Shinde and Deshmukh’s private secretary Sanjeev Palade, also an additional collector rank government officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-summons-param-bir-in-money-laundering-case/articleshow/84283085.cms||Vijay V Singh

For Saturday, the IMD has forecast heavy rains at isolated places in city and adjoining areas. The IMD said isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely over Maharashtra between July 9 and 13, while extremely heavy rainfall is also likely over ghat areas of Madhya Maharashtra on July 12 and 13. Meanwhile on Friday, even though the nine hours ending 5.30pm saw meager rain activity in the city, significant rainfall was recorded in the city between July 8-9 (8.30am-8.30am) with the IMD Santacruz observatory recording 72mm of rain which falls in the heavy rain category as per IMD classification (heavy rainfall: 64.5mm-115.5mm). The total rains recorded since June 1 by the Colaba observatory is 756mm and Santacruz observatory is 1061.3mm which is 51.3mm below normal and 278.4mm above normal, respectively. Meanwhile, the active monsoon spell needs to bring in some cheer for the lakes supplying water to Mumbai as they currently have total water stock of 2.61 lakh million litres or 18% of the total required stocks. Last year, the total stock on the same date was around 2.89 lakh million litres or 19.98% of the required stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/3-day-orange-alert-issued-for-mumbai-thane-and-raigad/articleshow/84286746.cms||Richa Pinto

The preprint of the research has been published recently. ‘We analyzed four samples to detect key mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and track circulating variants in Ahmedabad during the first wave (Sep/ Nov 2020) and before the second wave (in Feb 2021) of Covid-19 in India. The analysis showed a total of 35 mutations in the spike protein across four samples categorized into 23 types. We noticed the presence of spike protein mutations linked to the B.1.617.2 lineage (Delta variant) with 57% frequency in wastewater samples of Feb 2021,’ mentioned the paper. The researchers claimed that a continuous monitoring of wastewater of a specific geographic area can give a better picture of dominant variants, transmission and epidemiology of Covid-19. ‘It is worth noting that mutations which define the Delta variant were completely absent in samples during the first wave but appeared in the wastewater samples later,’ mentioned the conclusion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/study-detected-delta-strain-before-1st-case/articleshow/84279062.cms||---

On Wednesday, Aslali police filed a complaint saying that four GRD jawans attended duty after obtaining forged identity cards and khaki uniforms. The four fake GRD jawans caught at Aslali police station were identified as Sunil Parmar, 27, Vishal Parmar, 22, Hardik Parmar, 24, and Mahesh Parmar — all residents of Vatva. Police officers said that three men identified as Jashwant Makwana, 25, a resident of Vivekanandnagar, Manish Prajapati, 30, a resident of Sanand and Amit Raval, 25, a resident of Vatva, had provided the identity cards to the four fake GRD jawans. Earlier, Aslali police had said the fake GRD jawans had worked for the police for around a month. After inquiring into the case, inspector R R Jadeja of Aslali police said that they had worked at the police station for around 12 to 14 days only and had not been given any remuneration. “Apart from the four fake GRD jawans who were booked by Aslali police, there were 13 others who were sold identity cards and uniforms by Prajapati, Raval and Makwana. These 13 persons, during the course of inquiry, will be called and questioned about this case,” said Jadeja. The case came to light when the fake GRD jawans’ identity card numbers clashed with those of other jawans. After this it was discovered that their identity cards were forged. The accused were booked under charges of forgery and cheating and investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/17-men-had-fake-grd-jawan-cards/articleshow/84279096.cms||---

He said that the complainant woman is working at the behest of the Congress party. “On Thursday, the complainant attended a Congress party event, making her affiliation pretty clear. The Congress party is aware of the development works that I have undertaken in my constituency and has no standing in the upcoming polls. Thus, they have resorted to such sinister methods,” said Negi in a press conference on Friday. The legislator even said that his life is in danger. “They (Congress workers) have formed a gang. I fear that they will make attempts to kill me or harm my family before the 2022 elections. They can also come up with a doctored video to defame me.” He further said, “The Congress workers have said that they will ensure justice for the woman if the court doesn’t rule in her favour. This means that they have no faith in the judiciary and that they are planning to come after me when the court dismisses their case.” Negi also said that he is ready to undertake a DNA test to prove his innocence. Meanwhile, MLA also called the rape accusation against him baseless and questioned the character of the complainant woman. He produced nearly two dozen photos of the complainant with different men and accused her of being a professional ‘blackmailer’. “She has been trying to extort money from me from day 1,” added MLA Negi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/complainant-working-at-the-behest-of-congress-ready-to-take-dna-test-rape-accused-bjp-mla-mahesh-negi/articleshow/84276826.cms||---

Police said the man, Manish Kaul, was wanted since 2019 when he had escaped from Delhi Police’s custody in Mumbai. He was found running a clinic, impersonating a doctor. Shibesh Singh, ACP (Crime) said his team was tipped off about Kaul’s presence in Uttar Pradesh. “With the help of technical surveillance, we further narrowed down our search to Shastri Nagar in Meerut. However, despite our best efforts, the team was unable to track down his accurate location. On July 9, when Kaul ordered food online, his location was tracked and he was arrested from a nursing home in Shastri Nagar,” the officer said. During interrogation, Kaul revealed that his father ran a medicine factory in Ambala Cantt. He completed his bachelor’s in Unani and homeopathic in 2006 from a college in Jalandhar, Punjab and married two women, one of them by impersonating an MBBS doctor, police said. On November 27, 2019, Kaul had escaped from police custody of 3rd Battalion DAP at Vasai Police Station, Mumbai, while he was being brought back after production in various courts at Ernakulum (Kerala), Panji and Mapusa. In November 2014, he created a profile at Jeevansathi.com claiming to be an MD, MBBS doctor (unmarried) working as physician in a hospital in Sangrur, Punjab.  “A doctor from Ashok Vihar, Delhi, contacted him through the portal. They got married on July 20, 2015, in Chhatarpur. A son was born out of this wedlock. However, his wife soon found out about his activities and got a case registered against him. He had then reached her clinic with a loaded pistol to kill her. However, she called police. He tried to flee, but was arrested for attempt to murder in Kirti Nagar,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-poses-as-doc-to-dupe-women-held/articleshow/84304256.cms||---

At a core committee meeting chaired by chief minister Vijay Rupani, a decision has been taken to allow Class 12 students in schools and colleges across the state from July 15 with classes held at only 50% of the total student strength, said state government sources. Attendance will not be mandatory and schools, colleges are to take permission from parents in writing for allowing their children to attend classes, sources added. Bharat Gajipara, president of Gujarat Rajya School Management Association, while welcoming the government’s decision, said it should not be limited to Class 12 students only. “When the government has allowed coaching classed to reopen for Class 9 to Class 12 students, why a similar decision has not been taken for reopening of schools?” Gajipara asked. Others present at the core committee meeting included education minister Bhupindersinh Chudasama, chief secretary Anil Mukim, additional chief secretary for home department Pankaj Kumar, principal secretary for education S J Haider, secretary to CM Ashwani Kumar and education secretary Vinod Rao. “The government of Gujarat’s decision to begin in-person classes in schools for Class 12 students is an encouraging sign of a gradual return to normalcy. We are ready to welcome students with the due consent of their parents and Covid safety protocols. We will wait for detailed guidelines on school reopening from the state govt,” said Surender Sachdeva, principal, DPS Bopal. The government aims to reopen schools and colleges in a staggered manner with all social distancing measures and Covid-19 precautions in place. Many students of 18 years and above are yet to be vaccinated and reopening of colleges across the state, even with half the student strength on campus, remains a concern for some. “We will ask colleges to reopen from July 15 onwards once we get a government directive for the same,” said Himanshu Pandya, vice-chancellor, Gujarat University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/colleges-and-class-12-in-schools-to-reopen-in-state-from-july-15/articleshow/84279071.cms||---

A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi was hearing a public interest litigation filed by Soma Sankar, president of the Tamil Nadu Typewriting- Shorthand- Computer Institutes Sangam, based at Srivilliputhur in Virudhunagar district. The petitioner stated that various approved institutes are conducting classes for the shorthand high speed exam across the state. However, the exam conducted by the technical education department is only conducted at the State Institute of Commerce Education at Taramani in Chennai. Since the exams is conducted only at one centre in the state, candidates from the southern districts are facing difficulties as they have to travel all the way to Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-in-hc-to-open-centres-for-shorthand-examination/articleshow/84279100.cms||---
---||Madurai||Don’t divulge info under RTI in early stage of a project: Madras high court||MADURAI: Expressing surprise at the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for providing a RTI reply to a project report that was under preparation, which eventually stalled the land acquisition proceedings for a highway project in Kanyakumari district, the Madras high court has made it clear that the NHAI should not provide any information to anyone under the RTI Act till the project is approved by the central government. Dismissing a batch of petitions challenging the land acquisition proceedings for a stretch of 1.5km in the district, justice N Anand Venkatesh observed that the land acquisition proceedings of a small extent has been stalled for the last five years due to the pendency of these petitions, while the central government has completed a major portion by spending a huge amount of Rs 1,300 crore. The judge observed that by relying on the RTI reply of NHAI, the petitioners are raising the ground of legal malice by claiming that originally, there was an approved alignment which subsequently was altered to suit the needs of a church and based on the pressure that was exerted by an MLA. “If information is provided, in the manner in which it has happened in the present case, obviously, the acquisition proceedings will be stalled and persons will start knocking the doors of this court even before the notification is published. It is therefore made very clear that NHAI should not be divulging information when the project is at the preparatory stage,” observed the judge. The judge observed that just because the MLA had forwarded the representation of the church to the NHAI, it does not automatically result in an assumption that there was a political pressure to change the alignment. The judge said that there is a guiding principle where the project must attempt to steer clear of obstructions such as ‘places of worship’. Therefore, it is not unnatural or extraordinary when NHAI considered the request made by the church. The judge observed that the second ground raised by the petitioners was that of Principle of Promissory Estoppel which states that the party who made the promise will not be permitted to go back on it to the detriment of the other. The petitioners were only getting information when the project was at its preparatory stage. The judge observed that till date of approval of the project, there was no promise made to the petitioners that the alignment is going to happen only in a particular way. In fact, the alignment gets confirmed only after the notification is issued by the central government. Admittedly, there was no re-alignment after the publication of the notification and hence, there is no question of applying the Principles of Promissory Estoppel. Hence, the judge dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dont-divulge-info-under-rti-in-early-stage-of-a-project-hc/articleshow/84279085.cms||Kaushik Kannan

A communication to this effect has been jointly issued by ZP CEO Mangesh Gondawle and district collector Sunil Chavan. There are 1,369 villages in Aurangabad district. In the initial weeks, classes will be held for limited hours — around 3-4 hours daily — without a lunch break. Though the schools will have drinking water arrangements, students will be advised to get their own water bottles. Nitin Untwal, a parent who was relieved at the decision, told TOI, “Students from the rural and remote areas have suffered the most due to the lockdown as many did not have Android mobile phones to attend online classes. Besides, poor internet connectivity is common in villages. We welcome the move to reopen schools.” Anna Patil, sarpanch of a village, said efforts were continuing to check the further spread of Covid. “Students missed a lot during the pandemic. We want them to resume classes at the earliest, else they will completely lose track of studies,” he said. Gondawle told TOI, “Every Covid-free village will have a seven-member committee, comprising of the sarpanch, talathi, head of school management committee, health officer, gramsevak, headmaster or principal and centre head of the school. The committee will take a final decision on reopening schools.” Gondawle said that as per norms, the committee will first have to check that the village has had no Covid cases for at least the past 30 days. Next, the committee will discuss the reopening of schools with villagers and parents. Chavan said, “The committee will then have to send a proposal for reopening schools to the block development officer. The committee will also be responsible for ensuring that all teaching and non-teaching staff are vaccinated and have also undergone RT-PCR screening before resuming classes.” On getting the clearance to reopen schools, the committees will run a sustained campaign, ‘Back to School’, so that every student who has missed physical classes as well as formal education in the past 18 months returns to school. The committee will ensure availability of thermal screening devices, sanitizers, masks and soaps for hand wash in schools. Chavan said a list of directives related to cleanliness, personal hygiene and social distancing are expected to be followed at each school. To begin with, only a limited number of students will be permitted in each classroom.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/901-covid-free-villages-in-aurangabad-dist-to-reopen-schools-from-july-15/articleshow/84281294.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The BMC, though, has said the annual fees pending since 2014 will be restropectively recovered only from builders and not residents. Housing societies will have to pay the annual fees from July 2021 every year, which will be added to their property tax. “The fire service fee is recovered at the time the building is given approval. So, this fee will be recovered from builders and there will be no burden on the common citizen. This will be taken into consideration and this fee will be charged as per the minimum fees prescribed in law and there is no hike proposed on this amount,” the fire brigade said in a written reply to the civic standing committee. Last week, the BMC standing committee was adjourned over the BMC move to recover fire service fees and annual fees from builders and housing societies. Corporators had termed the move as unfair and asked the civic administration to stay the recovery process. The adjournment motion was moved by Shiv Sena corporator Vishakha Raut. While the one-time fire service fee is around Rs 15 per square metre, the annual fee is 1% of the fire service fee. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said, “This is a Rs 5,000 crore scam. The circular was to be scrapped, which hasn’t been done. Builders will ultimately pass on the cost to residents. The municipal commissioner is not fixing the responsibility on fire brigade officials. There must be a probe by the central vigilance commission (CVC) and an FIR must be filed with the economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai police.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-despite-civic-panel-directive-bmc-to-recover-fire-service-fees-from-builders-annual-from-residents/articleshow/84279748.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Hyderabad||A Revanth Reddy eyes lost glory in Greater Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Having been pushed to the corner by the ruling TRS and a resurgent BJP, the new look Telangana Congress led by A Revanth Reddy wants to regain the lost ground in Greater Hyderabad. Of the total 150 seats in GHMC, Congress could manage to win only two in the elections held to the civic body in December 2020. Congress salvaged some pride by defeating the BJP in Lingojiguda ward bypoll, taking its tally in the GHMC council to three seats. In the 2018 assembly polls, Congress had failed to win even a single seat from the 14 assembly seats in Hyderabad and Secunderabad Lok Sabha constituencies. While the TRS swept a majority of 24 assembly segments in Greater Hyderabad and the AIMIM won seven seats. Congress candidate D Sudheer Reddy managed to win LB Nagar seat falling under Malkajgiri Lok Sabha constituency, but later defected to the TRS. Given the infighting in the Congress, the think-tank of the new team has suggested a few strategies to revive the electoral prospects of the party. The first of the strategies is to divide the city into four zones based on the number of GHMC wards and assembly constituencies located in each of the four parliamentary constituencies of Hyderabad, Secunderabad, Malkjagiri and Chevella. Revanth Reddy confirmed to TOI that they will soon take a decision after consultations with all the stakeholders to ensure that Congress emerges as a force to reckon with again in Greater Hyderabad. There is a proposal to appoint a team of young and senior leaders comprising working presidents, vice-presidents, district and mandal presidents, former MPs, MLAs, MLCs and ex-ministers and give them the responsibility of reviving the party in each ward, assembly segment and parliamentary constituency as a whole, a party leader said. Among other options is appointing separate city presidents for twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, Rangareddy and Medchal Malkajgiri districts who will work under a high-level team comprising seniors for each assembly constituency. The city Congress president post is lying vacant now as Anjan Kumar Yadav, who was holding the post, has been elevated as the working president of the state Congress. Revanth Reddy-led team is now looking out for a strong leader from the city to take on the TRS, BJP and AIMIM. “It is not going to be an easy task. Congress had won 14 seats in Greater Hyderabad in 2009 assembly polls but there after it’s been a downhill. The big brains in the new team have suggested strategies to put the party back on track,” said a leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revanth-eyes-lost-glory-in-greater-hyderabad/articleshow/84279105.cms||Roushan Ali

While it was speculated that he would probably be given the TRS ticket to contest from the Huzurabad assembly seat by-election or accommodated with an MLC seat, Ramana said he did not set any pre-conditions for joining the TRS. He met chief minister and TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao at Pragati Bhavan on Thursday night. He was accompanied by panchayat raj minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao. Ramana said when he met KCR no offers were made. Ramana also met with his supporters and said he would formally join the TRS only with the motive and intention of contributing to the development of the state. “For nearly one-and-a-half hours, we discussed various welfare and developmental activities that have been undertaken in the last seven-year rule of the TRS. I told the CM that I would consider positively his invitation to join the TRS,” Ramana told reporters. Ramana announced his resignation from N Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP with which he had been associated for nearly three decades. “In the changed scenario and with an intention to serve the people better, I have decided to join the TRS,” he said in a short letter in Telugu to Naidu. He made the letter public on Friday by sharing it on his social media account. Ramana thanked Naidu for helping him grow in the last three decades in the TDP. KCR’s efforts to get Ramana into TRS fold was also dictated by the desire to see that former health minister Eatala Rajender would suffer a defeat at the hustings. A by-election is due in Huzurabad as Eatala quit the TRS and joined the BJP. During his long political career, Ramana was an MP from Karimnagar. He was also elected as an MLA from Jagtial and served as a textiles minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/l-ramana-bids-adieu-to-tdp-to-join-ruling-trs/articleshow/84279155.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Reacting to KTR’s barb of new beggars and that it should be Telugu Desam Party Congress Committee (TDPCC) instead of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee in the backdrop of Revanth Reddy coming from TDP, Revanth said KTR should study history before making comments. “If I am from TDP, what is KCR, KTR and TRS? K Chandrasekhar Rao was a minister and deputy speaker in TDP. He was a team member of NTR and N Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP governments. Presently, 10 ministers in KCR cabinet are from TDP.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Sanjay Gandhi centre for animals to shut temporarily||NEW DELHI: After 40 years of operation, Sanjay Gandhi Animal Care Centre (SGACC) in west Delhi will be shut temporarily from August 1, former Union minister Maneka Gandhi said on Saturday. The move comes following an incident of animal cruelty that occurred on the shelter’s premises, where two newly hired para-vets were allegedly seen thrashing a dog, resulting in its death. Gandhi in a statement, said there would be complete overhaul of the management, with new staff to be provided animal-sensitive training before it was reopened. There will also be a new infrastructure in place for the animals, she added. The video of the dog being assaulted went viral on July 5, leading to animal activists questioning the treatment being meted out to animals at the shelter. Gandhi said, over the last one year, SGACC had been short-staffed due to Covid-19 and two newly hired para-vets were tending to the dog in this case. She said the dog was in pain and naturally agitated — biting one of the para-vets, who in turn, retaliated with frightful violence, resulting in its death. “This incident has shocked us all to the core. I have been seething with rage and have been sick to my stomach since I watched the horrifying video. We immediately filed an FIR against the para-vets, and they have been arrested. The doctor-in charge of the section has been given a notice to leave,” said Gandhi. She added that SGACC had faltered in its mission to provide care to animals and needed to be rebuilt. “ It will be closed to any future rescues, and existing animals will be rehabilitated. We will rebuild this institution again – physically, and more importantly, in terms of staffing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sanjay-gandhi-centre-for-animals-to-shut-temporarily/articleshow/84304301.cms||---

Talking to party workers on Friday, he said that the chief minister is now nervous about BJP’s growth in the state and is therefore going on district tours. “For the sake of corruption, he is allowing Andhra Pradesh to take water from Krishna and allowing them to build projects. KCR had gone to YSRCP MLA Roja’s house and since then the water dispute drama began,” he alleged. Expressing confidence that the BJP will come to power in 2023, he said the BJP will not have any tie-up with any party during elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-creating-issues-in-water-sharing-bandi/articleshow/84279161.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Plastic rice’ found to be fortified pellets||AHMEDABAD: From Mangrol near Surat and Panchmahal district, the Food Research Laboratory (FRL) of the directorate of forensic sciences (DFS) received rice samples which were suspected to be ‘plastic rice’. In a report submitted to the state public distribution system (PDS) department, FRL experts said the said rice grains were fortified pellets that are mixed with rice distributed by the PDS. “The said grains were subjected to several tests including burning, dissolution in water and chemical reaction. The said grains burned easily without odour, dissolved in water and were not giving chemical reactions normal for plastic substances. Thus, they were found to be organic,” said a senior FRL official. DFS officials said that their subsequent investigation revealed that the pellets are composed of flour fortified with vitamins and minerals. These are specifically distributed in districts with malnutrition issues. “Every 100 grains have one such pellet, made in the shape of a rice grain. It is safe to consume and has no adverse health implication,” said an official. Sources privy to the developments said an awareness campaign will be planned around the issue so people can identify fortified rice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/plastic-rice-found-to-be-fortified-pellets/articleshow/84279206.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Do not take coercive steps against ex-MP Butta Renuka: Telangana HC to Hyderabad police||HYDERABAD: Justice Shameem Akther of the Telangana high court on Friday directed the Hyderabad police not to take any coercive steps against former Kurnool MP Butta Renuka in an FIR registered against her at Madhapur police station. The judge gave this interim direction after hearing the petition filed by Renuka challenging the action of the police in making her an accused in the case. The police made her one of the accused after registering a complaint lodged by one Boyapati Mahender Reddy, treasurer of St. Mary’s Educational Society, Hyderabad. The grievance of the St Mary’s society is that though the former MP and her husband entered into a sale agreement to sell their Meridian educational group land at Kukatpalli worth Rs 40 crore to the society and even took Rs 6.5 crore as an advance in 2018, they failed to register the land in favour of the society in the last three years and did not refund the advance. Appearing for Renuka, her counsel N Niyata said that the former MP’s husband is working with Meridian group as its secretary. “The sale agreement too was done between the St Mary’s society and the Meridian group. Her husband may have been a signatory to the agreement because he is its secretary. The complainant and the police have purposefully made Renuka an accused though she was not a signatory to the agreement. This was done only to bring pressure on her husband,” Niyata said. The judge invited counter from the police and directed them not to take any coercive steps against Renuka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/do-not-take-coercive-steps-against-ex-mp-hc-to-cops/articleshow/84279190.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Caste equations may take centre stage||Hyderabad: With L Ramana joining the ruling TRS, caste equations are expected to take centre stage in Huzurabad bypoll. The assembly segment has about 30,000 Padmashali votes, represented by L Ramana. It is anticipated that the TRS is most likely to make use of him for garnering the votes from this community. The TRS has reportedly begun approaching the voters caste-wise. In Huzurabad, land parcels are being allotted to caste associations. “It is hoped that with the joining of Ramana, his personal association with the community and understanding of local politics will help in strengthening ties with his community,” a TRS leader said. Former health minister Eatala Rajender belongs to the Mudiraj community and is supposedly having a good hold over BCs as he also hails from the same community. L Ramana’s Padmashali (weavers) community also comes under BC community. Ramana also worked as minister for handlooms and textiles between 1994 and 1996 during the TDP regime in undivided AP. The TDP being known as BCs’ party had retained him as the TTDP president for seven years despite TTDP leaders urging TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu to change the guard in the state. They alleged that Ramana was not aggressive. However, the same BC card has helped Ramana in attracting the TRS. While there has been speculation that L Ramana may contest in Huzurabad bypoll, sources close to him denied any such possibility. “He was promised a good role along with his followers, he always had a good rapport with TRS leaders like Errabelli Dayakar Rao,” sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/caste-equations-may-take-centre-stage/articleshow/84279176.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The criminals were targeting a property dealer, who had managed to escape. Police said the property dealer’s nephew had complained against an unauthorised construction in Sadar Bazar, after which the court had put a stay on the construction. The main conspirator is stated to be a close aide of the family and raids are going on to nab him. The incident happened around 9pm and the PCR received a call around 9.21pm. Property dealer Mohammad Naeem, who had a narrow escape, was at his brother’s nursing home — Sanjida Hospital, which is under renovation. Naeem told police that a man in a black T-shirt tried to enter the hospital, but was asked to leave. A few minutes later, Naeem left with his nephew Munim and office boy Prakash and the same man tried to accost him. There was a scuffle, and the man left to return with two associates. The men then started shooting at Naeem, but the stray bullets killed two passersby. Speaking to TOI, Munim said, “We were shown pictures of some of the suspects by the cops, who are investigating the matter. The Sadar Bazar land is owned by a man called Danish, whom I suspect to be behind the attack. After the stay order by court, our family, including me and my uncle, got threat calls”. While the identity of one of the deceased was established as Sanjay Kumar (25), the identity of the other is yet to be ascertained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/property-firing-4-detained-police-hunt-for-close-aide/articleshow/84304354.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Tainted’ Police Complaint Authority member sacked||MUMBAI: The home department led by NCP leader Dilip Walse Patil has sacked Police Complaint Authority (PCA) member Rajkumar Bhungrao Dhakne in the wake of an adverse report submitted by then director general of police Subodh Jaiswal in August last year. In a report on August 12, 2020, TOI had written about the pending criminal cases against Dhakne, and also reported about the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation terminating the toll contract to a firm controlled by Dhakne following his appointment to the PCA. As per rules, a public servant is barred from securing a contract for toll collection. MSRDC’s contention was Dhakne came under the purview of public servant following his appointment as a PCA member. Following a Supreme Court verdict, the PCA was set up on May 15, 2015, to examine complaints against police personnel. The PCA is headed by a retired HC judge, while its members are in the rank of principal secretary. While Dhakne was appointed PCA member on July 14, 2020 in the category of eminent members of civil society, on July 5, 2021, principal secretary (home) Sanjay Saxena issued a notification on his termination. “The director general of police has submitted to the government that serious criminal cases are pending against Dhakne. Considering the DGP’s report, the government has come to the conclusion that it will be appropriate to terminate the membership of Dhakne. Accordingly, as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Police Rules, the government is terminating the membership of PCA,” Saxena said in his one-page order. In his report submitted to the government on August 26, 2020, Jaiswal had stated in view of Dhakne’s criminal background, the cases pending against him and the fact that he had escaped when he was under detention, he should not be appointed to the PCA. The report further said his appointment would have a demoralising effect on police officials and would damage the authority’s image. Jaiswal had said three cases were pending before the courts. The first pertained to an offence registered at Pune airport police station for organising an illegal procession, the second pertained to an attack on a security guard at Ruby Hall Clinic in Pune. In the third case, he was booked for escaping from police detention. Following the TOI report, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis had demanded that Dhakne must be sacked forthwith. “It was wrong to appoint persons like Dhakne in organisations like the PCA,” Fadnavis said. Rajkumar Dhakne did not respond to calls and messages from TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tainted-police-complaint-authority-member-sacked/articleshow/84284017.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Hyderabad||Hetero Group seeks Molnupiravir EUA||Hyderabad: Hetero Group has approached the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for emergency use authorisation (EUA) for investigational new drug Molnupiravir after a Phase-III clinical trial it conducted showed fewer hospital admissions and quicker recovery. Hetero said its Phase-III trial demonstrated statistically significant fewer hospital admissions, faster time to clinical improvement and early negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR with Molnupiravir treatment in mild Covid-19 patients. The interim results showed the median time to clinical improvement was as early as eight days in patients given Molnupiravir along with standard of care (SOC) as compared to 12 days in those on SOC alone. The company also said all adverse events were non-serious, mild in severity, and none led to drug discontinuation. “Most common adverse events reported were nausea, diarrhoea and headache which were resolved completely,” Hetero said. The multi-centre trial was conducted on 1,218 mild Covid-19 patients. The participants were randomised to receive either Hetero’s Molnupiravir capsules 800 mg (4 x 200 mg) every 12 hours (twice daily) for five days along with SOC as per Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines or, in the control arm, to receive SOC alone. The company said it will also be undertaking a separate study on moderate Covid-19 patients as approved by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation. An oral form of a potent ribonucleoside analog, Molnupiravir inhibits replication of multiple RNA viruses, with demonstrated activity against SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cell cultures and potential to eliminate the virus from the body within five days, it said. Its developer Merck Sharp & Dohme entered into non-exclusive licencing deals with Hetero as well as other companies for manufacture and supply of Molnupiravir in India and over 100 low and middle-income countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hetero-group-seeks-molnupiravir-eua/articleshow/84279193.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Madurai||Vaigai water quality alarming: Study||MADURAI: The Centre for Urban Resources of Dhan Foundation, (CURE), which sampled Vaigai river water, has found it to be extremely polluted with the parameters indicating that it is a dying river. It said the smart city programme has been isolating the river from its community and there is an urgent need to reactivate Vaigai River Rejuvenation Trust founded four years ago. CURE programme leader N Venkatesan said they had sampled the water at nine critical points of Madurai corporation limits and compared it with the quality standards of Central Pollution Control Board. According to the board, drinking water sources need to fulfil certain criteria. Total Coliform Organism in MPN/100ml should be 50 or less, pH between 6.5 and 8.5 and Dissolved Oxygen 6mg/l or more. He said they found that eight out of nine samples were not fit for use. The physical, chemical and biological parameters are distressing. River Vaigai is completely alkaline in nature with the result in the third check dam (Ismaiylpuram check dam) showing presence of ammonia, which is a high level of degradation indicator. The biological parameter determines the health of the river with oxygen being the well-established indicator of water quality. Dissolved oxygen (DO) is essential for the survival of all aquatic organisms. Moreover, oxygen affects other water indicators, not only biochemical but aesthetic like odour, clarity and taste. Vaigai’s DO varies from 1-4 mg/L. If DO is zero then the river is technically regarded as dead. The Biological Oxygen Demand( BOD) indicates contamination. In Vaigai, the result varies from 30-120 mg/L with Pathalkudi Channel contributing the maximum contamination. Recently, Madurai corporation installed a 2 MLD sewage treatment plant to treat the channel which is about to be commissioned. Apart from these, faecal contamination is very high throughout the river at a level indicated as TNTC (too numerous to count). Venkatesan says the degradation of the river has happened because community ownership is restricted and now the retaining walls being constructed on both banks are adding to the disaster. Restricting sewage and solid waste into the river is the only way to safeguard the non-perennial river. The foundation said this is possible through collective action with individual responsibility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vaigai-water-quality-alarming-study/articleshow/84279228.cms||---

The official said that the fare hike may be effected in all buses across Maharashtra, including semi-luxury, AC Shiv Shahi and Shivneris, which ply from Mumbai to Pune. A proposal for fare hike could be submitted before the MSRTC board soon, which will seek state transport clearance before announcing the hikes. “Diesel is an important component in our operational costs as the majority of buses in our 18,000-strong fleet ply on this fuel,” said another official from Mumbai Central headquarters. The diesel price has been escalating with over 100 hikes witnessed in the past 15 months and is nearing the century mark in Maharashtra.

---||Delhi||Covid violations: Two Karol Bagh markets closed for two days||NEW DELHI: Gaffar Market and Naiwala Market have been ordered to remain closed from 10pm on July 9 till 10pm on July 11 as Covid-appropriate behaviour was not being followed in both places. In the order issued on Friday by Karol Bagh sub-divisional magistrate Balram Meena, it was stated that the market associations had failed to ensure compliance to Covid-19 norms, which is why it was necessary to take stringent action. “The Karol Bagh executive magistrate’s report mentioned that shopkeepers, vendors and the general public at Gaffar Market and Naiwala were not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Due to huge footfall, market associations and shopkeepers were not able to ensure Covid protocols in the last three days. The situation may become the cause of super spreading of Covid-19,” the order added. Stating that it was important to take immediate and stringent action to curtail the spread of the virus, the order further mentioned, “In public interest, both the markets are restricted to open with effect from 10pm on July 9 till 10pm on July 11. Karol Bagh ACP is directed to sanitise the market and market associations should extend all cooperation.” In another development, the north district administration issued directions for closure of the DDA market in Sector 13, Rohini till July 12 for gross violation of norms, including by the shopkeepers, and extreme congestion. The order issued by the Alipur SDM stated that additional DCP (Rohini) conducted a surprise inspection and found gross violation of norms as a large number of shopkeepers and visitors were not wearing masks, no social distancing was being followed and the market was extremely crowded. The market association of Sector 13, Rohini has been directed to submit a clarification and detailed plan as to how Covid-appropriate behaviour would be ensured after which it would be allowed to open based on DDMA guidelines. On Friday, a notice was also issued to Avantika Market in Rohini Sector 2 to strictly abide by the norms to avoid closure. Prior to these markets, Laxmi Nagar, Gandhi Nagar (12 shops), Nangloi, Rui Market and Lajpat Nagar markets were closed in the past one week for flouting norms. The traders argued that shopkeepers and market associations alone could not be held responsible for violations in public places. Chamber of Trade and Industry Delhi convener Brijesh Goyal said that traders would meet the district magistrates concerned on Saturday. “If the rules are being violated in any market, then the responsibility of compliance and enforcement lies with police and the civic bodies. If a crowd is seen in any market, the administration should meet the market associations first and work out ways to improve the situation rather than closing it,” Goyal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-karol-bagh-mkts-closed-for-2-days/articleshow/84277024.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||HC: No stay in ED case against India Cements MD||Hyderabad: Justice Shameem Akther of the Telangana high court on Friday refused to stay the money laundering case booked by the Enforcement Directorate against India Cements MD N Srinivasan in connection with his investments in Jagathi publications and other firms. The ED booked its case against India Cements and its MD after CBI registered a case against them in the quid pro quo case. The allegation against Srinivasan is that he was given additional water allocation for his factory in Ranga Reddy district. The case of the CBI is that the state under the YS Rajasekhara Reddy regime made a huge allocation of water from Kagna and Krishna rivers by crossing the norms. In lieu of this benefit, Srinivasan invested heavily in the firms of YSR’s son, the CBI alleges. It says that though Srinivasan was showing this as an investment, it was nothing but a bribe paid by him for the benefits he derived from the state assets. The journey of this alleged bribe money into Jagathi and other firms is the subject matter of the money-laundering probe by the ED. Appearing for Srinivasan, senior counsel T Niranjan Reddy urged the court to quash the ED case against Srinivasan. In fact, the high court has already quashed the CBI case against him. Courts have been quashing the ED cases after the main cases in them were quashed. “Since the CBI case against the MD in the current case was already quashed six years ago, the ED case also deserves to be nullified because this is only an offshoot of the main CBI case,” Niranjan said. The judge refused to accord such relief and posted the case for two weeks. Appearing for Srinivasan, senior counsel T Niranjan Reddy urged the court to quash the ED case against Srinivasan.

Madishetty Srinivas was reunited with his family on July 8 in what came as a much relief to his wife Jamuna and family members after two years of agony. The case of Srinivas is peculiar in the sense that he could not even remember his wife’s telephone number when he was found living on a pavement in Dubai. A Telugu man who noticed a starving Srinivas made a video of him. Srinivas was identified by the family which got to see the video after it was shared by social worker Patkuri Basanth Reddy. Srinivas’s family was worried for him as he stopped calling them two years ago. They did not have any idea as to where he was and what he was doing in Dubai. But the video came as a relief as they hoped he would be helped to return to Karimnagar. The CGI took care of Srinivas and worked out formalities to send him back to India. Srinivas was left without a job in Dubai after an agent cheated him. The Covid-19 situation made his situation worse. With no money and no one to help, he started living on the road and became disoriented.

---||Hyderabad||T preventive detention law draconian, says SC||Dhananjay.Mahapatra New Delhi: The Supreme Court was on Friday surprised to find that grant of bail to an accused had no practical meaning in Telangana as the state police could invoke provisions of Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act to put a person under preventive detention for the same offences for which he had been granted bail by the court. “It is a draconian law clearly against the liberty of persons. It is surprising that no one has challenged the validity of the law,” said a bench of Justices R F Nariman, K M Joseph and B R Gavai on a petition by the wife of a detenu. Advocate Gaurav Agrawal told the court that the man, a stock trader, was accused of duping five people and five FIRs were registered. Agrawal said in all the five cases, the accused was granted bail, but soon after, the police put him under preventive detention under the provisions of Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Boot-leggers, Dacoits, Drug Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders (Land Grabbers, Spurious Seed Offenders, Insecticide Offenders, Fertiliser Offenders, Food Adulteration Offenders, Fake Document Offenders, Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, Gaming Offenders, Sexual Offenders, Explosive Substances Offenders, Arms Offenders, Cyber Crime Offenders and White Collar or Financial Offenders) Act, 1986. The bench issued notice to the Telangana government and sought its response within a week. Agrawal said the powers under preventive detention law should be sparingly used by the authorities only if the danger of commission of a crime is real and proximate as preventive detention is against the constitutional ethos supporting life and liberty of persons.  The designated authority in a whimsical manner exercised its powers under the PD Act to put the accused under detention immediately after he was ordered to be released, thus not only violating the right to liberty but also in brazen defiance of the bail orders of the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-preventive-detention-law-draconian-says-sc/articleshow/84281429.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

After the SC directed that by-polls for seats meant for OBC candidates should be filled with candidates from the open category, the SEC had said the by-polls in five zilla parishads and 33 municipal councils would be held on July 19. The state government had written twice to the SEC, in the last week of June and on July 7, requesting it to postpone the by-polls in view of the pandemic and the possible third wave.On Friday, the SEC said that in view of restrictions imposed out of apprehensions of a projected third wave and the fear of spread of the Delta-plus variant, the process of the local body by-polls would be stayed and would be taken further later taking into consideration the Covid situation. The SC had struck down the state’s amendment of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961, saying the OBC quota couldn’t result in crossing the overall 50% quota ceiling. “Further process will be announced after the Covid-19 situation improves,” said state election commissioner U P S Madan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sec-puts-off-local-body-bypolls-in-view-of-covid/articleshow/84284029.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

Sirsa was the secretary-general of the committee during the alleged incident and is currently its president. The court’s orders came after Bhupinder Singh, also a stakeholder in the funds received by DSGMC, moved the court claiming there was apprehension that Sirsa was in the process of fleeing from the country. Chief metropolitan magistrate Dr Pankaj Sharma said, “In view of the apprehension expressed on behalf of the complainant and for the interest of proper investigation, IO (investigating officer) must ensure the accused people do not flee from the course of justice.” Advocate Sanjay Abbot, appearing for the complainant, claimed that Sirsa had sold his properties and was in the process of fleeing as soon as the flight operations resumed. He added that police had not taken appropriate steps to prevent him from fleeing. Police had submitted before the court that the allegations of unjustified payments from Golak Funds to M/s Raja Tent & Decorators and other companies were being probed. The investigating officer said misappropriation of funds of the Gurdwara through bogus bills was also under probe. TOI contacted Sirsa for his reaction, but he did not comment on the court order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-directs-cops-to-ensure-sirsa-stays-in-country/articleshow/84304498.cms||Usha Das
---||Mumbai||Cops trace, save minor on edge after Rs 45L loss||Mumbai: Within two days of a teen disappearing from home here and posting an ominous down-and-out note on social media, Mumbai police’s crime branch tracked him down 60 km away and brought him back safely. It turned out the 17-year-old had borrowed Rs 45 lakh to start a business, but the venture failed and he lost it all. As creditors started hounding him, he slipped away and was contemplating a drastic step when the cops found him. The teen, who lives with his mother at her maternal home in Andheri (East) since his parents’ divorce, had dropped out of school. For the past year and a half, he had been trying to run a business selling Covid-related gear such as masks, sanitisers and PPE kits. On July 5, he did not return home which got his mother and grandparents worried. They called up all his friends before approaching the Sakinaka police the next day to lodge a missing complaint. The crime branch began a parallel probe as the case involved the disappearance of a minor. Meanwhile, a note surfaced on his Instagram account where the boy wrote that “he had been scammed”. He further wrote that he had made a big mistake and that his dead body would be found soon. The note ended with an apology. One of his friends alerted his mother about the note. The moment she told the crime branch about it, investigators gathered that the matter was serious. “The boy had switched off his phone. But he was accessing social media from someone else’s handset. He was not using this other handset to make or answer any calls, which made our job tough,” said an officer. The police roped in experts to find the location of this second phone. The handset belonged to one of his friends, who wasn’t aware the boy was using it. The location was Virar East, 60 km from the boy’s home. On July 7, a team headed by senior inspector Mahesh Thakur and assistant inspector Dhanraj Chaudhary took a train to Virar. After hunting for some time, they found the teen outside a Ganpati temple, looking crestfallen. After assuring him that things would be okay, investigators asked why he had left home. The boy replied that he had promised to repay his creditors with interest, once he made profits in his business. But he was never able to make any profit. The teen said he had grown up without a father and had frequent arguments with his mother. He said they lived in a small house and were forced to move homes often for lack of funds. He added that his grandparents loved him dearly and he was keen to make it big for their sake, but had ended up disappointing them. The police brought him back and counselled him before reuniting him with his mother. Clinical psychologist Narendra Kinger said when families break up, they should seek out professional counselling. “There should be no shame in taking help from a counsellor. In fact, by speaking to counsellors, parents can know what is actually going on in the child’s mind,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cops-trace-save-minor-on-edge-after-rs-45l-loss/articleshow/84283286.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Hyderabad||Sirisha Bandla: Knew I’d go to space, no matter what||Saurabh.Sinha New Delhi: The endless void had called out to Sirisha Bandla since the time she was a child growing up in Houston, the seat of America’s manned space programme. The Andhra-born girl knew then that one day she would head out to space, “no matter what”. On Sunday (July 11), her rocket-fuelled dreams will come true. Bandla (34) will be “Astronaut 004” on board Virgin Galactic’s space plane VSS Unity, flying to the edge of space at about three and a half times the speed of sound along with Virgin founder Richard Branson (Astronaut 001) and four others in a fully crewed 90-minute sub-orbital flight. “I feel like I am taking a bit of India up there with me,” she told TOI in an exclusive interaction from VG’s Spaceport America in New Mexico on Friday. If all goes as planned, Bandla (34), a Trekkie, will be only the second India-born woman to go to space, after Nasa astronaut Kalpana Chawla who lost her life in the space shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. The first Indian in space was the IAF’s Rakesh Sharma, who retired as a wing commander. Bandla’s flight role is "researcher experience". She is Virgin Galactic’s vice-president of government affairs and research operations. Bandla’s mother is bringing one of her favourite dishes, mutton biryani, to New Mexico before her daughter takes off to over 3 lakh feet above Earth. Her all-time favourite is the Andhra yellow dal dish pappu. When she returns, she plans to ask her mother to make it for her. "That’s my comfort food, hot rice and yellow lentils with some ghee. I, embarrassingly so, still can’t make it like her." Born in Andhra’s Chirala, Bandla’s parents left with her for the US when she was 4. "The love (for space) actually started when I lived in Houston, surrounded by Nasa. I started looking at how people became astronauts and I tried to model my career after them," Bandla said. Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma (retd) was a big influence. "…sometimes you just need to share an identity with someone to kind of reduce mental barriers… (I tell myself) that’s something I could do because someone from my background and my culture has done it as well," Bandla, an MBA who studied aerospace, aeronautical and astronautical engineering in 2011 at Purdue University, said. "I decided I was going to space no matter what. I didn’t know when it was going to happen, but I was pretty sure I would make it there some day. I credit that to my grandparents and my parents who have always encouraged me, pushed me to keep chasing my dream," Bandla, who dreams to make "safely go where no tourist has gone before" possible, said. "I hope I go to space many times and many others go there too," the India-born astronaut said. Besides Branson and her, the others on the spaceflight will be chief astronaut Beth Moses (Astronaut 002) and lead operations engineer Colin Bennett (Astronaut 003). Branson, who turns 72 on July 18, will "evaluate customer spaceflight experience". SS Unity will be flown by pilots Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci. The mothership VSS Eve (named for Branson’s mother), from which VSS Unity will drop when it reaches 50,000 feet, will be piloted by CJ Sturckow and Kelly Latimer. Unity’s rocket engines will then ignite and carry Branson, Bandla and the four others higher than 50 miles (360,890 feet/110,000 metres) at about 4,300 kmph. At the top of the arc, they will experience weightlessness for about four minutes before Unity re-enters the atmosphere and begins to glide back to Earth. Sunday’s space mission appears to be the result of a race between two billionaires — Branson and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — to get out there first. Both own companies that are pushing frontiers to offer space voyages to tourists. The Virgin Group founder will have made his flight nine days before Bezos when he lands on Sunday. Bezos is scheduled to lift off in his space travel company Blue Origin’s New Shepard on July 20, the 52nd anniversary of the first manned moon landing. Branson describes his own spaceflight as not a race but "an incredible, wonderful coincidence that we’re going up in the same month". Asked about Bezos’ July 20 flight, and then spaceflights by Musk’s SpaceX in coming months, Bandla said: "I know this sounds fluffy but I think the more the merrier. It’s actually absolutely incredible that so many companies are providing spaceflight… It’s not a (doing it) first thing for me. We're creating this industry. It’s really going to change the way we look at not only the planet, but what we can achieve in our lifetimes." At present, the about-90-minute commercial VG spaceflight, which will hopefully start next year, costs about $250,000. Virgin Galactic hopes this will fall to about $40,000 over time. Almost 600-700 tickets have been bought by future astro-tourists, a list that reportedly includes Tom Hanks, who starred in "Apollo 13".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sirisha-bandla-knew-id-go-to-space-no-matter-what/articleshow/84281480.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Telangana Mahila Congress president Sunitha Rao demanded that the TRS government immediately take back all the nurses into duty and enhance their wages. “Over 1,600 outsourced nurses in Telangana were terminated abruptly on July 6. The nurses began staging protests against the government’s decision. They were holding a demonstration in front of Gandhi Bhavan when the cops dragged and detained them. Some nurses even brokedown and fell on the feets of the cops,” said Sunitha Rao. The nurses had turned up at Gandhi Bhavan to meet the new TPCC chief Revanth Reddy from where they tried to take out a rally to the DME office in Koti. However, the police foiled the rally. “Instead of honouring the nurses who as frontline warriors have been saving hundreds of lives while risking their own life during the pandemic, the ruling TRS has unleashed police force to suppress their voice,” Sunitha Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/protesting-nurses-detained/articleshow/84279317.cms||---
---||Surat||Three Bangladeshi migrants held for murder||BHARUCH/SURAT: Three Bangladeshi nationals staying illegally in the country were arrested for murder by Bharuch local crime branch police on Friday. According to police, the trio killed a colleague who was threatening them of informing the police about their illegal presence here and of being deported back to their native country. “All four, including the one who was killed, are Bangladeshi nationals and had been staying in our country illegally from past many years. They kept changing their location from Ahmedabad to Surat and Ankleshwar,” said Rajendrasinh Chudasama, SP, Bharuch police. Deceased who was identified as Akbar, was staying near Chandola talav area of Ahmedabad, and had been allegedly threatening his three colleagues of informing the police and getting them deported to their country if they did not pay him ransom. Fed up of the constant threatening, the three decided to end the harassment and with the support of local auto-rickshaw driver Naushad Indris Khan, 34, a resident of Bapunagar in Ankleshwar, they called Akbar to their home. Here they tranquillized the victim with some sedative tablets and smothered him to death with a pillow. Later, the accused cut the victim’s body into pieces, packed the remains in polythene bags and put it all in one luggage bag. Autorickshaw driver Naushad took the bag in his auto and dumped it near Sarangpur on Rajpipla road. The bag was recovered on Wednesday. With the help of surveillance and human intelligence, cops caught the three killers who have been identified as Lesina Zakir Abdul Mulla, 37, Mufis Mohammad Mulla, 34, both from Naudal district of Bangladesh, and Ajom Samsu Sheikh, 55 of Khulna district. Accused Naushad is, however, absconding. Police have registered an FIR under IPC 302, 201, 114, and GP Act 135.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/3-bdeshi-migrants-held-for-murder/articleshow/84280487.cms||---

Police first found the body of Shivam Joshi from the sewer on Sidsar-Vartej road and further investigation led them to the flat in which his mother Ankita was killed. The crime was allegedly executed by Ankita’s paramour Hemal Shah in Jan Kalyan Apartment on Waghwadi Road where he lived. Shah and Ankita, who are both divorced, were in a relationship for the past one year and she had come to live with him permanently with her son on Thursday. Shah has an air-condition repair shop. On finding Shivam’s body, police thoroughly scanned the CCTV cameras and narrowed down on some cars which looked suspicious from their movements. At the same time, they also got information from Jan Kalyan Apartment about some untoward incident. When police reached the apartment, they found Ankita lying dead in a pool of blood. They picked up Shah for questioning and he confessed to have committed the crime. “Shah slit the throats of the woman and her son. There was some bitter quarrel between them when Ankita came to his house to start living there. However, we are still questioning the accused to ascertain the reason behind such a ghastly crime,” said Safi Hassan, assistant superintendent of police, Bhavnagar. After killing Ankita and Shivam, Shah dumped the latter’s body in his car and threw it in the drainage line, around seven km from his apartment, as it was an isolated spot with minimal human movement. Police have also recovered an axe and a knife from the crime spot and sent the weapons for forensic examination. Sources in the police department said that Shah was earlier booked in offences of prohibition, thefts as well as cruelty towards animals as he had mercilessly flogged a stray dog in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/woman-son-murdered-by-her-paramour-in-bhavnagar/articleshow/84280642.cms||---

The onset of the monsoon is expected to be declared in Delhi on Saturday and light showers are expected through the city, the meteorological department forecasts. Track the pollution level in your cityPeak intensity of monsoon rain is, however, expected between Sunday and Tuesday. “Conditions are favourable for further advancement of southwest monsoon over Delhi, remaining parts of west Uttar Pradesh; some more parts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan during the next 24 hours,” said IMD’s daily monsoon bulletin on Friday. Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, recorded a maximum temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius on Friday. However, Delhi’s hottest location was Najafgarh with a maximum temperature of around 39.6 degrees Celsius. “Easterly and south-easterly winds are now blowing towards Delhi and the monsoon is expected to touch Delhi soon. Spells of light to moderate rain are then expected for the next five to six days,” said a Met official. The maximum temperature is expected to drop to around 37 degrees by Saturday, 35 degrees Celsius by Sunday and 32 degrees Celsius by Monday, owing to rains and cooler winds. The weather department has forecast ‘moderate’ rainfall on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. The monsoon has already been delayed by around two weeks this year as its normal onset date in Delhi was June 27. If its onset is officially declared on Saturday, it will be Delhi’s slowest monsoon onset in the last 18 years. In 2002, it touched the capital on July 19. In comparison, the monsoon reached Delhi on June 25 last year. “Rainfall activity will pick up from Saturday onwards and the seven-day forecast shows rainfall activity till July 15,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/monsoons-almost-here-expect-rain-cooler-winds-from-today/articleshow/84277825.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Nanded: Cops told to address family feuds reaching police stations||AURANGABAD: Nanded range special inspector general of police (IGP) Nisar Tamboli, taking cognizance of surge in violence cases involving family members, has issued directives asking all police stations to address all family-related feuds on priority. Earlier this week, Nanded district reported three murder cases in one day and in each case the accused were immediate blood relatives of the victims. “We have asked the police stations to take serious note of every minor complaint where the complainant and cross-complainant are from the same family or relatives. This will ensure timely preventive and appropriate action and avoid the case taking violent turns.” Citing police record, the senior officer said in most of the cases the dispute is about possession or inappropriate distribution of properties, especially farmlands. “Each year, the number of complaints reaching the police registers a surge during the sowing season, as it is a time when every farmer tries to reclaim his portion of the land, while the encroachers try to retain the area being by carrying out sowing on it,” Tamboli said. The second most common reason for physical violence among family members is liquor addiction, leading to fights and even murders. As per instructions from Tamboli, policemen have been asked to conduct spot visits and cross-verify both the sides, before initiating action against either of the sides. Instructions have also been given to abstain from drawing conclusions by merely sitting on the desk. Three murder cases registered with Ardhapur, Mahur and Mukhed police stations on Tuesday. In the cases registered at the first two police stations, the deceased were brutally stabbed, while in the third case, the victim was bludgeoned to death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cops-told-to-address-family-feuds-reaching-police-stations/articleshow/84274768.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Heatwaves keep Delhi sweating — and guessing||NEW DELHI: Heatwave conditions usually abate in the Delhi region by mid-June. This year, however, there were seven heatwave days in the latter part of June and early July, when usually there is pre-monsoon weather activity. The city did not record a single heatwave day in April and May and just one in March-end. But the eight heatwave days recorded this year are the highest in the last seven years. Experts attribute the heatwave to lack of rain in June and July. India Meteorological Department defines a heatwave day as one with when the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees above the normal and the maximum is at least 40 degrees Celsius. A heatwave also occurs when the maximum temperature touches 45 degrees Celsius. A severe heatwave is declared when the maximum is 6.5 degrees and more above normal. In Delhi, most of the heatwave days occur in April, May and the first week of June. However, this year not a single heatwave day was recorded between April and the first half of June. A severe heatwave day swept the capital all the way back in March, again unusual for that time of the year. “A series of western disturbances and two cyclonic storms — Cyclone Tauktae and Cyclone Yaas — helped keep the mercury in check,” said a Met official. “Under the influence of Cyclone Tauktae, the city also recorded the highest single-day ever rainfall in May. Delhi saw thunderstorms and cloudiness on most days from April to mid-June and the temperatures mostly remained below the normal-mark.” In July, the capital has recorded five heatwave days so far, the most in nine years, just short of the seven in July 2012. As IMD’s forecast says the onset of monsoon over Delhi is likely to happen soon, another heatwave is unlikely this year. Abinash Mohanty, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), says the 2021 summer will be seen as one of anomalies, characterised by consecutive heatwave days and increased wet-bulb temperatures at June-end and early July. Mohanty explained, “The delayed onset of monsoon due to a complex interaction of westerly winds with moisture carrying easterly winds impacting the weather patterns and micro-climate. Globally, the rise in wet-bulb temperatures has led to mass mortality and can have severe repercussions on human health and productivity, industrial revenue and agricultural productivity.” R.K Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said several western disturbances in April and May did not allow temperatures to rise significantly. “Generally, one gets 3-5 western disturbances in a month, but April and May saw even up to 11 in a month, which brought regular rainfall over the northern plains. Due to this, the maximum temperature hardly crossed 42 degrees Celsius,” said Jenamani, adding that even when the monsoon arrives at June-end, it is generally weak and heatwave days in late June or early July aren’t so uncommon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/heatwaves-keep-city-sweating-and-guessing/articleshow/84277813.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Chandigarh||Plea in HC for ending ban on film Pb, Hry said is based on gangster||Chandigarh: A petition has been filed before the Punjab and Haryana high court, seeking directions to lift the ban on the exhibition of the movie ‘Shooter’ in Punjab and Haryana. The petitioner sought directions for quashing of notification dated February 10, 2020, issued by the Punjab home department whereby the film’s screening was suspended. The Haryana government had also invoked similar provisions to ban the film in the state, after the ban in Punjab. The court has now posted the hearing of the case for July 13, when the state governments would respond to contentions raised in the petition. The matter has reached the court in the wake of a petition filed by Kewal Singh, a resident of Mohali. The petitioner, claiming to be owner of a music record company, has stated he had produced the movie in Punjabi and English subtitles. The trailer of the movie was released on January 18, 2020, and it was to be released on February 21, 2020. It has been submitted that the notification on imposing a ban on the exhibition of the movie was without jurisdiction because the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) had already issued a certificate on March 13, 2020, for the release of the movie. It has been argued the Supreme Court (SC), in its order dated August 19, 2011, in the case titled ‘Prakash Jha Productions versus Union of India’, has already held that once the board has cleared the film for public viewing, screening of the same cannot be prohibited in the manner as sought to be done by the state. The Punjab government, through its notification dated February 10, 2020, suspended the exhibition of the film with immediate effect. During such suspension, the film shall be deemed to be uncertified film in the state, it said. The allegations, according to the notification, is that the story of this movie is based on the life of gangster Sukha Kahlon, who was killed by rival gangster Vicky Gounder in January 2015, when six policemen were taking Kahlon back to Nabha jail in a jeep after a court hearing in Jalandhar. The order was to remain in force for a period of two months from the date of issue. After Punjab, an order dated February 20, 2020, was issued by the Haryana government suspending the exhibition and screening of the film in Haryana, citing the same allegations. Petitioner’s counsel Vijay Pal submitted that at the start of the movie, there was a disclaimer that the movie was a work of fiction, and that names, characters, businesss, places, events, locales and incidents are used in a fictitious manner and any resemblance to actual persons living or dead or actual events is purely coincidental. “The makers of the film had no intention to mislead the younger generation. This movie is solely for the purpose of entertainment. The movie is not promoting gun culture or gangsters in the state of Punjab and Haryana. Therefore, it is apparent the disclaimer made therein should take care of unfounded, baseless apprehensions of the state governments. CBFC has already issued a certificate to the movie clarifying the film is valid for theatrical display,” Pal has contended. The counsel informed the HC that according to the Section 6 (3) of The Punjab Cinemas (regulation) Act 1952, an order made under this section for banning a movie shall remain in force for a period of two months from the date and the suspension shall be extended by such further period as it thinks fit. In the present case, the period of suspension has not been extended, HC has been informed||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/plea-in-hc-for-ending-ban-on-film-pb-hry-said-is-based-on-gangster/articleshow/84283351.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||‘Hounded out’ of Kerala, Kitex to invest Rs 1,000 crore in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Floored by the Telangana government’s red carpet treatment after the alleged harassment by the Kerala government, apparel giant Kitex Group on Friday announced a Rs 1,000 crore investment in Telangana. The company announced the phase-1 investment in setting up apparel units in the Kakatiya Mega Textile Park (KMTP) at Warangal over the next two years. The investment is slated to generate around 4,000 jobs. Telangana pulled out all stops in a hitherto unheard of wooing exercise that included chartering a special flight to fly in the Kitex Group team headed by its chairman and managing director Sabu M Jacob from Kochi to Hyderabad. The five-member team held one-to-one meetings with Telangana’s industries minister KT Rama Rao as well as top industries department officials such as principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan. This included a marathon three-hour meeting with KTR on Friday afternoon where he apprised them of the state government’s policies, including the TSiPASS single window clearance system, and pitched Telangana's quality cotton. The Kitex team was later flown to Warangal in a helicopter. Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) vice-chairman & managing director EV Narasimha Reddy personally accompanied them and gave them a guided tour of the 1,200-acre KMTP. The special treatment also included an elaborate lunch and dinner that was hosted by KTR and the industries department team at a five-star hotel opposite Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s camp office. “The Kitex officials said they were impressed by the swift and effective response of the Telangana government. They said it shows the government’s commitment to attract investments to the state and that they have not received such a good response from any other state,” said a Telangana government official. The Kerala-based apparel biggie was being wooed by several states after its CMD alleged that he was “attacked like an animal” by the Kerala government and announced that he was withdrawing his Rs 3,500 crore investment, but Telangana stole a march with its aggressive and proactive investor-friendly moves. The group has been at loggerheads with the Kerala government over the past month or so after the government carried out several inspections and raids on its units, which the company termed as harassment. The Kitex CMD was accompanied by the group’s directors Benni Joseph and KLV Narayanan as well as vice-president of business & operations Harkishan Singh Sodhi and general manager of planning and projects Saji Kurian.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hounded-out-of-kerala-kitex-to-invest-rs-1k-cr-in-t/articleshow/84281526.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Delhi||Delhi withdraws plea for closure of 10 power plants||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday said it was “surprising and amusing” to find the Aam Aadmi Party government filing a PIL against Centre and three states for closure of 10 power plants within 300 km radius of the capital to reduce pollution when it could have easily intervened in the pending air pollution matter for appropriate remedies. “We have a lot of questions to ask. And if we ask those questions, we do not know in which direction the PIL will go,” said a bench of Justices Navin Sinha and R S Reddy after hearing lengthy arguments from senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, who said the power plants are major contributors of noxious NO2 and SO2 gases. Armed with reports from IIT Kanpur and other scientific organisations on causes of air pollution in Delhi, Gonsalves said the AAP government is sensitive to the sufferings of Delhiites from air pollution and stressed for closure of 10 thermal power plants in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, which he said were major contributors of noxious gases and particulate matters that severely pollute the air of the capital. The Delhi government sought installation of fuel gas desulphurisation (FGD) devices in all these power plants or their closure. The AAP government said it closed the thermal power plant in Delhi long ago and accused the Centre and the concerned states of not adhering to the deadline for installation of FGD devices in the power plants to curb emission of pollutants into the atmosphere. Gonsalves said the deadline was fixed at 2024 but with the Supreme Court intervention it was brought forward to 2019, which was pushed back to 2021 and now again to 2024. The bench said, “We followed your case as you have explained it very clearly. But it is amusing to find Delhi government coming in a PIL against the Centre.” “On merit,” the bench said, “If the Union government had told the Supreme Court about a deadline by which the fuel gas desulphurisationdevices are to be installed and they have done something contrary, then the proper course for the Delhi government would be to intervene in that pending case and point it out to the court, and not filing a PIL. We have a lot of questions to ask. If you want to go before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) then do so. If you want to intervene in the pending matter before the SC, that is also open for you. We are giving you the option.” Gonsalves’s attempts to convince the bench to issue notice to the Centre on the Delhi government’s PIL, and then tagging it with the pending matter remained futile as the bench remained firm with its two options. Gonsalves withdrew the Delhi government’s PIL with liberty to intervene in the pending air pollution matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-withdraws-plea-for-closure-of-10-power-plants/articleshow/84277305.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Delhi||Nod to real-time study to identify capital’s pollutants||New Delhi: The Delhi cabinet on Friday approved a project to carry out real-time source apportionment to identify the capital’s biggest source of pollution at any given time. Environment minister Gopal Rai said Delhi government would be the first to commission a study to find out and monitor real time the sources of air pollution. He said this would go a long way in identifying various factors contributing to Delhi’s pollution and mitigating them. A team of IIT Kanpur, IIT Delhi, TERI and IISER-Mohali will execute the study. “The technology to carry out real-time source apportionment of pollution has not been implemented in any other city in the country. Following the approval from the cabinet, scientists will start working on this innovative project in full swing,” said Rai. He added that under the leadership of CM Arvind Kejriwal, the first-of-its-kind study would help curb air pollution and sources would be tracked in real time and help initiate appropriate action on a near real-time basis. The project will help identify factors responsible for spike in air pollution at any spot. It will help understand the real-time impact of various pollution sources like vehicles, dust, biomass and stubble burning, and industrial emissions. Based on its results, the government will be able to take necessary actions to curb the sources. Dr Mukesh Sharma, scientist at IIT Kanpur who is leading the study, said, “The team is excited to partner with Delhi government on this unique project, which will provide daily and weekly forecast of air quality and real-time diurnal source apportionment, and suggest short-term daily and weekly actions to systematically assess, reduce and prevent air quality deterioration in Delhi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nod-to-real-time-study-to-identify-capitals-pollutants/articleshow/84277261.cms||---

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday directed officials to begin the process of recruitment to fill up 50,000 vacancies in various government departments immediately. “While the process to fill up the vacancies in all the departments should start immediately, vacancies created after giving promotions to existing employees should be taken up in the second phase,” the CM said at a review meeting on job vacancies. Decks for the new zonal system, which was necessary to undertake recruitment, had been cleared by the Centre recently. The Centre cleared the news zones and multi-zones, which were modified in tune with the new districts, a couple of months ago. The state government also issued a GO following the gazette notification on the new zonal system. The CM said the recruitment process under the former rulers in undivided AP was disorganised. One of the slogans of the Telangana statehood movement was jobs for locals and the government brought the new zonal system scientifically only to do justice to the locals, he said. “With the President giving his assent, all the obstacles for the recruitment policy in the state have been cleared. There are about 50,000 jobs, which can be recruited directly. The government has begun the process of promotions in all the departments as well. Jobs falling vacant after implementing the promotions will be identified soon,” KCR said. He instructed the officials to get the entire information and data on the vacancies by preparing a detailed report and place it before the state cabinet meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/start-process-to-fill-up-50k-govt-jobs-cm/articleshow/84279389.cms||Koride Mahesh

Munde interacted with reporters on Friday in Beed and said failing to post congratulatory tweet to the newly-appointed Union ministers should not be taken as her disappointment. “After being hand-picked as union ministers I personally spoke with Bharti Pawar, Kapil Patil and Dr Bhagwat Karad,” she said. On being asked about the editorial in Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece Samana, alleging she and her sister have been intentionally sidelined for not being part of team Devendra Fadnavis, Pankaja said, “I am not aware as to who is part of team Devendra or team Narendra (Modi). The BJP does not acknowledge or recognize any such team. Our party’s motto is nation first, party second and then the individual.” She added, “My sister and I never met anyone with any request for being considered for the post of Union minister. We do not have any objection to the new entrants as the decision makers know what will benefit the party and the country.” Beed MP Preetam’s name was making rounds as one of the probables to be considered in the cabinet reshuffle. “In my opinion, Preetam was a deserving candidate for being considered in the expansion. She is a hardworking and dedicated, but I believe that party’s decision is the final,” Pankaja said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/did-not-demand-preetams-inclusion-in-cabinet-pankaja/articleshow/84274854.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The family lives on rent in an MMRDA building for project-affected people constructed 10 years ago. Residents said this is the second time a ceiling plaster crash had occurred and despite petitioning the authorities repeatedly, no repairs had been undertaken. Goregaon police had not pressed any charges at the time of going to press. Times ViewThe government should immediately order a full-scale structural audit of all such buildings constructed for project-affected people. If the ceiling of a barely decade-old building can collapse, it implies the structure is of poor quality. The contractor should be questioned and taken to task.Arsalan Ansari, a school-goer, lived with his mother, Fehmida (36) and grandmother at Aman P8 society, part of a large cluster of 30 MMRDA buildings. The flat owner used to live in Bandra’s Bharat Nagar slums and moved to Goregaon to the MMRDA building a decade ago along with other PAPs due to a project. Around 4am, the ceiling plaster collapsed in the Ansari’s 225-square-foot accomodation. The debris buried Arsalan and struck his mother on her face. The child’s grandmother was asleep on a cot and woke up with a start. She rushed to neighbouring homes, screaming for help. “We were all fast asleep. By the time we woke up and stumbled into the Ansari home, there was debris all over, some of which was soaked in blood,” said Mewalal Gupta, a neighbour. Someone dialled the police emergency number ‘100’. After the police vehicle arrived, neighbours placed the severely injured child and his mother into it. They were rushed to Cooper Hospital in Vile Parle, where Arsalan was declared dead. His traumatized mother was admitted. Witnesses said she had suffered injuries to her eyes, nose, lips as well as her legs. “Arsalan’s father is a driver in central Mumbai and does not live with them. He visits the family sometimes,” a neighbour said. “Arsalan was an only child. His grandmother is distraught. The family was facing financial difficulties for a long time. The child never bothered his mother with unnecessary demands,” the neighbour added. About four years ago, another house on the third floor of the same building had witnessed a ceiling plaster collapse. “The family had escaped narrowly. Since then, we have repeatedly written to the MMRDA for carrying out repairs,” said Qasam Ahmed Shaikh, the society’s secretary. He added a couple of months ago, some of the residents had a meeting with an MMRDA officer at their Bandra office. “We were told that our set of 10 buildings (P1 to P10) was a disaster and in a couple of years, we would be moved to a new accommodation. We demanded to know what if a crisis occurred before that,” said Shaikh. He added that some of the PAPs in these buildings were moved here from Bharat Nagar slums in Bandra, some from Sakinaka and others from Andheri’s Four Bungalows. Following the incident, local corporator Sandeep Patel met the MMRDA authorities with a letter seeking an audit of the buildings. “While the MMRDA has constructed these buildings to accommodate PAPs, they are poorly maintained. The planning authority does not have the infrastructure to maintain these buildings and any kind of repairs required has to go through a lengthy tender process. Many of these buildings are in a shoddy condition despite not being very old and so, a structural audit of them is needed,” said Patel. He has also demanded financial assistance for the Ansaris. MMRDA did not comment when contacted by TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/8-yr-old-killed-mother-hurt-as-ceiling-crashes/articleshow/84283377.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Ramky Group faked Rs 1,200 crore loss to evade tax, says I-T department||HYDERABAD: After its recent searches on YSRC Rajya Sabha member Ayodhya Rami Reddy-run Ramky Group of Companies, the income tax department has detected an artificial loss of Rs 1,200 crore ‘incurred’ by the group, which, it said, was done to evade capital gains tax. The company has also admitted to unaccounted income of Rs 300 crore and agreed to pay the tax arrears. The I-T department had carried out a search and seizure operation on the Hyderabad-based Ramky Group on July 6. During the operation, I-T sleuths seized several incriminating documents and loose sheets, indicating the involvement of the group in unaccounted transactions. Ramky Group, promoted by Rami Reddy’s family, had sold majority stake in one of the group concerns to a non-resident entity based in Singapore during financial year 2018-19 and earned huge capital gains. The department said: “Ramky Group subsequently devised various colourable schemes by means of entering into a series of share purchase, sale, non-arm’s length value subscription and subsequent bonus issuance, etc., with related parties, creating a loss, which was set off against the capital gains earned. The incriminating evidence (documents) has been recovered, which indicates that the loss was artificially created to set off the capital gains (sic).” The group is also accused of making an incorrect claim of bad debts to the tune of Rs 288 crore on account of related party transactions, which was set off against the aforementioned profits earned. During searches, incriminating documents relating to this artificial/incorrect claim were found. Unaccounted cash transactions with associates of the group have also been detected during the search, the I-T department said. “The quantum and modus of the same is under examination,” it added. The group is engaged in real estate, construction, waste management and infrastructure. Ramky Enviro Engineers, the flagship company, is into waste management and is spread across India, while the group’s real estate activities are mainly concentrated in Hyderabad. Ramky Infrastructure, Ramky Enviro Engineers, Ramky Villas Limited and Ramky Farms and Estates are some of the key companies of the group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ramky-group-faked-rs-1200-cr-loss-to-evade-tax-i-t-dept/articleshow/84281568.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Goa||Goa: Those evading indirect taxes will be arrested, says Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Taking a stern view of tax evasion in the state, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday said that those dodging indirect taxes will be dealt with severely and will be arrested. The Goa GST intelligence unit and enforcement wing has been asked to track down taxpayers who have pending dues, Sawant said at the inaugural of the new GST Commissionerate building at Altinho. “Those who don’t pay taxes will be arrested,” Sawant said. “People who owe the state Rs 20 crore or similar amounts should not wait for us to act.” On Thursday, Goods and Service Tax (GST) officers made their first arrest for evasion of GST and VAT since 2017. Mukhtar Shaikh and Maheed Xec were arrested for defaulting on Rs 20.9 crore in taxes. The two directors of a Verna-based automobile retailer owe the state department of commercial taxes Rs 20.9 crore towards GST and VAT of Rs 11.5 crore including tax, interest and penalty. The accused, who have been charged with offences committed under Section 132 (1) (c) and Section 132 (1) (d) of the Goa Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, were released on bail. Sawant and state GST commissioner Hemant Kumar said that the GST economic intelligence unit and enforcement wing have begun taking proactive measures to ensure recovery of taxes. The chief minister said that many commercial taxpayers continue to avoid paying tax, which in turn affects the state government’s functioning. “For the first time someone has been arrested for not paying taxes. Those who don’t pay taxes will be arrested. They cannot hide from the government any more because the enforcement wing is now working very well,” he said. Sawant said that there are firms in Goa which owe the state government over Rs 20 crore each. “If they pay the tax on time it will benefit the government. They have a responsibility to be responsible citizens as they enjoy the facilities of the country. I request them not to bring political pressure on the staff once penalty is imposed or action is taken,” he said. Under the earlier VAT regime, there were 28,000 commercial tax payers in Goa, but since the introduction of GST, the government has been able to identify additional commercial entities with the total number of indirect tax payers in Goa touching 43,000. Kumar said that the economic intelligence unit has been able to plug leakages and curb evasion. “We have been able to recover around Rs 15 crore through enforcement activities. The department is also monitoring the big tax payers who contribute major taxes and is doing a sectorwise analysis by taking data from income tax and other government departments,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tax-evaders-will-be-arrested-says-cm/articleshow/84281667.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: DGP-led panel set up to probe Nana Patole’s phone-tapping claims||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government on Friday set up a three-member committee, headed by the state director general of police (DGP), to probe the phone-tapping allegations made by state Congress president and MLA Nana Patole in the recently concluded monsoon session of the state legislature. The panel has to submit its report in three months. On June 5, Patole had alleged that during the BJP’s rule between 2014 and 2019, phones of leading members of Parliament and legislators, including his own, were illegally tapped for political reasons. Responding to the allegations, state home minister Dilip Walse Patil on Tuesday promised a high-level inquiry in the matter. On Friday, the state home department issued an order appointing a committee comprising the DGP, state intelligence commissioner and additional police commissioner (special cell) to probe whether the phones of politicians were illegally tapped between 2015 and 2019, and if so, fix responsibility for the lapses. According to rules, it is necessary to secure permission from the competent authority for phone surveillance, and the name of the person whose phone would be under surveillance has to be clearly stated, along with the purpose of surveillance. “The government had made a statement about illegal phone-tapping in the monsoon session and so the committee has been formed. Many politicians had raised the issue even during the assembly elections. All those complaints too will be looked into,” said an official. Patole had alleged, “In 2016-17, my cellphone was under surveillance, along with phones of several MPs and legislators. I found that while the number under surveillance was mine, it was given the name Amjad Khan. It was then stated that Khan was involved in drug smuggling. It was an attempt to create rift between two communities...This is an attempt to destroy our political careers. I was an MP then, so there was no reason to tap my phone.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dgp-led-panel-set-up-to-probe-patoles-phone-tapping-claims/articleshow/84283386.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Hyderabad||Telangana’s migrant worker policy to focus on insurance, food & education||HYDERABAD: Soon, Telangana might emerge as one of the first states in India to roll out a migrant workers policy, enabling them to participate “in the economic activity” of the state. A draft policy – a copy of which is available with the TOI – assures numerous benefits for migrant workers and their families, including accident insurance, ration cards, affordable rental housing, school admissions, among others. It also sets out to offer health benefits under the Ayushman Bharat scheme and travel grant – “to and from to the native place of a worker” -- for emergency cases. At present, the government is in the process of collating data on the count of migrant workers in Telangana. The deadline for the survey is July 15. “Different departments have been assigned different sectors where these workers are employed – industries, brick kilns, construction, street vendors etc. Once we have the numbers, the draft will be taken to the cabinet,” said Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary of industries and commerce. He added: “The insurance and travel grant are among our unique features that no other state has considered so far.” While the official count is still awaited, rough estimates of civil society groups suggest that Telangana is home to about 15 lakh migrant workers – a sizeable population working in brick kilns, construction sites and the food business. Logistics and security are other segments that employ a large group of migrants. “Last year’s migrant crisis brought to fore two things -- the living condition of the migrant workforce and the critical role they play in the state’s economy,” said Kiran Kumar Vissa of Rythu Swarajya Vedika who worked closely with the government on this draft. “This policy is pertinent to establish an identity for this section of workers in Telangana and thereby allow them access to basic amenities – food security, shelter, health etc.” Amid the first wave of Covid-19, roughly two to three lakh migrant workers from Telangana returned to their home states for lack of food, shelter and employment here. “The registration of workers will be a dynamic process to ensure that all migrants travelling for work to Telangana are covered under the policy,” Ranjan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ts-migrant-worker-policy-to-focus-on-insurance-food-edu/articleshow/84281611.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||India||Government issues SoPs for tackling violators of green guidelines||NEW DELHI: Acting on order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and several observations made by different courts time-to-time, the environment ministry has come out with standard operating procedures (SOPs) for dealing with cases of green violations. The measures which are to be taken against erring projects include demolition or closure of non-complying units and stiff penalties under ‘polluter pays’ principle. The five-point SOPs, issued to different agencies including Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and state PCBs this week, also include the procedural details for identification of violation and non-compliance, and a formula to impose penalties. Under penalty provisions, the new project which has not yet commenced its operations will have to pay 1% of total project cost as penalty for violation while the erring projects where operations have already commenced would have to additionally pay 0.25% of total turnover during the period of violation. The provisions, issued by the ministry as an 'Office Memorandum’ (OM), take into account ‘principles of proportionality’ and the money, collected as penalties, will be used as ‘costs for remedial measures’ in areas where the violators had damaged the environment. Environmentalists, however, said that this regulation should have come through a proper notification, issued under the Environment (Protection) Act 1986, and this should not have come through the mode of OM. “The central government neither circulated the draft, nor did it seek public comments. Such substantial law could not be enacted through an OM,” said Ritwick Dutta, environmental lawyer and founder of the Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment (LIFE). He said, “It is problematic since for the first time the applicant has the option for complying or not complying with the law. If they find that compliance with the law is expensive then they can decide to continue without approval.” The CPCB and state PCBs have been empowered to take action against violators as per the SOPs which have been prepared to speed up action against the violators of green norms across the country. The SOPs, issued under Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) notification of 2006, said that projects which were not “permissible” for grant of environmental clearance (EC) would be demolished. On the other hand, the projects which are permissible but haven’t got prior EC will have to be closed “until EC is granted” or to be revert to permitted production level if prior EC is there but it doesn’t have green clearance for increasing production or expanding the units such as industries, mines and buildings. The OM also spoke about setting up a “mechanism for reporting of violations to the regulatory authorities”. Dutta believes that the SOP does not have any legal basis. "It is important that the ministry should withdraw this and in fact strengthen the punishment provisions in the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 which would serve as a better deterrent,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-issues-sops-for-tackling-violators-of-green-guidelines/articleshow/84284798.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Delhi||No bail to Amrapali MD in scam of crores||New Delhi: A Delhi court has dismissed the bail plea of Amrapali Group’s managing director Anil Kumar Sharma in a multi-crore scam involving alleged cheating of investors and home buyers. Additional sessions judge Reetesh Singh noted that Sharma allegedly induced the complainant to enter into an agreement to purchase 26 flats in a project that was non-existent/never sanctioned by the Noida Authority. The court said that the case was not an isolated one against Sharma but a part of several cases of cheating and fraud which are pending against him under the direct supervision of the Supreme Court. “The facts of the present case reveal an intention on the part of the applicant/accused since inception to cheat the complainant of his money,” it said in its order. Advocate Gaurav Dalal, appearing for complainant Anubhav Jain, had claimed that the investigation has revealed that the agreement/transaction between the parties was for sale/purchase of 26 flats and Rs 6.6 crores was paid to the accused, but later it came to light that the flats were in a non-existent project. An FIR was registered by the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police on the complaint of Jain against M/s Amrapali Silicon City Pvt Ltd and its directors or officials, including Sharma. It has been alleged in the FIR that in November 2011, the directors had approached Jain and represented that they would hand over vacant physical possession of 26 fully furnished flats in Tower-G1 in the project “Amrapali Silicon City”, proposed to be developed at Sector-76, Noida, by September 2013. On this inducement, the complainant invested in the project by making full payment of Rs 6.6 crore in November 2011, and an MoU was also signed as per which possession of the flats would be delivered by September 2013, the FIR claimed. The police said the investigation revealed that Tower G-1 was not sanctioned by the Noida Authority, but still the accused persons sold/allotted the flats. The accused persons allegedly misrepresented the project to the complainants through advertising materials wherein attractive photographs were displayed to induce the investors. Sharma had claimed before the court that he was falsely implicated in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-bail-to-amrapali-md-in-scam-of-crores/articleshow/84304606.cms||Usha Das

The city police took the action based on the complaint by Ganesh Dhoble (33) of Jambhli in Paithan. Inspector Surendra Malale said Dhoble had in November 2019 started looking for a flat and spoke to some of his contacts working as real estate agents. Initially, three men assured him to help get a flat in an upscale locality and introduced him to four others. The four men took him to an apartment in Sainik Vihar of Kanchanwadi. Dhoble decided to purchase a flat there and paid Rs 25 lakh. The suspects signed a sale deed and assured him to hand over the flat in the next couple of months. The police said the suspects never owned the flat. “Prima facie it appears that the suspects wanted to make some fast money by purchasing the flat from the original owner and then sell it to Dhoble at a higher price,” said the officer. But they failed to crack a deal with the original owner and started avoiding Dhoble. The agents remained non-committal about returning the money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/7-agents-booked-on-charge-ofduping-man-of-rs-25l/articleshow/84274968.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Warangne’s family confirmed it. The probe revealed that Zuber was facing serious financial loss and was under various debts.

However, in a directive, issued by the university to colleges, it mentioned that the assignment-based evaluation (ABE), now mandatory for the law exam that was skipped last year, may or may not be applicable to this set of students. It has left students and colleges confused. The directive said that students who have admission offers from foreign universities for their LLM programme can apply to their colleges with details and admission proof. ‘Principals, on receipt of such applications, shall verify the authenticity and urgency of such applications and only genuine applications shall be forwarded to the director, board of examinations and evaluation, at the earliest’, mentioned the directive. It added that colleges should also issue results/statement of marks of ABE, if applicable. Results of such students will be confidentially handed over by the exam house to facilitate their transcripts, visas, bank loans and other formalities. “The last line, in the circular, however, is confusing. They are asking colleges to submit the ABE scores ‘if applicable’. If scorecards of all students from the April-May 2020 exam are nullified, then the ABE should be ideally applicable to all,” said a principal, adding that some colleges allowed an improvement exam to these students. “The university probably is asking us to announce the results of such students early,” said another principal. LLM aspirants, however, are relieved that the varsity may hand over their marksheets on time and they may be able to keep their seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-early-results-for-foreign-bound-llb-pupils-but-univs-rider-foxes-colleges/articleshow/84283428.cms||Yogita Rao

The India Meteorological Department has issued orange alert for the district stating heavy to very heavy showers for the next four days — from July 10 to 13. As per data recorded by the state agriculture department between Thursday and Friday, Kolhapur district received 6.6mm rainfall with Gagan Bawda receiving the maximum 22.2mm showers followed by Karveer (12.1mm) and Panhala (10.9mm). At 0.6mm, Gadhinglaj received the least rainfall. Satish Jagtap, a farmer from Kuditre village, said, “We were done with paddy and soybean sowing, and were eagerly waiting for the showers. Without rain, we would have ben forced to carry out the entire sowing process again. With rains resuming we won’t have to rely on artificial methods to water the plants now. Hopefully, the rains will continue for some time.” Meanwhile, Shubhangi Bhute, deputy director, IMD Mumbai, said the monsoon has been revived as the “synoptic situations (pressure pattern, wind direction and speed) necessary for the monsoon have become favourable, along with formation of a low pressure area in the Bay of Bengal”. “Because of this, the entire Maharashtra will get good rainfall for the next 4 to 5 days, whereas there will be rain with thunder at some isolated places,” Bhute said. The monsoon arrived in Maharashtra in the first week of June. After several days of bountiful rains, the monsoon took a break with parts of the states receiving only sporadic showers. — With Agency inputs||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-gets-rain-after-gap-of-fortnight-farmers-relieved/articleshow/84275049.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

The family lived in an MMRDA building for project-affected people (PAP), which was built 10 years ago. Residents said this is the second time a ceiling plaster crash had occurred and despite petitioning the authorities repeatedly, no repairs had been undertaken. Goregaon police had not pressed any charges at the time of going to press. Arsalan Ansari, a school-goer, lived with his mother, Fehmida (36) and grandmother at Aman P8 society, part of a large cluster of 30 MMRDA buildings. The Ansaris live here on rent. The house was rented from an individual who used to live in Bandra’s Bharat Nagar slums and due to a project there, he was moved to the Goregaon MMRDA building a decade ago along with other PAPs. Around 4am, the ceiling plaster collapsed in the Ansari’s 225-square-foot accomodation. The debris buried Arsalan and struck his mother on her face.

But as the situation started to improve traders from Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Sindhudurg districts had started demanding resumption of the flights. The plane will take off from Ahmedabad at 7:50am and will reach Kolhapur at 10:10am. The same flight will then take-off from Kolhapur at 10:30am and reach Ahmedabad at 12:50pm on the aforementioned days. Lalit Gandhi, deputy head of Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, said, “Traders and industrialists from Kolhapur and surrounding districts keep travelling to Ahmedabad for business purposes.

The Kolhapur-Ahmedabad flight service will be operated by IndiGo airlines. Vishal Bhargav, airport manager for IndiGo airline, said, “The flight service to Ahmedabad was getting good response when it started this year on February 22 but due to Covid restrictions and compulsory RT-PCR negative test report, the passenger count had dropped.

A separate enclosure has been planned to increase breeding of spotted deer in the Chandoli region. Uttam Sawant, deputy director of Sahyadri tiger reserve, said, “Since the past three-four years, the Wildlife Institute of India is conducting a research on tiger behaviour and it was noticed that the prey count is not increasing fast due to which the tigers do not settle in the tiger reserve.” He added, “The forest department often gets reports about the tiger sighting, but due to less number of prey the tigers do not settle here and keep migrating to Tilari and northern Karnataka region.” Since the last 10 years, rehabilitation of the villages in core forest area was given priority and now only few villages are left and will be moved soon. The spotted deer were earlier found in Chandoli region, but due to hunting and higher number of predators like leopards and wild dogs, their population kept decreasing. “Now, the forest department is creating a separate enclosure in Chandoli region where spotted deer will be kept for breeding so to increase their population. Spotted deer are fast-breeding animals and there count increases rapidly. The work for creating the enclosure will be completed by this year-end after which the spotted deer from Sagreshwar wildlife sanctuary will be moved to Chandoli region. Thus, with less human interference and good availability of prey, tigers can settle in Sahyadri tiger reserve” Sawant said. Clement Ben, chief conservator of forests, said, “The Sahyadri tiger reserve is spread in 1,165sqkm area covers Chandoli national park and Koyana wildlife sanctuary, and is well connected with Radhanagari-Dajipur wildlife sanctuary and Tilari conservation reserve. The newly identified conservation reserve, around Kolhapur and Sindhudurg, will act as smooth passage line for the tigers from Tilari and forests from northern Karnataka and Goa into Sahyadri tiger reserve. There are around seven to eight tigers in the STR who keep on moving.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/forest-dept-plans-to-increase-prey-base-to-increase-tiger-population/articleshow/84275085.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Pune||Sanjay Raut seeks ED investigation into smart city projects in Pune's Pimpri Chinchwad||PUNE: Rajya Sabha member and senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Friday raised a pitch for an inquiry by the Enforcement Directorate into the smart city projects in Pimpri Chinchwad. “The BJP-led Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has become an epicentre of corruption. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) should look into it. I will raise a complaint of corruption in the smart city projects with ED,” Raut said during a news conference here. “The BJP had claimed that it would provide a transparent and corruption-free governance. But the smart city projects are examples of corruption. The BJPled PCMC has become the most corrupt civic body in the state. There have been malpractices even in Covid relief work. All the corruption will be unearthed in the days to come,” he said. “Contracts for the smart city projects have been allotted to a company connected to BJP MLAs. The state government has received complaints about it. The government will take necessary action and also urge the ED to intervene,” Raut said. The Shiv Sena leader, however, claimed that the trustworthiness of the investigative agencies “has gone down because of the Union government’s undue interferences”. He said, “Efforts are on to malign politics in Maharashtra by using the investigative agencies.” On the likelihood of forming an alliance with Nationalist Congress party (NCP) and Congress in the coming civic elections, Raut said the decision would be taken in due course. “If a respectable number of seats are given to the Shiv Sena, the civic elections can be fought under the banner of the Maha Vikas Aghadi,” Raut further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/raut-seeks-ed-investigation-into-smart-city-projects-in-pimpri-chinchwad/articleshow/84279617.cms||---
---||Pune||High court tells Pune Municipal Corporation, Maharashtra government to remove Metro debris from riverbed||MUMBAI: The high court on Friday directed the Pune Municipal Corporation and the state government to remove debris from the Metro work sites on Mula-Mutha riverbed. A PIL filed by activists Sarang Yadwadkar, Arnavaz Aga and Arti Kirloskar had alleged that debris was being dumped on the riverbed. On Thursday, their counsel Ronita Bector sought urgent interim orders. They filed an application to “bring on record egregious and reprehensible degree of neglect” demonstrated by the authorities responsible for the Pune Metro rail project. Bector cited a letter from the irrigation department to the executive engineer of the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation (MahaMetro) and the collector about the danger posed by the debris lying on the riverbank at least since January this year. The department stated the debris was not removed despite multiple requests since last year and now may cause floods during the monsoon. Hence the urgency, Bector said. On directions from the bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, PMC counsel Abhijit Kulkarni organized photographs from Sangamwadi and Deccan. The HC studied the photos and said the authorities have “not been honest”. MahaMetro said 95% of the debris, part of a “road to enable approach for construction” was cleared up and the rest would be removed soon. MahaMetro’s counsel S K Mishra said Metro work was being carried out under the guidance of an “expert panel set up in 2017 on orders of the NGT”. Kulkarni said the work was being carried out by a private contractor. HC said PMC and the state have a duty to ensure that the river is kept clean. At his request, the HC directed MahaMetro to cooperate with the cleaning up the debris.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hc-tells-pmc-govt-to-remove-metro-debris-from-riverbed/articleshow/84279611.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Delhi||Delhi: Committee to give its final report on oxygen audit soon||NEW DELHI: The five-member panel appointed by the Supreme Court to conduct an audit on Delhi’s oxygen demands during the second wave is yet to submit its final report. “It might take a few more days,” one of its members said. He added that the interim report had delved mainly into the facts of the case, but the final report would also include recommendations on how to prevent a crisis in future. In its interim report, the panel had suggested that Delhi government exaggerated the oxygen requirement by more than four times during the April 25-May 10 peak period. It also informed the court that supply of excess oxygen to the capital could have affected supply to 12 high caseload states. It led to a war of words between the BJP-led Centre and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi. Dr Randeep Guleria, the AIIMS director who heads the panel, then clarified that oxygen requirement was a dynamic process and requirement would change from day to day and time to time as the pandemic behaved. “It may have been four times or less depending on the ground situation on a particular day. Therefore, it should not be generalised,” he had added. The committee comprised of four more members — B S Bhalla, Delhi government’s principal home secretary; Dr Sandeep Budhiraja of Max Healthcare; Subodh Yadav, joint secretary in the Union jal shakti ministry; and Sanjay Kumar Singh, controller of explosives at Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation. Both Bhalla and Budhiraja questioned the conclusions in the interim report. Sources said the final report would include inputs from all members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/committee-to-give-its-final-report-on-oxygen-audit-soon/articleshow/84279663.cms||---

The State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) on Friday asked the parents to respond to a survey on reopening schools in rural areas where no Covid-19 cases have been reported in the past one month. The survey available on www.maa.ac.in/survey will end on July 12 at 11.55pm. On Wednesday, the state had issued a government resolution to bring back students of class VIII to XII to schools in rural areas that are Covid-free for a month. Every Covid-free village will have a seven-member committee, comprising the sarpanch, talati, health officer, a village level worker, a school management representative, a teacher and the school head, that will take the final decision on reopening a school. While physical schools can start from July 15, state education officers are findi-ng it difficult to obtain parents’ consent to send their children. Most teachers in rural areas want physical schools to start due to issues of internet connectivity, dropout and child labour among others, said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-seeks-parents-opinion-on-sending-children-to-school-in-covid-free-villages/articleshow/84281824.cms||Sandhya Nair

The price revision will come into effect from July 11. Around 11 lakh litre of pouched milk is sold in both the metro cities. The selling price of pouched milk in Mumbai and Pune will now be Rs 60 and Rs 49 per litre for buffalo and cow’s milk respectively. However, the dairy has decided against hiking the selling price of milk being sold in Kolhapur and Konkan region where around 2 lakh litre of milk is sold every day. The dairy has also decided to increase the procurement price of milk to benefit the milk producing farmers from Kolhapur district. MVA ministers Satej Patil and Hasan Mushrif along with Member of Parliament Sanjay Mandlik had promised the farmers to increase the procurement price of milk before the recently concluded Gokul elections. Due to this promise the trio had managed to topple the incumbent panel led by leaders who were at the helm of dairy politics for the last three decades. “We have decided to increase the procurement prices. We will ensure the milk collection from the district is increased so that more farmers can benefit from this,” Patil said. The procurement price for buffalo milk with 7.0% fat has been increased by Rs 2 per litre to Rs 46 per litre. The procurement price for cow’s milk has been increased by Re 1 per litre and the new price for 4% fat milk will be Rs 28.50 per litre. The hike in procurement price will cost the dairy Rs 71 crore annually and will be compensated by the hike in selling price. Around Rs 69 crore will be collected from customers through the hike and the dairy will suffer a burden of Rs 2 crore due to the price revision. Gokul dairy generates a revenue of Rs 2,100 crore every year and the MVA leaders have resolved to increase collection of milk to 20 lakh litre in the next five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/gokul-hikes-milk-prices-by-rs-2-for-pune-mumbai/articleshow/84275172.cms||---

Referring to the recent shuffle in the Union cabinet, Patole said there was a need to change the engine because merely changing bogies would not make any difference. “The time has come to change the engine. We are agitating for this change, which the country needs now. People are ruined because of the Modi government’s wrong policies,” Patole said, addressing a news conference in the city. He said the Congress leadership was capable of leading the country and being the engine of change. Patole said there was no dispute among his party leaders in connection with the Speaker’s post in the state assembly. A special session would have to be held to conduct the election of the Speaker, he said. The Congress leader said the possibilities of contesting the local self-governing bodies’ elections on own strength were being checked. “We are reviewing the situation. An appropriate decision would be taken at the appropriate time,” Patole said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/patole-blames-centre-policies-for-peoples-hardships/articleshow/84279634.cms||---

And besides the existing flyover, more space is required for the project’s expansion. The NMC needs to rehabilitate shopkeepers under the flyover in front of Tekdi Ganesh Temple and provide them land or money in exchange. The corporation has signed a 30-year lease agreement with them. Of which, 10 years have already passed. If these shopkeepers are to be removed now, they will have to be compensated,” said Gadkari.The meeting was attended by NMC commissioner Radhakrishnan B, Mahametro’s Brajesh Dixit, NIT chairman Manojkumar Suryavanshi, collector Ravindra Thakre and officials from various departments. Some officials suggested that a memorandum of understanding should be inked between the railways, NMC and PWD for the project.Discussions also took place on the minister’s dream project of the broad-gauge metro. Officials were informed that Kerala has already started work on the project.Gadkari also reviewed the Futala beautification project where a parking plaza and a four-storey building would be constructed along with a colourful fountain. Mahametro was asked to pay the land charges to NIT. While discussing another project of an agro convention centre at Dhaba, Gadkari directed the PWD to take possession of the 14,250 sq ft PDKV land where it was proposed to erect a fencing.During a review of the Kelibagh Road expansion, Gadkari was informed that out of 68 residential and commercial properties, 58 have been acquired, while the rest were mired in court proceedings. Gadkari asked the collector to start land acquisition by clearing dues of landowners. The administration informed him that the process would take about three months to complete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadkari-tells-nmc-to-handover-stn-road-beautification-project-to-metro/articleshow/84354634.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

This data would help the commission in case any assistance is required, at any time, especially in times of distress. In February 2020, the idea to construct a website with the provision to register was conceived,” said NRI commissioner Narendra Sawaikar. However, the work on the website was delayed due to the pandemic. Officials said that during times of distress, the relatives and near and dear ones of the persons working abroad are unable to provide required accurate details of the person in need of assistance. This delays the process of extending the required assistance to them. The registration available on the website is now expected to help overcome such issues and help the NRI commission provide help without delay, when required, they said. Approximately three lakh Goans are residing and working abroad, as per estimates of the NRI commission. There are around 18 associations of Goans in various countries. “The data registered on the website will help the commission in case of any eventualities. I appeal to the Goan diaspora and the seafarers to register themselves on the website. The information given will be protected and will not be available in public domain,” Sawaikar said. Director Anthony D’Souza and team will extend any support required in entering the data, he said. A team of Infotech Corporation of Goa, including Shweta Dalvi and Gaurav Naik, have designed the website. Goa government established a Commission for NRI Affairs as a separate entity on February 23, 2006, in view of the large Goan community living and working abroad. The data registered on the website will help the commission in case of any eventualities.

The recruitment had to be halted due to the economic impact of Covid-19 on the state’s finances. The process to recruit over 12,000 teachers in schools affiliated to the state board had begun in February 2019 through an online portal. Around 6,000 posts were filled. In May 2020, the state came out with a government resolution stalling all recruitments, including that of teachers. Last December, the state government excluded teachers from the recruitment ban. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad thanked CM Uddhav Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar for lifting the ban on teachers’ recruitments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-over-6000-teachers-to-be-recruited/articleshow/84279659.cms||---

He said the sugar industry in the state, which was on the verge of collapse, was revived because of the incentives and packages announced by the Centre. “The Union government had announced the minimum support price for sugar procurement, besides a package and incentives. It has now announced the ethanol policy, which will benefit the sugar mills in the state,” Fadnavis told a news conference here. On Union home minister Amit Shah leading the cooperation ministry as well, Fadnavis said, “H was active in the cooperative sector even before joining politics. He was among the leading names in Gujarat’s cooperative sector. Now if someone is worried about him taking over the ministry, we cannot do anything about it.” Maharashtra deputy chief minister, who was in the city for the weekly Covid meeting, said the cooperative sector had largely been a state subject. “It has to be seen what the Centre is planning to do with the cooperation department,” he said On the issue related to the political reservation of the OBC community, Fadnavis said, “The state government is buying time till the elections of the local self government bodies, scheduled in February 2022. The state tried to deflect the OBC reservation issue towards the Union government. But its attempt failed when we proved them wrong in the Assembly session. But in the process,12 of our MLAs were suspended,” . Fadnavis also said the state government should not shirk its responsibility in recruitments through the Maharashtra Public Service Commission and take steps to fill the posts in it. He said the MVA government should bring down the increasing taxes on fuels. “Our government had reduced the taxes, which led to the drop in fuel prices,” Fadnavis said. Pawar said, “We are following the same tax regime as that of the previous government. The Centre gets more share in terms of tax and should take a call on decreasing the fuel prices.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cooperation-ministry-will-benefit-state-says-fadnavis/articleshow/84279680.cms||---

Bhujbal, while speaking to the reporters after the covid review meeting, expressed concern for the farmers due to poor rainfall along with chances of water cuts. “The district has received very little rainfall when compared to the last year. If the situation continues to remain the same for some more time there will definitely be shortage of water. Hence, it is important to ensure judicious use of water,” Bhujbal said. He also asked civic chief Kailas Jadhav to review the situation and decide accordingly. The water reserved in Gangapur dam complex for NMC’s use is till August 15 and the current quantum that is available is sufficient for the citizens. “While the quota may be available, we have to be prepared for any situation if the rain fail for longer time. Hence, the commissioner should review the situation,” the guardian minister said. Bhujbal also asked elected representatives to think about the situation and allow water cuts. “There is no need to unnecessarily pressure the civic administration to not resort to water cuts. If the situation goes from bad to worse we will then have to fetch water from other areas by trains — just like it happened in Latur. Who will take up the responsibility then?” he asked. Talking about kharif crops, the guardian minster said farmers have been advised to delay sowing till there is sufficient rainfall. “While water remains an issue, we have ensured that seeds and fertilizers are well stacked at the distribution points and even delivered to the farmers. As soon as rain picks up, we will see the agriculture activity picking up. Till then we will have to wait,” he said Nashik district has received only 2,680 mm (18%) rainfall this year so far as against 5,097 mm (34%) during the same period last year. Niphad taluka has received highest 33% rainfall followed by Malegaon taluka with 30% showers so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/resort-to-water-cuts-if-necessary-bhujbal-tells-nashik-civic-body/articleshow/84275196.cms||---

Over 5,300 passengers have travelled in the city buses during the last two days. NMPML has collected a revenue of Rs 1.30 lakh in the last two days. Currently, 27 buses are plying along nine routes from two bus depots — Tapovan and Nashik Road — in Nashik city. A senior official told TOI, “On the first day, only 1,300 passengers travelled through NMPML buses and we got a revenue of Rs 28,000. But on Friday, the footfall of passengers increased three times. Over 4,000 passengers travelled in city buses on Friday and we collected revenue amounting to Rs 1.02 lakh.” The footfall of passengers will be rising as soon as more people get to know about the city bus service, he said. NMPML has developed an Intelligent Transport Management System (ITMS) through which the location of buses is tracked and the speed of the buses is controlled. People may book their tickets through a mobile app and know the nearby bus stop. The buses include CCTV cameras, panic buttons and announcements about the next stops. NMC has deployed two private firms for procurement, operation, maintenance and management bases, while NMC will pay both the firms on a per km basis. These two firms have altogether procured 250 buses, including 200 CNG and 50 diesel buses. These two firms are Pune-based M/s Travel Time Car Rental Pvt Ltd and Delhi-based M/s City Life Line Travels Pvt Ltd. Manoj Patil, the project manager of M/s Travel Time Car Rental, said the buses plied on time and the footfall of passengers is also increasing. Akash Koshire, a city resident, who travelled from Ashok Nagar to Central Bus Stand, said that he had a good experience travelling in the city bus.“I was not aware of the bus service, but I saw it when I was looking for a rickshaw at the bus stop in Ashok Nagar. The bus fare was also comparatively lower than the rickshaw fare,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmcs-new-buses-receive-overwhelming-response/articleshow/84275217.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Slum dwellers on Nepean Sea plot oppose builder’s plan||MUMBAI: A day after TOI reported on the dereservation of a Nepean Sea Road plot, slum residents on the property said they have passed a resolution to remove the builder for non-performance. They want to redevelop the slum under a self-redevelopment scheme. Residents of the Simla Nagar slum, located on a vantage plot near Hanging Garden at Malabar hills, held a public general meeting early this year and resolved to opt for self-redevelopment. Krishna Parte, chief promoter of the Simla Nagar Swayamvikas Cooperative Housing Society, said the residents have waited since 2004 for the builder, Esarac Construction, to redevelop the slum. The construction firm is promoted by Rajat Patel, Danish Merchant and Mukesh Talreja. Parte said the proposed housing society has support of around 300 of 697 families residing on the 2.5-acre plot, which was earlier reserved for a garden/park and green belt. The Maharashtra urban development department deleted the reservations in April, allowing the plot to be used for construction. Deletion of reservation means no portion of this prime land will be utilized as a public open space. “Despite sending the resolution for self-redevelopment and successive reminders since past six months, the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) has failed to do anything. We may be forced to approach the court to expedite our case,” said Parte. Builder Danish Merchant, one of the partners of Esarac Construction, told TOI that he was aware that slum dwellers want to undertake self-redevelopment. “Let the SRA decide on their proposal,’’ he said. According to him, the reservation has not been deleted by the government. “We wanted this green belt reservation to be deleted because it covers 30% of the plot. If we cannot build on that portion the redevelopment becomes unfeasible for us,” said Merchant. The notification of April 2021 said the plot is reserved for government staff quarters. Property experts said the nomenclature “government staff quarters’’ means the plot controlled by Esarac Construction can be exploited by the developer for a slum rehabilitation scheme. “An SRA project here means this green slope suddenly has a development potential of at least Rs 2,000 crore,’’ they said. The proposal to remove the reservation was mooted when the BJP government was in power in 2018. It was finally sanctioned early this year under the current Sena-led MVA alliance. Sena leader Eknath Shinde is the state urban development minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-slum-dwellers-on-nepean-sea-plot-oppose-bldrs-plan/articleshow/84283579.cms||Nauzer Bharucha
---||Delhi||Govt survey to identify Covid orphans in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi government’s women and child development (WCD) department will undertake a survey to identify children who have been orphaned during the coronavirus pandemic. The department said it has appointed 20 welfare officers who will conduct the survey in different childcare homes, institutions and district offices in the city. The officers have been attached with child welfare committees and district child protection units to conduct the survey by July 20, it said. Delhi government has planned to give a compensation of Rs 2,500 per month to children who have lost their parents to Covid-19. Over 2,000 children in the city have lost either one or both their parents to Covid-19, with 67 of them losing both their parents, since the pandemic outbreak in March last year, according to a survey conducted by Delhi Commission For Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR). As many as 651 children have lost their mothers and 1,311 children lost their fathers to the infection, it stated. The commission had said details of these children have been shared with WCD department for necessary action on its part to enrol eligible beneficiaries. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had on May 14 said his government would bear the cost of education and upbringing of the children orphaned during the pandemic.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi had last month announced a number of welfare measures for such children, including ensuring a corpus of Rs 10 lakh when they turn 23 years of age and providing for their education.

---||Kolkata||ICMAI grads land jobs with 43% higher pay than last year||KOLKATA: A bunch of final-year cost and management accountancy students from ICMAI have bagged record offers in the online campus placement drive this year, the average salary rise being 43% compared to the packages last year. This, despite the pandemic that has led to largescale pay-cuts, layoffs and frozen employment across industries. Around 500 out of 2,000-odd students have already secured jobs at bluechip companies, such as Accenture, Goldman Sachs, Wipro, TCS, Philips, L&T, Capgemini, CITCO, ITC, CEAT and Nestle, along with PSUs like GAIL, NBCC, Powergrid, ITDC, IRCON and HSCC. More companies, like Deloitte, KPMG, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra, are scheduled to hold interviews. The highest pay packages secured by five students have been in the range of Rs 22 lakh per annum, while the average salary on offer was Rs 10 lakh a year. In 2020, the average pay package was around Rs 7 lakh per annum. “I bagged a job at Accenture in Bangalore in the very first interview. The institute has made me on a par with students of some of the best management and engineering institutes in the country,” said Indranil Banerjee (24), who did his graduation from an Asansol college. Headquartered on Sudder Street in Kolkata, the Institute of Cost Accountants of India (ICMAI) is a premier statutory professional accountancy body under an Act of Parliament and is the largest cost and management accounting body in Asia and the second largest in the world. “During the pandemic, companies are sacking employees and adopting cost-reduction methods for which cost and management accountants play a key role. So, there has been a spurt in demand of cost and management accountants,” said Debaprosanna Nandy, senior director, (studies, training, placement and advanced studies), ICMAI. An ICMAI official pointed out they upgraded the online education system over the past year and arranged for skill training programmes, including compulsory SAP training, Microsoft education, e-filing and Cambridge University soft skill programme for no additional cost. Officials believe these added skills and the closure of several private engineering colleges acted as a catalyst for the robust placement drive. The first phase of online campus placement for the December 2020 batch was held in May and the second phase is now on. Officials plan to carry it on till October. “We are pleased with the response from the corporates. A number of PSUs and Indian and global companies are hiring. It’s a positive sign the companies are recognizing the importance of CMA professionals in the changing business scenario,” said Biswarup Basu, president, ICMAI. “The institute plans an overseas placement drive soon,” said Balwinder Singh, a former president and chairman of ICMAI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/icmai-grads-land-jobs-with-43-higher-pay-than-last-yr/articleshow/84279702.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

They said commencing and concluding trial in the money laundering cases without completing the trial in the scheduled offences would adversely affect them. They told this to Justice Shameem Akther who was hearing similar petitions filed by several accused firms in the quid pro case. Senior counsel S Niranjan Reddy, who appeared for these firms, said the CBI court had earlier held that it would hold a simultaneous trial in both matters. “Though the court has no power to review its earlier order, it is refusing our requests for a simultaneous trial,” he said. He said the money laundering offence was predicated on an allegation of someone trying to pass off proceeds of crime as clean money. “Therefore, there has to be firstly an earlier crime and secondly, such crime must result in a benefit or what is legally called proceeds of crime. If such proceeds of crime are thereafter sought to be passed off as clean money, then a new offence of money laundering is capable of being alleged,” the senior counsel explained. Niranjan further said: “For deciding and holding that any person is guilty of money laundering, there has to be a scheduled offence that must be tried first or at least it can be tried simultaneously with the ED case that deals with money laundering.” Money laundering offence cannot be tried first, while carrying out trial in the ED case first would result in miscarriage of justice, he said. “If trial court concludes there is no crime at all in the CBI case, then the question of dealing with ED’s proceeds of crime does not arise,” he said. Without realising this position in law, the special court had directed that money laundering offence will be tried first, he said and urged the high court to correct the situation by using its inherent powers under Section 482 of CrPC. Additional solicitor general T Surya Karan Reddy said they will file written submissions clarifying the legal position in this regard. But, he insisted that the ongoing process before the trial court need not be stopped. The judge, while seeking written submissions from all parties, adjourned the case to two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hold-trial-in-cbi-ed-cases-jointly-jagathi-to-hc/articleshow/84279760.cms||---

Of the 96,000 seats in Maharashtra, only 40,000 seats were confirmed by Friday. The state education department is likely to send fresh allotments to applicants on the waiting list. This year, the number of seats were also reduced under the scheme as against previous years, when the number crossed 1 lakh. The admission process was conducted between June 11 and June 30. It was later decided to extend the deadline until July 9. However, the extension did not help boost admissions under RTE. Dinkar Temkar, in-charge of RTE admissions in Maharashtra, said, “The confirmation has been very slow this time because of the pandemic. Many parents, especially from the lower economic strata, have gone to their hometowns and they have refrained from confirming admissions since classes are being conducted online. We may give a chance to applicants on the wait list if they meet the criteria. The decision shall be announced in the coming few days.” RTE admissions are conducted at 9,432 schools across Maharashtra. The lottery was announced in March, when 82,129 admissions were allotted. After restrictions related to the pandemic were relaxed, the process of admission continued until June 30 and later the date was extended till July 9. Among all districts in the state, Pune has had highest number of confirmations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nearly-60-rte-seats-vacant-on-last-day-of-confirmation/articleshow/84279743.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Colleges unsure of finishing admissions in eight weeks||KOLKATA: After the government announced that no admission test or interview could be held for undergraduation admissions and that first-semester classes should begin on October 1, principals of different colleges in the city seemed doubtful about how to wrap up the entire process within the stipulated eight weeks. They seemed worried as last year, too, candidates had to be taken in based on their Class XII boards marks and that led to the process dragging on for six months. According to principals, most institutes struggled to fill their seats, forcing the government to extend the UG entrance deadline several times. This consequently pushed back the beginning of first-semester classes, leaving students and teachers with less time to cover the syllabus. The state government on Wednesday instructed universities and colleges here to invite admission applications by August 20 and publish the merit list by August 31. The admissions should be over by the end of September and classes are supposed to begin on October1. “The government has set a time frame for every aspect of the admission process but the real situation unfolds in a very different way,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college. On-campus classes have been suspended since March last year due to the pandemic. Admissions to UG and PG courses last year were conducted online. The colleges started inviting applications in the second week of August and though classes began in the third week of December, admissions continued till January this year because a large number of seats remained vacant in most colleges. This happened because candidates, on scoring high due to “Covid calculations” applied to every subject they made it to the cut-offs and then, did not take admissions in subjects they did not have aptitude for. Even Presidency University and Jadavpur University struggled to fill up seats in several departments, some of them sought after. “Several candidates made it to the merit list in subjects they did not want to pursue. This resulted in a large number of empty seats in colleges across the city. To fill up those seats, colleges opened their admission portal several times. This resulted in a delay in starting the academic session,” said the principal of north Kolkata college. To expedite the process, college authorities want the government to open the campuses and allow teaching and non-teaching staff to attend work so that several back-end work related to admissions can be completed. “We have to hold several meetings and process different systems for which the teaching and non-teaching staff are required on the campus. Certain decisions have to be taken for which everybody’s opinion is required. But due to the pandemic, we can only work with a handful of staff members which can delay the work,” said a principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-unsure-of-finishing-admissions-in-8-weeks/articleshow/84279755.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Goa||GCCI: Restart loan settlement scheme for mining affected||Panaji: Goa Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI) has asked the state government to consider extending the One Time Settlement scheme (OTS) for mining affected borrowers, which expired in March. The GCCI, which met cooperation minister Govind Gaude on Friday said that cooperative banks and societies should be included in the scheme. A team from GCCI met Gaude at the secretariat and submitted a representation for extending the OTS scheme, which was introduced in 2014 to help clear bank loans of people dependent on Goa’s iron ore mining industry. Though the initial response was poor, the scheme helped 4,574 mining affected to settle their loans with Rs 98.6 crore disbursed through the Economic Development Corporation (EDC). “Many cases are still pending from loans taken from cooperative banks and credit societies which are reluctant to waive off part of the loans,” GCCI treasurer Chandrakant Gawas said. As per the debt relief scheme, a subsidy up to 35% on the total loan settlement amount was provided. Banks and financial institutions granted a waiver of 100% loan interest from September 2012, 40% waiver on principle loan amount for trucks owners and 30% to barge owners. The loans of approximately 8,000 truck owners, barge owners and machinery owners had turned into non-performing assets after the abrupt closure of Goa’s mining sector in September 2012, and the state government had estimated the total loan exposure of the mining dependant people to be about Rs 1,000 crore. Gaude assured the delegation that the matter will be “sorted out” with the cooperative banks and the registrar of cooperative societies. The minister said that will discuss the possibility of extending the OTS scheme with chief minister Pramod Sawant. Goa Chamber was represented by Gawas and director Sanjay Amonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gcci-restart-loan-settlement-scheme-for-mining-affected/articleshow/84281892.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A senior civic official said they will conduct a probe to check if this was in violation of the municipal service rules—relatives of employees are not supposed to bag civic contracts to prevent any conflict of interest. The official added that the preliminary enquiry report will reveal if the employees had helped their spouses’ firms bag the contracts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-probe-into-firms-of-2-staffers-wives/articleshow/84283608.cms||---
---||Delhi||PM2.5 takes greater toll in winter: Study by IIT-Delhi||NEW DELHI: A study conducted by IIT-Delhi has revealed that there is a 0.52% increase in non-trauma all-cause mortality for every 10 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) rise in short-term PM2.5 exposure (six days) in Delhi. The impact of PM2.5 is almost two-fold higher in winter than summer. Track the pollution level in your cityPublished in the peer-reviewed journal Atmospheric Environment, the study stated that the impact was higher in men (0.57%) than women (0.52%) in Delhi. “The impact was higher in winter than summer due to combined factors like meteorological, locational and anthropogenic. Winter witnesses the highest PM2.5 peaks due to long episodes of poor air quality,” said Dr Pallavi Joshi, Centre of Atmospheric Sciences, IIT-Delhi, one of the researchers of the study. “According to WHO guidelines, the annual average should be 10 µg/m3, whereas in Delhi the median value was 108 µg/m3,” added Joshi. The other researchers were Sagnik Dey from Centre of Excellence for Research on Clean Air, Kuldeep Dixit and Rohit Kumar Choudhary from IIT-Delhi, Santu Ghosh from St John’s Medical College, Bengaluru, Harshal Ramesh Salve from AIIMS and Kalpana Balakrishnan from Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Chennai. The impact of acute exposure to PM2.5 on all-cause mortality was larger than that of PM10 exposure. “This was the first such attempt in estimating the effect of acute exposure to PM2.5 on daily mortality in India using satellite-based exposure data. Our study estimates that PM2.5 exposure was three times higher than the previous effect estimates for PM10 exposure in Delhi done in the past,” said one of the researchers. The study used city-level daily average PM2.5 concentration to estimate the acute effects of ambient exposure on daily all-cause non-trauma mortality in Delhi from 2013-2017. In terms of meteorological conditions, the daily average temperature during the study period ranged from 7.9 to 39.9 degrees Celsius, while relative humidity was from 20.2% to 99.4%. The daily mortality data was collected from the headquarters of the corporations in Delhi. The data suggested that interventions during the peak season can result in substantial health benefits. Policymakers can use it to undertake various mitigation measures under the National Clean Air Programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pm2-5-takes-greater-toll-in-winter-study/articleshow/84279902.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Executive engineer Rajesh Bhutkar fled the office after being informed about irked citizens storming the zone office. According to residents, there was no problem of waterlogging and rainwater entering their houses till the road was tarred. Since it was concretized this year, Old Subhedar area residents faced rainwater entering their homes. After analyzing the infrastructure work, residents found that the level of the road was increased and so was the stormwater inlet. The level was more than the level of their homes along the road, leading to rainwater entering their homes, said the corporator. On June 28, the day when rainwater entered their homes, residents tried to contact executive engineer Bhutkar who had supervised the cement road work. “Despite making at least 40 phone calls, we failed to reach the executive engineer,” said Parshu Thakur. Later, a delegation of residents led by Thakur met assistant municipal commissioner of Hanuman Nagar zone Sushma Mandge and submitted a memorandum demanding immediate measures to improve the stormwater network in Old Subhedar area. The residents were assured that the executive engineer will visit the locality and review the situation. Even after 10 days, Bhutkar has neither visited the locality nor has he taken any corrective measures. After Thursday’s incessant rain, at least 100 houses alongside the cement road were submerged. On Thursday, too, residents tried to call Bhutkar who asked them to visit the zone office on Friday morning, said local resident Gajanan Bhandarke. When residents went there, Bhutkar fled from the rear gate of the zone office, claimed the other residents — Amit Desai, Suraj Chandel and Jayant Desai. Thakur then informed mayor Dayashankar Tiwari who swiftly responded to the residents’ grievance and directed Bhutkar to reach the spot. Soon, Bhutkar reached Old Subhedar layout. The mayor too visited the locality. After inspecting the site, the mayor directed Bhutkar to lay another stormwater network in front of houses by maintaining its level so that rainwater does not enter their homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/irked-residents-storm-nmc-zonal-office-exec-engr-flees/articleshow/84277684.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The board is working its formula on the marks that the schools have sent to finalize the boards scores, but it has decided to carry out surprise visits to schools from Monday to check their honesty. The exam scripts for classes IX and XI are hard copies and for X and XII, it is scanned pdfs that the students sent after their online exams. Many schools took pre-board exams on campus and for them, too, the answer scripts are hard copies. “Everything is preserved for every child. We welcome the random checks,” said Lakshmipat Singhania Academy director Meena Kak. Some school heads felt the “visitors” would also see the question paper standard. “The question paper standard is important as kids from different schools are being judged on the same anvil. It will help the board draw up the school average,” said Rita Chatterjee, director of North Point Boarding School. “Surprise checks are needed to ensure there is no foul play,” said Vijaylakshmi Kumar, Asian International School principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbse-may-pay-surprise-visit-to-schools-over-marks/articleshow/84279819.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Extend business timings till 8pm, Nagpur district collector writes to state government||NAGPUR: Citing very low Covid-19 weekly test positivity rate (TPR), occupancy of oxygen beds and active cases, collector Ravindra Thakare has requested the state government to allow majority of business activities in the district up to 8pm as against existing deadline of 4pm. On Friday, the collector’s office and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) issued notifications for implementing revised restrictions and relaxations from July 12, Monday. Both Thakare and municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B have allowed takeaway, parcel, home delivery from restaurants after 4pm and outdoor sports activities from 5am to 9am and 6pm to 9pm. The decisions were taken in the meeting of district disaster management authority (DDMA) held on Friday. Later, Thakare sent a letter to principal secretary of disaster management, relief and rehabilitation department. In the letter, Thakare has mentioned that district’s TPR of last week ending on July 8 was 0.46% while oxygen bed occupancy was 0.68% on July 4. Based on the two criterion, the district falls under Level 1, yet the government had placed it under Level 3. Citing complaints from various associations that Level 3 restrictions are hampering the business and economy, Thakare stated that all DDMA members unanimously decided to urge the government to increase the timing up to 8pm. Thakare also proposed to increase timings of restaurants up to 10pm and sought permission to resume offline meetings of public representatives with 50% capacity. But he has not asked for permission to keep non-essential shops and restaurants open on weekends. The state had directed the authorities to seek permission in case there is demand for increasing relaxations. In view of suggestion from CP Amitesh Kumar, the civic chief and collector had on July 5 issued orders not to allow takeaway/parcel from restaurants after 4pm and outdoor sports activities after 9am. The CP’s idea was to prevent people from roaming in the city after 4pm and restrict free movement of people (excluding medical and emergency) after 5pm. These orders were to be in force till July 11. But within a week, the orders were revised after consultation with Kumar. “This was done because weekly TPR is less and business of restaurants was badly affected,” said an official. In case there is no communication from government or Thakare’s proposal is rejected, essential, non-essential shops and other permissible activities will continue up to 4pm even as cases district is reporting very few cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/extend-biz-timings-till-8pm-dist-collector-writes-to-state-govt/articleshow/84277704.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The F&CC gave Rs 7 crore for development and repair works of Industrial Area, Phases 8A and 8B besides outdoor gyms in Sectors 76 to 80. These industrial areas have been taken over by the municipal corporation from PSIEC. Also, a new bathroom has been sanctioned in Rose Garden, said mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu alias Jeeti Sidhu. He said that resolutions have been passed in the meeting mainly related to road repair and premix, paver block works, street light and horticulture. “Our aim is purely development of the city without any deviation,” he said. Deputy mayor Kuljit Singh Bedi said that by convening this meeting and passing resolutions, mayor Amarjit Singh Jeeti Sidhu had given an answer to the opposition. The opposition had alleged that the mayor would not be able to pass any resolution in the F&CC unless they were passed in the House. Bedi said, “Mayor Jeeti Sidhu had said in a press conference that the Finance and Contracts Committee would continue to function as per the rules and he would convene a meeting soon. Today, he convened a meeting and passed a resolution worth about Rs 20 crore, giving a clear answer to the opposition.” In addition, a video conferencing room is to be set up in the Municipal Corporation Building, Sector 68 and a new bathroom is to be constructed in Rose Garden of Phase 3B1.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Sharp rise in ‘neighbourhood brawls’ post 4pm restriction||NAGPUR: The city police control room is flooded with calls reporting quarrels or brawls in neighbourhoods, especially slums, after the 4pm restriction. Prank calls too have increased manifold. While city police chief Amitesh Kumar sounded concerned, psychiatrist, Dr Rajesh Rathi, termed it as a ‘lockdown effect’. Kumar has already had a brainstorming session with his senior officers over reasons behind the spurt in violence, means to curb it and create a fear of law in the society. “We are pondering over the reasons whether it’s the ample free time that citizens are getting after the 4pm restrictions leading to their early return from work or frustration over restrictions or some other reasons,” said Kumar. The city has also witnessed a spate of violent crimes like murders in the evening, including the latest one at Pandhrabodhi a couple of days ago. On Thursday, too, there was an incident of stabbing in Sadar. As the CP is trying to meet the tricky challenge by deploying some measures like ensuring DCP level officers monitor calls regarding fights coming to the control room between 6pm and 11pm, Dr Rathi suggested that the men in khaki should immediately identify ‘high risk zones’ or ‘violence-prone localities’ to start ‘a good hope’ campaign focusing on mental health issues of citizens plagued by lockdown worries and anxieties, including financial stress. Kumar said multiple calls of fighting incessantly coming to the control room is leaving officers clueless as to how to tackle the problems at different localities simultaneously. “We are ensuring cross-jurisdiction policing by diversion of forces from different police stations to attend spots from where the calls had come. Apart from a prompt response, we also don’t want our cops to get outnumbered and aggravate the situation,” said the CP, adding, “co-ordination of diversion of forces is done by the DCPs.” Kumar said most of the fights or quarrels are due to trivial reasons. “We are taking action against criminals but this increased violence is leaving us concerned,” he said. Dr Rathi said his association of experts is ready to render help through a helpline so that people can overcome stress, anxiety and depression.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sharp-rise-in-neighbourhood-brawls-post-4pm-restriction/articleshow/84277713.cms||Soumitra Bose

Sources told TOI that Dr Archana Patil, director of the state’s health services, on her visit to the district on Friday, stated that the supply of vaccine is likely to be streamlined in August. In a press release issued on Friday, CEO of ZP Yogesh Kumbhejkar, said, “Due to the probable third wave, the State Task Force (STF) has suggested special preference for diagnosis and treatment of children. It will be easy and helpful if their mothers are vaccinated. We conducted a survey and found that rural areas comprise 2.14 lakh children between the age groups of 0-13 years. We will vaccinate all these mothers on a priority basis.” The ZP has assigned ASHA workers to visit all villages and towns and prepare the list of 2.14 lakh mothers. Registration and vaccination of these mothers started at some centres a couple of days ago. ASHA workers will meet these mothers in a phased manner to ensure their registration and vaccination. The ZP is of the view that a few from these 2.14 lakh mothers may have taken the dose. “Nearly 8,80,919 women have taken the jab in the district. Almost 18,41,904 people from the district have been vaccinated — 14,15,505 (first dose) and 4,26,399 (second dose),” said Kumbhejkar. The ZP had taken various initiatives for vaccinating as many people as possible in rural areas of the district. ‘Vaccination At Your Village’ got a good response. Dr Patil visited some districts of Vidarbha for the proposed filaria eradication programme. She held a meeting with officials of the state’s public health department, ZP and the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). Sources from the NMC and PHD said, “Officials informed Dr Patil about the problems being faced by people due to the irregular supply of the vaccine. She said that all the states are taking up the same issue with the Central government and added that there were chances that the supply of vaccines will be streamlined in August.” Going by Dr Patil’s interaction with officials, it seems that vaccine supply will continue to take a hit till the end of July. The demand is high since the resumption of inoculation for the 18-44 age group on June 23. Vaccination could not be carried out in NMC’s 136 out of the 138 free-of-cost Covishield centres on Friday. It was the second consecutive day when vaccination was not available for the 18-44 group. Meanwhile, inoculation for the 45-plus category resumed a day ago. There will be no vaccination at NMC’s 136 free-of-cost Covishield centres on Saturday. Vaccination will continue in four Covaxin centres of the NMC for the 18-plus on Saturday. Fresh stock is expected by Saturday evening and inoculation is set to resume on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/priority-vax-to-moms-of-2-14-lakh-0-13-age-group-kids-in-rural-areas/articleshow/84277750.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The completion of the task took almost a year. Those who got back their phones, cumulatively worth Rs 37.5 lakh, included senior citizens, students and home makers. At a programme held at Alankar Hall at the police headquarters, city police chief Amitesh Kumar, who handed over some of the cellphones, said the cyber cell has the potential to take on the challenges of rising online criminal activities. “We have the capacity of prevention and detection with a proven track record of cracking some crucial cases and busting gangs like the Nigerian one from Delhi,” said Kumar, cautioning citizens against sharing passwords and OTPs. The CP was accompanied by additional CPs Sunil Phulari, Navinchandra Reddy, DCP Vivek Masaal and senior PI Ashok Bagul of the cyber police station. “While the cyber cell is the nodal agency, units in every police station too can proactively address people’s grievances,” he said. The track record of people from whom the missing mobile phones were traced are being verified and action would be taken if they are found to be involved in unlawful activities. “The police would track people with a dubious track record of dealing in stolen mobile phones and act accordingly,” he said.

The next day he cremated the body on the village outskirts and he was helped by four other persons too in concealing the crime. “We received tip-off that the duo had an argument over suspicion of extra-marital affair. Suspecting foul play, we exhumed the dead body on July 6,” said R N Khant, police inspector at Khambhat rural police station. “As the body was decomposed, a panel of forensic experts at Karamsad Hospital conducted the postmortem which revealed that she had died due to severe injuries on her head and chest,” he said. “Her husband had passed off the murder as a natural death caused due to heart attack. Since, four others had helped in cremating the dead body, we have arrested them as well,” he said. The couple’s 15-year-old son has been made witness in the crime. The husband and the others who helped him were arrested by police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/dead-woman-detected-killed/articleshow/84280163.cms||---

Estimated to cost Rs1,350 crore, the highway will connect Kalmeshwar and terminate at Katol. The highway is one of the major links connecting Nagpur-Katol–Warud-Amravati and further Madhya Pradesh. The highway (NH-353J) starts 13km from the Zero Mile near Fetri T-point junction. The 5km bottleneck between Katol Naka and Fetri will be left out if the road starts from the outer ring road. NHAI project director Abhijeet Jichkar says, “The said road stretch will be treated a one-time improvement as per extant policy. The 13km stretch will be handled in the second phase. The project is divided into two phases. The first phase is designed keeping in view that the highway traffic would ply up to the outer ring road (ORR) and then follow it without entering the city.” Jichkar said, “An Aurangabad agency has been finalized to complete the project after tendering process. We are complying with conditions prescribed in stage-I and have deposited net present value (NPV) for over 14 hectare forest land diversion.” Jichkar said, “The road from Katol has already been widened to four-lane. The road is predominantly orange-producing belt and will help the orange industry. Up gradation of existing two-lane road to four-lane with paved shoulders will facilitate better transportation in terms of fast, congestion-free movement of traffic and will also ensure improvement in people-to-people contact in nearby towns.” The national highway connects three state highways — Karanja-Mowad-Bangaon (SH 245), Wardha-Pulgaon-Malegaon (SH 244) and Morshi-Pandhurna (MSH 10). These state highways are a link for interstate connectivity to Maharashtra and MP. On stage-II clearance, Jichkar says, “Once we comply with stage-I conditions, we will get working permission wherein the user agency can start work on the project. We have already deposited money towards compensatory afforestation and NPV for land diverted.” “We have also received a clearance certificate under Forest Rights Act (FRA) from the district collector for land which will be diverted for the project. Besides, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has also issued NOC,” Jichkar added. The road widening will lead to felling of over 3,300 big trees. The NHAI will take up compensatory afforestation on over 28 hectare in Bramhni and Dawha villages in Umred. The authority has already deposited over Rs3.28 crore for afforestation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-stage-i-nod-work-to-start-on-nagpur-katol-highway/articleshow/84277760.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Jaipur||Transfer certificates not required in Rajasthan government schools for admission||JAIPUR: Directorate of school education, Bikaner has issued order that no student will need to submit a transfer certificate (TC) to get admission in government schools. The order is applicable for students studying in Classes I to VIII. This order is being opposed by private schools, who have threatened to go on strike. The order states that the students should not be barred from education at any cost and they should be allowed to study in class provisionally. The private schools are saying that this will badly impact them as children amid pandemic will just leave schools without paying fees and get admission in government schools. Reacting to this, director of secondary education, Sourabh Swami said, “We will take documents from students afterwards but for the time being they will be given provisional admissions as many parents are in distress. Many private schools are not giving online classes but are charging full fees. Hence, to give them relief we will give such parents some relief which is provided under RTE.” Anil Sharma, president of School Shiksha Pariwar, said, “This is sheer injustice towards us as this will completely ruin us. Now, any parent can just stop paying the fees, get admission for their kid in a government school and when the situation becomes normal, they will take Transfer Certificate from the government school and return to the private schools. If the government doesn’t take it back, we will sit on a protest in front of governor’s house.” According to the private school association, anyway small classes are easier to teach and with lockdown, many parents are reluctant to pay the fees. Hence, they feel this order will create more problems. Another point put forward by the private schools was that on April 9, 2020, the government itself issued order that any parent who wants to leave schools with transfer certificate, have to clear the due fees. Principal of a private school on condition of anonymity said, “Around 20% parents are yet to pay fees of last session. Government’s decision will negatively impact us, especially private schools that are not very economically well-off. We will be completely ruined amid the pandemic. Government needs to change the order.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/transfer-certificates-not-required-in-govt-schools-for-admission/articleshow/84281963.cms||---

The woman, Jyoti Kamble, and jeweller, Sudanshu Praminik (43), were treated for burn injuries. Police said the accused, Prabodh Kamble (45), was upset with Jyoti for taking up employment with Praminik. The Kambles live in a joint family in Munir Bashir Chawl at Parsiwadi in Ghatkopar. On Wednesday, Kamble reached the jewellery shop and flung acid at Jyoti’s face, a police officer said. Praminik, who was standing nearby, sustained burn injuries on his hands and legs. The duo was rushed to a nearby hospital. They were discharged on Thursday. A senior police officer said that they have sent the acid for chemical analysis.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Post-Covid symptoms last for two months in many patients||JAIPUR: During the first wave, the post-Covid 19 symptoms lasted for a fortnight or a month, but in the second wave, the symptoms are lasting for more than two months. Patients, who got their report negative in May, are still going through post-Covid symptoms like elevated sugar level, lethargy, lung related issues and brain fog. Core team of Covid-19 care and management in the state on Friday said that these patients need to regularly visit doctors to follow their medication and should maintain a healthy lifestyle to overcome the symptoms. “Yes, it is seen that many patients are getting post Covid symptoms lasting for two months and more. We are still getting patients having elevated sugar levels, heartbeat, lung related issues and even brain fog. These patients are advised to continue their visit to their doctors and follow medication as advised to them. Also, in order to ensure their sugar levels may not shoot up further, they should maintain a healthy life style. Also they should have disciplined food habits and should indulge in some physical activity,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College who also heads the Covid care and management team in the state while talking to TOI. Patients getting prolonged post-Covid symptoms are also confused and worried about their health. “I start gasping while I walk. I was Covid negative on May 12. Doctors stated that there are still some issues left in my lungs. I have also been advised some physiotherapy of the lungs which I am following,” said Mukesh Agarwal a chartered accountant who had HRCT score of 18 and remained in hospital for a month. Dr Ajeet Singh, superintendent of RUHS, said, “It is surprising that many patients who got their report negative during first week of May are still getting post-Covid symptoms. Those who have badly damaged their lungs will have to be extra careful while other symptoms like brain fog, lethargy and elevated sugar levels will gradually subside.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/post-covid-symptoms-last-for-two-months-in-many-patients/articleshow/84281987.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Goa||Margao’s parking plan to be revived||Margao: The Margao Municipal Council (MMC) at its meeting on Friday decided to revive the proposed multi-level parking project that has been lying in limbo for the last several years. The municipality will float tenders for the project afresh, the estimated cost of which is now tagged at nearly Rs 10 crore, an almost 80% rise from the earlier estimated cost of Rs 5.6 crore when it was last put to tender three years ago. The proposed project has been trapped in a web of bureaucratic tangles and tendering issues over the last few years. As per the original proposal, the Rs 3 crore that the MMC had received from the government as golden jubilee grants on the occasion of the state’s 50th year of Liberation in 2011 will be utilised for the project, while the rest of the cost will be sourced from MMC’s coffers. MMC chief officer Agnelo Fernandes said that the Rs 3 crore parked in the bank over the last nine years has accrued an interest of Rs 2.5 crore. “The government has sanctioned the amount for the remainder of the estimated cost of the project,” he said. The MMC also approved the proposal mooted by the Goa State Pollution Control Board to rope in an experienced private agency to handle the daily incoming wet waste at Sonsoddo. “Expressions of interest (EoI) for the purpose will be invited by the municipality from interested agencies soon,” Fernandes said. It also approved the proposal for setting up a 50 TPD capacity biomethanation plant at Sonsoddo, as was decided by the High Powered Coordination Committee (HPCC) on Sonsoddo. Tenders for the project are likely to be invited by the MMC after monsoons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/margaos-parking-plan-to-be-revived/articleshow/84282088.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Rise in raw material prices may lead to costlier homes: Builders||NAGPUR: Home buying may get costlier in the coming days, say builders as they may have to finally pass on the increase in cost of construction material to the buyers. This may happen in the fresh bookings of ongoing projects as a number of new plans have been held up due to the rising cost, said local builders at a press conference organized by the Nagpur branch of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai). The costs of building material across the board have gone up since lockdown, they said. Credai Nagpur president Vijay Dargan of M/s Nithyam Construction said there had been a “steady increase in the rate of construction material” since lockdown. This has led to an increase in the cost of construction by Rs300 per square feet. Dargan added that future buyers may have to bear the increased cost, as a 10-15% rise in the selling price can be expected across projects. Builders also pointed towards a likely cartelization in some of the items, saying that the rates had been increased together by all the manufacturers even if there was no corresponding increase in the demand. Credai Nagpur joint secretaries Pratish Gujarati of M/s Pratish Buildcon and Vijay Joshi of M/s J K Builders said rates of steel that were at Rs40,000 a ton had reached Rs60,000 since January. A bag of cement that cost Rs280 is now up by Rs100. They added, “Even the rates of PVC pipes have gone up by Rs500. As against Rs950-1,000 a unit, the pipes now cost Rs1,400-1,500. There has been an increase in the rates of sand and a host of sundry items too.” This is expected to take the cost of construction to Rs1,800 a square feet, as against the regular average of Rs1,500 a square feet so far. For the existing bookings, builders may manage with the inventory but for fresh buyers, the rate may be hiked, said the builders. “At present, the entry level rates of a 900-1,000 square feet flat in the city are in the range of Rs30 lakh. The price may go up to Rs33-34 lakh if the hike continues,” said Joshi. There would be a similar impact on the higher-priced properties also. A committee of Credai will be compiling details of fresh projects that have started in Nagpur to assess the impact of rise in cost of construction material. The builders have questioned the logic behind increase in steel and cement rates. If it is being attributed to increase in infrastructure activities across the country, that started five years ago and a new price equilibrium was already reached. There is little reason for prices to increase when real estate activity is at a low due to the pandemic, said the realtors. ‘Big jump in wages due to labour scarcity’ Shortage of labourers due to their reverse migration to homes following the lockdown has led to an increase in wages. Evens as workers have returned, there remains a shortage. This has led to an increase in the wages by nearly double, said builders at the Credai press conference. Earlier, a pair of skilled and unskilled workers like a mason and helper needed to be paid Rs700-800. This has gone up by Rs 1,000-1,100, builders claimed. Construction workers at sites in Nagpur mainly come from the neighbouring Chhattisgarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rise-in-raw-material-prices-may-lead-to-costlier-homes-builders/articleshow/84277779.cms||Shishir Arya

Speaking to TOI, Vimala said, “This will be my first posting in Nagpur and I look forward to it.” She is currently the chief executive officer of the Maharashtra State Rural Livelihoods Mission (MSRLM). When asked what her priorities will be upon taking charge, Vimala said, “I would like to take a call on that after meeting with officials and discussing what our priorities are.” Hailing from Bhusawal, Vimala was a Std XII merit student and also one of the toppers at university. Starting her career as a lecturer, she later shifted to public service. Vimala’s attempts to crack the UPSC exam were unsuccessful, but she did not let the temporary setback get her down. An acquaintance suggested that she must appear for MPSC exams. Not having studied Marathi since Std VII, appearing for a Marathi language theory paper was a daunting task for the Tamil-speaking Vimala. But within three months, she mastered the language enough to score over 80 marks (out of 100) in that paper. Later she made it to the IAS via promotion. She has played a key role in empowering women in rural Maharashtra. Another change for Nagpur is the departure of additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma, who will take charge as collector of Dhule district. Recently Nagpur got a new divisional commissioner when Prajakta Verma took over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/r-vimala-is-new-nagpur-collector/articleshow/84277776.cms||---

The Karni Vihar police on Wednesday registered an FIR under Sections 429 (Mischief by killing or maiming cattle, etc of any value or any animal of the value of fifty rupees) and 279 (Rash driving or riding on a public way) of the IPC. The complaint states that one Brahma Prakash, ran over the pet dog, a three-year-old pug. The incident took place when the owner was taking the animal outside her home at 6.30 pm. The pet dog, Timtim, died on the spot and a postmortem was also conducted. “The car driver did not show any remorse, in fact, he shrugged it off by saying that it was just a dog,” said the owner of the dog. SHO, Karni Vihar, Jai Singh, told TOI that the investigation into the case is underway. “We have registered an FIR. It is a case of an accident, in which a dog died. We will take statements and proceed further,” he said. The owner said that the dog, named Timtim, did not trouble anyone in the neighborhood. “The pet was part of our family. We had taken her out in the evening when the car driver came to the wrong side and mowed our dog. The family was grief-stricken,” a family member told TOI. The family members of the pet then sought the help of animal rights activists to file a complaint. “The car driver acted very irresponsibly and he drove over the dog not once but twice. And when the animal died, he said it was just a dog, why to bother about it,” said animal rights activist, Laj Rathore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/car-driver-mows-down-pet-dog-in-city-fir-lodged/articleshow/84281986.cms||---

Officials of the reserve said that they have already started working on the project. The proposal was initiated after former chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat made the announcement while on a visit to Corbett in March this year. According to officials, CTR has invited tenders for the project. Speaking to TOI, RK Tiwari, warden of CTR, said, “We are working to zero in on a site for the project and the firms have been asked to send in their proposals. The detailed project report being finalised.” When asked if the episode of Discovery’s Man Vs Wild featuring Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also be part of the show, Tiwari said, “The PM’s visit was obviously a big thing for CTR and even though we have not finalised what would be the content of the show, we will definitely include the visit.” Tiwari added that the show will emerge as a major attraction for tourists. “At present, a tourist generally visits only one range of the reserve and the tiger sightings are also a matter of luck but through the light and sound show, we will be able to inform the tourists of the heritage of CTR and make them aware of the other ranges and the areas where general public is not allowed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/corbett-to-hold-light-and-sound-show-discoverys-man-vs-wild-featuring-modi-also-to-be-a-part-of-the-screening/articleshow/84275548.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra plans ordinance to intervene in school vs parents fee fights, says minister||The long-drawn stalemate between parents and private schools over fees is likely to see a breakthrough as the state government is mulling an ordinance as early as next month empowering officials to deal with such conflicts. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad told TOI that under the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, the state does not have the power to interfere. “A file has been put up to see what changes can be made and we may take the ordinance route for now. It may come up in the next cabinet meet itself,” she said. Questions are being raised about why the BJP-led government, which passed the law in 2018, did not solve the fees issue. Former school education minister Vinod Tawde said it would have been legally untenable. “There was no provision through which private school fees can be dictated by the state,” he said. The state has realised it legally cannot dictate schools to lower or waive fees of students, hence the process of considering changes started. Moreover, a key committee, the Divisional Fee Regulatory Committee (DFRC), was not operational for over a year, during which parents and schools clashed over fees before public representatives, education officials and even the judiciary. Gaikwad did not reveal whether the proposed ordinance aims to empower the government to cap fees or waive it. “I don’t think the government will do that as it will be challenged in court. In Mumbai, children of rich families attend these high-end schools and if their fees are capped, the schools will be severely hit financially. Every school’s fee is a result of its own infrastructure and popularity. Maybe the ordinance will give us power to adjudicate to some extent in fee disputes,” said a senior education official, who did not wish to be identified. According to Constitutional experts, an ordinance is the quickest route for the government. Former state attorney-general and senior advocate Shreehari Aney said: “The cabinet can pass the ordinance but it will have to be approved by the governor. Once approved, it’s valid for six months and can be extended.” Gaikwad said: “If an amendment in the law is to be done, we can look into it during the next sitting of the legislature.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-plans-ordinance-to-intervene-in-school-vs-parents-fee-fights-says-minister/articleshow/84280100.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Though this is his second LLD, he told TOI that he was more content due to the fact that it was bestowed by his alma mater in recognition of his work. “I had an old association with this historic institution, ever since I graduated in 1977-78 from the University College of Law (Now, Dr Ambedkar law College). When you are graduating, you never think that you will reach a stage where the university would bestow you with the honorary degree one day,” he said. As the judge couldn’t attend the event held at the convocation hall owing to health reasons, his son Shriniwas, who flew specially from Delhi on Thursday, was handed over the prestigious degree. Adding that it was a proud moment for him to receive the honor, justice Bobde thanked the NU authorities and former Supreme Court judge Vikas Sirpurkar, who consented to preside over the ceremony. “It’s indeed a great feeling when you remember the extraordinary talent this university has churned out over the years.” Justice Bobde was earlier conferred with ‘LLD Honoris Causa’ by the Chennai based Tamil Nadu Dr Ambedkar Law University on July 13, 2019, when he was a senior most judge of the apex court. It was bestowed on him by President of India Ramnath Kovind in presence of former Madras High Court Chief Justice Vijaya Tahilramani and Tamil Nadu governor Banwarilal Purohit. “When I had received first LLD from TN university in 2019, I often used to get queries on when I would be getting it from NU, which is my own university. After today’s function, I hope those queries would be stopped,” he said. NU however, failed to invite the President or Bombay High Court’s Chief Justice and even governor BS Koshyari, who earlier agreed to personally attend the ceremony, attended it online from Delhi, NU officials told TOI. Earlier, Sirpurkar exhorted the students to excel in their respective fields and wished them all the best for their future endeavours. While congratulating the medal winners, the former SC judge had listed out names of renowned alumni who passed out from NU. Citing examples of former President of India and ex-CJI Mohammed Hidyatullah, ex-Prime Minister PV Narsimha Rao, former chief ministers, Vasantrao Naik, Sudhakarrao Naik and Devendra Fadnavis, union minister Nitin Gadkari, Sirpurkar called on the students to maintain this rich tradition set by these stalwarts In his address, Koshyari asked the students to follow the path of truth and honesty and pay respects to the parents, teachers, and the nation. Vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari, in his introductory speech, explained on the progress made by the university in the last one year where a chair in the name of Bhagwan Chakradhar Swami was started along with the Constitution Park. The ceremony started with a traditional procession led by the VC, pro-VC Sanjay Dudhe, registrar Raju Hiwase, Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable, deans – Rajesh Shingru, Sanjay Kavishwar Nirmal Singh, Rajashree Vaishnav, and Management Council members. Owing to the strict Covid-19 protocol, none of the degree holders and medal winners were invited and even the media was barred, due to limitations of 50 persons. All of them would be physically handed over their medals, prizes, and degrees from July 12 onwards, according to the pro-VC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/honoured-to-get-highest-degree-from-alma-mater-ex-cji-bobde/articleshow/84277891.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

According to a decision taken on Friday, students of classes IX to XII can go to campuses from July 16 provided their parents give an undertaking. Those studying in classes VI to VIII can come to school from July 23. No decision has been taken for students of classes I to V. An official of the secondary and elementary education department clarified it would not be mandatory for the students to visit school as online classes would continue. But schools allowing physical sessions would have to ensure strict social distancing and other such Covid protocols. The department’s director will on July 12 conduct a video conference with teachers to clear all kinds of doubts. Schools in Gurugram backed the government’s decision. Col Pratap Singh (retd), the district president of the Haryana Progressive Schools’ Conference, said, “We welcome the decision. The Covid situation appears to be stabilising and people have started going out. So, keeping schools closed would not be appropriate. We are all geared up to welcome kids back But we will observe the reaction of parents for 4-5 days and then make a decision.” Several schools in the city have decided to ask parents to give a travel declaration. Students who have gone out on vacation or to attend any event would not be allowed to attend physical classes for 10 to 14 days, officials said. “We’ll be sending out Google Forms to take the consent of parents. We’ll operate in the same manner as we did in the previous session,” said Rashmi Mallik, the principal of Salwan Public School. Many, however, said ensuring Covid-appropriate behaviour on the campus would be key to continuing with the offline classes. “The onus is on all of us to ensure safety. Social distancing, proper sanitisation of the premises, and screening to detect early symptoms are just some of the things that the schools need to be mindful of,” said Aditi Mishra, the principal of Delhi Public School in Sector 45.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/haryana-allows-schools-to-open-from-july-16-in-phases/articleshow/84280035.cms||---

Umranangal, who is an accused in the firing cases dating to October 2015, appeared in the Faridkot court on Friday. He gave written permission to his narco analysis, as per the Supreme Court guidelines. The court of ilaqa magistrate Ajay Pal Singh directed the SIT to make arrangements for conducting the test on Umranangal. On coming out of the court, Umranagal said, “I am ready to go for narco test five times, but such test should also be conducted on Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, so the truth may come out as he investigated the case in a purely biased manner and implicated me even in the Behbal Kalan case with ill intentions, whereas I had not gone to Behbal Kalan on that day (October 14, 2015, when two protesters were killed allegedly in police firing).” Umranagal said he was ready for the test, which should be conducted as per Supreme Court guidelines. His counsel said the test should be conducted outside Punjab and Chandigarh after complete medical examination. Umranangal denied that he had gone to Kotkapura on his own. He said that then DGP (Sumedh Singh Saini) had made it clear that he had called the IG. “As I had a stint of eight years as SP of Faridkot, Ferozepur DIG, Bathinda IG range and I had cordial relations with locals and leaders. I was called by the DG for mediation in Kotkapura and to defuse the situation. I was successful in that. Suddenly, a clash ensued on the morning of October 14. If any firing, water canon or tear gas shells were used on protesters, it happened with the orders of duty magistrate, not with my orders”. Earlier, ex-DGP Saini and ex-SSP Charanjit Singh Sharma had refused to undergo narco analysis, citing ill health and old age. Umranangal had given his assent on July 6. The present SIT which is probing the Kotkapura case, and is headed by ADGP L K Yadav, had on June 11 moved an application in Faridkot court for permission to conduct narco analysis, polygraph and brain electrical activation profile (BEAP) of Saini, Umranagal and Sharma. The SIT prayed that they were not cooperating in the examination and tests needed to be done on them to know the truth. The three are facing both Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan cases. After a bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court on April 9 quashed the investigations in Kotkapura case and made adverse comments on the investigations made by Kunwar Vijay, he had taken voluntary retirement and later joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). The court of Faridkot additional district and session judge Harbans Singh Lekhi on Friday adjourned the Behbal Kalan case for August 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/suspended-ig-do-narco-analysis-of-ex-ig-vijay-too/articleshow/84283700.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Delhi||HC rejects illegal detention plea by student activist||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed a plea on behalf of student activist Gulfisha Fatima, in jail after her arrest under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) case relating to a larger conspiracy in the northeast Delhi riots last year. A habeas corpus plea had been filed by Fatima’s kin claiming that her detention was illegal and sought her production. But the court said, the plea was “completely misplaced,” “not maintainable” and dismissed it. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said the writ of habeas corpus would not lie in respect of a person who was in judicial custody. “The facts show that the petitioner is in judicial custody and detention, which cannot be termed as illegal,” the bench said. It further said, if Fatima was aggrieved by the court orders passed in judicial proceedings before the trial court, she had the legal remedy to challenge them in proper proceedings. During the hearing, the bench asked the counsel if he was willing to withdraw the plea as it was of the view that writ of habeas corpus was not maintainable in this case. The counsel submitted that his instructions were not to withdraw. Advocate Amit Mahajan, representing Delhi Police, said the habeas corpus petition filed by Fatima was not maintainable and nothing but a blatant abuse of the process of law and deserved to be dismissed with a cost. He also told the court that a habeas corpus petition by Fatima’s brother on the same relief was dismissed by the high court last year. On July 5, another bench of the high court had refused to hear the matter after taking a strong exception to Fatima’s advocate, Mehmood Pracha, taking recourse to “heckling” and placing reliance on facts that were not on record. The previous bench had recused and directed that the petition be placed before another bench. Fatima was arrested on April 11 last year and is currently under judicial custody. She is also accused in three other riots-related cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-rejects-illegal-detention-plea-by-student-activist/articleshow/84280060.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||AAP, BJP slam each other over desilting||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Friday alleged that the BJP-run municipal corporations had looted crores in the name of desilting of colony drains while not even 5% of these drains had been cleaned. North Delhi Municipal Corporation, he alleged, claims to have extracted 9,883MT silt and the south corporation 35,000MT, but no silt has been removed.The MLA warned that all colonies would be flooded during the monsoon. As the drains are full of silt, rainwater will overflow and come on main roads, he claimed. He challenged the south corporation commissioner to show him the colonies from where the silt had been removed.The corporation has paid Rs 30-40 crore to remove 35,705MT silt, Bharadwaj cliamed. “Why was this payment made if no work was actually done? A loot of crores has been made by politicians and officials. The payment was done to the contractors and later the same payment will be distributed,” he alleged. Bharadwaj said that in the past two and a half months, the public works department (PWD) had cleaned manholes on main roads. The work is still on, he added.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said Bharadwaj was habituated to make baseless allegations against the corporations to drive political mileage by maligning them. “He raised the issue against the corporations to cover up the failure of Delhi Jal Board, PWD and the flood department, which come under Delhi government, to desilt major drains,” Kapoor claimed. “Anyone can see that Barapullah, Najafgarh and Shahdara drains are overflowing. Delhi government departments were supposed to clean them up,” he said. The corporations have completed their work; but because connecting major drains have not been cleaned, small colony drains are unable to exit into them, he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-bjp-slam-each-other-over-desilting/articleshow/84277874.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The incident is of Bilpur village in Dholpur where the girl was married off a week ago. According to the letter, the district childline had informed the administration about the nuptials on June 21, but no preventive action was taken due to which the girl was married off on June 30. The child panel has asked the district collector to identify the person/persons who supported or encouraged the child marriage and take strict action against them. A report of the incident and subsequent actions has to be submitted to the commission within a week’s time. In April, the state home department had issued guidelines according to which the district administration needs to be vigilant in order to prevent child marriages and the wedding invites should also have the birth dates of the groom as well as the bride so that it can be established that they are not minors. Control rooms have also been set up where information regarding child marriages can be given. The commission had been successful in stopping a total of 48 child marriages in 33 districts between April and December 2020 at the time when the lockdown was strictly in place. Out of this, a total of 18 child marriages were prevented in Bhilwara which was the highest in Rajasthan followed by Sikar, Karauli, Tonk and others which had half a dozen cases each. Out of the child marriages prevented during this period, in only eight of them did the officials had to take the legal course of action whereas in the remaining incidents, they were stopped through dialogue. The information regarding child marriages can be given on the helpline number 1098 or on WhatsApp number 7733870243. The identity of the persons calling on these numbers will be kept confidential so that people are encouraged to come forward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/panel-writes-to-dholpur-dm-over-child-marriage/articleshow/84282048.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

---||Mumbai||Bhagwat Karad’s induction BJP ploy to finish Pankaja’s career: Shiv Sena||MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Friday alleged that BJP’s move in the union cabinet expansion of choosing first-time Rajya Sabha MP Bhagwat Karad as minister of state instead of Pritam Munde was a ploy to finish the political career of her elder sister, BJP’s Pankaja Munde. Pankaja, however, clarified that she did not believe the BJP was trying to finish off her career and said that the sisters were not upset over the party’s decision of ot inducting Pritam Munde. On Wednesday, four BJP MPs from Maharashtra were inducted into the union cabinet: Narayan Rane, Kapil Patil, Bharati Pawar and Karad. While Rane is in the Union cabinet, the other three are ministers of state. The Sena mouthpiece Saamna in its editorial on Friday stated that Karad had grown up in the shadow of the late Gopinath Munde, father of Pankaja and Pritam, but instead of considering Pritam, Karad had been made a union minister. “It is a ploy to completely finish off the political career of Pankaja Munde. There is scope to suspect that it has been done to divide the (Vanjara community) and to teach Pankaja a lesson,” the paper stated. Karad (64) is a paediatric surgeon and an OBC face from central Maharashtra and is seen as being close to former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. He was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in March 2020. Sena also stated that the induction of Kapil Patil and Bharati Pawar was like a “shock treatment” for BJP loyalists as both had recently joined BJP after leaving NCP. “It is like rubbing salt on the wounds of BJP loyalists,” Saamna claimed. It also targeted the BJP over creation of a cooperation portfolio at the Centre, stating, “Cooperation is a state subject, so it is being alleged that the Centre was trying to encroach upon the rights of states. This should not happen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/karads-induction-bjp-ploy-to-finish-pankajas-career-in-mumbai-sena/articleshow/84282108.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Durga Puja forum proposes vaccine for organizers, scaled-down celebration||KOLKATA: The Forum for Durgotsab has requested puja organisers to scale down celebrations in view of the pandemic and has drawn up a list of safety measures that they wish the state government and the puja committees to implement during Durga Puja this year as a precaution against Covid-19. The list of safety measures includes full vaccination of the organizers, arranging vaccination of workers setting up pandals, installing lights and doing other chores, scaling down celebrations to avoid big crowds and planning pandals with proper ventilation. Forum for Durgotsab, the umbrella body of Durga Puja organisers in the city and districts, will share the list of measures with the government soon. “Safeguard against Covid-19 is our priority and it will not be compromised. We have drawn up a list of safety measures like last year that we feel will allow us to organise Durga Puja by following all Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. We wish to share this with the chief minister and hope the government will suggest more points and recommend this to all organisers,” said Saswata Basu, secretary of the Forum. A member of the Forum said scaling down celebrations will not attract huge crowds, which will help in maintaining Covid-appropriate behaviour. “We have seen in the past some pujas attract lakhs of people on a daily basis. If something like that happens now, it will be difficult to maintain social distancing. We must not forget that pandemic is not over yet and a third wave might be a reality,” said an organiser who is also a member of the Forum. The pandemic has changed the way festivals are traditionally organised. Last year, too, Durga Puja celebrations were scaled down owing to the pandemic. According to points drawn up by the Forum, all the members of puja committees must be fully vaccinated. “We can also offer to arrange for the vaccination of decorators, people installing lights and involved in other chores with the help of the state government. The ventilation inside the pandal is the most important thing,” said Basu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/durga-puja-forum-proposes-vax-for-organizers-scaled-down-celebration/articleshow/84277922.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Ludhiana||Punjab: Talwandi Sabo Power Limited plant shut as snag hits last working unit too||PATIALA: All three units of Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL) thermal plant were shut on Friday as the last operational unit of the electricity generation unit also tripped due to a technical snag. The unit was already running on half-load capacity for two days. A unit of TSPL has been shut since March this year, whereas the second unit was shut on Sunday due to technical problems. With all three units of the 1,980 MW plant now unoperational, the state’s power crisis worsened. A 210 MW unit of Ropar thermal plant has also been unoperational since Wednesday night after a boiler leakage. The state has a power shortage and, thus, PSPCL has been forced to impose power regulatory measures on south and border zones to make up for the shortage. On Thursday, PSPCL imposed power cuts of more than six hours in some parts of Punjab. In Kandi area, a five-hour-long power cut was imposed, whereas in some urban areas around three-hour-long cuts were imposed. Rural areas faced a four-hour power cut. Officials at TSPL in Mansa said the unit which tripped on Friday will be operational again after 48 hours, while the unit that got shut on Sunday will be operational after one week. Earlier, the plant had promised to get the unit functional soon. A spokesperson of TSPL said the unit which has been shut since March is expected to be operational by the end of this month. “Components for the unit shut since March have arrived from China. Company has spent manifolds to ensure timely delivery of the same. Normally, it would take about 10 months for restoration, but with PSPCL’s support, TSPL is ensuring its operation within 4 months. With imposition of restrictions on imported coal, TSPL is largely dependent on domestic coal with high ash content, resulting in frequent breakdown of units. Unit no 1 which broke down on Sunday last has some turbine issues and a team of Korean engineers along with BHEL experts (engineers sent by PSPCL), GE engineers and TSPL engineers are working day in and out to identify and rectify the problem. The unit is likely to be restored shortly. The second unit which stopped today has minor technical snag and shall be restored within 48 hours,” said the spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/tspl-plant-shut-as-snag-hits-last-working-unit-too/articleshow/84283707.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||Kolkata||44 hours of sporting action to keep Kolkata glued to screen||KOLKATA: For sports fans, this weekend promises to be one like no other. Four blockbuster matches in three mega events will whet the appetite of both football and tennis fans as the tournaments played in two continents reach the climax over Saturday and Sunday. Saturday will set the mood with a relaxed third-fourth place Copa America playoff between Columbia and Peru. It will be followed by the Wimbledon women’s final in which Karolina Plíšková from Czechia will take on the mighty Australian Ashleigh Barty. Sunday will be action packed with the high-decibel Brazil-Argentina clash in the Copa America final early in the morning. In the evening, it will be the men’s final at Wimbledon, followed by the grand finale of the Euro Cup in which Italy will take on England. Football and tennis fans are stocking up on beer and starters for two days of pure madness. With so many big matches packed into 44 hours, power naps will be crucial to stay on the ball and beat fatigue. “I will try to catch a wink on Saturday afternoon, sleep early on Saturday evening and again take a power nap on Sunday afternoon to be absolutely awake when the matches are telecast live,” said Sudip Naha, a rowing coach and a die-hard England fan. According to Gautam Arora, a fan of Italy since the days of Roberto Baggio, England was plain lucky to be in the final. “Raheem Sterling took a dive and an English fan behaved disgracefully by pointing a laser light at the eye of Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. Italy will be an altogether different proposition,” said Arora. For Argentine fan Ayan Mitra and Brazil die-hard Sambit Banerjee, the adrenaline is already pumping so high that they can't wait for Sunday to arrive. “I don't think we will sleep that night. Argentina has a definite edge as Lionel Messi is in vintage form,” said Mitra. Banerjee, though, believes it will be Brazil and Neymar who will lift the trophy. The fact that the matches are lined up over the weekend has come as a relief for techie Souvick Mitra and his brother Snehasis, music teacher at a city school, both of whom had late log-ins on multiple occasions over the last two weeks because of the overnight and early morning schedule of Euro and Copa America games. “Thankfully, we don’t have to worry about getting late for office this time and enjoy the game through the nights,” said Souvick, who is rooting for Italy and Brazil, while Snehasis favours England and Argentina. Jaffer Javed, the grandson of former Indian Davis Cup player and captain Akhtar Ali, expects Ashleigh Barty and Novak Djokovic to lift the women’s and men’s title at Wimbledon. “Pliskova is in fine form but I think Barty’s power play will prevail. As for the men’s game, I don't see any threat to Djokovic lifting the 20th Grand Slam title,” he said. As an ideal topping over the action-packed sports weekend of tennis and football, cricket will follow suit as India women will face England in the second T20 game on Sunday and from Tuesday, a young Indian side will take on Sri Lanka in ODIs and T20Is. “The flurry of sporting events over the weekend has been a welcome relief from the severely depressing state of Covid, unemployment and price rise that our country is dealing with now,” said psychologist Siladitya Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/44-hours-of-sporting-action-to-keep-city-glued-to-screen/articleshow/84277934.cms||Subhro Niyogi

While six bodies were retrieved by rescue teams, three others swept away by swirling currents are missing. Fifteen pilgrims of the same family from Agra had come to Ayodhya to offer prayers at Ramjanmabhoomi and take a holy dip in the Saryu. Eyewitnesses said, when some pilgrims tried to wade into the waters to take a dip, they slipped and fell. With no barricading chains along the Saryu to aid bathers, other family members who jumped into the river to save their kin were trapped in the strong current. Hearing their screams, residents swung into action and managed to rescue six of the family members. Soon, PAC jawans joined the rescue mission after the Ayodhya administration launched a massive search operation for the missing. “If trained life guards are deployed at the ghats, lives could have been saved,” said a local resident.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed senior officers to reach the spot and supervise rescue operation. He also directed divers, police and provincial armed constabulary (PAC) to conduct swift rescue operations. Chief medical superintendent, Ayodhya district hospital, Dr C N B Tripathi said, six bodies have reached the hospital and among them are two men, three women and a girl. District magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha said, “Fifteen members of a family from Agra district were taking bath at Guptaar Ghat when they slipped into the Saryu and were swept away by the strong current. Six people have died, six been rescued, but three are still untraceable. Search operation is on.” The deceased included Lalit (40), Pankaj (25), Shruti (20), Rajkumari (60), Sita (35) and Drishti (4). Those missing include Priyanshi (16), Julee (35) and Sarthak (10). They are all residents of Shastri Puram area of Agra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/9-of-agra-family-drown-in-ayodhyas-saryu-river/articleshow/84282083.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Irregularities unearthed in land allotments in Jaisalmer||JAISALMER: The colonisation department has uncovered major irregularities in land allotments in the Nachana area of the Jaisalmer district. The vigilance wing of the department found that some officials illegally issued excess lands to people who were not entitled beneficiaries. According to the additional commissioner, colonisation vigilance, Mahavir Singh, in January 2006, the allotment committee had issued an order to allot land to about 54 beneficiaries. Subsequently, several officials working in connivance, made over 200 additional unauthorised allotments. These excess allotments were completely illegal and made while flouting the norms. The vigilance unit also found that several of the tehsildars, patwaris, and other senior officials facilitated these unauthorised allotments. Similarly, in April 2006, the committee selected 40 other allotments. But the officials again found a way and issued as many as 92 other dubious allotments without any legal basis. Interestingly, Singh also found in his investigation that land mutations and other requisite work were done using photocopies without any original documents. “Ever since we began our probe, new irregularities have been continuously unraveling. In our investigation of allotment in Nachna 1, we examined around 20 percent of the record and found nearly Rs 4 lakh were embezzled. Similarly, during our examination of 30 percent of records pertaining to the allotment in Nachana 2, we found embezzlement to the tune of Rs 1 crore,” Singh said. In the last decade, the department suspects that some officers and employees flouted rules to benefit themselves from allotments. Sources suspect that officials from tehsildars, patwaris to even RAS were involved. The Rajasthan Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has also launched an investigation into the bogus allotments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/irregularities-unearthed-in-land-allotments-in-jaisalmer/articleshow/84282116.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Cleaning only beaches won’t clean the coastline, says Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Cleaning the coastline is not only about beach cleaning, said the Bombay high court on Friday, adding that it includes all measures to ensure that waste is not dumped into the sea. “It is a larger issue,’’ a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni said after a cursory glance at a note submitted by advocate-general general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, with advocate Akshay Shinde, on “Mumbai beach garbage waste”. Hearing a PIL and referring to the aftermath of cyclone Tauktae when tonnes of garbage had been dumped by the sea on several city beaches, the HC wanted to know how the state, Centre and BMC plans to deal with the problem. The judges said keeping the coastlines clean involved all measures to deal with the issue of dumping garbage into the sea. “From where do all the material get into the sea? How can it be prevented? It goes deeper,” said Justice Kulkarni. The judges said in all coastal areas, there are issues of slums and encroachments, from where usually untreated garbage goes straight into rivers or seas. They cited the example of the super polluted Mithi river. “Everything is dumped. What comes out is only a fraction. What must be in the belly of the ocean, we don’t know,” said Justice Kulkarni, adding that “every year this is happening”. The government’s note said Mumbai has seven beaches, out of which six are cleaned manually and BMC has recently purchased cleaning machines with the latest technology. The waste is segregated and sent to dumping grounds. In 2020-21, a total of 62,793 metric tonnes was collected, out of which 8,409 MT was sent for recycling. It also said BMC has installed eight primary sewage treatment plants, where the sewage is treated before being discharged into the sea. “At these plants, by way of filtration and other processes, plastic and other solid waste is segregated and is thus prevented from polluting the sea,’’ it added. With the National Green Tribunal permitting discharge of sewage into the sea only after treatment, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board has issued appropriate directions to the BMC to instal mechanical gates and screens to stop garbage from going into the sea. Also, bye laws provide for penal action against slum-dwellers residing near river, nalla and creek dumping waste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cleaning-only-beaches-wont-clean-the-coastline-says-hc/articleshow/84283727.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The girl’s apparently fled from home as she was regularly beaten up by her father and the child panel has no information that he even filed a missing person report. The girl joined a group of ragpickers and was spotted at Vidisha railway station by a school teacher following which she was taken to the shelter. Mahendra Pratap Singh, deputy secretary, Rajasthan commission for protection of child rights said, “The child does not have a mother and her father used to beat her because of which she ran away and got onto a train. Along the way she started working with the ragpickers and somehow reached Vidisha and on June 19 the local child welfare committee (CWC) came to know of her. Since then she has been staying at the shelter. I have written to the Vidisha CWC to send the girl home accompanied by a lady official and the process for the same has been initiated.” According to officials, while the girl tells that she hailed from Jaisalmer but could not give her exact address though she has expressed a desire to go back to her maternal grandparents and not to her father. The child is expected to reach Jaisalmer in few days’ time and she has already undergone a medical examination though at present the officials do not have any information if there was any sexual abuse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/girl-who-fled-home-due-to-dads-beating-found-in-mp/articleshow/84282103.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

This is the third time in July that the BMC has had to cancel the drive. Private centres ran and administered over 40,000 doses on Friday, according to CoWin. Civic officials said vaccination will resume on Monday. Responding to remarks by newly appointed Union junior minister Dr Bharti Pravin Pawar, minister and state NCP chief Nawab Malik said: “MoS health Bharati Pravin said there should be no vaccine politics. The Centre puts out huge statistics, but vaccines do not reach the state. Many centres in Mumbai are shut.” He urged the state to chart a plan. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said they are hoping to receive 95,000 doses on Saturday. “We don’t know when the doses will arrive, so we have decided to suspend the drive,” she said. Till now, over 34 lakh people have got at least one dose and 12.5 lakh are fully vaccinated in Mumbai. The vaccination numbers dropped drastically in Maharashtra too on Friday. According to CoWin, the state could administer less than 2 lakh doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-vax-arrive-bmc-drive-cancelled-for-2nd-day-today/articleshow/84280139.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Challan in Bargari case submitted||BATHINDA: Taking ahead its probe into cases of sacrilege, the special investigation team (SIT) headed by Punjab Police IG (border range) Surinderpal Singh Parmar, on Friday filed the challan in the case pertaining to torn pages of Bir of Guru Granth Sahib at Bargari on October 12, 2015. The challan has been filed against Sukhjinder Singh alias Sunny, Shakti Singh, Ranjit Singh alias Bhola, Baljit Singh, Nishan Singh and Pardeep Singh under sections 295, 295-A, 153-A, 201, and 120-B of Indian Penal Code in the court of Faridkot judicial magistrate (first class) Tarjani. The court fixed the case for hearing on July 20. This is the first case in any of the three sacrilege cases being investigated by new SIT. The case was registered at Bajakhana police station on a complaint by Kulwinder Singh, manager of the gurdwara at Bargari. The new SIT arrested the six accused on May 16. Parmar said the investigation was in advanced stages in all three cases. As the first challan has been filed in one of the cases, more challans will be filed soon in other cases, he added. A lot of hue and cry is being made over delay in solving the sacrilege and firing cases. Sources said going by it, the Congress high command has asked the state government to speed up the investigation and government now wanted the cases to be taken to their logical conclusion at the earliest before the upcoming assembly elections slated for early 2022. The cases of sacrilege and theft of Bir of Guru Granth Sahib from gurdwara of Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village on June 1, 2015; pasting derogatory posters at Bargari on September 25, 2015; and sacrilege at Bargari on October 12; were transferred to CBI for investigation on November 2, 2015. The state government on September 6, 2018, had notified to take back the sacrilege cases from CBI. The CBI had submitted the joint closure report in special CBI court at Mohali in all three cases on July 4, 2019. The high court had then transferred the investigation of this case to Punjab Police. In concurrence with the high court orders a new SIT was constituted under Parmar with Rajinder Singh Sohal, AIG/CI, as the other member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/challan-in-bargari-case-submitted/articleshow/84283717.cms||Neel Kamal

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 63-yr-old to return home after 61 days on life support||KOLKATA: A 63-year-old Covid patient from Ranchi, who was airlifted to Kolkata in May in a critical sate, is now ready to return home from a city private hospital after an intense treatment, including 19 days of ECMO support and 42 days on ventilation. Doctors said that Ganesh Prasad, the patient, could be one rare case who defeated the virus after such a long battle on critical care support. Prasad had tested positive on April 30 and was admitted to a nursing home in Ranchi. But his condition kept deteriorating due to the intensity of the infection. He was put on BiPAP support when he did not show any signs of recovery on non-invasive ventilation (NIV). As the condition continued to deteriorate, he was intubated and put on full ventilation. Even when full ventilation failed to revive him, Prasad’s son Rahul Kumar contacted the ECMO team at AMRI Hospital-Dhakuria and decided to bring him to Kolkata. The family immediately arranged for an air ambulance to fly him to Kolkata on May 20, while on ventilation. On board the flight to Kolkata, his condition worsened further and his oxygen level dipped to 50%. The AMRI medical team, led by ECMO specialist Soham Majumdar and Prasad’s supervising physician, transported him from Kolkata airport on full ventilator support and put him on ECMO support immediately on admission to the Dhakuria hospital. He remained on ECMO support for 19 days, till June 9, after which he was again shifted to ventilator support. “Since he was first detected with Covid-19, he has been in hospital for 64 days till July 9, of which 19 days have been on ECMO and 42 days on ventilator,” Majumdar said. The critical care consultant believes Ganesh Prasad is the only Covid patient across India to have survived such a long period on critical care support, including both ECMO and full ventilation. The patient’s recovery has, however, not been free of twists and turns. He suffered a few episodes of convulsions while on ventilator, but Majumdar and Kaushik Mukherjee, cardio thoracic vascular surgery head, were able to manage the challenges successfully. The patient also underwent a tracheostomy to manage him on prolonged ventilation. Doctors gradually weaned him off ventilation on June 29. Since then, his oxygen requirement has decreased significantly and right now, he is on intermittent oxygen support. “The whole situation was new for us and it has been a very difficult period,” his son said. “Now that he is doing much better and can even talk to us, we are relieved and happy that we will be taking him back home in a day or two,” said daughter-in-law Anamika.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/63-yr-old-to-return-home-after-61-days-on-life-support/articleshow/84277965.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Pune||Met department hints at monsoon revival in Maharashtra from today||PUNE: Monsoon revival is in sight for Maharashtra, with the rainfall activity set to increase from Saturday. India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said there were chances of heavy to very heavy rain, and even extremely heavy rainfall in isolated parts of the state for few days after July 10. The city has a heavy rain (at isolated places) warning from Monday (July 12), while ghat areas in the district have been put on a very heavy to extremely heavy rain alert from July 13. Anupam Kashyapi, the head of weather forecasting division, IMD, Pune, told TOI, “Rain may be widespread for several days (up to a week) after July 10 because of the formation of several weather systems — a strong upper air cyclonic circulation over the northwest Bay of Bengal, adjoining coastal areas of Odisha and West Bengal, an upcoming low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal and the strengthening of westerly winds, among other reasons, including likely formation of offshore trough.” An IMD forecast on Friday said further strengthening of south-westerly winds from the Arabian Sea and the likely formation of a low-pressure area over the west-central and adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal around July 11 were likely to cause enhanced rainfall activity with fairly widespread to widespread rainfall along the west coast and adjoining peninsular India during the next five days. Isolated heavy to very heavy falls with isolated extremely heavy rain are very likely over Maharashtra and Goa, among other regions of peninsular India, during the July 9-13 period. Isolated extremely heavy falls are also likely over ghat areas of Madhya Maharashtra on July 12-13, and Konkan and Goa during July 11-13. Kashyapi said monsoon revival was likely not only in Maharashtra but also in the country. “Revival of monsoon over northwest and central India is expected from July 10. Among other reasons, a shear zone has developed over the central parts of the country at 20° North and is likely to persist for a few days. Konkan-Goa and Vidarbha region are likely to get widespread rain (more than 75% areas) during the next five to seven days. Heavy to very heavy rain at isolated locations are also likely here. Madhya Maharashtra and Marathwada have chances of widespread rain from around July 10, with very heavy rainfall to extremely heavy rain at isolated places warnings for ghat areas,” he said. The monsoon revival news comes against the backdrop of less kharif sowing in Maharashtra this monsoon so far compared to the last year because of lull in rainfall activities. Last year, the total sowing till July 6 was around 71%, which this time is approximately 61% (till July 5). A recent report from the agriculture department stated that the crops sown were in germination to growth stage and if there was no rain for the next 8-10 days, emergency planning would be required. Vikas Patil, the director of agriculture (extension and training), agriculture Commissionerate, told TOI, “Though rainfall has restarted in some parts of state, the agriculture belt in Nashik, Dhule, Nandurbar and Jalgaon districts is reeling from dry conditions. Monsoon deficits here currently range from 22-52%, which is a concern. Sangli, Satara and Solapur have also recorded less rainfall so far. Once the rain begins, farmers can restart sowing in Maharashtra. Sowing should be complete in the state with the upcoming rain spells.” Dr Kripan Ghosh, head, agriculture meteorology division, IMD, Pune, said, “Revival of monsoon and likely spells of rain will be helpful for sowing of kharif crops in unsown areas of Maharashtra. Farmers are advised to undertake sowing at optimum soil moisture ( vapsa) condition. The farmers, who have already sown their crops earlier and are experiencing moisture deficiency, will also benefit from these rain spells.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/met-dept-hints-at-monsoon-revival-in-state-from-today/articleshow/84280157.cms||Neha Madaan

She said that if Punjab government does not send the stock by morning, there will be no vaccination on Saturday. “We are left with just one day Covaxin dosages but we have already run out of Covishield. We are looking at the state for the next consignment to carry on with the vaccination drive on Saturday,” she said. Increase in supplies was critical, given the gradual opening of sectors conditional to stakeholders having taken at least one dose, said the civil surgeon. She said that Mohali has the highest number of frontline workers vaccinated in the state and the 18 to 44 years is also being rapidly covered. Pointing out that Mohali had already vaccinated nearly 78% of eligible persons with the first dose and 18% with the second dose, the civil surgeon said that the stock was being utilised in the district without any wastage. She said Mohali was able to utilise more than 22,000 doses in a single day when adequate supply was received. While the first dose has been administered to 6.5 lakh people, 1.3 lakh people received the second dose, she informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-runs-out-of-covishield-covaxin-stock-for-just-one-day/articleshow/84277745.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai Police trace phone used for ominous Instagram post, find teen||MUMBAI: Within two days of a teen disappearing from home here and posting an ominous down-and-out note on social media, Mumbai police’s crime branch tracked him down 60 km away and brought him back safely. It turned out the 17-year-old had borrowed Rs 45 lakh to start a business, but the venture failed and he lost it all. As creditors started hounding him, he slipped away and was contemplating a drastic step when the cops found him. The teen, who lives with his mother at her maternal home in Andheri (East) since his parents’ divorce, had dropped out of school. For the past year and a half, he had been trying to run a business selling Covid-related gear such as masks, sanitisers and PPE kits. On July 5, he did not return home which got his mother and grandparents worried. They called up all his friends before approaching the Sakinaka police the next day to lodge a missing complaint. The crime branch began a parallel probe as the case involved the disappearance of a minor. Meanwhile, a note surfaced on his Instagram account where the boy wrote that “he had been scammed”. He further wrote that he had made a big mistake and that his dead body would be found soon. The note ended with an apology. One of his friends alerted his mother about the note. The moment she told the crime branch about it, investigators gathered that the matter was serious. “The boy had switched off his phone. But he was accessing social media from someone else’s handset. He was not using this other handset to make or answer any calls, which made our job tough,” said an officer. The police roped in experts to find the location of this second phone. The handset belonged to one of his friends, who wasn’t aware the boy was using it. The location was Virar East, 60 km from the boy’s home. On July 7, a team headed by senior inspector Mahesh Thakur and assistant inspector Dhanraj Chaudhary took a train to Virar. After hunting for some time, they found the teen outside a Ganpati temple, looking crestfallen. After assuring him that things would be okay, investigators asked why he had left home. The boy replied that he had promised to repay his creditors with interest, once he made profits in his business. But he was never able to make any profit. The teen said he had grown up without a father and had frequent arguments with his mother. He said they lived in a small house and were forced to move homes often for lack of funds. He added that his grandparents loved him dearly and he was keen to make it big for their sake, but had ended up disappointing them. The police brought him back and counselled him before reuniting him with his mother. Clinical psychologist Narendra Kinger said when families break up, they should seek out professional counselling. “There should be no shame in taking help from a counsellor. In fact, by speaking to counsellors, parents can know what is actually going on in the child’s mind,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-police-trace-phone-used-for-ominous-insta-post-find-teen/articleshow/84280194.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Nagpur||Third wave: 50,000 beds, 2,000 ventilators ready in Vidarbha||The second wave showed us the worst of Covid pandemic when patients struggled to get oxygen, beds, medicines, and some even died in ambulances and at home. The situation is now well under control, but experts and authorities are foreseeing a third wave. Taking forward the discussion initiated in the TOI Debate held this week, a new series starting today looks at the various aspects of preparedness for the third wave, if it strikes, in Vidarbha NAGPUR: In more than a year’s time battling the crisis, Vidarbha region has build on its Covid management capabilities by putting in place 822 dedicated Covid hospitals (DCHs), dedicated Covid health centres (DCHCs) and Covid Care Centres (CCCs) across the 11 districts. These facilities can collectively cater to over 50,000 patients requiring tertiary care to institutional quarantine at a time. Last year, not more than 6,000 beds were available in the region. The augmented health infrastructure now has over 6,018 ICU and 2,000 ventilator beds, which are crucial in Covid treatment. Before the first wave and to a certain extent till onset of the second one, bed crisis remained basic challenge hounding patients and relatives. Though Covid patients from the region had faced bed shortage in August-September last year during the first wave, the crisis was acute in the second wave. Set up mainly during the second wave onslaught in March-April this year, most of these facilities barely have patients now. At government facilities, the flow has drastically declined. As on date, Vidarbha has less than 1,400 patients under treatment. Since only 20% need hospitalization as per official estimation, the surplus Covid infrastructure in private set up has been shut, while public hospitals are now keeping aside a certain portion for paediatric patients. The third wave, if it strikes, is expected to involve kids, experts have warned. Vidarbha Hospital Association president Dr Ashok Arbat said, “Second wave was unimaginable. The surge of patients, that too within a short period in April-May, was beyond imagination. Practically, we were not prepared to deal with such huge load. Initially, we didn’t have beds, then shortage of oxygen, health workers and required medication. These were hospital-related crises. Next challenge was disposal of Covid bodies or even transfer of patients. All required infrastructure was insufficient.” The health care shortages were blamed on the apathy of government, which didn’t prepare itself enough. “Whatever arrangements were available at private facilities were falling short,” said Dr Arbat. The second wave also led to lot of new hospitals coming up. “Existing hospitals also augmented their capacity by 20 to 30 beds at least, either in basement or shutting down a department, to make way for Covid section. Another set up was starting hospitals in halls or defunct buildings, which has since been shut. Full-time hospitals continue to exist, not just for Covid but also for all patients,” said Dr Arbat. The VHA president felt the existing infrastructure is sufficient as the third wave is not going to be as severe. “A big chunk of population has already been infected, and another lot has been vaccinated. Thus, the third wave, if it comes, is unlikely to be as big as the second,” he said. The second wave also left a trail of another big challenge in black fungus, also known as mucormycosis. Head and neck surgeon Dr Shailesh Kothalkar, who operated numerous mucormycosis patients, said proper monitoring and control of sugar in post-Covid patient is essential. “Diagnostic nasal endoscopy is a basic tool in clinical detection of mucormycosis and must be preferred. Availability of medicines must be ensured,” he said. On black fungus being hospital-acquired infection, Dr Kothalkar said, “It may have some relevance because majority of mucor patients were not treated in properly maintained hygienic conditions. Disinfecting and maintaining hygiene are not possible in small set up though it can’t be proved these were the main reasons. Major cause was immune-suppression caused by the Delta variant. Injudicious use of steroids and lack of sugar control were the other causes,” he said. Dr Kothalkar added, “It should be a must to have a glucometer to ensure post-Covid patients keep checking their sugar level and making them aware about black fungus signs so that they can take preventive measures. Early diagnosis and early treatment is the key,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/third-wave-50k-beds-2k-ventilators-ready-in-vid/articleshow/84278023.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The woman from Vadgaonsheri had uploaded her profile on job portals and was looking for better prospects. Police said the suspects on the pretext of offering her a job with handsome salary wooed her to pay varying charges but she failed to get the job. After the woman asked them to repay her the money, they again lured her into paying various charges and duped her to the tune of over Rs 9.25 lakh.

---||Dehradun||Online classes best option during pandemic but leading to ailments and increased workload, say health experts & teachers||Dehradun: Even though teachers and students in Dehradun acknowledge that online classes are the best medium of learning during a pandemic, they say that virtual sessions are no replacement for physical classrooms. While online classes prevent the risk of contracting the Covid-19 virus and provide multiple channels — e-mail, online chat, and video conferences — for teacher-student interaction, it comes with its cons, say teachers and health experts. Health experts have pointed out that attending online classes without a break leads to issues like decreased attention, sleep disorder and depression, especially among teenagers. The medical practitioners in the city told TOI that the cases of eye discomfort, fatigue, blurred vision, headaches, dry eyes, and other such issues have increased among students due to online classes. In fact, virtual classes make students more vulnerable to cancer and nervous system damage, added health experts. The online learning model has increased the workload of the teachers as well. Neelam Rawat, a senior school teacher at Vantage Girls’ Residential School in Dehradun, told TOI, “The workload has surely increased as we are now required to prepare presentations and incorporate different education tools like online quizzes to teach students. Online teaching is especially inconvenient for teachers who aren’t very tech-savvy.” She added that the biggest challenge in front of teachers during an online class is paying attention to every student in the session through a monitor screen. Meanwhile, Ananta Gurung, a Class XII student from Grace Academy, told TOI, “The pandemic has certainly disrupted our education. Even the board exams had to be cancelled. I am currently preparing for NEET. I hope the exam dates are finalised soon.” She, however, added that students are getting more time for self-study as the schools are running online classes.

This, he said, will help resolve the electricity issues in the area. Ticlo was speaking after an inspection of the Calvim bridge, based on complaints of water-logging and non-functioning of streetlights. “A proposal for a 33 KVA underground power line has already been prepared and now, another proposal has now been put up for an 11 KVA line, costing around Rs 92 crore. This will cater to four panchayat areas and help in solving the electricity problems here,” Ticlo said, adding that he is personally pursuing the matter with power minister Nilesh Cabral. “It is a big job, but I will surely try and get it done in my next tenure. Then there will be no more power failure issues,” he said. The MLA along with the officials from GSIDC, PWD, Aldona sarpanch Pranesh Naik and panchas inspected the Calvim bridge. The light fixtures on the bridge have not been functioning for the last four months. The issue was raised by some youth who had undertaken the task of clearing the bridge’s outlet chambers, choked with weeds, due to which rain water was accumulating on the bridge. The youth had also raised concerns over potholes in Nachinola, Moira, Calvim and other areas. They had themselves filled up the potholes on Calvim bridge to reduce inconveniences to commuters. Ticlo replied saying that the potholes on the bridge have been repaired with cement. The MLA meanwhile said that maintenance of both bridges, in Corjuem and Clavim, has been affected as GSIDC has still not handed them over to the PWD department. “I will speak to chief minister Pramod Sawant to get all the departments involved, including the panchas, to find a solution as the departments are blaming each other as one department is saying that the letter is done but the handing over is not done,” said Ticlo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/underground-power-cabling-to-be-taken-up-in-aldona-at-rs-92-crore-ticlo/articleshow/84282477.cms||---
---||Delhi||Kiwi vlogger fights to fly into India to reunite with wife||NEW DELHI: Karl Edward Rice, a New Zealand travel content creator, has been visiting India regularly for the past few years. Known popularly as Karl Rock, his travel videos were gaining popularity. Fascinated with India, he even got married to Manisha Malik, a resident of Pitampura in Delhi. He started learning Hindi, travelled the length and breadth of the country in every possible mode of transport and documented his experiences on his online channel. He last left India on October 10, 2020, went to Dubai, travelled to Pakistan for his travel videos and returned to Dubai. On December 27, 2020 when he sought his Indian visa extension in Dubai, the YouTuber with 1.8 million subscribers was informed he had been blacklisted. No reasons were given to him for the act. Rice said his wife wrote several times to the Union home ministry and visited the ministry in person to seek clarification, but to no avail. After a long wait, Rice visited the Indian high commission in Wellington, New Zealand, on April 30 and wrote a letter on May 25, requesting to know the reasons for his blacklisting so he could present his view on it. He also posted a trending video titled, ‘Why haven’t I seen my wife in 269 days?’ Asked if his visit to anti-CAA protests and his posts on the subject might have been the reasons for the blacklisting, Rice claimed that his wife’s family was too much in love with India to even contemplate moving to New Zealand. “My wife has sat for the civil services exams and I have myself donated plasma twice in Delhi and spoken highly of facilities here,” he said. Rice told TOI from Auckland that he wanted to return to India when Malik got infected with Covid-19 for the second time in April. Having heard of the oxygen shortage and growing deaths, he was worried about her. “In such a testing time I wanted to be with her. My wife is my guru who teaches me everything about India, she is my Hindi teacher and my inspiration,” he gushed. Rice, who lived in Delhi for almost three years before leaving for Dubai, claimed he used to visit either his father-in-law’s home in Hansi, Haryana, or his mother-in-law’s house in Churu, Rajasthan, almost every month. The YouTuber was clueless about how to challenge his blacklisting and was exasperated at not getting official responses to his queries. He went online to learn about the procedures to approach the central government and was advised by a lawyer to file a writ petition in Delhi High Court. “There is very little information available on how to challenge being blacklisted,” he shrugged. “Then I ran into a lawyer who handled such cases. I requested my wife to visit him and we finally filed a petition on his advice. My hopes of reuniting with my family now lie with the court.” While Rice claims to be following all the rules, home ministry officials said the New Zealand national had been restricted from entering India till next year because he violated the terms and conditions of his visa. “He engaged in business activities on a tourist visa and also violated other visa conditions,” one official alleged. Intelligence sources also claimed that Rice visited restricted areas without acquiring the necessary permissions. From filming his visits to numerous places across India, surprising locals with his Hindi, talking about ‘scams’ that foreigners should avoid while on a trip to India and taking a ship to Lakshadweep, Rice has extensively recorded his experiences in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kiwi-vlogger-fights-to-fly-into-india-to-reunite-with-wife/articleshow/84280237.cms||Amin Ali

Fatehchand Ranka, president of Federation of All Trade Associations of Pune, said, “We had written to the authorities with a request to revise the the timings to 11am-7pm, but we were not even been called for a meeting to voice our concerns.” Expressing his concern over the helplessness of owners of salons and beauty parlours in Pune, Ganesh Walunjkar, working president of the Maharashtra Nabhik Mahamandal, said, “It is not financially feasible for such business owners to keep their establishments open when there are no customers even during permitted hours.” Ganesh Shetty, president of the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association, said the members were disappointed with the decision . “The authorities had promised us that they will look into reconsidering their decision about the deadline for restaurants,” he said. There have been no norm relaxations in rural Pune from February. Narendra Gujarati, president of Baramati traders association, said, “The government needs to form a strategy to create a conducive atmosphere for traders.” Hotels, eateries and restaurants have not been permitted to start dine-in services in rural areas for the last four months. “People don’t come to collect takeaways in rural areas,” said Pandurang Kurhade, a restaurant owner in Khed tehsil. Similar sentiments were expressed by roadside dhabha owners in other tehsils. “We used to get advance bookings on weekends. But now there are no customers ,” said Sakent Jagtap, who runs a restaurant on the highway in Bhor tehsil. Sandesh Shah, a garment wholesaler from Shirur, said, “Big functions such as village fairs are cancelled. This has badly affected our business.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/prolonged-restrictions-leave-traders-consumers-at-a-loss/articleshow/84280192.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Delhi||Delhi: Colour-coded action plan to battle third Covid wave||NEW DELHI: Used to hearing about the graded response action plan (GRAP) in relation to pollution in the capital, the city will now have to get used to the same term being employed for the management of Covid-19 if the pandemic picks up again. Delhi Disaster Management Authority cleared the Covid GRAP on Friday, and it spells out four levels of economic restrictions that will come into force if the infection positivity rate moves from 0.5%, the lowest alert level, to above 5%, the highest. An expert committee has worked out a colour-coded mechanism with a yellow alert initiating the minimum level of restrictions and red the maximum. Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal discussed the mechanism at the DDMA meeting on Friday with experts and government officials. The alerts will be sounded through an official order by Delhi’s chief secretary. The CM said that GRAP will clear doubts about when the lockdown will be imposed or when it will be relaxed. For instance, Delhi Metro services will stop when the positivity rate crosses 2% and remains above 2% for two consecutive days. “There will be a sense of certainty and accountability on our part towards the people of Delhi,” said Kejriwal. “I don’t know if any other state has prepared such a plan for imposition and relaxation of a lockdown, but this is something that should be adopted at the national level too.” Delhi’s Covid positivity rate currently stands at 0.11%. The committee has suggested a yellow alert when the positivity rate goes above 0.5% and remains there for two consecutive days and a red alert if the positivity rate is over 5% for two consecutive days. Yellow alert would mean non-essential shops and malls open on odd-even basis between 10am and 8pm, restaurants operating on 50% capacity from 8am to 10pm and bars with 50% capacity from 12 noon to 10pm, Delhi Metro will be allowed to carry half its capacity of passengers, cabs and autorickshaws just two persons. Cinema halls, barber shops, spas, gyms and yoga institutes will be closed and night curfew will be in force from 10pm to 5am. The red alert will trigger a complete lockdown under which almost all economic activities will be prohibited, and Delhi will go under total curfew, though takeaways from restaurants, essential items through e-commerce outlets and limited construction activities will be allowed. Under amber alert and orange alert, a cusrfew will be in place from Friday 10pm to Monday 5am. A maximum of 20 persons will be allowed for weddings and funeral in the yellow and amber periods and 15 in orange and red. Under all codes, public gathering at religious places will be prohibited, though shrines may remain open. Schools and educational institutes will remain closed under all alert levels. GRAP also restricts the number of staff in Delhi government and private offices, but for central government offices, the decisions taken by the Centre will be implemented. DDMA also discussed the concerns arising out of new variants like Delta Plus. Dr V K Paul of the Niti Aayog, Dr Balram Bhargav of ICMR and Dr Randeep Guleria of AIIMS, among others, joined the meeting. Measures like vaccination, genome sequencing, testing, tracking and surveillance were suggested as the most effective steps to mitigate a resurgence of Covid-19. DDMA stressed upon the need for strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour. When GRAP is in force, people arriving in Delhi from other states will have to produce a certificate of full vaccination or a negative RT-PCR report not older than 72 hours, failing which they face institutional or paid quarantine for 14 days.

Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said the Punjab CM has ordered lifting of weekend and night curfew, allowing gatherings of 100 indoors and 200 outdoors from Monday onwards but with riders. Bars, cinemas, restaurants, spas, gyms, malls, discos, swimming pools and sports complexes allowed opening with staff and visitors taking at least one vaccine dose. Colleges and coaching centres are also allowed to open with vaccine certificates, but schools continue to stay shut, he said. In a first, Dayalan said, “Chief minister has ordered police to challan political leaders violating covid rules but hopes better sense will prevail on them.” DC said bars, cinema halls, restaurants, spas, swimming pools, gyms, malls, sports complexes, museums, zoos and discos will be opened subject to all eligible staff members and visitors having taken at least one dose each of the vaccine. “Though schools will continue to remain closed, colleges, coaching centres and all other institutions of higher learning shall be allowed to open, subject to a certificate having been submitted that all teaching, non-teaching staff and students have been given at least one dose of vaccination, at least two weeks ago,” he said. DC made it clear that all other SOPs will remain as is. However, ban on entering Punjab via Mohali has been lifted and now there is no need to produce 72 hour prior Covid negative report or one vaccination certificate. The borders from Himachal Pardesh and Haryana have been opened for unrestricted entry into Mohali, he said. BOX: One vaccine dose mandatory to visit Chhatbir With Punjab government allowing opening of all the zoos in the state, visitors will have to produce at least one dose vaccination certificate at the ticket counters of Chhatbir Zoo.

---||Delhi||AAP, BJP slam each other over desilting||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Friday alleged that the BJP-run municipal corporations had looted crores in the name of desilting of colony drains while not even 5% of these drains had been cleaned. North Delhi Municipal Corporation, he alleged, claims to have extracted 9,883MT silt and the south corporation 35,000MT, but no silt has been removed.The MLA warned that all colonies would be flooded during the monsoon. As the drains are full of silt, rainwater will overflow and come on main roads, he claimed. He challenged the south corporation commissioner to show him the colonies from where the silt had been removed.The corporation has paid Rs 30-40 crore to remove 35,705MT silt, Bharadwaj cliamed. “Why was this payment made if no work was actually done? A loot of crores has been made by politicians and officials. The payment was done to the contractors and later the same payment will be distributed,” he alleged. Bharadwaj said that in the past two and a half months, the public works department (PWD) had cleaned manholes on main roads. The work is still on, he added.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said Bharadwaj was habituated to make baseless allegations against the corporations to drive political mileage by maligning them. “He raised the issue against the corporations to cover up the failure of Delhi Jal Board, PWD and the flood department, which come under Delhi government, to desilt major drains,” Kapoor claimed. “Anyone can see that Barapullah, Najafgarh and Shahdara drains are overflowing. Delhi government departments were supposed to clean them up,” he said. The corporations have completed their work; but because connecting major drains have not been cleaned, small colony drains are unable to exit into them, he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-bjp-slam-each-other-over-desilting/articleshow/84278058.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chennai||Less than 20% of Tamil Nadu govt schools have internet||CHENNAI: Only one in five government schools in Tamil Nadu has internet facility. Of the 37,579 government schools in the state, only 6,746 schools (17.9%) have internet facility, said the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) report for 2019-20 released last week. The report comes at a time when internet facility has become one of the basic requirements for learning due to online mode of education during the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 80% government schools, however, have computer facility and most of them are functional. Among the 12,382 private schools in TN, however, 90% have computers and 75% have internet, the report released by the Union ministry of education said. Overall, of the 58,897 schools in TN, 32% schools have internet facility which is higher than the national average of 22%. In Kerala, 88% government schools have internet facility. “When schools reopen after the pandemic, internet will be one of the basic necessities for a school like water and toilet. Both teachers and students will need the facility for a hybrid mode of teaching and learning,” said Shyam Sundar, project director, Forum for Child Friendly Schools. There are possibilities that training of teachers will be completely online post-pandemic and all schools may need access to high-speed internet. “The state government should ensure computer and internet access to 100% schools. It will help to bridge the digital divide among rural and urban students,” he said. Experts pointed out that revised textbooks for Class I to XII are embedded with QR codes that can take education beyond classrooms and help students learn concepts through simple videos. But that will be dependent on teachers’ mobile internet. Educational activist B Oliver said computer-related courses needed to be part of school curriculum for primary students and the government may allow restricted internet usage for all students. “Computer is being used only for data entry purposes at government primary and middle schools,” he said. Officials from the school education department said all 6,029 government high and higher secondary schools have been provided with hi-tech labs with computers and internet connectivity. “The state government is trying to provide internet access to all students by creating a cluster of schools. The nodal school will have computers with internet access,” an official from the school education department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/only-20-of-tn-govt-schools-have-internet/articleshow/84278093.cms||A Ragu Raman

The timings will remain fixed on all planned session days. If the district or civic authorities want any change for some reason, they should make it public it in advance,” said Edke. “Most centre in-charges don’t publish timings for slots booked online. Beneficiaries have to often wait for long to fix their appointments,” a ZP official said. Dr Indira Parkhe, in-charge of a primary health centre in Khed tehsil, said, “Most beneficiaries prefer on-the-spot registration in rural areas. This hampers the drive’s overall planning.” Another health official said vaccine shortage has been a major issue for those in charge of the inoculation centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zp-directive-on-fixed-vaccination-timings/articleshow/84280243.cms||Sandip Dighe

Maharashtra added 200 Covid deaths on Friday and 121 deaths were reported on Thursday; however, 596 old deaths were added to the total toll on Friday and 318 were added on Thursday. With this, the state’s total death toll stood at 1,25,034. The state added 8,992 new cases on Friday, taking its caseload to 61.4 lakh .Mumbai added 596 cases and 13 deaths, taking its total tally to 7.2 lakh and deaths to 15,599. In the SDMA meeting on Friday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that with a warning of a third wave, there should be no shortage of essential medicines and other supplies. Officials said that there is pressure on the government to ease restrictions. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the task force, said the ‘thick tail’ is a worrying factor for states like Maharashtra and Kerala. “It is the reason why it may be premature to think about easing restrictions. We must implement stringent containment measures and focus on aggressive genome sampling,” he said. The official said that whether the state should do away with the requirement of an RT-PCR negative report and quarantine rules for fully vaccinated visitors is also being considered, and the task force has been asked to give its opinion on the issue. A meeting with the task force will be held once again next week for firming up any relaxations to be given. The state is expecting to receive results of over 1,000 samples that have been sent for genome sequencing. “Our chief worry is still Delta and not Delta-plus as of now,” said a state official. Dr Joshi said that unlike the north, where the second wave appears to have ended, the virus is in active transmission in Maharashtra and Kerala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-old-deaths-take-toll-up-in-2-days-by-over-1000/articleshow/84280261.cms||Sumitra Debroy

State medical secretary Saurabh Vijay said instructions had been issued to the government hospitals to collate the data for the study. State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said breakthrough infections could occur, but they had so far been observed to be mild to moderate. “Breakthrough infections need independent study and investigation to understand the immune escape phenomenon. Therefore, they should be randomly sequenced for genomic sequencing,” he said. Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology division at ICMR, said a small proportion of fully vaccinated people would be sick, hospitalised, or die due to Covid-19. “Studies in India and abroad have reported breakthrough infections. These observations suggest vaccine breakthrough cases by highly transmissible viral variants can potentially disrupt the management of Covid-19 pandemic. So, it is necessary to continuously generate viral genomic sequences from positive samples to identify potential vaccine breakthrough mutations in each state,” he said. Kant said, it was important to emphasise the vaccines were effective and safe, and all those eligible must take the shots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-study-on-breakthrough-infections-on-the-anvil/articleshow/84280232.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The highest coverage is that of Dadra and Nagar Haveli with 73% coverage of a single dose while the national average for a single dose is 22%. According to Dr Rijo John, adjunct professor at Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kochi, who analysed existing data, 18 states/UTs have vaccinated more than 30% of their population with at least a single dose. At least one in four persons in 24 states/UTs have been vaccinated with at least a single jab. “The seven day average jabs has decreased to 41 lakh per day compared to 64 lakh per day two weeks ago in the country,” said Dr John. In Chandigarh, 9% people have taken both doses, which is seventh highest among states/UTs. However, Himachal Pradesh has more coverage than the city, with 46% people having received a single dose and 11% fully immunised. Punjab’s coverage is 20%, which is below the national average for a single dose, while Haryana has 28% coverage. “We are going to old age homes and RWAs, now we shall cover a few colleges in the city so that the 18+ group is not left behind,” said director, health services, Dr Amandeep Kang. She added, “Before we get the third wave, we need to enhance vaccination coverage so that we do not allow another wave to affect our city.” Besides the routine morning round, UT health department has also started evening sessions for vaccination. “There are some who have to go to work in the morning, so we have evening sessions for them. We will soon reach households through societies and social groups for vaccines,” said the director, health services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-gets-9th-rank-in-terms-of-vaccination-coverage/articleshow/84278110.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Pune||Pregnant women testing positive can opt for inoculation after delivery, say experts||PUNE: Health experts have emphasized on sensitizing the masses about the Union government’s norms on vaccinating pregnant women against Covid-19 if they have had the infection. The guidelines have made it clear that such expecting mothers should be vaccinated soon after delivery. However, if the pregnant woman is highly exposed and more at risk of contracting Covid-19 due to the nature of her job, crowded living or preexisting health conditions, then she can defer the vaccination for 12 weeks from the onset of infection (symptoms) or four to eight weeks from recovery, the guidelines specified. “Pre-existing co-morbidities, advanced maternal age and high body mass index are risk factors for severe Covid -19 during pregnancy. These women have a greater risk of severe illness from Covid-19, hence, they should opt for vaccination 12 weeks from the infection or four to eight weeks from full recovery,” said gynaecologist Pankaj Sarode. Besides, pregnant women working as healthcare or frontline workers and living in a community with a high or increasing rate of Covid-19 infections should also not wait till delivery to get the shot. He said pregnant women who are frequently exposed to people outside the household and face difficulty in complying with social distancing should also not wait till delivery. “They should take the vaccination 12 weeks from the Covid infection or the four to eight weeks from recovery,” Sarode said. Covid-19 infection during pregnancy may result in rapid deterioration of pregnant women’s health and could also affect the fetus. The health experts are of the view that the benefits of vaccination to pregnant women outweigh its potential risks. Based on the recommendations from the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI), the ministry of health and family welfare has approved vaccination of pregnant women against Covid-19 with the condition that they be informed about the risks of exposure to Covid-19 infection, along with the risks and benefits associated with the Covid-19 vaccines available in the country. Health activist Abhijit More stressed on public education. “The state government and respective district administration should adopt mass media tools like radio, television and newspapers to sensitise people about the benefits of Covid vaccination in pregnant women as there is a lot of hesitancy among this subset of the population.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pregnant-women-testing-ve-can-opt-for-inoculation-after-delivery/articleshow/84280287.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Going to the nearest college meant travelling one way for at least two hours. With the belief that future generations of his village and surrounding areas should have equal opportunities, the 30-year-old has decided to send a letter signed by 100 other people living in different villages to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. The 100 people who have signed the letter belong to Paprawat, Daurala, Ghumanhera, Jhatikara, Rawta and Shikarpur villages. The initiative was started by Delhi Dehat Sangathan (DDS) when it was heard that the campus of Delhi Sports University was being set up in Mundka in west Delhi. The residents have been pressing demands for the educational institutions because both Delhi University (DU) and Ambedkar University (AUD) possess land in these areas. Ashwani said, “For the past several years, we have been hearing that colleges will come up here. However, we have completed our studies but still nothing has happened. Travelling for several hours is not safe or feasible for students.” DDS member Deepak Yadav said, “When land has already been allotted to AUD and DU, then why should the youth of our area lose out on educational opportunities?” DU was given land at Roshanpura in the 1990s, while AUD was allotted a plot in Ghumanhera in 2017. Yadav, an alumnus of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, had to travel for almost 33km one way to attend classes at Maharaja Surajmal College. “If anyone wants to enrol in DU, they have to register either in Shivaji College or Rajdhani College where the choice of subjects is limited. For women, there is at least Aditi Mahavidyalaya, but even that has limited courses. Just because we live in villages doesn’t mean we should not get equal opportunities. An RTI filed by me revealed that the matter was stuck due to delay in the departments. I have sent those documents to the LG and CM too,” said Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/100-residents-from-villages-seek-equal-edu-opportunities/articleshow/84280317.cms||Shradha Chettri

The decision comes less than a year ahead of the next assembly elections in the state. Chief minister Amarinder Singh had on August 26, 2020, decided to extend the benefit to the descendants of freedom fighters in Punjab. According to a letter issued by chief engineer (commercial) of PSPCL, to implement the order, lists of bona fide successors up to grandchildren of the freedom fighters have been sought from various districts in a week’s time. Existing beneficiary categories get 200 free units, including SCs, BCs, BPL and freedom fighters’ families. After the AICC-appointed three-member panel asked chief minister Amarinder Singh to provide 300 units of free power to all families in the state, AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal made an announcement last month that his party too will offer a similar benefit to all households in Punjab if it forms the government in 2022. Meanwhile, the Congress government is yet to make an announcement about an electricity benefit for general category consumers in the state as promised by AAP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/freedom-fighters-kin-set-to-benefit/articleshow/84283752.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation fixes 6 dedicated Covaxin sites, PCMC & Pune rural to follow suit||PUNE: Covaxin beneficiaries will no longer face confusion about their vaccination centres with PMC fixing six exclusive sites for it, while PCMC is in the process of finalizing at least three dedicated sites in its jurisdiction. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that he recently directed PMC, PCMC and Pune rural to fix dedicated Covaxin centres in their jurisdictions for the benefit of citizens. “Now, Pune city has a fixed number of Covaxin centres, which was not the case earlier. Earlier, Covaxin centres would change every other day, with frequent rotation of sites offering either of the two vaccines. To avoid this confusion, the respective authorities have been asked to fix exclusive Covaxin sites, on the lines of District Hospital Aundh, which is a dedicated Covaxin centre since the vaccination drive began,” he said. Pune district has a higher number of Covishield centres and fewer Covaxin sites. Frequent changes in the sites offering Covaxin have prompted many to take to social media to enquire about the centres offering the particular vaccine. Dr Deshmukh said PCMC and Pune rural will also announce the exclusive Covaxin centres in their limits within a day or two. “PCMC has been asked to start three such sites, preferably at bigger government hospitals at easily accessible locations,” he said. Mumbai resident Prem Prakash has been searching for free Covaxin sites since the last six days, but has been unable to get a CoWIN booking. “On Friday, I asked the PMC about which centres they were offering Covaxin. Unfortunately, I received an automated response from them on a social media website. The response did not even mention the vaccination site names,” he said. A PMC official said the six Covaxin centres were started recently. “The six sites will offer both, first and second Covaxin doses. Earlier, Covaxin was only being offered for first doses at government centres. On Friday, each of these centres was offering 200 doses of the vaccine,” the official said. A PCMC official said, “We are in the process of fixing Covaxin centres in a day or two. For Saturday’s drive, however, two sites will be offering Covaxin as the process of designating fixed sites is still under way.” On Friday, PMC and PCMC were out of Covishield stock and only administered Covaxin. However, Pune district received fresh stocks of both Covishield and Covaxin on Friday, which would help vaccinations to continue in PMC, PCMC and Pune rural as normal on Saturday. PCMC officials said only first Covishield doses would be given to beneficiaries in the age group of 18-44 in the PCMC limits on Saturday, while those above 45, healthcare and frontline workers will be given both Covishield doses. Covaxin (first and second dose) will be available at two PCMC sites on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-fixes-6-dedicated-covaxin-sites-pcmc-pune-rural-to-follow-suit/articleshow/84280315.cms||Neha Madaan

The final mock tests are scheduled from Monday. While students can be seen taking the demo mock test in ‘Halloween’ makeup with a wig and scary visage, some can be seen dancing to the number — ‘Saiyan ne dekha aise, ki main pani pani ho gayi. In other videos, boys can also be seen taking the test in a vest. In the first video, a student copied hand movements of actor Jackeline Fernandes, who features in a popular Hindi rap, and is seen making funny sounds with hand moves. The screen of AKTU demo-mock trials is visible in the background of videos, which was shared by varsity students. “Many students of our class have given the exam wearing a vest and circulated their videos on Whatsapp groups. Also during the demo, whistles and funny sounds were recorded and circulated,” said B.Tech (mechanical) student Abhinav Singh. AKTU spokesperson Asheesh Mishra said, “Since it was a demo mock test, we did not impose curbs on students. This was just a trial run. During the main examination, students won’t be allowed to appear if not dressed properly. Also, strict online invigilation will maintain decorum. Indiscipline can debar them from the examination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/halloween-to-rap-aktu-students-mock-at-demos/articleshow/84282263.cms||---

Pregnant women who develop Covid-19 are more likely to require intensive care than their non-pregnant counterparts, experts said. “We have asked our health staffers to counsel pregnant women registered for antenatal care at PMC- and private-run maternity homes about taking the Covid vaccine. The response from them has so far been very low. We have also urged corporators to do their bit to increase awareness,” said Vaishali Jadhav, chief of the PMC’s Covid vaccination programme. In rural parts of Pune, Zilla Parishad started vaccinating pregnant women from Friday. “We vaccinated 31 pregnant women across 17 blocks in the district on Friday. Barring Daund and Amebgaon, the response was extremely low across other blocks,” said Ayush Prasad, Pune ZP CEO. The administration will also sensitize pregnant women living in rural parts about the importance of vaccination on the ninth day of every month. District immunisation officer Sachin Edke said a special online training session for health staffers working at primary health centres has been conducted to acquaint them with the drive. “We have directed primary health centre heads to hold counseling sessions on vaccination for pregnant women at village level,” Edke said. Harish Lohar, Wade Bohlai PHC’s in-charge, said they couldn’t carry out vaccination for pregnant woman in their limit due to unavailability of doses. “But we have chalked out a comprehensive plan of such vaccination. We aim to cover at least 20 pregnant women daily,” he said. Pavan Salve, additional health chief, PCMC, said they were currently focusing on creating awareness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/efforts-on-to-tackle-vax-hesitancy-among-expecting-mothers/articleshow/84280306.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Delhi||Gurugram man who cheated six banks of Rs 7 crore held||NEW DELHI: A swindler, who allegedly managed to mortgage the same commercial property to six different nationalised banks and availed a loan of Rs 7 crore, was arrested by Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police. The accused, Rajiv Rathee, is a resident of Sector 4 in Gurugram. Police said Ratnakar Bank Ltd and Bank of Maharashtra had filed complaints alleging that Rathee of ‘Shagun Enterprises’ had approached them for availing home loan and was willing to mortgage a property in Gymkhana Club, Sector 4, Gurgaon. “After verification, banks sanctioned the loan to Rathee on the same property at different times. RBL Bank sanctioned Rs 2.5 crore and Bank of Maharashtra sanctioned Rs 1.3 crore,” said RK Singh, additional commissioner (EOW). Later, when the applicant failed to maintain a financial discipline, banks were under the process of symbolic possession and gave advertisement in newspapers, police said. It was then the banks came to know that the same property was also mortgaged with Allahabad Bank. EOW filed an FIR and started a probe, which revealed that Rathee had opened a firm, M/s Shagun Enterprises, at Shahadara Industrial Area in 2013 on rent. He had opened the firm just to take loans with the intention to cheat the banks. Then, he took a factory on rent to show the bank official during their visit and managed to get the credit facilities for the same. “After getting the loan, he went underground. Efforts were made to trace him, and he was finally tracked down to Gurgaon,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-who-cheated-six-banks-of-rs-7-crore-held/articleshow/84280351.cms||---
---||Delhi||AAP, BJP target each other over desilting||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Friday alleged that the BJP-run municipal corporations had looted crores in the name of desilting of colony drains while not even 5% of these drains had been cleaned. North Delhi Municipal Corporation, he alleged, claims to have extracted 9,883MT silt and the south corporation 35,000MT, but no silt has been removed. The MLA warned that all colonies would be flooded during the monsoon. As the drains are full of silt, rainwater will overflow and come on main roads, he claimed. He challenged the south corporation commissioner to show him the colonies from where the silt had been removed. The corporation has paid Rs 30-40 crore to remove 35,705MT silt, Bharadwaj cliamed. “Why was this payment made if no work was actually done? A loot of crores has been made by politicians and officials. The payment was done to the contractors and later the same payment will be distributed,” he alleged. Bharadwaj said that in the past two and a half months, the public works department (PWD) had cleaned manholes on main roads. The work is still on, he added. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said Bharadwaj was habituated to make baseless allegations against the corporations to drive political mileage by maligning them. “He raised the issue against the corporations to cover up the failure of Delhi Jal Board, PWD and the flood department, which come under Delhi government, to desilt major drains,” Kapoor claimed. “Anyone can see that Barapullah, Najafgarh and Shahdara drains are overflowing. Delhi government departments were supposed to clean them up,” he said. The corporations have completed their work; but because connecting major drains have not been cleaned, small colony drains are unable to exit into them, he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-bjp-target-each-other-over-desilting/articleshow/84280363.cms||---

I have directed the police commissioners to take strict action against them,” Pawar, who is also the district guardian minister, told the media. Responding to reports of crowding at tourist spots during weekdays, he said the police have been told to ensure there was no Covid protocol violation at such getaways. Pawar urged citizens who have been vaccinated not to be complacent about the Covid protocols. “Even if people have received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, they should always wear masks while going out. The state task force and health experts have directed people to strictly follow Covid protocols even after vaccination,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/with-positivity-rate-at-6-pune-to-continue-with-level-3-curbs-ajit/articleshow/84280358.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Finance secretary SS Rawat dismisses ‘missing funds’ allegations||AMARAVATI: Principal finance secretary SS Rawat on Friday dismissed the TDP’s allegations that funds were missing from the treasury. Stating that it’s not possible to violate well-regulated accounting rules and procedures in the release of funds, Rawat said no monies have been withdrawn in violation of AP Treasury Code, as is being alleged. “The principal accountant general (A&E) compiles the accounts of the state every year and during the process of compilation, observations will be made and referred to the finance department for remarks. The remarks would be dropped after a satisfactory clarification was issued. This was a standard, yearly practice and there is nothing new,” he explained. On Thursday, the TDP appealed to governor Biswabhushan Harichandan to get a “full-fledged audit of the AP finance department carried out by the comptroller and auditor general of India (CAG) in view of accounting lapses involving Rs 41,000 crore of public funds for 2020-21”. It also demanded an audit of overall state finances for both 2019-20 and 2020-21 financial years to detect the “irregularities” and prevent the same in future. TDP MLA Payyavula Keshav, who is also the public accounts committee chairman, met the governor and submitted the memorandum. “The state government should be answerable to the public and to the assembly as to why there were no vouchers, receipts and bills for Rs 41,043.08 crore government spendings. The truth should come out whether these massive accounting lapses were deliberately carried out,” he said. Rawat clarified that all transactions were carried out as per procedure and as per the provisions of AP Treasury & Financial Code.

He was 81 and is survived by his doctor wife and two doctor sons and their families. Prof Chandra was also the principal of King George’s Medical College (now KGMU) from 1998-2000 and served as the head of the plastic surgery department for 18 years (1980-1998), longest in the history of KGMU.

BSP claimed that Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri’s remarks were also on the same lines and their anger was aimed at both parties. The motorcycle march passed through several villages of three Garhshankar, Ropar and Anandpur Sahib constituencies. Ot covered 60km in over four hours. Led by BSP state president Jasbir Singh Garhi, BSP cadres first paid obeisance at a Ravidas shrine in Khuralgarh. On reaching Anandpur Sahib, the protesters paid obeisance at Takht Kesgarh Sahib and three other historic gurdwaras, including of Bhai Jiwan Singh. BSP, apart from targetting Congress’s support base among Dalits, is trying to create a connect between Sikhs and Dalits, especially those who are inclined to BSP’s Dalit identity politics. Garhi said they would continue raising the issue. “Sikh gurus identified with downtrodden and 10th Sikh master, Guru Gobind Singh, empowered them. But Bittu and Puri made remarks which smacked off casteism and projected as if BSP - a party of Bahujans and Dalits – could not contest from Panthic seats. We prayed at Takht Kesgarh Sahib to seek blessings of Guru Gobind Singh to fight against casteist Congress and BJP,” he said. Just after the seat sharing between SAD and BSP was announced, Bittu had reported said that SAD left out Panthic and pavitar (sacred) seats Anandpur Sahib and Chamkaur Sahib for BSP, which reacted by describing Bittu’s remarks as outright casteist. The party said he considered Dalits and Bahujans apavitar (impure). Bittu has given a clarification, but the party has not left the issue. Later, Puri also put a query to SAD without naming any seats and his comments appeared subtle. While Congress has major support base among Dalits, BJP has been trying to woo Dalits and had even played the Dalit card by announcing that if voted to power in Punjab it would have a Dalit CM. With its continuous attacks, BSP is aiming to dent Congress and to prevent BJP from any expansion among Dalits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bsp-protest-over-bittus-seat-remarks/articleshow/84283755.cms||IP Singh
---||Lucknow||HC seeks DGP’s reply on torture of retd soldier||Prayagraj: Hearing a plea filed by an ex-soldier of the Indian army alleging humiliation and brutal torture by the UP Police, the Allahabad HC, after taking into account the injury reports and FIR filed by him, on Thursday observed that “prima facie, it shows a very sorry state of affairs, police atrocities and a breach of fundamental rights of the petitioner by the accused police officials.” A division bench comprising Justice Surya Prakash Kesarwani and Justice Gautam Chowdhary directed the UP DGP to file a counter-affidavit by means of his personal affidavit, indicating the action taken in the matter. P 4 Hearing a writ petition filed by Resham Singh, an ex-soldier of the Indian army and the victim, the court requested the advocate general of UP to assist this court in the matter and fixed the matter for hearing as a fresh case on July 12 for further hearing. A video of the said incident had gone viral on social media. On May 2, Resham Singh, along with his mother and two sisters was going from Pilibhit to Lakhimpur Kheri when they were stopped by the police officials at around 9 am. The police then asked for the papers of the car in which they were travelling. Allegedly, since it was taking some time to sort out the papers, the police officials abused the victim and his mother and two sisters. The victim asked the police officials to not abuse them and also informed that he was a retired member of the armed forces. This infuriated the cops who threatened the victim and his family members that they will teach them a lesson for life, the petition says. They then started abusing and beating the victim with lathis. Allegedly, the police officials also beat his mother and sisters and took them to the police station without taking the assistance of any woman police officer, it adds. The petitioner alleged that the victim was disrobed and tied on a cot at the police station and brutally beaten up by the said police officials for two continuous hours. They also gave him third degree torture only to satisfy their ego. Thereafter, he lodged an FIR against the erring officials and took treatment in the army hospital. Five days later, eight policemen were suspended and a probe was ordered by senior officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-seeks-dgps-reply-on-torture-of-retd-soldier/articleshow/84282337.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

While the chariots could not roll in 2020 due to the pandemic, this year there will be no sea of humanity greeting the Holy Trinity.  The curfew on the route of the procession will ensure that citizens have to glimpse the Lord of the World from their homes.  “We are happy that we will carry out the procession,” said Mahendra Jha, trustee of the Jagannathji temple during a media interaction on Friday. “We are committed to following Covid guidelines.”  Jha told the media that for the first time, there will be two batches of chariot pullers. “The first batch will pull the three chariots from the temple to Saraspur, and the second will pull them from Saraspur to the temple,” he said. He added that there will be no stopping on the route, and there will be only a five-minute break at Saraspur for the exchange while chariots are greeted for the mameru ritual. There will be 20 chariot pullers from the Khalasi community for each chariot. They will need a negative RT-PCR report to participate“Every year, the chariots and the car of the mahant are greeted at 200 places on the route, but this time there will be no such events. We appeal to all to watch the procession on TV, and not to approach the streets,” said Jha. Mahant Dilipdasji also appealed to devotees to pray from home. The temple authorities said the sprouted green gram, given to citizens as prasad during the procession, will be distributed from the temple premises. “Considering the demand from the devotees, the prasad will be distributed till Guru Purnima (July 24). It will not be given out along the route,” said Jha. Pradipsinh Jadeja, MoS (home), along with senior officials including state DGP Ashish Bhatia met the temple authorities to give final shape to the preparations. City police also carried out a rehearsal on the route, indicating that there would be the usual scale of police deployment even as the procession has been scaled down to five vehicles. Jadeja, talking to the media after the discussion, said the procession is a matter of faith for millions. “We are organizing it with all due precautions. There will be 20 chariot pullers from the Khalasi community with each chariot. All will participate after a negative RT-PCR test,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/two-shifts-for-chariot-pullers-prasad-at-temple/articleshow/84280506.cms||---

The petition stated till 2020, activists and nearby residents had protected the lake from encroachment and debris dumping. However, in February 2020, before the lockdown, the land/slum mafia cleared most of the lotus plants; debris and garbage were dumped on the lake and huts sprouted in the area. Times ViewThe high court’s direction to restore the lake is a welcome relief for all those fighting to protect this natural resource. This seems to be a flagrant attempt to encroach the wetland by the land mafia. The local authorities need to be more proactive to save the lake and not wait for judicial orders.The petition blamed Cidco saying it has remained negligent despite the high court order of 2014 that applied the doctrine of public trust in environment law - where the state is a trustee for all natural resources – to DPS Lake and P S Chanakya Lake as well as for protection of other lakes within Navi Mumbai. Patole’s petition said Cidco contends the lake is not a wetland and has itself begun dumping debris and waste in it. Advocate Satyajeet Rajeshirke for Patole showed a picture of the lake with lotuses before the lockdown. While Cidco was not represented by an advocate in court, NMMC’s advocate Sandeep Marne said relief is sought against Cidco. The judges said NMMC and CIDCO are planning authorities and instead of pointing to each other “must work together and the problem should be solved.” “We would also take precautions for it,” Marne assured. The judges said they were not passing any order. “Next week we want a statement that the debris is removed and the lake is restored to its original position,” the Chief Justice said. The judges were hopeful Marne “will use his good offices with NMMC and see to it that the order is complied with.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/clear-debris-restore-neruls-lotus-lake-says-bombay-hc/articleshow/84280418.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The ACB teams arrested the accused, Sajjan Singh Gurjar, from Ajmer on Friday. Gurjar, a resident of Dausa, had demanded the money on the pretext of arranging good marks to secure selection in the coveted RAS exams of 2018. Sources in the ACB said that they used dummy cash to trap the accused. “We had kept the dummy cash under the original currency notes of Rs 1 lakh. He (Gurjar) was so enthralled seeing the cash that he did not see that most of them were dummy currency of one Manoranjan bank,” an official said. ACB DG BL Soni said that the agency had received a complaint that Gurjar, a native of Dausa district, was demanding bribe for good marks in the RAS exams of 2018. ACB then verified the complaint and laid a trap, following which, on Friday, an ACB team led by additional SP (ASP) Himanshu Kuldeep caught the accused red-handed while taking the bribe in Ajmer. ACB officials said that searches were underway at different locations of the accused. “A case under the Prevention of Corruption Act will be filed against the accused,” an official said. The agency, however, did not reveal if the accused was bluffing to the complainant, or if he indeed could ensure higher marks for the interview.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rs-25l-bribe-for-marks-in-rasexam-rpsc-jr-staff-in-acb-net/articleshow/84280448.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Ranchi: Sadar hospital work way behind schedule||RANCHI: A day after the Jharkhand high court took strong objection to the unfinished work at the Ranchi district hospital and directed the implementing agency to complete the work at the earliest, a visit to the hospital revealed that 15 different kinds of work that were supposed to be completed by June 30 were either still incomplete or progressing at a very slow pace. The construction agency, Vijeta Projects and Infrastructure Limited, engaged in the construction and installation of services at the hospital told the court on Thursday that 84% work has been completed and it will be completing the rest of the work soon. However, if the progress report submitted by the district administration is to be believed, a copy of which is with TOI, the claims of the contractor seem to be false as there hasn’t been any progress or very slow progress on 15 kinds of works and services that were supposed to be completed by June 30, 2021. The works and services include water supply provisions to the eight-storey building, sewer system, electrical wiring and fittings as well as external electrical work, fire detection system, construction of hospital kitchen and modular operation theatres, among others. Jyoti Sharma, who has filed a contempt petition at the Jharkhand high court after the contractor failed to honour three deadlines, said: “The court asked the contractor as well as the state when they would be able to complete the work. The next hearing is on July 15 and I do not think that they will be able to complete what they have said in the last hearing.” The claim of 84% work being completed by the contractor seems false as health department officials said the agency has been dumping the materials but aren’t finishing the work. Also, oxygen supply to beds and electrical power backup have not been completed. Waterlogged roads and open drains are a common sight at the district hospital. Ambulances ferrying patients, too, have to cross the waterlogged passage to reach the emergency ward. Ranchi civil surgeon Dr Vinod Kumar said: “I have visited all the floors after the hearing on Thursday and I do not think that the contractor will be able to complete the work in even the next six months. They claim to have completed 84% of the work but I do not think it is more than 70%. “ Notably, the construction of the 500-bed super-speciality project started in 2007 and it is yet to be completed with the original budget inflating from Rs 127 crore to almost Rs 350 crore now. “I had joined as a medical officer in 2007 when this building’s construction had started. I have been promoted at least thrice since then but the project is yet to be completed,” a senior health department official said. When contacted, an engineer associated with the project said: “The major bottle-neck is the non-payment to the smaller vendors that are working on the ground. Vijeta Construction has been defaulting on their payments and that is the reason the work is getting delayed. We have mentioned all these in our report to the high court.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/sadar-hosp-work-way-behind-schedule/articleshow/84277285.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Front-ranking steel manufacturing companies based in Bokaro and Giridih, which manufacture pellets, iron wires, duct pipes and TMT bars, have claimed their production is being hampered due to the state mining department’s delay in renewing the leases of the state’s merchant iron ore mines. The manufacturers have estimated that steel production in Jharkhand has dropped by nearly 26% from the last fiscal. In FY-2021, the state produced 20.8 million tonnes (MT) of steel compared to 28.2 MT in the 2019-20 FY. “There is little or no output of iron ore from merchant iron ore mines in the state. The merchant iron ore leases in Jharkhand expired in 2020, and in the last year, these mines have not been producing any ore leading to an acute shortage of iron ore for steel manufacturers in the state. This is creating huge challenges for steel manufacturers,” the management of a leading steel making company said, requesting anonymity. “What is making matters worse is that some of the existing iron ore suppliers have tied up with local manufacturers, thereby starving Jharkhand-based steel manufacturers of their required iron ore. For example, in Odisha, the Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC) is providing assured supplies to Odisha-based buyers under a long-term linkage policy. Similarly, the government-owned Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) is also selling iron ore from its captive mines in Odisha and Chhattisgarh to local players. There have, however, been no sales from Jharkhand mines. In fact, SAIL has cancelled auctions that it had held in Jharkhand for its local iron ore mines,” the management of another Giridih-based company claimed. While mines secretary K Srinivasan and officials of the Jharkhand State Mining Development Corporation (JSMDC) did not respond to TOI’s calls, a highly placed official in the state mines directorate said: “The leases of the mines were suspended in March last year after a revision by the Centre in its MMDR Act. At present, none of the steel plants in Jharkhand has been forced to shut their production due to lack of iron ore. However, we are currently in the process of renewing the leases. It will take time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/steel-companies-urge-govt-to-expedite-lease-renewal-of-iron-ore-mines/articleshow/84288267.cms||Dhritiman Ray

He also asked the officers to constitute a research and design team to scout for better industrial prospects for the state. During a review meeting of the industries’ department, Soren said, “Jharcraft products are of good quality and in demand. However, there is no adequate supply of its products in the market. Jharcraft needs to be run professionally and efforts should be made to find new markets for its products.” He added, “The state has ample prospects in lac and silk industry, but there has not been much of a progress in these two sectors. A research and design team needs to be constituted to enable the commissioning of industrial processing units for lac and silk in the state.” A statement issued by the government said the meeting was also attended by chief secretary Sukhdev Singh and industries secretary Puja Singhal. Notably, the government had said the objective of the new industrial policy was to fetch investments worth Rs 1 lakh crore and provide employment to five lakh people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/form-team-to-market-jharcraft-products-cm/articleshow/84277491.cms||Dhritiman Ray

BJP, along with members supporting it, formed committees as the coalition holding majority stayed away. The general board meeting was scheduled to appoint chairpersons of various committees. However, on Thursday evening president of the municipality Sanjay Soni ‘postponed’ the meeting in wake of the death of thespian Dilip Kumar. Drama, however, began at the auditorium where the meeting had been scheduled after the BJP members along with supporters, broke open the lock of the auditorium and held the meeting. A meeting was convened and the BJP-led coalition formed the committees for various departments in the civic body. Soni said that the entire exercise was held under pressure and the officials acted on the instructions from their higher ups to hold the meeting. “The president can convene or postpone a meeting,” he said. At one end, those who held the meeting have argued that any postponement should have been done after starting the meeting and not before it began. At the other end, the officials and those who attended the meeting held that there was a quorum and the meeting could be convened. It was also alleged that corporators of the ruling coalition were squabbling among themselves for being appointed as chairpersons of committees and this had forced them to try and postpone the meeting. Soni, however, said that he had a paper with signature of a majority of members seeking postponement of the meeting. Godhra municipality has 44 members, of which 18 are from BJP, seven from AIMIM and one from Congress. The remaining members are independent. Godhra police had reached the municipality hall in large numbers to prevent any untoward incident. In the past too, tempers have run high in the municipality hall where meetings were being held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/high-drama-in-godhra-civic-body-meet-over-key-panels/articleshow/84280059.cms||---

The state had instructed all districts to roll out vaccination for pregnant women by next week following the Centre’s recent nod on July 2. Over 20 lakh women will be eligible for vaccination in the state, including 1.5lakh in Mumbai. BMC has decided to open up the drive at medical colleges, maternity homes and peripheral hospitals handling childbirth. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said 25-30 centres have been identified. Based on the response, the corporation would add more, she said. On Thursday, the state immunisation department held training sessions on counselling corners, seating and separate queues for vaccination. Hospitals, clinics and maternity homes, which women visit for check-ups, will be roped in as counselling centres. “Counselling is the most crucial key here. We have decided that places women visit for regular antenatal check-ups will counsel and inform them about the risks and benefits of vaccination. After they are counselled, they can head to the vaccination centres. We will provide education material to such places,” said Dr Dilip Patil, head of state immunisation. The Centre had said pregnant womenmust be given information needed to make an “informed choice”. For pregnant women who may directly land up at a vaccination centre, Dr Gomare said, centres will station experienced staff. “They will also be informed about reporting adverse events, which is vital,” she added. Gynaecologists have rooted for vaccination for pregnant women for months since studies found higher deaths and severe outcomes in them due to Covid, especially in the second wave. Researchers believe the new variant B.1.617 could have played a role. “Pregnant women should consider vaccination on priority for themselves as well as the safety of the child in the womb,” Dr VK Paul, member-health, NITI Aayog, said on Friday. He said chances of preterm birth, stillbirths and other complications have been found to be higher in pregnant women. Dr Samiran Panda, head, division of epidemiology and communicable diseases, ICMR, advocated vaccination for lactating mothers. "Antibodies developed in the mother as a result of vaccination get passively transferred to the baby while breastfeeding and could be helpful to the child," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-open-up-vax-drive-for-pregnant-women-on-monday/articleshow/84279866.cms||Sumitra Debroy

They would ask the kin of Covid-19 patients to transfer money into their accounts for home-delivery of oxygen cylinders. Each of those 24 victims were duped anywhere between Rs 8,000 and Rs 20,000 for a cylinder. The victims lodged separate FIRs with the Hazrat Nizamuddin police and Kalkaji Police stations in the national capital.

The girls were languishing in different rescue centres of the national capital for over a year as their return was delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the non-completion of required processes, including getting permission from the local child welfare committee and the police besides address verification. Among the rescued girls, eight each are from Gumla and Sahebganj districts and five from West Singhbhum district. The others belong to Bokaro Dhanbad and Simdega districts. Among them is a girl who is only eight years old. One of the rescued girls is a 17-year-old from Godda district. She lost her father at the age of seven. After studying till Class VII, the girl wanted to support her mother who worked as a labourer. She eventually came in contact with an agent, Ajmat Ansari, who started physically exploiting her in name of providing her job in cities. Ajmat brought the girl to Delhi and sold her at Shakarpur. After a tip-off, the IRRC rescued the girl along with another from a brothel in Sukur Vihar. Two traffickers were also arrested in the operation. After arrival at the railway station, one of the girls said, “My employers put a burden on me with lots of work. He scolded and beat me when I was unable to fulfil all his orders.” The children were now handed over to the district child protection officers (DCPO) concerned at the railway station. Sanjay Mishra, secretary of Bal Kalyan Sangh, which runs the IRRC said, “The DCPO has to rehabilitate the children in their respective districts. The children and their parents would be linked to different social welfare schemes of the state government. The state resource centre will take regular feedback about the condition of the children,” He added after the girls turned 18, they would be trained in various vocational courses like security guards so that they readily find jobs to be in the social mainstream.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/26-minor-girls-brought-back-to-state-1-yr-after-their-rescue/articleshow/84276793.cms||Sanjay Sahay

It was on March 7 this year that volunteers associated with NSS Techo had organized the first ever online self-defence camp. With participants registering for the camp, it was recognized as the biggest ever held on a virtual platform. Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India also appreciated it on its official Twitter handle. “The camp was organized with the objective of spreading awareness among the youth and making them learn the basic techniques of self-defence.

The peak was astronomical, over 2,000% in three months. At the same time, official data of the health department showed that the situation was pretty much under control. Between March and May, the official death toll during the second wave was just around 4,500. But the registration figures put the number for three months at 12,560, nearly three times what the health department had published. There were striking disparities in the number of people who died of Covid in Kerala in April and May. When registration figures showed that April and May recorded 1,554 and10,602 Covid deaths respectively in Kerala, the health department’s figures for the corresponding periods were 687 and 3,507 respectively. Between April and May the caseload had more than doubled from 4 lakh to 9 lakh. The health department, overwhelmed by the uncontrollable surge, almost lost the count of people who died of Covid-19, which reflects in the difference of 7,095 deaths between the registration figures and health department’s official data. The severity of fatalities in May, as shown in registration figures, was such that more than 30% of total death registrations in 10 districts in May was because of Covid-19. The pattern of death registrations in local bodies changed drastically in 2021. In 2020, the difference was minimal — 3,072 deaths were declared officially and 2,347 deaths were registered as Covid fatalities. In 2021, official declaration was made for 10,163 deaths. However, the local bodies registered 17,237 Covid deaths till June. The officials say normally there is a time lag between the date of death and date of registration except in very few local bodies and even on that count, the number of Covid death registrations has outnumbered the official figures in 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-12560-kerala-3-month-covid-toll-3-times-of-what-state-disclosed/articleshow/84284978.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||India||SC notice to Odisha, J&K & Chandigarh in ‘love jihad’ case||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday sought responses from Chandigarh administration and governments of Odisha and J&K on the plea of an Odia couple who sought rescue of their pharmacist daughter from ‘love jihad’, a term that entered the annals of the SC through Hadiya-Safin Jahan case from Kerala in 2017-18. A bench of Justices UU Lalit, Ajay Rastogi and Aniruddha Bose issued notices to the government in the case that spanned three state and UT jurisdictions after hearing arguments from Sudarsh Menon, who narrated the story of the woman’s parents being unable to trace her after her marriage to a Muslim man in Chandigarh. He said she vanished into the hinterland of Chandigarh. The SC asked respondents to file counter affidavits by July 23, the next date of hearing. Parents — Kabita and Kedarnath — moved a habeas corpus petition in the SC apprehending threat to their daughter’s life. The girl studied B Pharm with the man from J&K at Odisha’s Berhampur before moving to Lucknow and then to Chandigarh in pursuit of job and then marrying and finally disappearing into J&K’s Bandipora, to which the man belonged to. The parents said they were not opposed to interfaith, inter-caste or inter-religious marriages and declared that they wouldn’t harm their daughter if she married a Hindu, Christian or a Muslim boy of her own choice. They said they apprehended that their daughter has been coerced into marriage. They said they learnt that he man to whom their daughter was married was engaged in a crime syndicate which “is playing with the lives of Hindu girls.” The parents said they went to Chandigarh and tried to bring their daughter with them but their efforts failed. “The Muslim man and our daughter moved the Punjab and Haryana HC for protection. The petition was later withdrawn and the couple disappeared,” they alleged. “We’re unable to contact her and fear that the crime syndicate may coerce her to do illegal acts or acts detrimental to national security. Her phone is switched off and we don’t know her whereabouts,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-notice-to-odisha-jk-chandigarh-in-love-jihad-case/articleshow/84284988.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Since September last year, Punjab has failed to get rid of the most unwanted record of having the highest death rate in the country which at present stands at 2.7%, more than double the all-India average. Not only that, Punjab and Maharashtra (2.02) are the only two states in the country with a death rate of over 2%. The state’s two-week fatality rate has gone up from 6.09% to 6.42%. As many as nine districts have recorded a rise in the cases fatality rate (CFR) from July 1 to July 7 in comparison to the death rate between June 1 and June 30. Mansa has topped the list as its death rate went up from 7.6% to 27.1%. During the period, 84 people infected with the virus died and of these 13, the highest death count in the state, were in Mansa. In Ferozepur, 10 people lost their lives and pushed the death rate from 5.6% to 16.7%. Similarly, in Hoshiarpur, Fazilka and Kapurthala, six deaths each were reported increasing the fatality rate from 2.5% to 7.8%, 5.5% to 8.6% and 6.2% to 11.1%, respectively, in these three districts. A drop in the fatality rate has been noted in 13 districts. The death rate in Tarn Taran and Nawanshahr dropped to 0 which earlier was 13.6% and 8.6%, respectively. Moga and Patiala witnessed a reduction of death rate by 3.9%, 3.7% in Sangrur, 3.3% in Gurdaspur, and 2.7% in Mohali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fortnightly-death-rate-at-new-high-of-6-42-in-punjab/articleshow/84285011.cms||Vinod Kumar

---||Delhi||Two passersby killed in firing at Delhi realtor||NEW DELHI: Two passersby lost their lives in north Delhi’s Filmistan Road area on Thursday night when some criminals fired at a property dealer, who was sitting in his car. The main target managed to save himself by running for cover and hiding in a shop. The assailants then gave up the chase and left. One of the victims, Sanjay, 25, was walking on the footpath when he was hit in the neck. He used to do odd jobs and was at that late hour too looking for work in the buses parked nearby. The other man, possibly in his thirties, was shot near his lungs. He is still to be identified. The spot is just 100-150 metres from the Bara Hindu Rao police post. The incident happened at 9pm and the PCR received a call at 9.21 pm. Property dealer Mohammad Naeem, who had a narrow escape, told TOI he was at his brother’s nursing home, Sanjida Hospital, which is under renovation. Bullets rain on N Delhi street barely metres from police postA man wearing a black T-shirt tried to enter the building, asking whether it was a vaccination centre. He was asked to leave. Minutes later, when Naeem left the hospital and stepped into his car with his nephew Munim and office boy Prakash, the same man tried to intercept him. After a scuffle, he left but returned with two others, and the next moment they started firing. Recalling the incident, Munim said at least a dozen rounds were fired. He told TOI that the man had been told by Prakash to go to some other hospital since their hospital was shut. He, however, seemed reluctant to leave. “After this, when we all sat in the car, the same man stood in front of the car to block our way. When despite repeated honking, he refused to move, we sensed trouble. Meanwhile, some locals had been drawn to the spot by the commotion and they beat him up, asking him to leave,” recalled Munim. “They even escorted him out.” The car must have moved barely a few metres when another person came towards them followed by the man in a black T-shirt and a third person. “They opened fire even as we ran out of the car. I hid near a transporter’s office while my uncle and the office boy hid at a shop. After some time, the assailants left in an i10 car and an auto-rickshaw. There could have been more of them. This has been recorded by a CCTV camera,” said Munim. Going by what Naeem and Munim have told them, the police suspect that it is a fallout of the former complaining about an illegal construction taking place in the Walled City area. Locals said Naeem was a well-known person in the area and worked as a social activist who helped people. “We have given some names to the police. Even I had got some threat calls a few days back but had not reported it to the police,” added Munim. Naeem is taking care of the nursing home after his brother, Vakil Ahmed, passed away on April 29. Vakil, too, was allegedly receiving threats from a Meerut-based gangster and had complained to the police. “Four teams have been formed to crack the case. We have some clues and raids are being carried out,” said DCP, North, Anto Alphonse. Till late evening, police had detained one suspect and said property angle could be the reason behind the shooting. The prime accused had hired the shooters for the job. Police said the shooters may be from northeast Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-passersby-killed-in-firing-at-delhi-realtor/articleshow/84285010.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Goa||Climate change concerns need to be woven into coastal plan: Greens||Panaji: Goa along with other coastal states has been facing the brunt of extreme weather events occurring more closely than ever before. Activists said that despite this, the impact of the climate crisis has been overlooked in the draft coastal zone management plan (CZMP). A series of cyclones in 2019 and 2020, extremely heavy rainfall that caused unprecedented flooding, and even a hail storm more recently has made experts realise that the close sequence of these events is evidence of climate change. “The CZMPs should have focused primarily on the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, increasing strength and frequency of storms and flood events, loss of biodiversity and populations of species, but has completely failed to meet this mandate of the CRZ Notification 2011,” Abhijit Prabhudesai of Federation of Rainbow Warriors said. With the sea level rise likely to be in the range of a metre in the near future, the ramifications are likely to be catastrophic for Goa, as many parts in low lying areas would be submerged. Beaches would face greater erosion and cultivable land would be lost. Even settlements could face threat from these extreme weather events. Promoting sustainable development with threats of natural hazards in coastal areas, especially sea level rise, is one of the objectives of CRZ Notification 2011. Goa’s vast khazan lands, reclaimed from low lying areas and water bodies, were ingeniously crafted by local communities in the hoary past. They were by design linked to flood prevention systems, comprising creeks, ‘poims’ and other water bodies, which have also been missed out in the plan. “Many of these important creeks having tidal influence such as Thane in Cortalim, Mattvem in Dabolim, Zorint in Sancoale, and Vaddem near Goa Shipyard at Vasco have not been marked on CZMPS. Failure to mark these would result in their reclamation,” Caelan da Costa, a youth from Chicalim, said at the public hearing on Thursday. Goa’s flood prevention infrastructure needs to be studied to cope with impacts of climate change. In recent years, many water bodies that acted as balancing reservoirs during monsoon have been filled up. “It is inevitable that existing flood prevention systems, including the low-lying retention systems and drainage systems, must be studied and demarcated on the plans,” Prabhudesai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/climate-change-concerns-need-to-be-woven-into-coastal-plan-greens/articleshow/84279548.cms||Paul Fernandes

The South Goa collector will be solely responsible if any of the participants or speakers contract Covid-19 as social distancing norms were flouted,” he said. Members of the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) and the South Goa collector failed to pay heed to the objections raised on the 15-minute restriction imposed, violating public hearing norms and EIA notification 2006 and procedure to conduct a public hearing, Simoes said. “Only 50 speakers could speak from nearly thousands who had registered, which has violated the EIA notification 2006 and procedure to conduct a public hearing,” he said. NFF has demanded that all objections received from fishermen’s organisations, panchayats and civil society should be incorporated in the final plan, failing which, it threatened to take GCZMA to task. “The CRZ was established to protect and conserve coastal ecology and traditional dwellers and their livelihoods. Unfortunately, due to the delay in implementing a proper CZMP we have lost kilometers of coastline. We cannot afford to lose more.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hearing-violated-curfew-order-says-fishing-body/articleshow/84279668.cms||---

Madhya Pradesh’s Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) has written to Indian Council of Medical Search (ICMR) to prescribe the black meat of Kadaknath chicken to those recovering from Covid-19 infection for its healing properties. It helps that it’s downright delicious. The iron-rich Kadaknath meat is packed with nutrients. It has less than 2% fat, compared to around 25% in normal poultry, and has been part of the traditional diet of Bhil and Bhilala tribes, who call it ‘Kali Masi’. MP has GI registry of Kadaknath, which is native to MP’s Jhabua region. KVK senior scientist and head Dr IS Tomar has written to ICMR that Kadaknath meat, eggs, and soup will greatly help in post-Covid recovery as it is full of nutrition. ‘Kadaknath meat has all required nutrients’Kadaknath meat contains polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) --eicosatetraenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) – plus zinc, vitamin C and other vitamins, essential amino acids, and, of course, iron that gives the meat its characteristic black colour. “These nutrients are key in maintaining immune function. As we know, nutritional therapy appears to be the first line of treatment for post-Covid patients,” Tomar points out in the letter. “Kadaknath chicken has all the nutrition required to nourish the human body. It has very low cholesterol and fat, which has been confirmed by the National Meat Research Centre (NMRC, Hyderabad). Its benefits have also been published in an international journal,” Dr Tomar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/kadak-soup-for-the-soul-madhya-pradeshs-prescription-for-post-covid-recovery/articleshow/84285061.cms||Sagar Choukse

On Saturday, Goyal is due to meet industry representatives in Mumbai to get a first-hand understanding of the issues and challenges confronting them, before he holds similar consultations in Surat, Ahmedabad and Coimbatore. The minister had met his ministry colleagues on Thursday and identified the priority areas with job generation topping the list given that it is a labour-intensive sector. “The Government will try to give a big support to the income of all the people employed in this sector, especially women,” he had said. The minister believes that textiles has crucial links with commerce and industry and with the charge of the two ministries he believes he can tap into the synergies that are on offer, something that PM Narendra Modi has also sought to focus on while realigning the portfolios. Since last year, the commerce and industry has been working with the textiles ministry to work out a plan to scale up domestic production and exports with textiles being among the 24 sectors identified for priority action. From these, production linked incentive schemes have been announced for 13 sectors, with nearly Rs 2 lakh crore to be spent over the next five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/goyal-looks-to-tap-textiles-synergy/articleshow/84285107.cms||---

The law was enacted last year by the state government to prohibit forced religious conversions. The woman, a 35-year-old, has alleged that Mohammed Rafi had pretended to be from another religion when he introduced himself. When she discovered the truth, she says, he forcibly changed her name on the ration card and other such documents. Kolgawan police station in-charge, DP Singh Chauhan said, “The complainant and accused Mohammed Rafi lived together for 15 years. For the past one-and-a-half years, she lived separately. She had alleged that the accused identified himself as ‘Rakesh’ when he first met her. When she came to know, he forcibly changed her name on some documents,” he said. Satna SP Dharmveer Yadav said the case was registered against Rafi on the basis of her complaint, and a court sent him to jail on Friday. Rafi has been booked under IPC and sections 3, 4 and 5 of Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act, said Chauhan.

---||India||Prasad’s 5-year tenure saw Ayodhya & Rafale cases settled, old laws junked||NEW DELHI: After more than five years as minister for law and justice, Ravi Shankar Prasad leaves a legacy for successor Kiren Rijiju that began with enactment of the controversial National Judicial Appointments Commission and covered a spectrum including Ayodhya and Rafale cases. Prasad’s tenure, from July, 2016 to July, 2021 in addition to holding the portfolio from May 2014 till November 2014, was second only to legendary senior advocate Ashok Sen, who was law minister from May 1957 till January 1966. Prasad would now surely resume his lucrative practice in the court after ministership. Prasad’s innings as law minister under PM Narendra Modi in 2014 began with the signature reform legislation in NJAC, which intended to replace the collegium system of judges selecting candidates for appointment as judges, a system which had been frowned upon by both judiciary and lawyers as well as public as opaque though largely considered as a process independent of the executive. But the legislation, passed unanimously by Parliament, and ratified by more than 20 states, was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015, which felt that presence of the law minister in the judges’ appointment commission would cripple judicial independence, appointments being intrinsic to it. In the succeeding year, friction between the judiciary and executive became apparent with government through the law ministry objecting to several recommendations for appointment of judges on one or the other grounds. And yet, when questioned both administratively and judicially, by the Supreme Court for the seemingly vengeful stalling of appointments, Prasad rolled out statistics to dispel the perception. He said in 2016, the Centre appointed a record 126 HC judges against a yearly average of 70-80 judges in the past decade. A landmark was the resolution of the dispute over the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land at Ayodhya. A five-judge bench unanimously awarded the title of the land to the Hindus, while giving an alternative five acre plot to Muslims to build a mosque. His tenure also saw the law ministry handling several litigational controversies including Rafale purchase deal, spat between the CBI Director and Special Director and the politically sensitive National Herald case. But, he always took pride in the repealing of nearly 1,500 archaic laws that had been clogging systems for decades. His tenure also saw the setting up of the National Judicial Data Grid and digitisation of 15,000 trial courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/prasads-5-year-tenure-saw-ayodhya-rafale-cases-settled-old-laws-junked/articleshow/84285142.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Increase in supplies was critical, given the gradual opening of sectors conditional to stakeholders having taken at least one dose, said the chief minister, directing the officials to continue pursuing aggressively with the Centre for enhancement of the state’s quota. Pointing out that Punjab had already vaccinated nearly 83 lakh eligible persons (approximately 27% of population), the chief minister said that the stock was being utilised in the state without any wastage.

Kapurthala SSP H P S Khakh said accused Daljit Singh Shera, a resident of Kartarpur, Jalandhar, was caught in Cyberabad in Telangana. The cop said, “On the evening of June 18, the accused, along with his associates, had shot dead Mukul when he was returning home from a playground. The accused suspected Mukul’s involvement in the murder of their gang member.” Police had registered a case against four persons on the statement of the victim’s father. Daljit took responsibility for the murder and also wrote a post on his Facebook account. “Police teams were chasing the accused since the day of the murder, but Daljit was constantly changing his hideouts in different states like Haryana, UP, Bihar, Maharashtra and Odisha. He was finally traced to Telangana. The car he had robed from a pastor in Tanda was later recovered from Maharashtra as the accused had left it there after the vehicle developed a snag,” the SSP added. On June 29, the police teams were on the way to raid his hideout in Telangana when they learned that Daljit tried to rob some girls of cellphones at gunpoint. The scared girls dialed 100 after running towards the main road, following which Gachibowli police reached the spot. The SSP said the police teams arrested him there and brought him back to Punjab on Friday. The weapons used in the murder of Mukul have also been seized by the Telangana police. “We are on the lookout for other three accused,” the cop added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/murder-accused-held-after-1900km-chase/articleshow/84283724.cms||---

The publisher, the International Institute of Management and Entrepreneurship (IIME), has has taken the decision following a probe ordered by the Raj Bhavan. TOI has a copy of the letter issued to all 27 VCs by IIME, stating that it took them 18 months to publish the 'well-researched pictorial and lyrical account' of of the life of governor Mishra. “If the book is not of any use, you are requested to return the same,” the letter said. The IIME had released the biography at the governor’s house on July 1. Without the consent of the VCs who were present during the occasion, they loaded 19 copies of the book into the cars of the VCs and gave a bill of Rs 68,383 each. After the matter snowballed into a major controversy, on July 5, the governor's house denied knowing about any such move by the publisher and, on June 6, ordered a probe into the issue. The letter said that it was a usual practice to sell books during book launches. “We didn’t know that there was a particular protocol not to sell books at such programmes. It happened out of misunderstanding,” the letter said. “I have received the letter from the publisher. detailing Every university, except a few, will surely return the books as it has no academic value,” said one of the VCs requesting anonymity. A source at the governor’s house said that the probe has started against the publisher. “It is certain that the publisher's affiliates and connections in different ministries are going to be impacted by the move,” said a source.

The police department has given permission to the ISKCON management to organize the rath yatra that will be held on July 12. However, the public won’t be allowed on the route from where the procession will pass. The timings of the yatra too have been changed. “A curfew will be imposed in the areas from where the procession would pass. People won’t be allowed to come on the roads to take darshan of the lord as we want to avoid big crowds. The state government has already issued notification in this regard,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner. The procession will start at 9 am and it will end within two hours. Singh said that the procession’s route has also been reduced by one-and-half kilometers. “We will deploy four companies of state reserve police (SRP), joint police commissioner, six deputy commissioners of police, 10 assistant commissioners of police and over 1,000 policemen on the procession route,” Singh added. As per the guidelines, only those persons whose RTPCR tests are negative 48 hours prior to the rath yatra day can participate in the procession. No prasad will be distributed to the devotees on the route of the procession.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/jagannath-yatra-to-roll-out-amid-curfew/articleshow/84280198.cms||---

The assembly entrusts PAC to examine the state government expenditure and scrutinize audited accounts of the government by the Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG). The speaker plays a determining role in deciding the PAC chairman from among 20 PAC members. Bengal parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee welcomed the speaker’s ruling. “Mukul Roy is still a member of the opposition. The speaker announced his name following procedure. We support the speaker’s ruling,” he said. BJP members staged a walkout from the assembly soon after Speaker Biman Banerjee announced Roy’s name as PAC chairman while calling him “a distinguished member of the opposition” with vast experience in parliamentary affairs. Roy’s election as PAC chairman was in consonance with the parliamentary tradition followed in the assembly for the last 54 years. The die was cast for Roy getting the coveted post the day chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced that her party Trinamool Congress would support him as PAC chairman, weeks ago on June 24. Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari, also a PAC member, blamed Trinamool for breaking the tradition of working with the opposition in the House. “The speaker had asked for names of chairman for nine other standing committees from BJP chief whip Manoj Tigga. The BJP senior turned down the offer. We will participate in assembly discussions because people sent us here. We will also participate as members in discussions of the asembly standing committees. But none of our party MLAs will accept chairmanship of the committees,” Adhikari said. The BJP leader complained that the speaker went out of the way and chose Roy though his name was not on the list of six the party had forwarded for the speaker’s consideration. Roy won assembly elections on a BJP ticket and is considered an opposition member of the House, the reason why the speaker allotted Roy a seat in the opposition benches beside the leader of opposition. Adhikari has already filed a 64-page complaint to the speaker pleading for Roy’s disqualification as MLA under anti-defection law. The speaker has called him for hearing on July 16. Adhikari refused to buy the official argument. “The whole world knows that Mukul Roy joined Trinamool on June 11. The opposition didn’t send his name to the speaker. We instead wanted noted economist and BJP Balurghat MLA Ashok Lahiri to become PAC chairman because he deserved it,” he said. Adhikari also drew a difference between Roy’s election as PAC chairman and that of Manas Bhunia in 2016. “We as opposition didn’t send Mukul Roy’s name to the speaker. But in 2016, the opposition Congress and Left had sent Manas Bhuniya’s name as PAC member. Bhuniya was a Congress member then. He joined Trinamool days after. But Roy has already joined Trinamool,” Adhikari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mukul-elected-pac-chief-bjp-snubs-offer-of-top-post-on-other-panels/articleshow/84280909.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||Kolkata private hospitals run low on vaccine stocks, two stop drive||KOLKATA: A majority of private hospitals in the city are yet to receive their quota of Covid vaccines that they have ordered and paid for on the CoWin portal after the new procurement policy came into effect on July 1. While two hospitals were forced to stop vaccination this week after exhausting their stocks, at least two others are administering only the second dose to make their vaccines last till fresh consignments arrive. Most of these hospitals had already placed direct orders with the manufacturers before the procurement policy changed in end-June. These orders were cancelled and they had to place fresh orders through CoWin and are now awaiting delivery. Fortis Hospital, which has ordered 50,000 doses for July but is yet to receive any, ran out of stock on Wednesday and stopped its vaccination drive. All three branches of ILS Hospital, too, have ran out of vaccines. “We have not received anything this month,” said an official. The AMRI Hospitals have ordered 1.5 lakh doses for its three units on the portal but have received nothing. “Our stocks are depleting fast. At present, our three units at Dhakuria, Mukundapur and Salt Lake are administering 1,200-1,500 doses every day, while 300-350 doses are being administered at our off-site camps. Our stocks will last a week more and we are worried,” said CEO Rupak Barua. Peerless Hospital has requisitioned 7,000 doses under the new system but has received nothing yet. “We paid for the doses on the portal and are anxiously waiting for it since our stock has come down to just 2,000 doses. This has forced a rationing of doses and we have stopped the first dose. Till recently, we were administering 550-600 doses a day but now we have cut it down considerably,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Stocks haven’t reached RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) since last month even before the system changed. “We put up a fresh requisition for 35,000 doses for July and have already paid for the same. A payment had been done for 9,500 doses in June, refund of which is expected soon,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. “We are currently managing with our existing stock of around 6,000 doses of Covishield and 3,000 doses each of Covaxin and Sputnik,” he added. Payments made by hospitals prior to the switch to the new system are to be refunded. “We have been told that the payment we made in June – against which we received nothing since the system changed – will be returned. But that doesn’t help unless the new system takes off and we receive fresh doses,” said Sudipta Mitra of Peerless. Under the new system, each private vaccination centre has to apply on the CoWin portal mentioning their Covaxin and Covishield requirements. The maximum they can order is thrice their average daily vaccine consumption between the 19th and 25th of the previous month. Payments are made directly on the National Health Authority (NHA) portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-pvt-hosps-run-low-on-vax-stocks-2-stop-drive/articleshow/84282336.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Suvendu Adhikari’s guard death; widow files police plaint||CONTAI: A primary school teacher has lodged a formal complaint against the “suspicious death” in October 2018 of her husband, who was then employed as Suvendu Adhikari’s security guard. Suparna Kanjilal Chakraborty, a mother to two daughters aged 12 and 9, lodged her complaint on Wednesday night. It has now been turned into an FIR for murder and criminal conspiracy against “unknown miscreants”. Her husband Subhabrata Chakraborty, a state armed police personnel, was found with a gunshot injury in his head in police barracks in Contai in 2018 and died in a Kolkata hospital the next day. East Midnapore police superintendent Amarnath K said: “We received the complaint on Wednesday night. The matter is being investigated. Till it is complete, it is very difficult to comment.” In the three-page complaint letter, Suparna says she didn’t lodge the complaint earlier though she had her suspicions because “Suvendu babu was a powerful district and a state leader, and everyone was scared to speak against them”. Suvendu was then the Bengal transport minister. Suparna questions how a person employed as Suvendu’s security guard can be found with a bullet wound in his head and also asks about the “delay” in providing him medical treatment in Kolkata that night. She also mentions that when her brother-in-law questioned the post-mortem delay and findings, Rakhal Bera (a Suvendu aide now in custody in a fraud case) had shut him up. Asked about this on the sidelines of the assembly session, Suvendu said: “This is over a two-and-a-half-year-old case. They cannot intimidate or scare me with these. Legally whatever needs to be done will be done. To the best of my knowledge, a chargesheet has already been filed in this case.” Criminal lawyer Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee said: “There are multiple legal avenues to reopen investigations in light of fresh evidence. Even when a chargesheet is filed, there can always be a supplementary chargesheet later. But to reopen old cases with grave penal clauses like murder, the person accused also has a right to defend.” Trinamool state spokesperson Kunal Ghosh took to Twitter and Facebook to post the FIR copy and the complaint and tagged Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh to ask: “Do you or your central team know this family and this lady? Her husband was the security guard of your leader. Kindly go through her appeal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suvendu-guard-death-widow-files-police-plaint/articleshow/84280979.cms||Suman Mandal
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: CM Mamata Banarjee meets Prashant Kishor ahead of likely TMC rejig next week||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee met poll strategist Prashant Kishor for three hours at her Kalighat home on Friday ahead of Trinamool Congress implementing the “one-person-one-post” formula next week. Four cabinet ministers — Jyotipriyo Mullick, Pulak Ray, Swapan Debnath and Soumen Mahapatra — hold positions of district party presidents. They either need to quit their ministerial berths or party positions. Party secretary general Partha Chatterjee had on June 5, immediately after CM Banerjee announced the one-person-one-post rule, said this rule would be implemented across all party levels. Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee had been pushing this agenda through. According to party insiders, meetings over the last few days were also to deliberate on the timelines and strategy for pending state-wide civic polls and elections to Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC). It is largely believed some cabinet ministers will have to lead civic poll battles. “In that case, it will also necessitate a cabinet reshuffle,” a leader said. Officially, the party has not made any formal comment on impending changes. Civic polls have been due in Bengal since June 2020 but had to be deferred due to the pandemic. The Bengal elections delayed it further. However, party leaders believe with cases on the slide, the elections should not be further deferred. The Bengal government has already informed Election Commission of its readiness to hold seven assembly bypolls and polls to the two vacant Rajya Sabha seats in the state. According to party insiders, the state is also mulling civic polls around the same time once EC gives its nod for the assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-meets-pk-ahead-of-likely-tmc-rejig-next-week/articleshow/84280893.cms||---
---||Kolkata||IIM-Calcutta parity blow as fewer women make cut||KOLKATA: The admission of fewer women in Indian Institute of Management-Calcutta (IIM-C) this year has come as a blow to the premier B-school’s attempt to strive towards gender parity in its flagship two-year MBA programme. Whereas 35% of the 2020-’22 batch were women, the ratio has dipped to 31% in the 2021-’23 batch, the same level as four years ago. The ratio of women at the institute was barely 16.6% in the 2016-’18 batch before efforts were made — in pre-interview screening and through increased weight in shortlisting — to improve the ratio to 31% in the 2017-’19 batch. The other major IIMs — IIM-Bangalore and IIM-Ahmedabad — had also posted better gender and discipline diversity that year. Faculty members at IIM-C expressed disappointment at the dip in gender ratio. “The IIMs have been continuously aiming to achieve gender parity and encourage more women students to join the institute. This dip in numbers this year is disheartening. We hope that more women make the cut into IIM-C next year,” said a faculty member. This year, 149 in the batch of 480 students are women, down from 171 in 2020. A year prior to that, in 2019, only 144 in the batch of 480 were women. In 2017, there were 145 women in a batch of 462, up from barely 77 women who had joined in 2016. It isn’t confirmed whether fewer women took the Common Admission Test (CAT) this year, sociologist and Presidency University professor emeritus Prasanta Roy felt one of the reasons behind the dip in the number of women students making it to IIM-C could be due to families’ hesitation in investing in Common Admission Test coaching, given the further investment of Rs 23 lakh required for the MBA programme thereafter. “An admission to IIM involves monetary sacrifices for families. In a pandemic year, when everyone is impacted, the situation becomes more acute. Some could have reconsidered and made a choice to not enrol their daughters due to budgetary constraints,” he said. Megha Sharma, chairperson (Admissions), IIM Calcutta said, “Compared to last year, there has not been any change in the admission policy. Therefore, the change cannot be attributed to the admission criteria.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iim-c-parity-blow-as-fewer-women-make-cut/articleshow/84282502.cms||Somdatta Basu

It took only about 40 days for Bhopal to unlearn all the lessons it learned during the chilling second wave. Residents have to continue following the strict Covid guidelines to reduce the risk of third wave. Reducing crowds at picnic and tourist spots has more to do with encouraging behavioural change, but crowding at market places is an administrative issue, say traders. Nobody wants crowding but unless and until market closure time is increased to 10.00 or 11.00pm, the crowd of shoppers during evening can’t be controlled, argue traders. “There is marriage season till July 15 and Eid-ul-Zuha is round the corner. So, people are coming out to shop and they will shop for an auspicious occasion in the family or a festival. Crowds in markets during marriage or festival season is a usual phenomenon. Focus should be on better management of crowd,” said Vinod Agrawal, who has a textile shop in Chowk Bazar. Taslim Raza, who has a footwear shop in Ibrahimpura, said “Crowding in market places is more due to early closure of shops rather than carelessness by individuals. In the afternoon, the weather is hot and people don't prefer to come out of their houses. In the evening, shops close by 8.00 pm and police are there asking for closure of shops at 7.30 pm itself, so people are left with 2 hours to shop and therefore, there is so much of crowd in markets during the evening hours.” Ramesh Garg, a textile merchant at Lakherapura, had a different view on why people are buying things, which they may not immediately need. "Even before the lockdown restrictions were eased, the media, experts, administration and the government talking about the third wave and speculations are rife as to when it will hit the country and our state Madhya Pradesh. It has made people indulge in panic buying again as you are never sure when lockdown will be back and once it's in place, when it will be lifted.” General secretary of Bhopal Thok Kirana Vyapari Mahasangh, Anupam Agrawal, also argued that advancing closure time of markets to 10.00pm or 11.00pm could be the only way crowds in the markets are controlled. "We have given an application to the district administration urging them to advance the closure time of markets to 10.00pm or 11.00pm as the Indore administration has done. People are buying for marriages and Eidul-Zuha today, the auspicious month of Sawan will come next and then you have a string of festivals till Diwali. If everyone is shopping at the same time and you have markets of different commodities adjacent to each other as in the old city, markets will obviously get crowded,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/crowd-returns-to-market-so-does-fear-of-covid-spread-in-bhopal/articleshow/84285169.cms||---
