New Delhi and Kabul share deepened economic and trade links despite uncertainties about achieving a political settlement to the lingering conflict in Afghanistan. India has invested over $3 billion in reconstruction and relief work since 2001 when US-led troops drove the Taliban out of Kabul. Delhi still firmly supports President Ashraf Ghani‚Äôs government. In an interview with a local TV channel, Gen Iftikhar said that "spoilers" (an indirect reference to India) were trying to hold Pakistan responsible for the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan prompted by the announcements of withdrawal of US and Nato forces from the war-torn country. "But there is no truth is these allegations. The world is very well aware that Pakistan has made every effort to solve the Afghan issue, without violence and according to the wishes of the Afghan people," the military spokesperson said. "Pakistan is still a facilitator of this peace process and not a guarantor," the general said. Responding to a question about whether the US should remove itself completely from the region, he said there was only one requirement from the US: a responsible withdrawal from Afghanistan. "What that meant was their exit would have happened after a transition. But it happened a little quickly. I think that it has been said with a lot of clarity that there is no question nor requirement of bases for the US," Gen Iftikhar said, adding that the regional powers were well capable of resolving the issue. "So you are saying the Americans are not needed, that they can leave?" the interviewer asked. "No, I don‚Äôt think they are needed," he replied. When asked about the perception in Afghanistan that the Taliban would come to power, he said: "We need to understand that if that happens, that would be the decision of the Afghans. No one will dictate this decision from the outside."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/indias-investment-seems-sinking-in-afghanistan-warns-pakistan-army/articleshow/84303562.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

But on Saturday morning, several rowdies in the city were taken aback when they saw cops at their doorsteps. The pre-dawn raids came in the backdrop of three recent daylight murders in the city. Police searched 2,144 houses of history-sheeters and anti-social elements and questioned 1,548 of them about their activities in the last few weeks. The nearly eight-hour raid began at 5am. Ganja, lethal weapons and vehicles without documents were seized. ‚ÄúOn Friday, deputy commissioners of eight divisions listed out the names and addresses of rowdies and miscreants in their respective divisions. A meeting was held in each DCP‚Äôs office at night where officials briefed the action plan. We were also looking at the involvement of these anti-social elements in drug peddling and land mafia,‚Äù a senior officer said. As directed, officials from 112 law and order stations in the city left their stations by 4.30am. ‚ÄúTeams were led either by an assistant commissioner of police, inspector or a sub-inspector, depending on the criminal background of the miscreant,‚Äù an officer said. The raid came as a surprise to most miscreants, but not for some. ‚ÄúHistory sheeters living in the west and south divisions, which witnessed murders recently, seem to have anticipated it. As we visited the houses of some hard-core criminals, we found nothing; not even a small knife, which is strange,‚Äù a police officer told STOI. Former corporator Rekha Kadiresh was murdered in the west division while financier N Madan was killed in south division recently. At least 12kg of ganja and 91 lethal weapons like machetes and daggers were recovered. No pistols or revolvers were found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/city-cops-raid-over-2000-houses-of-rowdies-409-in-preventive-custody/articleshow/84303648.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: TenderSURE work stalled on Jayanagar road for two years||BENGALURU: A 1.3km stretch of 11th Main in Jayanagar 5th Block looks like it has been strafed on one side. Broken cobblestones, pipes and heaps of debris are all over the pavement and the road. This has rendered walking, riding and driving in the direction of JP Nagar a risky proposition for two years now. Jayanagar residents are irked over TenderSURE work being stalled on the road two years ago. It began nearly five years back and ground to a halt due to fund crunch. Work from JP Nagar towards South End Circle was completed, but is pending in the other direction. The Jayanagar road was among five stretches taken up under TenderSURE at a cost of Rs 86 crore. While work on Nrupathunga Road, KG Road and Modi Hospital Road was completed, Siddaiah Puranik Road and Jayanagar 11th Main were not as lucky. Sukumar O, who‚Äôs been a resident of 5th Block Jayanagar for nearly 20 years, said, ‚ÄúBefore TenderSURE work started, the road needed work but was at least motorable. It‚Äôs not even in that condition now. Gravel and debris have rendered the carriageway uneven, resulting in several vehicles skidding. The pavement has heaps of debris, making it impossible for pedestrians to walk on it.‚Äù When STOI visited 11th Main, heaps of silt and sand were seen on the edge of the road, covering five feet of the road width in some places. There was no place for pedestrians to walk safely. ‚ÄúWe have written to several authorities, including MLA Sowmya Reddy and MP Tejasvi Surya. There has been no help from their end. At this point we don‚Äôt know whom to contact and how to go about getting this work completed. Curiously, the pavement in front of the MP‚Äôs office on the road is fixed,‚Äù the residents said. Another resident living on adjoining 11th B Main said, ‚ÄúIt was very difficult for us to live here during summer as there was dust everywhere. When politicians want votes, they come to parks and ask us for votes when we are on morning walks. But if we need help, they will never be available.‚Äù C K Ramamurthy, former corporator of the ward, said, ‚ÄúWe had to remove nearly 25 trees on the other side of road but the MLA opposed this and eventually, the work came to a halt. Now there are no funds and residents of the area are suffering.‚Äù MLA Sowmya Reddy, however, said, that she opposed the way in which the project was executed, but never tried to stop the work. ‚ÄúThey had to cut 20-plus trees and I was against it. I even brought in a TenderSURE expert, who said work can happen without having to cut the trees,‚Äù she added. The MLA said she is aware that the work has been pending for a long time now and has written to the chief minister and several others requesting them to complete it at the earliest. ‚ÄúThere has been a shortage of funds for this project. We have little over a km to complete, which will be done once grants are approved. Until then, we can‚Äôt set a fixed date as to when the work will be over,‚Äù a senior BBMP official said. He added, ‚ÄúWe have sought an extra Rs 35 crore to finish asphalting Siddaiah Puranik Road and complete about 1.3km of 11th Main, Jayanagar. We wrote to the government asking for financial aid but it said it doesn‚Äôt have the funds right now. Hence, we approached the BBMP commissioner seeking funds from Palike grants.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tendersure-work-stalled-on-jayanagar-road-for-2-yrs/articleshow/84303652.cms||---

One of the three slain terrorists, identified as Arif Hajam, was involved in the killing of Territorial Army havaldar Manzoor Beigh in June 2019 while he was on leave, IGP (Kashmir Zone) Vijay Kumar confirmed. Based on intelligence inputs, a joint team of the Army, CRPF and J&K Police had launched a cordon-and-search operation in Achabal‚Äôs Kawarigam village. During the search, holed-in terrorists opened fire at the security forces, triggering a gunfight in which the three Lashkar operatives were killed, the IGP said. Meanwhile, all entry and exit points leading to the spot of the encounter were sealed and additional forces were deployed to prevent law and order problems. Some days ago, four Lashkar ultras were killed by security forces in south Kashmir. Among them, two slain in Kulgam were planning a terror strike on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway, IGP Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lashkar-trio-killed-in-jammu-and-kashmir-encounter/articleshow/84303661.cms||M Saleem Pandit

In the video that has gone viral, Shivakumar was purportedly seen getting irritated by the action of the man, a JD(S) worker, who tried to get close to the Congress veteran and put his hand over him. Shivakumar was in Mandya to meet ailing ex- minister G Made Gowda.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Five years on, paperless legislature plan remains on paper||BENGALURU: In the pipeline for over a decade, the proposal to make the state legislature paperless remains a non-starter. Five years ago, Karnataka had revived the project and entered into an agreement with the Centre over the cost-sharing mechanism to implement the national eVidhan project. The Centre and the state had agreed to share the cost (Rs 69 crore) under a 60:40 ratio. But nothing has moved thereafter. ‚ÄúFrom software customisations to a lack of political will, the state government hasn‚Äôt taken any step to implement the system which is currently operating in 16 other states,‚Äô‚Äô secretariat officials said. And it is unlikely to be implemented anytime soon, as the government has asked legislature officials to do a gap analysis between what Karnataka requires and what is being implemented in other states. Chief secretary P Ravi Kumar told STOI directions have been given for the gap analysis and submit a report in a month. ‚ÄúWhile we admit there has been a delay, it has not been easy as well. There have been concerns with regard to customising the software to our needs,‚Äù he said. Software glitchesAccording to government officials, trouble began soon after Karnataka legislature proposed to go paperless 2015-16. It took a leaf out of Himachal Pradesh‚Äôs software implementation called National e-Vidhan Application (NeVa). ‚ÄúHowever, it was found that NeVa could be applied only to unicameral legislatures and till date only those states have implemented the system,‚Äù said an official. While Karnataka still has the option to ditch the software and get its own customised and local application for going paperless, the government appears to be keen on the central government funding. ‚ÄúWhile we‚Äôre exploring options, NeVa software implementation would mean the Centre will provide 60 per cent of the funding,‚Äù said Ravi Kumar. According to officials, the Centre has allocated Rs 250 crore towards implementing the NeVa project nationwide and could provide additional funding if required. But the biggest stumbling block has been the lack of political will. ‚ÄúWhen senior leaders are not keen on embracing technology then there is nothing you can do,‚Äù said a senior BJP MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/5-yrs-on-paperless-legislature-plan-remains-on-paper/articleshow/84303674.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Bengaluru||Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board mulls 5% discount on water bills for bldgs with RWH||BENGALURU: The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) is contemplating taking the reward route to popularise implementation of rainwater harvesting: It may give 5 per cent discount on monthly water bills to properties with RWH facilities. The idea was brainstormed on Saturday during a virtual session titled ‚ÄòCatch the Rain, Bengaluru‚Äô organised by National Water Mission, BWSSB and Biome Environmental. The rebate on water bill, if offered, will be on the lines of the concession being extended by BBMP on property tax paid before the due date, and is expected to encourage more property owners to install RWH systems. National Water Mission director G Asok Kumar mooted the idea and BWSSB chairman N Jayaram responded, stating the proposal will be taken up for discussion at the next board meeting. BWSSB till now provides an appreciation certificate to those implementing RWH. Jayaram said, ‚ÄúBBMP provides 5% rebate on property tax if it is paid early in the financial year and in the same way, we could also see what can be done to promote RWH.‚Äù While Bengaluru‚Äôs dependence on Cauvery river and other sources for water has resulted in losses for BWSSB, Jayaram said RWH can really help the city. Giving an example, he said it takes Rs 95 to supply 1,000 litres of Cauvery water to Bengaluru, while only Rs seven is collected from citizens for the same. He added exponential growth of the city will pose a challenge if RWH is not implemented with citizens‚Äô active participation. According to Jayaram, Cauvery water is brought to the city from 90km away. About 1,440MLD is being supplied to Bengaluru and additional ground water of 600 MLD is drawn. BM Somashekar, chief engineer of the board, said despite the number of rainy days having come down in the city, Bengaluru continues to receive 850mm rainfall annually. But very little is being saved and reused. The board has brought in many awareness programmes to promote RWH, including taking citizens and students to Sir M Visvesvaraya Rain Water Harvesting Theme Park. According to BWSSB, Bengaluru spans about 800sqkm, but BWSSB jurisdiction is 570sqkm as of now, serving a population of 80.5 lakh, while others continue to depend on water tankers, especially those living in apartments. Average per capita consumption of water in Bengaluru is about 65 lakh litres a day. Somashekar said BWSSB has about 8,000 active borewells in the city, but many are drying up during summer. He added they have about 27 RWH models for citizens, which can not only help them reuse water but recharge borewells too. Kumar said training plumbers can make a big difference. Some residents who have implemented RWH shared their experiences, saying how they don‚Äôt have to rely on water tankers and BWSSB. Ashok Mrityunjaya, a resident of Aditi Elite apartment in Bellandur, said the complex did not have a BWSSB connection and was dependent on tankers. But after implementing RWH and digging borewells to recharge water, they have been able to sustain for almost one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bwssb-mulls-5-discount-onwater-bills-for-bldgs-with-rwh/articleshow/84303712.cms||Kiran Parashar
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka still awaits CWC, green clearance for Mekedatu||BENGALURU: After Tamil Nadu turned down Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa‚Äôs offer to hold talks on the Mekedatu project, the state government said it would implement it come what may. The challenge before Karnataka is to get necessary clearances from various ministries and agencies of the central government. The Mekedatu balancing reservoir-cum-drinking water project which seeks to alleviate drinking water needs of Bengaluru and Ramanagara districts besides generating upto 400MW of electricity has been awaiting clearances for four years owing to opposition by neighbouring Tamil Nadu. Karnataka is also awaiting Central Water Commission‚Äôs approval for the detailed project report (DPR) on Mekedatu and environmental nod from the Union ministry of forest, environment and ecology to take up the project. In 2018, the state got nod from the Union water resources ministry for preparation of DPR amid stiff opposition from TN. ‚ÄúThe draft DPR is currently under consideration of CWC. It is a long-drawn process as has to go through several departments. Once we get the approval, the government will start work on implementation,‚Äù said Rakesh Singh, additional chief secretary, water resources department. The government also needs environmental clearance as over 5,050 hectares of forest land, including 3,180 acres of Cauvery wildlife sanctuary, will be submerged due the project. It was originally planned as just a hydel power project three decades ago, but was modified keeping the drinking water needs of Bengaluru city in mind. The project got a boost after the Supreme Court allowed Karnataka to utilise additional 4.8 tmcft of Cauvery water to meet Bengaluru‚Äôs drinking water needs. Another reason for the modification is to hold excess water that flows into the sea so that both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu can utilise it during distress years. According to an estimation, around 200 tmcft of water flows into the sea during excess monsoon rain. But Tamil Nadu claims the project will jeopardise the availability of Cauvery water for TN. Karnataka, however, feel Tamil Nadu‚Äôs apprehensions are uncalled for. Last week, Yediyurappa tried to get his TN counterpart MK Stalin to take part in bilateral talks to find an amicable solution. But Stalin flatly rejected the offer and suggested Karnataka scrap the project. ‚ÄòState needn‚Äôt take TN consent‚Äô‚ÄúKarnataka needn‚Äôt have to take the TN government‚Äôs consent. Since we are utilising water that is allocated to us, the government must go ahead and implement the project. The government must put pressure on the Centre to get necessary approvals as early as possible,‚Äù said Brijesh Kalappa, a Congress functionary and advocate, who was part of the Karnataka legal team on water disputes. Kalappa claimed Yediyurappa‚Äôs decision to write to the TN CM was ill-advised. Now all eyes will be on the all-party meeting in Chennai on Monday convened by Stalin to hold a discussion regarding Mekedatu dam construction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-still-awaits-cwc-green-clearance-for-mekedatu/articleshow/84303715.cms||Anil Gejji
---||Mangaluru||Karnataka: Students head to Nethravati banks for online classes||MANGALURU: Poor internet connectivity has forced nearly 40 students from Chendthimar and Manihalla to head towards the banks of Nethravati river in Bantwal every day, in order to attend online classes. While a few students spend the whole day sitting on the banks of the river to particioate in classes, younger ones are often accompanied by their parents every evening, so that they can download the homework assigned to them by their teachers. Ramya Jagadish, a beautician and the mother of class IV student Dishanth, told STOI: ‚ÄúTwo months ago, my husband who works in a private hospital in Bengaluru, met district minister Kota Shrinivas Poojari and told him about the problems people in these areas are facing due to poor connectivity. There are at least 200 houses that don‚Äôt have proper mobile internet services. To make digital payments or upload a status message, we have to go to the river banks, where mobile internet can be accessed,‚Äô‚Äô she said. ‚ÄúIt has become a routine for parents to accompany their children to the river. With Unlock 3.0, I rush back home at 4.30pm from work to take my son to the banks. There are at least 40 students studying in different classes who come to the spot. Many people had only basic handsets before the pandemic, but because of online classes, they were forced to buy Android phones. Now they struggle to get internet connectivity,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAt a time when online education is the order of the day, the priority of the government must be to solve internet issues. No access to education can hamper a child‚Äôs development. If this is the case in town municipal limits, just imagine the situation in villages,‚Äô‚Äô said Mounesh Vishwakarma, a child rights activist in Puttur. When the issue was brought to the notice of Bantwal BEO Jnanesha M P, he directed officials to look into it immediately. Meanwhile, Bantwal MLA U Rajesh Naik said a district-level meeting was organised recently in the presence of MP, MLAs, deputy commissioner and zilla panchayat CEO to look into the issue of internet connectivity. Efforts are being made to strengthen it, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/students-head-to-nethravati-banks-for-online-classes/articleshow/84303717.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Instead of their usual wake-up time of 6am, convicts and undertrial prisoners were asked to come out of their barracks one hour early. Soon, 100 officials from Central Crime Branch led by joint commissioner of police (crime) Sandeep Patil entered the barracks to carry out a surprise check. Ten police dogs, which were trained to track narcotics and explosives, accompanied them. Some of them ‚Äî Surya, Bhoomi, Drona, Mailu, Krish and Rana ‚Äî spotted ganja hidden behind the shelves, bedrolls and clothes. According to officials, three recent murder cases reported in the city led to the surprise check. ‚ÄúFormer corporator Rekha Khadiresh, financier N Madan and history-sheeter Kareem Ali were killed in a planned manner. We suspect the murders were plotted inside the prison,‚Äù an officer said. Cops seized 26 knives, two mobile phones, four SIM cards, three pen drives and memory cards, 200 grams of ganja, seven smoking pipes and Rs 7,700. Most of the knives were made by inmates using steel tumblers and plates. ‚ÄúThey think they can protect themselves with the tools when attacked by rivals,‚Äù an official said. Another officer said the pen drives had names and contact numbers along with details of bank accounts. ‚ÄúSome of the inmates are part of the land mafia. Sitting inside prison, they call land owners and threaten them,‚Äù an officer said. ‚ÄúIt is an old habit of seasoned criminals to plan illegal activities inside prison. When such conspiracies are hatched, they get themselves arrested in an older case and opt to stay behind bars,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/back-to-back-murders-prompt-police-to-search-jail-barracks/articleshow/84303732.cms||---

Soon, places will be identified and cameras installed in forests where tourism activities are not allowed, said minister for forests Arvind Limbavali. He was speaking to media after holding an official review meeting in Udupi and visiting the Kandla vana (mangrove forest) in Kundapur on Saturday. ‚ÄúWe have permission to commence eco-tourism projects in forest areas. However, there are several restrictions when it comes to development of tourism there. We have developed tourism projects in Bandipur by strictly adhering to rules. However, it is not possible to carry out such projects in core forest areas. Hence, we have directed officials to use technology and develop eco-tourism in such locations. Cameras will be fixed to shoot videos of wildlife, and the footage will be shown to enthusiasts at various centres. Work has already begun at Biligiri Ranganathaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve. Such projects can also be implemented in forest areas of coastal districts,‚Äù he said. The minister said mangrove forests protect the coast from cyclones and tsunamis. ‚ÄúI wanted to see how mangrove forests are grown here. The coast of Kundapur is a breeding area for lady fish. We need to promote eco-tourism here, and the revenue generated should be utilised to develop more mangrove forests in backwaters. We are planning to grow mangrove forests at some locations along the state coastline,‚Äù he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tourists-to-be-shown-wildlife-visuals-from-core-forests-min/articleshow/84303742.cms||---

In his order on Saturday, health and family welfare commissioner KV Thrilok Chandra asked all district administrations to ensure ASHA workers and health assistance monitor regularly in rural areas and fortnightly in urban wards. The department asked officials of Chamarajanagar, Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts in particular to be more vigilant. Monsoon tends to facilitate the spread of Aedes mosquito, which is a vector for Zika virus. Solid waste needs to be effectively disposed of to prevent its breeding. Vector-borne disease control officers of all 31 districts need to step up mid-term strategies, the circular said. Vigil should be stepped up in public places like airports, ports and harbours. The travel history of visitors and even guests at home need to be checked and their samples taken, if needed. They must be sent to National Institute of Virology, Bengaluru, the circular added. The department directed officials to ensure availability of adulticide and larvicide, used for killing mosquitoes, and hold regular inter-sectoral meetings to help in exchange of information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/alert-in-dists-to-check-zika-spread/articleshow/84303995.cms||---

They say engineers should be made accountable for the slow progress. BMRCL records show only 37% of civil work on the section along Bannerghatta Road has been completed. It has five stations ‚Äî Kalena Agrahara, Hulimavu, IIM Bengaluru, JP Nagar 4th Phase and Tavarekere. While Pink Line‚Äôs Kalena Agrahara-Tavarekere corridor is elevated, the section between Dairy Circle and Nagawara is underground. Sanjeev Dyamannavar, a commuter rail activist, said: ‚ÄúThis project was approved in 2014 but tender was floated only in February 2017 as BMRCL couldn‚Äôt source funds on time. No land acquisition problems were seen but still the project is not ready. Action should be initiated against the project manager who is responsible for the delay. BMRCL has failed to monitor the project.‚Äù He said BMRCL should award the fresh tender only to a reputed firm. ‚ÄúThere should be a thorough assessment to ensure ineligible firms don‚Äôt get the contract, to avoid further delays.‚Äù A BMRCL official said: ‚ÄúWe will check credentials and track record of the firms in the technical bids. They will be rejected if they don‚Äôt meet the eligibility criteria. Following this, financial bid will be opened and tender will be awarded to the firm which quotes the least amount. We‚Äôre planning to issue the letter of offer and acceptance (LOA) by August-September.‚Äù Sources said three construction firms, Afcons Infrastructure, ITD Cementation India Ltd and GR Infra Projects Ltd (GRIL), are in the race for the unfinished section on Bannerghatta Road. In January 2021, BMRCL terminated the contract of Simplex Infrastructures Limited over delayed execution of work on the 7.5-km section between Kalena Agrahara (Gottigere) and Tavarekere (Swagath Road Cross). In March 2021, a fresh tender was floated.

---||India||After many false starts, IMD says monsoon set to hit Delhi today||NEW DELHI: Reeling under scorching heat and high humidity, Delhi-NCR residents may finally get some rain relief. The Met department says the long-delayed monsoon is likely to hit the region on Sunday, bringing some showers in its wake that would lower temperatures over the next few days. However, Delhiites will be wary. So far, the monsoon has repeatedly failed to keep its ‚Äî rather, the India Meteorological Department‚Äôs ‚Äî dates with the capital. The IMD had initially forecast the monsoon‚Äôs arrival around mid-June, which would have made it one of the earliest onsets over Delhi. The next likely onset window, July first week, too went by with no signs of the rain-bearing system. If the monsoon finally hits the city on Sunday, it would be the most delayed advent in 19 years. Only light rain likely for next 4 daysDelhi had last seen a more delayed monsoon onset in 2002, when it reached the city on July 19. On Saturday, the Met department said Delhi is expected to see the onset of the southwest monsoon by Sunday, forecasting its progress over Delhi, west Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan in the next 24 hours. While the IMD had initially forecast light rains over Delhi on Saturday and moderate showers from Sunday onwards, it said the intensity of the expected rain had reduced, with only light rainfall likely from Sunday until Wednesday. ‚ÄúLower level easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal have further extended northwestward, reaching up to Delhi, Haryana and east Rajasthan, as on today,‚Äù the IMD said on Saturday in its daily monsoon bulletin, adding that conditions were favourable for ‚Äúfurther advancement of the southwest monsoon over Delhi, remaining parts of West Uttar Pradesh, some more parts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan during the next 24 hours‚Äù. ‚ÄúConditions are also becoming favourable for further advancement of the southwest monsoon over the remaining parts of the country, during the subsequent 48 hours,‚Äù it added. R K Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said some parts of the city may receive isolated spells of very light rain on Saturday night, however, there were greater chances of rain on Sunday, with rain activity expected in the afternoon and evening. ‚ÄúIt is expected to progress into Delhi in the next 24 hours and the onset will be declared based on when Delhi gets covered completely,‚Äù said Jenamani. Since July 1, the IMD had been forecasting that monsoon was likely to hit Delhi by July 10. It‚Äôs initial forecast of an early onset (mid-June) was thwarted by the monsoon weakening literally at the doorstep of Delhi-NCR. The normal date for onset of the monsoon in Delhi is June 27. Last year, it hit the city two days early, on June 25. The capital recorded a maximum temperature of 39.8 degrees Celsius on Saturday at Safdarjung, Delhi‚Äôs base station. This was four degrees above normal. Humidity levels too remained high, oscillating between 46% and 77%. Najafgarh was the warmest location in Delhi, with the maximum at 40.7 degrees Celsius, IMD data showed. With monsoon playing hooky and scalding westerly winds blowing for several days, the city has had six 40-degree-plus days in July already. Last year, July saw just one such day while 2019 and 2018 had two each. However, with the monsoon predicted to finally arrive, the Met office said Sunday‚Äôs maximum is likely to drop to 35 degrees C, which could further dip to 32 degrees C by Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-many-false-starts-imd-says-monsoon-set-to-hit-delhi-today/articleshow/84305626.cms||---

The decision is in line with the BJP-led government‚Äôs repeated assertions that the state‚Äôs demography and indigenous cultures need protection from the onslaught of immigrants. CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said people of ‚Äúall indigenous faiths‚Äù would reap the benefits of the schemes that will be rolled out by the new department. ‚ÄúOur tribal people have their own language and culture. They have their own faiths. But financial assistance from successive governments to protect their traditions had been lacking so far,‚Äù he told reporters. ‚ÄúSince they don‚Äôt have the resources or the ability to mobilise donations to celebrate and preserve their traditions, the government has decided to preserve and protect their traditions with necessary support.‚Äù The communities identified by the government for such schemes include the Bodos, tea tribes, Morans, Mottocks, Rabhas and Mishings. ‚ÄúOur cabinet has requested the finance minister to make a substantial budget allocation for the new department since it is a noble initiative,‚Äù the CM said. In another major decision on administrative and financial reforms, Sarma said the cabinet had decided that departmental committees could henceforth approve schemes with allocations up to Rs 2 crore. This will eliminate red tape and help officials take faster decisions on new projects, he said. Departmental committees will be headed by the commissioner of the department concerned. For projects worth Rs 2-5 crore, a meeting of the standing finance committee, chaired by the chief secretary, will be held every Friday. Projects in the Rs 5-100 crore band will go through a special standing finance committee headed by the finance minister. Departmental commissioners will be the member secretaries. Meetings of this committee will be held every Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/in-assam-a-new-department-of-indigenous-faith-and-culture/articleshow/84306182.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Among the issues that were discussed were those pertaining to holding of the kanwar yatra as well as the Char Dham yatra. A cloud of uncertainty currently hangs over the conduct of the two yatras, which are major annual pilgrimages that are identified with Uttarakhand. Sources close to the CM confirmed that he held discussions with Modi and Shah over the yatras. Later, Dhami said that a decision would be taken on the kanwar yatra after talking to the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh since most of the kanwarias come from these states. The UP government has already announced that it will allow the kanwar yatra from July 25 . The yatra had been cancelled by the Tirath Singh Rawat-led government in Uttarakhand late last month after a review of the Covid-19 situation indicated it would not be prudent to allow the pilgrimage. But after Dhami took charge as CM last week, UP CM Yogi Adityanath spoke to him regarding the possibility of allowing kanwarias to Haridwar to collect water from the Ganga. Dhami had thereafter called a meeting of senior officials and directed them to coordinate with neighbouring states and discuss the logistics. This had led to speculations that the government is reconsidering its decision to cancel the yatra. Earlier kanwar yatras have seen massive crowds of anything from 3 crore to 5 crore people converging at Haridwar. Incidentally, the Char Dham yatra has also been stayed by the Uttarakhand high court. The bench had said that the decision to allow local residents to visit Char Dham shrines amid the threat of a third wave and the new Delta-plus variant of the coronavirus would be akin to ‚Äúinviting a calamity‚Äù. The state government has challenged the stay in the Supreme Court.

The revival plan, submitted by its new owners Kalrock-Jalan, proposes a payment of about Rs 23,000 to each employee. Under the resolution plan, which was cleared recently by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), the payment would be made only if 95% of Jet employees give their acceptance to the plan within the next three months. But with no word in the NCLT order even on statutory dues like gratuity and with no clarity on their pending dues, Jet Airways employees have found themselves in a fix. ‚ÄúJet has asked employees to cast a vote, either a yes or no, to the plan cleared by NCLT. But the plan hardly offers about 0.5% of the total sum owed to each employee. It is as good as zero,‚Äù said Kiran Pawaskar, president, All India Jet Airways Officers and Staff Association. ‚ÄúIf the issue isn‚Äôt resolved, we will challenge this in the court,‚Äù he told TOI. The association sent a letter recently to the new civil aviation minister, labour minister and regional labour commissioner. ‚ÄúOn preliminary perusal of the resolution plan we found no reference to the claims of the employees. A very paltry amount has been proposed as a resolution in the insolvency and bankruptcy process. The company over its 26 years of existence has a large work force and many of them have worked for long parts of their lives,‚Äù it said. Jet Airways owes an undisputed sum of Rs 15,400 crore to its creditors, out of which Rs 1,254 crore is owed to its workers and employees in the form of unpaid salaries, gratuity etc. A Jet staffer said, ‚ÄúJet owes each commander about Rs 85 lakh and about Rs 3 lakh to the lowest paid employee. The quantum that the workers stand to lose under the resolution plan is shocking.‚Äù The cash payment proposed by Kalrock-Jalan for each worker is a token sum of Rs 11,000 and then Rs 5,100 towards medical reimbursements for workmen‚Äôs parents, Rs 6,200 as reimbursement for workmen‚Äôs children and a one-time mobile recharge of Rs 500. Amit Kelkar of Jet Aircraft Maintenance Engineers Welfare Association has been with Jet for 24 years. ‚ÄúWe and our team of lawyers are studying the NCLT order and other related documents in detail and shall take a decision after carefully considering all aspects,‚Äù he said. Jet Airways had suspended its flights in April 2019. In October last year, Jet Airways committee of creditors approved the revival plan submitted by the Kalrock-Jalan consortium. It proposed to invest Rs 600 crore to repay creditors to acquire about 90% stake in the carrier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/jet-owes-staffers-up-to-rs-85-lakh-plans-to-pay-rs-23000/articleshow/84306941.cms||Manju V
---||India||A retired SC judge can get paid more in 2 hours than a serving one in a month||NEW DELHI: If there is a travesty about the principle of equal work, equal pay, one need not turn to the urban-hinterland disparity as a comparison of compensation paid to a Supreme Court judge for hearing and deciding a case and to a senior advocate for arguing it brings out the wide chasm. An SC judge gets a salary of Rs 2.5 lakh a month, which works out to approximately Rs 8,333 per day, during which he hears arguments from lawyers on an average in 40 cases. This translates to Rs 208 per case, be it a simple appeal, a PIL on Covid issues, or one involving intricate questions of law. In contrast, a newly designated senior advocate commands a price of Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh for arguing a case. The services of a seasoned advocate like A M Singhvi, Kapil Sibal, Mukul Rohatgi or Harish Salve may find the litigant's bank balance lighter by Rs 10 lakh-20 lakh per hearing. So an SC judge, who hears and decides a case, gets Rs 208 per day per case while seasoned senior advocates, who cannot guarantee a result in a case, are paid in lakhs of rupees per day per case. Well, none of the senior advocates argue in 40 cases a day, for which an SC judge prepares every evening to be ready to listen to the legal arguments the next day. This is the reason why many SC judges look forward to their retirement, which allows them to offer legal expertise as arbitrators, or, for that matter, provide valued opinion to corporations and multinationals on legal issues in their operations in India, or in disputes arising from contracts, agreements and MoUs. A retired SC judge earns between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 5 lakh for a two-hour sitting as an arbitrator and there are some who do three sittings every day to match the earnings of a reasonably successful senior advocate. A retired Chief Justice of India commands a little more than a retired SC judge while performing the duty of an arbitrator. In rendering an opinion, a retired SC judge gets between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh while each opinion of a retired CJI fetches her/him Rs 10-20 lakh. A retired CJI confided to TOI: "I do three to four opinions a month and earn between Rs 30-50 lakh, unthinkable money for a sitting judge. I indulge in a lot of charity. And yet, I am left with an amount which is more than the provident fund money I got on retirement after rendering services for more than two decades as a judge of constitutional courts." The only difference between a senior advocate and an SC judge, in terms of compensation, is the sprawling Lutyens‚Äô Zone bungalow and free services of assistants that s/he is entitled to. Some of the bungalows allotted to SC judges are built on two acres of land. A future CJI, in a candid conversation, said, "The benefits and perquisites given to judges are far better than those provided in the 1980s. There was no individual vehicle given to SC judges then. But now the facilities are comparable to those availed by such judges of other countries. The salary is low but the facilities make up for it."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/a-retired-sc-judge-can-get-paid-more-in-2-hours-than-a-serving-one-in-a-month/articleshow/84307245.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

In spite of Ladakh‚Äôs low population, this is no mean feat in view of the region‚Äôs challenging terrain, extreme weather and isolated centres of population ‚Äî many of which are difficult to access. According to official data, a total of 89,404 people from all eligible age groups, including 18-44 years, have been administered the first dose of Covid vaccine. The second dose has been administered to 60,936 people. This was done in less than three months of starting the third phase of vaccination, covering the 18-44 age group. A total of 6,821 Nepalese citizens living in the UT were among those vaccinated. ‚ÄúWe gave priority to hotel workers, most of whom are from outside Ladakh, and taxi/public transport drivers as they are in the front-line of the tourism industry. Labourers and handymen come in from other states during summer, so they were also treated on priority,‚Äù a senior district official told TOI. A wide network of functioning primary health centres and health workers experienced in mass vaccination programmes such as against polio helped pace up the vaccination. ‚ÄúCovid vaccination was nothing new for our grassroots health workers experienced in programmes such as for polio. It was just another programme to be implemented,‚Äù the official said requesting anonymity. The official said the administration actually started vaccinating the 18-44 year age group before it was formally sanctioned. ‚ÄúWe ended up with surplus vaccines. So instead of wasting them, we started vaccinating once the government decided in principle to vaccinate this age group.‚Äù He said the Centre also ensured steady and ‚Äúmore than adequate‚Äù supply of vaccine ‚Äúwhich boosted the confidence of health workers and paced up the speed of vaccination in spite of the difficulties‚Äù.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ladakh-first-union-territory-to-achieve-100-first-dose-coverage/articleshow/84307548.cms||Sanjay Dutta

One of the relatives allegedly urinated in their house and attacked the woman, a Dalit, with axes. A case has been filed under the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act besides sections of IPC, including attempt to murder. Shivavva Basappa Talawar, 48, said she belongs to Valmiki community (which falls in ST category) and married Iranagouda Basanagouda Kulkarni, 55, belonging to an upper caste, about 28 years ago. ‚ÄúBasanagouda Sanganagouda Kulkarni, kin of my husband, came at our house on Thursday and urinated there. When I objected, he said I belong to a lower caste so he can urinate anywhere. He uttered obscene words at me. As my husband and son Hanumantagouda tried to prevent him, he and four others came together and attacked us with weapons,‚Äù the complaint said. She added, ‚ÄúThey tried to pull my sari and set our house on fire.‚Äù Hanumantagouda, 26, said, ‚ÄúThough my parents married a long time ago, our relative have been harassing us through the years. They are now forcing us to give up 5 acres of ancestral land which my father has got. They abuse my mother repeatedly. We were admitted to the government hospital on Thursday and discharged on Friday. We filed a complaint in the evening.‚Äù An FIR has been filed against Basanagouda Kulkarni and four others. Police said the complainant, her husband and son suffered minor injuries. ‚ÄúWe have learned that the complainant was planning to sell the agricultural land allotted to her husband by his elders,‚Äù Ron PSI Vinod Pujari said. Police, however, added that the accused wanted Kulkarni to sell the land to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dalit-couple-attacked-by-kin/articleshow/84307632.cms||---

Overall, the tech capital has recorded the highest number of deaths in the state, but the situation has improved in recent weeks. There is now a greater focus on other regions. A preliminary review of data by the department revealed that most deaths in the districts outside Bengaluru happened because of delays in identifying patients with worsening health. Senior officials said that tracking and testing strategies would be strengthened in these districts. So far this month, the state has reported 739 deaths ‚Äî 102 in Bengaluru and 637 in other parts. Dakshina Kannada, which has a smaller population than Bengaluru, accounts for 113, the highest. Health officials, who have been analysing state-wide infection patterns, said that 40 to 50 per cent of the deaths in some districts were linked to late hospitalisations. Lack of awareness among people and clinics‚Äô failure to refer symptomatic people to hospitals are also major reasons. ‚ÄúSome people view it (Covid) as flu or something. They don‚Äôt get tested on time. They panic and seek medical attention only when their symptoms become severe and they develop breathlessness. Physicians find it very difficult to treat cases turning up so late,‚Äù said health and family welfare commissioner KV Thrilok Chandra. He added: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve found that people go for local treatment. Anyone with symptoms should be treated as a suspected case. We‚Äôve been sending mobile teams and asking doctors to upload the results. Some clinics are not following protocol. The government is cracking down in such instances.‚Äù In a heartening sign, some districts are reporting a few or zero deaths. Yadgir has not seen fatalities in the past 25 days. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve a population of 14.3 lakh, and 12 lakh people live in rural areas. About 1,000 ASHA workers conduct door-to-door checks there. The idea is to create awareness, the strategy we used for polio vaccination,‚Äù said Yadgir district health officer Indumati Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-moves-to-check-covid-toll-outside-bluru/articleshow/84307633.cms||---

---||India||Record 354kg heroin worth Rs 2,500 crore seized by Delhi cops||NEW DELHI: In the biggest drug bust in its history, Delhi Police's special cell has seized 354kg of grade A heroin worth a staggering Rs 2,500 crore in the international market. Four key members of a cartel, including a chemical expert who turned crude powder into pure heroin, have been arrested. The network is spread across several countries with kingpins based in Canada, Portugal and Afghanistan and multiple modules are active in India to carry out narco-terrorism activities in the country, the cops said. The cartel, investigations have revealed, was importing under the cover of legitimate goods like talc stone, gypsum powder and basil seeds, packed in material like gunny bags, cartons etc. It was then transported in containers to Iran‚Äôs Chabahar port. "From there, the consignments containing the contraband were shipped to Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, Mumbai. Thereafter, the material was separated from the legitimate consignments and sent to makeshift factories," DCP (special cell) Pramod Kushwaha told TOI. Special chemical experts from Afghanistan were then roped in to process the contraband and turn it into pure and saleable heroin. One such processor, Hazrat Ali from Kandahar, is among those arrested. His associate, Rizwan Kashmiri from Anantnag, has been arrested as well apart from two members of the Punjab wing of this cartel. About 100kg of the chemical used to turn crude contraband into pure heroin has also been seized. The operation was conducted by ACPs Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan from the New Delhi range of the cell. The team had busted a similar module in 2019. Developing leads which had stemmed from that operation, ACP Negi learned that a suspect named Rizwan was dealing in drugs across Delhi and Madhya Pradesh. On July 5, specific information was received about Rizwan's movements in Ghitorni area of south Delhi. Inspector Vinod Badola, SI Sundar Gautam and others laid a trap and arrested the suspect with 1kg of heroin. However, this turned out to be just the tip of the iceberg. During interrogation, Kashmiri allegedly revealed that he worked under the command of an Afghan national, Isha Khan, who recently left India and is now based in Afghanistan. Khan had directed Kashmiri to contact two men, Gurpreet Singh and Gurjot Singh, both residents of Punjab, who were operating a drug racket from NSG Vihar Coop Housing Society in Sector 65, Faridabad. A raid was conducted and both were apprehended. The two led the cops to two cars ‚Äî Verna and Amaze ‚Äî having 166kg and 115kg of heroin, respectively. Further, 70kg of the substance was seized from the bed box of their flat, leaving the cops stunned over the scale of recovery. The two men have claimed that they work for a Portugal-based handler named Navpreet Singh. Gurpreet had met him when the two were lodged in Kapurthala jail in a drugs case. Navpreet works in coordination with his counterparts in Afghanistan, Iran and Canada. Meanwhile, based on Rizwan's disclosure, the cops arrested Hazrat Ali and seized chemicals and heroin from him as well. Ali and others were part of the chemical module of this syndicate and were operating from makeshift factories in different states, the biggest of them being in Shivpuri, Madhya Pradesh, at present. "The locals, with the help of Afghan experts, process the heroin and the various chemicals required for this are procured by the network members from various chemical shops located in MP and Delhi. After preparation, the heroin is delivered to Punjab, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan J&K and various other parts of India using different supply chains," DCP Kushwaha said. The arrested people are parts of different components of this network. This module is suspected to be part of a bigger network. Police commissioner Balaji Srivastava is learned to have formed a special team to unearth the entire nexus. Efforts are on to track the source based in Afghanistan in coordination with intelligence agencies apart from tracing conduits active at the Mumbai port and others parts of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/record-354kg-heroin-worth-rs-2500-crore-seized-by-delhi-cops/articleshow/84307678.cms||Raj Sekhar

India will take over the presidentship of the UNSC in August. An official readout said Modi ‚Äúwelcomed the fact that both countries share a similar vision of an open, inclusive, peaceful and rules-based Indian Ocean Region, and hence the India-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership can contribute to promote regional stability, prosperity and development‚Äù. Interestingly, the official statement did not mention the ‚ÄúSouth China Sea‚Äù. Vietnam refers to it as the ‚ÄúEast Sea‚Äù. ‚ÄúSpoke on phone with H.E. Pham Minh Chinh, Prime Minister of Vietnam. Reviewed all aspects of our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, reiterated our shared vision for Indo-Pacific, and agreed to maintain close cooperation including in the UNSC,‚Äù Modi tweeted. This was Modi‚Äôs first conversation with Pham. The MEA statement quoted him as thanking Vietnam for its support during the second wave of Covid. The two leaders decided to mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two nations in 2022 in a ‚Äúbefitting manner through various commemorative activities‚Äù. Earlier this week, Vietnam protested yet again against Chinese move to send a ‚Äòresearch vessel‚Äô to Paracel islands over which Vietnam claims sovereignty.

S Jaishankar on first trip to Georgia after visiting Russia||NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday invited Georgian companies to invest in India, as he called on the country‚Äôs top leadership, including PM Irakli Garibashvili, during his first visit to the country, which is also seen as a rare message to India‚Äôs old partner, Russia. Jaishankar, who landed in Tbilisi after a three-day visit to Moscow, chose a particularly emotional moment for Georgia and a possibly breakthrough moment for bilateral ties. He handed over a relic of the St. Queen Ketevan to the government at a ceremony. But the political signalling of the visit is not to be ignored either, given the hostile relations between Georgia and Russia. In April, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, for the first time ever, visited Pakistan after India, introducing a hyphenation to the bilateral relationship that did not go down well in New Delhi. After a 26-year hunt, the Archaeological Survey of India had in 2016 identified the remains of Queen Ketevan in a destroyed church in Goa. An official statement said the Queen‚Äôs remains were found in 2005 at the ‚ÄúSt. Augustine Convent in Old Goa, India... They are believed to have been brought to Goa in 1627 and interred in St. Augustine Complex‚Äù. Georgia has been asking for the relic to be permanently housed there. After a tour in 2017-2018, India acceded to Georgia‚Äôs persistent request to give a part of the relic. India does not yet have a mission in Tbilisi which is serviced by India‚Äôs mission in Yerevan, Armenia. Therefore, Jaishankar‚Äôs two-day visit to the country, situated at the intersection of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, is even more significant. Jaishankar indicated India was willing to do more in terms of investment in Georgia, which ranks highly in the ease of doing business index. Georgia has also applied for the EU membership, which, if accepted would give India another gateway to Europe, and a foothold in the Caucasus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/signal-to-moscow-s-jaishankar-on-first-trip-to-georgia-after-visiting-russia/articleshow/84307921.cms||Indrani Bagchi

APCO has decided to train weavers in using organic dyes and methods. APCO will procure new organic dyes manufactured by using base material from pomegranate, orange, sweet orange fruits, neem, ‚Äòharitaki‚Äô (Karakkaya) and sandalwood. ‚ÄúWe have decided to switch to the new mode to grab a decent share in the global market as organic clothes are a big hit on the global platform and our weavers are capable of producing good quality stock,‚Äù APCO chairman Chillapalli Venkata Naga Mohan Rao told STOI. He said that they would also utilise yarn produced without using any chemicals to make organic varieties. Chillapalli said that they have already identified a few expert master weavers to provide training. The chairman said they would provide training to at least 100 handloom weavers from each district to produce organic clothes. ‚ÄúAPCO will assure weavers to pick up the entire stock produced with organic dyes,‚Äù said Chillapalli. A delegation of APCO including its chairman Chillapalli Mohan Rao and managing director Ambedkar will meet top executives of the Handloom Exports Council in Chennai on July 14 to devise new strategies to shore up exports of handloom clothes from AP. Meanwhile, APCO is readying plans to transform handloom cooperative societies in the state to compete in the private market to improve the livelihoods of weavers. APCO has already tied up with online marketplaces and is getting an increasing number of orders from retail customers. APCO is opening new branded stores in Guntur, Ongole, Tirupati and Kadapa shortly. The organisation has also decided to renovate at least 20 stores across the state to attract the new market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/apco-to-train-weavers-eyes-global-mkt-share/articleshow/84301630.cms||Samdani MN

IG (prohibition) Amrit Raj has also asked Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma to take necessary steps for initiating departmental proceedings against the cop. Alam had raided some liquor parties under the jurisdiction of Buddha Colony police station recently only to show it to the authorities concerned that he was serious in implementing prohibition in his area. A senior officer of state police headquarters said the prohibition wing had started an inquiry against Alam after a crackdown on an organised racket engaged in home delivery of liquor in Digha on June 12 this year. ‚ÄúFive people were arrested with 326 litres of Indian-made foreign liquor and two SUVs in which liquor was being transported. After this crackdown, the prohibition wing started an internal investigation and found Alam in constant touch with liquor mafias. Multiple telephonic conversation interceptions helped investigating officers to come to the conclusion that Alam was in touch with liquor smugglers,‚Äù a senior prohibition wing officer said. SSP Sharma said Alam was suspended by the prohibition wing after the DGP‚Äôs approval. ‚ÄúAlam has been attached to Patna Police Lines for the time being,‚Äù he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sho-suspended-for-links-with-liquor-smugglers/articleshow/84303978.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Second wave deals blow to tourism department‚Äôs recovery hopes||VIJAYAWADA: Continuing last year‚Äôs trend, the state tourism department has seen an alarming decline in its revenue owing to the 50-day curfew across the state. According to tourism officials, there has been a revenue loss of around Rs 160 crore for the department alone which is an over 100% increase compared to the figure during the first wave last year which was only Rs 60 crore. Tourism footfall‚Äîboth domestic and foreign included‚Äîsaw an over 700% decrease in Andhra Pradesh compared to 2019. The tourism industry in general, which generates 10% of the state‚Äôs GDP, faced the maximum brunt of the pandemic. According to the state Tours and Travel Association of Andhra (TTAA), the industry has been witnessing a Rs 25 crore loss every month for the last 17 months. Till date, around Rs 430 crore has been lost. According to Hotels and Restaurants Association of Andhra Pradesh (HRAAP), around 25% of hotels have permanently shut their business since the lockdown during the first wave. Another 10% are the verge of shutting down as their hopes of relaunching business in the current financial year has seen abysmal results. While hotels in cities have been seeing reasonable businesses, those associated with tour operators have been getting a bare minimum order of 25%. Many hotels that had hoped to bank on raising revenue by turning their establishment into Covid Care Centre (CCCs) had to discard their plans after the fire mishap at Swarna Palace in Vijayawada that claimed 10 lives on August 9, 2020. Around 50% of travel agencies have also shut shop. Nearly 6,000 employees in the tourism industry are hoping for a slim chance of reviving the sector. Officials hope that with the relaunch of boating services and renovating the state hotel sector under the PPP mode, normalcy will return.

A decade later, when the local police sought help from the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to provide any and every available detail on Jadav to help trace him, the Aadhaar authority cited the right to privacy of the person--missing in this case. In March this year, the Gujarat HC directed Banaskantha police to launch an investigation to trace Jadav and ordered UIDAI to cooperate with the police to trace Jadav through Aadhaar card, if it was issued at all to him. Reluctant to share Aadhaar information, if it has any, on missing Jadav, the UIDAI authorities informed the Gujarat high court that the HC can order it to furnish information only after hearing the authority and the person whose information is being sought for. Ironically, in this case, it is a missing person! The insistence on part of the Aadhaar authority on following the law perplexed the HC which directed UIDAI on Wednesday to cooperate with the police in its investigation into the disappearance of Jadav after 10 years following a habeas corpus petition filed by Jadav‚Äôs father, Nagjibhai. Jadav had disappeared from Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Kumar Chhatralay in Devas village in Banaskantha. His father frantically inquired with the schools and hostel authorities and pursued the matter with high-ups in the government. When no trace of his son was found, he approached the high court through advocate Nayanavati Jethva. Following the HC order, the Deesa police wrote to UIDAI seeking information about Jadav, if it has any. In reply, the authority said that it would be difficult to identify a person merely on the basis of his birth date and name and without Aadhaar number. The authority later reiterated this in its affidavit filed in the high court and asserted that it would not be feasible to trace him on the basis of cursory details. It also cited various provisions of laws and court orders by which the right to privacy restricts disclosure of details pertaining to an Aadhaar card holder. The Aadhaar authority further submitted that the court can order it to furnish information about an Aadhaar card holder only after hearing UIDAI and the person concerned. It cited provisions of section 33(1) of UIDAI Act. ‚ÄúIt is pertinent to mention that since Mr. Jigar Kumar Nagji Bhai Jadav has now attained majority (as per the information provided by state police authorities), he is also required to be heard by the Court along with the authority in view of the aforesaid Section 33 (1) of the said Act (as amended), in case if he has enrolled himself for an Aadhaar number and subsequently allotted the same by the Authority,‚Äù the affidavit reads. Meanwhile, the Banaskantha police submitted its report on the probe during the hearing. The HC has posted the matter for further hearing on July 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/aadhaars-catch-22-to-get-missing-mans-info-trace-him/articleshow/84304671.cms||Saeed Khan

The DSP had gone to Koderma for a picnic and took the service pistol with him. Nikhil‚Äôs father Rishidev Singh is also a Bihar Police sub-inspector posted in Gaya. The incident occurred when Ashutosh and his friends were clicking selfies near the dam. Two of the arrested friends of Ashutosh were identified as Saurav Kumar and Suraj Kumar, both residents of 70-Feet Road in Patna. Nikhil was also a resident of the same locality. Ashutosh, on the other hand, hails from Rohtas in Bihar. The DSP on probation was first posted at Simri police station in Buxar as SHO for training. After remaining there for around three months, he was transferred to the Bramhapur circle inspector office on July 4 for further training. Neither Bihar DGP S K Singhal nor Buxar SP Neeraj Kumar Singh responded to calls made by TOI to clarify whether the DSP had proceeded on a leave after seeking permission or was on an official assignment for which he was carrying his service pistol. A senior Buxar police officer said the DSP had proceeded on a two-day leave. ‚ÄúBefore proceeding on leave, we have to submit our service weapons in armoury. As per rules, the state police headquarters will order an inquiry into the matter,‚Äù he added. Bramhapur circle inspector Vimal Das, in whose office the DSP was undergoing training, said, ‚ÄúOnly the SP can say whether the DSP was on leave or not.‚Äù The SP, however, disconnected TOI‚Äôs call.

Saifai Block, which was constituted in 1994, always had a pramukh who was a member or closely associated with the Yadav clan. The 55 BDC members from the Saifai panchayat elect a block chief and out of those 55 all are often BDC members of the Samajwadi Party. For the first time, Ranveer Singh, son of Mulayam‚Äôs eldest brother Ratan Singh, was elected as the head of Saifai block. Ranveer was elected as the block head of Saifai in 2000 again. However, after his sudden demise in 2002, the responsibility of the block head of Saifai in 2003 was given to Dharmendra Yadav, son of Mulayam‚Äôs younger brother Abhayram Yadav. Dharmendra vacated the seat a year later when he was elected as MP from Mainpuri in the 2004 Lok Sabha by-elections as Mulayam vacated the seat after becoming the chief minister in 2003.  Thereafter, Mulayam‚Äôs close confidante Nathu Singh‚Äôs nephew Arvind Yadav remained as the block head till the responsibility was passed on to Ranvir‚Äôs son and Mulayam‚Äôs grandson Tej Pratap who became the block pramukh in 2011. He, however, vacated the seat in 2014 after he was elected from the Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat. Thereafter, Tej Pratap‚Äôs mother Mridula Yadav took over at the new pramukh of Saifai block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/msy-bahu-lalus-samdhin-elected-block-head-unopposed/articleshow/84303553.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

With the Copa final kicking off at 5.30 am on Sunday ‚Äî the match will run at least till 7am ‚Äî and the Euro final slated for a 12.30am start the next morning, catching a wink will be as big a challenge for fans as the Italian defense may pose to Kane and company or Messi‚Äôs darting runs to the Brazilian defenders. Sleep deprivation, doctors warn, could make you weary, irritable and erratic. So, try and get some sleep between the matches, they say, making sure not to sleep long enough to disturb the normal sleeping pattern. ‚ÄúFirst, don‚Äôt drive, swim or indulge in any heavy physical activity on Monday morning. Remember, if you watch both matches, you will be sleeping less on two consecutive nights, which is bound to take a toll on your system,‚Äù said Apollo Gleneagles Hospital critical care specialist Suresh Ramasubban, who heads the hospital‚Äôs sleep clinic. Losing a few hours of sleep can be easily made up without falling ill, though, he said. ‚ÄúAfter the morning match, have your breakfast and stick to your normal work schedule. If you are working from home, don‚Äôt hit the bed immediately. Rather, take a 45-minute power nap in the afternoon and return to work. You will overcome the sleepiness and be fresh enough to stay up late for the Euro final,‚Äù said Ramasubban. After a fortnight of watching Euro matches live till late at night followed by office in the morning, Golf Green resident Avik Ghosh says he can feel fatigue taking its toll. ‚ÄúThese days, it feels as though I am in a stupor. Once the tournament is over, it will be sad but I will also be relieved and catch up on sleep,‚Äù the corporate executive said. It may take a few days to get back to the normal sleep routine, said consultant Arindam Biswas. ‚ÄúThis is true for those who have been staying up late for the last several nights. On Sunday, take short naps during the day and in case you feel unwell, skip work the next day,‚Äù said Biswas. Sudip Naha of Swiss Park has perfected the art of power naps between matches. ‚ÄúSince I have my own business, I can adjust my time. I am watching the matches but utilizing the afternoon to compensate for the sleep deprivation at night,‚Äù said Naha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sleepless-in-kolkata-from-dawn-to-late-night-fans-stare-at-22-hr-day-to-watch-soccer-magic/articleshow/84303254.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Justice G Chandrasekharan observed that due to the prevailing pandemic, people are not in a position to move, interact and do their regular business freely for the past 16 months. ‚ÄúThe situation is that students are being taught only through online mode. Business transactions and official meetings are being held through video conferencing,‚Äù he said adding that even court proceedings are conducted through video conferencing. Hence, the installation of mobile phone towers throughout the country is one of the necessary steps to be taken for the effective and robust communication network. The court made these observations while allowing a batch of petitions filed by ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited, a private telecom company based at Chennai, seeking police protection to install mobile phone towers at various places in southern districts. The company had sought the direction as local residents were opposing the installation of mobile phone towers and their applications seeking permission for erecting the towers were kept pending by district collectors. The judge directed the authorities to pass appropriate orders on these applications. Based on the outcome of the applications, the petitioner is at liberty to make proper representation to the police for protection, if required. If such representation was made to the concerned police, it shall be considered on merits to give proper police protection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madras-hc-bats-for-more-cellphone-towers/articleshow/84328124.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Inaugurating a webinar on ‚ÄòProgress of Bihar in SDG with Special Reference to Good Health and Well-being‚Äô organized by PU‚Äôs Population Research Centre (PRC) on the eve of World Population Day, Chaudhary observed that Bihar had taken up the agenda of SDG in the right earnest.

Today it stands at about 7.7 billion and is expected to grow to around 8.5 billion in 2030.‚Äù PRC‚Äôs joint director, Dilip Kumar, pointed out that although Bihar had witnessed some decline in the infant mortality rate and the maternal mortality ratio during the last few years, its figures were still higher than the national average. ‚ÄúPublic health facilities in the state are far from satisfactory. Anaemia and malnutrition are major challenges that lead to maternal and child mortality. Around 43% of the children below the age of 5 years are stunted and 7 out of 10 children are anaemic in Bihar,‚Äù Kumar claimed. At the outset, PRC‚Äôs director, B K Pandey, welcomed the participants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/public-health-facilities-in-bihar-far-from-satisfactory/articleshow/84303393.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Volunteers of Ganga Samagra to plant ‚Äòpanchkol‚Äô saplings along Ganga||Prayagraj: Volunteers of Ganga Samagra, an organisation associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) have decided to develop areas within five kilometres of the radius of Ganga, as forest land. For the purpose, villagers will be made aware to protect the environment and intensive plantation drive will be carried out. Saplings of ‚Äòpanchkol‚Äô, that is, five trees including Peepal, Pakkad, Banyan, Bel and Babul, will be planted. The drive will be carried out in rural pockets of both trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna regions of the district. Co-convener of Ganga Samagra Kashi province, Rakesh Mishra, while detailing on the ambitious plan, said, ‚ÄúPanchkol, that is, Banyan, Peepal, Pakad, Bel and indigenous Babul (acacia plant) trees have medicinal properties as they are able to exhale large amounts of oxygen. These trees also hold a special place in our Sanatan traditions and texts. So, we decided to plant saplings of these trees along the 5-km radius of Ganga and also in the ponds of the villages‚Äù. ‚ÄúCurrently, the number of these trees have reduced to a great extent owing to many reasons which include the materialistic way of life of people. Now, the organisation has come up with an action plan to plant and take care of these five types of trees,‚Äù added Mishra. ‚ÄúThe cooperation of the local people is also required for this initiative. To protect the plants, tree guards are being procured from the residents of the area. Individuals have been given the responsibility of taking care of the planted saplings. Each sapling is named after the individual or any elder of their family,‚Äù explained Mishra. Sandeep Dwivedi, convenor of Ganga Samagra (trans-Yamuna), said, ‚ÄúIn many areas, this tradition of planting saplings is being introduced as a ‚Äòmanglik‚Äô (pious) event, because of which locals are taking great interest in it. People, especially those around Manaiya Ghat, Mungari, Bendo, Rampur, Kavara of Karchana, are planting saplings in such events. Last year, 585 saplings were planted by the organisation. Of these, 335 plants are safe so far.‚Äù The volunteers of Ganga Samagra are engaged in reviving the ponds along with the plantation drive. District coordinator Ramshiromani Mishra said that the campaign to plant and save plants is being run especially around the ponds by the organisation. This will help in rainwater harvesting. ‚ÄúApart from Uruva, Shivkapura, Paranipur, panchkol saplings are also being planted in Jagauti of Karchana and Gaharpur village of Meja. A target has also been set to revive the ponds of Judapur Bihar, Serawa, Berawa, Meendara, Durvasa Ashram, Malaka, Badanpur, Jamunipur, Tiwaripur of Gangapar and Katwarupur. Work has already begun in some places. The ponds are being deepened at all these places, along with the planting of panchkol saplings,‚Äù said the district coordinator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/volunteers-of-ganga-samagra-to-plant-panchkol-saplings-along-ganga/articleshow/84301555.cms||---

The figures, which had touched the one lakh-mark two months ago, have recorded a 10-time fall. For instance, there were 1,10,804 active cases in the state on May 9, which came down to 1,018 on July 9. Similarly, Patna, which had over 22,589 active cases on May 9, recorded 179 cases on July 9. According to the data shared by the health department, Patna was the only district with 100 active cases on July 9. While Darbhanga and Kishanganj had nearly 50 cases, all other districts had less than 50. Kaimur, Aurangabad and Buxar, which had less than 10 active cases on Friday, had registered 379, 3,495 and 1,216 active cases, respectively, on May 9. Although a significant dip in the number of active cases is being witnessed across the state, experts fear that violation of safety norms and Covid-appropriate behaviour may lead to the third wave of the pandemic. ‚ÄúWe may have overcome the second wave, but the threat of the third wave looms large over the state. It is, therefore, important for us to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour,‚Äù Dr Ajay Kumar, the senior vice-president of Bihar branch of the Indian Medical Association, told TOI on Saturday. He also laid stress on the need for vaccination as ‚Äúit may save Bihar from another wave‚Äù.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/active-covid-cases-in-bihar-record-10-time-fall-in-2-months/articleshow/84303793.cms||Sheezan Nezami

After the acquirement of 76-acre of land for ISBT rail depot, the construction work is likely to begin from September. District land acquisition officer Pramod Kumar said the social impact assessment was done plot-wise in Ranipur and Pahadi. ‚ÄúThe notification for the same will be released in next 2-3 days after which the land acquisition will begin on consent of the villagers. The work has been delayed due to Covid pandemic,‚Äù he added. As per the Land Revenue Act 2013, the state government would fix the rate of the land that is to be acquired at Ranipur and Pahadi for the construction of IBT rail depot. The depot will have two workshop and two inspection bays, eight stabling lines which can accommodate 32 three-coach trains and auto-coach washing plan. The administrative area will have an auditorium, training school, canteen and operational control centre. An urban development and housing department official said the technical team has completed the engineering work for two stations at ISBT under corridor I and PMCH under corridor II. The construction work on the two major stations would continue parallelly. According to officials, the design of the two stations, depot and casting yard has been prepared by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC). ‚ÄúISBT and PMCH stations will spread over 3-acre of land each. About 71-acre of land for casting yard at Fatuha-Mauza has already been acquired and the civil work has started,‚Äù they said. In the priority corridor, piling work has been completed on 2km stretch from Bhootnath Road to Zero Mile. The total stretch of priority corridor is around 6.1km, which include five elevated stations ‚Äî New Patliputra ISBT, Zero Mile, Bhutnath, Khemnichak and Malahi Pakri. Former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi met the director and managing director of DMRC to discuss the progress of Patna metro project. ‚ÄúDespite the tender being done, the construction work of Patna metro depot has not started due to non-availability of 20 hectares of land. After the laying of foundation stone by the PM on February 17, 2019, only 1% physical progress has been made while the financial achievement is just 3.1% (sic),‚Äù Modi tweeted. Modi said according to the DMRC officials, the work has begun on the priority corridor from ISBT to Malahi Pakari. The Corridor I will be 17.9km-long from Danapur to Khemnichack via Mithapur, of which 7.3km will be elevated and 10.5km underground. The Corridor II will be 14.5km from Patna Junction to ISBT of which 7.9km will be underground and 6.6km elevated. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 9,201.22 crore (excluding land acquisition, which will be borne by the state government).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/process-to-acquire-land-for-metro-rail-depot-begins-in-patna/articleshow/84304020.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Goa||Goa: CCP brands several heritage buildings in Panaji as ‚Äòunsafe‚Äô||PANAJI: The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) has identified 15 unsafe buildings in the state capital, including the historical Clube Nacional building, and has said that they pose a risk to people. CCP commissioner Agnelo Fernandes said that the structures need to be repaired by the owners as soon as possible, or will have to be demolished for safety reasons. CCP has drawn up the list based on a routine inspection of old and dilapidated structures within city limits. The list includes the residences of Maria Fernandes near Confidant Advertising, Andrew Fernandes in Curtin, Tony Lopes behind the post office and another residential structure belonging to Fernando Lobo and Maria Sequeira. ‚ÄúMost of the owners are untraceable. Some of the structures are locked and the owners are abroad. Even the tenants who have been there for decades say it is very difficult to trace the heirs,‚Äù said Fernandes. In 2017, CCP had a list of 11 unsafe buildings, including residential and commercial structures, and with time, the list has grown longer, with the same buildings still finding a mention on CCP‚Äôs list. Though Section 272 of the City of Panaji Corporation Act empowers CCP to serve notices and evict people from unsafe buildings, the status quo continues. ‚ÄúSome of the structures are unoccupied, but if any of them collapse, it could damage vehicles that are parked near those structures,‚Äù he said. Section 271 of the CCP Act empowers the commissioner to declare a building or structure unfit for habitation if the building is found to be structurally weak. However, in the case of the structures declared unsafe by the CCP in the past, nothing has changed. Meanwhile, CCP‚Äôs four story building next to the fish market, which was amongst the structures declared unsafe and sealed by the CCP in 2017, does not find mention in the 2021 list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ccp-brands-several-heritage-bldgs-in-panaji-as-unsafe/articleshow/84305496.cms||---

Determined to compete in the 2022 edition of the Golden Globe Race (GGR), a solo non-stop circumnavigation without satellite-based navigation aids, the decorated sailor is looking to crowdfund his race. For some, the relentless desire to sail alone for 60,000km through unforgiving seas and unpredictable Nature best describes a daredevil, but for the former naval commander, it is nothing short of a spiritual journey of self discovery. ‚ÄúI believe that you cannot explore your self if you don‚Äôt cut yourself off from this world. When you are with people, you are always dealing with the external world. Being alone for a prolonged duration kind of alters my mind and I get to know myself,‚Äù said Tomy while speaking to TOI. However, before he gets down to his unfinished business with the South Indian Ocean, Tomy has to figure out the part of his puzzle; funds. For a good competitive race, he will need around Rs 4 crore, but he knows that this may be a tough ask through crowdfunding. He has also reached out to corporate sponsors but has yet to hear anything concrete. His online campaign (https://bit.ly/3k2ifW6)has raised Rs 3.5 lakh. ‚ÄúFor me it is very simple, get a boat, do a 2,000-mile training on it, get it ready and I am set,‚Äù said Tomy, who has settled in Goa with his family. This time around, he is not building a boat since it entails a lot of time, money and compliance. Instead, he plans to purchase a pre-owned boat from Europe and refit it for the race. While his earlier 32-foot yacht, the Thuriya, was a two-masted boat, Tomy has set his eyes on a couple of single-masted 36-footer yachts. Forced out of the Golden Globe Race in 2018 after a severe storm wrecked his yacht and left him injured in one of the remotest parts of the Southern Indian Ocean, the Kirti Chakra winner says he has unfinished business with the oceans. A massive multinational rescue mission helped rescue Tomy who now has titanium rods inserted into his spine. The former naval aviator, who retired from the Indian Navy in January, is candid when he says that out at sea is where he belongs. During his first solo circumnavigation, Tomy began to struggle with the idea of returning to shore after crossing Cape Horn. ‚ÄúI think for anybody to survive through prolonged solitude, where every moment you are worried whether you will survive, you need to have some sort of philosophical strength. In my first circumnavigation, I had to train myself to get back to land,‚Äù said Tomy. He also believes that a nation that looks to the sea, which ventures out and imbibes the maritime spirit can change its ethos. ‚ÄúIf a generation of Indians go out to sea, we will be a completely different nation. Sailing nations such as the Netherlands are the best example. You are honest, helpful, you value time, you learn a lot of skills and it gives you patience. And when you come on land, the small problems stop bothering you. Going to sea helps in character development,‚Äù said Tomy. The 1968 Golden Globe was the first ever around the world yacht race. Open to sailors young and old, it is affordable in 32-36ft strong, recycled, seaworthy yet simple yachts which lack technology, satellite communications and GPS and autopilot systems. The 2022 edition has already received around 30 entrants from 11 countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tomy-ready-to-cast-off-again-starts-crowdfunding-to-raise-funds-for-race/articleshow/84306077.cms||Newton Sequeira

Education minister and senior JD(U) leader Vijay Kumar Choudhary was also present at the JD(U) office here when Singh rejoined the party. Soon after his return to the JD(U), Manjeet was appointed vice-president of the party‚Äôs state unit. ‚ÄúIt is like ‚Äòghar wapsi‚Äô (homecoming) for Manjit, the two-term former MLA of Baikunthpur. He has been a devoted leader of the JD(U), but dissociated himself from the party for some time. Now he has returned to his old home,‚Äù Lalan said. Taking a swipe at the RJD, which claimed on social media last week that Manjeet would join the party, the JD(U) MP said, ‚ÄúManjeet, then an independent, had lost from the Baikunthpur seat in the 2020 assembly election as RJD had campaigned against him.‚Äù Manjeet had earlier represented the Baikunthpur assembly seat twice ‚Äî first in 2010 and then in 2015. However, he quit the JD(U) and decided to contest the election as an independent when the seat went to the BJP‚Äôs kitty as part of seat-sharing formula in the NDA. Manjeet said he was a true follower of CM Nitish Kumar‚Äôs ideology of ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù. ‚ÄúI virtually consider him as my political father. I am very much pleased with the response that I have received from the senior leaders of the JD(U),‚Äù he said. Manjeet described his dissociation from the JD(U) as his ‚Äòvanvas‚Äô. It is learned it was JD(U)‚Äôs Dhamdaha MLA Lesi Singh who persuaded Manjeet not to join the RJD and also organised his meeting with Nitish. ‚ÄúManjeet‚Äôs return will strengthen the organisation,‚Äù JD(U) state president Kushwaha said. Manjeet‚Äôs picture with leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had gone viral on social media on July 1. A senior RJD leader had claimed that Manjeet would join the party on July 3. Referring to the controversy over switching sides, Manjeet said, ‚ÄúI had gone to present a book on Jaya Prakash Narayan to Tejashwi. This led to the speculation that I will join RJD.‚Äù Meanwhile, the JD(U) on Saturday released a list of its 87 technical cell office bearers. The list contained names of party‚Äôs 15 vice-presidents, 30 general secretaries and 42 secretaries. The cell is headed by Ram Charitra Prasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ex-baikunthpur-mla-returns-to-jdu-made-partys-state-vp/articleshow/84303918.cms||Ramashankar

The existing population of the city is estimated to be around 23.5 lakh, while the district has about 42.9 lakh people. There are about 970 females per every 1,000 males in Vizag city. The literacy rate has improved to about 82% in Vizag. The Population Research Centre, in its report last year, projected that the population of Andhra Pradesh would reach the 5.4 crore mark by 2031. As per the report, the projected population growth rate in Andhra Pradesh will see a drastic decline between 2026 and 2030 to 1.7%, compared to 5.4% between 2016 and 2020. A gradual decline in the crude birth rate is also projected. Reproductive and maternal health care and public policies have been playing a role in the decline of the mortality rate. Meanwhile, the decline in total fertility rate is attributed to changes in society that include changing lifestyles, environmental conditions, the impact of technology on pregnant women, urbanisation and socio-economic conditions of the family, etc. The report suggested encouraging traditional food practices and lifestyle for individual well-being. It highlighted the indigenous methods of communities within agricultural systems to help increase life expectancy and minimise lifestyle diseases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizags-population-to-cross-30l-mark-by-35/articleshow/84302422.cms||---

The shocking incident was reported from Jodimamidivalasa under Salur mandal in Vizianagaram district. While the younger daughter, identified as K Pravani (2), died on the spot, elder daughter K Siri (4) has been admitted to a local hospital. Her condition is stated to be stable but critical. Police said the accused, identified as K Prasad, was married to Lakshmi about six years ago. Though they were blessed with two daughters, Prasad, who is a daily wage labourer, wanted a son and had been harassing his wife for not giving him a male heir. On Friday night, Prasad picked up a fight with Lakshmi over the same issue and in a fit of anger, banged his daughters against the wall. Realising the gravity of his crime, Prasad fled after the incident. Lakshmi, with the help of neighbours, rushed the bleeding children to a local hospital where Pravani was declared brought dead. Following a complaint by the heartbroken wife, police have registered a case and launched a manhunt for the accused. The body of the deceased has been shifted to a government hospital for postmortem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/man-bangs-daughters-head-against-wall-one-dies/articleshow/84302457.cms||Nalla.Babu

Close to 20% of the VMRDA area (or 1,230 square kilometres) is a natural and sensitive area, which requires protection and integration into the human landscape to retain its environmental significance. The VMRDA area covers a coastal length of 250 km. At present, the total land use covered by recreation, forest and hills constitutes a total green coverage of 12% of VMRDA area. If the plantation around lakes and rivers is considered, this becomes a green cover of 17%, which is much lower than the state and national average. However, this green cover still acts as the backbone for the ecological footprint of the region. Other natural features include coastal sandy areas, mangrove forests, rivers, water bodies and open spaces. Different environmental features also add to the sensitivity of the region towards large-scale developments. As per the draft master plan-2041 framework for environmental management of key sensitive areas, the entire VMRDA is broadly classified into six key designations for its environmental sustainability, protection and conservation. The areas are divided based on characteristics, physiography and natural resources. Each zone will have its own development and protection policy, and maintaining it will facilitate a better environment and healthy surroundings in the VMRDA. The draft master plan also highlights dwindling water resources. Apart from the continuous drought and deficit rainfall prevailing in the last few years, developments and habitations in the catchment area have blocked inflows into water bodies. Meanwhile, coastal areas in the region are subject to intense development pressures by way of tourism, marine fishing activity and industrial infrastructure. In a bid to implement the conservation and protection strategy, the master plan does not propose intensive land uses along the coast other than such permitted under the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification 2011 and subsequent amendments. No other activity, not ancillary to the fishing activity or any conservation activity, has been proposed as part of the coastal areas. The draft master plan also recommends protecting all lakes, lakefronts and all critical channels of lakes through mandatory open and green buffers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vmrda-draft-plan-flags-need-to-save-critical-natural-assets/articleshow/84302297.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

However, the things might begin to change from Monday onwards, as light to moderate rainfall, along with heavy rainfall at isolated places in the catchment areas of the north Bihar rivers, have been forecast for Saturday and Sunday, according to the flood bulletin released by the state water resources department (WRD). Only Burhi Gandak was flowing above the danger level along its downstream, including Sikandarpur in Muzaffarpur, Samastipur and Rosera rail bridges. Its water level was also rising in Khagaria district. Otherwise, the water discharge through the Birpur barrage across the Kosi increased over the last 12 hours. While water discharge was 1.35 cusecs at 6am, it increased to 1.61 lakh cusecs by the afternoon. The basins of the tributaries of the Kosi in Nepal received heavy rainfall at some places in the last 48 hours. That apart, people living in the lower reaches of the Gandak basin had a sigh of relief, as the water level fell over the last 24 hours. The water discharge through the Valmikinagar barrage across the river was 1.80 cusecs at 6am, but fell to 1.61 lakh cusecs in the afternoon. The fall in the discharge level is slow, which implied that its water has not yet drained out from the flooded plains in the lower reaches. Further, the hilly tributaries of the Gandak originating in Nepal have also been carrying water into it, besides causing erosion along its banks, reports reaching here said. Those marooned by floodwaters from Kamla and Adhwara will have relief from the fact that these rivers are flowing below the danger level at Jainagar in its upper reaches and also at Jhanjharpur along its downstream. Incidentally, the volume of water flowing through the Sone has slightly increased, indicating rainfall received in the basins of north Koel and other rivers. The water discharge through the Indrapuri barrage was 2,597 cusecs in the morning, but it increased to 9,379 cusecs in the afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/kosi-still-in-spate-but-small-rivers-relent-in-bihar/articleshow/84303874.cms||Abhay Singh

The woman was alone at home when the incident occurred. An empty cartridge was recovered from the spot. Senior police officials including ACP Kalyanpur Dinesh Shukla reached the spot and initiated investigation. Shashi alias Angoori, daughter of Ramdas, a resident of Shivli‚Äôs Singhpur, was married to one Santosh Kumar of Atholi village of Auraiya about 12 years ago. However, Shashi since the past six years was staying separately following a dispute with her husband. The couple had three sons. Two sons used to live with Shashi while one son lived with her husband. Shashi had also bought a plot in Maqsoodabad and built a house and was staying in it for the past two years. ‚ÄúAs per her siblings, she had come back to her Nai Basti Maqsoodabad house from her maternal home on Friday. Her two sons were at their maternal grand-parents home. At 2 o‚Äôclock in the night, the people of the locality came across a gunshot sound. When they woke up in the morning, they saw Shashi lying in a pool of blood near the cot on the terrace of her house. Soon, they informed them following which they rushed to the spot and alerted the local police,‚Äù said a police official privy to the investigation. ‚ÄúSubsequently, the police along with a forensic team reached the spot and broke open the locks to gain access into the house. During investigation, it came to fore that assailants had shot in the head of Shashi. A cartridge was found on the cot on which she was sleeping, besides two cups of tea and packets of chips recovered from the house. We are investigating the matter. Preliminary findings indicated that someone known to the deceased had committed the murder.

Usually, on Rath Yatra, kids in almost every neighbourhood are seen pulling the small chariots, accompanied by their grandparents or parents. But this time, retailers have apparently bought only a handful of the chariots from artisans, fearing low sale as parents would not allow the children to go outside amid the pandemic.  Manufacturers at Beliaghata and Kumartuli rued poor business. New Ballygunge Road residents Suvajit Dutt and Puja Sengupta drove from Kasba to Rasbehari Avenue and Tollygunge to Hazra, in search of a small rath for their three-and-a-half-year-old daughter, hoping she would be able to celebrate the festival on their terrace and video-call her friends from school. But the couple failed to spot a single seller. ‚ÄúI will try again on Sunday,‚Äù said Sengupta. At Janbazar, 40-year-old Goutam Pramanik was spotted on the road with two small chariots, waiting for buyers. ‚ÄúThe business is at an all-time low. Till 2019, I sold 250-350 chariots over three-four days. This year I haven‚Äôt been able to sell even 20 and still have two left,‚Äù said Pramanik. Beliaghata Canal East Road is home to some 35 families that manufacture chariots. They said they made one-fifth the number of chariots they had made in 2019. ‚ÄúRetailers, who bought 150 to 500 chariots from us, are buying 30-50 chariots. Higher-priced, two- and three-storey chariots are even lower in demand,‚Äù said Bablu Pal, an artisan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-impact-rath-makers-bear-the-brunt-as-kids-stay-off-roads/articleshow/84303633.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

So far, about 8,916 applications have been received from overseas students in over 15 universities, including state government run and self-financed institutions, said sources in the Gujarat government. ‚ÄúAdmissions of 3,111 students have already been confirmed and soon the government will enrol others after proper verification,‚Äù said a senior government official. Gujarat University (GU) has received the highest number of applications, at 2,660, so far for technical courses in various colleges affiliated to it. GU has confirmed the admissions of 1,030 students, said sources. Gujarat Technological University has admitted 809 foreign students; it had received 1,240 applications. MSU in Vadodara has enrolled 541 of the 852 candidates who had applied. Marwadi University, a private institution in Rajkot, got 1,256 applications and 47 students have been given admissions so far, said government sources. National Forensic Sciences University in the state capital of Gandhinagar, which is an Institution of National Importance, has confirmed admissions for 170 candidates of the 315 applications received. It is the world‚Äôs first and only university dedicated to forensics, cybersecurity, digital forensics, and allied sciences. Others such as Swarnim Startup University, Pandit Deendayal Energy University, and Charusat University have confirmed the intake of one, seven, and four foreign candidates respectively. Pandit Deendayal Energy University has received 572 applications from foreign students, said sources. Veer Narmad South Gujarat University has confirmed admissions for 152 foreign candidates of the 276 applicants. The Gujarat government had passed the Gujarat Professional Technical Educational Colleges or Institutions (Regulation of Admission and Fixation of Fees) Bill, 2019. It changed an earlier law that allowed only private colleges to admit students from other places. The new set of rules gives room to foreign students to get admission in any college or institution in the state. The new rules also aimed to reduce the number of government-reserved seats for professional courses and open direct admissions to foreign nationals and students from other Indian states to study in Gujarat. A large number of seats in technical courses remain vacant in the state. ‚ÄúIt seems that the number of candidates wanting to do professional courses is small compared to the total number of approved seats in Gujarat,‚Äù said a government official familiar with the matter. ‚ÄúHence, more than 50% of the seats of self-financed institutions remain vacant after the intake process is carried out by the Admission Committee for Professional Courses (ACPC).‚Äù States such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka capture a large share of foreign students coming to India to pursue higher studies. Gujarat plans to follow a similar path, the official added. According to the new rules, the government-reserved seats in unaided or self-financed colleges have been reduced from 75% to 50%. Also, management-quota seats have been raised from 25% to 50%. This includes 15% non-resident Indian seats, and seats for foreign students and students from any state (including Gujarat).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-close-to-10000-foreign-students-target/articleshow/84305608.cms||Bharat Yagnik

A glimmer of hope is seen for the city's troubled WHC heritage buildings after seven havelis, whose owners now volunteered to register their properties under Ahmedabad‚Äôs latest WHC list. A gazette regarding the same has been published and will be assigned TDR. In fact six more owners have submitted applications for listing their properties under WHC. ‚ÄúThe owners of these seven buildings had been trying since September 2019, but it was in February that their structures were listed. Also we are processing six additional applications for WHC listing. This is because of growing awareness,‚Äù said a senior AMC official. The gazette was published in February 15, but the process of assigning TDR to these buildings has just begun in the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). There are six additional buildings for which the process is on. Of these seven buildings that were listed ‚Äî three in Khadia have been categorised as Grade 2A ‚Äî which has high heritage value, while three others that are in Khadia and Shahpur areas are listed Grade-2B. The properties are located in Lakha Patel ni pol, Desai ni Pol, Kapalidas ni pol, Dhal ni pol, Sankdi Sheri and Moto Suthar no Wado. Owners of these listed properties have even submitted their suggestions to the civic body ‚Äî requesting the the government to declare the roughly 500 hectare WHC precinct as an SEZ-Urban Enterprise Zone (UEZ) that is meant specifically for Urban Revitalization, in this case, Heritage Revitalization. The walled city precinct has close to 2,700 certified heritage structures located within 2 square miles. Of these, close to 2,000 heritage properties are under private ownership. ‚ÄúAhmedabad is already aiming to host the Olympics, like other Unesco World heritage European cities. It is a major economic opportunity for heritage, tourism and handcraft UEZ.. Heritage cannot be protected through coercion but only through stakeholder participation. Participation is fuelled by economic incentives as extended for SEZ‚Äôs,‚Äù says entrepreneur, heritage custodian, and executive committee member at Indian Heritage Hotel Association, Abhay Mangaldas. ‚ÄúI have three buildings that are listed in the gazette as WHC buildings. We had been trying since September 2019. Covid was one of the major reasons for delay.

---||Delhi||Haryana behind Delhi water crisis: DJB vice-chairman Raghav Chadha||NEW DELHI: Delhi Jal Board vice-chairman Raghav Chadha blamed the Haryana government on Saturday for the water supply woes being faced by the national capital. He said the neighbouring state was releasing 221 cusec less raw water in the Yamuna, Carrier Lined Channel and Delhi Sub-Branch Canal. Chadha appealed to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to release adequate water so that supply in Delhi is not impacted further. ‚ÄúHaryana‚Äôs apathetic behaviour may lead to water scarcity in NDMC and VIP areas, including the PM‚Äôs residence, the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court, the secretariat and major ministries. The water supply in parts of Central, West and South Delhi will also be affected. It is the legal responsibility of the Haryana government to provide water to Delhi as per the Supreme Court orders and other MOUs,‚Äù he said. Chadha said that water production had come down at Chandrawal WTP from 90 MGD to 55MGD, at Wazirabad WTP from 135 to 80 MGD, and at Okhla WTP from 20 to 15 MGD.  ‚ÄúThe daily production from these plants has come down from 245 MGD to 145-150 MGD. Upper Yamuna River Board has directed Haryana to provide an additional 150 cusec of water besides providing the legally prescribed amount of water to Delhiites,‚Äù he claimed. Chadha said that it was the peak summer season in north India and monsoon delay and pandemic had only increased the water demand. ‚ÄúDelhi is dependent on its neighbours for its water supply from the Ganga, the Yamuna and Bhakra Nangal dam,‚Äù he added. DJB also says that the water level in the Wazirabad pond has reached 667.6 ft as against the normal level of 674.5ft because of which parts of cantonment area, south, central, west and north Delhi may face water shortage. Chadha said that during summers, Delhi‚Äôs water production used to be between 900 and 920 MGD, while this year, DJB did a record production of up to 945 MGD. ‚ÄúBut as of today, we can see a reduction of 100 MGD because the Haryana government has stopped the water that comes to Delhi,‚Äù he claimed. Under normal circumstances, Delhi‚Äôs water treatment plants supply 935-945 MGD water to the city. DJB has, however, been saying that the city will require extra water supply this year from the neighbouring states in the wake of the delayed monsoon. Vinod Mehta, the principal media advisor to Haryana chief minister, in a tweet responded that complaining is a habit of Delhi‚Äôs AAP government. He further claimed that in the last seven years there has not been a single day when Haryana has released less than the allocated amount of water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/haryana-behind-city-water-crisis-chadha/articleshow/84305572.cms||---

The state housing department issued a government resolution (GR) directing Mhada to complete the stalled redevelopment and hand over tenements to the 672 tenants and the 306 citizens who had won allotments through the authority‚Äôs lottery system. The tenants will be paid rent arrears too. The GR also directs Mhada to utilize all legal means to ensure it gets its lawful share of the redeveloped area. Siddharth Nagar is spread over 47 acres and the developer, Guruashish, allegedly sold parcels of the land to nine other developers without Mhada‚Äôs approval. The matter went to court after the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) pointed out the discrepancies in counting the actual area. It is currently before the Bombay high court and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The cabinet approved the recommendation of the Johny Joseph Committee, allowing Mhada to sell flats at market rates as a one-time concession to recover the redevelopment cost. Mhada will also be allowed a floor space index of 4 on the area that has not been developed. The housing department has issued another GR mandating Mhada to obtain state approval before issuing a letter of intent for redevelopment to a developer for any of its layouts. ‚ÄúOften the residents have to bear the brunt as the project gets stalled for years. Hence, to ensure public good, Mhada will need to submit a detailed proposal to the government, obtain approval and only then issue the NOC and approvals for the project,‚Äù it states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mhada-to-redevelop-patra-chawl-tenants-to-get-rent-arrears-too/articleshow/84303637.cms||Clara Lewis

---||Hyderabad||Officials, sarpanches suspended for slack Palle Pragati work||HYDERABAD: More than a hundred officials and sarpanches were suspended and issued show-cause notices for failing to implement Palle Pragati programme, which began on July 1 all over the state. The action was taken as the officials had not taken up cleanliness drive or were negligent in planting saplings or for not carrying out works under Palle Pragati.  In Rajanna Sircilla district, village secretary of Obulapur Mukhtar Ahmed was issued a memo by collector K Krishna Bhaskar. He was given time up to July 12 to complete the works or face action. Officials found that the village secretary had not distributed saplings to households for planting them as mandated. Similarly, junior panchayat secretary Suresh of Kandikatkur in Ellankathakunta was suspended as he had not even identified the works to be taken up under Palle Pragati. However, this move by the government has not gone down well with some sarpanches who raised their voice. ‚ÄúWhen we are out all day from early in the morning to carry out various works, officers come to the gram panchayat office. When they do not find us, they are initiating action against us. They also insult us in front of villagers and this is not acceptable,‚Äù angry sarpanches, who held a meeting at the MPDO office in Ramadugu mandal in Karimnagar district, said. With CM K Chandrasekhar Rao insisting on making the programme a success, senior officers undertook even surprise visits to the villages to check if government programmes were implemented or not. Some collectors went to the villages on motorcycles as part of their surprise visits. During his visits, Krishna Bhaskar found that sarpanch of Kandikotkur Annadi Karuna had not distributed saplings and no avenue plantation was done. The nursery in the village was also in a bad shape. Karuna was issued a show-cause notice and asked to respond in 48 hours failing which action would be taken under the Panchayat Raj Act. Sangareddy district collector M Hanumantha Rao issued show-cause notices to 23 officials and two sarpanches on July 8. Medak district collector S Harish, who visited Alladurg mandal on July 9, directed that memos be issued to the MPDO, MPO, panchayat secretary and sarpanch||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/officials-sarpanches-suspended-for-slack-palle-pragati-work/articleshow/84307707.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Delhi||Delhi University admission process may start by end of July, says VC||NEW DELHI: Delhi University is likely to begin the admission registration process by July-end or the first week of August, PC Joshi, the varsity‚Äôs vice-chancellor, told TOI on Saturday. According to the VC, the university is all set to announce the dates and the process of admissions this year but is waiting for the decision on Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CUCET) from the University Grants Commission and the CBSE results on July 31. DU also plans to announce the dates for postgraduate and PhD admissions over the next week. Speaking to TOI, Joshi said: ‚ÄúThere are two aspects that we have to consider before announcing the admissions dates. The first is when will we be able to conduct our own DU Entrance Test (DUET) and secondly, clarity is sought on what decision UGC takes regarding CUCET.‚Äù The vice-chancellor informed that DUET is conducted every year ‚Äúfor many of our PG courses and nine undergraduate courses, which will be conducted by the National Testing Agency. But the NTA is already busy with other exams like NEET and would give us a date soon. We are already in touch with them and have had multiple meetings.‚Äù Joshi also said that the varsity was waiting for the decision on CUCET. ‚ÄúIf UGC decides that CUCET will be conducted, then we would go ahead with that. If not, we will continue our admissions through the merit-based format that we have been following for the past few years.‚Äù The admission process at DU, the VC claimed, would began as soon as possible. ‚ÄúOur computer centre is equipped and ready, as they were last year, for admissions. There are certain decisions to be taken, which will be clear once NTA informs us about the dates for DUET or when the government decides on CUCET status. Moreover, there is a new Union minister who has taken charge so he will also take a decision on it soon,‚Äù he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-admission-process-may-start-by-end-of-july-says-vc/articleshow/84305616.cms||---

The district‚Äôs weekly CFR had increased to 1.5% in the first week of May. It rose to 2.3% during the week ending May 19 and kept on increasing ever since during the consequent weeks to 2.7%, followed by 2.9% from May 27 to June 2 and 3% during the June 3-9 period, the health department data revealed. The easing in the CFR started in the second week of June when it fell to 1.8% in the week ending June 16. This was the first time that the case fatality rate went below 2% in the 40 days. The latest week, July 1-7, saw a further drop in CFR to 0.9%. The number of weekly Covid deaths in Pune district during the July 1-7 period dropped more than three-fold in comparison to those recorded during the first few days of June, the data showed. The number of positive cases totalled to 8,204 in the July 1-7 period, a slight rise from the preceding week (June 24-30). However, the number of Covid deaths recorded was 80 in the latest week (July 1-7) as against 120 during the week before. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, ‚ÄúCovid death rate begins falling almost two to three weeks after the number of cases starts dropping. Covid cases started declining in the first week of June, and the death rate started coming down from the second fortnight of the month. In conjunction with this trend, hospital ICU and oxygen beds are also seeing relatively less Covid admissions now.‚Äù ‚Äú However, Pune‚Äôs weekly positivity rate has remained static (around 6%) during the past few weeks,‚Äù Deshmukh said. He said positivity was not dropping because of the easing of restrictions to an extent, lack of adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour like wearing masks and people‚Äôs inflow to Pune from districts, such as Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli, which are witnessing high positivity rate. Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharati Hospital, said, ‚ÄúThe number of Covid admissions in hospitals has remained static since the past month. As the number of Covid patients is few, the deaths are less too. The number of backlog Covid cases, such as those who are serious and admitted to ICUs, is also currently less. A chunk of backlog cases (patients staying in hospitals for a prolonged period) has now cleared. The number of critical cases, which would be over 1,000 at a time in a hospital, has now dropped to 150-200. Referrals of critical patients from other districts to Pune have also significantly decreased in the last week or so.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/at-0-9-punes-cfr-drops-to-70-day-low/articleshow/84305603.cms||Neha Madaan

Based thereon, we dispose of this suo motu public interest litigation,‚Äù stated a bench of justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar. The court had taken cognisance of a TOI report dated July 24, 2019, which stated that Kala Academy, one of Panaji‚Äôs most iconic buildings, would see its popular open-air auditorium demolished. TOI had made a reference to a report prepared by the Goa engineering college (GEC), proposing the demolition, and stated that yet another report is awaited from the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (GSIDC) on the issue of the proposed demolition. During the hearing, advocate general Devidas Pangam submitted that a work order for Rs 39 crore has been issued for structural repairs and renovation works. The work order includes waterproofing work, electrical work, HVAC, and external drainage work allied with civil works of Kala Academy. Amicus curiae in the case V A Lawande said that the petition can be disposed of as the government proposes to repair and renovate the structure. In the year 2019, the director of art and culture, holding additional charge as the member secretary of the Kala Academy, submitted to the high court that although the state government had not taken any decision to demolish the open-air auditorium, ‚Äúother options‚Äù would be explored only if restoration of the structure was not possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/wont-demolish-ka-amphitheatre-govt-tells-hc/articleshow/84305698.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 3 yrs after man‚Äôs death, kin to pay pending hosp bill with interest||Mumbai: Coming to the aid of Bhatia Hospital, Tardeo, a civil court this week ordered the relatives of a patient, who died of a stomach ailment in 2018, to pay up the pending bill amount of Rs 4.30 lakh. ‚ÄúDocuments are system-generated bills prepared in due course and they can be taken into account while considering claim of plaintiff [hospital]. The plaintiff has proved his [hospital representative] claim with help of sufficient oral and documentary evidence,‚Äù the court said. The hospital also claimed interest of 18% per annum but the court said it was exorbitant and awarded an interest of 7%. ‚ÄúConsidering all attaining circumstances, it appears that the patient was seriously ill and his relatives were not in a position to pay such huge amount towards bill of the treatment. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to impose interest at the rate of 18%. Average interest rate of nationalised banks is 7%,‚Äù the court said. The hospital filed a suit in court on April 24, 2019, against the patient‚Äôs brother, Arun Singh from Dombivli, and uncle Rajendra Singh. The patient, Avdhesh Kumar Singh, had been admitted to hospital on June 26, 2018 with severe stomach pain. The hospital said that in the course of treatment, a surgery was performed. Singh died on July 14. It was submitted that while the total bill amount was Rs 7.75 lakh, Singh‚Äôs relatives paid only Rs 3.45 lakh. The hospital then issued a legal notice on October 8, 2018. While Arun received the notice, the payment was not made. Hence, the hospital filed the suit for recovery of money. Summons were sent to the relatives but envelopes were returned with the endorsement, ‚Äòunclaimed‚Äô. After waiting for a reasonable amount of time, the court decided to pass an ex parte order in August 2019. While deciding the matter, the court said that hospital documents clarified details of expenses incurred each day during Singh‚Äôs treatment. ‚ÄúDocuments are system-generated bills prepared in due course and they can be taken into account while considering claim of the plaintiff,‚Äù the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-yrs-after-mans-death-kin-to-pay-pending-hosp-bill-with-interest/articleshow/84307358.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Later, in a purported video which went viral on social media, ASP Etawah Prashant Kumar Prasad could be heard saying that the BJP people had brought bombs, besides they had pelted bricks stones on policemen and also misbehaved with him. ‚ÄúSir, they had brought stones and misbehaved with me. The BJP people had brought bombs too,‚Äù ASP (City) Prashant Kumar Prasad, was heard saying this during a telephonic conversation with his seniors. The video footage was apparently shot during the ongoing voting for the post of block head in the district, on Saturday afternoon, when ASP City Prashant Kumar Prasad tried to pacify the dispute between BJP and SP supporters, who had assembled near the barricades with their leaders to support their respective candidates. Later, additional police force was requisitioned to disperse the trouble makers. Cops also fired tear gas shells to control the crowd. SSP Etawah Brijesh Kumar, meanwhile, told reporters that there were stone-pelting and firing incidents reported during polling at Badhpura block. ‚ÄúThings were going on smoothly. People were maintaining a distance of 500 metres. Then suddenly people came close to 200 metres where the polling was underway. When the policemen stopped them near the barricade, the crowd pelted stones and also fired bullets. Policemen came into action and dispersed the mob by applying force. As of now the police is trying to zero in on the troublemakers with the help of video footage. Action would be taken, after their identification. Also, a case will be lodged on the basis of video footage,‚Äù said Singh. On being questioned, if BJP workers will be booked, the SSP said, ‚ÄúWe are scanning the footage and whoever will be found guilty, will face action. Nearly seven cartridges have been recovered from the spot.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/etawah-block-tense-after-firingstone-pelting-during-voting/articleshow/84303569.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Doses fairly distributed, Maharashtra is at No. 2, says Centre||PUNE: All 12 crore Covid vaccine doses for July have been distributed fairly among states (depending on population size) and demands for more will have to wait until supply improves, health ministry officials have said. ‚ÄúUttar Pradesh is followed by Maharashtra, Bihar and West Bengal in vaccine allocation,‚Äù an official from the ministry said. On Friday, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had said that unless supply from the Centre improves, the state would not be able to streamline its vaccination programme. Maharashtra has been allocated 1.15 crore doses for July. It has asked for 1.5 crore doses. The health ministry official, when asked about the state‚Äôs request, said any addition to its allocated supply will lead to gaps in supply and demand in other states. The official said, ‚ÄúGap in (vaccine) demand and supply is a global issue. Current vaccine manufacturers have increased their production by four times, but demand has gone up too. That‚Äôs why we started with priority groups (health and frontline workers), followed by vulnerable groups and then moved on to 45-plus and 18-plus groups.‚Äù The official said the Centre is not doubting Maharashtra‚Äôs ability to ramp up its vaccine drive, but cannot send more doses as supplies are limited. ‚ÄúVaccine is a biological product and has to undergo the necessary checks before distribution. Even if states demand immediate supplies, these processes have to be carried out, which will delay the supply. Consistent quality of supply has to be ensured and that takes time,‚Äù said the official who didn‚Äôt wish to be named. He said that vaccine ‚Äúeagerness‚Äù has increased after the second wave of the pandemic, adding that production has been improved. ‚ÄúVaccine production has been increased from 2.5 crore to 12 crore. Work is on, on all fronts. We are also adding vaccines from more manufacturers. But all this will take time. By next month, we will see the supply improving further,‚Äù the official said. Officials also confirmed that the Central government is committed to allocating 50 crore doses till July and 135 crore vaccine doses between August and December this year. Authorities are also expecting daily vaccinations in the country to increase from 50 lakh to a crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-doses-fairly-distributed-maha-is-at-no-2-says-centre/articleshow/84305641.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Nagpur||Overjoyed bar owner worships minister‚Äôs photo for lifting liquor ban||CHANDRAPUR: There is a wave of joy among liquor sellers after the prohibition was revoked here after six long years. A video showing a jubilant beer bar operator carrying out ‚Äòaarti‚Äô of Chandrapur guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar ‚Äî who is seen as the architect of revocation of prohibition ‚Äî was doing the rounds. Former liquor licence holders have started renewing the suspended excise permits of their liquor outlets and beer bars. The state excise department has issued 308 liquor permits so far. Liquor sale is at an all-time high at all the outlets and beer bars across the district, and sellers are thankful to Wadettiwar for his initiative to withdraw the prohibition. There is such euphoria over withdrawal of the ban that people have started venerating Wadettiwar for his deed. The beer bar operator seen in the video went to the extent of carrying out aarti of a picture (portrait) of Wadettiwar in a reputed bar and restaurant located at Lohara. The man in the video is identified as one Ganesh Goradwar. The video pans out to show the shelf holding liquor bottles in the bar where aarti was performed. The video posted on social media has drawn a slew of comments, some censuring and others ridiculing the act of the man. Meanwhile, instances of liquor being sold at rates higher than the maximum retail price (MRP) printed on the bottles after revocation of prohibition have come to fore in the district. Following multiple complaints received to this effect, the state excise department is set to launch a drive to curb the practice in authorized liquor shops and beer shops. Soon after state excise department cleared the licences, many beer bars, beer shops, country liquor and foreign liquor shops were started across the district. Even after a week, a large crowd of tipplers continues to throng these places following the Covid curfew after 4 pm. Taking advantage of the same, these authorized liquor sellers have started selling liquor bottles at rates higher than the MRP.  There are complaints about liquor being sold to customers having no liquor drinking permits. The excise department is also keen on checking the sale registers of the liquor sellers to verify how liquor was sold to so many people without drinking permits. The catch is that all the liquor consumption licences in Chandrapur had lapsed after liquor was banned in Chandrapur in 2015. As the excise department did not issue any fresh liquor drinking permits, legally no person is authorized to purchase liquor in Chandrapur. Still, all the bars and shops have bumper sales every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/overjoyed-bar-owner-worships-mins-photo-for-lifting-liquor-ban/articleshow/84302070.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Amritsar||Punjab: No Talwandi Sabo unit likely to be restored before 48 hours||BATHINDA: At a time when Punjab is reeling under severe power crisis, no unit of Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL) is expected to be operational in the next 48 hours. Till then, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) will have to depend more on purchasing power from outside. The second unit of TSPL is expected to start functioning in about a week while the third, which broke down on March 8, is likely to be revived by the end of this month. Trouble for the plant began in March, when its first unit broke down, then snag hit another nearly a week ago and the third and last unit also shut down on Friday. Now, the 1,980MW supercritical thermal plant situated at Banawala village in Mansa is not generating any electricity when the demand in Punjab is nearly at an all-time high mainly due to delayed monsoon. In a press release on Saturday, the TSPL mentioned that restoration of one of these units is expected within 48 hours. ‚ÄúWe are targeting all the three units of TSPL to be operational by end of the month and functional to the full capacity," it stated. One of the major reasons for such frequent breakdown is due to restrictions on coal import. ‚ÄúThis has led to dependence on usage of domestic coal, which has high ash content. We have not been able to get adequate low ash coal, and high ash content coal results in frequent unit breakdowns,‚Äù according to TSPL. PSPCL CMD A Venu Prasad said that despite no power generation from TSPL, they were able to meet the demand of 12,500MW on Friday and Saturday and had been supplying eight-hour electricity to agriculture sector. ‚ÄúWe have got more corridor and are purchasing 7,800MW during day time and 8,000 MW during the night,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/no-talwandi-sabo-unit-likely-to-be-restored-before-48-hours/articleshow/84307387.cms||Neel Kamal

While the cadaver donation was hit by Covid-19 in 2020, the entire year had recorded 36 such donations. In comparison, the first six months of 2021 have witnessed 25 donations or 70% of the last year‚Äôs donation. Dr Pranjal Modi, vice-chancellor of Gujarat University of Transplantation Sciences (GUTS) and convenor of State Organ & Tissue Transplantation Organization (SOTTO), said that the drop in Covid-19 cases have resulted in the rise in donations. ‚ÄúAll donations are conducted with utmost care and following Covid protocols. Each donation reduces dependency on living donors. To promote cadaver organ donation, we have launched online donor cards in Gujarati where the citizens can can scan a QR code or fill up a link and give their details to get the card,‚Äù said Dr Modi. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not only to ensure getting the consent of the person, but also educating them about the process involved such as brain death and instil confidence in it.‚Äù The SOTTO data showed that 54% of the hearts retrieved were transplanted out of the state. In the past one-and-a-half years, a total of 11 hearts were retrieved out of which five were transplanted within the state, whereas others went to patients in Chennai, Mumbai, New Delhi and Hyderabad. Likewise, 14 lungs were retrieved, all of which were sent to other centres through ROTTO and NOTTO as the state doesn‚Äôt have a lung transplant programme so far. Nilesh Mandlewala, founder of Surat-based Donate Life Foundation, said that the pandemic surely was a major challenge, but with slow return of normalcy, the donations have also increased. ‚ÄúRecently, lungs of a patient from Surat were transplanted in a woman in Maharashtra whose lungs were completely ravaged by Covid-19 infection. Need of the hour is to create awareness about protocols at all levels, establishing a trustworthy system for the relatives of the brain-dead patients, and coordination like clockwork among agencies if the organs are being sent outside the state,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/70-of-last-years-organ-donation-level-achieved/articleshow/84305775.cms||Parth Shastri

He allegedly worked in collusion with junior accountant Sajjan Singh Gujjar, arrested on Friday evening from Ajmer.‚ÄúWe have taken both the accused on remand till July 14. Both will be interrogated on different issues,‚Äù said DG (ACB) BL Soni.Sources said Poswal claimed to be a close associate of a relative of one of the commission‚Äôs members. ‚ÄúPoswal claimed he worked as an aide for a close relative of one of the RPSC members. We are investigating his suspected ties,‚Äù an official told TOI.‚ÄúPoswal‚Äôs alleged claims of being connected to highly placed officials within the commission who could influence marks of an interview needs to be examined. Therefore, the interrogation during the remand period will especially focus on finding out the veracity of his claims,‚Äù the official added.The ACB on Saturday searched Gurjar‚Äôs office and said both knew each other. Poswal‚Äôs arrest has added a fresh twist to the ACB‚Äôs probe because earlier the case was confined only to the Gurjar‚Äôs trap. But Poswal‚Äôs arrest may unravel new facts. The RPSC at present is conducting interviews of RAS- 2018 exams for 1,051 posts. Two more days are required before the interview process is concluded. After that, the commission will declare a list of successful candidates and send the list to the state government for appointments. The commission had formed different boards to complete the interview process.RPSC says exam process unaffected Jaipur: The RPSC chairman Dr. Bhupendra Singh said the RAS 2018 selection process will remain unaffected by the ACB‚Äôs action. He said a junior accountant has no ability to influence either the exam or the selection process and the second person arrested by the ACB is a private person with no relation to the commission. The RPSC said there is proper transparency in the process. New arrest adds a fresh twist to ACB probeJaipur: The Rajasthan anti-corruption bureau (ACB) widened its probe into the bribes-for-marks case following the arrest of Narendra Singh Poswal.

On World Population Day, experts claimed that coercive population control measures are not the solution and could instead lead to a potential increase in sex selection practices. This is likely to have a negative impact on the child sex ratio, affecting central government campaigns such as the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao programme. Instead, focus must be laid on bring about an awareness and encouraging them to make an informed decision. Informed consent and dignity are two areas which are repeatedly compromised when it comes to delivery of contraceptive services. ‚ÄúBoth temporary and permanent methods of contraception should be made available and accessible to all. There is a need that through public health care system people are informed to make appropriate choices without any coercion,‚Äù says Chhaya Pachauli, director, Prayas, Centre for Health Equity. ‚ÄúThe entire family planning programme must also be realigned to shift from a population control focus to that of protecting reproductive rights and choices,‚Äù she adds. Rajasthan‚Äôs population in 2021 is estimated to be 79.28 million (7.92 crore) with its youth and adolescent population pegged at 32 per cent. ‚ÄúAccording to the fourth National Family Health Survey (2015-16), more than 35 per cent of girls in Rajasthan are married before the age of 18. The 2020 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) survey states that in Rajasthan 12.5 per cent of girls aged 15-16-year-old drop out of school due to diverse reasons, including early marriage and childbearing. The COVID-19 pandemic has further deteriorated the situation and has highlighted the need to invest in our young to convert them into demographic bonus,‚Äù says Dr Dhirendra Kumar (Population Scientist and Dean, IIHMR University). Divya Santhanam, senior state programme manager, Population Foundation of India says, ‚ÄúIn Rajasthan, work is being done by grassroots agencies and the government to promote the importance of education for girls, family planning and dispersal of information about sexual and reproductive health. The pandemic had an impact on equal access to contraceptives and safe abortions and increased the risk of teen pregnancies but the government has shown a willingness to address these issues with its outreach programs and network of adolescent friendly health centres.‚Äù For Rajasthan‚Äôs youth population, family planning and access to contraceptives is a critical element of the primary care component, given its crucial role in delaying first births, ensuring spacing between births, lowering maternal and child mortality, and preventing unsafe abortions. Action Research and Training for Health (ARTH) in Udaipur aims at increasing and expanding reproductive choice among women by giving them options to choose which contraception they would want to use. ‚ÄúBy late April 2020, we started seeing young women ‚Äî mothers of 1 to 2 children ‚Äî with anxiety writ across their faces, seeking a quick means to avoid another pregnancy after their husbands abruptly returned from cities, jobless. They were clear that this was not the time to become pregnant, and yet there was no transport to reach health facilities and government workers were busy with Covid surveys. Several others presented with unwanted pregnancies," said Dr Sharad Iyengar, chief executive of the organisation. He added that stepped up doorstep delivery of moving supplies into barricaded villages. The increase in uptake of oral contraceptive pills, condoms and single use emergency pills - which the organisation supplied even during the pandemic - was unprecedented. ‚ÄúThe focus must be on simple options that allowed self care by young women and men to avert a personal crisis,‚Äù he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/coercive-population-control-measures-not-effective-say-experts/articleshow/84305703.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||DSGMC prez looking to flee: Former chief||Amritsar: Relations between the sitting and former presidents of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) hit an all-time low after former chief Paramjit Singh Sarna asked the ‚Äòsangat‚Äô on Saturday to watch the activities of incumbent Manjinder Singh Sirsa. Sarna accused the present management of being "knee deep in corruption and looking to flee India once the international flights resume". On July 9, based on a case filed by one of Sarna‚Äôs men, a Delhi court had prohibited Manjinder Singh Sirsa from leaving the country till further orders. Accepting that his supporter had filed the case, SAD (D) president Sarna said: "Alert us or the police if you notice that Sirsa is up to anything suspicious. They (the Sirsa group) should be brought to justice." Sirsa replied that he was appalled by the "level of immaturity in someone who had managed several gurdwaras, medical colleges, and educational institutes". He said: "Being a positive person, I don‚Äôt believe in levelling allegations for the sake of it or making hollow promises. Sarna is jealous of our milestone initiatives." Asked about the delaying of the DSGMC elections, Sarna said: "Delhi state‚Äôs Arvind Kejriwal government had started rectifying electoral rolls as early as last July to let the elections proceed on time, which every Sikh had appreciated. His minister in charge had promised a free and fair contest." On March 29 this year, the dates of nomination and withdrawal were announced. Sarna said: "The voting was scheduled for April 25 but in came the Covid-19 pandemic and we were asked to postpone the elections, given the assurance that when things get better, we wouldn‚Äôt have to repeat the cycle of nominations and withdrawals. But now while some government sources suggest the elections will be on July 18 and the announcement in a day or two, the other sources say it will not be so early." He accused the DSGMC of violating the election code of conduct by making "outlandish promises". Sarna said: "Kejriwal has the file, and he should announce an earlier possible date because some forces want to delay the process." Sources claim that early DSGMC elections might hurt the prospects of Kejriwal‚Äôs Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the Punjab assembly elections if the Badal-backed Sirsa wins.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dsgmc-prez-looking-to-flee-former-chief/articleshow/84307437.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Initially, they though that their sedentary lifestyle and excessive eating may have caused bloating. However, when the stomach kept growing, alarm bells started ringing. By this time, the child could barely sit, stand or even breath properly. Her scans revealed that a massive tumour in the stomach was not only shrinking her diaphragm, but also putting pressure on her kidneys. After a few consultations, the girl was taken to Apollo cancer care centre where surgical oncologist Nitin Singhal and team identified it to be a case of Wilms Tumour, a rapidly growing tumour. The parents were informed that it was a risky surgery. ‚ÄúThe child was too young, but the need of the hour is to ensure that she doesn‚Äôt develop other complications. With a team including anaesthetist Ankit Chauhan and paediatric surgeon Kirti Prajapati, our initial idea was to at least remove a portion of the tumour,‚Äù said Dr Singhal. ‚ÄúBut on the operation theatre, we realized that it was the biggest Wilms Tumour we had dealt with weighing 3.1 kg ‚Äì 22% of the girl‚Äôs total weight of 14 kg!‚Äù The team said that they are submitting the case to an international medical journal as a rare occurrence. ‚ÄúApart from the size and tumour-tobody weight ratio, the case was interesting as the girl had horseshoe kidney ‚Äì where the ends of the kidneys are attached from one side ‚Äì and the tumour had grown from it. The occurrence of Wilms Tumour ‚Äì also known as nephroblastoma, one of the most common kidney cancers among kids ‚Äì on such kidneys is less than 1%,‚Äù said Dr Singhal. The child was discharged on the fifth day of the surgery after the first dose of chemotherapy. ‚ÄúShe is recuperating well. It was surely a scary moment for us when we got to know about the huge tumour, but now her breathing and food intake have normalized,‚Äù the girl‚Äôs father told TOI. Dr Singhal said that tumours in paediatric age groups generally have better chances of survival if they are diagnosed in time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3-1kg-tumour-removed-22-of-patients-weight/articleshow/84305742.cms||Parth Shastri

The curious case of Rose was finally unravelled when Jaipur (Rural) police on Saturday arrested two members of a New Delhi-based gang that posed as European women and befriended middle-aged men online, mostly from rural areas. According to Deputy SP (DSP), Govindgarh circle, Sandeep Saraswat, the two accused, Nazrul Alam, 24, and Shivam Rathore, 23, took Rs 1.35 lakh in multiple tranches from the victim. ‚ÄúThe complainant works as a labourer in Sahab Rampura village under Kaladera police station area. He alleged that in February last year, a woman by the name Rose from the UK sent him a friend request online. One day, she told him that she wanted to visit Jaipur with her friends,‚Äù Saraswat told STOI. The victim shared his WhatsApp number with her. In December last year, Rose messaged him that she had arrived at New Delhi International airport with a bagful of gifts for him. ‚ÄúHe was duped into paying Rs 45,000 for some customs duty. The accused then kept tricking him into transferring money into bank accounts under different pretexts,‚Äù Saraswat said. The charade continued for several days as the accused demanded money for currency exchange, security amounts, etc. The accused had paid an amount totalling Rs 1.35 lakh. It was around this time that he got the whiff that something was amiss. The victim, who could barely understand English, asked Rose to return his money. But received no reply. Heartbroken and bereft of his bank savings, he then sought help from a lawyer and filed a complaint. According to Saraswat, a team including Kaladera police and cyber experts tracked down Rose‚Äôs real identity. A team was sent to New Delhi which arrested two accused Nazrul and Shivam. Nazrul is a resident of Tughlakabad, while Shivam is a resident of Mehrauli in New Delhi. ‚ÄúWe suspect there are other members in their gang too. They target gullible people online. We are interrogating both of them to find other members of the gang,‚Äù Sarswat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/delhi-youths-pose-as-rose-from-uk-dupe-city-labourer-of-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/84305695.cms||---

Sis Ram Ola, a prominent Jat leader from the state, had died in 2013. Referring to the Congress leader during a TV debate over the cabinet reshuffle at the Centre by the UPA government under former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Bhatia had said, ‚ÄúJinka hill raha tha purja, unmein Manmohanji dhoond rahe the urja.‚Äù Reacting to his remarks, Gehlot tweeted, ‚ÄúI condemn the remarks made by BJP‚Äôs national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia on Ola. This has created a lot of resentment among the people of the state. BJP National President @J P Nadda should immediately apologise to the people of Rajasthan.‚Äù Gehlot said, ‚ÄúOla protected interests of farmers, being active in social and political fields, for more than 60 years. He was a cabinet minister several times in both the Central and state governments. In 1968, he received the Padma Shri for social service.‚Äù Rajasthan Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra and former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot also criticised Bhatia for making such remarks against the Jat leader. ‚ÄúSuch a remark made about Late Sis Ram Olaji, who is a pride of the farmers and has been honoured with the Padma Shri, is extremely shameful and condemnable. @Dr Satish Pooniaji, do you also agree with such distasteful views of the gentlemen of your party? After all, why does BJP hate the farmers so much?‚Äù asked Dotasra. Pilot tweeted, ‚ÄúIndecent remarks by BJP‚Äôs national spokesperson on senior Congress leader Shishram Ola ji is unfortunate.

However, delayed prosecution sanction sometimes benefit the public servants who apply for bail and even get reinstated. To take every corruption case to its logical conclusion, the ACB compulsorily needs prosecution sanction, which is a tiring exercise. This year, so far, none of the cases registered by ACB has got the prosecution sanction. In many cases, including that of the two SDMs posted in Dausa district, Dausa SP, subinspector of Mumbai police, the ACB is awaiting prosecution sanction from the state and central governments. TOI on Saturday attempted to find out the status of some high-profile cases in which the agency had worked hard to successfully trap the officials. ‚ÄúIn majority of the cases, including of the SDMs Pushkar Mittal and Pinki Meena, IPS officer Manish Agarwal, Baran collector Inder Singh Rao and others, the prosecution sanction is awaited. We have been pursuing it with the departments concerned along with the investigating officers of these cases. Though, in many cases, we have filed the charge-sheet, courts are yet to take cognizance in the absence of prosecution sanction,‚Äù B L Soni, DG, ACB told TOI. ‚ÄúFor IAS and IPS officers, we need prosecution sanction from both the state and central governments. For example, in the case of Inder Singh Rao, the then Baran collector, we have got prosecution sanction from the state government, but it is still awaited from the central government,‚Äù Soni added. According to sources, various departments from whom ACB is demanding prosecution sanction have taken a plea of second wave of Covid-19. ‚ÄúWe are sending them various incriminating documents related to the public servant who was trapped by us. However, the competent authorities are telling us that they could not see the documents due to the second wave of Covid,‚Äù said a senior officer of ACB on the condition of anonymity. As per data available with ACB, prosecution sanction for 381 cases is pending this year. ‚ÄúThis includes prosecution sanction of some cases that were registered in 2020 too,‚Äù said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/acb-awaits-prosecution-sanctions-in-all-trap-cases-this-year/articleshow/84305736.cms||Ashish Mehta

The plan is to lease out 22 acres to the private partner with the right to mortgage the land which is against the very concept of PPP. As per PPP norms, the private partner should bring in the money required for the project and so the government can shrug off the responsibility of raising funds. But in the case of the proposed waste plant at Brahmapuram, the private partner will be able to mobilize bank loans by mortgaging the corporation‚Äôs land. During the stint of the previous council, the government had demanded the corporation to lease out 22 acres of around 115 acres, which the local body owns at Brahmapuram, to a private firm for setting up a waste-to-energy plant. ‚ÄúThen, both the LDF and UDF councillors had rejected it. But now the government is learnt to have decided to lease out the land to a private firm for setting up the plant. It is using the government‚Äôs special prerogative to use public land for setting up important facilities like waste treatment plant that it leased out the land,‚Äù said Henry Austin, deputy leader, UDF parliamentary party, Kochi corporation. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt understand the need for allowing a private firm to mortgage the corporation‚Äôs land. As per the PPP norms, the private partner should raise the funds on its own. If mortgaging corporation‚Äôs land is required for raising funds for the project, the local body itself or the government can do it. Then, there is no need for a private partner,‚Äù Austin said. According to the corporation authorities, it is the state government which decided to lease out the land. ‚ÄúKochi corporation doesn‚Äôt have any role in implementing the waste-to-energy plant project. We haven‚Äôt supported leasing out the local body‚Äôs land to a private firm,‚Äù said corporation health standing committee chairman T K Asharaf. The file pertaining to the project will come up for the consideration of corporation council soon, it is learnt. Though the government doesn‚Äôt need any approval from the local body, it is for the knowledge of the council that the issue would be presenting there. ‚ÄúWe are still unaware of the terms and conditions of the agreement between the government and the private firm. The government has put the corporation council in the dark. There are allegations that the one of the promoters of the private firm is a relative of an LDF leader. It is to the same firm that the state government awarded the project to biomine legacy waste at Brahmapuram. The Rs 54 crore proposal also doesn‚Äôt have the approval of the corporation council,‚Äù Austin said. Corporation had purchased around 40 acres in Brahmapuram for setting up a solid waste treatment plant in 2005-06. Following the corporation setting up a solid waste treatment plant there, the local residents approached the state government asking it to acquire their holdings also citing stench emanating from the plant. Then, the government took over around 80 acres and handed it over to the corporation. Later, the land owners moved the court seeking additional compensation. The sum the government paid as additional compensation to the land owners is being deducted from the corporation‚Äôs plan fund. So, the land and the plant at Brahmapuram has become a burden for the corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-to-lease-out-land-to-private-firm/articleshow/84303828.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The FIR against the man was filed in January by a woman, now 23, who accused him of raping her as a child since 2013, after expressing his intention to marry her. The high court said the arguments and an August 2020 document between the two show they ‚Äúwere in a close, intimate, emotional and physical relationship but over a period of time it had deteriorated to such an extent that the informant has lodged this FIR against the applicant making serious allegations‚Äù. The FIR alleged the offence continued till last June, when she was a major.Justice Sarang Kotwal, in his order protecting the 24-year-old man, said: ‚ÄúIn this background, only looking at their long consensual relationship, I am inclined to grant order of anticipatory bail ... . At this stage, it is more than clear that both of them were having a serious relationship for a long period of time to the knowledge of their families and friends.‚Äù The man‚Äôs counsel Sana Raees Khan said the FIR registered in January was filed after almost nine years. The FIR was under IPC sections 376 (2) (N) and 377 for continual rape and unnatural offences. Subsequently sections 3 and 4 under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act were added for penetrative sexual assault. It said that since June last year, there had been no physical relation between the two. The high court order noted that in August last year, the man told the woman he wanted to marry another woman and they ‚Äúexecuted a document mentioning their parting of ways‚Äù. He then married the other woman in November and thereafter the FIR of alleged rape on false promise of marriage was filed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-slapped-with-pocso-case-by-ex-gets-pre-arrest-bail/articleshow/84307459.cms||---

Till June 2018, Chanawala government primary school was in dire straits as schools in border areas normally are due to poor upkeep. It was ranked 69th among the 77 primary schools in Fazilka block with shabby infrastructure, broken toilets, poor student strength (less than 150 students were on rolls). It was then that the school got a new headmaster in Lavjeet Singh, who along with other staff members and support from social organisations like Graduates Welfare Association Fazilka (GWAF) started the overhauling with funds provided by the state government or generated from own sources including contributions by the staff. And in less than a year, the face of the school was changed, turning it into first air conditioned campus in April 2019. During this period, the school got digital learning, language laboratory to improve speaking and listening skills of the students in English, Hindi, Punjabi. Chananwala being just near the border lack various basic amenities. The village before the Partition used to be last railway station on Indian side on Fazilka-Samasatta Railway Line (in Bahawalpur district in Pakistan), which was established as a trading route in 1897. Refurbishing of school themed ‚ÄòIndia begins here‚Äô. ‚ÄúAfter complete renovation with Rs 30 lakh, nearly 70% spent through MGNEGA, we felt somewhat relieved, but thought of adding more features and decided the concept of innovation with depicting traditional cultural ethos and put Punjabi culture on display like traditional style rasoi, made a small stadium and an open gym. Now going a step ahead, we have constructed 1,000 sq ft plush air conditioned auditorium with a seating capacity of 75. With it, school has become the first government primary school in Punjab having an own auditorium,‚Äù says Lavjeet Singh, who had got National Award in 2019 and was also selected in iB Hubs Super 30 Inspiring Teachers in September 2019. Before Chananwala, Lavjeet had refurbished government primary school at Dona Nanka village also near the international border. ‚ÄúI took the awards as a challenge to do more and thus came the stadium and auditorium,‚Äù he says, adding now than strength has more than doubled to 324 as students from up to 12 kms and from Fazilka town have taken admission in the school. ‚ÄúWe are delighted to see such an infrastructure at a government school in the border village. We could have never imagined that such an environment could be created for children mostly belonging to poor families,‚Äù said Chananwala resident Joginder Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/language-lab-ac-auditorium-govt-school-on-border-undergoes-complete-makeover/articleshow/84307446.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Mumbai||Owners offer Rs 23k, but Jet Airways' staffers say up to Rs 85L each pending||MUMBAI: Defunct airline Jet Airways owes each of its employees between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 85 lakh as per claims admitted under the insolvency resolution process. The revival plan, submitted by its new owners Kalrock-Jalan, proposes a payment of about Rs 23,000 to each staffer. Under the resolution plan, cleared recently by the National Company Law Tribunal, the payment would be made only if 95% of Jet employees give their acceptance to the plan within the next three months. But, with no word in the NCLT order even on statutory dues like gratuity and with no clarity on their pending dues, employees find themselves in a fix. ‚ÄúJet has asked employees to cast a vote‚Äîyes or no‚Äîto the plan cleared by NCLT, but the plan hardly offers about 0.5% of the sum owed to each employee. It is as good as zero,‚Äù said Kiran Pawaskar of All India Jet Airways Officers and Staff Association. The association sent a letter recently to the new civil aviation minister, labour minister and the regional labour commissioner. ‚ÄúOn preliminary perusal of the resolution plan we found no reference to the claims of the employees. A very paltry amount has been proposed as a resolution in the insolvency and bankruptcy process. The company over its 26 years of existence has a large work force and many of them have worked for long parts of their lives,‚Äù it said. Jet Airways owes an undisputed sum of Rs 15,400 crore to its creditors, out of which Rs 1,254 crore is owed to its workers and employees in the form of unpaid salaries, gratuity etc. A Jet staffer said, ‚ÄúJet owes each commander about Rs 85 lakh and about Rs 3 lakh to the lowest paid employee. The quantum that the workers stand to lose under the resolution plan is shocking.‚Äù The cash payment proposed by Kalrock-Jalan for each worker is a token sum of Rs 11,000 and then Rs 5,100 towards medical reimbursements for workmen‚Äôs parents, Rs 6,200 as reimbursement for workmen‚Äôs children and a one-time mobile recharge of Rs 500. Amit Kelkar of Jet Aircraft Maintenance Engineers Welfare Association has been with Jet for 24 years. ‚ÄúWe and our team of lawyers are studying the NCLT order and other related documents in detail and shall take a decision after carefully considering all aspects,‚Äù he said. Jet Airways had suspended its flights in April 2019. In October last year, Jet Airways committee of creditors approved the revival plan submitted by the Kalrock-Jalan consortium. It proposed to invest Rs 600 crore to repay creditors to acquire about 90% stake in the carrier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/owners-offer-rs-23k-but-jet-staffers-say-up-to-rs-85l-each-pending/articleshow/84307453.cms||---

Saifai Block, which was constituted in 1994, always had a pramukh who was a member or closely associated with the Yadav clan. The 55 BDC members from the Saifai panchayat elect a block chief and out of those 55 all are often BDC members of the Samajwadi Party. For the first time, Ranveer Singh, son of Mulayam‚Äôs eldest brother Ratan Singh, was elected as the head of Saifai block. Ranveer was elected as the block head of Saifai in 2000 again. However, after his sudden demise in 2002, the responsibility of the block head of Saifai in 2003 was given to Dharmendra Yadav, son of Mulayam‚Äôs younger brother Abhayram Yadav. Dharmendra vacated the seat a year later when he was elected as MP from Mainpuri in the 2004 Lok Sabha by-elections as Mulayam vacated the seat after becoming the chief minister in 2003. Thereafter, Mulayam‚Äôs close confidante Nathu Singh‚Äôs nephew Arvind Yadav remained as the block head till the responsibility was passed on to Ranvir‚Äôs son and Mulayam‚Äôs grandson Tej Pratap who became the block pramukh in 2011. He, however, vacated the seat in 2014 after he was elected from the Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat. Thereafter, Tej Pratap‚Äôs mother Mridula Yadav took over at the new pramukh of Saifai block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/msy-bahu-and-lalus-samdhin-elected-block-head-unopposed/articleshow/84303630.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Amritsar||New plant species discovered in Antarctica named after India||BATHINDA: Polar biologists at Central University of Punjab have discovered a new native species of moss from continental Antarctica. The species is named Bryum bharatiensis‚Äì named so as a tribute to the country and India‚Äôs Antarctic station, Bharati. Felix Bast, associate professor and head of the department of Botany, Central University, who was part of Indian Antarctic Mission 2016-17 as an expedition scientist, stumbled upon these green plants on the rocks near Bharati station at Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica. He collected the samples and brought them back to the lab in the university for further work. He performed taxonomic assessments along with his PhD student, Wahid Ul Rahman and collaborator Kriti Gupta, who is heading the Botany department at DAV College, Bathinda. Subsequent studies confirmed it to be a new species of moss discovered for the first time in the world. Besides the discovery of the new species, the study also revealed two new taxonomic records. The moss Bryoerythrophyllum recurvirostrum was recorded for the first time from Larsemann Hills and the moss, Coscinodon lawianus from Schirmacher Oasis- a place near India‚Äôs yet another Antarctic Station, Maitri. Felix used an approach combining morphology-based traditional techniques with DNA sequence-based modern tools for formalising the discovery of the species. Bast said, ‚ÄúThis is the first plant species discovery resulting from 40 years of Indian Antarctic Mission, that began in 1981. India‚Äôs first Antarctic station, Dakshin Gangotri, was established in 1984 but was abandoned and decommissioned in 1990 as the station submerged in an ice sheet. Maitri station was commissioned in 1989 while Bharati station in 2012, both are currently operational and year-round stations. There had been a number of discoveries of bacterial species in Antarctica, but the way species is defined in bacteria is very different from that in plants.‚Äù It has been estimated that the planet earth has 1 trillion species of living organisms, out of which we know merely 1.2 million till date. Discovering new species like this is important not only for characterisation of the Earth‚Äôs biodiversity, but also for economic utilisation by future generations. As naturally occurring living organisms cannot be patented in India, species discoveries like this is an analogous process, he said. The paper describing the discovery has been published in the leading international journal, Journal of Asia-Pacific Biodiversity (Elsevier). This is the sixth species discovery from the research group of Felix Bast, all gthe earlier five were new species of marine seaweeds from Indian coasts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/new-plant-species-discovered-in-antarctica-named-after-india/articleshow/84307455.cms||---

The ACB trapped many public servants in the first six months of this year. With 211 traps, the ACB brought to fore the corrupt practices allegedly by the Baran collector to SDMs in Dausa district among other cases. TOI on Saturday spoke to the authorities to know what led them to have maximum number of traps this year so far compared to 2019 and 2020. ‚ÄúFirst, we have developed a mechanism to make ourselves accessible to everyone. On our helpline, we are getting hundreds of calls everyday to which our officers verify. After complainants directly approach us, we laid traps,‚Äù said B L Soni, director general of ACB. On the number of traps this year so far, he said, ‚ÄúWe have trapped 211 public servants for accepting bribe, including the district collector, Baran, two officers posted as SDMs. Even we had trapped a sub-inspector of Mumbai police, Dausa‚Äôs SP, a deputy superintendent of police posted at ACB Sawai Madhopur, an OSD with JSTSL and many others. In June, we had the highest ever traps which were 67.‚Äù ACB officials stated that in many of these cases, chargesheets have been filed while in some of the cases chargesheets are awaited. ‚ÄúWe have collected proofs in order to ensure that nobody gets bail in corruption cases,‚Äù he added. Also in majority of the cases, the disposal was done on time by the senior officers of the ACB. ‚ÄúIn many cases, my investigating officers approached me to show the evidences they have and other things before going for filing FIRs or further filing chargesheets. In majority of the cases, we have ended the pendency and have completed the disposal of the cases,‚Äù Soni added. Senior officers of the ACB further stated that in some of the cases ACB managed to convert the regular trap cases in Disproportionate Assets cases. ‚ÄúDA cases in Prevention of Corruption Act are very difficult as you need lot of documentary evidences. However, in this year so far we could register 11 DA cases,‚Äù said a senior officer of ACB while quoting the figures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/acb-traps-record-211-tainted-govt-officials-in-6-mths-this-yr/articleshow/84305722.cms||Ashish Mehta

The accused was on the run since May 2018 after being released on 15-day parole to attend his sister‚Äôs marriage. While on the run, he attacked rival gang with guns and bombs in Ganjam district of Odisha. Police arrested Dilip alias Mittu Pradhan, 32, from an apartment in SMC Awas in Pandesara. The accused was hiding there without disclosing his actual identity. But police received information that he is a wanted criminal in Odisha. Pradhan was resting at home when police nabbed him and brought him to the crime branch for questioning. His photos were shared with Odisha police and they confirmed that Pradhan operates his gang in the state. Police said that Pradhan entered the world of crime at the age of 15 and has been arrested in 29 cases of assault, using firearms, throwing bombs, robbery among others. He was last arrested in October 2017 and was in jail till May 2018 when he got parole. He did not return to jail after the bail period was over. While on the run he was involved in firing on the rival gang and throwing a bomb. He was booked in five offences since his release on parole. To stay out of police reach, Pradhan escaped from Odisha and shifted to Hyderabad, Chennai, Mumbai, Pune and Rajasthan before reaching the city. ‚ÄúHe arrived in the city seven days ago. He took shelter at the apartment of a worker who was a friend of his friend,‚Äù said a police officer.

SAD MLA Bikram Singh Majithia said Punjab was in the midst of a power crisis with power to farmers, industry, traders and the common man being severely curtailed. He said in the midst of this power emergency, Kejriwal had moved the Supreme Court to close the thermal plants of Punjab. ‚ÄúAll this is part of a conspiracy. It is clear that AAP wants the power situation in Punjab to worsen, so that it can then descend on the state and play politics on this issue,‚Äù he said. Terming such politics as reprehensible, Majithia said if Kejriwal had any conscience, he would have thought hundred times before pursuing a line which would devastate Punjab‚Äôs farm economy and endanger food requirements of the country. He said had he petition succeeded, it would have wiped out the state‚Äôs industry besides making trade unviable. Majithia said this was not the first time that Kejriwal had pursued an anti-Punjab agenda even though he put on a pro-Punjab mask whenever he visited the state. He said earlier in the case of the Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue, Kejriwal had advocated that the canal should not be built while visiting Punjab, but had gone back to Delhi and filed an affidavit in court saying Delhi and Haryana also had right to SYL water and that the canal should be built.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-hits-out-at-kejriwal-over-pil-for-closure-of-thermal-plants-in-punjab/articleshow/84307457.cms||---

He also took on the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) over the power purchase agreements (PPAs). In a break from his previous tweets, Sidhu made no caustic remark about chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, fuelling speculations of a possible truce in the verbal war. Sidhu reserved his second round for volleys for the opposition parties, tweeting: "The Delhi state govt wants Punjab‚Äôs lifeline, our thermal-energy plants, shut down in the middle of a power crisis, to leave the Punjabis helpless in this simmering heat and to let our farmers suffer in this paddy-sowing season." He added, "The Badals signed those 25-year PPAs with the plants when (Bikram Singh) Majithia was renewable energy minister (2015-17). They sold solar energy for Rs 5.97 to 17.91 per unit to loot Punjab, when this cost was decreasing 18% a year since 2010 and is Rs 1.99 today." Outages and voltage fluctuations are frequent in both urban and rural Punjab. Meanwhile, the Congress is trying to make peace between Amarinder and Sidhu to look united before the coming assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/badals-cut-power-kejri-tried-to-pull-plug-sidhu/articleshow/84307460.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‚ÄòSex abuse‚Äô at work: Bombay HC tells woman to move industrial court||MUMBAI: In a complaint of sexual harassment at workplace, the Bombay high court has directed a woman to file an appeal before the industrial court in Mumbai against a March 2020 POSH committee order dismissing her allegations against an executive she used to report to in a large corporate. In March, for the first time, the state had notified industrial courts as an appellate body under the Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act (POSH), 2013, for those not satisfied with recommendations of the internal panel. The HC said the relevance of the notification was that the industrial court would be the appellate authority under the POSH Act. The HC bench of Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Madhav Jamdar, in a July 8 decision, said the woman can seek remedy by filing an appeal against the internal committee (IC) report and order. Under the POSH Act, a complaint is first assessed by an in-house panel which also has a member from an NGO. The woman approached the HC last year with a grievance that since the in-house panel informed her ‚Äúno action was required‚Äù on her complaint alleging sexual harassment, thereby dismissing it, she had nowhere to turn to. Her counsel, Mihir Desai, said there was no appellate body set up or notified by the state under the POSH Act or rules and hence she was constrained to approach the HC against the company to quash the IC‚Äôs report and order. She also questioned her subsequent ‚Äúillegal termination‚Äù in June 2020. The company, represented by counsel Birendra Saraf, opposed her petition and also questioned its maintainability given the provisions of the Act. At a hearing on March 11, the state had said the POSH Act, under Section 18 and Rule 11, provides for appeals against the IC report. The HC had directed the state to give details of whether such an appellate authority was set up. On July 8, the state‚Äôs assistant government pleader Hemant Haryan informed the HC of its March 31 notification. It made the industrial court in Mumbai the appellate authority in this case. The notification was issued by the state deputy secretary (industries, energy and labour departments) under Section 2 (A) of the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946, in supersession of the earlier notifications. The POSH Act‚Äôs Section 18 says any person aggrieved from recommendations made under Section 13 (2) (i) or (ii) or sections 14 and 17 or non-implementation of such recommendations may file an appeal to a tribunal within 90 days. The HC bench said ‚Äúit would be open‚Äô‚Äô to the woman seeking condonation of the delay and the tribunal then may consider the time spent in pursuing the petition before the HC as well as the prevailing pandemic. It did not pass orders on maintainability of her petition or merit and kept all such contentions open.

The boy fell victim to the trap laid by the suspects and ended up transferring the amount to the suspects from his father‚Äôs bank account. Based on a complaint lodged by the boy‚Äôs mother, an offence has been registered with Cidco police station against unidentified suspects. They have been booked on charges of cheating and criminal breach of trust. In addition to this, suspects have also been slapped with sections of the Information and Technology Act. Citing contents of the complaint received on Thursday, police said the boy fell prey to an advertisement he came across on social media. The advertisement was on providing work from home opportunities. After he contacted the given number, he was asked to pay a sum of Rs 999 for enrolment. This was followed by the suspects making the boy deposit Rs 5,000 as a security deposit and on two more occasions, Rs 25,000 and Rs 40,000 were collected from the teenager. After the teenager did not get any online work from the suspects, they again made him deposit Rs 80, 000. Each time the suspects assured him that all the amount being transferred to their accounts will be kept as a deposit and will be returned once in for all. After his father found that about Rs 1.60 lakh has been transferred, he realised that his son has been duped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/policemans-minor-son-duped-of-rs-1-6l/articleshow/84300333.cms||‡§ü‡§æ‡§á‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º ‡§®‡•á‡§ü‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï

An emotional moment...‚Äù said Union external affairs minister S Jaishankar. MEA S Jaishankar hands over the relics to his Georgian counterpart David ZalkalianiThe Indian government has gifted one part of the right arm bone relic to the Georgian government, while the other part continues to be in the custody of the ASI museum in Old Goa. A replica of the relics excavated are on display at the museum. At the request of the Georgian government, the relics were sent for an exhibition in 2017, and then returned to India. Ketevan, who was canonised and is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, is considered a martyr in her native land, and Georgians have been anticipating the arrival of her relics. They now reach Georgia more than four centuries after they were hidden and transported ‚Äî from Iran, where she was killed, by Augustinian friars ‚Äî to Old Goa, and placed in a sarcophagus (a stone coffin) in Old Goa. ASI‚Äôs excavations at the complex lasted over a decade. When contacted, former ASI director N Taher, who led the team that uncovered the relics at the time, said it is a homecoming of sorts for the saint. ‚ÄúFor those who believe in divinity, the saint herself wanted to be exhumed for the second time by our archaeological team (of ASI) to travel back to her homeland as a gift from the people of India,‚Äù he said. Back when the relics were unearthed, the paradox was that the team was not searching for the bone relics, but for the place where the relics were kept. ‚ÄúThen, when we found the remains, we worked in reverse order to prove the bone found was that of the mother saint of Georgia. It was like a jigsaw puzzle, and all the teams associated with it tried to piece it together from their perspective and‚Ä¶ we had the right combination to open the lock,‚Äù he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/relic-of-georgian-martyr-ketevan-reaches-home/articleshow/84305881.cms||Lisa Monteiro

The dilapidated market is to be redeveloped. There are 157 licensed fisherwomen who have set up stalls in the basement of the market. The BMC on Friday issued a 48-hour notice to all stall owners in the market to vacate the premises as they have been provided alternate sites. It further said if they do not shift to the alternatives provided, they will have to stop their business completely at least for a month. The BMC notice further informs no one will be allowed entry into the market from Tuesday. The women alleged the BMC is discriminating against them by telling them to shift to Airoli, Mulund, Andheri, Borivali and Dahisar. ‚ÄúI have been selling fish here for the past 45 years and my sister for 60 years. Now they (the BMC) want us to go to Andheri and Borivali and set up stalls there. Is that possible?‚Äù asked Sadhna Koli.  ‚ÄúThe BMC says it is only for one month and 15 days and then they will shift us back but how can they put us through such difficulties?‚Äù asked Anjana Koli. Devendra Tandel, president, Akhil Maharashtra Machchimar Kruti Samiti, said the BMC has made provisions for the 150 licensed meat sellers at the CST market to be accommodated in the adjoining parking lot. ‚ÄúThis is sheer discrimination. Why must the fisherwomen travel so far? There is a ban on travel by local trains,‚Äù he said. The women have decided to stay put after closing hours on Sunday and will not move out unless they are accommodated in the parking lot with others. The BMC notice has assured the fisherwomen that once the market is redeveloped the stalls will be restored to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fisherwomen-to-stay-put-in-cst-market-to-protest-shifting-of-stalls/articleshow/84303857.cms||Clara Lewis

Apart from gifting the 60 ventilators to the government, it is giving out 60 more to charity hospitals. The remaining 40 ventilators will be given to private hospitals on the condition that patients requiring ventilator support will not be charged. Justice Chittatosh Mookerjee, former chief justice of Bombay High Court who leads the Bangla Worldwide, said a committee had been formed with physicians Sukumar Mukherjee, Ashokananda Konar, Shibaji Basu and Red Cross secretary Syed Nasiruddin for transparent distribution of the ventilators. ‚ÄúApplications were sought from NGOs and their credentials are being checked before the critical devices are handed over to aid treatment,‚Äù Justice Mookerjee said.  Mukherjee said AAPI secretary Amit Chakraborty had assured the NGO that more such ventilators would be sent to Bengal. The portable ventilators are handy for use in ambulances to help resuscitate a patient while being transported to hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/indian-docs-in-us-donate-160-ventilators-to-bengal/articleshow/84303875.cms||---

The incident took place during counting of votes for block chief elections in Sikandrarao. According to police, when the process of initiating lottery system for selection of the candidate was on, after both candidates ‚Äî Ajay Pratap Jadon from BJP and Sudama Devi from SP ‚Äì received 39 votes each, supporters of SP candidate‚Äôs created a ruckus outside and pelted stones on police when they were stopped from entering the complex. Hathras superintendent of police Vineet Jaiswal said that mild force was used to disperse the mob and 40 people have been arrested from the spot. An FIR is being registered and strict action will be taken against them. Jaiswal further said that SP candidate Sudama Devi‚Äôs son Devendra Yadav was also injured in stone-pelting by their party workers but they were alleging that he had been shot at by his opponents. ‚ÄúBoth party workers were standing almost 500 metres away from each other, separated by barricading,‚Äù he said.

---||Amritsar||Punjab: Kotkapura former SHO backs narco test on ex-IG Kunwar||BATHINDA: Punjab Police suspended sub-inspector Gurdeep Singh Pandhar, who was the SHO of Kotkapura City police station when the Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan police firing incidents took place in October 2015, on Saturday backed suspended inspector general of police (IG) Paramraj Singh Umranangal‚Äôs demand for a narco analysis on former IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who was a key member of the previous SIT which probed the firing incidents and Bargari sacrilege case. Pandher did not stress on conducting the test on the former IG, but said it would bring out the truth. He said he was willing to undergo a narco analysis on any number of occasions in both Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan firing incidents. The new SIT probing the Kotkapura case, and headed by ADGP L K Yadav, has not demanded a narco test on Pandher, but the suspended cop said he was ready for anything to ensure a fair investigation. Pandher claimed that he had never been to Behbal Kalan and was falsely implicated in the case related to the police firing which took place there. Pandher was the SHO of Kotkapura City police station on October 14, 2015, when police had used water canons, teargas and even resorted to gunfire to disperse people protesting over the sacrilege of a Bir of Guru Granth Sahib. The previous SIT had accused Pandher of fabricating evidence by misappropriating 10 cartridges shown to have been used and the used empties deposited by him in the police malkhana (record room). He is also accused of tampering with the record of police station pertaining to the case. He had then, along with head constable Rashpal Singh, filed a petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court, following which the investigations into Kotkapura case by previous SIT was quashed. He was named in the Behbal Kalan case on July 14, 2020. His petition in the case is pending before high court. Its hearing has been fixed for September 2. Pandher said the new SIT had called him for questioning and he had cooperated with it. ‚ÄúI was made an accused by the previous SIT in the Kotkapura case because of I was the SHO of Kotkapura City police station at the time of the time. However, I have never been to Behbal Kalan. There were a number of senior police officers present at Kotkapura before and after the clash with protesters on the morning of October 14, 2015. For being the SHO, I was duty-bound to take care of everything and also to take injured people to hospital. I was with preachers Panthpreet Singh, Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale and more at Kotkapura, then how could I be present at Behbal Kalan, which falls under Bajakhana police station and is out of my jurisdiction, only few hours after the Kotkapura incident. I had written an application while being in Bathinda jail through jail officials to DGP on July 13, 2020, for justice, but I was nominated in the Behbal Kalan case on July 14, 2020,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/kotkapura-ex-sho-backs-lie-test-on-ex-ig-kunwar-vijay/articleshow/84307464.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Mumbai||FDs to tabs, Mumbai reaches out to pandemic-hit kids||MUMBAI: Your city does have a heart. A week after TOI published a series of stories of children from needy families affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, a host of organizations and individuals have come forward to make their lives a tad easier. While some individuals brought out their wallets, with a rider that their identities not be revealed, a few organizations have gone all out to ensure that the children do not stop their online schooling. Project Mumbai, a city-based non-profit, will create fixed deposits in the names of each of the six children whose stories were reported in TOI, with a lock-in till they turn 18, said its founder and chief executive officer Shishir Joshi. They will also be given cellphones or tabs, where need exists, with internet data and the school curriculum uploaded. The NGO, which bagged the UN award for Covid relief work last year, plays a catalyst in its mission to help the needy, especially children, by calling for help from willing citizens. ‚ÄúChildren from needy families are the worst hit in these times. Nearly 12,000 children across Maharashtra alone have lost at least one parent. Of these, over 400 have lost both parents,‚Äù Joshi said, adding the overall situation impacts a child psychologically too. GiveIndia has rolled out a fundraiser called ‚ÄòTeam for Humanity‚Äô to help bring in donations for families that have lost the breadwinner. The fundraiser event, which stretches over six months, has individuals as well as celebrities chipping in for the cause. ‚ÄúThe families featured in TOI will be offered a one-time amount of Rs 30,000 each,‚Äù a spokesperson for GiveIndia said, adding donors can get details online. Dharavi alone has thousands of children wanting to resume school. To help them pick up their books again, Centre for Transforming India, or CFTI, has launched a special initiative titled ‚ÄòSchool on Tab‚Äô to make available 1,000 digital kits with connectivity. Early this month, the first batch of 50 children was handed a tab each, said Sapna Kar, project advisor for the initiative that aims to bridge the digital divide for children who live in the slums. ‚ÄúAnother 100 kids will be given tabs in the next batch. Each child gets a brand new tab with 1GB storage,‚Äù Kar said, adding that another 700 children are still in need of tabs. ‚ÄúThe tabs are not at all conducive for gaming so that the gadgets are used for the intended purpose of schooling.‚Äù The city seems to have come together to ensure that the pandemic does not push children into statistical figures of ‚Äòschool dropouts‚Äô or, worse still, that dark dungeon of child labour. https://fundraisers.giveindia.org/fundraisers/team-for-humanityhttps://projectmumbai.org/||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fds-to-tabs-city-reaches-out-to-pandemic-hit-kids/articleshow/84305913.cms||---

With bare necessities, Sarkar set out on the long road from Chandigarh on Friday to pedal across Simla-Manali-Leh and finally Ladakh to spread the ‚ÄòSave Trees Save Water‚Äô message. So what prompted her to take up the tour? ‚ÄúOver the last one year, I have seen, how the price of an oxygen cylinder has gone up. People died due to scarcity of oxygen in hospitals. Considering the situation, people should be more cautious about keeping the environment pollution free. For that they need to plant more trees and save the existing ones,‚Äù Sarkar said. This isn‚Äôt her first tour. Sarkar had travelled to Bhutan alone in 2019 for the same cause. The nature lover was also part of a tour to Kaziranga for the ‚ÄòSave the one-horned Rhinos‚Äô project. The 32-year-old is also a single mother and her nine-year-old son is her biggest strength. ‚ÄúI have a wedding photography business but that is only to help me and my son survive since my separation. Cycling is my passion and my son is my biggest motivator. I will be leaving him with his grandmother while on the trip,‚Äù Sarkar added. She informed that it was because of her friends that she could get ready for the tour. ‚ÄúThis tour is partly self financed. Rest of the funds have been sent by my friends. Others have packed dry food items for the trip. One of them even made a mobile powerbank for me,‚Äù she said. The road is not an easy one, but Sarkar is determined to conquer the shifting landscapes. ‚ÄúI am carrying a tent with me so that I can save on hotel cost. It is a tough journey but I think I owe it to mother nature,‚Äù she added. However, Sarkar is not sure of the length of her tour. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to restrict myself to a particular time frame. On my return trip, I have plans to travel via Jammu & Kashmir and Kedarnath. I might use the cycle throughout the return journey as well,‚Äù she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-woman-pedals-through-valleys-to-spread-save-greenery-msg/articleshow/84303911.cms||---

Kunte said representatives of various industries should discuss the matter with their respective district disaster management authorities (DDMA). ‚ÄúThe basic outline has been drawn by the state, but the local authorities should incorporate protocols, depending on the local situation,‚Äù Kunte told TOI. ‚ÄúStaggered timings for operations or bio-bubbles, which minimize the risk of Covid infection, should be adopted by the industries. This should be the base of the plan. Collectors or DDMAs understand the local conditions better and they should draw up a plan following state-level guidelines,‚Äù said Kunte, adding the collectors would have to talk to the respective industry heads to chalk out the final plan. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in a meeting conducted recently, had directed district collectors to chart out a plan to ensure industries could operate amid a possible third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. The chief secretary said the existing Covid-induced regulations would be discussed in the next review meeting. ‚ÄúAny further decisions would be taken after the assessment of data related to Covid and consultation with the task force,‚Äù he said.

With this decision, Aurangabad city has become the first police unit in the state to take such an initiative in the larger interest of the society. Gupta told TOI, ‚ÄúWe are dealing with a civilian society and there is no scope of using unwanted force while dealing with them. Imposition of lockdown due to the pandemic situation is a social and health issue, so there is no cause to hit anyone caught violating norms.‚Äù The officer said holding the batons while being on regular checking or nakabandi gives an impression that the police are there to use force against the commuters or public at large. ‚ÄúWe have asked the personnel to keep the batons in the tents or the police vehicles. They should be withdrawn, when using force remains the only option,‚Äù he said. A senior officer said earlier this week, a man going to a blood bank on his bike to get a blood bag for his relative panicked when the police personnel at Mukundwadi tried to stop him. This led to the man losing the balance of his bike and ending up with injuries. Taking cognizance of the incident, the police constable was immediately transferred to the police control room. Though this decision has not gone down well with a section of lower rung police personnel, senior officials have vehemently advocated for the strict implementation of the orders citing that it will not only boost the public‚Äôs confidence in the police but will also make them more comfortable in interacting with the police personnel deployed at the checkpoints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-police-chief-do-not-carry-baton-at-checkposts/articleshow/84300403.cms||---

All the municipalities will be coming in this category. If they take the authorization of the board, then only we can certify and state that they are treating it scientifically based on the 2016 Waste Management Act,‚Äù said a PCB official. He said that this could solve many future issues because the plant will then be set up according to law and rules. The state level monitoring committee (SLMC) had given strict directions to local bodies of Ernakulam following which the preliminary steps like household level segregation, door to door collection by Haritha Karma Sena etc began. ‚ÄúBut the scientific management of the solid waste still seems to be a herculean task as the common facilities provided by some local bodies are found to be just ‚Äòdumpsites‚Äô only,‚Äù according to the report submitted by the PCB to the green bench hearing the batch of petitions on waste management at Brahmapuram.

---||Kochi||Eight died of mucormycosis in Ernakulam in two months||KOCHI: Ernakulam witnessed eight deaths due to mucormycosis infection in the past two months. The district reported total 16 mucormycosis cases after the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic last year. Six deaths happened in May and the rest in June. Of the deceased, one is a 40-year-old male. Males constitute highest number of patients in the reported 16 cases with 11 and the rest five are females. Of the eight deaths, two were non-Covid cases. Doctors say the fatality rate of the invasive fungal infection in immunocompromised patients is 60-70%. However, of the 1,317 declared Covid deaths in the district till July 4, 214 patients had no comorbidities. Authorities expect the current situation in the district to continue for next three to four weeks. ‚ÄúComorbidity is only an add-on factor contributing to the fatality caused by Covid. But that does not mean that only those with comorbidity die of Covid. Each body responds to the infection differently. With the increase in testing, there is five per cent increase in cases last week compared to the previous week. Restrictions should be strengthened to curb the spread of the infection,‚Äù said a health official. Meanwhile, around 40% of the population in Ernakulam have been vaccinated with first dose so far. A surveillance report submitted to the district administration on July 4 shows that 9,301 persons who got the first dose contracted the disease. As many as 444 people who took both the doses were also infected with Covid-19 so far. But the report admits that the existing testing pattern of the health department will not help bring down test positivity rate (TPR) to less than five per cent. It has been noted that number of primary contacts is very low as many people are not coming forward fearing they will have to undergo quarantine if tested positive for Covid. Missing cases will continue to spread infection in the community. TPR of Ernakulam is hovering between eight and 10 per cent for the past few weeks. When it comes to moving average of TPR, more number of local bodies are falling in Category D, calling for triple lockdown. ‚ÄúICU admissions are coming down in hospitals. ICU beds remain vacant in many hospitals. The district is witnessing a plateauing situation. One school of thought is that plateauing may help prevent the third wave,‚Äù said IMA (Ernakulam chapter) former president Dr Junaid Rehman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/8-died-of-mucormycosis-in-district-in-two-months/articleshow/84303973.cms||---

We have been promised more doses on Monday and plan to restart the vaccination drive in a big way on that day,‚Äô‚Äô said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. There will be no free vaccination drive on Sunday in Mumbai. Among the people who got vaccinated in Mumbai on Saturday, 72 got the jab at state government centres and 28,717 beneficiaries were in the 18-44 age group. Mumbai now has 47.35 lakh people who have got at least the first jab; 12.73 lakh people are fully vaccinated so far. Overall vaccination in the state picked up on Saturday. Across the state, 3.64 lakh people got vaccinated on Saturday‚Äîa sizeable increase against the turnout of 1.97 lakh on Friday, when there was a shortage of vaccines. On Monday, pregnant women can get vaccinated at any BMC-run centre. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want pregnant women travelling far from their home for the vaccine. We have decided to allow vaccination at most of our centres,‚Äù Kakani said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-bmc-drive-but-pvt-efforts-take-city-past-60-lakh-doses/articleshow/84305966.cms||---

The pow-wow was over the state government's recent announcement to provide 100 units of free electricity for domestic consumers. In a tweet on Saturday, Kejriwal said, ‚ÄúUttarakhand generates electricity and sells it to other states. Then why is electricity so expensive for the people of Uttarakhand? Delhi does not generate its own electricity, buys it from other states and yet, electricity is free in Delhi. Shouldn't the people of Uttarakhand get free electricity?.‚Äù On being asked about Kejriwal‚Äôs tweet, CM Dhami said, ‚ÄúHe (Arvind Kejriwal) may have an agenda for the 2022 election but for the BJP, the focus is on working for the people. We are not working for any polls and our sole agenda is the development of the state.‚Äù Earlier on Thursday, power minister Harak Singh Rawat had announced free power supply to domestic consumers using 100 units or less per month. Besides, senior Congress leader Harish Rawat uploaded a post on his Facebook wall, saying, ‚ÄúWhy only 100 units? If the 'double engine government' had the will, it could have extended 200 units of free power supply... The announcement needs to be implemented with immediate effect.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-cm-dhami-delhi-cm-kejriwal-trade-barbs-over-free-power-supply/articleshow/84302341.cms||Kautilya Singh

The Congress members expressed annoyance over rising inflation, alleged fake Covid testing scam, farmers' issues, crime against women, and unemployment. Hundreds of party members, led by Singh, marched towards the CM residence. The police at Hathibarkala tried to stop the protests, which led to a minor clash between the two sides. In the scuffle, the party's state chief Pritam Singh sustained minor injuries. Singh said, ‚ÄúThe BJP's term in office has proved to be a complete failure. After the Kumbh disaster, they are planning to hold the Kanwar Yatra, which is likely to increase the number of Covid-19 cases. They were least bothered about the second wave and are not concerned about the predicted third wave.‚Äù The senior Congress member asserted that despite having 57 MLAs in the 70-member House, ‚Äúthe state government has failed to take decisions in favour of the people.‚Äù In a similar vein, Congress state vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana pointed out that unemployment is at an all-time high in the state. ‚ÄúWhen into the election year, the government is announcing jobs, and everyone knows that the recruitment is unlikely before the polls. They are simply trying to mislead the people by making fake promises,‚Äù he said. The leader added, ‚ÄúNow, a minister has announced 100 units of free electricity to domestic consumers. Was the government sleeping for the last four years? People of Uttarakhand are well versed with reality and will give a befitting reply to the people making fake promises.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cong-stages-massive-protest-against-ukhand-govt-partys-state-chief-suffers-minor-injuries/articleshow/84302385.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Nagpur||‚ÄòResearch in forensic science shall help both varsity & investigations‚Äô||The Government Institute of Forensic Science (IFS) got its first doctorate of philosophy (PhD) holders in assistant professors Ashish Badiye and Neeti Kapoor. Badiye, who is head of the forensic science department, was one of the founding faculty members when the IFS started from the makeshift campus at Government Institute of Science in 2011. Kapoor joined a year later and together the husband-wife duo have authored several research works published in reputed journals like Elsevier, Taylor and Francis, Springer, SAGE, Nature, etc. Their expertise is often sought by investigating authorities to help crack complex crimes. Started in 2017, the PhDs, under the guidance of Swati Dubey Mishra, was recently awarded by Shri Vaishnav Vidyapeeth Vishwavidyalaya (SVVV), Indore, Madhya Pradesh. They are probably the first researchers in the field of forensic science from the Nagpur University. Their feat marks the beginning of research and development in this stream, which is still in the process of setting up its first forensic science research centre. The teacher-couple spoke to TOI about the importance of research and the advantage of their latest techniques derived during the PhD in related investigations. Excerpts...  Q. In what way will the university gain from your achievement? A. Neeti Kapoor: The Government Institute of Forensic Science is the first in India to be ranked in 101-150 band in the prestigious NIRF2020 ranking. Now, having a Phd would help us speed up starting the first-ever research centre in Vidarbha under Nagpur University. We would be able to apply to various funding agencies and carry out important and path-breaking research projects. Meritorious students would greatly benefit. This would ensure qualified students cracking JRF and NET in forensics don‚Äôt have to go outside Nagpur for their PhDs. Research done from Nagpur would highlight the city on the research map of the world. Ashish Badiye: We as doctoral candidates had to juggle between roles and cities to complete our PhD. This is a significant challenge for students of forensic science who may decide to switch fields if they are unable to cope with the challenges. Many students have cleared NET and JRF from our institute. They have to apply to other institutes/universities offering doctoral programmes in other cities. Some have even ended up losing their JRF since they were not able to secure a seat. I hope that our achievement marks the beginning of a new chapter wherein deserving students would be able to sustain their education from the city itself. There are renowned institutions coming up or have already set up base in Nagpur so there would be ample opportunities for collaborative research works as well. Q. What was your PhD topic all about? A. NK: My study was related to determination of hand by single-digit fingerprint. There are limited studies that deal with this wherein the researchers used only a particular pattern and a few parameters for the determination of hand. A total of 2,900 fingerprints were analysed. Twenty-eight parameters were studied in ten types of fingerprints. This study confirms the findings of the earlier studies and adds novel parameters for the determination of hand from a single fingerprint. This would be of particular help to the investigators and fingerprint examiners. Q. How does it make an investigator‚Äôs job easier? A. NK: On the crime scenes, a complete set of the ten-digit fingerprints is hardly ever encountered. Determination of hand is essential to reduce the onus of the investigator and may thereby make possible the identification of the contributor. The single finger impressions are of diverse importance. They are even used in place of signature in India in several vital documents like property, agreement to sell, validated (notarized) documents, registries, bank documents, loan documents, cheques, cash withdrawal and deposit slips, competitive examination forms, attendance sheets, among others. Assessment of hand, either right or left, is one of the most vital constraints to ascertain. In the scene of occurrence, fingerprints are not encountered in a sequence. Fingerprints usually come across in a random sequence or maybe a single fingerprint received from the scene of the crime. In such case(s), the determination hand of a print is significant to determine or scrutinise the suspect. If an examiner establishes the hand, i.e., the prints belong to the right hand or left hand, it will reduce the time of investigation by further minimising the pool of suspects. Q. And what about your study? A. AB: My PhD focused on assessment of handprint to determine the sex and height. The human handprint contains a wide assortment of measurable topographies and physiognomies (physical characteristics) like the shape of the handprint, the handprint-geometry, the dermatoglyphics (skin friction ridges) patterns, and various other features. The combination of these features proves helpful in personal identification as well as identity verification. Generally, ‚Äòhandprint‚Äô is a term used synonymously with ‚Äòpalmprint‚Äô. However, it must be noted that the ‚Äòpalmprint‚Äô comprises of the print of the inner surface of the hand between the fingers and wrist while the ‚Äòhandprint‚Äô encompasses the palmprint, the digit prints (the prints of the four fingers between the first and third phalanx), the thumbprint (the print of the thumb between first and second phalanx) and the fingerprints (the prints of four fingertips and thumb tip). Q. Will this help reduce the suspect pool? A. AB: The combination of features present on the handprints, palmprints and fingerprints are unique and permanent and serve as crucial means of identification. The dimensions and characteristics present on the hand and palm are found useful for sex determination and stature estimation. Sex determination has always been a challenging task for an investigating officer. Investigators often come across the complete or incomplete palmprints and handprints along with fingerprints at the crime scene. Various dermatoglyphic characteristics present on the palm would be helpful to determine the sex of the donor, which ultimately helps the investigator to narrow down the suspect pool to almost half. Once the sex is determined, appropriate formulae may be applied for the estimation of stature, reducing the suspect pool further. A total of 1,016 bilateral handprints were analysed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/research-in-forensic-science-shall-help-both-varsity-investigations/articleshow/84304009.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

With the new round, the startup, founded by Kanishka Patel, is now valued at Rs 5 crore. Two investors, a Faridabad-based firm, Victora Group (invested an estimated Rs 1 crore) along with Gujarat University Startup and Entrepreneurship Council (GUSEC ‚Äì with a funding of Rs 25 lakh) have invested in the startup. The startup, incubated at GUSEC, plans to go aggressive in its marketing campaigns with the fresh round of funding to help boost sales. ‚ÄúCurrently, we are present in at least 35 cities including major tier-I cities and a few tier-II cities as well. These include Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot, Bengaluru, Gurgaon, Mumbai and Tamil Nadu, among others. Going forward, we plan to expand to other Indian cities as well,‚Äù said Patel. ‚ÄúThat apart, we are also looking at getting incorporated in the US and Canada this month,‚Äù he further said. The startup, which is a recipient of Atal Innovation Medal of Year 2020, is all set to collaborate with multibrand electronic retail chains for experiencing the products. WeHear was founded in 2017, when Patel was on the verge of completing his graduation in electronics engineering from LD Engineering College in Ahmedabad. ‚ÄúI began research at an early stage and it took me two years to develop the product. We first developed a hearing care device ‚Äì which are earphones that operate using bone conduction technology. This means the sounds bypass one‚Äôs physical ears and cause less damage. The earphones are linked with a mobile app which has many functions including language translation,‚Äù explained Patel. The hearing aid developed by WeHear works on a similar principle. ‚ÄúThe sound waves are sent to the brain in the form of signals after bypassing the physical ears and instead directly sends signals to the brain, thus helping speech and hearing-impaired persons to hear with more ease. Moreover, the language translation which is available through the mobile application also enables them to hear a foreign language, as the app has translation options available for some 72 languages,‚Äù Patel said. At present, the products are being retailed by partnering with a couple of leading e-commerce platforms and also by partnering with government agencies and nongovernment organizations (NGOs). Recently the start-up‚Äôs products have been selected and certified by the department of health and family welfare, government of Gujarat. A committee was formed to evaluate the products, which will be made available on gover nment platforms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-firm-making-hearing-aids-raises-1-25cr/articleshow/84306013.cms||Niyati Parikh

Crime branch officials said Irfan had an illicit relationship with the woman, Rekha Jayesh, for over 15 years. She recently entered a relationship with another person. On Tuesday, Khokhra police found the body hidden in a moulded polythene water tank on the third floor of a garment factory. The postmortem revealed the woman had been stabbed to death. She was later identified and found to be a resident of Amraiwadi. Khan lived in the same neighbourhood as her. Crime branch officials said the investigation was under way when they received information that Khan was at a tea stall in Amraiwadi and he was involved in the murder at Khokhra. He was nabbed and on interrogation, confessed to having murdered Rekha. Rekha was married and had children. She and Khan had been in a relationship for over 15 years. Khan told police that he trusted Rekha and had given her Rs 2 lakh in 2019, which she used up. He had also recently learned that she was in a relationship with another person. This angered him and he murdered her after heated arguments. Crime branch officials said on Sunday Khan had called Rekha to meet him and the two had an argument after which he strangled and then stabbed her. He then dumped the body in the water tank, which was full. Police said as he knew her family would call her, Khan took both of Rekha‚Äôs mobiles. After his arrest, investigators recovered both phones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/water-tank-murder-lover-nabbed/articleshow/84303982.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Substance abuse on the rise among teens amid pandemic||HYDERABAD: For 13-year-old Sirisha (name changed on request), chancing upon an unattended whisky bottle at home during the second wave turned out to be a huge temptation to try her hands on the liquor. The chance discovery soon turned into an obsession and she had even stolen money and bribed her maid to get her some liquor over the last four months. She is now under therapy after her parents caught her stealing money from home. Meanwhile, parents of a 17-year-old adolescent student were alarmed by repeated incidents of anger outbursts, irritability, sleep disturbances and reduced motivation and rushed him to a psychiatrist. The teen disclosed the impact of the pandemic on his life, how he had reduced concentration and other mental health issues and was now a regular consumer of cannabis, usually sourcing it from pan shops. ‚ÄúOn history and interview, he spoke about how the pandemic has restricted him from going for his basketball coaching and swimming and how he is not able to meet his friends like before. He even spoke about loneliness which attracted him towards regular use of cannabis. In the last 6 months, 20 to 30% of adolescents in my practice have been diagnosed with an underlying depressive disorder and substance abuse,‚Äù said Dr Virinchi Sharma, consultant psychiatrist and director of Manasa Hospital, adding that kids have admitted to getting access to cannabis for as little as Rs 50 to Rs 70. Like these two adolescents, many more younger citizens have borne the brunt of the pandemic-induced restrictions in life and have turned to experimenting and substance abuse. Substance abuse among the kids in the age group of 12 to 18 years has, meanwhile, doubled during the recent months, say experts and atleast 5 to 6 hospital admissions are being reported in a month among these kids. ‚ÄúBoredom, depression and sudden loss of all childhood-related activities and structured school life have pushed many to experiment with cannabis and alcohol. Substance abuse is being seen in children who are able to go out or have access to something, like alcohol availability in the house. Also, the fact that a lot of information gets exchanged among peers could work as a tempting factor. There is huge increase in substance abuse and it is being seen across social strata,‚Äù said Dr Vasuprada Karthik, a psychologist who works with government agencies like Bharosa and SheTeams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/substance-abuse-on-the-rise-among-teens-amid-pandemic/articleshow/84306060.cms||Amrita Didyala

As the monsoon is expected to intensify in the coming weeks, residents say that they are yet to recover from the impact which was created by last year‚Äôs deluge. Many families slammed elected representatives and government authorities for inaction since the past one year. A 60-year-old resident of Osman Nagar, Syed Waheed Rahman said, ‚ÄúAfter our house was flooded with nearly 10 feet of rainwater last year, we were forced to leave and look for a rented place near Pahadi Shareef. For about four months, I used to travel 5 to 6 km to check on my submerged house and see if the water level has receded. The situation is no different this year. The water from nearby Osman Nagar lake gushed into our house just after two spells of rain last week.‚Äù Even today, Rahman and his family members have no other way but to wade through the slush and sewage water that is still accumulated in front of his house whose foundations are gradually deteriorating because of the inundation. As the monsoon keeps them on tenterhooks, many say that they are having sleepless nights as the water levels of Osman Nagar lake rise with each spell of rain. ‚ÄúWe are having sleepless nights as the water levels of Osman Nagar lake have started to rise again. After education minister Sabita Indira Reddy recently inspected the area, the officials of Jalpally municipality have begun the reconstruction works of Osman Nagar Lake bund but it is of no use as it has already started developing cracks and is getting washed away due to rains. We need a permanent solution,‚Äù said Afreen Begum, a resident of Osman Nagar. The open area right in front of Afreen‚Äôs house is completely covered with algal weeds and has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Residents also claim that the outlet channels which have been closed to protect nearby colony from getting flooded is one of the reasons for flooding last year. According to the officials from the municipality, the bund which stretches across one km and is about 12 feet wide is being constructed to protect the flood water from protecting the houses. Agreeing that several houses are still suffering the impact of last year‚Äôs floods, G Praveen Kumar, commissioner, Jalpally municipality said, ‚ÄúA lot of houses are still affected because they are constructed in lake FTL (full tank level) area and we cannot do anything about it because the case is still pending in high court.‚Äù However, the commissioner informed that they are taking all precautionary measures to face the upcoming monsoon issues which include construction of manuals for drains, clearing of inlets and outlets and construction of a bund on the left side of Osman Nagar lake, which stretches across one km and is about 12 feet wide, to protect the flood water from entering the houses in the area. The municipality is reconstructing the damaged bund with a special fund of Rs 20 lakh sanctioned by the district collector Rangareddy on the representation of minister Sabitha Indra Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/osman-nagar-residents-still-reel-under-flood-impact-slam-officials/articleshow/84306042.cms||Moulika.KV

According to experts, the risk of spread of Covid-19 infection is much higher in kanwar yatra than it was at the Maha Kumbh mela as the number of devotees undertaking the yatra is likely to be significantly higher than those who attended Kumbh. The footfall for kanwar yatra in the previous years has ranged between 2 crore and 5 crore. Anoop Nautiyal, whose organisation Social Development for Communities Foundation, has been closely tracking the Covid scenario in the state, said, ‚ÄúEven if standard operating procedures (SOPs) regarding Covid behaviour are put in place and the kanwar yatra allowed, the SOPs will be impossible to implement. We have seen that at the Kumbh and more recently when lockdown restrictions were eased and tourists flocked to hill stations.‚Äù Nautiyal added, ‚ÄúKanwar yatra will be many times more dangerous than Kumbh. About 3 to 4 crore pilgrims will visit Haridwar in a fortnight compared with the 70 lakh that came during the 30-day Kumbh. The state will not be able to handle the infection spread post-kanwar yatra. A decision must be taken keeping in mind the third wave of Covid-19.‚Äù Dr NS Khatri, deputy medical superintendent and Covid care centre coordinator of the state's largest Covid facility, Doon Medical College Hospital, said, "In an ideal situation it (the kanwar yatra) should be avoided as Uttarakhand has already recorded its first Delta-plus case. If it's not possible to avoid the yatra, then strict Covid protocols should be followed by kanwariyas visiting Haridwar." City-based activist Jay Singh Rawat added that the government must keep in mind lessons from the Kumbh. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have the health infrastructure, especially in the hills, to deal with the large number of infections,‚Äù he said.

District collector Navjot Khosa convened a high level meeting on Saturday to review the situation in the district in which district medical officer and officials in charge of surveillance and communicable diseases attended. In the meeting, the district health administration observed that the patients have recovered from the symptoms and hence they would not transmit the disease. However, the presence of the infective vectors in the community is a major public health concern. Though this is not a severe disease in the general population, it becomes a concern if it infects pregnant women in their early trimester, the meeting pointed out. The district disaster management authority has decided that focus should be given to vector management and care should be given to prevent transmission of infection to pregnant women. Measures to control mosquito breeding indoors and in peridomestic areas is the only way to contain the spread of infections in the community. The district collector has urged the health department to ensure that the district vigilance committee unit of health services department conduct vector surveillance in Thiruvananthapuram corporation area and provide technical advisories to the local self-government for mosquito control activities. In addition to this, fever clinics should be started and strengthened in all peripheral institutions. Steps shall be taken to provide awareness regarding personal protective measures against mosquito bites in antenatal clinics. The district surveillance officer and district programme manager of the national health mission should ensure that Zika containment awareness is imparted to the urban medical officers and ASHA workers. Measures should be taken to ensure strict deferral of blood donors with history of fever in the previous two weeks. All ultra sound scanning centres have been directed to report incidences of microcephally (a condition in which a baby‚Äôs head is significantly smaller than expected) during regular antenatal scans. All the local bodies in the district have been asked to start mosquito control activities in public places and uninhabited area. Municipal health services shall do fogging and spraying as per the technical directions. The ward-level health sanitation committees (WHSC) have been entrusted with the task of source reduction of mosquitoes activities. The ward level health sanitation members should take steps to inspect residential areas/public and private offices for mosquito breeding. Once in a week, all houses, including flats, should be visited and directions to eliminate the source should be given. Follow up visits after two days should be done to ensure that they have complied with instructions, the collector has said in her order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/strict-vector-control-steps-in-dist/articleshow/84304031.cms||---

Former minister and TPCC working president J Geetha Reddy on Saturday said the TRS minister‚Äôs vulgar comment against a mandal parishad development woman officer only reflects the attitude of this government in Telangana. ‚ÄúCM KCR should immediately take stern action against the minister and send a clear message that no one, irrespective of their status will be spared if they harass or discriminate against women,‚Äù Geetha Reddy said.

Dehradun district magistrate Ashish Srivastava had issued orders on Friday that tourists will be allowed in Mussoorie only if they have an RT-PCR-negative report, a prior hotel booking and proof of registration on the smart city portal. Police officials said they were checking the tourists‚Äô details at the check posts and this led to vehicles being stopped, and many tourists who did not have relevant documents sent back. "There was a long queue of vehicles at the checkpoint after crossing Dehradun [Kuthal Gate] and we had to wait for nearly 30 minutes before we could proceed further. Subsequently, traffic snarls were observed till Mussoorie," lamented Rahul Ranjan, a tourist. Harshvardhan Singh, a tourist coming from Gurgaon, said, ‚ÄúWe came to know about the revised SOP to enter Mussoorie on Saturday morning. Since we had registration on the smart city website and RT-PCR negative report along with hotel reservation, we were confident. But, the long queue made people wait for too long.‚Äù Meanwhile, Sanjay Agarwal, secretary, Mussoorie Hotels' Association, said, ‚ÄúThe orders from Dehradun have come as a huge relief as the traffic is being strictly monitored. The shops close down by 7 pm and restaurants by 10 pm.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/long-traffic-jams-on-approach-road-to-mussoorie-tourists-sans-sops-return/articleshow/84302500.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Easing of curbs brings relief to tourism but revival still far away||AHMEDABAD: Receding cases of Covid-19 and relaxation of curbs imposed to check its spread, as well as relatively cool weather have encouraged travel and tourism. The pandemic had heavily battered this sector. Tourist destinations such as Diu, Saputara, Daman, Udaipur, Mount Abu, Statue of Unity, Sasan Gir, Somnath and Dwarka, among many others, are at present teeming with people, who were perhaps waiting to get out. Industry estimates indicate that the business has gained traction and bookings over each weekend till the end of August are full across all nearby tourist destinations within and around the state. With relaxation in Covid-19 restrictions, thousands of tourists from south Gujarat are rushing to closer destinations Saputara and Daman. On weekends, Saputara is chaotic with nasty traffic snarls whereas the bulk of hotels in Daman are running full even though beaches are yet to open. ‚ÄúRestaurants and hotels have good bookings on weekends. The tourist flow will increase gradually as the government announces some more relaxations,‚Äù said Harish Tangal, vice-president, Daman Hoteliers Association. The same is the case with Saputara too. ‚ÄúPeople from nearby destinations are driving down to Saputara for weekend. But those from farther destinations, including neighbouring states, are avoiding travel,‚Äù said Shamitabh Jena, associate vice-president, Lords Group of Hotels. Tour operators claim shorter getaways are being preferred over long-haul travel and people are opting for personally driveable destinations to avoid public transport and risks of proximity to strangers. Hotel business ringing in off-season:Greater traction in travel is also boosting hotel occupancies at tourist destinations across the state and even in the nearby states. Estimates by Hotels and Restaurants‚Äô Association (HRA) ‚Äì Gujarat suggest that average occupancy levels at tourist destinations have grown upwards of 50% and this is a good sign of revival for both the tourism and hospitality sector. The Statue of Unity has been witnessing tremendous footfalls through the week and running near sold out over the weekends. Nikhil Aggarwal, partner at Lallooji and Sons which manages the SoU tent city, said, ‚ÄúThe turnout is decent; people who were cooped up within homes through the second wave are now beginning to step out. Some 61 rooms at the tent city are 100% sold out over the weekends.‚Äù The occupancy level is 100% over the weekend at hotels in Diu, Junagadh, Sasan, Dwarka and Mandvi of Kutch, according to travel agents. Industry players said that such a rush is usually seen over the festive season and long-weekend holidays. ‚ÄúBeing the onset of monsoon, July is usually a slack period for tourism. However, this time, after the second wave, the tourism business has picked up significantly with hotels across Diu remaining full,‚Äù said a hotelier based in Diu. The Gir National Park is closed because of the lion mating season, but the region is attracting tourists who go there for short getaways. Devaliya Safari park is still open, and so is the Girnar ropeway, which are becoming big crowd-pullers. A number of resorts at nearby destinations are also running full over the weekends. ‚ÄúWe took a break with family, after long,‚Äù said Vishvesh Majumdar, a businessman. Slow movement worries travel operators:Despite the surge in tourist movement over the past three weeks, the revival is far from the pre-Covid levels, feel industry players. Manish Sharma, chairman, Travel Agents‚Äô Federation of India (TAFI) ‚Äì Gujarat chapter, said, ‚ÄúDomestic tourism business from Gujarat was pegged at Rs 800 crore per annum in the pre-pandemic period. The recent uptick in the tourist movement is not even remotely close to a revival in domestic tourism. In 2021-22, the summer vacation season, which accounts for at least 60% of our revenues, was wiped out due to the sinister second wave of Covid-19 infections.‚Äù Another big season for travel is Diwali holidays. However, tour operators say that people have stopped planning in advance for their breaks and therefore, there are barely any inquiries to get bookings for Diwali break. ‚ÄúThe third wave threat is still looming and therefore, people have just not planned for holidaying in Diwali. Our focus is also on long weekends in August for which tour operators have launched packages. We have realized that people are not making longterm plans being wary of Covid. If the situation remains well, we may see some movement for Diwali booking, a month or two later,‚Äù said Anuj Pathak, president, Tour operators and travel agents‚Äô Association of Gujarat (TAG).

John Paul of Ennakkidangu Purayidam House, Anchuthengu is the deceased. According to the police, the mishap occurred around 10.30am while Paul and fellow fishermen were returning to the shore after a nightlong fishing trip. He was part of a three-member crew that had set out into the sea from Anchughengu in a small boat fitted with an outboard engine. Paul was the one who was operating the outboard motor of the boat. The two fishermen who survived the mishap told the police that as the boat reached a distance of around three kilometres from the shore, its engine failed. However, strong winds and the current helped them drift close to the shore near Perumathura, around 500m south of the Muthalapozhi breakwater here. But, as they got closer to the shore, the intensity of the waves got stronger. They realized that the boat would crash against the shore owing to strong waves. Had it happened, the survival chances would have been lower. Hence they decided to abandon the boat and swim to the shore. While the two others managed to swim to safety, Paul could not. He drowned just a few metres away from the shore. His friends immediately dived back into the sea and helped him get to the shore. He was rushed to Chirayinkeezh Government District Hospital, but the doctors declared him dead on arrival. The police suspect that besides the strong waves, exhaustion might also have played a key role in the death of Paul. His friends told the police that until the moment they decided to abandon the boat, Paul was desperately trying to repair the motor and restart it. Paul is the fourth person to lose life in the sea at Anchuthengu. Three weeks ago, a five-year-old boy had died after he was swept away by strong waves while standing close to the sea along with his brother. Two days later, a 19-year-old man drowned after his boat capsized near Perumathura. A week later, a 57-year-old fisherman died after his boat capsized at the mouth of Muthalapozhi breakwater, which is a danger zone for the fishermen using small boats. All these mishaps, including the death of Paul on Saturday, have happened while the district collector‚Äôs warning to stay away from the sea based on weather alerts was in effect. The collector had issued a warning on Friday asking fishermen not to venture into the sea till Tuesday after India Meteorological Department predicted strong winds with speed ranging from 40 to 45 km/hour along the coasts of Kerala, Karnataka and Lakshadweep. The collector has on Saturday extended the ban till Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/fisherman-killed-as-boat-capsizes/articleshow/84304087.cms||---

According to city-based historians, Bonalu began during the reign of Qutb Shahi rulers in 1675. Abul Hasan Tanisha‚Äôs minister Madana built a temple for Ellamma on Golconda Fort, where the first Bonam was offered to mark the month-long celebrations. The main part of the celebrations is offering bonam (meal) to appease the goddesses for protecting families from diseases. Women carry an earthen pot on their heads adorned with neem leaves, turmeric and a lamp on the top of the pot and offer them to the temple deities. The famous Lashkar Bonalu started much after Golconda Bonalu. According to historians, Suriti Ayyappa, a doli-bearer in the military, visited Mahankali temple at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh in 1815 and was shocked to see that thousands of people died of cholera. After the decline in cholera cases and restoration of normalcy, he built a temple dedicated to Mahankali at Lashkar in Secunderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bonalu-in-t-started-during-the-reign-of-the-qutb-shahi-rulers-in-1675/articleshow/84306106.cms||Sunil Mungara

Kolhapur district has been in Level 4 since June 7. A month later, the number of Covid cases remains on the higher side when compared to other districts in the state. Acting in-charge district collector Dr.Kadambari Balkawade, in the order, said, ‚ÄúThe positivity rate of Kolhapur district according, to the RT-PCR test reports between July 1 and 7 is at 12.2%. Therefore, Level 4 restrictions are extended till further notice.‚Äù No guidelines have been received from the state government regarding the opening of non-essential shops in the district. Only essential shops in the city and district will remain operational from Monday between 7 am to 4 pm, the order said. Meanwhile, the traders in Kolhapur city and district area are firm on opening their shops on Monday (July 12). Lalit Gandhi, the senior deputy head of the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, said, ‚ÄúThe positivity rate for Kolhapur city was below 10% last week even when the non-essential shops were opened for five days on a trial basis. This shows that there is no connection between the positivity rate and the opening of shops. From Monday, traders will continue to keep their shops open. We have written to the district administration and have also met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to demand permission to keep our shops open in places that have a positivity rate below 10% across the district. The marketplaces at towns like Ichalkaranji, Gadhinglaj, Jaysingpur, Peth Vadgaon, Kagal, Hupari and Gandhi Nagar should be considered separately while calculating the positivity rates.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-in-level-4-but-traders-plan-to-open-shops-from-monday/articleshow/84300572.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Lakhs of women congregate to pay obeisance to goddess Mahankali by offering their ‚Äòbonams‚Äô in 25 temples across cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. The month-long Bonalu celebrations will kick off by offering the first golden bonam to goddess Jagdamba temple at Golconda Fort at 12 noon. With Covid-19 pandemic cases on the surge in 2020, the Telangana government had restricted Bonalu festival celebrations in the temples. After a massive vaccination drive being taken up by the authorities, this is the first festival which the government is celebrating after the lockdown was relaxed. The temple authorities are expecting an unprecedented crowd this time, as women could not fulfil their bonam offerings to the goddesses due to the pandemic last year. ‚ÄúSocial distancing and wearing of masks are mandatory for every woman devotee. Temple staff and police will jointly supervise adherence to social distancing and masks at Golconda Fort. Separate barricades from the Golconda Fort and up to hilltop have been arranged. Announcements through the public address system on sticking to Covid-19 guideliness will be made,‚Äù in-charge executive officer of Golconda Jagadamba temple S Mahender Kumar told STOI. ‚ÄúWe are expecting 30,000 to 50,000 women devotees to visit the temple and offer bonams during the month-long festival. Expecting heavy rush during Tuesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, a massive sanitisation will be taken up,‚Äù he said. The entire temple complex on the hilltop has been painted for the occasion. The celebrations then move on to Ujjaini Mahakali temple at Secunderabad (Lashkar Bonalu) and Lal Darwaja temple in Old City.

His family physician prescribed him general medicines and asked him to get tested for Covid-19. Thatte tested negative for Covid-19 on Friday. ‚ÄúI am feeling relieved. Now fever is receding. Cough is still there. But as far as it‚Äôs not Covid-19, I am feeling better,‚Äù he said. Many like Thatte, who are experiencing symptoms like fever, cough, cold and body ache are going for Covid-19 tests after advise of their physicians. ‚ÄúGeneral physicians are still cautious. We are enquiring about vaccination status of the patient, Covid-19 history of their family-members and their work pattern before advising them to go for a test,‚Äù said physician Dr Deepak Kamble. Due to the limitations on contact tracing as cascading effect of declining new cases, the health admin in Vidarbha is now focusing on random testing at marketplaces, mobile van testing, and village-level testing formats to meet the daily testing targets. With weather change, viral fever cases are on rise. Doctors are advising these patients to get tested for Covid-19. ‚ÄúBhandara district has reported zero new cases twice in this week. Despite this, we are conducting more than 500 tests on an average daily. Our focus is on rural areas. More tests are being conducted in villages now,‚Äù said district collector Sandeep Kadam.

The target of contact tracing is 20 contacts per patient which will ensure not more than 3,000 tests per day in Vidarbha. But, the region is conducting up to 20,000 tests per day. ‚ÄúEven if the daily test count has reduced due to less positive cases this week, we are trying to recover it through more random tests,‚Äù said a senior official from divisional health office, Nagpur. More than 4,000 tests are being conducted in city while about 2,000 tests in rural Nagpur every day. In Yavatmal, the daily test count has gone down this week, but the administration has now started focusing on those who are unvaccinated and still working in factories/establishments. ‚ÄúWorkers in Shops, establishments and factories in district are being asked to get themselves tested once in 10 days if they are not vaccinated. Especially those working in closed environment must get tested to ensure other‚Äôs safety,‚Äù said Dr Rahul Mohod from Yavatmal. Vidarbha‚Äôs testing capacity has increased multifold and districts can conduct up to 70,000 tests in 24 hours. ‚ÄúIn Buldhana, we are making it a point to conduct more than 3,000 tests per day. More than 1,600 samples are collected for RT-PCR daily. This has ensured decline in positivity rate,‚Äù said Dr Dilip Kamble, District Health Officer of Buldhana.

The local self-government department (LSGD) has recently directed the local bodies to tap own/plan fund to raise viability gap fund (VGF) to make up for the income deficit of members of Haritha Karma Sena. Haritha Karma Sena workers who thrive on user fee collected from households and commercial establishments/shops have been unable to meet their needs due to practical difficulties in waste collection owing to the spread of Covid-19. The city corporation officials said that at present, civic body may not need to divert money from own fund to provide VGF for Haritha Karma Sena. The shops have remained closed due to restrictions and health concerns had prevented the workers from engaging in waste collection at houses where Covid-positive persons were quarantined. This has deprived the workers of basic income on March, April and May. Suchitwa Mission executive director reported that Haritha Karma Sena workers have been active on the field despite the challenges and that it was imperative to ensure basic income for them. The director suggested utilizing VGF for the purpose. LSGD has given sanction to the proposal. Local self-government secretaries will ensure that on the days when the workers are on duty, they will receive a basic daily wage of Rs 750. VGF shall be used to bridge the gap between expected monthly income and actual income. As per the document prepared for the functioning of Haritha Karma Sena workers, income from user fee, amount collected from sale of scrap and other items are the sources of monthly income. The department has directed that special wages shall be disbursed for the workers if local bodies engage them in services other than door-to-door collection and segregation of non-biodegradable materials. The department has however pointed out that VGF shall not be given in local bodies where basic duties were not fulfilled in spite of ideal circumstances. All local bodies which have not made Haritha Karma Sena functional have been directed to make it operational within three months.

The UK government‚Äôs new post-study graduate route for international students, which opened its applications from July 1, has only come as an added advantage for many. Countries such as Australia and New Zealand have shut their doors to Indians ever since the pandemic hit the world. This forced many students to look away for alternative options in other countries. ‚ÄúI wanted to pursue business analytics in La Trobe University in Australia. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I expected the country to open it‚Äôs doors for foreign-bound students. When it didn‚Äôt, I decided to look for options in the UK and finally was able to secure a seat in international business in Loughborough University,‚Äù said Sarika Butukur, a student who is set to fly out to the UK for the October intake. Many students are upbeat about the post-study graduate route for international students. This route enables eligible students who have completed undergraduate and postgraduate degrees to stay for two years and those who have completed PhD courses to stay for three years to seek employment. ‚ÄúThere are only few countries that allow international students to seek employment after they complete their education. I am glad that I‚Äôd get this opportunity to look for jobs after completing my masters in international relations in 2022,‚Äù said Vidya Mohan, a student. Recent research by IDP Connect with international students who began their studies in the UK, Canada, Australia, USA or New Zealand in Autumn 2020, shows that the UK is ahead of other destinations in offering international students such flexibility. ‚ÄúWe have observed a manifold increase in the number of students seeking to study in the UK and a sharp drop in number of students applying for Australia. The pandemic does not seem to have any major impact on the travel plans of foreign-bound students as the number of students wanting to pursue higher education were only 30-50 per cent higher than last year,‚Äù said Piyush Kumar, regional director (South Asia), IDP Education, an overseas education consultancy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-take-uk-route-for-higher-edu-as-aus-denies-entry/articleshow/84306135.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: From results in under a minute to minimal infra, testing tech evolves||MUMBAI: New Covid-19 tests, including one that promises a diagnosis within a minute, will be launched next week, pointing to a sea change in detection technologies over the past 15 months in the country. While multinational Abbott will launch a new rapid test, Mumbai-based company, MediCircle Health Pvt Ltd, will bring Israeli technology to detect the Covid-19-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus in saliva swab or gargled water within seconds. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology (NIV) have also transferred their new technology‚Äîcalled RT-LAMP‚Äîthat allows an RT-PCR test to be done within three hours as opposed to the regular four to six hours. Dr Nilesh Shah, chief of science and innovation, Metropolis Laboratory, said Covid-19 diagnostics have changed immensely in the past 15 to 16 months. ‚ÄúThe RT-PCR test remains the gold standard, but it too has evolved in terms of requirement of time, manpower and incubation period,‚Äù he said. The new RT-PCR tests can deliver results in a matter of five minutes, though they carry premium charges of up to Rs 4,500. However, with some countries such as the UAE demanding RT-PCR reports that are taken four hours before boarding, such quick RT-PCR have takers. RT-PCR tests, though, due to their huge infrastructure and investment requirements cannot be used for mass testing easily. This is where rapid ‚Äúpoint of care‚Äù tests that can deliver results in under 15 minutes are useful. Pranav Kolhi of MediCircle Health said their new test not only gives results in less than a minute, these are transferred to the ICMR‚Äôs Covid portal instantly. ‚ÄúThere is no question of a positive test, done using a rapid antigen method or a home-based test, not getting registered,‚Äù he added. This will help trace cases and carry out public health measures to check any spread. A pilot study done in Delhi among 207 samples showed that the test has 93.5% sensitivity. ‚ÄúAs it is a point of care technology, it can be used for mass screening at airport, resorts, offices, malls, etc,‚Äù added Kohli. The Israeli test works on the principle that when infected by the virus, the body produces chemicals that emit a certain wavelength. ‚ÄúWhen a sample from the patient is inserted into our hand-held device, a spectra is generated, giving instant analysis,‚Äù said the press release. Dr Shah of Metropolis said that in the earlier days of Covid, the rapid antigen tests were not very accurate, but the tests available now are very sensitive. ‚ÄúWe have tests that use breath, voice, smell, and gargle to detect Covid,‚Äù said Dr Shah. Consider a football match where an audience needs to be tested in the shortest possible time before being let into the stadium. ‚ÄúA rapid test such as smell would require people to breathe out on a special sheet of paper and answer a few questions on their mobile. All these steps take a minute before the result is available. If you get a barcode, you can enter the stadium. If not, you need to proceed for the RT-PCR test for a confirmation test,‚Äù said Dr Shah. An ICMR press release said, ‚ÄúThe World Health Organization has urgently demanded an extension of screening and testing. With this, to address the Covid-19 pandemic, an accurate, low-cost and user-friendly diagnostic method is the need of the hour, and so, RT-LAMP is ideal for the nation‚Äôs requirements and conditions.‚Äù ICMR officials said there is an urgent need to build the testing capacity of India. ‚ÄúThe RT-LAMP method‚Äôs speed and simplicity allow it to be the ideal method for diagnosing the infection,‚Äù they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-from-results-in-under-a-minute-to-minimal-infra-testing-tech-evolves/articleshow/84306184.cms||---

---||Vadodara||Locals renew demand for Arnej-Tarapur railway line||Vadodara/ Anand: Residents in Central Gujarat have renewed their demand for setting up 45km Arnej-Tarapur railway line that can shorten travel time between Saurashtra-Kutch and south Gujarat. The Arnej-Tarapur railway line proposal is one of the oldest proposals pending under consideration with the Indian Railways since decades. In 2012, the then union railway minister Dinesh Trivedi had even announced it as a new line survey to be taken up in 2012-13. The summary of surveys in progress by the end of 2014 in Western Railways shows that the survey was targeted to be completed in 2015-16. The Gujarat Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation (G-RIDE), a joint venture of Gujarat government and Ministry of Railways, shows the broad gauge line project estimated at the cost of Rs 484 crore is an ‚Äúupcoming project‚Äù. G-RIDE‚Äôs website reflects that feasibility cum bankability study of the railway line has been completed by the consultants. ‚ÄúG-RIDE has approached Railway Board to accord in-principle approval to G-RIDE for execution of this project by forming a project (special purpose vehicle) SPV under 100 % equity model with GoG and MoR being principle equity holders in proportion of 51:49,‚Äù the status report of the project states. Kheda MP Devusinh Chauhan and Anand MP Mitesh Patel alias Bakabhai too have approached the railways ministry and asked Vadodara railway division to expedite the project. ‚ÄúRailway connectivity from Ahmedabad-Botad to new Arnej-Tarapur railway line can immensely benefit locals. While the movement of passenger trains can be quicker towards Mumbai, Madhya Pradesh and south Gujarat, goods train too will reach two hours early to Mumbai,‚Äù said a resident Girish Dave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/locals-renew-demand-for-arnej-tarapur-railway-line/articleshow/84304160.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Trial resumes in Rs 6-crore hashish oil seizure case||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With the lockdown restrictions being eased, trial procedures of many crime cases that were stalled have resumed at courts. One important case that has thus resumed is the trial of three accused, who were caught with hashish oil worth over Rs 6 crore from the city nearly three years ago. The trial is progressing before the district additional sessions court VII. Last week, the witness examination by both the prosecution and defence as part of the trial came to an end. The final argument has also commenced following this. The judge is expected to pronounce the judgement within a few days. The case pertains to the arrest of three men, Anthony Rosario Fernandez of Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu, and Benoy Thomas and Gopi Thankamani in Idukki on September 1, 2018. They were caught by an excise special team when they met at Attakkulangara in the city for drug transaction. Hashish oil weighing 6.40kg, cash worth Rs 6.70 lakh, a Tata Sumo SUV and Toyota Etios car were seized. The accused have been serving in the prison as undertrial without a bail ever since. The catch was made by a team led by excise circle inspector T Anikumar. The prosecution case is that Thomas and Thankamani brought the hashish oil to the city to hand it over to Fernandez. The drug was meant to be smuggled to Maldives. Fernandez was acting as a middleman between the buyer identified as Abdullah, a Maldivian citizen, and the seller, who was identified as Ullas of Idukki. Thomas and Thankamani were acting under the directives of Ullas, who had procured the hashish oil from Andhra Pradesh. Public prosecutor K N Hareesh Kumar is leading the prosecution team in the case. They examined 13 witnesses, 87 documents and 48 material objects against the accused during the witness examination. The defence counsel, meanwhile, examined 17 witnesses and 15 documents in favour of the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/trial-resumes-in-rs-6-cr-hashish-oil-seizure-case/articleshow/84304154.cms||---

None of them wanted to speak officially till the ordinance is issued, and they said the state government was simply inviting litigation. A budget school trustee said the government was ‚Äúharming itself‚Äù with such steps. ‚ÄúThink of why private schools have flourished over the last two decades. It‚Äôs a clear message from parents that they prefer private schools over those run by government,‚Äù they said. The trustee added, ‚ÄúWhy else would they reject free education and take admission where thousands, if not lakhs, have to be paid every year. Parents line up to collect admission forms and pull strings to secure a seat, whereas government schools struggle for admissions.‚Äù The trustee further said that the government was harming itself because if schools were to function under duress, they would simply shut down and crores of students would drop of out the education system. ‚ÄúDoes the government have the capacity to absorb so many students?‚Äù A trustee from western Maharashtra said, ‚ÄúAlready dozens of schools across the state have approached the courts over this issue. If the government plans to bypass everyone and straight away go ahead with an ordinance, it will lead to chaos.‚Äù Another trustee, who manages a CBSE school, said government‚Äôs interference in the fee issue goes against the ‚Äúspirit of cooperation‚Äù. ‚ÄúPrivate schools are cooperating with the government to help raise the bar of education. Students are enrolling in private schools because they feel more value-added benefits will accrue to their child,‚Äù said the trustee. To provide such benefits, the trustee added, ‚ÄúThe school needs to invest in infrastructure, hire the best talent and also constantly keep upgrading to maintain the standard. But if the government forcibly tries to intervene in the fee issue, then majority of schools will simply shut down.‚Äù While it‚Äôs not known what exactly the ordinance will contain, minister Gaikwad did confirm that the major concern was the state not having authority to intervene in the fee issue. Hence, it is expected that the ordinance may empower education officials to deal with fee disputes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/school-trustees-unhappy-over-ordinance-proposal/articleshow/84304168.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The mentorship project is being launched along with district administration looking at the probable third wave, which is expected to hit the rural and paediatric population hard. District collector Ravindra Thakare visited the IMA office in Nagpur recently and finalized the PHC mentorship project. IMA Nagpur president Dr Sanjay Deotale represented the doctors. Collector Thakare said the government has limited infrastructure and people still have more faith in the private healthcare sector. ‚ÄúWe want to take the benefit of private doctors and patients‚Äô relationship to fight the third wave of pandemic. An e-platform for this is ready. We are going to launch it soon,‚Äù he said. ENT surgeon and head of the mucormycosis task force Dr Prashant Nikhade said that uniform paediatric Covid guidelines should be formed ahead of the anticipated third wave. ‚ÄúAs IMA is ready for the mentorship project, the government should give details of working pattern in this project. We will share our experience to handle emergency and shifting of patients in Covid care centres or dedicated Covid centres with the doctors,‚Äù said Dr Nikhade. IMA‚Äôs counsel, advocate Bhanudas Kulkarni said that it‚Äôs a novel social gesture by IMA Nagpur. ‚ÄúDoctors are ready to share their expertise with ground workers in PHCs, which will empower every primary healthcare centre of Nagpur district,‚Äù he said. Former IMA president Dr YS Deshpande suggested that beds in Nagpur‚Äôs Covid care centres or dedicated Covid centres should be earmarked for patients coming from rural PHCs. ‚ÄúThis is necessary, as rural areas are going to be affected badly in case the wave hits,‚Äù said Dr Deshpande. Dr Archana Kothari said that queries of mentors should be resolved on priority basis. Dr Sunil Lanjewar demanded that infrastructure and logistics like medicines and oxygen should be arranged in advance. IMA Nagpur vice-president Dr Manjusha Giri said that doctors were ready to guide the health workers in rural areas if the government arranges for an orientation programme of PHCs.

Aksharasena (Army of Letters) which functions as part of Sandhya Grameena Grandhasala in Tholicode panchayat has succeeded in achieving nearly 100% vaccination for the residents of Pulichamala. The volunteers, a group of youngsters, have so far helped 712 people register online for the Covid-19 vaccination. Out of the 712, only a few are yet to receive their jab. With online registration was made mandatory, there was chaos among some local residents of Pulichamala. Many found it difficult to register themselves on the portal. ‚ÄúWhen we realised that many from our area, including the elderly, are clueless on how to do online registration, we felt that it was our responsibility to help them. Otherwise, they would have to struggle a lot to make the registration and vaccination possible,‚Äù said R K Rahul, the convenor of the library. Aiming at complete immunisation, these youngsters formed the Aksharasena Covid vaccination help desk and through a WhatsApp group, collected the details of residents needing help. During the initial phase, they collected information on the people eligible for vaccination in their families. After completing their registrations successfully, they extended their activities to other residents too. Besides the locals of Pulichamala, people residing in different areas of Palode and Vithura also benefited from their service. They also ensured that people received their jabs at the scheduled time. ‚ÄúIf they found it difficult to visit the vaccination centre, we also made necessary arrangements,‚Äù said Rahul. The help desk which functions at the library has nearly 22 volunteers. When the stringent lockdown restrictions were lifted, the volunteers visited houses to collect the details of people who were not yet registered for vaccination. Also, these youngsters provided an awareness regarding the need to get vaccinated. ‚ÄúSome were hesitant to be vaccinated. They were confused about the need to get the vaccination. In such cases, we gave them awareness regarding the same and convinced them to get vaccinated,‚Äù said Rahul. The maximum registration they did on a day was 32. The team is not done yet. They are now helping the relatives of the local residents who are residing in different localities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/volunteers-help-people-with-vaccine-registration/articleshow/84304204.cms||---

P B Gandal, the deputy director of health (Nashik division), said due to the huge vaccination programme in Nashik district, a good portion of the vaccines has been allotted to Nashik district, followed by Ahmednagar. Of the total stock of vaccine doses, 91,500 are Covishield and 19,040 are Covaxin, he said. Nashik district has been allotted 33,100 doses of Covishield and 5,300 doses of Covaxin. Gandal said Nashik has been allotted more stock considering a large number of people from the district have taken their first dose and are waiting for the second dose. There are sufficient vaccination centres across the division and there have been days when 40, 000 to 50,000 doses have been administered in a day in the division. Thus, as per the availability, the doses are given to people. The division has been getting the stock of vaccines as and when available. However, the stock of vaccines arrives after every few days to ensure people do not have to wait for the vaccine. The office of the deputy director of health, Nashik division, sends the vaccine van to the state office in Pune to collect the vaccines. On the way to Nashik, the quota of vaccines for Ahmednagar is delivered and the remaining stock is brought to Nashik. After taking the quota for Nashik district, the vaccine quota for Dhule, Jalgaon and Nandurbar is sent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-division-receives-over-1l-covid-vaccine-doses/articleshow/84300692.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The students were members of a group that had gone for picnic there. According to sources, a group of 12 second year MBBS students had gone to Rasulpur which is a popular site for outings and picnics amongst residents of Vadodara. The group entered the river to bathe. However, the heavy current in the river dragged away four students including the deceased Siddhi Shah (20) and Amogh Goel (20). While two students managed to hold on to rocks and returned to safety, Shah and Goel drowned in a deep depression in the river. Other members of the group too rushed out of the river and raised an alarm to get help. Villagers rushed to the spot and brought out Shah and Goel from the river albeit after some delay as they could not be found immediately. The students called for an ambulance and even performed CPR on Shah and Goel. The two students, in critical condition, were rushed to the SSG Hospital in the city to which the college is attached. The doctors at the hospital could not save them despite all efforts. The two other students who had started drowning along with Shah and Goel were stable. Sources said that the entire group was in a state of shock and was given succour by teachers at the college. Sources said that the depression at the site is known. In the past too similar incidents have been reported there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/2-baroda-medical-college-students-drown-in-mahi/articleshow/84304289.cms||---

Researchers from National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), who conducted the awareness campaign along with local volunteers, rated Kovalam beach, which was earlier pushed by the state for the international Blue Flag certification as ‚Äòdirty‚Äô in the Clean Coast Index. NCCR scientist Pravakar Mishra, who coordinated the cleanup as part of ‚ÄòSwachhata Pakhwada‚Äô, said 10% of the waste were face masks and 15% were items used in religious rituals ‚Äî items they had not found in previous beach cleanup activities at the location. ‚ÄúCompared to our previous cleanup here, Kovalam beach is slowly turning bad. But we were surprised we did not find plastic spoons, straws and cigarette buds which we usually collect in big quantities during our beach clean-ups,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe cannot say it is because of the ban on entry to beaches because we saw more than 500 people in the beach while we were involved in the clean-up activity. The absence of straws and spoons could be because of the ban on plastics,‚Äù he said. Based on the waste collected, NCCR scientists calculated the Clean Coast Index (CCI), which was proposed by an Israeli scientist, and they rated Kovalam beach as ‚Äòdirty‚Äô. The CCI has four categories ‚Äî very dirty, dirty, clean and very clean. The volunteers also raised awareness among the visitors and fishermen on beach litter and their impact on marine life and tourism. A volunteer group with schoolchildren was also formed to monitor beach cleanliness and to advise the adults on the ill-effects of littering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/haul-of-the-day-150kg-waste-from-kovalam-beach/articleshow/84304243.cms||---

Superintendent of police (Nashik rural) Sachin Patil said around 300 people have been booked mainly during weekends at the tourist spots. Prohibitory orders are already in place concerning the assembly of five or more people. The rural police have warned people of confiscating vehicles if people arrive in large groups. While vehicles have not been confiscated yet, the police have taken action against tourists for not wearing masks or not maintaining social distancing. There are many scenic locations in Wadivarhe, Ghoti, Igatpuri and Trimbakeshwar. As the weekend lockdown is in force and most of the establishments are closed, a large number of people start going to such locations. As per the directives of the SP, police personnel of various police stations have been deployed on roads leading to scenic locations. Those spotted without masks are fined on spot, said the police. Patil had recently uploaded a video on social media appealing to people to follow Covid norms to prevent the spread of the infection. The infection rate is currently under control and it should not increase due to the negligence of people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/300-booked-for-covid-rule-violations-at-nashik-tourist-spots/articleshow/84300770.cms||Santosh Sonawane

However, night curfew across the state from 11pm to 5am will continue. The fresh guidelines allow people, who have received the first dose of Covid vaccine, to go to cinema halls, multiplexes and attend exhibitions, though these places will operate with 50 per cent capacity under a specific time period. The order stated that shops and commercial institutions where 60 per cent of the staff have received the first dose of vaccine can remain open for an additional four hours from 4pm to 8pm. Similarly, restaurants have been allowed to open till 10pm, subject to certain conditions, which include Covid-appropriate behavior, proper sanitisation, regular thermal screening and use of masks. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot said though Rajasthan had recorded a decline in cases, he warned that the state as a whole was not cleared of the virus yet. ‚ÄúPeople should wear masks and take precautions to avert the third wave of the pandemic,‚Äù he said.

---||Nagpur||Not registered with paramedical council, MD pathologists being served closure notices||NAGPUR: Dr Pankaj Saklinwar is MD in pathology and runs a diagnostic laboratory in Gadchiroli. On July 5, he received a notice from the tehsildar saying legal action will be initiated against his lab if he fails to provide his registration with the Maharashtra Paramedical Council (MPC). Dr Saklinwar was shocked to see the notice as he is more qualified than a paramedic and already registered with the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC). ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been running my lab since 5 years. This notice has come as a shocker. My qualification is MBBS and MD. I have an MMC registration number. Legally, I‚Äôm allowed to run a diagnostic laboratory. How can a doctor who is registered with the MMC produce registration from the paramedical council?‚Äù wondered Dr Saklinwar. Dr Sandeep Yadav, president, Maharashtra Association of Practicing Pathologists and Microbiologists (MAPPM), termed the notice ‚Äòbizzare‚Äô. He said the association will protest against such steps. ‚ÄúThe MPC is for lab technicians, but Dr Saklinwar is our member as he is a qualified pathologist. This is like serving a closure notice to a hospital because doctors don‚Äôt have registration of the nursing council,‚Äù he said.  Such notices are being served to some MAPPM members in Maharashtra, either due to lack of awareness of the laws or with the intention to harass qualified pathologists. ‚ÄúOne such notice was served in June. Doctors had submitted their MMC registration documents in return. Government babus sending similar notices is not acceptable,‚Äù said Dr Yadav. The association has claimed that only MD pathology doctors are authorized to run a pathology laboratory in Maharashtra as per the Supreme Court order (2017). Diploma and certificate holder pathologists are considered technicians and they can work in lab but can‚Äôt sign reports. Many labs in Vidarbha are run by non-qualified technicians. The tate should take action against them. ‚ÄúInstead of taking action against unauthorized labs, the state government and district administration are serving notices to qualified doctors which is unfortunate,‚Äù added Dr Yadav. No official from Gadchiroli district administration was available for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/not-registered-with-paramedical-council-md-pathologists-being-served-closure-notices/articleshow/84304263.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC: Woman can appeal POSH panel‚Äôs dismissal of complaint||Mumbai: A woman approached Bombay high court last year with a grievance that since the in-house panel in the company where she worked informed her ‚Äúno action was required‚Äù on her complaint alleging sexual harassment, thereby dismissing it, she had nowhere to turn to. An HC bench of Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Madhav Jamdar, in a July 8 decision, said the woman could file an appeal against the company‚Äôs internal committee (IC) report and order. Under the POSH Act, a complaint is first assessed by an in-house panel which also has a member from an NGO. Her counsel, Mihir Desai, said there was no appellate body set up or notified by the state under the POSH Act or rules and hence she was constrained to approach the HC against the company to quash the IC‚Äôs report and order. She also questioned her subsequent ‚Äúillegal termination‚Äù in June 2020.The company, represented by counsel Birendra Saraf, opposed her petition and also questioned its maintainability given the provisions of the Act.At a hearing on March 11, the state had said the POSH Act, under Section 18 and Rule 11, provides for appeals against the IC report. The HC had directed the state to give details of whether such an appellate authority was set up. On July 8, the state‚Äôs assistant government pleader, Hemant Haryan, informed the HC of its March 31 notification. It made the industrial court in Mumbai the appellate authority in this case, he said.The notification was issued by the state deputy secretary (industries, energy and labour departments) under Section 2 (A) of the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946. The POSH Act‚Äôs Section 18 says any person aggrieved by the report may file an appeal to a tribunal within 90 days.The HC bench did not pass orders on maintainability of her petition or merit and kept all such contentions open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-woman-can-appeal-posh-panels-dismissal-of-complaint/articleshow/84306296.cms||---
---||Chennai||Musicians strike the right note online||CHENNAI: Earlier this week, Sanjay Subrahmanyam posted a short snippet on Instagram. The video begins with an alapanai ‚Äî 23 seconds long and in Mukhari ragam ‚Äî that drenches weary souls in bliss before ending with an anecdote. The story dates to a 1990 concert when a 22-year-old Sanjay broke into an impromptu musical piece that convinced senior critic N M Narayanan ‚Äî known for leaving concerts just before the ‚Äòtani avartanams‚Äô ‚Äî to walk back to his seat and stay for the rest of the show. "These are small victories we savour in our concerts," he ends it. ‚ÄòOn that Note‚Äô is a series of such snippets from Sanjay‚Äôs life. The musician, along with Bhargavii Mani of Edge Design House started creating short episodes for digital audiences at the beginning of last year after the pandemic. Today, it has become a ritual his fans look forward to every week, in a way to get to know him better, begin candid conversations and perhaps become friends. Soon after the pandemic began, concerts were recorded and uploaded online to give audiences their fill in the absence of physical shows. And artists have broken the walls further this year with short, innovative content and talks that take them closer to their fans in a way a coffee table conversation would, albeit virtually. And with newer apps like Clubhouse streamlining these possibilities, they sure are having a lot of fun. "The stories I have been sharing here have been a staple for me at most after-dinner conversations. Close friends and family are familiar with them. I have been able to connect to newer audiences and the feedback has been fantastic," says Sanjay, who has started another series, ‚ÄòShort Notes‚Äô, on similar lines. In recent months, senior dancer Anita Ratnam started using her Instagram handle to talk about everything that constitutes her life beyond dance. She‚Äôs done close to 50 sessions in two-and-a-half months ‚Äî on everything from yoga and nutrition to fashion and leisure. She‚Äôs also taken to Clubhouse every Monday to bring together artist friends from across the globe to talk about their work and life through the pandemic. She says that offering these glimpses into her life has led to "amplifying my interests and engaging with people who interest me." "I‚Äôm doing things I would have never normally thought about, and finding in the process that there is so much more to life," says Anita. "I have a diverse following ‚Äî friends from the corporate world, journalism and the allied arts. I am pleasantly surprised to discover that I enjoy these conversations. I feel engaged and not depressed or yearning to go back on stage. That will happen when it happens." Sudha Raghunathan too has been hosting Clubhouse rooms on various music-related topics for more than a month. She says the sessions have brought her closer to people she may never have known through shows. "I meet artists, writers and journalists and interact with them on various issues, all real-time. It bridges the gap, opens us up to different opinions and leads to vibrant exchange of ideas. There‚Äôs so much creativity that can come out of this."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/musicians-strike-the-right-note-online/articleshow/84304299.cms||Saranya Chakrapani

He also said there was a fear of the Delta plus variant spreading, especially in overcrowded places.People organising weddings should inform the police before the ceremony and adhere to all the terms and conditions like mandatory to wear masks, maintaining social distancing and allowing limited number of guests etc, said Patil. The police patils will visit marriage ceremonies in their respective villages. If any violation is found, the police patils will inform the police for further legal action. Apart from this, the owners of wedding halls and lawns have been asked to use a contactless thermometer to check the body temperature of the guests. The hall owners can purchase and make use of it as it would not be feasible for the hosts to buy the equipment just for the ceremony.SP Patil said strict action will be taken against those who are found not following Covid appropriate behaviour at the wedding venues. The police would be maintaining a strict vigil at wedding ceremonies and other crowded places of the rural areas to stop the spread of Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/police-patils-to-keep-check-on-weddings-in-rural-nashik/articleshow/84300798.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rs 1,200 crore ‚Äòvital‚Äô road repair work on hold, netas cry foul||MUMBAI: A decision to take up Rs. 1200 crores worth of road repair work in the city starting October 2021 has been kept pending. Officials said that as volume of work is huge, they want to moderate the same and decide which needs to be taken up on priority. However, corporators from the opposition party have alleged that BMC is spending ‚Äúlavishly‚Äù on large projects, but essential road work is ignored. TimesViewEvery year, the BMC spends phenomenal amounts on road repairs, but there seems to be little accountability considering the pathetic state of our roads. The administration‚Äôs decision to keep the roads repair proposal pending indicates it wants to conserve its finances considering the huge expenditure it incurred since last year to control the pandemic. However, the corporation must also ensure that crucial road repair work does not suffer.Opposition party corporatorRais Shaikh alleged that BMC invited tenders for repair work months ago, but the final packet of bids was opened two months ago but it is still to bring the proposal for approval in the standing committee. ‚ÄúWhile we see wasteful expenditure in desalination plants at Rs 1,600 crore, BMC is struggling to decide which roads to take up for repairs,‚Äù said Shaikh who has written to BMC chief I S Chahal. Opposition party leader in the BMC, Ravi Raja, meanwhile said that the reason for delay in new road repair contracts seems to be huge expenditure it has already made to tackle the Covid pandemic. ‚Äú...So, it appears that BMC is trying to cut on spending. But road repair is vital and should not suffer,‚Äù said Raja. Sources in the BMC who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that in a run-up to BMC polls 2022, corporators are pushing BMC to take up road works on priority even if it means only making an announcement. A corporator said that BMC cannot reduce the quantum of work this year in any way as the public may think corporators did nothing for the ward. However, additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said that while Rs 1,200 crore worth of works have been tendered, there are other jobs worth Rs 400 crore that are yet to be tendered out. ‚ÄúThe volume of work is not likely to reduce in any way but we only want to moderate the quantum that we may take up as the budget allocation is only of Rs 1,200 crore.

Police ignored all such interventions and went ahead with the autopsy, in which it was revealed that the child was subjected to sexual abuse and murdered. Police have arrested Arjun, 22, a DYFI activist, in connection with the rape and murder of the child. Dr Manu Johns Chowallur, assistant professor and assistant police surgeon, department of forensic medicine, Government medical college, Thrissur, said that autopsy is mustin all unnatural deaths. ‚ÄúThe autopsy report is a statistical evidence to ensure punishment to the accused. As part of the postmortem, the doctor will collect vaginal swabs and smear from the body. Detecting seminal stains and spermatozoa will be a strong evidence in rape cases,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe Kerala medico-legal code and CRPC 174 also clearly say that in all unnatural cases, postmortem is mandatory to find the actual reason of the death,‚Äù he said. An officer who is part of the probe team said that they had doubts about the actual cause of the girl‚Äôs death. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we decided to conduct the postmortem. The postmortem report has entirely changed the case‚Äù he said. Meanwhile, MLA Soman denied the allegations. ‚ÄúAfter the incident, the residents told me that they don‚Äôt want to do an autopsy on the child‚Äôs body. The people living here are culturally opposed to subjecting bodies to postmortem. I had, however, directed the police to take steps as per law,‚Äù Soman said. Idukki DCC president Ibrahimkutty Kallar said that the MLA had behaved irresponsibly and tried to intervene in the investigation. ‚ÄúHow can an MLA make such a request in a case of unnatural death? We suspect that the accused used his political influence to avoid the postmortem,‚Äù Kallar said. Kerala child rights commission chairman K V Manojkumar and BJP MP Suresh Gopi visited the girl‚Äôs family on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/row-over-mlas-intervention-in-child-murder-case/articleshow/84302703.cms||Sandeep Thomas

The earlier one-year suspension he was undergoing had ended on Friday. While his earlier suspension was under the all India services (discipline and appeal) rules, the current one is under sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Sivasankar who was also the principal secretary of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the previous LDF government was suspended from service on July 17, 2020. This came after a three-member committee headed by the then chief secretary Vishwas Mehta found that he had violated the civil service conduct rules. With the suspension period ending on Friday, a high level committee headed by the present chief secretary V P Joy decided to extend the suspension on the basis of the charges framed by the Customs. The committee found that ‚Äúthis officer was under judicial custody, custody of the customs and Enforcement Directorate for more than 100 days in total. He has been charged under sections of Prevention of Money Laundering Act and Customs Act also‚Äù. It has been decided to communicate the decision of the government to the Union department of personal and training, and also to the Union home ministry.

Based on her decision, half of the house was painted in the yellow of Brazil and the other half in light blue and white of Argentina, leaving both ‚Äòteams‚Äô happy. The colours chosen to paint the house in Mallappuzhassery panchayat near Kozhenchery town in Pathanamthitta reveal the ‚Äòhardcore‚Äô commitment of the football-crazy fans in the state. Yesudas Xavier has been an ardent fan of Argentina ever since he started watching Maradona play. ‚ÄúThe Hand of God goal is still fresh in my mind,‚Äù says Xavier about the controversial goal scored by Maradona in the 1986 World Cup. Since the 2006 World Cup, Xavier‚Äôs football frenzy has been whipped up to another level as he started making cut-outs of his favourite Argentine players and even painted his autorickshaw in Albiceleste colours. However, the pandemic restrictions have crashed head-on with the excitement and forced the 51-year-old to cheer for his team from within the confines of his home. The twist in the tale came when Xavier, a painter by profession, decided to paint the Argentina‚Äôs colours. His sons who were die-hard Brazil fans were shocked at their father‚Äôs decision. Jomon, the younger one, spoke with his brother Jojo who is working in Dubai. Noticing her son gloomy, Prema stepped in as a referee and listened to both the parties and announced her decision. She ruled one half of the house can be painted in the colours of Brazil and the other half in the colours of Argentina. The painting was completed 10 days ago and now, both the teams have reached the finals of Copa America. Both the father and the younger son play for the local football club in the panchayat. Jomon, a XII student has played for his school team as well. When they both watch the finals at their home along with friends on Sunday morning Prema has a task cut out for her: To ensure that whoever ends up on the losing side accept defeat with a smile.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/father-sons-show-their-colours-and-mother-steps-in-as-referee/articleshow/84302710.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

This includes labourers from other states engaged in the construction industry,‚Äù he told TOI after assuming charge as the chairman of the board on Friday. The board has 13,41,494 registered members, while around 20 lakh labourers are not registered with the board. ‚ÄúWe will carry out an inquiry to find out the reasons for not registering a large section of workers. Meanwhile, a special drive will be carried out to enrol the unregistered members. We are also taking efforts to simplify online registration,‚Äù he said.The board would insist on employing registered members in all government construction projects in the state. This would ensure insurance cover for the labourers and provide a safety net for their families if the workers meet with any accident, he added. On increasing the financial assistance to members, Kumar said until now, private builders have been paying 1% labour cess, which was used for the welfare of workers. However, it has not been collected from government projects. ‚ÄúFrom now on, we will insist the contractors taking government projects pay the labour cess without fail. This will increase the corpus fund and help us enhance the financial assistance,‚Äù he said.At present, family of a registered member who dies of natural causes is extended an aid of Rs 25,000.

Following the directions from chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday to begin the process of filling up 50,000 vacancies in the first phase, various department heads started identifying the vacancies which would be placed before the state cabinet on July 13. ‚ÄúAbout 20,000 posts of 50,000 vacancies will be from police force, including constables and sub-inspectors, doctors and paramedical staff in health and medical department and teachers in education department. The rest of the vacancies are from 27 departments such as revenue, panchayat raj, municipal administration, irrigation, social welfare and tribal welfare,‚Äù a senior CMO official told STOI. The CM has already announced his plans to strengthen the health department by increasing the staff in various hospitals, including existing and new. There is a severe shortage of paramedical staff at the lower level. Similarly, the government is also planning to allow universities to fill the teachers‚Äô posts soon. Official sources said the revenue department and district administrations will be given top priority in the recruitment drive as many districts have been functioning with meagre staff after the formation of new districts. Some of the staff were told to serve in the new districts. ‚ÄúApart from identifying the posts and financial implications, the state government has to take a decision on the agencies that would be given the task of recruitment as Telangana Public Service Commission alone cannot take up the work.

The directorate has gathered details such as allotted strength, admitted strength, popular courses and courses with fewer admissions from all colleges to prepare for online admissions. As per the announcement by higher education minister K Ponmudi, admission to undergraduate courses will begin from August 1 after the declaration of CBSE and state board Class XII results. ‚ÄúThe DCE is updating the website with details like new colleges and courses for 2021-22. Online applications will be user-friendly and students can fill in the details using their mobile phones,‚Äù sources said. Like last year, there will be a facilitation centre in each district to help the students. Last year, around three lakh applications were received for 89,000 seats in government colleges. The government will conduct counselling for 41 university constituent colleges that have been converted into government colleges. So, there will be around 17,000 additional seats available this year. Students are likely to be allowed to apply to any number of colleges and courses. But, they have to pay a processing fee for each college. The admissions committee will send the details of applications to each course to the concerned college. The college admissions committee will prepare the rank list based on 69% reservation. Students will be intimated about the selection list and they will be admitted after verification of certificates. ‚ÄúStudents need to be allowed to choose a medium of instruction and shift to simplify the admission process. The state government also should think of conducting admissions at regional level to make the online admission process more efficient,‚Äù said T Veeramani, president of TN Government Collegiate Teachers‚Äô Association . Last year, colleges prepared rank lists for BA, BSc and BCom based on the marks scored on four subjects excluding languages.

Before India elects its next president in 2022, there will be assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur. In recent assembly elections in West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the opposition has demonstrated the ability to check the BJP-NDA government, Tewari said on Saturday while participating virtually in a panel discussion on ‚ÄòDoes India Lack an Effective Opposition?‚Äô ‚Äî part of ISB Leadership Summit. ‚ÄúThe national alternative to BJP-NDA will not emerge before May 2023 primarily because some of the major players are people who have state governments to run and the economy is not in the best of shape. Coupled with that, there is abuse and misuse of government instrumentalities...,‚Äù Tiwari said. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena member of Parliament (MP) Priyanka Chaturvedi pointed out that the Maharashtra model, wherein three political parties from different ideological backgrounds (Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP) have come together, offers a good reference point for opposition parties to agree on a common minimum programme and put up a united front. However, AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi said that the need of the hour for the opposition is to have a different ideology from that of the BJP if it wants to connect with the people. ‚ÄúWhat is the difference between non-BJP parties and BJP party?

The list includes revisions to syllabi of subjects such as chemistry, physics, biology etc for ICSE and accounts, commerce, economics, business studies, history, political science for ISC. According to city principals, there has been no change in syllabus for physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics. ‚ÄúConsidering many students appear for competitive exams such as NEET, there was no change in the four core subjects. However, other subjects such as English, accountancy, psychology etc. have had few additions and deletions,‚Äù said Maya Sukumaran, principal of Gitanjali Senior School, adding that the curriculum can be comfortably covered with efforts from all stakeholders. As per analysis made by subject teachers from various schools, genetics topic that was excluded by the CICSE last year has been reintroduced for ICSE students this year. In English, the number of dramas, number of pros and poetry have been revised for both ICSE and ISC students. ‚ÄúFor ICSE students, thoughtful additions have been worked out in physics.

This comes after the directives of the state government to install oxygen tanks to ensure enough oxygen storage to fight the third wave of Covid. MMC has proposed to set up the the LMO tanks at its Jaffar Nagar hospital, which the authorities said will be likely installed in the next one and half months. ‚ÄúThe Jafar Nagar Hospital is nearing completion. We have enough space at the 50-bedded hospital. So we have decided to set up the LMO at the hospital, which will cater to the people there,‚Äù said MMC commissioner Bhalchandra Gosavi. The proposal has been mooted and sent to the district collectorate for its technical sanction, after which the next process for tender to construct the same will be carried out. The second wave has shown how oxygen shortage could risk the lives of many. Therefore, the government has ordered to install the LMO tanks apart from the PSA oxygen plants so that they can be used as a buffer when the need for oxygen arises, Gosavi said.  Malegaon town was a Covid hotspot during the first wave of Covid. The administration had a tough time in curbing the spread, especially when the ways and means to treat the infection were not known. This also resulted in a very high mortality rate during the time. The total number of cases in Malegaon so far is 12,558, including 357 deaths, 12,147 recoveries and 50 active cases.

---||Kochi||Kerala: CPM panel to probe charges raised against G Sudhakaran||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The CPM state committee has appointed a two-member commission to investigate the alleged lapses in the electioneering work in Ambalapuzha constituency, of which senior leader G Sudhakaran was in charge. CPM central committee member Elamaram Kareem and state committee member K J Thomas would probe the veracity of the allegations raised by the CPM Alappuzha district committee that Sudhakaran had not been active in the election work in the constituency. The party candidate H Salam had earlier raised serious allegations against Sudhakaran in the district committee meeting. He had accused Sudhakaran of being disturbingly passive to the smear campaign against him by political opponents. Sudhakaran did not try to defend Salam when he was accused of being an SDPI cadre. The body language of Sudhakaran was too negative and it made the election an unnecessarily strenuous one for the CPM candidate, he had alleged. Though Salam had won the seat which Sudhakaran had been representing consecutively, the victory margin was considerably low. Sudhakaran has not responded publically to the allegations. CPM acting state secretary A Vijayaraghavan told reporters after the two-day state committee meeting here on Saturday that the probe was not against any individual. ‚ÄúThere were some lapses in the election work. The party views such shortcomings work very seriously. There was organisational weakness in some places. Such drawbacks must be analysed and rectified. This is how the party works,‚Äù he said. The party secretary said the state committee has also decided to probe the organisational lapses in the Pala and Kuttiyadi seats where LDF candidates Jose K Mani and M V Sreyams Kumar lost. Kottayam and Wayand district committees would initiate the probe into these failures. To a question, Vijayaraghavan said Kozhikode district committee has already taken appropriate steps in connection with the election in Kuttiyadi seat. To a question, Vijayaraghavan said the party would provide enough political education to party MLAs who have sworn in the name of god. ‚ÄúState committee has decided to step up the party education. Political and organisational lapses would be addressed. Steps would be taken to foster rationale thinking and scientific temper,‚Äù he said. Some of the party MLAs, including health minister Veena George had taken the oath in the name of god, a practice which Communists abhorred till recently.

The Bihar Military Police (BMP) jawans deputed at the shrine will be imparted training at par with Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel. The BMP jawans will be deputed in two-kilometre radius of the Mahavihara. Ever since the serial bomb blasts in Bodh Gaya on July 7, 2013, security at the Mahavihara has been enhanced. There is a ban on entry with any electronic gadget. Every nook and corner of the shrine campus has been covered with night vision high resolution closed-circuit television cameras (CCTVs). The existing 90 CCTVs will also be upgraded. These decisions were taken following the two-day security review of the Mahavihara by special branch additional director general (ADG) Bachchu Singh Meena on Thursday and Friday. A blueprint for the enhanced security arrangements will be prepared within a week. Intelligence sleuths, BMP and the district police personnel will be maintaining extra vigil in the no-entry zone around the Mahavihara for vehicular traffic. Gaya SSP Aditya Kumar said the ADG reviewed the compliance of earlier decisions regarding security at the Mahavihara. ‚ÄúSome decisions have been taken to further strengthen the security. The CCTVs installed on the campus are 4 to 5-year-old. Hence, the CCTVs will be upgraded with latest technology.

---||Chennai||Meet the wordly wise||CHENNAI: For Japanese language learners in Tamil Nadu, employment is the driving force behind their desire for fluency. For the Korean language learners, it‚Äôs entertainment ‚Äî K-pop, K-cosmetics, K-food, K-cool are hotter than ever now. Meanwhile, those waitlisted for emigration to Canada are using the time indoors to fast-track their French. Whatever the reasons, language learning has seen a spike in the past year-and-a-half of the lockdown. In its 2020 report, language learning app Duolingo said more than 30 million people started learning a language on the app in the weeks following the outbreak of the pandemic (March-April), which was 70% more than during the same period in 2019. Software engineer Shankara Narayanan from Salem was one of those new learners. His language of choice ‚Äî Japanese. "I completed one part of the course last year and its corresponding exam in December," says the 22-year-old who has wasted no time since then in his job search. "Employers in Japan are more responsive because I know the basics of the language. In terms of a salary, I know I can earn at least 80% more than in India," says Narayanan. Anuradha Rajasekaran, director at ABK-AOTS DOSOKAI, the oldest Japanese language school in south India, says in the four decades since its establishment, the largest number of enrolments has been in the past year. "The external affairs ministry reached out to Japanese schools across the country recently and highlighted the fact that 3.5 lakh people are required in Japan for jobs ranging from nursing to farming as the country has an aging population," says Rajasekaran. "Our biggest surprise was the interest we are seeing from the semi-urban areas, the reason being that with the classes online, more people have the opportunity to learn." At the INKO Centre, where Korean is taught, director Rathi Jaffer says they have a waiting list of 300 for the online language classes. "While a few years ago, learning Korean was linked to employability on account of the plethora of Korean companies in the city, nowadays it‚Äôs to do with the popularity of K-pop, K-fashion, K-food, K-drama and so on," says Jaffer. From rural Tamil Nadu, several states in the northeast and Kashmir, it‚Äôs a K-plosion of interest. For the past decade, ever since she got hooked to K-dramas, Shangavi Sundar has been yearning to learn Korean. "I never had the chance because the classes were in Chennai," says the 26-year-old civil engineer from Cuddalore. But within a couple of months of the Covid-19 lockdown, she signed up with Inko for online classes in the language. "It‚Äôs been a year. I‚Äôm thinking of switching careers and becoming an interpreter," she says. Sprachlingua, another language school in the city, which focuses on the more practical aspects of language learning such as business communication, says French and Spanish have seen an uptake during the lockdown. German and Chinese seeing the least number of takers, although the numbers here are also slowly climbing, says Sreeram Mahaalingam, co-founder of the school. ‚ÄúWith executives not being able to travel, client management takes place over emails and phone calls. That‚Äôs the reason we have a number of working professionals reaching out to learn languages,‚Äù adds Sudha Suresh, another co-founder. She says that several emigrants to Canada had enrolled for French classes while waiting for their visas to come through. As for intrepid Japanese language learner Narayanan, with a job on the horizon, he says he has moved on to researching Japanese culture and cuisine. "I now need to know vegetarian food options in Japan."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/meet-the-wordly-wise/articleshow/84304481.cms||Kamini Mathai

The hike comes into effect from July 11. Amul had raised milk prices by Rs 2 on July 1 citing increased input costs like energy, packaging and logistics. On Saturday, Mother Dairy said that procurement cost of milk from dairy farmers has gone up by 8-10% in the last one year. Other operational costs have also risen, necessitating the retail hike. However, the head of Maharashtra's dairy major Gokul milk cooperative Satej Patil, who is also minister of state for home, attributed the price rise to a hike in procurement costs. Buffalo milk has been increased from Rs 58 to Rs 60, cow milk from Rs 47 to Rs 49. A press release issued by Gokul on Saturday said it was ameliorating the fortunes of its dairy farmers. ‚ÄúAs assured soon after being elected to the board of the Kolhapur District Co-Operative Milk Producers' Union, which owns Gokul, we have announced a hike in procurement price by Rs 2 for buffalo milk and Re 1 for cow milk from July 11.

The district had recorded 9,928 Covid cases among the minors in May. This number fell to 2,210 in June. Like in May, the bulk of the patients were asymptomatic and did not require hospitalization in June too. The paediatric taskforce of the state government had taken note of the high number of minors being infected in Ahmednagar in May. According to the data provided by the district health authorities in June, 436 children aged up to 6 years, 710 aged between 7-12 and 1,146 aged between 11-18 years were infected. In May, Ahmednagar district had a total of around 86,000 Covid cases, while in June the number came down to 17,719. The district‚Äôs positivity rate, which was over 22% in May, declined to around 16% in June. Bhosale said although there is a vast improvement on the Covid front, the situation in three talukas ‚Äî Parner, Pathardi and Srigonda ‚Äî is still a bit worrisome as active cases are not declining. The administration is taking measures in those three talukas to bring down the cases. Secretary of the district taskforce Dr Sachin Solat said that the virus had become less virulent in June. ‚ÄúThis is one of the reasons why fewer people, including minors, were infected in June. But people should not be complacent and avoid violating the Covid norms as there is a prediction of a third wave,‚Äù he added. Dr Solat, who is also a paediatrician at the Ahmednagar civil hospital, said that in June, the hospital had treated only seven Covid-infected minors aged between 5 and 17 years.

The India Meteorological Department has accordingly placed Delhi in the ‚Äòlarge deficient‚Äô area category. While five of nine districts are in a deficient rainfall category, four suffered a large deficiency. The city has so far received only 44.1mm of rain since June 1 against the normal mark of 114.2mm. IMD data shows that North district has so far fared the best in terms of precipitation, receiving 78mm of rainfall between June 1 and July 10. However, the normal mark for the district until July 10 is 103.3mm, therefore, placing it at a deficit of 25%. The Central district has fared the worst, receiving just 8.5mm of rainfall during this period compared with the normal of 118.9mm, indicating a deficit of 93%. IMD classifies rainfall as ‚Äòdeficit‚Äô when the precipitation is 19% or more below the normal and ‚Äòlarge deficit‚Äô or ‚Äòlarge deficient‚Äô when this figure is more than -59%. Between -19% and 19% of the normal, the rainfall is classified as ‚Äònormal‚Äô and between 20% and 59% as ‚Äòexcess‚Äô. The other districts in the large deficient category are North-East (-65%), South (-79%) and South-West (-70%), these having barely received any rain, even during the recent wet spells. Met officials, however, explained that anomalies in the distribution of rainfall, especially before the arrival of the monsoon rains, was common and the distribution of rainfall stabilised once the monsoon showers hit the city. ‚ÄúWhen the rainy season starts, the spread will be more even and the deficits will likely be bridged. Good rainfall is expected this week, and this should lead to the reduction of the overall deficit. A delay of around two weeks in the monsoons reaching Delhi caused this deficit to build up,‚Äù said an official. Last year, Delhi had a head start on June 25 with the monsoon hitting the capital two days before the scheduled arrival. IMD officials said that though the monsoon may arrive early, Delhi starts receiving spells of moderate to heavy rainfall consistently only towards the end of July and in August. ‚ÄúDelhi has a small area, so some parts may not receive rainfall at all during certain spells. Significant changes will be seen once heavy rainfall occurs, which generally happens towards the end of July and in August,‚Äù said the official.

---||Lucknow||Allahabad HC upholds death for man who killed wife, four daughters||LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court has affirmed the death penalty awarded to a man from Lakhimpur Kheri convicted for the murder of his wife and four minor daughters. The court declined his appeal and plea to mitigate the sentence after finding that the prosecution successfully established the chain of circumstances. They were found to be conclusive and excluded all hypothesis except the fact that it was the convicted man alone who is guilty. Holding that there is no chance of reformation of the man, the bench of Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Rajeev Singh said, ‚ÄúWe find there is ample evidence to establish that the man committed pre-planned and pre-meditated murder of his wife and minor innocent children.‚Äù The accused cut the body of the deceased and inflicted severe incised wounds on them. Thus, it is beyond doubt that the manner in which crime was committed using a banka (sharp-edged weapon) and thereafter bodies were burnt by pouring kerosene oil, was brutal, cruel and gruesome, the court said. The bench passed the judgment accepting the reference of the trial court to confirm the capital sentence already awarded to the man in 2016 and dismissing his appeal. Sessions judge Lakhimpur Kheri had on November 4, 2016 convicted and sentenced accused Rama Nand with death penalty for killing wife Sangeeta and four children in 2010. Sangeeta‚Äôs brother had lodged the FIR. Opposing the plea of the convict, government advocate Vimal Kumar Srivastava submitted that he had confessed his guilt to two prosecution witnesses and banka and blood-stained clothes were recovered. Nand‚Äôs story that some unknown miscreants had killed his wife and children was found false. Srivastava elaborated that Bharti had developed illicit relations with another woman of the village and she had become pregnant so he wanted to get rid of his wife and daughters. He had sent his 10-year-old son to another place a week before the incident, wrote the bench in the verdict. Earlier, arguing for the convicted person, amicus curie Rajesh Kumar Dwivedi had pleaded that it was a case of circumstantial evidence and the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond doubt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-upholds-death-for-man-who-killed-wife-4-daughters/articleshow/84306520.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya
---||Hyderabad||Telangana cops slap PD Act to keep accused in jail after bail||HYDERABAD: A day after the Supreme Court questioned Telangana‚Äôs use of the ‚Äòdraconian‚Äô Prevention of Dangerous Activities (PD) Act, TOI found that nearly 350 people across the state had the Act invoked against them in 2020. Of these, 267 were from the three commissionerates in the capital city - Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda. There are also allegations that the Act is used to keep accused in jail for long periods even after they get bail. Meet Salman Khan, a resident of Humayun Nagar, who was arrested in July 2020 along with a friend. The two were accused of cheating by the Hyderabad police in five different cases. Despite Salman getting bail in all cases, he is still behind bars as the PD Act was invoked against him after he was released from jail. The Supreme Court had on Friday served notice to Telangana government and questioned the 1986 Act after a woman challenged its invoking against her husband by Telangana police. While issuing notice, the top court said it was surprised no one had challenged the Act all these years. People like Salman‚Äôs father, Hakeem Khan, a businessman, feel that PD Act should be used only against those who are involved in murder, attempt to rape, dacoity and other serious offences as the accused pose threat to society. It should not be invoked against accused facing charges like cheating and white-collar offences. ‚ÄúExcept in the case filed against my son at the Chandrayangutta police station, the other four cases were filed without any evidence,‚Äù Khan claimed. ‚ÄúIt has become common practice for police to file multiple cases just to create grounds for invoking the PD Act.‚Äù Take the case of an astrologer in Nalgonda district who obtained bail in four cheating cases after being in jail. However, for the past three months, he is still in jail as the PD Act has been slapped on him. Senior criminal lawyer Muzafarullah Khan said the Act should be invoked only if there is a disturbance to public order and also cited an instance where in it was invoked against a person, who is accused of stealing two vehicles. ‚ÄúThere is a difference between law and order and public order,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAs far as disturbance to public order is concerned, a large section of society should be affected. Using the PD Act against an accused who has already obtained bail, is violation of his right to freedom and right to obtain bail. Police have been invoking the PD Act based on assumptions and presumptions. Instead of using the Act, the police should seek cancellation of bail if the accused repeats an offence in violation of bail conditions.‚Äù A senior Telangana police officer told TOI, ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court has not taken an objection to the law. The judges have sought an affidavit, which is a legal procedure. With regard to the observation that it is a draconian law, it is for Parliament, assembly and the Supreme Court to decide whether it should be changed or scrapped. The police only implement the law.‚Äù Police claim that ‚Äòaggressive invocation‚Äô of the PD Act since 2014-15 had resulted in a drastic fall in the crime rate in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-cops-slap-pd-act-to-keep-accused-in-jail-after-bail/articleshow/84306542.cms||Srinath Vudali

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: The importance of being Kalyan Singh in poll year||LUCKNOW: On the evening of July 8, BJP national president JP Nadda and party national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh flew down to Lucknow for a very special purpose ‚Äî to meet a frail and ailing former UP chief minister Kalyan Singh, recuperating at the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS). The two top BJP leaders headed back to Delhi immediately without having any political engagements with the party brass in the state. This was two days after PM Narendra Modi took out time from his busy schedule ‚Äî which also included effecting a cabinet reshuffle a day later ‚Äî to call up Kalyan‚Äôs son Rajveer Singh to enquire about his father‚Äôs health. The same day, CM Yogi rushed to PGI to meet Kalyan, fondly known as ‚ÄòBabuji‚Äô. Yogi again paid a visit to meet Kalyan along with his two deputies ‚Äî Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma ‚Äî when Nadda and Santhosh reached Lucknow. On Friday, Modi again called up Kalyan‚Äôs grandson, Sandeep to know about his grandfather‚Äôs well being. The PM then tweeted: ‚ÄúI am deeply touched that during his conversation with Nadda ji, Kalyan Singh ji remembered me. I also have many memories of my interactions with Kalyan Singh ji. Several of those memories came back to life. Talking to him has always been a learning experience.‚Äù In another tweet, Modi said: ‚ÄúCountless people across India are praying for speedy recovery of Kalyan Singh ji...‚Äù While Modi‚Äôs personal outreach to enquire about Kalyan‚Äôs health and visits by other senior BJP leaders were accounted as courtesy calls, experts did not miss the chance to read into the deeply embedded message ‚Äî Kalyan‚Äôs close association with the Ram Temple movement, which helped BJP rise powerfully in country‚Äôs most politically crucial state of UP in early 1990s. The issue has gained all the more prominence with the construction of Ram Temple turning into a reality even as UP heads for a high stake UP assembly election due next year. In fact, during his first tenure as UP CM, Kalyan attained the sobriquet of ‚ÄòHindu Hriday Samrat‚Äô after a frenzied mob of ‚ÄòKar Sewaks‚Äô hammered down the disputed Babri mosque in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992. A senior BJP leader recalled how Kalyan became one of the most prominent faces of the party in UP at the peak of Ram Temple movement which attained decisive traction after BJP stalwart Lal Krishna Advani embarked on a Ram Rath Yatra. It was a huge political move of the saffron party to consolidate Hindu community which got divided in the wake of implementation of Mandal Commission report ‚Äî envisaging 27% reservation to the OBC ‚Äî by the National Front government led by Vishwanath Pratap Singh at the Centre in 1991. The man behind managing the Rath Yatra was none other than Modi. Not surprising, the political scales of BJP soared from 57 seats in 1989 to 221 in 1991 in the undivided UP which then had 425 assembly seats. BJP strength kept flickering at 177 in 1993 and 174 in 1996 despite the strong emergence of two regional satraps ‚Äî the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/the-importance-of-being-kalyan-singh-in-poll-year/articleshow/84306557.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Hyderabad||Y Sujana Chowdary shell firms duped banks of Rs 5,000 crore: CBI to Telangana HC||HYDERABAD: The CBI has claimed in the Telangana high court that scores of shell companies controlled by Rajya Sabha member Y Sujana Chowdary had duped banks of Rs 5,000 crore, and that issuing a lookout circular against him was in the interests of the nation. Sujana has not yet been made an accused in the case. The CBI‚Äôs statements came while Justice K Lakshman was hearing a petition filed by Sujana on Friday challenging the lookout circular against him. He was also seeking, as interim relief, permission to visit the United States on a business trip for the procurement of oxygen concentrators. The judge, while giving the MP a month to complete his US trip, asked him to report to the authorities both before and after his visit there. The CBI said in an affidavit that the role of the MP was under the active consideration of investigators. ‚ÄúLookout circulars are issued against economic offenders who cause immense loss to the national exchequer, to prevent them from fleeing the country,‚Äù CBI officials said in their counter. The judge said he would examine on August 17 the contentions of the MP against the lookout circular since he had not yet been made an accused in the case. ‚ÄúIn the meantime, let him go abroad and come back within a month from now,‚Äù the judge said. According to the CBI counter, a Chennai-based company called Best & Crompton Engineering Projects Ltd and its directors and officials availed of a letter of credit facility from the banks under the pretext of undertaking government projects. The loans generated were directed to various shell companies that have no business at all and were never spent for the specified purposes, the CBI claimed. Most of these shell companies were traced to the Sujana Group head office in Hyderabad from where 278 rubber seals of these shell companies were seized. ‚ÄúAll the shell companies were used to show circular trading and they had also shown some transactions with Best and Crompton,‚Äù the CBI claimed. The probe agency also said that it seized several ‚Äòincriminating‚Äô documents from the Jubilee Hills residence of Sujana. The MP is a director in some of the companies, like Splendid Metals Company, Sujana Towers Ltd, and Sujana Universal Industries. All these companies face allegations of raising false invoices. ‚ÄúThese companies are using the lockdown period as an opportunity and evading investigators. We will soon confront the MP with the material we collected in respect of defrauding the banks. We have not yet made him an accused but we have collected crucial evidence,‚Äù CBI officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sujana-shell-firms-duped-banks-of-rs-5k-cr-cbi-to-hc/articleshow/84306583.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Hosp told to pay Rs 3.5L to woman who broke ankle in wheelchair accident||Mumbai: Upholding a state commission‚Äôs 2019 order, the National Consumer Commission this week ordered Mahim-based P D Hinduja National Hospital to pay a patient Rs 3.5 lakh compensation after she broke her ankle in a wheelchair accident when she returned to the hospital for a check-up after a successful spinal surgery in 2012. The Andheri-based woman, Harsha Lala, was being taken to the OPD from the gate in a wheelchair handled by the hospital security guard when she fell on the ramp. The national commission observed that most wheelchair injuries happen in a medical setting due to the negligence of medical staff, and they could easily be prevented by the hospital or nursing home. ‚ÄúAs a word of caution, in my view, the hospital authority should make systemic improvement in their administration and their grievance redressal mechanism to ensure the patient‚Äôs safety and to maintain good doctor-relationship,‚Äù presiding member Dr S M Kantikar said. The commission further said in this case, the patient underwent mental agony and physical trauma, hence quantum of award decided by the state commission appears just and equitable. ‚ÄúNo palpable crucial error in appreciating the evidence by the two fora below, as may cause to require‚Ä¶ re-appreciation‚Ä¶. No jurisdictional error, or legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice, is visible,‚Äù the state commission said. Lala arrived at the hospital on October 9, 2012 for a follow-up check-up. She had undergone a spinal surgery in the last week of September 2012. It was alleged that she was very rashly and negligently wheeled from the hospital corridor on to the ramp by an unidentified security guard. The security guard did not fasten the seat belt. As a result, Lala suffered a ‚Äòhead-on fall‚Äô from the wheelchair and sustained a fracture in the left ankle. She further alleged that immediate first aid was not given and she was made to stand in queue for payment of X-ray charges, which caused further pain and agony. Lala claimed the incident was immediately reported to the hospital authorities, but to no avail. The hospital denied the allegations and said the junior doctor attended to Lala immediately. The treating doctor ruled out any fracture and assessed that it was only a swelling around the ankle joint. The hospital said Lala was treated as per standards. It called the claim imaginary and highly exaggerated.Lala moved the district forum in 2014. In 2015, it directed the hospital to pay compensation of Rs 1 lakh. The hospital moved Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in 2016, which enhanced compensation. Aggrieved, the hospital then moved the national commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hosp-told-to-pay-rs-3-5l-to-woman-who-broke-ankle-in-wheelchair-accident/articleshow/84306553.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Thankfully, there was no traffic in the morning.‚Äù The vegetable-laden truck was heading to Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Satara/Sangli areas. The vegetables laid scattered on the service lane after the accident. Gheware said, ‚ÄúThe drivers of all the damaged vehicles had stopped on the service lane to have tea. Most of their occupants were also out to have a cuppa. Else, the casualties could have been more.‚Äù Injured autorickshaw driver Suresh Phalke of Narhe said, ‚ÄúThe truck came from the rear and hit my autorickshaw. It brushed against my hand, but I could save myself.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pedestrian-killed-5-hurt-as-truck-ploughs-through-eight-vehicles/articleshow/84304644.cms||---

While many stores have shut shop, others have shifted to other places. Traders say Bypass Road, Anna Nagar, Bibikulam, KK Nagar and Narayanapuram are emerging as alternative commercial hubs. Ashraf Tayub, secretary of Textile Merchants Association, said commercial spaces in and around Vilakkuthoon used to be taken as soon as they were vacant, but they now wait for a long time to find takers. He says the cost of running the stores is the major deterrent because ‚Äúrents have not come down in tune with the slump in business activities in the core commercial areas.‚Äù‚ÄúMany in the textile field are running their businesses just for the sake of it as they were passed on to them for generations. Those who are starting new stores are looking for areas such as Bibikulam and Narayanapuram where the rents are comparatively less,‚Äù he said.Indeed there are other reasons too for the areas around Meenakshi Amman Temple losing their sheen. Restriction in vehicle movement brought in by the city police is one such, causing loss of business for many wholesale shops in Masi Streets. Textiles, utensils, electricals, electronics and ceramic wares being the key business in these streets, many including ornamental lighting stores have shifted to other places. Many foodgrain merchants in East Masi Street, the most affected, have shifted to other areas while others are also contemplating to shift at the earliest. Traders say businesses had started taking a hit ever since Madurai corporation took up smart city works in Masi Streets and the pandemic only made it worse. Although road works have been completed, it did not bring any relief as water logging continues due to poor drainage design, they say. President of Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industries N Jegadeesan said parking has become a major issue in core city as the streets are short of space. Customers want vehicles to be parked right in front of the shops as it is convenient. Many traders are looking to establish stores with parking facilities, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/high-rentals-nagging-smartcity-work-force-traders-in-madurai-city-to-shift/articleshow/84304670.cms||V Devanathan

---||Aurangabad||HC discharges man booked for ‚Äòharbouring‚Äô suspects planning dacoity||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has discharged a former councillor of Chalisgaon who had been booked and chargesheeted for ‚Äúharbouring‚Äù suspects planning to commit dacoity. Currently, the former councillor has been named as an accused in the chargesheet before the Chalisgaon-based sessions court and is facing a trial. He moved an application before the HC seeking discharge, which the HC has allowed. While discharging Mahendra More ‚Äî the 12th accused in the FIR dated September 28, 2016 at Chalisgaon city police station ‚Äî Justice RG Avachat observed: ‚ÄúThe applicant was found in constant contact with accused number four Vishal Salve. Based on the CDR and statement of Ajay More, it is just difficult to observe that the applicant/accused had knowledge or reason to believe that the accused numbers 1 to 10 were about to commit robbery/dacoity and he has harboured them with the intention of facilitating the commission of such robbery/dacoity.‚Äù In the complaint lodged by the police sub-inspector, it was alleged that on September 28, 2016, the counting of votes for the municipal council elections was scheduled. While on bandobast duty, the police team received a tip-off that 10 suspects, with the intention to commit dacoity, were staying in rooms 101 and 116 of the Hotel Bridge Corner. Accordingly, a team led by an assistant-inspector rank officer raided the hotel and the suspects were nabbed. Police also found that one of the accused had a loaded country-made firearm and there were chilli powder packets, rope and iron rods, apparently indicating that they were planning to commit dacoity. During the probe, hotel employee Ajay More told the police that the suspects had claimed of being guests of Mahendra More. On checking the call records, it was found that the former councillor had had several calls with one of the accused named Vishal Salve. Lawyer SP Bharme said More has been implicated merely on the basis of suspicion. He pointed out that one of the accused staying in the hotel was a relative and they were in touch with each other. He said there was nothing more than call detail records between the two. Taking cognizance of the statements of the witnesses on record, the HC observed that neither the hotel owner nor the hotel staffer said the former councillor had called them seeking a favour to accommodate the suspects, and concluded: ‚ÄúThe aforesaid material is grossly inadequate to connect the applicant/accused with the offence (section 216-A of the IPC) with which he is sought to be charged.‚Äù The learned additional sessions judge did not give cogent reasons in support of the impugned order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-discharges-man-booked-for-harbouring-suspects-planning-dacoity/articleshow/84301143.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The usage of the term has left environmentalists ‚Äúshocked‚Äù. While government agencies have been spending crores to conserve and beautify river Waldhuni, MMRDA‚Äôs faux pas in the nomenclature has even left locals bitter.TOI‚Äôs attempts to get an explanation from MMRDA in this regard proved futile.The Waldhuni originates from Ambernath hills, flowing through Ambernath, Ulhasnagar and Kalyan.MMRDA‚Äôs regional plan includes river conservation, development of river banks, green belts and recreation centres. Environmentalists said the Waldhuni is in urgent need of conservation. MMRDA has submitted a blueprint for development of Mumbai metropolitan region by 2036 and the administration has proposed measures to prevent pollution and conserve the environment. An NGO, Vanshakti, had moved Supreme Court in connection with river Waldhuni. The top court had last year pulled up the state government for failing to address water pollution in Waldhuni and Ulhas rivers. Stalin D, founder of Vanshakti, said, ‚ÄúIt is shocking... At the next hearing, likely in two weeks, we‚Äôll inform the Supreme Court about MMRDA‚Äôs act‚Äù.Activist Ashwin Aghor said, ‚ÄúIt could be a move to benefit chemical units at MIDC in Ambernath.

They said they had a good supply of flowers during the lockdown, and a kilogram of jasmine sold for only Rs 200/kg, and now it is selling at Rs 700/kg, but there are no flowers. The president of the Madurai Meenakshi Flower Market, S Ramachandran, said that the traders had been waiting for temples to reopen as there was a huge supply of jasmines. ‚ÄúTen days ago, we had a daily supply of 25 tonnes of jasmines. But now the prices have increased to Rs 700, but we got only two tonnes of flowers on Saturday,‚Äô‚Äô he said. Rain has resulted in the jasmine buds turning soggy and falling off the plants. If there was no rain, we would have sold the buds for not less than Rs400/kg this week, said Perumal, a farmer from Thirumangalam. He has not been able to pluck flowers because the rain had damaged the flowers. Ramachandran says that the uncertainty during the lockdown has led to this situation. Farmers usually prune and maintain the crops for this season, ‚ÄúBut this year, it was not done due to heavy losses and now they are incurring more losses because there are no flowers,‚Äù he said. Usually, this is the season and flowering is also at its peak. ‚ÄúThe month of Aadi is the time when jasmines are sold in large quantities to the temples as people make offerings with just jasmine flowers. But this year, there will be no flowers for two weeks from now,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/flower-traders-farmers-hit-as-rain-damages-jasmine-buds/articleshow/84304707.cms||---

Usually, the mangoes get out of the market by the first week of July when the majority of the places in Uttar Pradesh start getting monsoon rainfall. But this year, due to delayed monsoon, the season for the mangoes has extended as good quality of mangoes of all varieties are available in the market at cheaper prices. Wholesale traders of Muhana Mandi on Thursday stated that mangoes would be available till July 20. This year ample varieties from UP and Gujarat, including Dusseri, Langra and Chausa, was available in Jaipur markets. Since monsoon has been weak so far, it has saved mango crops. Wholesale sellers at Muhana Mandi are getting truckloads of mangoes on a regular basis which has led to cheaper prices and its availability in the market. ‚ÄúSince there is a delayed monsoon, production of mangoes is good. Rainfall damages mangoes and affects their taste. This is the reason why we are getting good quantity of Dusseri, Langra and Chausa variety of mangoes,‚Äù said Kisan Lal Saini, a wholesale dealer of mangoes at Muhana Mandi. Traders mentioned that Dusseri variety of mangoes from Malihabad, Rampur and Lucknow in UP are coming in large numbers which the reason why its prices are comparatively cheaper this year. ‚ÄúIn wholesale market, we are selling in Rs 35 to Rs 45 per kg which is available in Rs 50 to Rs 60 per kg for retail customers. People are buying boxes of 10kg Dusseri mangoes which are available in Rs 400 to Rs 480 depending on the size of mangoes,‚Äù said Mahesh Harsadani, a wholesale trader at the Mohana Mandi.

---||Pune||Beware of fake texts, posts linked to vaccine drives||Pune: Authorities have asked citizens to ignore a message, which claims answering a call from ‚Äò912250041117‚Äô could lead to phone hacking. Police officials in Telangana, who had investigated the claim, said "no such number exists". Fake or unverified messages have been on the rise during the pandemic. Experts have urged citizens to be cautious. In May, cybersecurity firm ESET issued a specific warning for India saying fake messages, linked to Covid1-9 vaccination, were sneaking malware into mobile phones. "Android SMS worm tries to spread via text messages as fake free registration for Covid-19 vaccine - targets India. It can spread itself via SMS to victim contacts with link to download this malware," said ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko in a tweet. Citizens have been submitting such messages to the Times Verified service for checks. Since its launch on April 30, Times Verified has helped bust nearly 800 fake messages linked to the pandemic ‚Äî everything from vaccine-triggered "human magnetism" to the existence of a global cabal that's attempting "population control" through the jabs. Scientists from around the world have said that such messages should not be trusted. The experts have also asked citizens to rely on reliable news outlets and scientific organisations to avoid falling prey to fake claims, which can derail public health measures. One study found that the single largest category of misleading or false claims (39%) are "mischaracterizations or misleading messages about actions or policies of public authorities".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/beware-of-fake-texts-posts-linked-to-vaccine-drives/articleshow/84304765.cms||---
---||Pune||Makeup trends change in keeping with WFH routine and pandemic protocol||PUNE: Protocols in place during the pandemic have resulted in a change in makeup trends. From the obvious dip in demand for lipstick due to mandatory wearing of masks outdoors to the need for quick-fix skincare with the implementation of work from home, there has been a paradigm shift in makeup trends to suit the indoor lifestyle. Makeup artist Monalisa Banerjee pointed out that makeup trends have adapted to the pros and cons of staying at home. ‚ÄúMany people are having problems with sleep and end up with dark circles. Stress can manifest on your skin in various ways. To hide such problems, concealers are doing well and there is also a greater focus on eye makeup,‚Äù she said. HR professional Anuja Chandani, who has been working from home, said, ‚ÄúI have a weakness for lipsticks but I have not bought even a single new one since the pandemic began. My makeup bag has so many products that have hardly been used since last year. Even though I put on makeup on days when I have to attend online meetings, I use less than what I would have to if I stepped out.‚Äù Industry experts say that while skincare products contributed to 12% of pre-Covid sales, it has increased to 20% during the last 15 months. Priti Dalley, a college student, said that glittery and glossy products have taken a back seat. ‚ÄúThe last few years have been about pop colours ‚Äî fuchsia, reds and so on ‚Äî but now it‚Äôs all about being naturally radiant. You don‚Äôt want to go overboard for online meetings because you are attending it from your own home after all.‚Äù With everyone spending more time in front of gadgets, beauty brands have also launched products that claim to block the negative effects of blue light radiation on skin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/makeup-trends-change-in-keeping-with-wfh-routine-and-pandemic-protocol/articleshow/84304756.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP puts CM Yogi Adityanath at forefront of victory march||LUCKNOW: Even as poll results of block chairman elections projected landslide victory of BJP-supported candidates on Saturday evening, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath reached the party‚Äôs state headquarters along with his deputy Dinesh Sharma and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh. The development raised much curiosity in the political circles and was seen as the party‚Äôs bid to put Yogi on the forefront of the electoral success in the rural bodies‚Äô polls which were being projected as a key pointer to the saffron party‚Äôs electoral prospects in the high stake UP assembly elections due next year. On July 3, Swatantra Dev had reached Yogi‚Äôs official residence to congratulate him when party-supported candidates registered a landslide victory in Zila Panchayat chairman elections. On Saturday, Yogi was quick to maintain that the victory in the rural polls were a reflection of people‚Äôs mandate on PM Narendra Modi‚Äôs policy of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas Sabka Vishwas. He said that it was also a stamp on policies of the Centre and the state government and a robust law and order situation in the state. ‚ÄúIt was unlike in the previous regimes when anarchy prevailed and criminals held sway,‚Äù he said. Significantly, the block pramukh polling got marred by reports of violence stemming from clashes between BJP and the Samajwadi Party workers in various parts of the state. Yogi maintained that rural development was at the focus of the state government‚Äôs development agenda and the rural local bodies would contribute their bit in achieving the goal. He said he hoped that the three tier rural local bodies would further strengthen the Panchayati Raj system. Held in the middle of pandemic, Yogi largely remained away from the three-tier rural local bodies‚Äô elections for members which were seen as a litmus test for the BJP even as an aggressive opposition sought to push the ruling party to the wall accusing it of mishandling the Covid crisis. While Yogi himself got infected by the virus, the party‚Äôs leaders took charge of the rural polls by rolling out its well-oiled organisational machinery in rural swathes. The party organisation was helped by UP ministers who were assigned different districts and asked to act as a key link between the party and government. The BJP, however, faced a formidable challenge from the opposition, essentially the Akhilesh Yadav led Samajwadi Party, in the ward level elections in many key districts including Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Ayodhya and Mathura.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-puts-yogi-at-forefront-of-victory-march/articleshow/84306694.cms||Pankaj Shah

Two representatives from Delhi Jal Board, however, participated in the meeting and noted down the problems people raised. A group of locals who joined the meeting shared their water-related problems.

An official said, ‚ÄúThe incident occurred on July 3 following which an investigation was started. The safari vehicles were captured on CCTV camera. Also forest guards were quizzed about the incident. After considering all the facts, the vehicles entry was banned on Friday.‚Äù Sources said the tourists allegedly entered the zone in connivance with the forest staff and people who were facilitating the safari. The administration should take action and set an example to discourage such practice. ‚ÄúThe tourists had a sighting for more than an hour. The forest staff was either ignorant or hand-in-glove with the violators. Also strict action should be taken against the nature guide and gypsy driver to instil discipline.‚Äù A senior forest official said many tourists travelling to forests in India are a threat to wildlife and ecosystem as they are ‚Äúirresponsible‚Äù. ‚ÄúThey do not want to return disappointed, so they pay to lure guides and gypsy drivers to help them in getting the perfect sighting.‚Äù The Ranthambore administration swung into action and took the matter seriously claiming disclosing tigress‚Äô location with cubs can also be dangerous. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) earlier had cautioned all tiger states in India and their chief wildlife wardens to take steps and prevent circulation of tiger photos on social media apps and sites. ‚ÄúSuch information in the public domain has the potential to be used for committing wildlife crimes including poaching,‚Äù said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-safari-vehicles-banned-in-rbore-for-violating-norms/articleshow/84304772.cms||---

It is not known if this is a part of a ring well or grain storing unit, as it has many layers.Archaeology minister Thangam Thennarasu mentioned on social media that another interesting artefact, a container with designs was the latest find, and added that Keeladi continues to be a treasure trove that intrigues many.This container is 77cm in diameter, and has a two centimeter thick rim. The decorations on the container have attracted the attention of archaeologists. It has depressions such as thumb impressions and another has a band which has been equally divided into small squares, with deep lines in between. Both the decorations are two centimetres thick Deputy director of archaeology and site director R Sivanantham said they found the container a day ago, and when they continued to dig further they found another similar ring. He said only further digging would confirm if the structure was a part of a ring well, many of which have already been found in Keeladi for storing water or grains. Sources say it is inspiring to find out that those of a bygone era approached everything, including basic needs with creativity. The ring wells unearthed in Keeladi, have an interlocking system where sand cannot enter the wells, but air and water could percolate through them. It is believed that these structures helped the inhabitants of Keeladi to have more permanent dwellings and as they had water and did not have the need to migrate during droughts. They are not mere structures. They are pieces of art, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/terracotta-container-unearthed-in-keeladi/articleshow/84304736.cms||---

Speaking at the meeting, the collector said that there were no cases of Zika virus in the district. However, since Zika virus was found to be spread by the aedes aegypti mosquito, controlling the mosquito menace is important at this juncture.Public representatives of local bodies and officials of municipalities should check the spread of mosquitoes and drinking water should be adequately chlorinated. Steps should also be taken to prevent water stagnation which would aid the breeding of these mosquitoes on roadsides and buildings, he said.People should seek medical intervention if they experience symptoms like body pain, muscular pain, reddening of eyes, red patches on the body, headache, pain in the limbs or joints, the collector said.

Through this initiative called ‚Äò7 to 7‚Äô spanning 12 hours, the farmers successfully planted hundreds of paddy seeds covering 25 acres of small land holdings within a day‚Äôs time. ‚ÄúWe are trying to offer solutions to the problem of labour shortages and the non-availability of machines. We are working on getting the task done sooner, with efficiency and on time,‚Äù said Fr George Quadros, who led the project. This community farming initiative has been taken up without availing of the directorate of agriculture‚Äôs community farming scheme. The team intends to transplant about three lakh square metres in the village over a period of time, therefore covering a total of four lakh square metres of land this season. ‚ÄúWhen working manually, we had the entire family to help us, but it‚Äôs not often that we have enough hands to work in the fields. Using mechanisation is therefore an optimal solution,‚Äù said farmer John Rebello. Quadros had similarly led farmers in the village to plant an area of 56,000sqm in a day last year. ‚ÄúWe wanted to challenge ourselves to transplant large tracts of land through mechanisation and wanted to set an example of the immense possibilities of using technology. We planned it properly and the farmers kept the seeds ready for transplantation. Fallow lands in Goa can be converted with ease if services are available, people come together and efficiently manage the task,‚Äù he said. Mechanisation is also going to be used for the harvesting of the paddy crop, said Jose Santan Rodrigues, head of the Curtorim farmers‚Äô union. In the rabi season, the farmers intend to use drones to sprinkle weedicide on the land to control the weeds and even fertilisers. In case of pest control problems, the pest control agents will also be sprinkled on the rabi crops using the drones. ‚ÄúIn case of locust attacks or even fungus due to climate change, a farmer need not use a handpump to save his crops. The drone can cover one acre of land in 10 minutes, especially in vast tracts of fields. Whatever the issue is, it can be solved speedily,‚Äù Quadros said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/curtorim-community-farmers-transplant-25-acres-in-just-1-day/articleshow/84304974.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Delhi||Rape case: Delhi court refuses to grant bail to naval officer for ‚Äòshallow conduct‚Äô||NEW DELHI: Citing ‚Äúshallow conduct‚Äù of a naval officer due to his alleged efforts to mislead the court with false facts, a Delhi court has refused to grant him protection from arrest in a sexual assault case against him. The court dismissed his anticipatory bail plea, considering that the alleged influence of his rank may bar a fair and proper investigation. Additional sessions judge Anil Antil noted that during the proceedings, on query by the court, the accused had ‚Äúsurprisingly‚Äù submitted that he has already deleted the records in the form of chats/text messages/ mails/Facebook chats between the parties and there was nothing substantive pertaining to the case in his possession as of now. ‚ÄúThe act of the applicant (naval officer) further reflects his intention to cover up his wrongs by erasing the relevant electronic record/data, which would have otherwise given the true picture of the case crime,‚Äù the court said. The police alleged that the officials at the naval guest house were not cooperating in the probe and working under the accused‚Äôs influence. The court noted that the officer‚Äôs statement that the woman was obsessed with him and was trying to extort money was ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù and contrary to the factual matrix of the case revealed so far. The judge further noted that the accused was at higher ranks in the Naval Academy and most of the evidence pertained to their visits/stay at the naval guest house where the offence was alleged to have been committed. ‚ÄúThus, in the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case, in the light of nature of accusation, severity of the offence and observing the conduct, and also influence of his rank in creating bars in the fair and proper investigation of the matter, I am not inclined to grant pre-arrest protection to the accused,‚Äù the court said. According to the FIR, in the second week of December 2019, the accused allegedly took the woman to a naval guest house in the capital, offered her a drink laced with sedatives and then raped her. Police had submitted that the accused had allegedly taken objectionable photographs of the complainant and threatened to circulate them on social media and to her family members. The counsel for the accused had moved the court seeking pre-arrest protection on the grounds that the case was allegedly ‚Äúfalse‚Äù, ‚Äúfrivolous‚Äù and registered against him in connivance of the local police at the behest of the complainant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rape-case-no-bail-for-naval-officer-for-shallow-conduct/articleshow/84304844.cms||Usha Das

Long queues of vehicles, fuming passengers and hassled traffic police personnel could be seen as farmers‚Äô union members joined the protest staged by temporary employees seeking regularisation. President, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Punjab, Rajinder Benipal said temporary employees of some departments and teachers staged a protest near Sirhind Canal on Saturday and they (farmers unions) supported them. ‚ÄúDemands of teachers should have been agreed to long ago by the government as they provide education to children. We supported them the way they supported us,‚Äù said BKU Punjab president. Police had to divert traffic at Samrala Chowk to service lanes near Dhandari Kalan, Sahnewal, Doraha and Khanna. This led to traffic snarls along the main highway from Ludhiana to Khanna, especially on one side. Vehicles, including buses, were hedged on the wrong side of the road at several places near Dhandari, Sahnewal, Doraha and Khanna. Even though part of the road did not have much traffic, police still diverted vehicles, especially those headed towards Khanna, to the service lane. In Khanna, traffic moved at snail‚Äôs pace. The confusion and heat led to frazzled nerves among commuters. ‚ÄúIt normally takes around an hour to reach Khanna from Samrala Chowk but today, because of traffic issues, it took me more than double the time to cover the same distance. It was a bad experience exacerbated by the hot weather. Vehicles consumed more fuel as the air conditioner had to be kept on in slow traffic,‚Äù said Surjeet Singh, a commuter. Traffic police personnel also said they faced problems managing traffic. ‚ÄúAs Thekedar mazdoors (contractual workers) staged a protest near Sirhind of Fatehgarh Sahib from 10am to 4pm, traffic in Khanna was slowed down. Our men faced problems managing traffic as it was quite hot,‚Äù said city traffic in-charge Khanna, inspector Jagjiwan Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/chaos-on-ldh-delhi-highway-as-protesters-hold-up-traffic/articleshow/84301264.cms||---

The step has been taken in view of increased crowding at resorts in rural areas. Superintendent of police, Pune (rural), Abhinav Deshmukh said that there is a new trend to conduct marriages in resorts located in isolated areas so that more people can be invited. ‚ÄúWe have received complaints in the last few days. To control the activity, we will conduct a special drive across our limit,‚Äù he said. There are over 500 such resorts across Maval, Mulshi, Khed, Bhor and Velhe tehsils. As per state government directives, 50 guests are allowed to attend a marriage in a closed hall, while 100 people can attend if the ceremony is held in an open space. ‚ÄúWe have told all officers in-charge of police stations to hold meetings with owners to apprise them of the guidelines and action that can be taken against them,‚Äù Deshmukh stated. According to sources, resorts charge between Rs 50,000 to Rs 2 lakh for a wedding. The rates vary as per the locality. Meanwhile, the owners of resorts claimed that their venues are ‚ÄòCovid-compliant‚Äô. ‚ÄúOften, the bride or groom agree to follow the restrictions, but they invite more guests. In such cases, we are unable to do anything. People also need to adhere to the norms strictly,‚Äù said Sandesh Jadhav, owner of a resort in Maval tehsil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/resort-owners-flouting-norms-to-face-the-music/articleshow/84304841.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP, ally claim win on 648 out of 825 block pramukh seats||LUCKNOW: After sweeping the Zila Panchayat chairman elections, the BJP continued with its electoral juggernaut in the Block Pramukh polls as well on Saturday. While the state election commission did not demarcate the winners on the basis of their political affiliations, the BJP and its ally Apna Dal (S) claimed to have won 648 out of 825 block chairperson seats. The development potentially armed the saffron party and its ally to claim their political presence in the rural swathes ahead of the high stake UP assembly elections due next year. According to reports, the BJP-supported candidates contested on 735 seats, while 14 seats were given to its ally Apna Dal (S). The party also gave an unannounced support to 76 candidates while agreeing not to field its officially supported candidates against them. As results trickled in, BJP and its ally AD (S)-supported candidates were poised to win 648 seats. The Samajwadi Party-backed candidates, according to reports, won in over 70 seats, while Congress-supported candidates managed a win on just two seats. The independents won on around 95 seats. The BJP put out details of its electoral victory late Saturday evening, claiming that the saffron party and its ally Apna Dal together won the maximum of 136 out of 173 blocks in Awadh region comprising 13 districts including Lucknow and Ayodhya. The BJP made a clean sweep in 12 districts -- Ghaziabad, Lucknow, Varanasi, Badaun, Shahjahanpur, Agra, Shravasti, GB Nagar, Pilibhit, Kannauj, Banda and Mahoba. The NDA partners, the BJP claimed, won 116 block chairman seats in Gorakhpur region -- the political backyard of CM Yogi Adityanath -- which comprises 147 blocks spread across over 10 districts. The allies also won 112 out of 129 block chairman seats in Braj region which comprises 12 districts including Mathura. So was the case with Kashi region, comprising 12 districts including Varanasi, the parliamentary seat of PM Narendra Modi. Here, the BJP and Apna Dal (S)-supported candidates won 109 out of 157 block chairman seats. The NDA also claimed to perform well in the west UP region comprising 14 districts, many of which were marked by farmers' protest. Here the party claimed that its backed candidates won 85 out of 109 block chairman seats. In the Kanpur region -- comprising 14 districts -- the NDA claimed to have won 90 out of 110 block chairman seats. On Friday, as many as 349 candidates were elected unopposed after 187 of them took back their nominations. Polling for the remaining 476 seats were conducted on Saturday. The BJP had on Friday claimed that 334 of its supported candidates won unopposed. The rural bodies‚Äô elections had stoked a political contest after the BJP formally announced its candidates for Zila Panchayat as well as for the block-level elections. As a matter of fact, the elections for ZP chairman and block chairman remained restricted between the BJP and the SP even as BSP chief Mayawati walked out of the high-pitched poll battle citing irregularities and rigging. The Congress, too, largely remained out of the contest with the party not making any concerted efforts in supporting candidates and ensuring their win.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-ally-claim-win-on-648-out-of-825-block-pramukh-seats/articleshow/84306754.cms||Pankaj Shah

The plan, which had been kept open for scrutiny for 60 days, has been finalised and is now available at the NGPDA office and at the offices of the Arpora-Nagoa panchayat and the Parra panchayat. The notification of the Arpora-Nagoa-Parra ODP- 2030 is the culmination of a two-year-long exercise that began with the adoption of the land use map and register for the Arpora-Nagoa-Parra planning area. After the NGPDA adopted the land use map and register in December 2018, it moved to draft the ODP- 2030 last July. ‚ÄúThe ODP- 2030 of the Arpora-Nagoa-Parra planning area was submitted to the government on July 6 for approval that was granted on July 7.

The draft ODP was placed before the town and country planning (TCP) board on July 29 last year and had received provisional approval. The state government also approved the draft ODP-2030 for Arpora-Nagoa-Parra and had given people 60 days to voice their objections and suggestions. ‚ÄúAfter inspecting the sites and hearing the objections received, the committee constituted by the NGPDA considered the same and submitted its report to the authority, and after taking necessary decisions, unanimously approved the ODP-2030,‚Äù said Pandita.

---||Mumbai||Maha contingent hailed by Hitler & given a medal during Olympics||Dhyan Chand, the hockey legend who had reportedly played without shoes during the second half of India‚Äôs historic final against Germany at the 1936 Berlin Olympics wasn‚Äôt the only barefooted athlete to bring home a gold medal that year. An army of pheta-sporting Maharashtrian and Gujarati men, who had marched behind the British-flag-carrying official Indian Olympic contingent with a curious saffron flag bearing symbols like the tricolour, an upward arrow and a star, returned from the Games with two special gold medals, one of which is known locally as the ‚ÄòHitler Medal‚Äô. By balancing themselves atop a malkhamb pole, squatting for rounds of kho-kho, chanting ‚Äòhu tu tu‚Äô in kabaddi and contorting into yoga asanas, 24 sportsmen from Amravati‚Äôs Hanuman Vyayam Prasarak Mandal, set up in 1914, won an Olympic medal with the Nazi symbol of an eagle clutching a swastika. It was their prize for standing second in ‚Äúphysical culture display‚Äù at the World Pedagogic Congress, where nations showcased their indigenous sports. How desi team got ‚ÄòVande Mataram‚Äô played at a Berlin Olympic banquetAmong the Mumbaikars in the Indian contingent that ended up winning a medal at the first-of-its-kind International Sports Pedagogic Congress during the Berlin Olympics in 1936 were Vile Parle‚Äôs Nagindas Mehta and Premji Rajoda, G G Rajderkar, S V Kher and a strapping, 21-year-old sports teacher from Parel named Dattaram Lad aka ‚ÄòLad Master‚Äô. The idea of the first-of-its-kind congress, where various nations showcased their indigenous sports, was born from a friendship between Amravati‚Äôs Hanuman Vyayam Prasarak Mandal stalwart L J Kokardekar, who had been studying in Berlin in the 1930s, and Carl Diem, chief organiser of the 1936 Olympic Games, said mandal director Suresh Deshpande. In a letter to Kokardekar, S D Sondhi, secretary of the fledgling Indian Olympic Association, wrote: ‚ÄúI am taking steps to send your gymnasts‚Äô names (sic) for the Sports Pedagogic Congress where only, according to Diem, your gymnasts can give displays.‚Äù This largely crowdfunded trip to Berlin saw the athletes sailing in an Italian ship called 'Kamteverde' to Venice, bonding with Chinese sportsmen and taking a train to Germany. According to a TOI article, the opening ceremony of the Games saw the earthy team singing Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs ‚ÄòEkla Chalo Re‚Äô. A barley-based health drink called Biomalt was favoured by Austria, which stood first in physical culture display, while ‚Äúcurry, meats including mutton, veal, lamb and fowl but no beef, pork or beef suet‚Äù formed the special dietary requests of India‚Äôs contingents that year, as per a sports portal. When photos of the desi flexers led by Yavatmal physician Dr S K Kane dotted German newspapers the day after their demonstrations, an intrigued Adolf Hitler invited the pehelwans for an interaction, recalls Kane‚Äôs 89-year-old son Padmakar. The Nazi leader had presented his father with a special medal, a certificate with his signature and a question that Kane would repeat on cue for the rest of his life. ‚ÄúDoes your team represent the average Indian?‚Äù Hitler had apparently asked Kane, referring to the brigade whose spines had been proclaimed by an official as ‚Äúthe most perfect‚Äù after examination. When every participating nation‚Äôs national anthem was played during an event in Berlin, the official Indian team stood up for the British national anthem ‚ÄòGod save the queen‚Äô but the desi army didn‚Äôt, says Kane‚Äôs son Padmakar. ‚ÄúMy father was a nationalist by temperament. He told his team to remain seated through it,‚Äù recalls Padmakar, adding that when a German minister probed them, the musclemen said that they considered ‚ÄòVande Mataram‚Äô to be their national anthem. ‚ÄúThe minister asked them for a recording. That‚Äôs how ‚ÄòVande Mataram‚Äô came to be played at the official banquet,‚Äù says Padmakar, adding that his father had come in contact with Bengal‚Äôs Yugantar, a secret revolutionary party that had started under the guise of a fitness club, while studying medicine in Bengal. HVPM‚Äôs website makes no secret of the mandal‚Äôs own nationalism-doused mythology. Founded by the Vaidya brothers, Anant and Ambadas, who wanted to link physical education with the Independence movement, the mandal boasted many freedom fighters, including Shivaram Raj-guru who studied here in 1926-27. Mahatma Gandhi and Sub-has Chandra Bose visited the mandal twice. In fact, Dr S G Patwardhan, the mandal‚Äôs then president, ‚Äúcould not go to Berlin in 1936 as he was denied a passport for political reasons‚Äù, says Deshpande. Lad‚Äôs Pune-based grandson Somdutt said: ‚ÄúAfter marriage, he would often leave home at night saying he had some work. My grandmother found out he was a freedom fighter when Veer Savarkar visited him one day in the 1940s‚Ä¶ He was killed before Independence in January 1947.‚Äù His grandmother Snehlata, an archer and sports teacher, was severely scarred by the loss. ‚ÄúWhen my father, a black belt in judo, got an offer to train in Japan, she didn‚Äôt allow him to go,‚Äù says Somdutt. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt want to lose any more people.‚Äù Today, only time-worn pictures and stories remain of the contingent and the mandal has taken to calling the Olympic gold medal, which sits safe in its Amravati office, the ‚ÄòHitler medal‚Äô.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/how-desi-team-got-vande-mataram-played-at-a-berlin-olympic-banquet/articleshow/84306795.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

As per the communication issued by minister of state for home Satej Patil, all such offences registered prior to December 31, 2019, are to be placed before the committee for consideration. ‚ÄúAll the protests, agitations in the form of calling band, gherao, held for attracting state and the administration‚Äôs attention to the issues faced by the public, are booked for violating the preventive orders. On being charge-sheeted, the cases go on for years together due to which the state has been receiving requests for withdrawing of political as well as social agitation related cases‚Äù states the communication while citing the powers granted under section 321 of CrPC to be used for withdrawing of such cases. The communication is based on the cabinet decision taken in December 2020 to withdraw police cases filed over five years against people who participated various political and social agitations. For the commissionerate areas, a three-member committee will be headed commissioner of police comprising additional director prosecution and deputy commissioner of police (crime) and for the rural/district police areas. The district collector will the head committee comprising additional director prosecution and additional superintendent of police. These committees will review the cases before forwarding the proposal to the state home department for sanction. Additional director general of police (law and order) Rajender Singh said, ‚ÄúSerious offences like assaulting a public servant during agitation or rioting involving loss to life are not withdrawn.‚Äù In cases involving loss to public or private property where the damage is more than Rs 10 lakh, the amount is recovered from the agitators before a proposal to withdraw the case is put forth, said the officer. As per the decision taken by Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi, all political and social agitation-related offences registered between November 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019, will be withdrawn. It was the Devendra Fadnavis-led government in Maharashtra that had withdrawn cases against those who had engaged in similar protests from May 2005 to November 2014 ‚Äî the period during which the saffron party was in opposition. A cabinet sub-committee headed by the then state finance minister was formed to withdraw the cases. As per an estimate, there could be thousands of such offences registered during the period of five years in the state, including Maratha reservation and CAA NRC-related cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/state-orders-for-taking-steps-to-withdraw-political-social-offences/articleshow/84301332.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Though the Jaipur Met office had predicted the progress of monsoon towards eastern Rajasthan, widespread rainfall was elusive. In Jaipur, mild to moderate showers in scattered form was witnessed at Malviya Nagar, Jagatpura and Sanganer. ‚ÄúIt was expected that south west monsoon will enter at many districts in the eastern Rajasthan, however its progress seen on Saturday was not very good. Widespread activity actually kicks off the monsoon which was not seen,‚Äù said Radhey Shyam Sharma, Director Jaipur Met office. Mild to moderate showers were also been witnessed at Dausa, Bassi, Tunga, Kanota, Dudu and other areas yet widespread activity was not seen. ‚ÄúThis year there has been the longest monsoon break. Usually after the entry of monsoon it covers the entire state within seven days. However, this year so far the break has sustained for more than 19 days so far,‚Äù he added. In the absence of good rainfall activity, majority of the places witnessed higher humidity levels. ‚ÄúIn the coming days there is no forecast of heavy rainfall in Rajasthan,‚Äù said an officer with Jaipur Met office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/monsoon-yet-to-gather-steam-in-raj/articleshow/84304908.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Palamuru LI project public hearing on August 10||HYDERABAD: Continuing its fight against Rayalaseem lift irrigation scheme (RLIS) taken up by Andhra Pradesh, Telangana is gearing up for early completion of Palamuru-Rangareddy lift irrigation scheme (PRLIS) on the river Krishna. The Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) would conduct public hearing at Nagarkurnool, Narayanpet, Vikarabad, Mahbubnagar, Nalgonda and Rangareddy districts on August 10. Public hearing is mandatory for acquiring land and going ahead with the project. The project has been designed to utilize excess flood water of about 90 tmcft in about 60 days (1.5 tmcft a day) during the flood season from the foreshores of the Srisailam project, which would have five stages. The project cost has been pegged at about Rs 52,000 crore. The government has also secured permissions from various central government agencies. Irrigation department officials said one of the main purposes of this project was to provide drinking water to en route villages and industrial purposes. It would also irrigate over 12 lakh acres of farm land in five districts through a network of canals. ‚ÄúAll the five districts are drought-prone and face problems of high fluoride content in the groundwater. With the project, they have great benefit,‚Äù a superintending engineer of the irrigation department said. As the Telangana government has complained on RLIS, and Rajolibanda diversion scheme (RDS) aimed at drawing water from Srisailam project, the AP government also complained against PRLIS. Official sources said the CM directed the finance and irrigation officials to allocate sufficient funds for completion of the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/palamuru-li-project-public-hearing-on-august-10/articleshow/84307612.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Dehradun||Kanwar yatra can be much riskier than Kumbh: Experts||DEHRADUN: As Uttarakhand considers the possibility of allowing the annual kanwar yatra, experts have cautioned against it, expressing concerns that the fortnight-long pilgrimage could be ‚Äúfive times more likely to be a superspreader event‚Äù than the Kumbh festival that took place in Haridwar in April. According to experts, the risk of spread of Covid-19 infection is higher in kanwar yatra than it was at the Maha Kumbh mela as the number of devotees undertaking the yatra is likely to be significantly higher than those who attended Kumbh. The footfall for kanwar yatra in the previous years has ranged between 2 crore and 5 crore. Anoop Nautiyal, whose organisation Social Development for Communities Foundation has been closely tracking the Covid scenario in the state, said, ‚ÄúEven if standard operating procedures regarding Covid behaviour are put in place and the kanwar yatra allowed, the SOPs will be impossible to implement. We have seen that at the Kumbh and more recently when lockdown restrictions were eased and tourists flocked to hill stations.‚Äù Coronavirus: Live updatesNautiyal added, ‚ÄúKanwar yatra will be many times more dangerous than Kumbh. About 3 to 4 crore pilgrims will visit Haridwar in a fortnight compared with the 70 lakh that came during the 30-day Kumbh. The state will not be able to handle the infection spread post-kanwar yatra. A decision must be taken keeping in mind the third wave of Covid-19.‚Äù Dr NS Khatri, deputy medical superintendent and Covid care centre coordinator of the state‚Äôs largest Covid facility, Doon Medical College Hospital, said, ‚ÄúIn an ideal situation it (the kanwar yatra) should be avoided as Uttarakhand has already recorded its first Delta-plus case.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kanwar-yatra-can-be-much-riskier-than-kumbh-experts/articleshow/84308411.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Pune||Pune: Crimes against women, thefts, assaults up in eastern fringes||PUNE: Last week, a four-year-old girl was sexually assaulted by a man at Mantarwadi, in the Loni Kalbhor police limits. On Wednesday, a woman police sub-inspector registered a case with the Lonikand police, accusing a man of stalking and harassing her after she turned down his marriage proposal. These are not isolated cases, but indicators of a recent spurt in crimes against women. Further, ever since the Loni Kalbhor and Lonikand police stations were merged in the Pune police limits in March this year, unceasing body offences and vehicle thefts have been a constant source of worry for residents and law enforcement officers alike. So far this year, these two police stations have registered 27 cases of crime against women, 78 body offence cases and 74 cases of vehicle theft. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI that multiple factors were behind the spurt in such crimes in these areas. ‚ÄúOur efforts are entirely focused on detecting and preventing such crimes,‚Äù Gupta said, adding, ‚ÄúWe have increased manpower at each of the two police stations by 100 apiece, from the earlier 35-40 personnel, which was inadequate for the vast jurisdiction the police stations cover.‚Äù The Loni Kalbhor police station is spread over 242sqkm, while Lonikand police station covers 347sqkm area. Collectively, this is almost on par with the entire jurisdiction of the Pune police commissionerate before the merger. Serious crimes aside, a new set of problems is plaguing housing societies in the fringe areas. Nitin Kumar Jain, director of Wagholi Housing Society Association, said, ‚ÄúThere are complaints relating to ‚Äòtanker mafia‚Äô threatening and extorting societies to supply water. Housekeeping vendors too are resorting to similar tactics to offer their services.‚Äù Rapid urbanisation, inadequate CCTV surveillance of residential and commercial areas, large-scale migration within and from outside Maharashtra have contributed to the overall situation. Dilip Walhekar, another businessman, said, burglaries were a major problem. ‚ÄúMany housing societies have not appointed armed security guards and have not installed CCTV cameras for better surveillance. Burglars find it easier to target locked flats in these areas as there is little to no police presence on the streets,‚Äù he said. Wagholi‚Äôs Nitin Kumar Jain said the issue of CCTV surveillance was slowly being solved, with many societies and shops installing cameras. ‚ÄúWe have requested the police to reactivate the Gram Suraksha Dal ‚Äî a citizens group ‚Äî to help in in night patrolling,‚Äù he said. Activist Vikram Shewale felt unemployment and a lack of jobs were at the root of some of the problems. ‚ÄúSchool or college drop-outs in the 18-22 years age group are often seen loitering at junctions or roadsides, many of them harassing, staring at, misbehaving with, and passing lewd comments at women,‚Äù Shewale said. He said women were afraid of approaching the police, as they live in the same neighbourhood as these youths. ‚ÄúThe fear of social stigma also prevents them from approaching the police. The problem has only become more acute during the Covid-19 lockdowns. We have time and again appealed to police to intensify patrols between 5pm and 8pm, and counsel youths. Police tend to shoo the youngsters away and warn them against loitering, but these measures are hardly a deterrence,‚Äù Shewale said. Law academic Jyoti Dharm believed increasing the presence of women police personnel on the streets could have a deterrent effect. ‚ÄúLegal camps should be conducted to educate men and women of their rights,‚Äù she said. Businessman Nandu Kalbhor said socio-economic factors like recession, job loss, unemployment and salary cuts contributed to crimes like body offences and vehicle thefts. He observed that petty fights have declined to some extent after the police turned up the heat against those involved in body offence cases. ‚ÄúPatrols have intensified in fringe villages and distress calls to police control room are getting a quick response,‚Äù he observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crimes-against-women-thefts-assaults-up-in-eastern-fringes/articleshow/84304944.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Activists fume as bldrs named in trust land fraud duck action||Navi Mumbai: In 2011, the state government formed a three-member inquiry committee to investigate the fraudulent conversion of lands owned by the Sir Mohammed Yusuf Trust, Mumbai (645 acres), the Khan Bahadur Hormasji Maneckji Bhiwandiwala (KBHMB) Trust, Mumbai (2,000 acres in 18 villages), and the Sri Swami Hatiramji Mutt Trust, Tirupati (82 acres). Some of Navi Mumbai‚Äôs top builders were named in a report submitted by the committee as it investigated the violations. Local activists say no action has been taken against the accused so far.The 12.5% which Cidco handed back to the purported owners were later taken over by builders, it was claimed. A public interest litigation came to be filed in the Bombay high court in 2011 and the issue was also raised in the upper house by certain MLCs, including Chandrakant Patil.The three-member committee comprised deputy collectors (land acquisitions) Sameer Kurtkoti, Makrand Deshmukh and Revati Gaikar. The committee submitted a 20-page report to the Raigad collector on December 27, 2013, and called for a police investigation, among other recommendations.Then Raigad collector on January 10, 2014 had recommended to the Konkan Divisional Commissioner an investigation and filing of criminal offences against builder Urmesh Udani, talathi Sanjay Sonawane, security guard Shri Bhagat of Metro Centre 1. Sonawane and Bhagat took voluntary retirement before any investigation and action for their alleged involvement in the irregularities could be taken. The two were unavailable for comment on the matter.‚ÄúThe report mentions lands of Sir Mohammed Yusuf trust-Mumbai and Khan Bahadur Hormasji Maneckji Bhiwandiwala trust-Mumbai were purchased by builder Urmesh Udani, who later claimed 12.5% developed land benefits. Several other builders and politicians colluded with Cidco officials to grab land. But the government never acted against the culprits,‚Äù alleged Rajeev Mishra, a right to information (RTI) activist, who obtained the documents.‚ÄúThe Raigad collector had recommended to the Konkan Divisional Commissioner to lodge a first information report. Instead of lodging the FIRs, authorities mixed up the issue with eight other police FIRs lodged for separate offences and an economic offences wing investigation. This was a deliberate attempt to divert the attention of the public from the core issue. Last month, I demanded a police investigation but my complaint is still pending,‚Äù added Mishra.‚ÄúThere are various investigations going on by the police,‚Äù said Shashikant Mahavarkar, chief vigilance officer, Cidco. Efforts to contact the Sri Swami Hathiramji Mutt trust were unsuccessful. Narendra Jhaveri of Khan Bahadur Hormasji Maneckji Bhiwandiwala trust-Mumbai declined to comment on the issue. A Sir Mohammed Yusuf trust-Mumbai official, Harshada Bhande, said, ‚ÄúDue to Covid no one is available right now.‚ÄùA power of attorney holder for some of trustees of the Khan Bahadur Hormasji Maneckji Bhiwandiwala trust, also said, ‚ÄúTrust land dispute cases are pending in Bombay High Court and Charity Commissioner for disposal. These are unnecessarily delayed.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-activists-fume-as-bldrs-named-in-trust-land-fraud-duck-action/articleshow/84306894.cms||Umesh K Parida

They said the images of a conch, chakram, umbrella, stick, water jug, sun, moon, parsu and plough were carved on the rocks. The team comprising S Arulanadam Krishnakumar, S Kumaran and T Siva Raj had subsequently approached Trichy-based archaeo-symbolist T L Subash Chandira Bose to study the rock carvings.Bose says, ‚ÄúIt is a very rare and interesting finding of symbolic representation of Lord Vishnu and his three incarnations. Lord Vishnu, who is known as ‚ÄúSangu Chakra Dhaari‚Äù, is symbolically depicted as ‚Äúsangu‚Äù (conch) and ‚Äúchakram‚Äù. Umbrella, stick with a rope and water jug denote Lord Vamanar, while parasu denotes Lord Parasuraman and plough denotes Lord Balaraman.‚Äù In Srimad-Bhagavatam, he says, Vishnu‚Äôs fifth incarnation Vamana is mentioned as a brahmachari, wearing a loincloth (koupeena) and sacred thread, and holding an umbrella and a stick (dhanda) in one hand and a water jug (kamandala) in the other hand. ‚ÄúIn Vishnudharmottara Purana and Rupamandana, a man carrying an axe is described as Parasuraman, the sixth incarnation of Lord Vishnu. In Hindu mythology, Balaraman, the elder brother of Lord Krishna and considered the eighth incarnation of Lord Vishnu, carries a plough.‚ÄùThe petroglyphs, Bose says, may be referring to the land donated to the Maha Vishnu temple that existed around 16th century near Anumanthapuram in Dharmapuri district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/rock-art-on-lord-vishnus-three-avatars-found-in-dharmapuri/articleshow/84303007.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Footfall rises in OPDs after drop in Covid numbers||KOLKATA: With the number of Covid patients having dropped sharply, non-Covid patients have started swarming hospitals across the city. While OPD footfall has shot up by 80% to 85%, hospital bed occupancy at non-Covid wards has also gone up significantly. Hospitals have converted most Covid wards to non-Covid zones to accommodate general patients. ‚ÄúDuring pre-Covid times, we would have 700+ OPD patients on a daily average. During the Covid surge, the OPD had become deserted with patients taking to online consultations. Even two weeks ago, we would have just about 100 to 150 patients. Now, it has picked up and we are seeing 500-plus OPD registrations minus patients from Bangladesh. This is quite an encouraging number,‚Äù said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. From departments like medicine, cardiology, orthopaedic, urology and eyecare, a mixed bag of patients is now back to hospitals after months. Hospitals started seeing a dip in non-Covid patients from March-end and by May, apart from emergency cases, pati-ents had stopped visiting hospitals. ‚ÄúThe footfall in our OPD is now about 85% of pre-Covid days. The hospital bed occupancy currently is about 90% by non-Covid patients while Covid patients are occupying only about 10% beds,‚Äù said Medica Group chairperson Alok Roy. CMRI Hospital currently has 500-plus OPD patients against its usual footfall of 700-plus patients. Only 20 Covid patients are admitted against 289 non-Covid patients. Apart from those suffering from influenza, patients are also getting admitted for planned surgeries. ‚ÄúWe now get around 950 patients across our OPDs against our normal footfall of 1,200-plus. Also, due to the sharp fall in Covid patients (only 18 currently), we plan to reduce our Covid zone to only one area that can hold about 25 beds so that we can use non-Covid beds,‚Äù said Narayana Health zonal director (east) R Venkatesh. The number of Covid patients at three units of AMRI has slipped down to 26. The count of patients visiting hospitals to consult doctors physically is now about 60% of its normal footfall. ‚ÄúPatients are now more comfortable and confident in coming back to the hospital after the sharp drop in Covid cases. Our OPD chambers have seen an abrupt jump in footfall as patients are thronging various departments. Online consultations were just a stop-gap measure,‚Äù said Belle Vue CEO Pradip Tondon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/footfall-rises-in-opds-after-drop-in-covid-numbers/articleshow/84303009.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The pharmaceutical manufacturing unit is located on Chandpur Road.Officials then rushed to the site and found that it was a case of "gas leak".Further investigations led to findings of large scale irregularities. It also included illegal extraction of groundwater.A committee comprising representatives of Central Pollution Control Board and UP Pollution Control Board was formed for a "factual and action taken report". The panel found untreated effluent in storm drains. Besides, the unit was unable to control the emission of HCL vapour due to the non-operational condition of wet scrubber attached to the HCL tank and this is when the gas leak may have occurred, sources said.In addition, the unit did not get NOC from Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) for abstraction of ground water.Hearing on the complaint was conducted on July 6 and the five-member NGT bench led by justice Adarsh Kumar Goel passed the order.The amount has to be submitted to the Amroha district magistrate (DM) for the "restoration of the environment degraded by the company".When contacted, Anroha DM, BK Tripathi, said, "It came to my notice that the NGT has slapped a fine of Rs 10 crore on a pharma firm. But, we have yet to receive a written order."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/ngt-slaps-rs-10-cr-penalty-on-pharma-firm-for-gross-violation-of-environmental-norms/articleshow/84303008.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Kolkata||Hosp off-site vax camp rethink after shortage of vial supply||KOLKATA: With fresh supply of vaccines yet to arrive under the new online procurement system, private hospitals in Kolkata are planning to cut down on off-site camps in the city and districts. Two city hospitals have already exhausted their stocks and others are wary of running out of their fast-depleting reserves. Most say they would rather save some vaccines to keep their on-site drives running than diverting stocks to off-site camps. AMRI, which has about a week‚Äôs stock left, has decided not set up any new camps. It may soon start reducing the number of doses at their existing off-site centres, which include South City and Acropolis malls. ‚ÄúOther than the two malls, we have been administering 1,200-1,400 doses at off-site centres occasionally, which will now have to stop. The malls will continue, though, along with our three hospitals. But unless we receive a fresh supply within the next few days, we might have to reduce the number of recipients everywhere,‚Äù said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. AMRI has been running off-site camps at Burdwan and Hooghly. It has sought 1.5 lakh doses for its three centres. Fortis Hospital has been forced to discontinue off-site and on-site vaccinations since it ran out of stock last Wednesday. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) had planned around 10 off-site camps over the next two weeks, including at least two outside the city limits. But they may now have to be deferred. ‚ÄúWith the current stock, we may have to postpone most of them till the supply arrives for this month,‚Äù said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. RTIICS has requisitioned 35,000 doses for July. which is yet to arrive. Woodlands Hospital has opted for a dual procurement system that allows them to buy vaccines directly from manufacturers other than applying for doses on the Co-Win portal through the government channel. While it has enough stocks of Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik acquired from manufacturers, the hospital has received nothing from the government yet. ‚ÄúFortunately, we have a dual procurement system so we have stocks of all three vaccines and off-site camps are on for us. We are doing 2,000 doses a day with an equal share between off-site and on-site centres,‚Äù said Woodlands managing director Rupali Basu. She, however, added that it‚Äôs taking longer to organize off-site camps since permission norms have got elaborate. Belle Vue Clinic has two off-site camps running at Park Street and at La Martiniere School. The hospital has applied for 18,000 doses this week and will not add any more off-site camps, other than the ones that are running. ‚ÄúWe have camps lined up at Agarpara, Sodepur, Bhadrakali and Dum Dum this week and we still have enough stocks to cater to recipients there,‚Äù added said Belle Vue CEO P Tondon. According to a government official, fresh applications for off-site camps have dropped. ‚ÄúWe have received many more requests for camps in districts,‚Äù said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosp-off-site-vax-camp-rethink-after-shortage-of-vial-supply/articleshow/84303013.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Delhi||Delhi: 5,0000 illegal borewells sealed, 15,000 still there||NEW DELHI: The second wave of Covid-19 pandemic in Delhi has also impacted the drive to seal illegal borewells in the city.  According to the latest status report on the illegal borewell sealing exercise, more than 20,350 illegal borewells have been surveyed across Delhi so far out of which only 5,430 have been sealed. The report, prepared by Delhi Jal Board, states that fines have been imposed in all these 5,430 cases and sealing is pending in the rest of the cases. The maximum number of violators has been found in the North West district (9,067), followed by South West Delhi (6,644) and the West district (2,185). According to the status report, 44% violators were found in North West, 32.6% in South West, 10.7% in West, 3.7% in North and 3.3% in Central Delhi. Other districts reported an even smaller number of violations. The process of sealing rest of the approximate 15,000 borewells has been resumed and officials say fines going up to Rs 5 lakh have been imposed, depending on the groundwater table of the area and the amount of water that has already been extracted. A senior government official said that district administrations were busy in dealing with Covid and the drive was halted due to the second wave, which led to the delay in completing the sealing action. Officials said that in many cases, people were also found packaging and selling the extracted water. While Delhi has installed capacity of 935 MGD (million gallons per day) water supply, the estimated demand is more than 1,250 MGD. In various parts of the capital, illegal borewells are used to meet the 300 MGD demand-supply gap. A DJB official said that many people were using illegal borewells in several planned areas to avoid crossing the usage limit under the 20KLD scheme. A DJB report on identified illegal groundwater extraction points shows that around 87% of the surveyed violators are located in North West, South West and West districts. Situation in the South West district in which Dwarka and Najafgarh belts fall is particularly alarming as the average groundwater readings are around 19.2 metres below the ground. There is a very high concentration of borewells in these areas. Even according to a Central Ground Water Board report from 2019, South Delhi district was the worst affected with average reading levels around 34.2 metres below the ground. In North Delhi, water was found just 5.7 metres below the ground. A DJB official said that action was being taken as per orders of the National Green Tribunal and the drive to seal illegal borewells would continue in the coming months. The issue of fast depleting groundwater resources in Delhi has come to the spotlight because of additional burden on the subsurface aquifers in the water-stressed city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/5k-illegal-borewells-sealed-15k-still-there/articleshow/84305097.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation needs one lakh doses to tide over vaccine shortfall||KOLKATA: The KMC needs to administer 1 lakh doses within the next seven days to overcome the second dose backlog. The civic body hopes to get an adequate quantity of vaccines to ramp up the inoculation drive. To achieve the rather stiff target, the KMC health department has asked executive health officers and medical officers of KMC-run Covid vaccination clinics (CVC) to reserve at least 50% of the allocations for the second dose from Tuesday. ‚ÄúThis is an urgent measure to clear the second-dose backlog, which is growing by leaps and bounds as we are facing an acute shortage of vaccines for the past several days,‚Äù a KMC health department official said. The KMC brass had to suspend first dose vaccination on Friday and Saturday due to paucity of supply and utilize whatever supply was available from Swasthya Bhawan to inoculate second-dose recipients. ‚ÄúEven then we couldn‚Äôt clear 15% of the total backlog. We hope to get an augmented supply from next week and prioritize the second-dose vaccination,‚Äù the official said. The official said the target from Tuesday would be to administer 15,000-20,000 second doses at 195 civic vaccination centres each day. This apart, KMC has decided to administer the second dose from the mega vaccination clinics from next week. According to rules, these centres can only cater to priority groups or super spreaders, including hawkers, vegetable sellers, fish vendors, security guards, domestic helps, teachers, journalists and government officers. However, the civic bosses have decided to relax rules to administer second doses since vaccine allocation for mega centres is higher. ‚ÄúWe hope to expedite the second dose vaccination from the clinics and mega centres. If need be, we will relax rules to accommodate recipients of the second dose. If we can manage a sizeable portion of available vaccines from Swasthya Bhawan for our clinics, we will be able to reach closer to our target,‚Äù the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-needs-1-lakh-doses-to-tide-over-vaccine-shortfall/articleshow/84303024.cms||Saikat Ray

Now, several herds of swamp deer have been sighted and their numbers could be more, say forest department officials. According to forest officials, these swamp deer generally concentrate in Jhilmil region of Uttarakhand but move towards the UP wetlands during monsoon. The deer herds have been sighted in Bijnor‚Äôs Balawali region, a corridor between Rajaji National Park and Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary. Some have also been spotted at Haiderpur Wetland located on the Ganga barrage in Bijnor. The 30-km stretch between Ganga Barrage and Balawali, known as Khadar region, is a marshy land suitable for the swamp deer with plentiful grass and natural protection for this animal listed as ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (ICUN) Red list. With increased sightings, the forest department has set up a temporary picket close to Ravali in the Khadar region and forest guards have been deployed in the region to keep poachers at bay. Residents of villages along the banks of the Ganga have been roped in to keep track of the herds and inform the department about illegal farmers and poachers. M Semmaran, Bijnor forest divisional officer, explained, ‚ÄúThe swamp deer come here in monsoon and stay on till the end of February. The move towards the Khadar area of UP's Hastinapur sanctuary is because of floods in Jhilmil. Irrigation department maintains water here till January and February.

---||Delhi||Be alert, but don‚Äôt panic if platelets low after Covid||NEW DELHI: Low platelet count is one of the common features of viral infections. But, in most cases, the platelets reach normal levels as soon as the infection subsides. However, in the case of Covid-19, doctors have come across patients who continue to exhibit low platelet counts for weeks after recovery. In most cases, the doctors pointed out, the deficit in platelets was marginal and didn‚Äôt require medical intervention. But there have been rare cases of patients coming with extremely low platelet counts necessitating medical management. ‚ÄúWe saw three recovered patients recently with very low 10,000-20,000 platelets per microlitre of blood. One 85-year-old man had a count of 2,000 with extensive bleeding below the skin. All of them required medical management, including administration of steroids,‚Äù said Dr Atul Gogia, senior consultant, internal medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine, Max Hospital, Saket, explained, ‚ÄúNormal platelet counts range from 1,50,000 to 4,00,000 per microlitre of blood. Of the recovered Covid patients, nearly 20% have platelet counts in the range of 1,00,000 to 1,50,000, which is low but this doesn‚Äôt necessitate any intervention. We should worry only if the platelet count reduces to 50,000 or less or if there is bleeding from the gums or the nose.‚Äù Dr Naveen Dang, consultant microbiologist and founder of Dr Dang‚Äôs Lab, said he had also seen many patients who continued to have platelets in the range of 1-1.5 lakh per microlitre of blood for weeks after recovering from the coronavirus infection. ‚ÄúIt is not something to be scared of,‚Äù he assured. Platelets are one of the cellular components of the blood along with white and red blood cells. They play an important role in clotting and bleeding. According to Dr Neeraj Nischal, an assistant professor in the medicine department of AIIMS, reduced platelet count after Covid could be caused by multiple factors, for example the administration of blood thinner drugs to treat the infection. ‚ÄúIt could also be an incidental finding and may suggest some underlying illness. The role of the novel coronavirus in disrupting the immune system to induce thrombocytopenia cannot be ruled out either, but this requires further investigation,‚Äù Nischal said. Last year, scientists from China reported a case in which a 49-year-old woman showed a very low platelet count for nearly four months after recovering from non-severe Covid. They attributed it to the damage suffered by the immune system during the corona infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/be-alert-but-dont-panic-if-platelets-low-after-covid/articleshow/84303078.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

But their lives took a sharp turn in January this year, after the Covid vaccination was rolled out. Since January 16, vaccinators and the support staff at KMC clinics have been working overtime to inoculate the population. And, in the process, many were also infected by the virus. Deboprasad Chatterjee, who is involved with the vaccination centre at Sulekha, was infected with Covid-19 and had to be put on a ventilator for days. With the help of doctors, he managed to skirt death and, within a month, was back at the centre helping people with registration on Co-Win and getting the jab. He even lost his sister to the virus, but the loss made him more determined to step up the fight against the virus. ‚ÄúGetting vaccinated is the only way to eradicate the disease. We will do everything in our capacity to contribute to this fight,‚Äù said Chatterjee. He has seen many of his colleagues, like Alok Rudra and Manas Barua, getting infected while on the job, but the disease could not deter them from continuing with the mission either. For some, like a vaccinator at Atabagan, the restrictions have only posed another challenge. ‚ÄúEveryday, I have to spend Rs 300 just on rickshaw fare to reach the vaccination centre. Still, I have managed to attend office every single day. I had to since a lot of lives are at stake and vaccination is the only solution,‚Äù she told TOI. According to a joint director of a vaccination centre, the response of the vaccinators and the support staff to the current situation has been inspiring. ‚ÄúFrom embracing new technology to working days on end without leave and overcoming personal grief at the shortest possible time, they have done it all. Their commitment has helped us in vaccinating so many people so far,‚Äù she said. Another centre head, however, sounded a word of caution. ‚ÄúThe workload is so heavy that they are drained, both emotionally and physically. I urge all recipients to be more patient while coming to take the jab,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/call-of-duty-after-winning-fight-against-covid-19-vaccinators-get-back-to-work/articleshow/84303065.cms||Debobrata Shome
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Infection rate down in Delhi from 36% in April to 0.1% now||NEW DELHI: The national capital recorded 76 fresh Covid cases and one death on Saturday, while the positivity rate slipped to 0.09%. Before this, Delhi had recorded a daily fatality count of one over three months ago on March 21. Saturday‚Äôs fatality pushed the death toll in the city to 25,012. On Tuesday, Delhi had reported 79 Covid cases and four fatalities. A day later, 93 cases and four deaths were recorded, according to official figures. On Friday, the daily infection tally was 81 and three deaths were recorded. The city‚Äôs infection rate, which had reached 36% in the last week of April, has fallen below 0.1% now. The occupancy of Covid beds has also reduced sharply over the last one months. Delhi has a total of 13,931 Covid beds of which, data shows, only about 451 are occupied currently. However, in view of a potential third wave, the government has decided to keep the beds reserved for Covid management. On Friday, DDMA passed a colour-coded response action plan under which curbs will be implemented in accordance with the severity of the Covid-19 situation to deal with a possible third wave. The state government has also started two genome-sequencing laboratories at LNJP and ILBS to detect newer variants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/infection-rate-down-in-capital-from-36-in-april-to-0-1-now/articleshow/84303059.cms||---
---||Delhi||Rs 51.7 crore: Covid fine Delhi paid in 2 months||NEW DELHI: If you had to put a figure to crass indiscipline, it would be 51.7 crore. That is the amount in rupees collected from careless Delhiites between April 23 and July 7 for disregarding Covid-appropriate behaviour. On April 20, Delhi reported over 28,000 single-day Covid cases and for many days patients were unable to find beds in hospitals or gasped for breath as oxygen supplies ran short, while the cremation grounds staggered with too many bodies to handle. But that apocalyptic ambience seems to have been quickly forgotten. After April 23, 2.7 lakh citizens have been penalised for disregarding the necessity to wear a mask. Over 27,000 people have been fined for not maintaining the required physical distancing in public, over 11,000 for spitting in the open, and over 3,000 for chewing gutka and tobacco or imbibing liquor in public spaces. An enforcement official said that most of the bookings took place in slightly over a month beginning with June when the government started lifting the lockdown restrictions in a phased manner and the number of people in public places started increasing. The lockdown relaxation began on May 31 with the government permitting manufacturing units in industrial areas and construction activities to restart. In phases after that, other commerce such as markets, malls, restaurants, gyms and yoga institutes were allowed to resume. Since the violations are dispersed across the city, the scale of violations has not been revealed, though the enforcement data indicates wide-spread, large-scale infractions. The volume of violations is alarming and shows that people do not bother about following the Covid guidelines despite the threat of a renewed surge. Since reopening, many crowded markets have seen blatant violations of the regulations about masks and social distancing, leading to a number of markets being closed by the district authorities. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has regularly appealed to Delhiites not to consider the Covid pandemic to be over, but to take care that the infection is checked by wearing masks and following social distancing norms. Delhi government has deployed 156 monitoring teams and around 130 vehicles to ensure strict enforcement of Covid norms across the city. At a Delhi Disaster Management Authority meeting on Friday, the 11 districts were asked to focus on enforcing the Covid regulations in public. Crowd-sensitive areas like markets, mandis, bus terminals, railway stations, restaurants are in the focus of the enforcement teams. The district authorities are also creating awareness among people by roping in market associations, residents welfare associations and other agencies. Dr Arun Gupta, president of Delhi Medical Council, said that similar irresponsible behaviour of the people was to a large extent responsible for the second Covid wave and continuing behaviour of this sort would usher in another spike in infections. ‚ÄúPeople must understand that the government alone cannot prevent Covid. It requires a collective effort and the citizens should adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour and also encourage others to do so,‚Äù said Gupta, who is also a member of Delhi government expert committee on the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-51-7cr-covid-fine-delhi-paid-in-2-mths/articleshow/84303043.cms||AlokKNMishra

An inquiry committee set up by the lieutenant governor earlier dismissed allegations of any scam in the process.‚ÄúThe inquiry committee has asked for cancellation of existing tender and issuing of a fresh one. This makes it clear that the committee found irregularities in the tender,‚Äù claimed Adesh Gupta. ‚ÄúBJP has been objecting more against the tender on maintenance of vehicles rather than the tender on bus purchases.‚ÄùBidhuri wondered why, when DTC had its own depots, workshops and employees, Delhi government was thinking of hiring an external agency for maintaining the new buses. ‚ÄúThe LG should immediately order an ACB probe into the matter,‚Äù he insisted.Vijender Gupta said that the three-member committee constituted by the LG mentioned in its report that it examined the material on record and observed that the allegations essentially pertained to the maintenance contract but had actually focused its attention only on the process of procuring new buses for DTC. He charged AAP with misguiding people by saying that the committee had probed the procurement process of DTC buses and had given the state government a clean chit.Gupta claimed that after finding the AMC process and contract faulty, the committee had suggested scrapping the deal entirely. He wryly observed that the transport secretary, who is not only a member of the probe committee but also directly reports to the transport minister, was asking for the tender be scrapped.The leader of the Opposition also said that the committee‚Äôs report had noted violations of General Financial Rules 2017 in the maintenance contract of the buses and no benchmark price in the Request for Proposal (RFP). There is no record of any internal cost assessment for benchmark bids against an estimation, he said.Vijender Gupta added that the inquiry committee‚Äôs report says that the RFP for AMC did not mention any method of evaluation for arriving at the lowest bid value and that the evaluation criteria adopted by DTC was flawed and not in consonance with the provision of relevant guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-bjp-to-press-for-acb-probe/articleshow/84303129.cms||---
---||Delhi||Sisodia: LG panel on buses called allegations baseless||New Delhi: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Saturday that a three-member committee constituted in June by Delhi‚Äôs lieutenant governor Anil Baijal has said in its report that the allegations of scam against the state government in the purchase of buses for the Delhi Transport Corporation were ‚Äúabsolutely baseless‚Äù.The committee, comprising O P Aggarwal, retired IAS officer and former head of Indian government‚Äôs urban transport division, the principal secretary (vigilance) and principal secretary-cum-commissioner (transport) of the Delhi government, was constituted last month by the LG. BJP leader and Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta had alleged irregularities in the procurement process of 1,000 low-floor buses.In a press conference on Saturday, Sisodia said in the presence of transport minister Kailash Gahlot that the senior leaders of BJP were continuously accusing Delhi government for three months now of being involved in a scam in the purchase of DTC buses. He said that after examining 3,000 documents, the high-level inquiry committee concluded that the allegations of misdoing by Delhi government were absolutely baseless.‚ÄúThe investigation committee of the BJP-led Central government has not been able to find any flaws or irregularities in the purchase of buses. The report of the inquiry committee has made it clear that the government led by Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi is honest and the Delhi BJP leaders in opposition are trying to malign the image of the government,‚Äù the deputy CM said.Sisodia added, ‚ÄúChief minister Kejriwal‚Äôs model of politics of good governance, honesty and work are being discussed all over the country. Delhi government is working day and night for the people of Delhi but instead of learning from it, BJP leaders are spreading hatred and lies. They are stopping the good work being done in public interest. BJP leaders should be ashamed and they should come in public to apologise.‚ÄùMinister Gahlot tweeted, ‚ÄúTruth prevails, conspiracies derail. I had always maintained that let BJP get any of our decisions probed from anywhere. Reality is that BJP‚Äôs real motive was to defame @ArvindKejriwal ji and derail the process of getting buses for Delhiites. I am happy that Delhi will get 1,000 buses.‚ÄùSisodia said that between 2008 and 2015, no buses were purchased in Delhi and after coming to power in 2015, whenever Kejriwal has taken out a tender for the purchase of buses to improve public transport, BJP leaders have tried to create hurdles. Sisodia expressed happiness that now the buses would arrive in Delhi and public transport service would be boosted.He also said that BJP had similarly made false allegations against Delhi government earlier, and the inquiry committee had summoned 400 files from the state government, but the panel had not found any error in the entire process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-lg-panel-on-buses-called-allegations-baseless/articleshow/84303109.cms||---

I initially tried at random, then based on the hospitals‚Äô recommendation, logged in from 5.55pm, only to get rejected,‚Äù she told TOI.Vaishnavi Lekha, who tried to get her husband a slot, also faced the same issue. ‚ÄúWe have been trying to get a slot for the past one week. Whenever we logged in, it said no slots were available. We then tried to contact the hospital directly.‚ÄùHospitals, however, said getting a slot on CoWIN is compulsory. ‚ÄúIt is the state government‚Äôs rule that Sputnik must be administered only based on slots on the website. While we agree that slots get over in minutes, we get 70-80 people a day who booked an appointment on the portal,‚Äù said a GKNM Hospital spokesperson. Rasi Hospital at R S Puram offers to assist people who have a pre-registration on the CoWIN portal for the vaccine. ‚ÄúIf people have a pre-registration and come in a group, we can help them get the slot, the jab and certificate,‚Äù said Jayaram from the hospital. ‚ÄúMany people prefer Sputnik because of reports of high efficiency and completion of both doses within a short period. They say Sputnik is the most effective among all vaccines.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/people-struggle-to-get-sputnik-jab-as-cowin-plays-spoilsport/articleshow/84303156.cms||---

In a letter to director of new and renewable energy Aleixo da Costa, it has pointed out that the very purpose of calling for comments and suggestions is to get maximum feedback from all the stakeholders and the general public. ‚ÄúIt is crucial that there is good public participation in giving feedback on this very important policy which will impact the whole of Goa. However, to give comments or suggestions it is important for consumers to read and understand the document,‚Äù Goacan co-ordinator Roland Martins said. The policy document states that electric two wheelers, e-cars, electric auto rickshaws, electric buses and goods carriers will be introduced in Goa and the department of new and renewable energy wishes to make Goa a model state in electric vehicles. Goacan said that the common practice is to give at least 30 days for people to submit feedback but by giving a deadline of August 2, the government has given just 25 days. ‚ÄúTherefore, an extension of time of 30 days from the date when the translated document is uploaded on the official website of the state government must be provided,‚Äù Martins said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/translate-draft-electric-mobility-policy-in-konkani-for-feedback/articleshow/84305251.cms||‡§ü‡§æ‡§á‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º ‡§®‡•á‡§ü‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï

A police officer identified the convict as S Padmanaban, a resident of Masakkalipalayam.

Besides, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi tweeted about the incident, saying, ‚ÄúThe BJP crossed all limits to stop the nomination of a woman.‚Äù In one of the two new videos, cops can be seen trying to save the candidate from rival party workers who were manhandling her and trying to push her out of the nomination room.

Meanwhile, National Commission for Women (NCW) chairperson Rekha Sharma wrote to the UP director-general of police asking him to intervene and take strict action against the accused. ‚ÄúA few years ago, a rape victim raised her voice against a BJP MLA and attempts were made to kill her and her family. Today, the BJP crossed all limits to stop the nomination of a woman,‚Äù Priyanka said in a tweet while sharing a video that purportedly showed Ritu Singh being stopped from filing her nomination in the polls. Ritu said, ‚ÄúEveryone is aware that all this happened just to ensure that a person close to a ruling party could win unopposed. I want a re-poll as my nomination form was snatched from the returning officer (RO) after I submitted it. It was a failure at the end of the State Election Commission and district administration. If I will not get justice here then I will approach the judiciary.‚Äù Police had registered an FIR late on Thursday, in which Yash Verma, Brij Kishore and several unidentified BJP workers were booked under IPC‚Äôs sections of ‚Äúrioting, robbery and attempting to outrage the modesty of a woman‚Äù along with section 171-F (undue influence or personation at an election).

The All India Jet Airways Officers and Staff Association sent a letter recently to the new civil aviation minister, labour minister and the regional labour commissioner. ‚ÄúOn preliminary perusal of the resolution plan, we found no reference to the claims of the employees. A very paltry amount has been proposed as a resolution in the insolvency and bankruptcy process. The company over its 26 years of existence has a large work force and many of them have worked for long parts of their lives,‚Äù it said. Jet Airways owes an undisputed sum of Rs 15,400 crore to its creditors, out of which Rs 1,254 crore is owed to its workers and employees in the form of unpaid salaries, gratuity etc. A Jet staffer said, ‚ÄúJet owes each commander about Rs 85 lakh and about Rs 3 lakh to the lowest paid employee. The quantum that the workers stand to lose under the resolution plan is shocking.‚Äù The cash payment proposed by Kalrock-Jalan for each worker is a token sum of Rs 11,000 and then Rs 5,100 towards medical reimbursements for workmen‚Äôs parents, Rs 6,200 as reimbursement for workmen‚Äôs children and a one-time mobile recharge of Rs 500.

VBBA convenor, Shekhar Shirodkar said the evidence they have gathered makes it clear that there was no linear wall at the site and the hotel had sought permission from the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) for repair of a gadga wall in 2017. The GCZMA website clearly refers to the gadga wall in information about the agenda for the coastal body‚Äôs meeting and no reference is made to linear wall, as claimed by the resort, Shirodkar said. Producing papers to back their statements, VBBA said the illegal encroachment should be demolished within 15 days or it would take recourse to other means to ensure it is cleared from the beach. Pundalik Raiker, legal adviser to VBBA stated that the illegal wall on Vainguinim has altered the beach and its further destruction should be halted immediately. When the construction was first taken up, Bhanu Shirodkar, a Taleigao resident and Vainguinim Valley Residents‚Äô Association had complained to authorities, alleging that it is being constructed illegally.

A week after TOI published a series of stories of children from needy families affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, a host of organisations and individuals have come forward to make their lives a tad easier. While some individuals brought out their wallets, with a rider that their identities not be revealed, a few organisations have gone all out to ensure that the children do not stop their online schooling. Project Mumbai, a city-based non-profit, will create fixed deposits in the names of each of the six children whose stories were reported in TOI, with a lock-in till they turn 18, said its founder and chief executive officer Shishir Joshi. They will also be given cellphones or tabs, where need exists, with internet data and the school curriculum uploaded. The NGO, which bagged the UN award for its Covid relief work, plays a catalyst in its mission to help the needy, especially children, by calling for help from citizens. ‚ÄúChildren from needy families are the worst hit in these times. Nearly 12,000 children across Maharashtra alone have lost at least one parent. Of these, over 400 have lost both parents,‚Äù Joshi said, adding that the overall situation impacts a child psychologically too. GiveIndia has rolled out a fundraiser called ‚ÄòTeam for Humanity‚Äô to help bring in donations for families that have lost the breadwinner. The fundraiser event, which stretches over six months, has individuals as well as celebrities chipping in for the cause. ‚ÄúThe families featured in TOI will be offered a one-time amount of Rs 30,000 each,‚Äù a spokesperson for GiveIndia said, adding donors can get details online. Dharavi alone has thousands of children wanting to resume school. To help them pick up their books again, Centre for Transforming India has launched an initiative titled ‚ÄòSchool on Tab‚Äô to make available 1,000 digital kits with connectivity. Earlier this month, the first batch of 50 children was handed a tab each, said Sapna Kar, project advisor for the initiative that aims to bridge the digital divide for children who live in the slums. ‚ÄúAnother 100 kids will be given tabs in the next batch. Each child gets a tab with 1GB storage,‚Äù Kar said, adding that another 700 children are still in need of tabs. ‚ÄúThe tabs are not at all conducive for gaming so that the gadgets are used for the intended purpose of schooling.‚Äù Mumbai seems to have come together to ensure that the pandemic does not push children into statistical figures of ‚Äòschool dropouts‚Äô or, worse still, that dark dungeon of child labour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/from-fds-to-tabs-people-loosen-purse-strings-for-pandemic-hit-kids/articleshow/84308485.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Ahead of festive season, traders seek easing of time curbs to check rush||BHOPAL: With the festival season round the corner, controlling crowds in the markets should be a matter of concern for the district administration, particularly in the wake of apprehensions being expressed that the third Coronavirus wave could hit the nation sooner than the latter. In 2020, the entire festival season passed without festivities due to lockdown restrictions and when the restrictions were eased during Diwali, the cases had started rising soon after though the situation was brought under control early. This year, Devshayani Ashadhi Ekadashi, which will be celebrated later this month, would herald the Indian festival season with the auspicious month of Sawan following thereafter, bringing with it a string of festivals like Janmashtami, Nagpanchami and Rakshabandhan. Traders TOI talked to on how the crowds in the markets could be controlled suggested crowds in the markets is natural as it is the marriage season till July 15 followed by festivals falling in the month of Sawan. They also suggested that the only solution to reduce the crowds in the markets is to distribute them by increasing timings of the market to 10pm or even 11pm from the existing 8pm. They also cite the example of Indore in this regard, where markets now close at 11.00 pm. The traders' organisations have also given a memorandum to the district administration for this purpose. But, the district administration thinks otherwise. Additional collector, Dileep Yadav, when asked how the district administration proposed to control swelling crowds in the markets as the festival season arrives, said, ‚ÄúWe have kept restrictions in place to do it. The early closure of the markets at 8pm is one of those.restrictions.‚Äù When told that traders find early closure of markets as a major factor responsible for crowding of markets during evening hours and they have been demanding increasing the closure time to 10pm or 11 pm, he said "It's not true." He further said that as of now there is no proposal to raise the closure timing of markets to 10pm or 11pm either. Yadav said that Coronavirus cases in the city have come down to below 10 and at this point of time, they are not for any more restrictions until and unless the cases start rising again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/ahead-of-festive-season-traders-seek-easing-of-time-curbs-to-check-rush/articleshow/84305265.cms||---

The college will also give free laptops to them. ‚ÄúThe pandemic has come as a dark shadow to innumerable happy lives and many families have lost their breadwinners, leaving the remaining members in unprecedented situations and financial crises. We have identified 15 such students who have no earning member left in their family and it will be difficult for them to continue their education. Hence, we are doing our bit,‚Äù said Ravindra Kumar Gupta, principal of the college. Gupta said that the college would provide laptops to such students, so that they could smoothly join online classes. The college will waive off all their fees and even bear the cost of the fees that a student has to pay at the university level. ‚ÄúWe will provide them books for the whole semester, free stationery items and free bus pass facility after the college reopens.‚Äù A taskforce was recently formed to identify and support such students in the college. ‚ÄúThe taskforce has initiated a donation drive within different active committees of the college and the amount collected will be given to the families of such students. Any teaching and non-teaching staff of the college may come forward to help them,‚Äù said the principal. Basuki Nath Chaudhary, convener of the taskforce, said that ‚Äúthis is an unparalleled initiative taken by the college, which will not only financially help the students who have been devastated by the pandemic but will also establish very high moral values in the society.‚Äù Earlier, Delhi University had asked its affiliated colleges to support students who have had their parents affected by Covid. DU vice-chancellor PC Joshi said, ‚ÄúWe told the colleges that any student who is suffering should get a fee waiver. Our dean of colleges Balaram Pani is taking the initiative. It‚Äôs good that PGDAV (evening) has come forward for a noble cause.

Competitive exams for state and Union government jobs will also be allowed, but agencies conducting the tests must inform district collectors in advance. Interstate public and private transport and international air travel, except the ones permitted by the Union home ministry, however, will continue to remain prohibited. Curbs on cinema theatres, bars, swimming pools, social and political gatherings, entertainment, sports and cultural events, schools and colleges and zoological parks too will remain intact.

Restaurants, tea shops, bakeries, eateries, sweet shops will be permitted with a 50% cap on customers at a time till 9pm. ‚ÄúStandard operating procedures should be followed strictly at all shops and public gatherings,‚Äù the CM said. Even as the total positive rate is falling, the state government wants to remain cautious. ‚ÄúThe state is still not in a comfort zone to open up fully,‚Äù said a senior official. Hand sanitizers and dispensers should be compulsorily made available at the entry and customers screened using thermal screening. Management should ensure that staff and customers wear masks at all times. Doors and windows should be kept open in shops with air-conditioning facilities to ensure adequate ventilation. Entry should be restricted to maintain social distance, while marking should be drawn for the customers to maintain distance when they stand in queue near shops. ‚ÄúThe district collectors and local bodies will have to take up intensive preventive measures through micro-level containment of cases,‚Äù he said. No other activities other than medical emergency services and supply of essential commodities will be permitted in the containment zones. The administrative machinery should set up committees and take up aggressive door-to-door monitoring in these zones. Stalin urged the public to avoid stepping out of houses and gather in public places to prevent the infectious disease. ‚ÄúWearing masks, maintaining social distance and frequent hand washing should be strictly followed. Public should visit hospitals nearby for consultation or treatment as soon as they get to know of the symptoms,‚Äù Stalin said.

The opponent won by 1.5 lakh votes in the Athoor assembly constituency. Chepauk constituency presented a similar fate. We lost four lakh votes in just four constituencies. Where are we positioned now? You must ponder over it and understand. We are not united. Since we are not united, we are suffering now,‚Äù Shanmugam told party workers at Marakkanam in Villupuram district. An audio of the address surfaced on social media. He, however, said it was his ‚Äúpersonal view‚Äù that the party lost the polls because of the alliance with the BJP. He maintained that he would abide by any decision taken by the party leadership on alliance with the BJP. On Thursday, Shanmugam told reporters at Gingee that his comments were distorted by the media. ‚ÄúThe reason I cited for the party‚Äôs loss is a personal view. We used to raise various issues in our party meetings, but we will finally abide by the decision taken by the party leadership,‚Äù he said.

---||Goa||Next wave possible if new variant emerges, say Goa experts||PANAJI: During the past fortnight, Goa‚Äôs Covid-19 graph seems to have plateaued at 150-250 cases, but the state may see a rise in August-September. It may not be substantial considering that a large section of the population will be vaccinated by then, provided that no new severe variant emerges. ‚ÄúIt appears that our cases have plateaued somewhere between 150 to 250 cases a day. Personally, if you ask me, even I‚Äôm waiting for these numbers to come down,‚Äù state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said. Even though cases are low now, it is expected that in August and September there will be some activity in terms of cases increasing. ‚ÄúIt is difficult to say at this juncture the extent of the rise in cases that we may see. If people had not been vaccinated, I would say, the increase would be significant. But since our vaccination has gone very well, the potential increase in cases may not be high, but there shouldn‚Äôt be any new severe variant,‚Äù Betodakar said. He said it is not an easy task to predict what would be the scenario in the event any other new variant makes its way. So far, of the total of 120 samples tested to find out Covid variants ‚Äì since the beginning of the second wave ‚Äì 109 had delta strain, ten kappa and an alpha. The good part is, he said, the state conducts a large number of tests every day. On an average, 4,000 to 5,000 tests are done daily, including 1,000-1,500 at border check posts. The state‚Äôs case positivity rate has fallen below 5% over the past week ‚ÄúWe are not doing unnecessary tests. We are covering the target population even at border check posts,‚Äù he said. It‚Äôs mandatory for travellers coming to Goa that they either come with a Covid negative certificate or get tested at border check posts. Though places such as Margao, Ponda, Cortalim and Ponda have seen a gradual rise in cases in the last few days, he said, it may be because many members in a family testing positive. ‚ÄúSuppose, ten members in a family test positive, the case tally of the whole area goes up. Though a rise is seen in certain areas it is negligible. The ups and down noticed in the weekly average has been minimal,‚Äù he said. It is advisable that a weekly average is counted rather than a daily count. If an unusual rise is noticed it will be immediately brought to the notice of the government, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/next-wave-possible-if-new-variant-emerges/articleshow/84305278.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Dhami meets PM with request for new AIIMS in Kumaon||Dehradun: During his visit to the national capital as chief minister, Pushkar Singh Dhami met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. Sources said that the meeting, initially scheduled for 15 minutes, lasted 75 minutes. Dhami requested the PM for an AIIMS ‚Äì on lines of the existing one at Rishikesh ‚Äì for the Kumaon region, as it would cater to a high number of people in the region. The CM is said to have told the PM that required land for such an institution was there, which can be immediately provided if the project is approved. Besides, Dhami told the PM that a sum of Rs 108 crore would be used for construction projects at Kedarnath, which would start shortly in the second phase of development process, and requested him to virtually lay foundation stones for these. The CM also requested the PM for the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs‚Äô approval for the Lakhwar Multipurpose Project. The Centre and six states - Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh ‚Äì had signed an MoU in 2018 for the 300 MW hydropower plant on Yamuna so all these states could avert water crisis in the future. The project has got all approvals except that of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs. Dhami said construction work will start on the project as soon as the approval is received. Afterwards, Dhami met Union home minister Amit Shah and requested to remove Niti Valley and Nelong Valley (Jadung village) of Uttarkashi from the inner line limits. The inner line permit (ILP) is a British-era system, under which outsiders visiting an area under the ILP will need permission from authorities and will be able to stay for a pre-specified time. The ILP is currently in force in northeastern states like Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram. The CM also requested the home minister for permission to set up a Disaster Management Research Institute in Gairsain, for air ambulance facility in the state and for moving residents of disaster-affected villages under SDRF funds. He also sought permission for a provision on the local level to declare people missing in disasters as dead. He requested to split expenditure on central security forces deployed in the state during renowned fairs and occasions in a 90: 10 ratio, like it is done in north eastern and special category states. In view of limited financial resources of the state, the CM also requested for exemption of Rs 47.29 crore pending dues for the deployment of central security forces in the state from time to time. The CM urged to pay special attention to the situation of the hill states while preparing the guidelines for the State Disaster Risk Management Fund components. Dhami also met Union minister of housing and urban affairs Hardeep Puri and requested to increase the budget allocation of Uttarakhand from Rs 89 crore to Rs 150 crore for solid waste management projects under Swachh Bharat Mission-2. The CM urged to release the remaining share of the Centre for the processing and disposal schemes of 08 legacy waste and old dump sites of the seven municipal bodies of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dhami-meets-pm-with-request-for-new-aiims-in-kumaon/articleshow/84301711.cms||Kautilya Singh

The ED has issued notices to the four banks, including Pune District Central Co-op Bank Ltd, where Pawar was a director. The ED is investigating the Rs 750 crore loan granted by the banks to Jarandeshwar Sahakari Sugar Karkhana (Jarandeshwar SSK). The Jarandeshwar SSK was purchased by Guru Commodity Services Pvt Ltd. It immediately leased Jarandeshwar SSK to Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt Ltd. A part of the funds utilised towards purchase of the mill was received from Sparkling Soil Pvt Ltd, a company related to Pawar and his wife, the ED had said. The ED saidJarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt Ltd and Guru Commodity Services Pvt Ltd were only a proxy owner of Jarandeshwar SSK and actual control rested with Sparkling Soil Pvt Ltd. Within a month of leasing out the mill, the Pune District Central Cooperative Bank, in which Pawar was one of the directors, had sanctioned Rs 100 crore loan to Jarandeshwar SSK. After a span of a few years, an additional Rs 650 crore loan was granted to Jarandeshwar SSK by Pune DCCB and other banks. The ED is trying to trace the financial trail. The ED is investigating a money laundering case connected with the Maharashtra State Co-Op Bank (MSCB). It suspects the Rs 750 crore loans taken by Jarandeshwar SSK were diverted for purposes other than declared to the bank. It was alleged that MSCB officials sanctioned loans to sick sugar mills and on default auctioned the assets. It is suspected that the MSCB officials ensured that their relatives or close associates bought the assets at the auction at throwaway prices. The ED said that while a developer from the city, Omkar Group, had floated the Guru Commodity Services Pvt Ltd by contributing around Rs 29 crore, Rs 10 crore came from another city developer, Shivalik Ventures. The remaining money was arranged by the Pawar-controlled company to purchase the Jarandeshwar SSK for Rs 60 crore in 2010, the ED had said. The ED has attached Jarandeshwar SSK sugar mill and the attachment notice stated that the auction was carried out in a way that the same could be purchased at an undervalued price by Guru Commodity, which was allegedly a dummy company operated by the Omkar Group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-750cr-bank-loans-to-sugar-mill-linked-to-dy-cm-under-ed-lens/articleshow/84307133.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Pune||Maharashtra allocated 1.15 crore Covid vaccine doses for month, wants 1.5 crore||PUNE: All 12 crore Covid vaccine doses for July have been distributed fairly among states (depending on population size) and demands for more will have to wait until supply improves, health ministry officials have said. ‚ÄúUttar Pradesh is followed by Maharashtra, Bihar and West Bengal in vaccine allocation,‚Äù an official from the ministry said. On Friday, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had said unless supply from the Centre improves, the state would not be able to streamline its vaccination programme. Maharashtra has been allocated 1.15 crore doses for July. It has asked for 1.5 crore doses. Officials in key state districts, including Pune, have said that their target of more than one lakh daily vaccinations completely depends on how much the central government sends. On a few days this week, drives at several civic run sites in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad were impacted due to limited supply. The health ministry official, when asked about the state‚Äôs request, said any addition to its allocated supply will lead to gaps in supply and demand in other states. The official said, ‚ÄúGap in (vaccine) demand and supply is a global issue. Current vaccine manufacturers have increased their production by four times, but demand has gone up too. That's why we started with priority groups (health and frontline workers), followed by vulnerable groups and then moved on to 45-plus and 18-plus groups.‚Äù The official said the Centre is not doubting Maharashtra's ability to ramp up its vaccine drive, but is currently unable to send more doses as supplies are still limited. ‚ÄúA vaccine is a biological product and has to undergo the necessary checks before distribution. Even if states demand immediate supplies, these processes have to be carried out, which will delay the supply. Consistent quality of the supply has to be ensured and that takes time,‚Äù the official, who didn't wish to be named, said. He said that vaccine ‚Äúeagerness‚Äù has increased after the second wave, adding that production has been improved to match the new levels of demand. ‚ÄúVaccine production has been increased from 2.5 crore to 12 crore. Work is on on all fronts. We are also adding vaccines from more manufacturers. But all this will take time. By next month, we will see supply improving further,‚Äù the official said. Vaccines from foreign manufacturers Moderna and Pfizer are expected to land soon in the country. At least 30 crore doses of the Biological E jab are also part of the Centre's supply plan for the rest of the year. Other central officials also confirmed that the Union government is committed to allocating 50 crore doses till Julyend and 135 crore between August and December. Authorities are also expecting daily vaccinations in the country to increase from 50 lakh to a crore. India has administered over 7.7 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses since rolling out its revamped central vaccination policy on June 21, with an average of 51.6 lakh inoculations per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-allocated-1-15cr-doses-for-month-wants-1-5cr/articleshow/84305345.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Rajkot||Date-to-riches stories inspire Banaskantha tillers||Palanpur: A progressive horticulture farmer‚Äôs tryst with tissue culture is reaping him riches literally with record earning of Rs 1 crore annually! Meet Anadabhai Bhimjibhai Patel of Budhanpur village of Tharad taluka in Banaskantha who has made his orchard of fruits a sweet journey of farming excellence. Together with the know-how provided by Dantiwada Sardar Krushi University (SDAU), and of course, Patel‚Äôs own enthusiasm makes him a classic example of how a tiller can combine improvisation with initiative and make it a revolutionized wonder. ‚ÄúAnadabhai owns 64 bighas (40 acres) of farmland on which he grows pomegranate, papaya, ‚Äúapple ber‚Äù and ‚Äòkharek‚Äô or the Israeli dates. ‚ÄúA date plant sapling costs Patel Rs 3,800, of which, he gets a subsidy of Rs 1,250 from the state government. His overall earnings annually is more than Rs 1 crore,‚Äù Jignesh B Suthar, district horticulture officer told TOI.‚ÄúI have been getting earning consistently more than Rs 1 crore annually since 2017. We also engage about 15 labourers and their monthly remuneration totals to about Rs 2 lakh,‚Äù informed Patel. Patel‚Äôs scintillating annual turnover is a record of sorts in the horticulture area, as on an average Gujarat farmers earn around Rs 43,000 annually, which is why they are trapped in the vicious cycle of poverty. The turning point in his life had come when he wanted to grow other fruits too along with date through tissue culture in 2005. This type of tissue culture method of farming was introduced by scientists of SDAU, following a call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for self-sufficiency as the then state‚Äôs chief minister. Banaskantha horticulture division as well as SDAU provided Patel with more information that helped bring about a dramatic change in his outlook and he began to grow several fruits and flowers with spectacular results.Date farming needs a proper supply of water, for which Patel had made suitable arrangements in 2001 and has been holding him steady for all these years. Patel‚Äôs two brothers are also involved in date farming and all are happy with their progress. A date plant requires 4x3 feet pit and fertilisers like cowdung manure have to be added before planting a sapling. To save water, Patel uses drip irrigation which also reduces not only labour charges greatly, but also in consumption of water.What is special about Patel‚Äôs dates is that it is of Israeli variety and the whole process of growing it through organic farming has made it more beneficial for health. Patel has 300 date palms, of which, he first earned Rs 9 lakh. This steadily rose to Rs 15 lakh. Dates sell at Rs 60 to Rs 80 per kg in the market and Patel is now expecting a revenue of Rs 25 lakh from dates alone. Interestingly date farming can lead to intercrop farming which led Patel to also grow ‚Äúapple ber‚Äù, which has netted him an additional annual income of Rs 5 lakh.Such success stories have been a great inspiration for many more of his ilk in the Vav-Tharad area. Banaskantha, known for its potato cultivation primarily, is now turning into a hub for date farming thanks to the ingenuity and enterprise shown by farmers like Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/date-to-riches-stories-inspire-banaskantha-tillers/articleshow/84303437.cms||---

The minister said that the government will disclose the proposals in the upcoming demand for grants session for the municipal administration department in the state assembly. ‚ÄúWe have proposed for the restoration of Cooum river, Buckingham canal and Adyar river in Chennai. To avoid mosquito proliferation and discharge of wastewater, we will prepare a detailed project report,‚Äù the minister added. After Trichy Corporation was expanded to 65 wards in 2011, there was a persistent demand to expand the city‚Äôs jurisdiction further to 100 wards. Earlier, Nehru inaugurated Miyawaki mini forest with walking tracks established by the Lalgudi revenue department in Poonampalayam near Manchanallur. In Mandurai, he launched a drive to plant one lakh native tree saplings using MGNREGA workers. Nehru said that available land will be utilised for increasing green cover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/nehru-hints-at-move-to-expand-corporations/articleshow/84305350.cms||---

Out of a total of 900 MGD of water consumed by the capital, approximately 100 MGD of water has been allegedly curtailed by the Haryana government. Interestingly, on Friday, Gupta announced that if the ‚Äúsevere water crisis‚Äù in the capital was not resolved in the next 48 hours, Delhi BJP would cut off the supply to the Delhi Jal Board chairman Satyendra Jain‚Äôs residence. In a press conference, Bharadwaj stated that Haryana government had been repeatedly stalling Delhi‚Äôs water supply and the government has to often go to the courts for it. Stopping the water connection of Adesh Gupta‚Äôs house is the only way to bring them on the right track, the AAP functionary stated, claiming that around 20 lakh Delhiites were suffering due to lack of water due to Haryana government‚Äôs actions. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that the AAP is resorting to drama to cover its failure to ensure proper water supply.  ‚ÄúNot only Haryana, but Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand too are giving Delhi its complete share of water. Delhi government has gone to court as well against Haryana, but failed to prove its point in court,‚Äù Kapoor said, adding that the government has failed to check water pilferage and line leaks and has not been able to use full water treatment capacity of the capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-often-went-to-court-for-share-aap/articleshow/84305336.cms||---
---||Trichy||Those using temple property must become tenants: Min||Trichy: Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) minister P K Sekar Babu urged the people using HR&CE properties to come forward to become tenants and pay rent for the improvement of temple infrastructure across the state. Inspecting the Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam on Saturday, the minister said a new cow shelter is under the consideration within the temple campus. ‚ÄúIn 1866, during the British colonial rule, around 330 acres were entitled to the Srirangam temple. Only 24 acres of the 330 is now with the temple. The remaining areas have residential and commercial properties. If those using the temple land acknowledge and approach us, we will consider them as tenants,‚Äù said Sekar babu. A feasibility study for a new cow shelter within the campus of Srirangam temple to manage the surplus bovines donated by the devotees is under consideration, he added. The minister said enumeration is underway for identifying the state-maintained temples in various districts that are awaiting the holy consecration ceremony for years. Inspecting the Arulmigu Samaypuram Mariamman temple, the minister said the seven-tier Rajagopuram being established at a cost of Rs 3.15 crores will be painted soon. He also reviewed the progress of the queue complex in the Samayapuram temple campus coming up at a cost of Rs 13.80 crores. ‚ÄúThe existing vacancies in the department will be filled on compassionate ground appointments, the temporary staff who have completed five years of service will be made permanent,‚Äù the minister added.

The region must think beyond agriculture, engineering and fabrication industries to generate jobs. My longterm goal is to establish a manufacturing factory. I have been interacting with my contacts in this sector to make investments on the outskirts by employing the huge pool of educated and skilled youths available.You have been vocal about making Trichy the second capitalChennai is saturated. Since Trichy is the geographical centre of the state, people from all regions can reach here in about four hours. Connectivity makes the city an ideal choice. Developing infrastructure such as satellite administrative offices is possible as we have adequate land and water in the suburbs. Your plans on the long-pending demands of your constituencyFeasibility studies for decongesting the constituency through flyovers and widening viable roads without disturbing the public will be initiated. Land regularisation in core city is needed as the smart cities mission projects were not properly planned. My focus will be on the rope car facility for Rockfort temple, East Boulevard road development and Gandhi market‚Äôs modernisation. Trichy airport expansion is vital for encouraging exports for which I intend to frequently coordinate with senior ministers and fellow elected representatives.As first-time MLA, how far have you connected with people?I have completely covered half the corporation wards in my constituency in the past month to hear their grievances. I am taking corporation officials along during the field visits to offer on-the-spot solutions. Any specific plan for urban slums in your constituency?Will try to establish a skill development centre for unemployed youths to enrol for vocational training. They will get employment opportunities for the skills developed or they can be self-employed. Your solutions for civic woes?Listening to citizens, experts and officials and implementing viable solutions after thorough observation is the plan. To avoid inundation, RWH pits will be set up at vulnerable spots. For waste management, a pilot waste collection method using pushcarts and additional sanitary workers was implemented in ward 23. The model will be streamlined and replicated in other parts to avoid littering.

The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), which has already cut 365 big trees for constructing a road through layout of Maharashtra State Textile Corporation (MSTC), has now proposed a garden on sprawling 13,122 sq m land while private companies have planned commercial ventures on the huge plots. There are a large number of trees on these vacant lands. The 365 trees were cut even as MSTC is yet to give funds for construction of the road. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari and Central Nagpur MLA Vikas Kumbhare on Saturday performed bhoomi puja for construction of a compound wall for the proposed garden.‚ÄúI have planned Vande Mataram garden on the layout‚Äôs open space which will be dedicated to defence personnel. Murals of Param Vir Chakra recipients will be created at the garden, followed by various infrastructure related to working of defence sector. The garden has been planned to mark 75th Independence Day,‚Äù he said.MSTC‚Äôs layout comprises of open space of 9,841 sq m and public utility (PU) land of 3,281 sq m, for a total of 13,122 sq m. The garden has been proposed on open space and PU land. Design for the garden is being prepared, said Tiwari and added that efforts will be to accommodate as much as trees possible in the project. ‚ÄúFew trees are likely to be cut down, but it will be known only after the design is ready,‚Äù he said.The same layout had 380 trees on a part from where a 12 metre wide road is approved. The NMC proposed to construct 15 metre road. As per norms, the road is supposed to be developed after receipt of funds from the MSTC. MSTC is yet to give the funds, still the civic body completed tendering process in 2019 and Tree Authority gave permission to cut 365 trees.TOI visited the area and found that the NMC has chopped down 365 trees and cleared space for road‚Äôs construction. It was done immediately after getting approval from Tree Authority in January, as per NMC officials.On the layout area towards Rajwada Palace, some big trees have been cut and some work has commenced.Tiwari said that NMC will construct the road whenever MSTC will give funds. ‚ÄúWe are continuosly pursuing the matter with MSTC. We have also made provisions of funds in budget which will be utilized if MSTC refuses to give funds. The road is necessary for convenience of commuters,‚Äù he said.Part of the proposed road will have to be constructed for development of garden, followed by approach route.The MSTC had auctioned plot no. 1, 2 and 8 of the layout couple of years ago to Royal Sandesh Business Park LLP, Orange City Garment Park and Acharya Shree Vidyasagar Garment Vyapari Welfare Society, respectively. All these plots are huge and consist of large number of trees.According to the mayor, two companies had applied with the state government for change in user from existing industrial to commercial. ‚ÄúThe government has asked the NMC to put up the proposal,‚Äù he said.The companies had purchased the plots and proposed to develop commercial complexes. ---------------------------------------------------------GREENERY TO GO* After closure of Empress Mill, National Textile Corporation got layout approved from the NMC in 2004* Layout comprised of 12 metre wide road, eight plots, open space and PU land* Plot no. 3 to 7 were auctioned.

Some 2,969 people in this age group have received the Russian-made vaccine. Only about 302 beneficiaries (in the 45-59 group) and just 96 (in the above-60 group) have opted for Sputnik V. City hospitals offering Sputnik V said its short 21-day interval between doses, and the claimed efficacy of 92%, has been a big draw among the younger groups. Data also showed that Covishield makes up 92% of all jabs administered in Pune district. Covaxin contribution is 8% while Sputnik V ‚Äî the third shot ‚Äî currently has a share of 0.07%. Abrarali Dalal, the CEO of Sahyadri Hospitals said, ‚ÄúWe started Sputnik V vaccinations from our Hadapsar unit almost a week ago with 1,200 doses, which finished in about two days. There is definite enthusiasm for Sputnik V in the young working class. One of the reasons for the demand could be the fact that very few hospitals are offering it. We think the other reason is the short interval between doses (21 days).‚Äù Dalal said that the hospital had ordered another 15,000 doses, to be distributed among its Hadapsar, Nagar Road, Nashik and Karad branches. Other sources from Sahyadri said the chunk of the 18-44 group, which still has to be vaccinated, may be turning to the new shot. ‚ÄúThe Hadapsar unit is currently vaccinating an average of 500 people a day with Sputnik V. Youngsters from other districts, including Ahmednagar, Mumbai and others, are coming to Pune for the shot. Perhaps, they think it‚Äôs more convenient to get it from here,‚Äù a hospital source said. District immunization officer Dr Sachin Edake said, ‚ÄúThe younger population in the city had been waiting for Sputnik V to arrive at vaccination centres. They seem to be more eager to try newer vaccines.‚Äù Rekha Dubey, CEO of the Aditya Birla Memorial Hospital said, ‚ÄúDemand for Sputnik V is currently at levels Covishield was at when the vaccination drives started. However, we are seeing demand for the Russian shot from all age groups, with an average of 300 to 400 vaccinations daily.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/large-chunk-of-sputnik-v-recipients-from-18-group/articleshow/84305374.cms||Neha Madaan

Most of the pilgrims, according to locals, are coming from neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi. Consequently, the parking lots in Haridwar have been full for the past few days. They added that checking of RT-PCR reports is also not being done stringently. Even the evening aarti at the ghat is drawing huge crowds and people can be seen sitting next to each other on the steps of the ghat without any social distancing being practised. On Saturday evening, when the crowds at the evening aarti had reached capacity point, police had to barricade the area to prevent more people from entering the ghat. All of this, as per locals, is leading to a situation where the spread of the virus can recur. Sharvan Jha, a Haridwar resident, told TOI, ‚ÄúHaridwar is recording a massive influx of pilgrims and tourists from other states. However, in the past few days, there have been multiple incidents of violations of Covid-19 guidelines at the Har-Ki-Pauri ghat. While the district administration claims that no tourist is being allowed entry into Haridwar without a Covid-19 negative report, many people are crossing borders without having to go through any scrutiny.‚Äù On Saturday, a few tourists who were creating a ruckus at the Har-ki-Pauri ghat were also arrested by the police. Senthil Avoodai Krishna Raj S, Haridwar SSP, told TOI, ‚ÄúPenalty is being imposed on the people violating Covid-19 protocols at the Har-ki-Pauri ghat.

UIDAI informed the Gujarat high court that the HC can order it to furnish information only after hearing the authority and the person whose information is being sought for. The Aadhaar authority‚Äôs insistence perplexed the HC which directed UIDAI on Wednesday to cooperate with the police in its investigation into the disappearance of Jadav after 10 years. Jadav had mysteriously disappeared in 2011. In March, the HC directed the police to launch a probe and ordered UIDAI to cooperate.

Kunte said representatives of various industries should discuss the matter with their respective District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMA). ‚ÄúThe basic outline has been drawn by the state, but the local authorities should incorporate protocols, depending on the local situation,‚Äù Kunte told TOI. ‚ÄúStaggered timings for operations or bio-bubbles, which minimise the risk of Covid infection, should be adopted by the industries. This should be the base of the plan. Collectors or DDMAs understand the local conditions better and they should draw up the plan following the state-level guidelines,‚Äù said Kunte, adding the collectors would have to talk to the respective industry heads to chalk out the final plan. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a meeting conducted recently had directed the district collectors to chart out a plan to ensure industries could operate amid a possible third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Mohan Gurnani, the chairman of the Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT), told TOI that they were well aware of the dangers lurking in the current pandemic and that some smaller trades were deeply affected by it. ‚ÄúThere is a need to strike a balance between the two. While adequate protection should be taken, the economic activities have to start. It is imperative for the state government to give effective working hours to small traders. At present, it is mostly 7am to 4pm. It should be revised, say from 11am to 5pm or 6 pm.

The report compiled and released by the department of school education and literacy, Government of India, revealed that 5.02%, or 1,170 schools out of a total of 23, 295 schools in Uttarakhand didn‚Äôt have a functional toilet on their campus. The report also found that 9.05% of all the schools in the state didn‚Äôt have a functional drinking water facility. Out of 2,109 schools with no drinking water facility, more than 1,800 schools, or 85%, are run by the government -- both central and state governments. Uttarakhand schools scored better on hygiene with the majority, more than 93% of all schools, providing hand wash facilities to students. Just over 6% of all schools did not have this facility. But in a more worrying trend, the report highlighted that more than 16% of all schools in the state didn‚Äôt have an electricity connection. When it comes to the number of schools with internet facilities, only 16.67% of all schools in Uttarakhand are equipped with it, which means that more than 19,000 schools in the state are yet to be connected with the internet. On a national level, the internet was available in 22.3% of all schools in 2019-20. Just 8,000 schools have a functional computer facility, which means that more than 65% are yet to be equipped with computers. Nationally, 38.5% of all schools in India have computer facilities. Although educationists maintained that the Himalayan state had performed better than many other states in infrastructure related parameters, a lot more needs to be done. An official in the state education department told TOI, ‚ÄúWe have outperformed many big states on several parameters and we are continuously working to further improve school education infrastructure in the state. But one should also look at the SDG index report prepared by the Niti Aayog, where Uttarakhand was given the fourth spot among all the states in providing quality education.‚Äù The state‚Äôs performance in GER or the Gross Enrollment Ratio for classes 11 and 12 is a decent 69.3, higher than the national average 51.4, and the GER for girls in higher secondary classes is more than that of boys. Moreover, the state‚Äôs performance in pupil-teacher-ratio (PTR) has been better than the national average. It was found to be in the range of 13.8-18.5 across all levels, from primary to higher secondary, while the national PTR was in the range of 18.5-26.5. A lower PTR indicates better quality of teaching.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-1000-schools-in-uttarakhand-without-toilets-finds-central-govt-report/articleshow/84301876.cms||Mohammad Anab

No zika virus cases were detected in the state in the past even when they were found in other states. ‚ÄúThe National Vector Borne Disease Control (NVBDC) section throughout the year runs a programme for prevention and control of aedes mosquito. Goa has been doing wonderfully as far mosquito control is concerned,‚Äù state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said. Despite this, he said, all health centres have been asked to monitor the situation in their areas. The zika virus is spread by infected aedes mosquito species. ‚ÄúThe samples of unusual cases that will be reported by health centres or patients referred to a hospital, either private or government, will be sent for testing to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune,‚Äù he said. Rajasthan, Gujarat, some northern parts of Maharashtra and few other states report zika cases throughout the year. Another health official said that while zika cases have not been reported in the state so far, the NVBDS has has been running continuous programmes for the prevention of malaria and dengue, and ensures that spots or areas that can serve as breeding grounds are destroyed. The state has been able to successfully bring down the number of malaria cases, the officer said. Dengue is caused by an infected aedes aegypti, and though there is a rise in the number of cases that have been reported in the past three to four years, no outbreak has been reported from any area. The reported cases are sporadic, the officer said.

Forest officials are monitoring the OF area constantly but so far no confirmation of leopard‚Äôs movement in that zone has been reported. Hada said ‚ÄúOF land is vast, probably around a thousand hectares. There is a part which is uninhabited and that is probably where the leopard must have visited. We feel it might have already gone back to the forest, but are awaiting confirmation.‚Äù Another theory is that this particular leopard may be regularly visiting the uninhabited part for which it may have passed through areas where human movement is common. Earlier reports of leopard being sighted in IT Park had put the city on high alert, but Hada says there is no evidence to link the OF leopard. ‚ÄúIn Nagpur city, we never found any pugmarks. So, there is no way to confirm whether this was the same big cat,‚Äù said Hada. Also, the reason for this repeated movement outside of Ambazari is not know. Hada said, ‚ÄúThere is enough prey base in Ambazari and more than one leopard can exist there.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/of-leopard-likely-to-be-one-sighted-at-ambazari-last-month/articleshow/84301868.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

A video showing a jubilant beer bar operator carrying out ‚Äòaarti‚Äô of Chandrapur guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar ‚Äî who is seen as the architect of revocation of prohibition ‚Äî was doing the rounds. Former liquor licence holders have started renewing the suspended excise permits of their liquor outlets and beer bars. The state excise department has issued 308 liquor permits so far. Liquor sale is at an all-time high at all the outlets and beer bars across the district, and sellers are thankful to Wadettiwar for his initiative to withdraw the prohibition. There is such euphoria over withdrawal of the ban that people have started venerating Wadettiwar for his deed. The beer bar operator seen in the video went to the extent of carrying out aarti of a picture (portrait) of Wadettiwar in a reputed bar and restaurant located at Lohara, some eight km from the city, as a gesture of gratitude. The man in the video is identified as one Ganesh Goradwar. The video pans out to show the shelf holding liquor bottles in the bar where aarti was performed. The video posted on social media has drawn a slew of comments, some censuring and others ridiculing the act of the man. Call made to Wadettiwar to seek his reaction on the viral video went unanswered. Meanwhile, instances of liquor being sold at rates higher than the maximum retail price (MRP) printed on the bottles after revocation of prohibition have come to fore in the district. Following multiple complaints received to this effect, the state excise department is set to launch a drive to curb the practice in authorized liquor shops and beer shops.Soon after state excise department cleared the licences, many beer bars, beer shops, country liquor and foreign liquor shops were started across the district. Even after a week, a large crowd of tipplers continues to throng these places following the Covid curfew after 4 pm. Taking advantage of the same, these authorized liquor sellers have started selling liquor bottles at rates higher than the MRP.Excise department officials said they will take action as per law for such violations. There are also complaints about liquor being sold to customers having no liquor drinking permits. The excise department is also keen on checking the sale registers of the liquor sellers to verify how liquor was sold to so many people without drinking permits.The catch is that all the liquor consumption licences in Chandrapur (including the lifetime permits) had lapsed after liquor was banned in Chandrapur in 2015. As the excise department did not issue any fresh liquor drinking permits after prohibition was revoked, legally no person is authorized to purchase liquor in Chandrapur. Still, all the bars and shops have bumper sales every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/overjoyed-bar-owner-carries-out-aarti-of-wadettiwar-for-lifting-liquor-ban/articleshow/84301903.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Rajkot||Mandatory hallmark leads to huge gold inventory pile-up across Gujarat||RAJKOT: After the new law, making hallmarking of gold jewellery compulsory from June 16 came into force, hallmarking centres across Gujarat have been facing a huge pile up of inventory. The government has fixed the August 1 deadline to get backlog stock to get hallmarked. Rajkot, the hub of lightweight gold jewellery design in the country, is especially facing the toughest challenges implementing the order owing to its lengthy procedure which has stalled supply to other states as well as abroad. The city manufactures around 40 kg gold jewellery every day. Industry sources claim that 80 percent jewellers in Rajkot never got their ornaments hallmarked earlier. Hallmark gold is a sign of trust. But in making the mark mandatory, the labyrinthine process is proving to be very cumbersome for the jewellers. Estimates suggest that in a day, barely 10% of the orders are processed. ‚ÄúEarlier, we used to process an estimated 2,000 requests in a day, but now we barely manage some 150 orders,‚Äù said a well-placed source working with a hallmarking centre. Earlier, the centre had to randomly check gold carat from 10% articles in one lot. But now, they have to generate a six digit HUID (hallmark unique identification number) for each article from a BIS portal. ‚ÄúThe entire method of inspecting has gone online. We must upload all details like weight, volume, type of gold used, grammage and other information online on the BIS server. We cannot release it till we get the HUID number, which is taking time. As a consequence, there is significant piling up of gold at the hallmarking centres,‚Äù said the source. Bhayabhai Soni, who runs the biggest hallmark centre in Rajkot, said, ‚ÄúWe have to upload every detail on the portal and create job cards. We have to generate a minimum 400 mg scrap of one lot of jewellery and mention that detail too. The entire process takes nearly two hours and in one day we can hallmark only 50 pieces.‚Äù Soni, who is also president of Rajkot gold dealers association, further said that server problems add to the long hours. According to a rough estimate around 70 to 100 kg gold ornaments lie piled up waiting to get a hallmark in Rajkot. Industry associations seek ease in compliance of norms for hallmarking jewellery. Ramesh Lolaria, a consultant of jewellers on hallmark issues said, ‚ÄúWe have suggested to the government to take a declaration from the traders of stock before June 16 and allow these to be sold without a hallmark. This will clear the huge backlog and waiting period.‚Äù Divyesh Patadiya, president of Rajkot gems and jewellery association said, ‚ÄúBecause of this waiting period, we have to make advance planning so that we can deliver ornaments to customers for marriage or festival which requires huge investment. Small traders can‚Äôt afford such investments.‚Äù Jitendra Bhindi, a Junagadh jeweller who was part of the committee on hallmarking, said that the government is positive in addressing all the problems. ‚ÄúHUIN is definitely a serious issue and the government has already formed a separate committee to find a solution to that issue,‚Äù he said.

---||Mumbai||Blip in 2nd Covid wave? Maharashtra caseload in first 10 days of July over 79,500||MUMBAI: In the last 10 days, Maharashtra and Kerala, the two states synonymous with rising Covid trends in the last 16 months, reported 79,595 cases and 1.28 lakh cases respectively to once again emerge as the major contributors (53%) to the country‚Äôs daily Covid burden. In contrast, Delhi, where the second wave saw the daily caseload soar to 25,000-plus, has seen 817 cases between July 1 and 10. Many major cities have a two-digit daily tally. There is no scientific answer yet as to why Maharashtra and Kerala continue to post a high number of cases almost six months into the second wave, but theories abound. Public health officials in the two states say the high numbers are a testimony of their transparent system and accurate reporting. One theory is that these numbers indicate a ‚Äúblip‚Äù in the second wave. ‚ÄúThese states reported the first cases/clusters in the country during both peaks. The high cases now could indicate another rise in the Covid graph,‚Äù said a senior doctor from Mumbai who didn‚Äôt want to be identified. In Maharashtra, doctors point to the curious case of Kolhapur, where the second wave has possibly just peaked with daily cases over 3,000 for the last fortnight as against under 800 in Mumbai. ‚ÄúWe have begun referring to this district as the ‚ÄòKolhapur paradox‚Äô,‚Äù said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government‚Äôs task force on Covid-19. ‚ÄúIt has the highest vaccinated percentage of 70% in the entire state, but it has the highest daily test positivity of over 10%,‚Äù said Dr Joshi. The Kolhapur cases, according to officials, are being reported among younger people who haven‚Äôt been fully vaccinated yet. Epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu said both Kerala and Maharashtra have different reasons for their high numbers. ‚ÄúThere is an issue with home isolation in Kerala. People in isolation are spreading it to others at home,‚Äù he said. But the fact that Kerala has low hospitalisation rates and low deaths ‚Äì 1,254 between July 1 and 10 as against 3,089 in Maharashtra ‚Äì indicates awareness about reaching out for healthcare in time. ‚ÄúKerala also has better immunisation rates,‚Äù he said. Regarding Maharashtra, he said various districts have witnessed peaks at different times. The real concern, he said, is that higher numbers indicate the virus is very much in circulation. Maharashtra state officials said July cases so far have dropped to the pre-peak levels in March. The peak-time daily average of 60,000 cases has reduced to a tenth, but the plateau has the government worried. ‚ÄúThere are eight districts that continue to be a cause for concern,‚Äù said a state official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/blip-in-2nd-wave-maharashtra-caseload-in-first-10-days-of-july-over-79500/articleshow/84305517.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Nagpur||A step in the right direction: This herdsman is flocking kids to school||NAGPUR: Forced to migrate to Maharashtra more than four decades ago due to droughts in their home state, Bharwad herdsmen from Gujarat and their famed Gir cows are now very much a part of Vidarbha‚Äôs rural landscape. Among the second generation of migrants, Ramabhai Jograna was always concerned that despite years of having settled in the state, a large part of the community remains cut off from the mainstream. May be education can help them, he thought. In an attempt to educate the next generation of Bharwads, Jograna has opened a small chain of rural schools with his own might. The schools run right near the herdsmen‚Äô settlements, with teachers also settled close by. After starting with one school at Sonkhamb village in Nagpur‚Äôs Katol tehsil, he is set to open three more at villages in Umred, Hingna ana Saoner. The schools will be inaugurated on July 12. The schools have an arrangement with city NGO Learning Companion, where young persons interested to take up a career in education are engaged. The teachers, who come from different parts of the region, stay close to the schools, making themselves available on a daily basis. At present, the classes are from pre-primary to grade 4 and located close to different Bharwad settlements. The Bharwads may have given up their nomadic way of life, but even now they are settled away from the villages. ‚ÄúWe do have government schools in the villages but somehow the kids could not grasp the studies, may be the teachers are not very keen. The parents too, who are not educated, cannot assist them at home. I always wondered if some special arrangement could be made for our children,‚Äù said Jograna. ‚ÄúI finally got in touch with this NGO and they helped me start the schools. They are coming up at Badpipla in Saoner, Kuhiphata near Urmred and Asola village in Hingna. The teachers are local but have a different approach that suits us,‚Äù he says. Jograna also meets the day to day expenses of the teachers as they stay in the village itself. Jograna never missed a chance to discuss the problem with anyone resourceful he came across. Sajal Kulkarni, an activist who works with herdsmen, introduced him to the NGO. ‚ÄúWe have a system of training people who want to take up career in education. The NGO offers them a fellowship. The teachers are from different parts of the region who stay close to the community,‚Äù said Ganesh Birajdar of Learning Companion. The model not only provides exposure to the fellows but an opportunity to learn for the community members. Funding for the schools was raised through CSR activities of different companies. ‚ÄúJograna was keen to start the project and he approached us and we helped connect the dots,‚Äù said Prajakta Atul, one of the contributors. ‚ÄúThe children can speak broken Marathi but are comfortable with Hindi, which is also the medium of education. I have noticed that a number of children are rather good at mathematics. Their exposure to the bigger world is slowly increasing,‚Äù says Vrushab Khadse, a teacher who has already spent some time at the school in Sonkhambh. Jograna‚Äôs 17-year-old nephew Kalu is also keen to learn now. ‚ÄúSince we have a school here, we also take out time to learn to read and write,‚Äù he said Apart from education, Jograna says the community in Maharasthra also needs to get other basic facilities like Aadhaar cards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/a-step-in-the-right-direction-this-herdsman-is-flocking-kids-to-school/articleshow/84301924.cms||Shishir Arya

The movement of goods had been disrupted here due to a portion of Strand Road being cordoned off for demolition of the Vivekananda flyover. ‚ÄúKMDA has assured us that this section will be handed over to us by early next week,‚Äù said a senior Lalbazar officer. Six girders on this small section have been pulled down. Piers 12 and 13 will be demolished later. Opening of the stretch will give handcarts access to the trading hub in Posta-Burrabazar. A dozen vehicles can be parked now, solving Burrabazar‚Äôs long standing parking issues. ‚ÄúLoading and unloading of onions will start once KMDA removes the barricades as trucks to the onion mandi park here.

The association has also donated other equipment to the hospital. The lobby of the second floor has been converted into a pediatric casualty where children can be assessed separately and won‚Äôt have to queue up with other people. Here the doctors will decide whether the child requires admission or not. The second wave initially saw people queueing up for hours outside casualty with no triage being carried out. ‚ÄúThe equipment has been installed and infrastructure is completely ready and functional.

The company will be inaugurating the country‚Äôs first commercial LNG filling station in the city on Sunday. Located at the outer ring road towards Dighori, it has a capacity of 23 tons and will be catering to LNG driven vehicles along the national highways around Nagpur. At present, the only dispensation station is at Dahej in Gujarat. ‚ÄúThis will be the first-ever in the country to operate on a commercial basis,‚Äù said Subbarao Vaddadi, director of B-LNG, the fuel division of Baidyanath group. ‚ÄúThe company‚Äôs decision was following government‚Äôs decision to invest Rs10,000 crore in the LNG dispensing stations across the country,‚Äù he said. Nitin Gadkari, union transport minister and also the MP for Nagpur, who has always been pressing for alternate fuel, took the initiative to start the first set-up in the city. As the minister was looking for local companies to come forward, the Baidyanath group agreed and invested Rs 8 crore in the project. ‚ÄúThe station will be operational from Sunday. It will take 60 vehicles a day for the pump to operate feasibly,‚Äù said Vaddadi. For this, Baidyanath has plans to convert 120 vehicles which include buses and trucks into LNG. ‚ÄúThis will entail an investment Rs10 lakh per vehicle,‚Äù said Vaddadi. At present, it would start will 12 vehicles, he said. ‚ÄúLNG is not only being projected as a cheaper alternative to diesel but rates offered at the Nagpur station will be lower than the current market price of the fuel elsewhere. This is because the supply of a year has been booked at an advance rate due to which the fuel will be available at Rs 62 a liter as against Rs 72 in the market.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/baidyanath-to-start-countrys-first-commercial-lng-filling-station/articleshow/84301933.cms||Shishir Arya

The two had been living separately for the last six years. Angry over the victim‚Äôs refusal to come back to him, the accused killed her, police said.Police said that the killer Punit Mitna followed his wife Mamta (30) and killed her when she was on way to her uncle‚Äôs home in Umargam late on Thursday night. Mamta‚Äôs father Dalpat lodged a murder case against his son-in-law at Umargam Marine police station on Friday. Dalpat claimed that just before dying Mamta told him that Mitna had slit her throat and stabbed her multiple times. According to Dalpat, Mamta had left her husband around six years ago as Mitna used to harass her over suspicions of infidelity. Tired of the daily torment, Mamta had returned to her parents‚Äô home with her children. Dalpat told police that Mitna often came to their house and tried to convince Mamta to return to him, but she always refused. On Thursday night, when Mamta was going to her uncle Dhansukh‚Äôs home, Mitna followed her and attacked her near Sutharfaliya Road. After slitting her throat, he stabbed her before fleeing. Locals informed Dalpat about the attack following which Mamta was taken to a hospital in Bhilad from where she was referred to another hospital in Vapi. She succumbed to injuries during treatment at the hospital in Vapi.

Only a handful of church officials and sisters attended the mass following the Covid protocols though the mass was broadcast live on social media platforms. Prominent among those present were Fr Felix Toppo, archbishop of Ranchi, Fr Theodore Mascarenhas, Bishop of Ranchi, Fr Jerry Kuttina, provincial of Jamshedpur, Fr Santosh Minj, provincial of Hazaribagh among others. Leading the mass, Felix Toppo said, ‚ÄúLet us pray not only for our departed Fr Stan Swamy, but for the whole world." Fr Theodore Mascarenhas, in his homily, said, ‚ÄúFr Stan Swamy is no more on this earth. We could not receive his body because of the extraordinary situation arising out of the pandemic, but his ashes are here with us today. Today, we remember him with gratitude. In him, we had a courageous man, who was not afraid of anything. He was a man, loved by many, hated, persecuted and tortured by some, who finished his time on earth and returned to heaven and his eternal abode.‚Äù He further said, ‚ÄúThe way he was treated in prison -- an 84-year-old man, his hands shaking, could not even hold his simple glass of milk, yet he was denied a slipper for days, something that any ordinary human being would have simply been given. He was not an accused, yet he was denied basic facilities like a bed and a blanket. We can never forget this.‚Äù "What was his crime?‚Äù the Bishop asked and said, ‚ÄúFr Stan Swamy was not afraid of those who would touch his body. He was not afraid to fight for the rights of the underprivileged, tribals, Dalits and all those who needed his help. Those who hated him continued till they were sure that he had gone to his grave. When he was in court and very sick, there was so much reluctance to give him medical help. His last wish was -- ‚Äòlet me go back to my people‚Äô‚Äù Bishop Mascarenhas added, ‚ÄúWe do not condemn those who were involved for what they did to Fr Stan Swamy. We pray for forgiveness so that God may give us more sensitivity, make us more human so that this country lives in communal harmony where the rights of minorities, Adivasis and Dalits remain protected." Meanwhile, a prayer meeting and tribute offering were organised by the central zone of Jesuit Province at the Fr Michael Van den Bogaert SJ Memorial auditorium on the campus of Xavier Institute of Social Service (XISS). The prayer meet saw very few people in attendance because of the Covid-19 protocols. However, thousands from across the nation and even abroad watched it as it was streamed live. This prayer meeting was a joint effort of the Jesuits Conference of South Asia, Delhi, which is organising such prayer meets across the country. The south and western zones of the provinces have already organised the prayer meeting while the east zone will hold its prayer meet soon. The central zone of the Jesuits province consists of Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Hazaribag, Dumka-Raiganj and Madhya Pradesh provinces. The ashes brought in the prayer meeting will be taken to Bagaicha, a workspace of the late activist on the outskirts of the city for a memorial service to be held on July 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/church-bids-farewell-to-stan-memorial-service-on-july-13/articleshow/84304496.cms||Tapas Biswas

Talking to TOI on Saturday, state surveillance officer Dr Rakesh Dayal said, ‚ÄúWe are monitoring the situation on a daily basis and there is nothing to worry about. However, we have advised all our district surveillance officers to ensure that monitoring as well as testing protocols are followed as per the guidelines and if required, fresh guidelines will be issued.‚Äù Asked about their preparation, he said, ‚ÄúWe have completed online as well as offline training of doctors, nursing staff and other health workers on Covid management for kids. Apart from that, PICUs and NICUs are ready in most of the districts and even if cases increase, we will be able to treat the patients in a smooth manner.‚Äù On Friday, a three-year-old boy and a six-year-old girl tested positive in Dhanbad, following which they were admitted to Sahid Nirmal Mahato Medical College and Hospital (SNMMCH). Both the kids are said to be stable and are being treated at SNMMCH‚Äôs PG block. ‚ÄúBoth of them are asymptomatic. We are treating them as per protocol,‚Äù Dr D P Bhushan, in-charge SNMMCH‚Äôs PG block, said. The district administration, meanwhile, has begun contact tracing in Rajganj locality, where the girl hails from. ‚ÄúWe have directed the medical officer of the area concerned to start contact tracing and a medical team, along with IDSP officials, will be doing it,‚Äù Dhanbad SDM Surendra Prasad said. The boy, on the other hand, had arrived with his family in Dhanbad from Telangana. According to the norms, the family was asked to stay in quarantine for seven days after which they had to undergo testing. When their reports came back on Friday, both the father, who is a CISF jawan, and his son tested positive while the mother is negative. The father has been admitted to a separate ward in SNMMCH. In Jamshedpur, the four kids were found infected with MIS-C earlier this week when they were admitted at ESIC hospital in Adityapur area in Seraikela-Kharsawan district. ‚ÄúAll four are stable now and two have already been discharged,‚Äù the superintendent of ESIC hospital, Dr M P Minz, said. Meanwhile, a senior health department official allayed fears that kids who test positive for Covid will be severely infected since they haven‚Äôt been vaccinated. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said, ‚ÄúSeveral sero-survey findings from various parts of the country have indicated that a considerable chunk of kids who haven‚Äôt been vaccinated yet have developed antibodies. This has happened due to their contact with family members who were infected in the past. This is a good sign as it will help in reducing the severity of the infection among kids.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dists-must-entirely-follow-covid-treatment-protocol/articleshow/84304283.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Murmu, the first tribal and female governor of the state, further said there is a necessity for some amendments in the Chhotanagpur Tenancy Act (Act) and the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act (SPT) ‚Äî the two crucial laws for safeguarding the rights and lands of the state Adivasis ‚Äî to reduce conflicts and for the overall progress of the tribal community. Talking to TOI about the TAC at the Raj Bhavan, the outgoing governor said, ‚ÄúAfter the TAC was formed by the government, there were objections raised from different quarters and I had called for the related files. The files reached me late and I was seeking legal and expert opinions on them but my term has come to an end. I have briefed my successor about it.‚Äù Last month, the state government had brought in new rules ‚Äî The Jharkhand Tribes Advisory Council Rules, 2021 ‚Äî and reconstituted the TAC without the governor‚Äôs nod. The TAC is a body that should be set up under the 5th Schedule of the Constitution for states with a high tribal population for their uplift. The schedule also authorised the governor to nominate the members of the council. However, the state government brought the new rules and reconstituted the body after bypassing the governor. The government said its hand was forced after the governor returned the recommendations for the nomination of the TAC members twice in the last one year of its office. Since then, opposition BJP has been accusing chief minister Hemant Soren and his government of bypassing the constitutional head of the state and TAC members of the party boycotted the maiden meeting of the body held in the last week of June. While Murmu, who is also the state‚Äôs first governor to complete her term, didn‚Äôt question the government‚Äôs intention behind the move, she maintained that Article 244 of the Constitution speaks about certain powers of the governor. ‚ÄúIt is the duty of everyone to abide by it,‚Äù she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/wont-question-govt-but-it-must-abide-by-constitution-guv-on-tac-formation/articleshow/84304330.cms||ASRP Mukesh

In March, for the first time, the state had notified the industrial courts as an appellate body under the Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act (POSH), 2013, for those not satisfied with recommendations of internal committees. The HC bench in a July 8 decision, said the relevance of this notification issued in the industrial, energy and labour departments, is the industrial court would be the appellate authority under POSH Act and the woman can avail remedy by filing an appeal before it, against the internal committee (IC) report and order. Under the POSH Act, a complaint is first assessed by an in-house or local mechanism ‚Äî a panel that also has a member from an NGO. The woman approached HC last year with a grievance that since the in-house panel informed her ‚Äúno action was required‚Äù on her complaint alleging sexual harassment, thereby dismissing it, she had nowhere to turn to. Her counsel Mihir Desai said there was no appellate body set up or notified by the state under the POSH Act or rules and hence she was constrained to approach the HC against the company to quash the IC‚Äôs report and order. She also questioned her subsequent ‚Äúillegal termination‚Äù in June 2020. The company opposed her petition and also questioned its maintainability. At a hearing on March 11, the state had said the POSH Act provides for appeals against the IC report. The HC had directed the state to give details of whether such an appellate authority was set up. On July 8, the state informed the HC of its March 31 notification. It made the industrial court in Mumbai the appellate authority in this case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/move-industrial-court-in-sexual-harassment-case-bombay-hc-tells-woman/articleshow/84308540.cms||Swati Deshpande

We will announce a candidate after getting confirmation from the party's central committee. We have appealed to all the members of the party to not to go to the media and claim for ticket.‚Äù Recently, ports minister Michael Lobo had said that his wife Delilah, who is the Parra sarpanch, will stake a claim for a BJP ticket either from Saligao or Siolim. Presently, the Monserrate couple are BJP MLAs, while Atanasio Monserrate represents Panaji and wife, Jennifer, who represents Taleigao, is the state revenue minister. Quepem MLA Chandrakant Kavlekar is also eying a party ticket for his wife Savitri for Sanguem constituency. Savitri had recently fielded candidates for municipal elections.

D‚ÄôSa was among the 10 legislators who had en masse hopped on to the saffron party in July 2019. Things, however, turned sour when D‚ÄôSa‚Äôs supporters didn‚Äôt take kindly to AAP‚Äôs gesture of deriding their MLA in this manner, and confronted the group led by Pratima Coutinho. This led to a fierce verbal duel between the two groups, which also consisted of a sizeable number of women from both sides. Soon, eggs and tomatoes began raining amidst exchange of abuses.

---||India||48 hours after SC grants bail to 13, Agra jail awaits orders via post||AGRA: Over 48 hours after the Supreme Court granted ‚Äúimmediate interim bail‚Äù to 13 convicts lodged at Agra Central Jail who spent between 14 and 20 years each in prison despite being juveniles at the time of committing the crimes, the inmates are yet to walk free. Jail authorities are awaiting court orders that are delivered via India Post. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt release the prisoners on bail until we receive a certified copy of the SC order. We have completed all formalities at our end and will let them go once we get the order,‚Äù V K Singh, senior superintendent of Agra Central Jail, told TOI. The case came to light recently after the convicts moved SC, stating that they were being kept in jail in violation of the Juvenile Justice Act 2000. The maximum sentence for a juvenile is three years. The 13 prisoners had not taken the defence of juvenility due to ignorance during the trial in which they were convicted. In 2012, the Allahabad HC directed the Juvenile Justice Board to determine ages of prisoners, following which the 13 were found to be juvenile offenders. On Thursday, the SC said the 13 should be immediately released on interim bail. Advocate Rishi Malhotra, representing the convicts, said it was ‚Äúshocking‚Äù that despite the court order they were still in prison. ‚ÄúWhen judicial proceedings have moved almost entirely online, these orders are still being sent by post,‚Äù he said. Malhotra said the court registry had informed him that the only mode via which SC orders are sent to the concerned jail is by speed post. ‚ÄúThe post office in the court has said that it will take at least 4-5 days for orders to reach Agra,‚Äù he said. For families, this means a longer wait. Unne Habiba, sister of one of the inmates, said they had given up all hope of seeing him again. ‚ÄúMy brother has been in jail since 2009 when he was 16. I can‚Äôt believe he is coming home,‚Äù she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/48-hours-after-sc-grants-bail-to-13-agra-jail-awaits-orders-via-post/articleshow/84308597.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||India||Unfazed by spinal fractures, ex-Navy man eyes rare feat||PANAJI: Undeterred by the horrific accident in 2018 that left him with two spinal fractures, former naval officer Abhilash Tomy is ready to cast off for another shot at circumnavigating the globe alone. Determined to compete in the 2022 edition of the Golden Globe Race (GGR), a solo non-stop circumnavigation without satellite-based navigation aids, the decorated sailor is looking to crowdfund his race. For some, the relentless desire to sail alone for 60,000km through unforgiving seas and unpredictable nature best describes a daredevil, but for the former naval commander, it is nothing short of a spiritual journey of self-discovery. ‚ÄúI believe that you cannot explore your self if you don‚Äôt cut yourself off from this world. When you are with people, you are always dealing with the external world. Being alone for a prolonged duration kind of alters my mind and I get to know myself,‚Äù Tomy told TOI. Before he gets down to his unfinished business, Tomy has to figure out one part of his puzzle ‚Äî funds. For a good competitive race, he will need around Rs 4 crore, but he knows that this may be a tough ask through crowdfunding. He has also reached out to corporate sponsors. His online campaign has raised Rs 3.5 lakh. ‚ÄúFor me it is very simple, get a boat, do a 2,000-mile training on it, get it ready and I am set,‚Äù said Tomy, who is settled in Goa with his family. This time around, he is not building a boat since it entails a lot of time, money and compliance. Instead, he plans to purchase a pre-owned boat from Europe and refit it. While his earlier 32-foot yacht, the Thuriya, was a twomasted boat, Tomy has now set his eyes on a couple of single-masted 36-footer yachts. Forced out of the race in 2018 after a storm wrecked his yacht and left him injured in one of the remotest parts of the southern Indian Ocean, the Kirti Chakra winner says he has unfinished business with the oceans. A massive multinational rescue mission helped rescue Tomy who now has titanium rods inserted into his spine. The former naval aviator retired from the Navy in January. ‚ÄúI think for anybody to survive through prolonged solitude, where every moment you are worried whether you will survive, you need to have some sort of philosophical strength. In my first circumnavigation, I had to train myself to get back to land,‚Äù said Tomy. ‚ÄúIf a generation of Indians go out to sea, we will be a completely different nation. Sailing nations such as the Netherlands are the best example. You are honest, helpful, you value time, you learn a lot of skills and it gives you patience. And when you come on land, the small problems stop bothering you. Going to sea helps in character development,‚Äù said Tomy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/unfazed-by-spinal-fractures-ex-navy-man-eyes-rare-feat/articleshow/84308609.cms||Newton Sequeira

---||Goa||Goa: ‚ÄòWiping out wild mushroom will trigger a bio disaster‚Äô||PANAJI: Microbiologist and expert on wild mushrooms, Nandakumar Kamat has called on the state forest department to declare Termitomyces heimii as the state wild mushroom of Goa. The species is among the most exploited and there is a need to conserve it, Kamat said. The mushrooms are plucked off termite mounds in forest areas, grasslands, plateaus and hill slopes in Goa and Karnataka. ‚ÄúIf termites get deprived of the fungus, they will starve and die. That would release new viruses from the carrier insects and biotic structure of our forests and grasslands would collapse as mountains of dead plant matter would choke them. If this dry plant matter remains undecomposed, forests would be prone to wildfires and turn into mounds of ashes,‚Äù Kamat said. A single termite hill is ‚Äúnature‚Äôs free, eco-friendly biodegradable solid waste management factory‚Äù converting annually up to 200kg of dead plant biomass and returning precious nutrients to the soil. The scientist said that the rapid erosion of the biodiversity of Goa‚Äôs Termitomyces species from the forest and grassland habitats, which they have occupied for millions of years, is so serious that ‚Äúwe are reaching a critical tipping point wherein this Termitomyces ecosystem could collapse‚Äù. Kamat said that the forest department should collaborate closely with the Goa State Biodiversity Board and the 190 statutory biodiversity management committees, especially those from the mushroom rich Western Ghats region of Goa, and notify the list of wild Termitomyces species, which should not be touched at all. ‚ÄúThis is a 130-million-year-old activity. The most shocking thing is that people don‚Äôt even know or care about the scientific identity of the Termitomyces species they are consuming. Nor has the forest department established the identity of the overexploited Termitomyces species and notified a ban,‚Äù Kamat told TOI. He said that it is due to the diversity of Termitomyces species that crossbreeding of organisms takes place causing evolution of new species. The process, however, has been disturbed in Goa owing to overexploitation of the mushroom, Kamat said. ‚ÄúWe are therefore dismantling a 130 million years of evolutionary process of speciation in a short time. This is catastrophic.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/wiping-out-wild-mushroom-will-trigger-a-bio-disaster/articleshow/84306301.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Nagpur||Nagpur district aims at creating 770 MT oxygen capacity by mid August||NAGPUR: The Nagpur district administration and healthcare officials are taking measures to attain at least minimum self-sufficiency in oxygen before the onset of yet another wave of Covid-19. The district had been through an unprecedented oxygen crisis during the peak of second wave in April-May this year. Following intervention of the high court, especially for ramping up financial resources through the corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds, the district administration today seems to be on a better pitch to ensure hospitals do not run out of oxygen while patients gasp for breath. With the mandate of creating at least three-fold provision than the requirement experienced during the second wave peak, the administration is aiming at creating capacity of 770 metric tonne (MT) oxygen by mid August before another wave strikes. The administration proposes to augment it through addition of 1,027 units comprising pressure swing adsorption (PSA), liquid medical oxygen plants, cylinders and air-separation units (ASUs). Currently, there are 19,164 such units that can cater to demand for around 481 MT oxygen. According to an official, the highest average per day requirement of oxygen in district was 194 MT in April. Apart from outsourcing 80-90 MT from different sites, Inox Air Products Limited produced around 90MT. The remaining requirement was met by around 11 ASUs and re-filling plants in the district. Inox has enhanced its capacity to 100MT following upgrade of its compressor. At least five ASUs are proposed at Koradi thermal power plant, sub-district hospitals at Saoner and Umrer and two other places at Buti Bori. These ASUs would be expected to produce around 44 MT oxygen. At Saoner and Umrer sub-district hospital, private vendor (Abhijit Sapkal Arctic Infratech Solution Private Limited) has been issued work order on June 6 with a deadline to complete of July 31. The work is to be done with around Rs13 crores released from the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF). Construction is under way for three PSA plants at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) of 15.58 MT capacity, Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) of 9.35 MT and All India Institute of Medical sciences (AIIMS) of 0.9 MT capacity. The work order was issued to M/s W2E Engineering Private Limited on May 17 with a deadline to complete the work by July 31. CSR fund of around Rs13.52 crore from WCL is being used for the works. ‚ÄúWe are confident of meeting the deadline,‚Äù said Sanjay Sharma of W2E Engineering Pvt Ltd. Currently, four private hospitals ‚Äî Maa Bhavani, Meditrina, Asha and Seven Star ‚Äî have PSA plants while more are proposed at 10 others. In Government and NMC hospitals, around 2001 jumbo cylinders are available which can store around 18.19 MT oxygen while another 16,400 are available with private facilities having storage capacity of around 149 MT oxygen. Government has proposal to procure another 1,000 jumbo cylinders. District nodal officer for oxygen, Nilesh Kale, said that the PSA plants coming up at government and private facilities would be used at same premises and their self-dependency would reduce requirement from external sources. ‚ÄúWe are certainly aiming to attain the ‚Äòself-sufficient‚Äô label and may be also in position to supply to the rest of the Vidarbha in a better way,‚Äù said Kale and hoped all the proposed and under-construction works are completed within deadline. On the oxygen crisis experienced during the second wave, Anup Marar, convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association, said no one was prepared for such an overwhelming number of positive patients at the same time. ‚ÄúSome of the private hospitals have already commissioned their own oxygen plants,‚Äù said Dr Marar adding that Orange City Hospital is among those setting up own plants. To meet the demand for medical oxygen during the second wave, decisions like stopping 100% industrial use, airlifting tankers by Indian Air Force jumbo planes to bring oxygen from other states, running special trains, procuring cylinders from commercial units and so on were taken. Black-marketing of oxygen concentrators due to their short supply, overpriced oxygen cylinders and refilling had aggravated the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dist-aims-at-creating-770-mt-oxygen-capacity-by-mid-august/articleshow/84304602.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Let us not miss the (Aapli) bus||Congestion, accidents, parking problems and pollution on city roads are a result of a poor public transport system and steady increase in private vehicles every year. Part VI of TOI‚Äôs Smart City series tries to locate the bottlenecksNAGPUR: An efficient and convenient public transport goes a long way in answering the twin problems of pollution and congestion. There is a need to improve the adequacy and adoption of public transport in India, the Niti Aayog says in its transforming mobility report. When any city fails at mobility, the result is congestion, lost productivity, worsening pollution and poor quality of life. This is exactly what Nagpur is witnessing with a poor urban transport system, especially Aapli bus service being run by Nagpur Municipal Corporation. With a population of 25 lakh (as per last Census), only 1.8% people in Nagpur city use public transport (Aapli Bus) and on an average 4,000 use Metro Rail service daily. The NMC‚Äôs transport department has an over 400-bus fleet which it runs via three red and one electric bus operators but has failed to increase ridership. Before ousting Vansh Nimay Infraprojects Limited from the city bus service, the ridership was 1.5 lakh passengers. ‚ÄúDue to Covid-19 restrictions, the transport department is plying 200 buses,‚Äù said a senior official from the NMC‚Äôs transport department. In pre-Covid-19 days, the NMC used to operate 380 buses on over 85 routes. The city‚Äôs vehicular population is almost 20 lakh. With a poor public transport system, every year there is a steady rise in the number of private vehicles. In the last financial year (2020-21), 49,773 new vehicles were added on the city roads. These include 35,654 two-wheelers and 600 autorickshaws. Considering the addition of new autorickshaws, transport expert and HoD VNIT V Landge said, clearly indicates that the city, which is being groomed to transform into a Smart City, requires better public transport. Transport expert and traffic activist Ashok Karandikar said the rapid growth in private vehicles reflects the unsatisfactory public transport system and focus on two-wheeler centric infrastructure. ‚ÄúThe reach of Aapli Bus is not satisfactory, one cannot rely on its frequency and comfort is a distant dream for the commuters,‚Äù said Karandikar. He stressed the local body should not treat city bus service as a profit-making venture and instead treated it as welfare activity. According to Landge, the city‚Äôs transport infrastructure cannot be increased at this juncture. ‚ÄúInstead, the government agencies like NMC should try to improve bus service,‚Äù he said. City planner Ravi Sonkusre is of the view that more vehicles on roads means congestion, accidents, parking problems etc. ‚ÄúDespite having wide roads, new roads and more flyovers, the time to commute has increased on several roads,‚Äù he said. Giving examples, he said new flyovers and roads like Wanjari Nagar, Jail road have decreased travel time but due to poor planning of junctions, bottlenecks remain, thus resulting in increased travel time. ‚ÄúEven traffic volume has increased,‚Äù he said. Nagpur Metro is operational on Sitabuldi-Khapri and Sitabuldi-Lokmanya Nagar (on Hingna road) with all the stations opened to the public. The average daily ridership is about 4,000. Before the second wave of Covid-19, the ridership on weekdays was over 20,000 and 30,000 on Sundays. It has also started six Aapli buses as feeder service and had submitted a plan for 39 buses. ‚ÄúThe rest will start in the coming days as per NMC,‚Äù stated spokesperson from MahaMetro. By December 2021 end, two more stretches (Sitabuldi-Prajapati Nagar and Sitabuldi-Automotive Square) are expected to become operational and Nagpur Metro Phase-I will be complete. MahaMetro has made available 17 e-rickshaws and 22 e-scooters at many stations. E-scooters are available at Neeri, CRPF Colony and Lata Mangeshkar Hospital too. More feeder vehicles will become available in the coming days. In addition, city buses link Metro stations with various parts of the city. PROBLEMS & PLANS * Only 1.8% citizens use public transport (Aapli Bus) and on an average 4,000 take Metro Rail daily * The city‚Äôs vehicular population is almost 20 lakh * 49,773 new vehicles, including 35,654 two-wheelers and 600 autorickshaws, added last financial year * NMC has a fleet of 237 standard, 150 midi, 45 mini and six electric buses * Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the transport department is plying 200 buses * 40 electric buses to be added by March 2022 * Nagpur Metro Phase-II expected to get approval from Union Cabinet soon * When Phase-II is completed, Metro will connect Nagpur to Butibori MIDC, Hingna town, Transport Nagar (Kapsi) and Kanhan (via Kamptee)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/let-us-not-miss-the-aapli-bus/articleshow/84304653.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

In rural RTO, the chief‚Äôs post has been vacant for the last two years and that in the city office has been empty since March this year. Deputy RTO Vinod Jadhav, who is actually chief of east office, has been temporarily made in-charge of the city office, while deputy RTO (Wardha) Bajrang Kharmate has been given the additional charge of RTO rural on Kamptee Road. Besides this, Kharmate also oversees administrative work of his office in Wardha. TOI visited the rural RTO, city RTO and east office, and got a glimpse of the affected work. About 50 to 40 visitors wait for hours every day here wondering whether the officer would turn up or not. Enquiries with department officials revealed that there is no control of seniors over procedural delays in RTOs. Sources said Jadhav has been finding it difficult to oversee work at both city and east offices. In such a scenario, city RTO and deputy RTO (east) cannot function full-fledged and only half-a-day‚Äôs work is being carried out at each of them, said Ganesh Kanarkar of Akhil Bhartiya Manavadhikar Nigrani Samiti. Sources also pointed out that the rural RTO office needs more attention as its jurisdiction also includes Bhandara, Gondia, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts. But there is no full-time RTO. The last full-time RTO Shripad Wadekar took voluntary retirement two years back and the post has been lying vacant since then. Sources pointed out that Kharmate is actually posted as Wardha deputy RTO, which comes under the jurisdiction of Nagpur city RTO. ‚ÄúTaking advantage of this, most employees from all the three offices come late, leading to work getting piled up,‚Äù said Kanarkar. Transporter Kuku Marwah pointed out that the state transport commissioner seems to be least bothered to fill the vacant RTOs posts here, which he claims has affected the smooth functioning of all three offices. Citing an example, Marwah said a transporter‚Äôs truck was detained by the city office for overloading, but there was no senior official to accept the fine amount and the heavy vehicle was stuck there for more than 15 days. Marwah also alleged that corruption in the transport department has increased manifold. Mahesh Pasi (name changed), a visitor at rural RTO, claimed to have been visiting the office for the past four days for an international driving licence. ‚ÄúEvery day I wait for a couple of hours for the concerned officer‚Äôs signature. But my work is still pending,‚Äù he claimed. Despite repeated attempts, transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne was not available for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vacant-posts-badly-hit-work-at-transport-offices/articleshow/84304631.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The results of the DNA sampling would be expedited and are likely to be declared within a month‚Äôs time. According to sources, trained manpower would be a major challenge in operating the DNA facility as the existing strength is left to manage the load of around half a dozen districts. The latest machinery which has been installed and set up would require more manpower as testing of 200 samples can be done at a time now, said a source. Investigations into atrocities against women, especially the ones registered under the protection of children from sexual offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, would now get a boost as the DNA tests in such cases will be completed within a short period. This facility is likely to help prosecution file chargesheet faster under the proposed Disha Act. In another feather in the crown of RFSL, India‚Äôs third wildlife forensic science laboratory has been readied and awaits formal inauguration. After Hyderabad and Dehradun, city‚Äôs RFSL would be the third facility to offer wildlife forensic examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rfsl-dna-lab-1st-in-maha-to-be-upgraded-with-nirbhaya-fund/articleshow/84304730.cms||Soumitra Bose

A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta said such practice must be ‚Äúcondemned in the strongest word‚Äù as it also violates the principle of separation of powers between judiciary and executive. Advising the judges not to resort to such practice, the bench said respect to the court has to be commanded and not demanded and the same is not enhanced by calling public officers. ‚ÄúThe public officers of the executive are also performing their duties as the third limbs of governance. The actions or decisions by the officers are not to benefit them, but as a custodian of public funds and in the interest of administration, some decisions are bound to be taken. It is always open to the high court to set aside the decision which does not meet the test of judicial review but summoning of officers frequently is not appreciable at all. The same is liable to be condemned in the strongest words,‚Äù the bench said. The apex court noted in its judgment that ‚Äúa practice has developed in certain high courts to call officers at the drop of a hat and exert direct or indirect pressure. The line of separation of powers between judiciary and executive is sought to be crossed by summoning the officers and in a way pressuring them to pass an order as per the whims and fancies of the court‚Äù. Referring to its earlier verdict in which the court had advised judges to be humble while exercising the powers granted under the Constitution, the bench said, ‚ÄúThey must have modesty and humility, and not behave like emperors. The legislature, executive and judiciary all have their own broad spheres of operation. It is not proper for any of these three organs of the state to encroach upon the domain of another, otherwise the delicate balance in the Constitution will be upset, and there will be a reaction.‚Äù The court passed the order while adjudicating a service dispute between a medical officer and the UP government by setting aside the HC order directing the state to give 50% back wages to a doctor for a period of 13 years of legal dispute during which he did not discharge his duty as government doctor and did private practice. The court noted that the HC, while hearing the case, had summoned many public officials to appear. ‚ÄúWe feel it is time to reiterate that public officers should not be called to court unnecessarily.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dont-behave-like-emperors-by-summoning-government-officials/articleshow/84308697.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

---||India||1/6th of India‚Äôs ground water reserves over-exploited: Study||NEW DELHI: Nearly one-sixth of India‚Äôs 6,965 groundwater assessment units (block/tehsil/taluka) are ‚Äòover-exploited‚Äô and this along with two other categories of concern ‚Äî ‚Äòcritical‚Äô and ‚Äòsemi-critical‚Äô ‚Äî account for 35% of total assessed units, according to new findings of the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) in a report which may soon be made public. Though depletion of groundwater continues to be a concern in India due to indiscriminate extraction in several states/UT including Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, the latest assessment of ‚Äòdynamic groundwater resources‚Äô in the country shows signs of improvement due to increased recharge and water use efficiency in 2020 compared to 2017. As a result, the numbers of ‚Äòover-exploited‚Äô and ‚Äòcritical‚Äô assessment units have declined while the number of ‚Äòsafe‚Äô units has increased compared to the previous assessment done three years ago. ‚ÄòOver-exploited‚Äô units are those where groundwater extraction substantially exceeds (more than 100%) the annually replenishable groundwater recharge. If it's between 90-100%, it comes under the 'critical' category. Those between 70-90% are categorised as 'semi-critical' while the units where extraction is less than 70% of the annually replenishable groundwater recharge are categorised as 'safe' category. Sharing key points of its findings with the ‚ÄòJal Shakti‚Äô (water resources) ministry, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has recently attributed the improvement in groundwater situation to increase in natural and artificial (rainwater harvesting) recharge and decrease in extraction. Officials in the board noted that the decrease in extraction was mainly due to increased availability of surface water resources due to three consecutive years of normal monsoon rainfall and improved water use efficiency in different sectors. Key points of yet to be released CGWB‚Äôs report, accessed by TOI, show that 1,114 out of 6,965 assessment units in the country are overexploited; 270 are critical; 1,057 are semi-critical; 4,427 are safe and 97 are saline. Though the board had taken a higher number of assessment units for its analysis in 2020 compared to 2017, the findings show a percentage decline in numbers of ‚Äòoverexploited‚Äô and ‚Äòcritical‚Äô units ‚Äî the first two categories of major concerns. According to the report, net availability of extractable ground water resources has increased from around 393 billion cubic meter (BCM) in 2017 to nearly 398 BCM last year whereas extraction for all uses declined from 249 BCM to 245 BCM ‚Äì it means more water remains as a natural reserve. Overall annual recharge was also increased during the period -- from 431.86 BCM in 2017 to 436.15 BCM in 2020. The findings show that the over-exploited areas are mostly concentrated in the north-western part of the country including parts of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh where even though the replenishable resources are abundant, there have been indiscriminate withdrawals of groundwater leading to over-exploitation. The other such areas include parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat, and southern part of peninsular India including parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu. ‚ÄúNorth-western part is the victim of indiscriminate withdrawal of groundwater (mainly for agriculture operations such as cultivation of water-guzzling paddy and sugarcane) whereas parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan fall in arid climatic zone where recharge itself is limited, leading to stress on the resource,‚Äù said an official. Referring to stress in parts of peninsular India, he said, ‚ÄúThe groundwater availability is low in the region mainly due to inherent properties of crystalline aquifers.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/1/6th-of-indias-ground-water-reserves-over-exploited-study/articleshow/84308738.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Goa||Vital to protect khazan lands in coastal plan, say activists||MARGAO: Several prominent environmental activists have expressed their disapproval over the absence of a proper khazan management plan in the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP). In the written submissions over the draft, the activists have sought for a plan to protect and conserve khazan lands, which are core to Goa‚Äôs food security and are highly biodiverse. ‚ÄúThe representation of the khazan system in the draft CZMP is wholly deficient and unacceptable,‚Äù Goa Foundation‚Äôs Claude Alvares said in his submission. ‚ÄúAs for a khazan management plan, none exists. In this respect, the CZMP is a failure.‚Äù He said that khazan structures that provide shelter, food and serve as nesting sites for wildlife are inaccurately marked as mangroves when they are actually traditionally khazan land. ‚ÄúThis diminishes the value of khazans as habitats for these species and reduces the incentive to preserve these lands from an ecological perspective,‚Äù Alvares said in his submission. He said that khazans, which have been flooded due to breaching of bundhs, have not been mentioned in the plan, but are marked as regular khazan lands/mangroves in the CZMP maps. Alvares said that while a certain number of sluice gates have been disclosed in the plan, minor (inner) ones have been left out. As a result, he said, large areas of khazan lands around these inner sluice gates haven‚Äôt been marked. He also made a case for an inquiry into why the water resources department (WRD) hasn‚Äôt mapped certain survey numbers while developing the khazan maps in certain areas. ‚ÄúFor example, survey number 288 in Mandrem is reported to be khazans, but this is not marked in the CZMP. There are other examples of khazan areas left out as well, in Carmona, Cavelossim, Orlim, Candolim and Anjuna,‚Äù he said. Alvares said that the government should take steps to ensure that the khazans be inscribed as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) In their joint written submission, Arturo D‚ÄôSouza, Elsa Fernandes, Gabriella D‚ÄôCruz and Hyacintha Aguiar said that khazan water bodies (poiem) beyond the high tide line (HTL) in every village have to be zoned under eco-sensitive zone CRZ-IA ‚Äúas they are critical to the existence of the other CRZ-IA components of the khazan ecosystem like mangroves, salt marshes, etc‚Äù. ‚ÄúAll khazan water bodies should be clearly indicated with a distinct colour code and listed in eco-sensitive areas, which presently in some cases are completely missing and in some cases, show a lot of ambiguity in their boundaries, extent and colour code across various village maps,‚Äù they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vital-to-protect-khazan-lands-in-coastal-plan-say-activists/articleshow/84305223.cms||---

As per the office of the chief medical officer, the daily vaccination count dropped by 15% on Saturday in comparison to 22,124 inoculations on Friday. At least 18,761 people were jabbed on Saturday at 64 booths ‚Äì 55 government and nine private. Of these, 7,529 (40%) people took the second shot, while 11,232 took the first. With this, the number of fully vaccinated beneficiaries reached over 3.55 lakh, which is nearly 10% of the 35.78 lakh adult population of Lucknow, calculated on the basis of electoral and Aadhar data. Overall, 16.2 lakh doses have been administered so far since the start of the mass immunisation campaign from January 16 this year. ‚ÄúSecond dose beneficiaries will increase in coming days as an increasing number of people who took the first jab in late April and May would be eligible for booster dose soon,‚Äù said district immunisation officer Dr M K Singh. Times View Full vaccination is not the licence to discard masks or ignore social distancing. Vaccinated people can also get infection, although the severity will be low. However, if a person gets infected after vaccination and passes it on to others, the possibility of mutation in the virus increases, which will have serious consequences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/now-lucknows-10-adult-population-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/84308764.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

---||India||Testing tech for Covid virus evolves, result possible in just seconds||MUMBAI: New Covid diagnostic tests, including one that promises a diagnosis within a minute, will be launched next week, pointing to a sea change in detection technologies over the past15 months in the country. While multinational Abbott will launch a new rapid test, Mumbai-based company, MediCircle Health Pvt Ltd, will bring Israeli technology to detect the Covid-19-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus in saliva swab or gargled water within seconds. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology have also transferred their new technology ‚Äî called RT-LAMP ‚Äî that allows an RT-PCR test to be done in three hours as opposed to the regular four to six hours. Dr Nilesh Shah, chief of science and innovation, Metropolis Laboratory, said Covid-19 diagnostics have changed immensely in the past 15 to 16 months. ‚ÄúThe RTPCR test remains the gold standard, but it too has evolved in terms of requirement of time, manpower and incubation period,‚Äù he said. The new RT-PCR tests can deliver results in a matter of five minutes though they carry premium charges of up to Rs 4,500. However, with some countries such as UAE demanding RT-PCR reports that are taken four hours before boarding, such quick RT-PCR have takers. RT-PCR tests, though, due to their huge infrastructure and investment requirements cannot be used for mass testing easily. This is where rapid ‚Äúpoint of care‚Äù tests that can deliver tests in under 15 minutes are useful. Pranav Kolhi of Medi-Circle Health said their new test not only gives results in less than a minute, the results are transferred to the ICMR‚Äôs Covid portal instantly. ‚ÄúThere is no question of a positive test, done using a rapid antigen method or a home-based test, not getting registered,‚Äù he added. This will help trace cases and carry out public health measures to check any spread. A pilot study done in Delhi among 207 samples showed that the test has 93.5% sensitivity. ‚ÄúAs it is a point of care technology, it can be used for mass screening at airport, resorts, offices, malls, etc,‚Äù added Kohli. The Israeli test works on the principle that when infected by the virus, the body produces chemicals that emit a certain wavelength. ‚ÄúWhen a sample from the patient is inserted into our hand-held device, a spectra is generated, giving instant analysis,‚Äù said the press release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/testing-tech-for-virus-evolves-result-possible-in-just-seconds/articleshow/84308775.cms||---

However, experts said there is nothing to get alarmed as Kappa variant is no longer dominant. It is the predecessor of Delta that was declared a variant of concern after it played havoc during the second wave of the pandemic in April and May this year. Kappa variant is less lethal than Delta and Delta Plus but its detection will help authorities in devising future strategy to check its spread and possibilities of mutation. At least 109 samples were sent to the KGMU for genome sequencing in May. Of these, 107 were of Delta and two of Kappa variant. These two cases are of a 13-year-old boy from Kakori and a 14-year-old girl from Mall, highly placed sources in the university confirmed. Both the teens have been tested negative and are said to be fine. Earlier, Kappa variant was found in the sample of a 13-year-old Covid-19 positive girl from Sant Kabir Nagar. Besides, Delta Plus strain has been detected in two patients hailing from Gorakhpur and Deoria, respectively. Officials said Delta Plus needs to be watched carefully.

The accused, who has approached the Punjab and Haryana high court for prearrest bail, also claimed that even in the video, prepared by another female activist, the victim has mentioned only one incident that occurred on the train and involves another accused Anil Malik, who allegedly forcibly kissed her during the journey to Delhi. ‚ÄúExcept this, nothing has been stated against anyone in the said video graphed statement and thereafter she was shifted to other tents with girls and matter was brought to the notice of organisers of the farmers‚Äô protest. If we go through the entire FIR, no offence of rape is made out against anyone and the pointed allegations are only against Anil Malik and that too if taken on the face value, attract only the offence under Section 354 (molestation) under IPC," Anoop has claimed in his plea. Tikri rape case: HC to hear plea tomorrowThe accused approached the HC after a local court in the Jhajjar district of Haryana rejected his anticipatory bail on July 2. His plea would come up for hearing before the HC on Tuesday. The FIR in this case, which includes the charges of gang rape, was registered on May 9 at Bahadurgarh city police station in Haryana‚Äôs Jhajjar district. The complaint in this regard was given by the deceased activist‚Äôs father. As of now, police have arrested the key accused, Anil Malik but two other accused - Ankur Sangwan and Anoop are still at large. Recently, the police also announced rewards for those providing information about the absconding duo. According to police, during interrogation, Anil Malik admitted that the activist was sexually exploited by him along with Anoop. On June 29, the Punjab and Haryana high court had dismissed the anticipatory bail plea of Ankur Sangwan and had observed that while deciding the anticipatory bail of an accused, the impact of grant of anticipatory bail particularly in case of large magnitude affecting a very large number of people is also to be considered.

In the last seven days (till Friday), Covid-related deaths in India fell by 6.9%, which was a significant slowdown in the decline as compared with the 30.7% drop in the previous week and 47.7% dip in the week prior to it. In these seven days, Maharashtra reported 2,681 deaths, a 35.5% rise from the previous seven days. Of these, as many as 1,812 were fatalities that had occurred earlier but were added to the toll during this period. Similarly, Odisha saw a 19.2% jump in fatalities (367 as opposed to 308 in the previous week) and Kerala an 8.4% rise, from 806 in the previous seven days to 874. Sources said both Odisha and Kerala have begun to add older deaths to the daily toll. Unlike in Maharashtra, where the number of older deaths is being acknowledged, the exercise is less transparent in the other two states, the sources said. The daily count of cases in the country stayed above 40,000, with 41,283 fresh cases recorded on Saturday. India had reported 42,718 cases on Friday. There were 578 deaths from the virus, a drop from 670 recorded a day earlier. These counts do not include ‚Äúbacklog‚Äù fatalities reported by Maharashtra.

Over 2.9 crore of Bengal‚Äôs 3.5 crore women voters stepped out to vote, braving the pandemic amid a protracted election schedule. The final turnout of 81.7% does not take into account the large number of postal ballots cast. For men, the corresponding figure is 3 crore of 3.7 crore voters. The high turnout for women is more than Bengal‚Äôs overall turnout of 81.5%, a trend also witnessed in the pre-pandemic 2019 Lok Sabha polls, where also 81.7% women had turned out to vote in Bengal. The win percentage of women candidates, too, was more than that of their male counterparts. Among the 240 women who contested the 2021 assembly polls, 40 (16.7%) won, while 154 of them (64.1%) forfeited their deposits. Among men, 252 candidates won among 1,876 contestants (13.4%), whereas 1,342 of them (71.5%) forfeited deposits. Bengal had an average of seven candidates per assembly constituency. Asokenagar resident Nanibala Debnath, 98, among Bengal‚Äôs oldest women voters, says she cast her vote at home. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even tell my sons whom I voted for,‚Äù she said over the phone, but also said that she was a ‚Äúgreat admirer of Mamata Banerjee.‚Äù ‚ÄúMore women chose to speak though their votes,‚Äù said Sayantani Pal, a first-time voter from Behala who works in a reputable IT firm. Political analyst Biswanath Chakraborty said the Bengal elections ‚Äúwere fought on a gender binary, in which the chief minister had specifically reached out to women in every election rally she addressed. She had also promised health and food schemes targeted at women heads of families, in addition to the direct cash transfer (DCT) to 1.6 crore Bengal households.‚Äù Banerjee had addressed 151 election rallies in a wheelchair; in every rally, she had directly addressed women voters. Joydev Majumdar, director, Jaiprakash Institute of Social Change, attributed this to gender empowerment, which has led to more political awareness among women. ‚ÄúLiteracy has been a key factor. This is surely a healthy index for a robust society. But political parties need to bring more women to decision-making bodies,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúVoting is also an assertion of rights,‚Äù said Ruby Sain, a professor of sociology at Jadavpur University, adding, ‚ÄúWomen, through their votes, wanted to secure their rights. And it is a powerful message. The education level among women is going up, and parents are increasingly playing a key role in encouraging their daughters. Parents, too, are breaking the gender divide at home. But it would have been better if there had been more women candidates in the fray.‚Äù ‚ÄúStanding in the voting queue also sends a powerful message in male-dominated mindsets,‚Äù said psychologist Amit Chakraborty. ‚ÄúThe profile of a woman voter is also changing. Now they are increasingly stepping out to study, work, and thus form opinions. The times of a husband or father telling women whom to vote for are also gone. Democracy has been a great leveller. All discrimination disappears when women cast their votes because each vote has the same value.... With Mamata Banerjee the state‚Äôs first women chief minister, her taking the political fight to male-dominated bastions has had an impact. A huge section of subaltern women identify with how she speaks and conducts herself.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-women-matched-men-in-poll-show-ec-data/articleshow/84306036.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Dilip to call on BJP chief in Delhi amid rumblings of dissent||Kolkata: Increasing squabbles in Bengal BJP often manifesting on social media have made the BJP brass take note of the ‚ÄúBengal cauldron‚Äù, where ‚Äúself-styled‚Äù dissidents keep targeting state unit president Dilip Ghosh and leader of opposition in the assembly Suvendu Adhikari. Ghosh left for Delhi on Saturday to call on BJP president J P Nadda to discuss post-poll ‚Äúorganization issues‚Äù that includes tackling dissent. The latest is the volley of words between Ghosh and former junior Union minister Babul Supriyo over the latter‚Äôs ‚Äúasked to resign‚Äù comment that he later revised in his Facebook post. Ghosh fuelled the debate further in an interview with a private television channel where he said Supriyo will ‚Äúheave a sigh of relief‚Äù after losing the ministry. Supriyo took to social networking site and said he was happy because Ghosh was happy. ‚ÄúAs a state president Dilipda says a lot of things. He said it once again and I listened to what he said. So, if I am willingly trying ‚Äúnot to understand‚Äù what he actually meant, what is the harm? The fact that he is happy with my sigh of relief has made me happy. He is the state president and is respected by all,‚Äù he said. While the former Union minister kept his response at a decent level, BJP‚Äôs Bishnupur MP Soumitra Khan didn‚Äôt. Khan hit out against Adhikari and Ghosh while resigning from the BJP Yuva Morcha state president‚Äôs post though he took back the resignation later. Khan, however, didn‚Äôt take back his comments. Former Bengal minister Rajib Banerjee too has been using social media to take a dig at Adhikari, who chose not to respond. Initially, Bengal BJP chose to ignore comments and actions by Mukul Roy, Banerjee and Khan. Of late, BJP leaders have realized that these are having an impact on the party ranks when the party wanted to consolidate them and carve out its future course. The dissent has started trickling down the ranks in Mahila Morcha and Yuva Morcha, prompting Bengal BJP to serve a show-cause on individual organizers. Such disciplinary steps have fuelled anger at the grassroots since party seniors were going free. BJP national vice-president Mukul Roy joining Trinamool had come as a spot of bother for the party. BJP brass is still silent on Roy while Adhikari has filed a 64-page complaint against the former with the speaker, seeking disqualification of the Krishnanagar Uttar MLA. Ghosh is likely to take up all these issues during his meeting with Nadda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dilip-to-call-on-bjp-chief-in-delhi-amid-rumblings-of-dissent/articleshow/84305634.cms||Rohit Khanna

---||Kolkata||States gain from fuel tax regime: Dilip dig at TMC||Kolkata: The Bengal BJP president took a dig at the ruling Trinamool Congress over their protests against rising fuel prices, saying the state government was a ‚Äúgainer‚Äù in the tax regime as states get a greater share of revenues than the Centre. ‚ÄúOther than VAT and cess on basic fuel prices, states get 42% of the Union excise duty on petrol and diesel. The share percentage is thus bigger than the Centre‚Äôs,‚Äù Dilip Ghosh said. He further said there was no point hitting the streets because fuel prices in India were no longer controlled by governments. ‚ÄúThere is a regulatory committee to decide prices on a daily basis. The new arrangement started way back on June 16, 2017,‚Äù Ghosh said. The purpose of daily revision of prices is to reduce volatility in retail rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/states-gain-from-fuel-tax-regime-dilip-dig-at-tmc/articleshow/84305620.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Housebound Kolkatans reclaim rooftop freedom||KOLKATA: Terraces in homes, neglected for years, are being reclaimed as an integral part of the house during the pandemic, which has forced people indoors. The rediscovery of terraces has led to people investing time, energy and money to do up the space to work, pursue hobbies... or just chill. Nilanjan Chowdhury, a visual artist who works in Delhi but staying in his sister‚Äôs house in Bhowanipore since last year‚Äôs lockdown, has been bringing the faded walls to life with gorgeous paintings of birds, all of which he either spotted on the adjoining jamun tree or at Rabindra Sarobar. ‚ÄúThe idea of painting the rooftop with birds came to me while I was sketching a crow that lives on a big jamun tree next to our home. It had a damaged claw and was initially extremely hostile to my presence on the rooftop. But, over months, it started tolerating me; I think it sometimes models for me,‚Äù Chowdhury recounted. At nearby Lake Terrace, Rajarshi and Sambrita Basu have given a makeover to the terrace of their home. After the couple came down from Bengaluru with their twins, Turjo and Nyja, to be with his mother and sister during the pandemic, they discovered they had to create a play area for the hyperactive kids. ‚ÄúWe laid out artificial turf on the terrace, installed lights and an inflatable pool. They now have a fun space of their own, which doubles as a safe party zone in the evening when friends come over,‚Äù Rajarshi explained. Across the length of the city, on north Kolkata‚Äôs Bhim Ghosh Lane near Hedua Square, government school teacher Biresh Majumder has transformed his terrace into an open-air classroom, where he coaches children in science subjects free of cost. He ensures there is social distance maintained among the kids, including his son Aranyak, a Class VII pupil. ‚ÄúSchooling has been badly affected during the pandemic. I wanted the children to continue with traditional forms of learning, and so choose the terrace. Though coaching has become irregular in the rain, I try to arrange for classes at least once a week,‚Äù he told TOI. Across the river near Nabanna in Howrah‚Äôs Sibpur, retired engineer Utpal Das has converted his sprawling terrace into a mini-farm, where he pursues his latest hobby: growing organic vegetables. An avid travel writer and documentary filmmaker, Das came up with the idea in June last year, when his movement was restricted. ‚ÄúSince I am a vegetarian, I used to shop for vegetables at the local market. But when timings were restricted during the lockdown and it became crowded, I felt uncomfortable. Now I grow leafy vegetables, brinjal, tomato, pointed gourd, ladiesfinger, cauliflower, cabbage, bitter gourd and ridged gourd on the 1,000 sqft terrace,‚Äù he said. Mainak Bhattacharyya, a second-year media science student and passionate photographer, has turned his roof into a studio and clicked more than 2,000 photographs with his camera from the terrace of the three-storied house in Behala‚Äôs Parnasree. He had bought the camera in 2017 to pursue street photography, but after the pandemic changed the way people lead life outside their homes, he decided to explore terrace photography. In the beginning, it was cloudscape and nature. Among his prized shots are a rainbow and lightning, taken last month. ‚ÄúI used to spend time on the terrace with my dad. It was our favourite hangout zone. But after he passed away in 2014, when I was 14, I stopped going there. I returned to studies and had completely lost touch with the terrace until I rediscovered it during the lockdown. It is now my favourite haunt,‚Äù Mainak said. Even apartment-dwellers have realised the importance of balconies. In upcoming projects, architects are going back to the drawing board to carve out larger balconies in flats. ‚ÄúWhat was a place to hang clothes has now become an integral part of the living area,‚Äù said Credai Bengal chairman Nandu Belani. Jadavpur University sociology professor Ruby Sain says terraces have actually helped people rediscover nature, social relationships and freedom. ‚ÄúThe pandemic brought family members together. Confinement within four walls also made people yearn for freedom that the terrace offered,‚Äù she explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/housebound-kolkatans-reclaim-rooftop-freedom/articleshow/84306130.cms||---

He said the party would take up the issue in the coming monsoon session of Parliament. Chowdhury cited the case of Chhattisgarh, where petrol prices have gone down by Rs 12 a litre and diesel by Rs 4 after the state government lowered the VAT on fuel. ‚ÄúSome states have already started a rethink to find a way out. The Centre should also lower the excise duty considering the plight of the common man during the pandemic,‚Äù he said. He urged the Bengal government to cut the VAT rate to reduce the burden on people. The Congress leader also claimed that the Narendra Modi government had mopped up Rs 25 lakh crore from fuel while the rising prices impacted public transport and trade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/adhir-seeks-fuel-price-relief-from-centre-state/articleshow/84305770.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: No processions, virtual ‚Äòpuja‚Äô to mark Jagannath Yatra||LUCKNOW: The annual Lord Jagannath Rath Yatra celebrations will once again be devoid of troupes, tableau trucks, and massive crowds in view of the coronavirus pandemic for the second consecutive year. Temples which used to carry out Jagannath Yatra processions, drawing thousands of devotees pulling the rath (chariots) of the three deities ‚Äì Lord Jagannath, Lord Balbhadra and Devi Subhadra ‚Äì have decided to celebrate the day on July 12 with online live-streaming of rituals without any procession. One of the city‚Äôs oldest puja samiti, Aminabad‚Äôs Shri Mahant Shatrughan Das Rath Yatra Samiti, will not organise its 97th year‚Äôs procession of Jagannath Yatra. ‚ÄúSince the pandemic is not completely over, the committee is in favour of not taking out the yatra for the safety of devotees. No offering of flowers, fruits or prasad will also be allowed, member of the samiti, Surya Prakash Pathak, said. ‚ÄúWe will allow devotees to offer prayers and request them to follow all Covid protocols. We will also live-stream the rituals on our Facebook page (FB/Rathyatra.mahotsav),‚Äù added Pathak. Shri Radha Madhav Sewa Sansthan of Daliganj‚Äôs Madhav Mandir, which will enter its 60th year of Jagannath Yatra, will not host any grand affair. The temple has decided to perform only a set of rituals related to the Rath Yatra inside the temple. ‚ÄúCelebrations used to be a five-day affair when different sets of programmes were organised every day. Given the crisis, live-streaming will be arranged on our Facebook page (radhamadhavlko). While the ritual of taking Lord Jagannath with his siblings on ‚Äò nagar brahman‚Äô (city tour) is an important one, we will do so by taking the deities out in our car and will not stop anywhere,‚Äù said Anurag Sahu, spokesperson of the committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-no-processions-virtual-puja-to-mark-jagannath-yatra/articleshow/84308811.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Chandigarh||Restrictions in Punjab to again kick in if positivity rate crosses 5%||CHANDIGARH: As the Punjab government is in the process of easing restrictions with improving Covid situation, strict lockdown-like curbs will again be clamped if the positivity rate breaches the 5% limit suggested by the World Health Organisation (WHO). With the weekly positivity rate touching as low as 0.52%, most of the restrictions imposed to control the spread during the dreaded second wave of infection have been lifted. Higher the positivity rate, the more difficult it is to control the spread of the virus. To thwart the third wave, the state government has formulated detailed surveillance and containment strategy on recommendations of health experts. Strict measures, including curfews, will be enforced when the positivity rate crosses 10% and the occupancy of oxygen and intensive care unit (ICU) beds goes higher than 30% of total capacity. Weekend and evening lockdowns and restrictions on attendance in offices will come in force in case the positivity rate recorded between 5-10% and bed occupancy between 21-30%. In the case of positivity rate varying between 2-5% and bed occupancy between 15-20%, all educational institutes will be closed while restrictions on gatherings and closure of spaces meant for indoor public activity will be applied. The local administrations will start identifying containments zones once the positivity rate touches 1% and the bed occupancy crosses 15%. For effective containment, it has been decided that an area with two cases will be declared as micro-containment while the threshold for declaring containment zone has been fixed at five or more cases. An area will remain as micro-containment for at least 10 days and a containment zone for at least 14 days. The time period will be extended by seven days if any fresh case surfaces in the span of a week. As testing is considered the most important factor in controlling the spread of the virus by identifying infected people early and isolating them, testing targets have been set. In case of positivity rate goes above 15%, a minimum of 300 tests per lakh population are to be conducted using RT-PCR and rapid antigen test for detecting Covid-19. Minimum of 250 tests per lakh population in case of positivity rate is more than 10%, 200 test per lakh, if positivity rate is recorded between 2-10% and 150 test per lakh if positivity drops below 1%. Punjab principal health secretary Hussan Lal shared that a well-thought strategy had been formulated on the basis of recommendations given by experts roped in by the government. He sounded confident that the government will be able to thwart the third wave. ‚ÄúA detailed action plan has been made and all the necessary arrangements are being made accordingly,‚Äù he said. Lal urged people to help the government in the fight against the pandemic by adopting Covid-appropriate behaviour. Rs 200 core allocated For making necessary arrangements for the third wave, the state government has allocated Rs 205 crore of which Rs 150 crore has been earmarked for drugs and consumables, Rs 30 crore for equipment and Rs 25 crore for oxygen plants. Whole genome sequencing With large samples testing positive for Covid variants of concern, Punjab has identified 10 sentinel sites and sending at least 15 samples per site every 15 days for whole genome sequencing. Positive samples of post-vaccination, re-infection cases, death cases, severe cases, clustering are being sent for sequencing. The government is setting up sequencing facility at GMC Patiala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/restrictions-in-punjab-to-again-kick-in-if-positivity-rate-crosses-5/articleshow/84305377.cms||Vinod Kumar
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Vaccine queue racket prompts extra vigil in Midnapore||MIDNAPORE: The West Midnapore district authorities have prohibited any gathering before 5am near health camps administering vaccines in an attempt to stem manipulation of queues in exchange for cash. While vaccination begins in the morning, beneficiaries worried about a short supply of doses queued up in front of health camps in the small hours until now. An unscrupulous bunch of youths took it upon themselves to ‚Äúenrol‚Äù these beneficiaries. None of these youths is an employee or a designated representative of the state health department. Nevertheless, they jotted down names of people who queued up at night and issued ‚Äútokens‚Äù for vaccination the next day. According to some residents, who inadvertently enrolled themselves for these ‚Äúspecial queues‚Äù, the touts charged up to Rs 600 per jab. The more you could pay, the higher was your name on the vaccination queue list drafted by these youths, they said. The administration came to know about the racket after complaints poured in about Keranitala health camp in Midnapore town. An inquiry was launched. Additional district magistrate (general) Sudip Sarkar said he came across a person who had got his name enrolled by these youths and he informed police. ‚ÄúNow on, cops will ensure that nobody comes near health camps before 5am. They will also ensure that nobody collects money from people with the promise of getting them vaccinated. Those in queue will get the vaccine,‚Äù Sarkar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccine-queue-racket-prompts-extra-vigil-in-midnapore/articleshow/84305888.cms||Sujoy Khanra

However, services related to emergency, Covid-19, post-mortem and medico/vetro-legal will continue as usual. The doctors have been protesting against the state‚Äôs Sixth Pay Commission recommendations surrounding delinking of non-practising allowance (NPA) from the basic pay and reduction in the NPA from 25% to 20%. The Punjab government had started paying NPA from 2011 at the rate of 25% of the basic pay on the pattern of central government with the aim of retaining doctors in government service and to check the exodus of medical professionals from the country. Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu had recently assured the committee to resolve the issue within a week. The joint committee decided that all doctors in the state would boycott the government OPDs and JGDCC would run parallel OPDs in hospital lawns so that the needy are not deprived of health/veterinary services. They also announced that during the boycott of health services, all doctors of the state would donate blood and area-wise blood donation camps would be organised on July 15, 16 and 17.

The action against Joshi came after he gave his reply to a show-cause notice issued by the BJP‚Äôs state unit for his ‚Äúanti-party‚Äù activities. Joshi had been issuing statements against the policies of the Union government and party leadership, which were anti-party activities, said state BJP president Ashwani Sharma. ‚ÄúJoshi did not give up his stubborn attitude, following which the disciplinary committee recommended his expulsion from the primary membership of the party for six years,‚Äù he said. The former Amritsar North MLA, who was in Batala, said Punjab‚Äôs prosperity was due to farmers and as politicians seek votes from every person, including farmers, it was their duty to stand by them when they needed them most. ‚ÄúOver 500 farmers have lost their lives during their ongoing struggle in Delhi and all political parties, even various organisations, have been supporting them. But, we stood against them,‚Äù he said. Joshi said despite his expulsion from the party, his ideology would remain the same and he would continue to work for Punjab and India. Asserting that he always spoke in the party‚Äôs interests, he said did not favour repealing the three farm laws and wanted the government to resolve the issue amicably and through the process of dialogue. They did not understand my point: JoshiThey didn‚Äôt understand my point,‚Äù he claimed. ‚ÄúI have given 35 years to the party... it brought an end to my service with a single stroke of a pen because I stood by farmers,‚Äù he said. Maintaining he knew how to accommodate workers across the state, Joshi said, ‚ÄúAshwani Sharma is junior to me. He contested twice, I did it three times, won twice and became a minister.‚Äù The former MLA had warned that the party would have to pay price for its stubborn attitude in the 2022 assembly elections in Punjab and given a 15-day ultimatum to its own leadership to clear its stand on the farmer‚Äôs issue, which irked the senior leadership. ‚ÄúMaybe this is what Joshi wanted so he could portray himself a ‚Äòmartyr‚Äô in the cause of farmers,‚Äù said sources. Joshi was elected MLA from Amritsar North seat in 2007 and 2012 and was a minister in the Parkash Singh Badal government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/punjab-bjp-expels-mla-anil-joshi-for-anti-party-activities/articleshow/84308733.cms||Yudhvir Rana

The tempered tweets came a day after TOI reported that the Congress leadership was miffed with Sidhu‚Äôs incessant attacks on the state government and Amarinder, and was eager for signs of discipline from the maverick politician who is at daggers drawn with the chief minister. Congress is set to revamp the state unit and the government to set right its political and social messaging ahead of the election campaign. ‚ÄúToday, forces bent-upon Punjab‚Äôs destruction are clearly visible. 1.Delhi govt wants Punjab‚Äôs lifeline, our thermal power plants, to shut down in the middle of Punjab‚Äôs power crisis, leaving Punjabis helpless in this simmering heat and our farmers suffer in this paddysowing season,‚Äù Sishu tweeted. He added, ‚ÄúMeanwhile, Badals-signed PPAs with thermal power plants and Majithia as minister renewable energy (2015-17) signed PPAs for 25 years for solar power at Rs 5.97 to 17.91 per unit to loot Punjab, knowing cost of solar is decreasing 18% per year since 2010 & is Rs 1.99 per unit today.‚Äù Besides omitting Singh from his attacks, his sharp jibe at AAP appeared to reassure some in Congress as it has been widely speculated that Sidhu may join Arvind Kejriwal‚Äôs outfit if his wish in Congress to become the state party chief was not fulfilled. Congress is set to announce the revamp in coming days, with senior leaders saying it will not go beyond the coming week.

The shooter, Bhanu Thakur, shared an ‚ÄòI‚Äôm-goingto-do-this‚Äô video of himself with friends just before the killings, explaining his ‚Äòmotive‚Äô, and even naming the person from whom he bought two countrymade pistols. By the time anyone could react to it, four persons lay dead. The murders took place between 3pm and 3.30pm at Bhawani Nagar area, about 40km from Betul district HQ. Bhanu‚Äôs victims were identified as Barkha Soni, 22, her cousin Bunty, 22, and neighbour Lucky, 18, who was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. Barkha was pursuing her BSc and Bhanu was a truck driver. Bhanu made the video an hour before the incidentIt appears relationship issues led to the incident. Bhanu wanted to marry Barkha ‚Äì they knew each other for a long time -- but their families were not willing. During investigation, we learnt that Barkha was going to marry elsewhere,‚Äù Betul SP Simala Prasad told TOI. Bhanu made the video an hour before the incident and shared it with acquaintances on social media, said the SP. In the video, he says no one else is responsible for what‚Äôs going to happen, and names the man Barkha was engaged to. He got the name of Barkha‚Äôs fianc√© right, say police, adding that they are continuing with their probe.

---||India||After PM Narendra Modi Cabinet rejig, BJP reiterates its message to OBCs||NEW DELHI: Days after a big jump in representation for OBCs in the Union council of ministers, BJP has started amplifying PM Narendra Modi‚Äôs decision as a political message to the community‚Äôs voters who play a decisive role in several states, including UP. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said the Modi dispensation has implemented the vision of BR Ambedkar and Ram Manohar Lohia about inclusive representation and public participation in governance. ‚ÄúThe ministry of PM Modi represents the entire India in true sense. The vision of our icons, especially thinkers like Baba Saheb and Lohia ji, of inclusive representation and public participation has been realised under Modi ji right from governance to society,‚Äù Yogi tweeted. After 36 new faces were inducted on July 7, the Council now has 27 OBC ministers, 12 from Scheduled Castes and eight from Scheduled Tribes. Of the new faces who took oath, seven MPs from UP have been inducted into the Council. The examples Yogi cited are a bid to lay claim to the legacy of the two leaders iconised by Mayawati and Mulayam Singh Yadav. BJP‚Äôs strong performance in UP assembly and Lok Sabha polls has been powered substantially by the accretion of OBCs that helped the party touch the 40% mark. ‚ÄúLohia ji believed that democracy can be mature by empowering the backwards. The PM gave constitutional status to OBC commission and has given responsibility of government by increasing representation of the backward community in central ministry,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúHad Lohia been alive, he would have been pleased to see how his views have been realised.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-pm-narendra-modi-cabinet-rejig-bjp-reiterates-its-message-to-obcs/articleshow/84309103.cms||Akhilesh Singh
---||World||Global tax reform gains steam as G20 FMs back new levies||NEW DELHI: Top finance officials representing most of the world‚Äôs economy have backed a sweeping revision of international taxation that includes a 15% global minimum corporate levy to deter tech giants big companies from resorting to low-rate tax havens. Finance ministers from the Group of 20 countries endorsed the plan at a meeting on Saturday in Venice. Italy hosted the meeting because it holds the rotating chair of the G-20, which makes up over 80% of the world economy. US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said the proposal will end a ‚Äúself-defeating international tax competition‚Äù in which countries have for years lowered their rates to attract companies. She said that had been ‚Äúa race that nobody has won. What it has done instead is to deprive us of resources we need to invest in our people, workforces, infrastructure.‚Äù The next steps include more work on key details at the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and then a final decision at the G20 meeting of presidents and prime ministers on October 30-31 in Rome. If enacted, the plan could reshape the global economy, but resistance is mounting from businesses, which could soon face higher tax bills, as well as from small, but pivotal, low-tax countries such as Ireland, which would see their economic models turned upside down. Implementation, expected as early as 2023, would also depend on action at the national level. Countries would enact the minimum tax requirement into their own laws. Other parts could require a formal treaty. The draft proposal was approved on July 1 in talks among more than 130 countries convened by the OECD. The international tax proposal aims to deter the world‚Äôs biggest firms from using accounting and legal schemes to shift their profits to countries where little or no tax is due ‚Äî and where the company may do little or no actual business. Under the minimum, companies that escape taxes abroad would pay them at home. That would eliminate incentives for using tax havens or for setting them up. From 2000-2018, US companies booked half of all foreign profits in seven low-tax jurisdictions: Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Singapore and Switzerland. A second part of the tax plan is to permit countries to tax a portion of the profits of companies that earn profits without a physical presence, such as through online retailing or digital advertising. That part arose after France, followed by other countries, imposed a digital service tax on US tech giants such as Amazon and Google. The US government regards those national taxes as unfair trade practices and is holding out the threat of retaliation against those countries‚Äô imports into the US through higher import taxes. Under the tax deal, those countries would have to drop or refrain from national taxes in favour of a single global approach, in theory ending the trade disputes with the US. US tech companies would then face only the one tax regime, instead of a multitude of different national digital taxes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/global-tax-reform-gains-steam-as-g20-fms-back-new-levies/articleshow/84309163.cms||---

Fresh cases in Tamil Nadu dropped below 3,000 after 100 days (since April 1). At least 3,321 people were discharged from the registry when the state reported 49 deaths on Saturday, pushing the case tally to 25.16 lakh and death toll to 33,371. ‚ÄúThis is the time we have to be cautious. The positivity rate is steadily dropping but so is adherence to pandemic protocols,‚Äù said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. ‚ÄúWe have directed all districts to draw samples from people with symptoms and pick random samples in workplaces and crowded areas,‚Äù he said. The state, which was reporting an average of more than 14,000 cases until mid-June, is now reporting fewer than 3,000 cases every day, but with increase in risk behaviour, the rate at which cases fall has slowed down. ‚ÄúPeople violate mask and social distancing norms in closed spaces such as restaurants and shopping complexes, sit close to each other even in public transport. It can increase risk of clusters,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe only way to reinforce proper public behaviour, besides fining them, will be constant reminders,‚Äù he said. On Saturday, western districts Coimbatore, Erode and Salem recorded 338, 215 and 180 cases. On Friday, Coimbatore reported 349 new cases, Erode 230 and Salem 191. The districts also have most active cases ‚Äî Coimbatore 4,108, Erode 2,997 and Salem 2,155. While Chennai and Thanjavur reported 174 new cases each, Trichy reported 116 cases and Madurai reported 39. New cases in 30 districts were in double digits, at least 19 districts had new cases below 50. Ramanathapuram reported six cases, the least, followed by Perambalur (16) and Tenkasi (17). Dindigul which recorded 18 cases on Friday, logged 23 new cases on Saturday. Of the 49 deaths, Cuddalore reported seven, Tirupur six, Salem and Chennai reported four each. Sixteen districts reported zero deaths and10 of them reported one each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/fresh-covid-cases-in-tamil-nadu-below-3000-after-100-days/articleshow/84309193.cms||---

By 10pm, TN received 5 lakh doses of Covishield, which were dispatched to districts by road late in the night. Officials said districts will resume vaccination from Sunday but those requiring Covaxin ‚Äì first or second dose ‚Äì will have to wait until Tuesday, when the next stock of the vaccine is expected. The state, which had around 20,000 doses, recorded 27,922 vaccinations on Saturday. Officials said the daily count includes several backlog entries. ‚ÄúSome primary health centres (PHCs) and hospitals do not enter the details of recipients every day. Some of these backlog entries get added to the daily list. Also, nurses manage to squeeze out up to at least 11 doses from every 10-dose vial,‚Äù said joint director immunisation Dr K Vinay Kumar. Over the past week, the state has reported a maximum of 1.3 lakh vaccinations in a day compared to 4.7 lakh on July 3. Coimbatore, which reported nil doses, had no vaccination camps for the seventh day in a row. While most districts in the western belt complained of the same problem, the situation wasn‚Äôt different in the southern districts. In Madurai, around 1,000 people were vaccinated on Saturday. Most people who received shots got it through special camps organised by the district health authorities, but what has irked senior citizens is the lack of information. ‚ÄúI am trying to get information on the availability of vaccines. I have called helplines and have asked people I know. Most say there is no vaccine. My husband and I were due for the second dose on July 5,‚Äù said A Sundari a resident of Tahsildar Nagar. To make things worse, she got a text message reminding her to get the second dose on time. In the midst of acute vaccine shortage, state commercial taxes minister P Moorthy inaugurated a special vaccination camp organised by the state labour welfare department. He told reporters that 4,000 construction workers have received their first dose and that steps were on to vaccinate autorickshaw drivers and industrial workers. ‚ÄúWe are vaccinating as many people as possible every day. The number of vaccinations depend on the number of vaccines received,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/18-tamil-nadu-districts-had-nil-vaccine-stock-on-saturday/articleshow/84309226.cms||---

The former CM had become the ‚ÄòRaja‚Äô at the age of 13 years. Vikramaditya has become 124th ruler of the erstwhile princely state. After a gap of 74 years, the symbolic coronation ceremony took place at the Padam Palace amid pal of gloom as the body of Virbhadra Singh was kept at the Darbar Hall. The Bushahar royal family tradition demanded that the coronation takes place before the cremation of a raja. The folklore is that Bushahar was founded by Pradhuman, the son of Lord Krishna. According to sources, Vikramaditya was reluctant about coronation ceremony but the family members persuaded him to follow the custom after which closed door simple ceremony took place in a room adjoining the Darbar Hall of Padam Palace in the morning. The ceremony started at 8am and was completed with hawan at 11am. Virbhadra had become raja at the age of 13 years following the demise of his father Sir Padam Singh in 1947. For last 74 years, he held the title, while his son Vikramaditya (31) was being referred to as ‚ÄúTikka‚Äù. Vikramaditya is the political heir too. In the 2017 assembly election, Virbhadra had left his Shimla Rural seat for his son and had shifted to Arki assembly constituency. This gave Vikramaditya to become the youngest MLA in Himachal Pradesh assembly, while his father was the oldest MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/vikramaditya-coroneted-king-of-erstwhile-bushahar-princely-state/articleshow/84305531.cms||---

The interview, scheduled for July 19, will not be held till further orders, the HC said, directing the TNPSC to make available all certificates and credentials of shortlisted candidates to petitioners who had moved the court. ‚ÄúSince this court is convinced that there are defects in the process of recruitment, this court is of the view that the petitioners‚Äô right should be preserved during the pendency of the writ petitions. Hence there shall be an order for maintaining status quo,‚Äù said Justice S S Sundar in his interim orders. It is seen that TNPSC has now issued notification dated July 1 asking selected candidates to attend the interview on July 19. Hence the interview as scheduled by the notification shall be postponed sine die. There shall be no interview during pendency of the writ petitions or until further orders, the court added. Directing the registry to post the pleas on July 19 for final hearing, the judge said: ‚ÄúThis court will consider whether or not TNPSC can be directed to publish marks obtained by all candidates in the written examination and as to the publication of certificates of all the selected candidates.‚Äù The credentials of the institutions which have issued such certificates will also be considered on July 19, the court added. The court passed the order on a batch of pleas moved by candidates challenging the recruitment process. According to the petitioners, of the 226 candidates selected for the interview, many are not eligible as per the recruitment notification. They further demonstrated before the court that some candidates who were selected earlier by holding that they have required qualification were not selected and that there is no material to reconcile the inconsistencies. Recording the submissions, Justice Sundar said: ‚ÄúIn such circumstances, this court is of the prima facie view that all certificates and credentials of the selected candidates should be made available to the counsels appearing for the petitioners in all the writ petitions.‚Äù Noting that such a move alone would ensure transparency in the process of selection, he said, ‚ÄúThis court also can get a valid assistance while considering the cases on merits.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/faulty-tnpsc-selection-process-madras-hc-stays-mv-inspector-interviews/articleshow/84309257.cms||Suresh Kumar

Police said the two were travelling towards Sohna from Badshahpur in an Eeco when they lost control of the car and it hit the pole. The vehicle veered off the road and within seconds, flames had engulfed the car. The two occupants got trapped inside and were burnt alive, passersby said.  By the time police and fire services personnel reached the spot, the two were already dead. The identities of the deceased are yet to be established. The car had a Rajasthan registration number. ‚ÄúA fire tender reached the spot, but the occupants could not be saved. The exact cause of the fire will be known only after an investigation,‚Äù said police spokesperson Subhash Boken. However, sources said the vehicle was fitted with a CNG cylinder and a gas leak could have caused the flames. According to IS Khayap, a retired fire officer, the gates of a car usually get locked automatically in case of a fire due to the electronic lock system. ‚ÄúBut in vehicles with manual locks, the chances of getting trapped inside are less. In this case, the victims probably failed to come out of the car due to their injuries.‚Äù On May 1, a 16-year-old boy was charred to death inside his car in the Jatauli area.

These are some of the findings in the 2019-20 report of the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE+). Though the survey was conducted before the pandemic, experts believe that it, more or less, reflects the current status of government schools. In contrast, 62.4 per cent of private unaided schools have internet and 68.4 per cent have working computer labs. MS Thimmappa, a noted academic and former vicechancellor of the Bangalore University, said that the government must look into this digital divide seriously. ‚ÄúThe government has funds; implementation is the only challenge. Our policymakers must look into these kinds of challenges. Schools lack an internet connection because of corruption or ignorance. We need to rectify this,‚Äù he said. He added that lack of facilities put students of government schools at a disadvantage compared to private school pupils. According to the UDISE+ report, only 3,862 out of 49,834 government schools have internet access. Of the 20,069 private unaided schools, 12,530 have this facility. There are 7,244 government-aided private schools in the state, and 2,623 of these have net connections. The report states that 17,130 government, 4,882 aided private and 13,739 private unaided schools have functional computer labs. In Chamarajanagar district, which has a sizeable tribal population, only five government and 36 private unaided schools have a net connection. In Kodagu and Shivamogga districts, nine and 86 government schools have access, respectively. Chandrashekar Nuggi, the general secretary of the Government Teachers‚Äô Association, said that most students enrolled in government schools were from economically weaker and socially backward classes. ‚ÄúWe are aware of the situation (lack of facilities). That is why we are opposing internet-based learning systems,‚Äù he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/karnataka-only-34-of-govt-schools-have-working-computer-lab/articleshow/84309311.cms||Shrinivasa M

The insurgents had been encroaching on Kandahar, the capital of the province of the same name, for several weeks, capturing surrounding districts, before entering the city for the first time on Friday. Taliban fighters entered Kandahar‚Äôs Seventh police district on Friday, seizing houses and engaging with security forces in the area, said Bahir Ahmadi, spokesperson for the Kandahar governor. Commandos and other special forces units were battling the insurgents well into the evening, proceeding cautiously because the area is heavily populated, Ahmadi said. The Afghan air force struck a number of Taliban positions in neighbouring districts, as the insurgents attempted to push way into the city. The attack comes less than 24 hours after President Biden defended his decision to end US involvement in Afghanistan. The Afghan were also preparing to try to retake border crossings seized by the Taliban. A spokesman for Herat province said the authorities were deploying fresh troops to retake the Islam Qala post, the biggest trade crossing between Iran and Afghanistan. Afghan security forces have struggled to defend themselves against the Taliban, who in the span of just over two months have managed to seize at least 150 of Afghanistan‚Äôs roughly 400 districts. Kandahar city, the main one in Afghanistan‚Äôs ethnic Pashtun heartland, was the birthplace of the Taliban during the country‚Äôs civil war in 1990s.

Though Aarti, whose parents are daily-wagers from Madhya Pradesh, secured 10 CGPA in the recently announced matriculation result of the Board of School Education Haryana, she is not happy. ‚ÄúI worked hard, so I could get a 2nd or 3rd rank in the state, but exams were not conducted,‚Äù she said. To express her anguish, Aarti wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the last week of May, expressing her desire to sit for the exams. She said she was hoping to be in the merit list, so she could get a scholarship as per Haryana school board norms and that amount would have aided in her dream of becoming a professor. Aarti says her parents, father Govind Pal and mother Prabha Devi, are construction workers and, to aid their income, they work as guards in under-construction houses. ‚ÄúSince they are out for work during the day, I work as a guard in their place and keep an eye on cement bags, electric water motor and valuable electricity material,‚Äù she says. She says her parents could not make it big in their lives, but they understood the importance of education. In the search of greener pastures, they moved to Rohtak. ‚ÄúThough we don‚Äôt have resources to study in elite English-medium schools, I am burning the midnight oil with my head dug in books, so that I could compete with other students,‚Äù she adds. On her ordeal during the pandemic, she says she is a student of a government school in Rohtak, but she had to struggle for a smartphone and expensive data package after online classes started. She also thanked the local evening school for migrant children, ‚ÄòGandhi School‚Äô, for helping her cover the syllabus when she could not afford tuition and tutors to continue her education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/guard-by-day-student-by-night-16-yr-old-girl-with-10-cgpa-aspires-to-be-a-professor/articleshow/84305916.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Dr P K Warrier, healer & humanist, passes away||KOZHIKODE: Eminent Ayurveda physician and managing trustee of Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala (AVS), Dr P K Warrier, who played a monumental role in popularizing Ayurveda across the world and in building a bridge between traditional Indian systems of healing and modern medicine passed away on Saturday, a month after celebrating his 100th birthday on June 8. The demise of Warrier, who was honoured by the country with Padma Shri in1999 and Padma Bhushan in 2010, marks the departure of a colossus who provided a healing touch to the lives of many generations, one that transcended class, community and creed. According to AVS officials, Warrier breathed his last at the Ayurvedic hospital and research centre of AVS at Kottakkal situated near his Kailasa Mandiram residence at around Saturday noon. Warrier's centenary birthday celebrations ‚ÄòSatapoornima‚Äô was held online in June to comply with Covid-19 guidelines. Warrier himself had tested Covid positive last month but was discharged on June17 after recovery. President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with a host of other leaders, condoled Warrier's death. Modi said that Warrier's contributions to popularise Ayurveda will always be remembered. A visionary institution builder, Dr Warrier had during his decades-long Ayurvedic practice given solace and care to countless patients, including VVIPs comprising a number of presidents and prime ministers from India and abroad apart from business leaders, royalty and celebrities from across the world. Made contributions to modernize AyurvedaWith equal care and concern, he treated a legion of ordinary people who came to the charitable hospital of AVS for free treatment and medicines. He led the Arya Vaidya Sala for over six decades, turning the 116 year-old charitable trust into a synonym for excellence in Ayurveda and at the same time contributing to modernize the clinical, pharmaceutical, educational and research domains of Ayurveda. Born to Kodi Thalappana Sreedharan Namboodiri and Kunji Varassiar on June 5, 1921 at Kottakkal, he had his schooling at Kottakkal Rajas High School and Zamorin's High School in Kozhikode and went on to study Ayurveda at the Aryavaidya Patalasa (currently Vaidyaratnam P S Varier Ayurveda College). During his student days he got attracted to the national movement and participated in the Quit India movement. He grew close to the Communist movement and even took a break from studies for two years but later quit active politics to become part of the illustrious Ayruvedic tradition of the family. He became a trustee of Arya Vaidya Sala, founded by his uncle P S Varrier in 1902, at a young age of 24 and started his career as factory manager of the medicine manufacturing plant of AVS in 1947. He took over the reins of AVS as managing trustee in 1954 following the demise of his elder brother P M Varier in an air crash. He made seminal contributions in the revival and mass adoption of Ayurveda by upholding the scientific basis of classical authentic Ayurveda treatment. AVS, which had an annual turnover of Rs 9 lakh when he took over has grown to have a current turnover of Rs 400 crore. An avid learner, Warrier was keenly interested in research and development and under his leadership AVS had taken up collaborative research programmes with CSIR for identifying bio active molecules and also for improving manufacturing processes. P K Warrier is survived by son Dr K Balachandra Varier and daughter Subadra Ramachandran. His wife Madhavikutty K Varier, a poet, had died in 1997 and his son Vijayan Varier had passed away in 2013. Dr Warrier‚Äôs mortal remains were kept at Kailasa Mandiram for the public to pay homage. His last rites were held at the family's funeral grounds at Nayadippara with state honours in the evening. Ministers V Abdurahiman and A K Saseendran represented the state government in the funeral which was attended by leaders of various political parties and people from all walks of life. Warrier personally oversaw the cancer related studies being conducted at AVS and unique package of formulations were evolved for treatment. He also set up the Centre of Medicinal Plants Research at Kottakkal for the conservation of medicinal plants and to undertake research in the areas of phytochemistry, taxonomy, pharmacognosy. Warrier also initiated research activities in the fields of drug standardization, drug development and process improvement. At his instance, AVS has also collaborated with major research agencies like CSIR, DST, AYUSH and IIT in joint programmes on rasayana, herbo-metal formulations, bioactive molecules, etc. Warrier has coauthored the five volume treatise Indian Medicinal Plants ‚Äì A Compendium of 500 Species, which is testimony to his dedication to scientific research and documentation in Ayurveda. Dr Warrier always took care to ensure that his institution remained firmly rooted in its charitable nature with the major chunk of AVS's income going for the charitable hospital which provides free treatment for around 1,500 outpatient patients every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/dr-p-k-warrier-healer-humanist-passes-away/articleshow/84309359.cms||K R Rajeev
---||Thiruvananthapuram||It‚Äôs not practical to extend lockdown indefinitely, says Kerala CM||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said it is not practical to continue the lockdown indefinitely. Hence the situation has to be brought under control for which the people should not misuse relaxations. Presently, the situation is not encouraging in the state, he said. The government is bringing in relaxations in a phased manner since it is not favouring indefinite lockdown. However, it has been widely noticed that people are misusing relaxations. While the second wave has subsided in all other states, we are still witnessing a TPR above 10%, he said. ‚ÄúBut it is not a cause of worry. We can bring down the cases if we all together strive for it. The state is still witnessing cases since the second wave has hit Kerala last in the country. At one stage, the TPR had touched 29% in the state. However, for the past few days, the TPR is near 10%,‚Äù said the chief minister. The state has to bring down the TPR further. On average, the state is witnessing a caseload of 10,000 to 14,000 per day. Along with the increase in Covid cases, there is also a corresponding increase in deaths. It has to be noted that the Delta variant had been found in the state during the second wave and it has the peculiarity of rapid spreading. This is the reason for the increasing number of cases. Since the population density is high here, it was also one of the reasons for the rapid spread. Due to the Delta variant, even those vaccinated have been infected. In some instances, reinfection has also been reported here. However, the state never witnessed massive casualties, which was due to the effective preventive and treatment mechanisms, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/its-not-practical-to-extend-lockdown-indefinitely-says-kerala-cm/articleshow/84309240.cms||---

The pandemic has accelerated the trend of getting almost everything delivered at home. Companies like Zomato, Swiggy, Dunzo, Telyport, Rapido, Porter, Lynk, Pindrop, Amazon, Flipkart, Grofers, Jiomart, Licious and BigBasket employ thousands of delivery personnel in the city. Many people who lost jobs or faced salary cuts in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis are also taking up delivery gigs. Those unable to buy new two-wheelers are renting scooters and bikes for the job. According to Vogo, a twowheeler rental startup, delivery executives and frontline workers accounted for only 8 per cent of the total demand in September 2020. This increased to 54 per cent in April this year as the second wave of Covid-19 gripped the city. ‚ÄúOf the 54 per cent, delivery persons accounted for 46 per cent of the usage. Personal usage, which is the largest contributor to demand in normal times, accounted for just 20 per cent of usage during the same period (April 2021),‚Äù said a Vogo spokesperson. Many Vogo customers rented scooters for a minimum of two to three days, using the vehicle repeatedly or keeping one for an emergency. Vivekananda Hallekere, CEO and co-founder of Bounce, a two-wheeler rental startup, said that the delivery industry was one such segment that had witnessed a positive change because of the nature of the pandemic. ‚ÄúThere has been a massive demand for home delivery of groceries, food and other products,‚Äù he added. Amit Gupta, founder and CEO of electric scooter rental firm Yulu Bikes, said that more delivery executives were using its services than before. ‚ÄúThey comprised 3 to 4 per cent of daily active users in September 2020, a figure that increased to around 12 per cent in June 2021. We launched long-term rental plans, including benefits such as unlimited battery swaps, to provide more value to customers,‚Äù he said. According to Vinay Sarathy, the president of the United Food Delivery Partners‚Äô Union, many workers first buy a smartphone and then rent a scooter as it is affordable. ‚ÄúEveryone cannot afford to buy a new scooter. Several people are delivering food on cycles,‚Äù he said. Displacement of workers from cities following the pandemic has created the need for more personnel. ‚ÄúWe worked closely with some NGOs to enable marginalised communities and women to access Bounce bikes at a low cost and learn how to ride a two-wheeler,‚Äù Hallekere said. ‚ÄúWe have also been working with prominent hyperlocal delivery companies to support their delivery personnel.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-delivery-gigs-driving-demand-for-rental-bikes/articleshow/84309371.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

The EU ‚Äî lambasted earlier for a botched vaccine acquisition programme ‚Äî said on Saturday it has delivered enough shots to cover 70% of the bloc‚Äôs population. After an ‚Äúexponential‚Äù rise in cases in recent days, officials in the Spanish region of Catalonia said they had no choice but to reimpose restrictions. Also set to reimpose curbs on Saturday is the Netherlands, where infections rose sevenfold in one week, a surge officials have blamed on the Delta variant. Britain on Friday said there had been 54,268 new cases of the Delta variant in the week to July 7, a rise on the 50,824 new cases reported the previous week. The total number of cases of the variant reported was 216,249, a 32% increase from last week. Public Health England said its weekly analysis shows the continued rise in infections is not followed by a similar increase in hospitalisations and deaths, which reflects a high protection offered by both doses of a vaccine. CNN reported on Saturday that the US has surpassed 20,000 new cases for the fourth day in a row as the Delta variant continued to be the most common variant in the US. Supply shortages in South Korea have meant only about 11% of the country‚Äôs 52 million population is fully vaccinated, authorities said. The nation reported 1,378 new cases on Saturday, a third straight record high. From Monday, gatherings of over two people will be banned after 6:00pm, schools, bars and clubs will be closed. Deaths in Russia have hit another daily record, with officials reporting 752 more fatalities. The taskforce on Saturday reported 25,082 new cases. Officials have attributed a rise in cases and mortality to the spread of the Delta variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/delta-puts-brakes-on-return-to-post-covid-normalcy-globally/articleshow/84309450.cms||---

Haiti‚Äôs remarkable request for military assistance from the US, a former colonial overlord that has repeatedly intervened in the nation‚Äôs affairs, is a measure of how deeply shaken the nation has been by days of chaos and intrigue. But the Biden administration has so far given no indication it will provide military assistance. For now, it only plans to send FBI officials to help in probe. On the streets, vigilantes prowled for suspects, and police killed at least three people in gunfights. The vast majority of those arrested have turned out to be from Colombia ‚Äî former military men said to have turned mercenaries. And in a brewing political crisis, suspicion has prompted what may shape up to be a standoff between rival governments. On Friday, a group of lawmakers announced they had recognised Joseph Lambert, the head of Haiti‚Äôs dismantled senate, as provisional president in a challenge to the interim government‚Äôs authority. They also recognised as PM Ariel Henry, whom Moise had selected to replace Joseph a day before he was killed but who had not yet taken office or formed a government. One of those lawmakers, Rosemond Pradel said Joseph ‚Äúis neither qualified nor has the legal right‚Äù to lead Haiti. Joseph expressed dismay that others would try to take advantage of Moise‚Äôs death for political gain. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested in a power struggle,‚Äù said Joseph, who assumed leadership with the backing of the military. Meanwhile, more details emerged about the crime. Of the 20 people detained by police, 18 were identified as Colombians, and two as Americans of Haitian descent, with five more suspects said to be on the loose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/haiti-seeks-us-troops-after-wild-day-of-gunfights-and-suspicion/articleshow/84309532.cms||---

In 2018, state transport department incorporated a new category ‚Äî asking applicants if they are an organ donor ‚Äî in online applications for driving licence renewal as well as for issuance of fresh ones. The applicants, however, would choose the ‚Äòskip‚Äô option due to which it was replaced with ‚Äòresponse‚Äô in yes or no, in August last year. Transport department commissioner Mahendra Soni said, ‚ÄúRajasthan was the first state which had the organ donation provision for learners‚Äô licence as well. When an applicant fills the online form for driving licence, they have to choose ‚Äòyes‚Äô or ‚Äòno‚Äô for organ donation without which the application will not be submitted in the software. In 10 months, the persons agreeing to organ donation has increased from 3% to 30%. Awareness campaigns regarding the same will be also done in the coming days.‚Äù According to the department, a total of 1,90,398 persons who applied for driving licence have give their consent for organ donation. The desert state was also the first to issue driving licence bearing the ‚Äòorgan donor‚Äô logo. Officials claimed that this initiative makes it simpler for authorities in case of an accident or if the individual is declared brain dead to retrieve his/her organs and donated to patients requiring a transplant. For those who have licences issued prior to this feature can also become organ donors when they go for renewal of licences or for updation of details on the document. Every year, the department issues about 10-11 lakh driving licences, while Rajasthan witnesses about 5% of the total accidents that happen in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajasthan-nearly-2l-applicants-for-driving-licence-agree-to-organ-donation/articleshow/84309574.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

It is a rationale that has echoes of the legal justification used by the US when they cross inside another country‚Äôs borders to rout terrorist groups. ‚ÄúI made it clear to him that we expect them to act if we give them enough information to act on who that is,‚Äù Biden told reporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/stop-ransomware-hackers-or-us-will-strike-back-joe-biden-warns-putin/articleshow/84309588.cms||---

But members of Gen Z do seem to agree with their elders on one thing: Email. Ugh. And, if we‚Äôre lucky, maybe they can one day save everyone from overflowing inboxes. According to a 2020 study from the consulting firm Creative Strategies, there‚Äôs a generational gap in primary work tools. The survey found for those 30 and above, email was among the top tools they used for collaboration. For those under 30, Google Docs was the app workers associated most with collaboration, followed by Zoom. Adam Simmons, 24, prefers to communicate using ‚Äúliterally anything but email‚Äù. He owns a video production company and he primarily communicates with his eight staffers and clients over text, Instagram and Zoom. ‚ÄúEmail is all your stressors in one area, which makes burnout so much harder,‚Äù he said. The turning point for him was when a work email got lost in the spam folder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually crazy how outdated it is,‚Äù he said of email. Some people wrote about feeling guilty for not being able to reply faster or for adding emails to their colleagues‚Äô inboxes. Others described how responding to a barrage of emails caused them to lose track of other tasks. Some have been trying to get rid of email for years. Writers like Cal Newport, whose book ‚ÄúA World Without Email: Reimagining Work in an Age of Communication Overload‚Äù was published in March, has long argued that the ‚Äútyranny of the inbox‚Äù causes us to lose our ability to concentrate. In 2017, a study found that the average inbox had 199 unread emails. ‚ÄúWe feel frustrated. We feel tired. We feel anxious. Because the human brain can‚Äôt do it,‚Äù he said in March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/gen-z-wants-to-free-the-world-from-outdated-email/articleshow/84309623.cms||---

The state‚Äôs projected population, based on the 2011 Census, is 2.92 crore. The vaccine coverage has been calculated based on the projected population of each district estimated by the state government. Gurgaon, where the pace of vaccinations was hit hard because of shortage of doses in the first two weeks of June, has seen the biggest improvement among Haryana districts since June 21, when the Centre took control of vaccine distribution again. According to the government‚Äôs estimate, the projected population to be covered in the city is 17.46 lakh. Till July 9, 15.14 lakh doses were administered. Not all who have taken vaccines in Gurgaon would be residents of the city, though. So far, 12.49 lakh people have received their first doses in the city. The health department hopes to provide at least one dose to the entire population in the next one and a half months. ‚ÄúWe are aiming to give at least the first dose to everyone. We have already been working on a plan to increase our reach in rural areas and vaccinate those due for their second doses. We are setting up dedicated second dose sites to avoid overcrowding,‚Äù said Dr Virender Yadav, Gurgaon‚Äôs chief medical officer. While Panchkula has also given 51.7% of its population at least one dose, with a projected population of just 6.44 lakh ‚Äî almost one-third of that of Gurgaon ‚Äî it could have done more. A Panchkula health official said the pace of vaccinations has been slow as a majority of the population comprises migrants. Ambala, which has a projected population of 13.1 lakh, has managed to cover 50.7% of its population in the Covid vaccination drive by drafting in several NGOs, local market committees and religious groups. ‚ÄúWe administered 1.35 lakh doses between June 22 and July 9 as we aggressively set up camps and reached out to community leaders. We also provided transport facilities to recipients,‚Äù said an official in the Ambala health department. Faridabad has also done reasonably well ‚Äî against a projected population of 20.75 lakh, it has managed to administer 9.42 lakh doses so far, which means 45.4% of its population has got at least one dose. Rewari has covered 43.3% of its population of 10.33 lakh so far. Sonipat, another large NCR district has, however, been lagging. With a projected population of 17.07 lakh, it has administered 5.39 lakh doses so far (31.6% coverage), while Karnal, which has a population similar to Gurgaon (17.38 lakh), has administered 5.24 lakh doses, covering 30% of its population. Haryana had given 70.32 lakh doses till June 21, which rose to 96.08 lakh by July 9. This means that between June 22 and July 9, the state administered over 25.76 lakh doses, which is more than a fourth of all doses administered so far. The districts that witnessed the maximum increase in vaccinations between June 22 and July 9 are Gurgaon (with a 63.1% rise since June 21), Charkhi Dadri (50.8%), Fatehabad (42.8%), Kaithal (40.2%) and Hisar (38.2%).  Palwal witnessed the least improvement in vaccinations in this period at 19.1%, followed by Ambala (26.1%), Sonipat (28.3%), Rohtak (29.2%) and Yamunanagar (29.5%). The districts with the least vaccination coverage as of July 9 are Nuh (9.3%), Jind (18.2%), Hisar (20.5%), Kaithal (22.7%) and Panipat (23.9%). These districts have the maximum rural areas where vaccine hesitancy still prevails. Officials said the state is focusing more on rural areas now to step up vaccinations. ‚ÄúThe pace of vaccinations has seen a steep rise in Haryana in the last one month, especially after the Centre revised its guidelines and said private hospitals would be supplied doses via the state government from June 21,‚Äù said Dr Virender Ahlawat, the state‚Äôs immunisation officer. ‚ÄúOn July 7, a revised communication stated that hospitals must place orders for doses through Co-WIN. This aims to further give a boost to the vaccination drive.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/vax-speed-up-since-june-21-but-single-dose-coverage-above-50-in-only-3-districts/articleshow/84306896.cms||Ipsita Pati
