The department's Office of Legal Counsel reversed course and declared that the department erred in 2019 when Trump was still in office when it found that the request for his taxes by the Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee was based on a "disingenuous" objective aimed at exposing them to the public. "We cannot know where receipt of the requested tax information will take the committee, any more than the committee itself can predict what it will find or determine," wrote Acting Assistant Attorney General Dawn Johnsen for the Office of Legal Counsel. However, Johnsen noted, "the respect due a co-equal branch of government requires that we presume the Committee will handle the tax information it receives with sensitivity to taxpayer privacy concerns." Unlike other recent presidents, Trump did not publicly disclose his tax returns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-justice-department-says-irs-must-provide-former-president-trumps-tax-returns-to-congress/articleshow/84905070.cms||---

A drone with blinking light was also spotted thrice at different locations in Samba district on Thursday night. The incidents come after almost a week after Jammu and Kashmir Police claimed to have achieved major success by foiling a terror plot executed by Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) by shooting down a hexacopter carrying an improvised explosive device weighing 5 kg near international border in Akhnoor’s Kanachak area. The villagers had spotted a blinking light on Thursday night and informed the police. “As per locals, the blinking light, probably a drone, was spotted near Bhalwal in Pargwal village close to the international border in Akhnoor,” the police said. The police immediately swung into action and launched a search operation but found nothing. The searches were also carried out on Friday morning at the location identified by the villagers. Samba senior superintendent of police (SSP) Rajesh Sharma said a suspicious flying object, possibly a drone with blinking white light, was spotted at three locations in Samba. “Activities were reported near Army camp in Bari Brahmana, Sandi village near ITBP camp, Ghagwal and border area village Chalarian Samba.” Border Security Force (BSF) personnel fired a couple of rounds towards a drone hovering in Chalarian before it returned to the Pakistani side, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/days-after-hexacopter-shot-down-by-cops-uavs-spotted-in-akhnoor-and-samba/articleshow/84905602.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Ex-police officer jailed awaiting trial in Capitol riot case||WASHINGTON: A federal judge has ordered the pretrial detention of a former police officer from Virginia who is accused of ordering guns after he was charged with participating in the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. US District Judge Christopher Cooper agreed on Wednesday to keep Thomas Robertson jailed, ruling the former Rocky Mount police officer violated terms of his pretrial release by possessing firearms. The judge rejected Robertson's suggestion that 34 guns he ordered before June 29, when FBI agents searched his home, are simply World War II collectables. A government inventory of the guns shows that many of them are recent vintage military-style assault weapons, including three M4 shotguns, Cooper said. A gun dealer in Roanoke, Virginia, told the FBI that Robertson had 34 guns waiting for him to pick up and that he had recently visited the store to handle them. "Here, a reasonable person could draw the inference that Robertson acted with consciousness of guilt in ordering firearms and ammunition for delivery to the gun dealer. It appears that Robertson may have attached the label 'Wedding Photos' to a Venmo transaction that was actually for ammunition, suggesting an effort to avoid detection," the judge wrote. The town of Rocky Mount fired Robertson and a second officer, Jacob Fracker, accused of storming the Capitol. Robertson has pleaded not guilty to a charge of obstructing an official proceeding. Robertson was freed after his initial arrest but arrested again July 7 after prosecutors urged the judge to revoke his pretrial release. The judge noted that Robertson is not accused of engaging in any violence on January 6 but said that the "strong weight of the evidence'' shows he participated in the Capitol riot. "Since that incident, both before and after his indictment, Robertson has expressed pride in his role and enthusiasm for the prospect of future political violence,'' Cooper wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ex-police-officer-jailed-awaiting-trial-in-capitol-riot-case/articleshow/84905473.cms||---

When two bike-borne chain-snatchers had a field day a month ago, young IPS officer and Bengaluru Rural district superintendent of police Kona Vamsi Krishna did not press the panic button. Taking it as a challenge, he calmly told his men: “Let’s stop them.” On Friday, the police team announced that they nabbed two ‘high-flying’ inter-state chain-snatchers and recovered nearly half-a-kilogram of gold from them. The arrested are Arjun Kumar alias Arjun Singh, 33, and Rakesh alias Raki, both residents of Ludhiana in Punjab and from of Shamli district in Uttar Pradesh. With their arrest, cops have solved 11 cases registered in Avalahalli, AG Halli, Whitefield, Suryanagar, Hebbagodi, Hosakote, Sulibele, Sarjapur and Channarayapatna areas. “We had to get them before they targeted other victims,” said Vamsi Krishna. He put a team of 41 police personnel on the hunt, one of the biggest police operations in recent times. Apart from stepping up vigilance in their respective police limits, the cops started deploying all tools — picking up CCTV images of the accused, using mobile-tracking technologies and searching multiple premises — to zero in on the accused. They connected the dots by viewing around 1,500 hours of video footage sourced from nearly 500 CCTV cameras installed in areas where the duo struck. After 22 days of probe, Hoskote police inspector SR Manjunath and his team nabbed the two chain-snatchers on July 21, when they were getting ready to strike again. The accused were reportedly involved in more than 25 criminal cases in Salem and Krishnagiri districts in neighbouring Tamil Nadu in 2014 and had also been booked under the Goonda Act by the TN police before they came out from judicial custody and started operating in and around Bengaluru. They flew down to B’luru to do crimes Police said the two would travel in their own vehicles from Ludhiana to Delhi and take a flight to Bengaluru. They used a stolen bike in Bengaluru to commit crimes, parked the vehicle at the railway station and travelled back to their hometown by trains along with the booty to avoid detection at the airport. They targeted women on isolated stretches after approaching them on the pretext of asking for address or a route. The police teams were led by additional SP Lakshmi Ganesh and comprised DySPs T Rangappa and Umashankar MH along with inspectors Manjunath SR, Kempegowda, Rangaswamy HM, Gowtham, Srinivas, Raghavendra and Harish. Chandrashekar, IGP (central range), lauded the team for its efforts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/41-cops-nab-two-chain-snatchers-after-22-day-hunt/articleshow/84905653.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Chain-snatcher who ended life nursed political dreams||BENGALURU: A chain-snatcher who allegedly died by suicide after swallowing cyanide on Tuesday after seeing a police team closing in on him near Hoskote is said to have procured the chemical from a goldsmith in his village in Andhra Pradesh. Cops suspect C Shankar, a resident of B Kothakota in Chittoor district, AP, wanted to emerge as a political leader in his village and may have thought he would lose his reputation there if he was caught by police and hence may have died by suicide, fearing arrest. Shankar and his associate Chandrashekar were astride a bike and headed towards Bengaluru when a team of KR Puram police zeroed in on them. Cops were on the lookout for them in connection with a chain-snatching incident in KR Puram. Unaware of police following him, Shankar and Chandrashekar stopped by Anjaneyaswamy temple in Pillagumpa and were washing their legs and faces to offer prayers when cops got down from the car. Seeing them, Shankar swallowed the cyanide he was carrying and died instantly, while Chandrashekar was arrested. Police said Shankar purchased the cyanide from a goldsmith, who used it to extract and polish gold, in B Kothakota. “We need to find out what reason he furnished while procuring it and other details related to his death,” said D Devaraj, deputy commissioner of police (Whitefield division). Devaraj said Shankar was associated with a political party in Kothakota and ran a tomato mandi in his village. However, he was a notorious chain-snatcher since 2006 in Bengaluru. He initially started snatching chains in Girinagar, CK Achchukattu and other areas, and later spread his operations across the city. Chandrashekar worked for him at the mandi. “Recently, Shankar convinced Chandrashekar to join him in snatching chains in Bengaluru to make quick money. The duo snatched three chains in KR Puram recently,” Devaraj said. Though Shankar had been arrested several times, he was off police radar since 2009.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/chain-snatcher-who-ended-life-nursed-political-dreams/articleshow/84905657.cms||---
---||World||White House, Canada state support for new Detroit river span||DETROIT: The White House and Canada issued a joint statement of support for a commuter bridge that when completed will span the Detroit river, connecting Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. The statement issued Thursday calls the Gordie Howe International Bridge "a top infrastructure priority'' for both governments. "We're committed to continuing our support to ensure the project's state-of-the-art ports of entry are fully funded so vehicles can begin crossing the architecturally stunning cable-stayed structure once completed for the benefit of our shared prosperity,'' the statement read. It comes as US President Joe Biden and Republican senators try to work out a compromise over a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure package. 17 GOP senators joined all Democrats in voting this week to start a debate to consider the bill. The plan includes $550 billion in new spending beyond the typical highway and public works accounts. "This full-throated support of this vital bridge comes as President Biden and Congress continue to make progress on bipartisan and significant investment in transportation and other infrastructure,'' Michigan governor Whitmer said in her own statement. ''The ongoing construction of this bridge has created jobs on both sides of the border, and will continue to spur economic development for many years to come. This bridge also affirms Michigan's ongoing partnership with Canada, the top purchaser of US goods among countries.'' In 2012, then-goveror Rick Snyder and former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper struck a deal calling for Canada to pay for the bridge after the Republican governor ran into opposition in the GOP-led legislature. The $4.4 billion ($5.7 billion Canadian) six-lane, span is expected to open in late 2024. It's named for Gordie Howe, a native of Canada and hockey legend who starred for the Detroit Red Wings. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the Detroit-Windsor, Ontario, corridor was the busiest commercial land crossing on the US-Canada border, handling more than 30% of truck-hauled trade. The privately owned Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel are the only current commuter crossings between the cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/white-house-canada-state-support-for-new-detroit-river-span/articleshow/84905638.cms||---
---||India||Only 31% of Delhi’s informal workers got rations, 54% still have no ration cards: CPM survey||NEW DELHI: Only 31% poor residents of the national capital got 10 kilogram rations during the second wave of coronavirus pandemic, while 54% still do not have ration cards, a survey conducted by the CPM in New Delhi has shown. Releasing the survey on Friday, CPM leader and polit buro member Brinda Karat said the survey emphasised the urgent need for cash transfer of Rs 7500 per month and that the need of the hour not door-to-door ration but house-to-house survey and walk-in registration centres for those who need ration cards in Delhi. The survey was conducted by CPM Delhi State Committee and covered 1917 workers in the Delhi-NCR region during the first two weeks of June. In this survey, information was collected on three major aspects, including the impact of the second wave on employment conditions, exposure of working class households to Covid-19 during the second wave and the burden of health expenditure on these households due to Covid. The survey also assessed the access households have to subsidised food grain during the second wave. Professor Vikas Rawal of JNU, who assisted the survey, said major findings of the survey included a “devastating impact” of the second wave on leaving the majority population without employment, a significant proportion of them battling Covid infections and having to incur higher out-of-pocket expenditure on health than their earnings during the period. The survey shows that 54% of the respondents did not have ration cards and up to 78% have not been administered even a single shot of vaccine. Additionally, about 65% of the respondents had no employment at all in April and May, while even the rest faced considerable loss of employment. About 14% of them did not find any work for more than 30 days in two months. Nearly 6% did not find any work for 15-30 days in two months. The survey also shows that the loss of employment was worst among casual workers. About 72% of those who worked as casual workers before the second wave had no employment at all during April and May, while about 52% self-employed skilled workers were completely unemployed during April and May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/only-31-of-delhis-informal-workers-got-rations-54-still-have-no-ration-cards-cpm-survey/articleshow/84906579.cms||Swati Mathur

Newly elected Peruvian President Pedro Castillo planned to travel to the north of the country to survey the damage, said Alfredo Murgueytio, head of Peru's Civil Defense Institute (Indeci). Television footage showed frightened Peruvians scrambling into the streets as the earth rumbled in the northern coastal city of Piura. The tremor sent products on supermarket shelves tumbling to the floor and cut power to parts of the region. Local media reported minor damage to regional infrastructure, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or injuries. The quake was at a depth of 10 km (6.21 miles), GFZ said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/quake-strikes-peru-ecuador-border-region-minor-damages-reported/articleshow/84906410.cms||---
---||World||California wildfire flares but within line crews have built||PARADISE, CALIFORNIA: California's largest wildfire so far this year was flaring up Friday but it was because the flames were chewing through unburned islands of vegetation within a perimeter that firefighters have built, authorities said. The Dixie Fire covered 376 square miles (974 square kilometers) in the mountains of Northern California where 42 homes and other buildings have been destroyed and more than 10,000 are still threatened. The vegetation burning inside the fire on Thursday produced a huge ``fire cloud,`` towering columns of smoke and ash that can pose a danger to firefighters. Residents were given assurances that it had been expected and would happen again but did not mean crews were losing control they have the fire. ``There's nothing close to our line right now. It's all interior fuels burning,'' Mike Wink, an incident commander, said in an online briefing. The fire northeast of the town of Paradise, which was largely destroyed in 2018 by the nation's deadliest wildfire in a century, has been burning since July 13 and is more than 20% contained. In remote southern Oregon, the nation's largest wildfire was more than halfway contained after scorching over 646 square miles (1,673 square kilometers) in the Fremont-Winema National Forest. Active fire behavior there also was mainly interior pockets of vegetation burning, a situation report said. A historic drought and recent heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West. Scientists say climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. The U.S. Drought Monitor reported this week that while a robust monsoon has delivered drought-easing rainfall to the Southwest, critically dry conditions persist across Northern California and the Northwest, where there has been an expansion of ``exceptional drought,'' the worst category. Nearly 22,000 firefighters and support personnel were battling 83 large, active wildfires covering 2,720 square miles (7,044 square kilometers) in 13 states Friday, the National Interagency Fire Center said. ``Fire weather and the conditions of the fuels across the country continue to challenge wildland fire managers,'' an agency statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/california-wildfire-flares-but-within-line-crews-have-built/articleshow/84906647.cms||---
---||World||Delta not specifically targeting children: WHO||GENEVA: The Delta variant of the coronavirus is not specifically targeting children, the World Health Organization said Friday. The WHO's Covid-19 technical lead Maria Van Kerkhove said the evidence showed that the variant first detected in India was rather being transmitted among people who were socially mixing. "Let me be very clear: we are not seeing the Delta variant specifically target children," the US expert told a press conference. Delta has now been detected in 132 countries and is more transmissible than earlier versions of the virus, including other variants of concern. The UN health agency said work was under way to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of Delta and why it is more transmissible. "There was some suggestion that the variants were specifically targeting children, but that actually is not the case. What we are seeing is that the variants will target those who are socially mixing," Van Kerkhove said. "What we do see is that the variants that are circulating will infect people if they are not taking the proper precautions," she said, referring to measures such as physical distancing and avoiding gathering in poorly-ventilated, crowded indoor spaces. The WHO has published a plan detailing ways in which schools can reopen and stay open in safety. "But we do really need to drive down transmission in the communities to make sure that they can open safely," Van Kerkhove said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/delta-not-specifically-targeting-children-who/articleshow/84906608.cms||---
---||World||US regulators step up scrutiny of IPO hopefuls from China||NEW YORK: Chinese companies hoping to sell their shares in the United States must start making more disclosures about their potential risks before US regulators will allow them to list their stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the move Friday after Beijing said it would step up its supervision of Chinese companies listed overseas, including reviews of their cybersecurity. SEC Chair Gary Gensler pointed in particular to Chinese businesses that use shell companies to get around Chinese rules blocking foreign ownership for their industries. Under these deals, the Chinese business forms a shell company in the Cayman Islands or somewhere else. The shell company then sells its stock to investors after listing in New York. The shell company has no ownership of the Chinese company. Instead, it has service contracts with it. These arrangements are called variable interest entities, or "VIEs.'' "I worry that average investors may not realize that they hold stock in a shell company rather than a China-based operating company,'' Gensler said. Gensler said he asked the SEC's staff to makes sure such companies make several disclosures before an initial public offering of stock. Among them: They must make clear investors are buying shares of the shell company, not the China-based operating company, and that future actions by the Chinese government could significantly affect financial performance. Gensler also said that all Chinese companies trying for a US IPO must disclose risks that approvals from Chinese authorities to list on a US exchange could be rescinded, among other things. Several big-name Chinese companies have seen their stocks tumble recently as Beijing has stepped up regulation of their data protection and security. US-listed shares of ride-hailing company Didi Global, for example, have been falling since they began trading at the end of June. They dropped nearly 20% in their fourth day of trading after the company was ordered to stop signing up new users and remove its app from online stores while it increases security for customer information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-regulators-step-up-scrutiny-of-ipo-hopefuls-from-china/articleshow/84907033.cms||---
---||World||Greece accuses aid groups of helping smugglers of migrants||ATHENS: As Greece faces criticism for its quick return of migrants across the Aegean Sea to Turkey, it is cracking down on the activities of some aid groups working with refugees, accusing them of facilitating trafficking rackets and spying. The Greek authorities have also stepped up accusations against Turkey for failing to stop boats smuggling migrants from leaving its shores, violating a deal struck between Turkey and the European Union at the peak of the refugee crisis in 2016. Last week, police on the Greek island of Lesbos said they had drafted a criminal case against 10 foreigners, including four members of foreign nongovernmental aid organizations, who face charges of facilitating the illegal entry of migrants and espionage. The announcement came 10 months after police on Lesbos drew up a similar case against 33 employees of aid groups that also included charges of running a criminal organization and violating laws covering state secrets. A spokesperson for the northern Aegean police, Nikolas Ververis, said Thursday that both cases were with prosecutors and that there had not been any arrests. He declined to name the aid groups in question as the investigation was ongoing. Greek authorities, who have also faced criticism for prosecuting migrants on charges of people smuggling, have suggested that certain aid groups are helping smugglers. The Lesbos police last week accused those being investigated of “providing essential assistance to organized networks for the illegal smuggling of migrants” under the guise of humanitarian aid. It said they used mobile messaging apps to provide migrants leaving Turkish shores with details about Greek coast guard operations, the positions of military facilities and other information. Although it was not named by Greek authorities, the Norwegian organization Aegean Boat Report, which monitors migrant arrivals, said allegations in the Greek media of its involvement with smuggling rings were “baseless and incorrect.” “The Greek government’s priorities, sadly, seem far removed from those of us who work to promote and safeguard the security and human rights of men, women and children seeking safety,” the organization said via Facebook Messenger. Greece has repeatedly denied accusations that it is pushing migrants back to Turkey, despite evidence to the contrary compiled by aid and media groups. It says it rescues thousands of people at sea while guarding its own borders and those of Europe. Although arrivals from Turkey have slowed considerably — they are down 96% since last year — Greece and Turkey remain at loggerheads over how to deal with migration flows following a dispute over maritime boundaries last summer that brought them close to conflict. After a smuggling boat sank off Crete last week, leaving at least seven migrants missing, Greece’s migration ministry referred to a “needless tragedy” that Turkey could have averted. On Friday, the Greek coast guard entered Turkish waters to save 10 migrants after another boat sank and Turkey failed to react, Greece’s migration minister, Notis Mitarachi, told the country’s Parliament, noting that three migrants were missing. Mitarachi, who in December accused Turkey and unnamed aid groups of facilitating smuggling rackets, did not respond to a request to comment about the activities of the aid groups. It is not the first time that aid groups have found themselves in Greece’s cross hairs. In 2015 and 2016, when more than a million migrants streamed into Greece and overwhelmed its resources, aid groups stepped in. In 2018, four aid group volunteers, including Syrian refugee Sara Mardini, who is the sister of Olympic swimmer Yusra Mardini, faced similar charges. After several months in detention, they were released pending their trial, which has yet to take place. Last year, Greece’s conservative government introduced tougher rules for the operation of dozens of nongovernmental organizations, ostensibly to boost transparency and accountability. But the rules made it difficult for some organizations to operate. The Council of Europe has called for those restrictions to be revoked. Adriana Tidona, a European migration researcher for Amnesty International, said the regulations and the criminal case against the aid groups were of great concern. “In the past, we have seen Greek authorities senselessly pursuing humanitarian actors for providing assistance to asylum seekers and migrants,” she said. “That shouldn’t continue.” She added that the criminal charges worsen a climate that is already restrictive for aid groups. New laws — both administrative and criminal — are also being applied in Italy, Spain, France and Cyprus to obstruct the activities of the groups, she said. Iason Apostolopoulos, an aid group employee, had been scheduled to receive an award from the Greek government for rescuing migrants, but that honor was withdrawn, apparently due to his criticism of the country’s migrant policy. No official reason was given, but a prominent lawmaker from the ruling party referred on Twitter to the aid worker’s criticism of government policies. According to Tidona, the fact that alleged human rights abuses, like pushbacks of migrant boats and violence at the borders, were not properly investigated and “heavily politicized” was affecting the public perception of people who work for aid groups dealing with migrants. A report by Amnesty International last year said that aid workers and journalists were being harassed for their activities related to the migrant crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/greece-accuses-aid-groups-of-helping-smugglers-of-migrants/articleshow/84907090.cms||---
---||World||With evictions looming, Congress strains to extend ban||WASHINGTON: Hours before a nationwide eviction moratorium is set to expire, Congress raced Friday to try to extend the ban in a long-shot effort to prevent millions of Americans from being forced from their homes during a Covid-19 surge. A House panel convened to consider emergency legislation to extend the ban, which expires Saturday. But no vote has been set. Congressional leaders and the White House struggled to rally support. More than 3.6 million Americans are at risk of eviction, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has implored colleagues to act, calling it a “moral imperative” to protect renters and also the landlords who are owed compensation. But facing difficulty in quickly passing a measure through Congress, Pelosi on Friday urged the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to continue the moratorium, despite President Joe Biden’s announcement ruling out administration action. She was preparing legislation that would direct the CDC to extend the ban through Oct. 18, in line with the health emergency. An earlier proposal that would have continued the moratorium through Dec. 31 lacked support. “It is our hope that we could pass a bill extending the eviction moratorium to that date immediately,” Pelosi said in a letter to colleagues. Biden said Thursday that the administration’s hands are tied after the Supreme Court signaled the moratorium would only be extended until the end of the month. Pelosi said Friday at the Capitol that the sight of families’ belongings piled on the street is “wrenching” and must be prevented as the states struggle to distribute some $47 billion in federal funds to renters and landlords. Congress must “meet the needs of the American people: both the families unable to make rent and those to whom the rent is to be paid,” she said earlier in a letter. Not all lawmakers are on board with an extension, and the House is preparing to leave Friday for a scheduled recess. The Senate is also considering emergency legislation, but passage in that 50-50 chamber would be even more difficult. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., the Financial Services Committee chair who wrote the emergency bill, urged her colleagues to act. “Is it emergency enough that you’re going to stop families from being put on the street?” Waters said as the Rules Committee met to consider the bill. “What the hell is going to happen to these children?” But Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the top Republican on another panel handling the issue, said the Democrats’ bill was rushed. “This is not the way to legislate,” she said. Congress pushed nearly $47 billion to the states earlier in the Covid-19 crisis to shore up landlords and renters as workplaces shut down and many people were suddenly out of work. But lawmakers said state governments have been slow to distribute the money. On Friday, they said only some $3 billion has been spent. By the end of March, 6.4 million American households were behind on their rent, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. As of July 5, roughly 3.6 million people in the US said they faced eviction in the next two months, according to the US Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey. Some places are likely to see spikes in evictions starting Monday, while other jurisdictions will see an increase in court filings that will lead to evictions over several months. The ban was initially put in place to prevent further spread of Covid-19 by people put out on the streets and into shelters. “It’s incredibly important to move forward,” said deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre at the White House briefing. She said the administration backs the congressional effort “to extend the eviction moratorium to protect these vulnerable renters and their families.” The White House has been clear that Biden would have liked to extend the federal eviction moratorium because of the spread of the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. But there are also concerns that challenging the court could lead to a ruling restricting the administration’s ability to respond to future public health crises. The administration is trying to keep renters in place through other means. It released more than $1.5 billion in rental assistance in June, which helped nearly 300,000 households. Biden on Thursday asked the departments of Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture and Veterans Affairs to extend their eviction moratoriums on households living in federally insured, single-family homes through the end of September. On a 5-4 vote last month, the Supreme Court allowed the broad eviction ban to continue through the end of July. One of those in the majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, made clear he would block any additional extensions unless there was “clear and specific congressional authorization.” Aides to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, the chair of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, said the two were working on legislation to extend the moratorium and were asking Republicans not to block it. “The public health necessity of extended protections for renters is obvious,” said Diane Yentel, executive director of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “If federal court cases made a broad extension impossible, the Biden administration should implement all possible alternatives, including a more limited moratorium on federally backed properties.” Gene Sperling, who is charged with overseeing implementation of Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package, said it was key that states and local authorities speed up distribution of the billions in rental assistance approved earlier by Congress. Landlords, who have opposed the moratorium and challenged it repeatedly in court, are against any extension. They, too, are arguing for speeding up the distribution of rental assistance. The National Apartment Association and several others this week filed a federal lawsuit asking for $26 billion in damages because of the impact of the moratorium. “Any extension of the eviction moratorium equates to an unfunded government mandate that forces housing providers to deliver a costly service without compensation and saddles renters with insurmountable debt,” association president and CEO Bob Pinnegar said, adding that the current crisis highlights a need for more affordable housing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/with-evictions-looming-congress-strains-to-extend-ban/articleshow/84907387.cms||---

In a written response in the assembly, Rane said: “At no point in time (did) the oxygen supplies at GMC run out of stock, and thus, no death has been reported to have (been) caused due to the non-supply of oxygen.” TOI had reported that at least 83 people were suspected to have died due to oxygen-related issues between May 11 and May 15 while undergoing treatment for Covid at GMC. On May 11, at the peak of Covid second wave, Rane had made an announcement that 26 Covid patients had died between 2am and 6am due to oxygen shortage at GMC and asked the Bombay high court to probe the goings-on at GMC. Rane’s statement on May 11 came on a day when Goa recorded 75 Covid deaths, its highest-ever single-day tally. “On Monday (May 10), our requirement was about 1,200 cylinders, but we received 400 cylinders. The hospital has been facing a shortage of oxygen supply,” the health minister had said. CM Pramod Sawant, who had visited the Covid wards on May 11, had also hinted that there was oxygen shortage. But on Friday, in written replies to three questions, Rane not only denied there were any oxygen-related deaths but went further and lauded the government. “During sudden surge of active cases in the second week of May, the demand for oxygen had suddenly shot up. But due to extra efforts put in by the government, additional oxygen was made available and at no point in time, none of the government hospitals in the state ran out of oxygen supplies. Hence, no deaths due to lack of oxygen supplies have been reported in any government hospitals in the state till date,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-u-turn-goa-health-minister-says-no-deaths-due-to-oxygen-shortage-in-state/articleshow/84907490.cms||Lisa Monteiro

China claims the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet, a position firmly rejected by India. India says Arunachal is its integral part. The maps, wrapped in about 300 export consignments marked as “bedclothes”, were seized by the customs at Shanghai Pudong airport, Chinese daily the paper.cn reported. China passed a new regulation in 2019, making it mandatory for all maps being printed and sold in the country, including those meant for exports, to carry the official version of Chinese maps incorporating China’s claims including, Arunachal, Taiwan and the South China Sea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-seizes-maps-showing-arunachal-as-part-of-india/articleshow/84907651.cms||---
---||India||Now, Communists turn to Ram to counter Parivar||KOZHIKODE: CPI has become the latest outfit to warm up to the Ramayana, with its Malappuram district committee holding a series of online discourses on the epic to combat what it sees as appropriation of the ancient text by the Sangh Parivar and right-wing forces. The seven-day online talks on the Ramayana are being carried out on the Facebook page of the party district committee and has state-level CPI leaders as speakers. The series, titled “Ramayana and Indian Heritage”, which started on July 25, will conclude on Saturday. “Currently, communal and fascist forces are claiming exclusive rights over everything related to Hinduism, especially with society at large and other political parties ceding ground and moving away. Epics like the Ramayana are part of the shared tradition and culture of the country,” Malappuram CPI district secretary P K Krishnadas said. He added that holding a talk series on Ramayana was an attempt by the party to see how the epic should be read and understood in progressive times. The topics dealt with are diverse, like “People during the era of Ramayana and Political Links With Other Countries”, by CPI leader Mullakkara Ratnakaran; “Contemporary Politics in Ramayana”, by CPI fellow traveller M Keshavan Nair; “The Many Ramayanas”, by poet Alankode Leelakrishnan etc. In his talk on "Contemporary Politics in Ramayana", Nair said that the politics ingrained in the Ramayana was very different to that practised by the Sangh Parivar. “Lord Ram is shown as a confluence of contradictory forces, and for communists the first thing that comes to mind while taking a close look at the epic is the principle of dialectical materialism espoused by Karl Marx,” he said. Poet Leelakrishnan said communists have the responsibility to ensure that the Ramayana does not become a tool in the hands of communal forces. “We can resist fascist interpretations of the Ramayana by highlighting the diverse versions of the epic,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-communists-turn-to-ram-to-counter-parivar/articleshow/84907820.cms||---

The chief secretaries of Assam and Nagaland, who held a virtual meeting to work out the disengagement plan, have agreed to withdraw forces, weapons and structures from the spot — comprising Jankhana Nala or Aosenden village and a hilltop forest camp — and let the Assam forest department establish a watch post to protect the reserved forest area. There shall be a disengagement of forces from both sides, that is, Vikuto village area and Keremia tea estate. Both Assam and Nagaland forces will withdraw from the point of engagement at the hilltop forest camp and remove bunkers, tents or infrastructure. Sources said the two chief secretaries concurred that huts constructed by some Naga villagers by encroaching forest area in front of the Assam camp shall be removed. The chief secretaries agreed that Assam and Nagaland shall jointly monitor the area by patrolling and surveillance using unmanned aerial vehicles. Assam forest officials meanwhile shall continue their patrolling in the area. It was agreed to allow the immediate renovation of Assam’s New Chunthia border outpost in the Dessoi Valley Forest so that police personnel deployed there are not inconvenienced due to substandard living quarters. As the area is a reserved forest, the entry of civilians would have to be regulated by the jurisdictional forest authorities and both the states shall discourage movement of people from their side to avoid an unnecessary build up. It was agreed that the RCC bridge over the river of Jankhana constructed from Nagaland side shall be dismantled right away to prevent unauthorised free movement of people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mizoram-front-still-tense-assam-holds-border-talks-with-nagaland/articleshow/84907925.cms||Bharti Jain

Dawn reported that the decision was announced by the Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah during a press conference. According to the statement issued by the chief minister's office, restrictions will remain in place till August 8. However, businesses associated with the export sector will be allowed to operate. There will be a ban on inter-city travel and all markets will remain closed. Pharmacies, however, will remain open. Chief minister said due to the decisions taken by the provincial task force, Sindh was able to tackle the first, second and third waves of coronavirus relatively better than other provinces. "But in this fourth wave, the Delta variant is the main concern," he added. He noted that Karachi was the most affected city now, saying the virus spread fast in closed spaces and cases would multiply if measures were not taken to curb it. "Just a month ago, there were an average of 500 cases daily in Sindh by the end of June. And now by July's end, the number of daily cases has increased to 3,000," he said. Pakistan is reeling the rising number of coronavirus cases due to the Delta variant. There have also been reports of a shortage of Covid-19 vaccines due to a financial crunch. Amid such pandemic times, the news of misuse of funds for Covid-19 aid distribution is a shocker for its general populace. The country has reported nearly 4,500 new Covid-19 cases and 86 related deaths, of which 14 deaths were reported from Karachi in the last 24 hours on Friday. In Karachi, the highest positivity rate was recorded in east district at 33%, followed by 21% in Korangi district and 19% in west district. South and Malir districts reported a positivity rate of 17%each, reported Dawn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-sindh-province-set-to-undergo-partial-lockdown-from-today-till-august-8/articleshow/84907953.cms||---
---||World||South Dakota's Noem doesn't plan to ratchet up vaccine push||SIOUX FALLS, SD: South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem says she has no plans to ratchet up her messaging to urge people to get a Covid-19 vaccine, even as Republican leaders across the country try to persuade vaccine sceptics to roll up their sleeves and take the shots in response to a new, more contagious variant that has sent caseloads soaring in some parts of the country.  The Republican governor told The Associated Press this week she believes her messaging has reached "a saturation level where people start to tune you out.  South Dakota's Department of Health is trying a targeted approach to reach groups where vaccine uptake has been low. But it has been months since the governor used her position to encourage the vaccine, even with infections rising again in the state after a steep decline in the spring and early summer.  Noem's rise as a potential contender for the 2024 GOP presidential ticket has been mostly fueled by her hands-off approach to the pandemic - a distinction that may complicate her messaging to a Republican base that has rejected the vaccine in large numbers.  Other party leaders and conservative cable news personalities, facing a fresh wave of infections spurred by the delta virus variant, have sounded the alarm in recent weeks and tried to convince people to get the shot. Republican governors such as Arkansas' Asa Hutchinson, who recently took over as chairman of the National Governors Association, have called combating vaccine resistance a priority and used their positions to advocate for the shot.  Noem initially championed the arrival of the vaccine, putting out a video message in March to say she was "trusting people to do the right thing" in getting the shot and posting a social media photo of her rolling up a sleeve for it. She also touted how South Dakota initially had one of the country's highest rates of vaccinations. But the state's vaccination rate has since tumbled into the bottom half of states, with under half of the total population fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Meanwhile, virus cases in the state have more than doubled in the last two weeks, though the rate remained lower than at any other point besides the early days of the pandemic.  The governor acknowledged the delta variant poses a new risk.  "We might need to really step up our communication so that people understand how the variant is different," she said. "You might see more communication from us if we start seeing cases dramatically increase."  Public health officials believe the variant is at least twice as contagious as the original version, but the shots appear to offer robust protection against serious illness for most people. Nearly all Covid-19 deaths in the US are now people who haven't been vaccinated. Nonetheless, just 57.1% of Americans have received at least one vaccine dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Noem has held out against ordering people to wear masks, even as the state last year saw one of the worst virus surges in the country, and has raised doubts about the effectiveness of their widespread use in public. When the CDC this week offered new guidance for vaccinated people to return to wearing masks indoors in areas with high infection rates, she responded with a mocking Twitter meme.  She argued that governors who issued orders aimed at curbing infections were overstepping the bounds of their office.  "Any other governor that took a stronger mitigation measure, they broke their oath to the Constitution," she said. "Every governor that closed a business could be sued for the taking of that business."  Her approach has drawn widespread attention, as well as criticism. In a wide-ranging interview with the AP as she returned from a visit to the US border with Mexico, Noem discussed how she has not shied away from controversy during her first term in office, and at times sees the backlash as an advantage.  Before the pandemic, Noem was perhaps best known for being nationally lampooned for an anti-drug campaign that used the tagline, "Meth. We're On It." She said she has no regrets about approving the ads, especially after seeing South Dakota become one of just two states that saw drug-related overdoses decline in 2020.  "Every addiction counsellor and even addicts told me, 'I know that people are making fun of this campaign, but everybody's talking about it and that's the first step to getting people into addiction treatment,'" she said. "We got more people into addiction treatment after that campaign than we had the previous three or four years combined."  However, she did acknowledge the political risk that comes with another unpopular stance she has taken: opposition to recreational marijuana. South Dakota voters approved legalizing it last year, but Noem launched a lawsuit challenging the measure on constitutional grounds. A circuit court struck down the law, though an appeal is pending before the state Supreme Court.  "I don't feel like I should have changed my position, but I could have communicated it better," Noem said. "I think public opinion polls would say, just let it go. But 10 years from now, there's going to be real consequences, real costs to families, real costs to the government."  In a state dominated by Republicans, it's not clear if Democrats have much chance to unseat Noem in next year's midterm election. Noem has burnished her conservative track record and described seeing the state as a "pilot project" for conservative policies.  "It's a different way of approaching the same problems every state has, except doing it from a conservative, smaller government mindset," she said.  However, so far, many of her stump speeches have occurred at conservative gatherings and fundraisers outside the state rather than in South Dakota, fueling criticism she is more focused on a 2024 White House bid than on being governor. She also has hammered hard on national issues sure to rile the GOP's base.  But Noem denies she is angling for anything beyond being South Dakota's governor, saying, "Anybody who wants to run for president should never be president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/south-dakotas-noem-doesnt-plan-to-ratchet-up-vaccine-push/articleshow/84908210.cms||---
---||India||NSO has blocked Pegasus use by some governments: Reports||Israeli surveillance software company NSO Group has temporarily blocked several government clients around the world from using its Pegasus spyware as the company investigates its possible misuse, Washington-based non-profit media outlet NPR reported. The development also follows raids on some offices of the NSO Group on Wednesday by Israeli government agencies “to begin assessing” security breach allegations against the company’s Pegasus spyware. Meanwhile, French authorities have found traces of Pegasus software on the phones of several French targets on Amnesty and Forbidden Stories’ list – providing independent corroboration of this month’s explosive reports, a tweet by a Reuters correspondent said, quoting La Monde and an online investigative journal, Mediapart. According to NPR, NSO Group suspending supply of the software is in response to an investigation by the Pegasus Project, a consortium of media outlets that reported that the company's Pegasus spyware was linked to hacks and potential surveillance of telephones of people including journalists, human rights activists and heads of state. “There is an investigation into some clients. Some of those clients have been temporarily suspended,” said the source in the company, who – according to NPR – spoke on condition of anonymity because company policy states that NSO “will no longer be responding to media inquiries on this matter and it will not play along with the vicious and slanderous campaign.” NPR reported that the company employee would not name or quantify the government agencies — or their countries — that NSO has recently suspended from using its spyware, asserting that Israeli defence regulations prohibit the company from identifying its clients. NSO says it has 60 customers in 40 countries, all of them intelligence agencies, law enforcement bodies and militaries. It says in recent years, before the media reports, it blocked its software from five governmental agencies, including two in the past year, after finding evidence of misuse, NPR reported. NSO’s ongoing internal investigation checked some of the telephone numbers of people that NSO’s clients reportedly marked as potential targets. “Almost everything we checked, we found no connection to Pegasus,” the employee told NPR, declining to elaborate on potential misuse NSO may have uncovered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nso-has-blocked-pegasus-use-by-some-governments-reports/articleshow/84908137.cms||---
---||World||WHO urges action to suppress Covid before deadlier variants emerge||GENEVA: The Delta variant of Covid-19 is a warning to the world to suppress the virus quickly before it mutates again into something even worse, the WHO said Friday. The highly-transmissible variant, first detected in India, has now surfaced in 132 countries and territories, the World Health Organization said. "Delta is a warning: it's a warning that the virus is evolving but it is also a call to action that we need to move now before more dangerous variants emerge," the WHO's emergencies director Michael Ryan told a press conference. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus added: "So far, four variants of concern have emerged and there will be more as long as the virus continues to spread." Tedros said that on average, infections increased by 80 percent over the past four weeks in five of the six WHO regions. Though Delta has shaken many countries, Ryan said proven measures to bring transmission under control still worked notably physical distancing, wearing masks, hand hygiene and avoiding long periods indoors in poorly ventilated, busy places. "They are stopping the Delta strain, especially when you add in vaccination," he said. "The virus has got fitter, the virus has got faster. The game plan still works, but we need to implement and execute our game plan much more efficiently and much more effectively then we've ever done before." The UN health agency has consistently called for vaccines to be distributed evenly around the world and has branded the drastic imbalance a "moral outrage". More than four billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines have now been administered globally, according to an AFP count. In countries categorised as high income by the World Bank, 98 doses per 100 people have been injected. That figure drops to 1.6 per 100 in the 29 lowest-income countries. If the four billion doses had been administered equally to people aged over 60, "we basically could have gotten two doses into everybody at highest risk of severe consequences when we got to a strain like Delta", said Bruce Aylward, the WHO's frontman on the Covax scheme which aims to get donor-funded jabs to poorer countries. Instead, those nations, "in the face of the Delta variant they're going to pay a very, very different price as a result". The WHO wants every country to have vaccinated at least 10 percent of its population by the end of September; at least 40 percent by the end of this year, and 70 percent by the middle of 2022. "We are a long way off achieving those targets," Tedros lamented. He said that just over half of the 194 WHO member states have fully vaccinated 10 percent of their population; less than a quarter have vaccinated 40 percent; and only three countries have vaccinated 70 percent. Meanwhile the WHO says Burundi, Eritrea and North Korea are the only remaining member states yet to start Covid-19 vaccination campaigns. The novel coronavirus has killed at least 4.2 million people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, while nearly 196.6 million cases have been registered, according to tallies from official sources compiled by AFP. Tedros said that on current rates of infection, the 200 million known infections mark will be surpassed within the next two weeks, although the true figure will be much higher. "There are no magical solutions," said Ryan. "The only magic dust we have is vaccination. The problem is we're not sprinkling that evenly around the world and we are working against ourselves."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/who-urges-action-to-suppress-covid-before-deadlier-variants-emerge/articleshow/84908516.cms||---
---||World||Carl Levin, Michigan's longest-serving senator, dies at 87||DETROIT: Famous for gazing over eyeglasses worn on the end of his nose, Carl Levin seemed at ease wherever he went, whether attending a college football game back home in Michigan or taking on a multibillion-dollar corporation before cameras on Capitol Hill.  Michigan's longest-serving US senator had a slightly rumpled, down-to-earth demeanour that helped him win over voters throughout his 36-year career, as did his staunch support for the hometown auto industry. But the Harvard-educated attorney also was a respected voice on military issues, spending years leading the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee.  Despite his record tenure and status, he kept his role in perspective. At his direction, the portraits of all 38 senators who had served before or with him since Michigan's statehood in 1837 were hung in his office conference room. Two empty spaces were reserved for future senators.  "I'm part of a long trail of people who have represented Michigan," Levin said in 2008. "I'm just part of that history. The people coming after me can pick up where I leave off, whoever they might be."  The former taxi driver and auto-line worker, who for decades kept his faded 1953 union card in his wallet, died Thursday at 87. His family and the Levin Center at Wayne State University's law school did not release a cause of death in an evening statement. He had been living with lung cancer since age 83.  "We are all devastated by his loss. But we are filled with gratitude for all of the support that Carl received throughout his extraordinary life and career, enabling him to touch so many people and accomplish so much good," the statement said.  First elected to the Senate in 1978, Levin represented Michigan longer than any other senator, targeting tax shelters, supporting manufacturing jobs and pushing for military funding. His tenure was a testament to voters' approval of the slightly rumpled, down-to-earth Detroit native whom Time magazine ranked among the nation's 10 best senators in 2006.  "He's just a very decent person," Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a fellow Senate Armed Services Committee member, said in 2008. "He's unpretentious, unassuming. He never forgets that what we're doing is enmeshed with the lives of the people he represents."  A Washington insider and former prosecutor are known for his professorial bearing, Levin took a civil but straightforward approach that allowed him to work effectively with Republicans and fellow Democrats. He was especially astute on defence matters thanks to his years as the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.  And he didn't fear speaking his mind.  He was in the minority - even among his Democratic Senate colleagues - when he voted against sending U.S. troops to Iraq in 2002, and two years later he said President George W. Bush's administration had "written the book on how to mismanage a war." He gave a cautious endorsement to President Barack Obama's 2009 buildup of troops in Afghanistan but later warned of "the beginnings of fraying" of Democratic support.  He was also critical of President Ronald Reagan's buildup of nuclear weapons, saying it came at the expense of conventional weapons needed to maintain military readiness.  But, colleagues said, he almost always engendered a feeling of respect.  "We've always had a very trusting and respectful relationship," the late-Republican Sen. John Warner, who worked closely for years with Levin on the Armed Services Committee, once said. "We do not try to pull surprises on each other. The security of the nation and the welfare of the armed services come first."  Famous for wearing his eyeglasses down on his nose, Levin seemed to be the same candid, hardworking guy wherever he went, whether he was in front of cameras on Capitol Hill, on an overseas fact-finding mission or lost in the crowd of a college football stadium on game day.  "No one would accuse Carl Levin of looking like Hollywood's version of a US Senator. He's pudgy, balding and occasionally rumpled, and he constantly wears his glasses at the very tip of his nose," Time magazine said in its 2006 article ranking the senator among the country's best. "Still, the Michigan Democrat has gained respect from both parties for his attention to detail and deep knowledge of policy, especially in his role as a vigilant monitor of businesses and federal agencies."  A foe of fraud and waste, Levin led an investigation in 2002 into Enron Corp., which had declared bankruptcy the previous year amid financial scandals. The probe contributed to a new federal law that requires executives to sign off on financial statements so they could be criminally liable for posting phoney numbers.  Levin pushed legislation designed to crack down on offshore tax havens, which he said cost the US government at least $100 billion a year in lost taxes. He also was an advocate for stem cell research and gun control.  Closer to home, Levin promoted policies benefiting the auto industry and supported giving $25 billion in loan guarantees to General Motors and Chrysler. He argued that a vibrant domestic auto industry was crucial to rebuilding the economy after the Great Recession. He also was a member of a task force supporting efforts to fight pollution and other environmental problems affecting the Great Lakes.  "If you've ever worn the uniform, worked a shift on an assembly line, or sacrificed to make ends meet, then you've had a voice and a vote in Sen. Carl Levin," Obama said in 2013. "No one has worked harder to bring manufacturing jobs back to our shores, close unfair tax loopholes and ensure that everyone plays by the same set of rules."  Carl Milton Levin was born in Detroit on June 28, 1934, and he stayed in the Motor City for most of his life. After high school, he spent time as a taxi driver and worked on auto assembly plant lines to help put himself through school.  Always proud of having helped build the DeSoto and Ford trucks at a plant in Highland Park, he held onto his United Auto Workers union membership card for decades. That ended when his wallet was stolen.  He earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Swarthmore College in 1956, and a law degree from Harvard in 1959. He married his wife, Barbara, two years later, and together they raised three daughters.  Levin fell in line with his family's strong sense of civic duty in 1964, when he was named an assistant state attorney general and the first general counsel for the Michigan Civil Rights Commission. His older brother, former longtime U.S. Rep. Sander "Sandy" Levin, had a liberal voting record on many social issues, while their father served on the Michigan Corrections Commission, a citizens' group that oversaw prison operations, and their mother volunteered for a Jewish organization.  Carl Levin was Michigan's only Jewish senator. He once said that public service was in his DNA, and politics often was discussed at the dinner table when he was a boy.  He dove into the public office when Detroit voters elected him to the City Council in 1969, and he served as its president before ousting a Republican to win the 1978 Senate race. He won the seat five more times but decided against running for a seventh term in 2014.  Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called Levin a "champion for Michigan."  "He saw what we were capable of when we came to the table as Michiganders, as Americans, to get things done," she said. "Carl devoted his life to public service, and it us up to us to follow his example."  After his retirement, the Levin Center at Wayne Law was established to promote fact-based, bipartisan oversight by Congress and state legislatures and to encourage civil dialogue on public policy issues. He chaired the center and co-taught law courses. He also was a partner and distinguished counsel at the Honigman law firm in Detroit.  His memoir, "Getting to the Heart of the Matter: My 36 Years in the Senate," was published in March. The Navy named a destroyer for him to honor his years of public service.  His nephew, Andy Levin, was reelected in 2020 to his father's 9th Congressional District seat that represents parts of suburban Detroit.  "Carl Levin personified integrity and the notion of putting the public good above self-interest," Andy Levin said, calling him "the very picture of sober purpose and rectitude. In truth, he wasn't unfun. In fact, he often pierced tense situations with self-deprecating humour, and he privately shared incisive observations about others with staff and colleagues."  Carl Levin is survived by his wife, their three adult daughters, Kate, Laura and Erica, and several grandchildren. There will be a private funeral. Information about a public memorial will be forthcoming.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/carl-levin-michigans-longest-serving-senator-dies-at-87/articleshow/84908692.cms||---

They rose by 100 cases to 1,859 on Thursday. On Friday, the state reported 1,947 new cases. Coimbatore, where industries are back to working at full strength, and Chennai are seeing small clusters that are contributing to the rise in cases. This has not come as a surprise to the state health department, which expected the decline in cases to slow two weeks after lockdown relaxations. A week after every phase of unlocking, the rate of fall declined. “Any spike in cases is a cause of concern, particularly with neighbouring Kerala reporting high numbers,” said health minister Ma Subramanian. In February 2021, when the epidemic wave was receding, similar clusters — hostels, hotels, and family reunions — marked the beginning of the deadly wave. On Friday, Coimbatore crossed the 200-mark. “We have now identified two areas — Sulur and Karamadai — which are beginning to see an increase in cases,” Coimbatore deputy director of public health Dr Senthil Kumar said. The challenge now is to ensure the curve does not go up again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-tamil-nadu-cluster-infections-up-a-cause-for-worry/articleshow/84909015.cms||---

Secretary of state Antony Blinken said 182 Russian employees and dozens of contractors in Moscow, Vladivostok and Yekaterinburg would be let go after a Russian government order in April in retaliation for US actions against Russia. "Starting in August, the Russian government is prohibiting the United States from retaining, hiring, or contracting Russian or third-country staff, except our guard force," Blinken said in a statement. "These unfortunate measures will severely impact the US mission to Russia's operations, potentially including the safety of our personnel as well as our ability to engage in diplomacy with the Russian government," he said. In April, Washington expelled 10 Russian diplomats, expanded restrictions on Russian banks and blacklisted 32 Russians over the Kremlin's US election interference, a massive cyberattack and other hostile activity. In retaliation, Russia expelled 10 US diplomats and forbid the US mission from hiring non-US nationals, starting on August 1. The moves intensified the chill between the two powers that was not improved after President Joe Biden's summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in June in Geneva. "Although we regret the actions of the Russian government forcing a reduction in our services and operations, the United States will follow through on our commitments while continuing to pursue a predictable and stable relationship with Russia," Blinken said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/us-says-moscow-forcing-it-to-fire-russian-embassy-employees/articleshow/84909023.cms||---

Tamil Nadu has inoculated the largest number of pregnant women so far with 78,838 doses administered, followed by Andhra Pradesh (34,228), Odisha (29,821), Madhya Pradesh (21,842), Kerala (18,423) and Karnataka (16,673). This assumes significance, as pregnant women are among the high-risk population as the chance of developing the severe disease due to Covid-19 infection leading to preterm delivery and complications in both the mother and the child, are high.  The substantial vaccination coverage against Covid-19 among pregnant women in a short span of time is driven by regular counselling of pregnant women by health workers and medical officers about risks of Covid-19 infection to pregnant women and benefits of vaccination, the government said. Several initiatives have been taken by states to encourage pregnant women to take vaccine, such as counselling of eligible beneficiaries by frontline workers and counsellors at antenatal clinics, mobilisation by ASHAs, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-over-2-lakh-pregnant-women-take-first-dose-in-a-month/articleshow/84909134.cms||---
---||India||Opposition stalls Parliament; Pegasus ‘non-issue’, says minister||NEW DELHI: After another day of virtual washout in Parliament, Congress on Friday blamed the government for the deadlock, accusing it of running away from a discussion on Pegasus snooping issue which, the party said, led to continuing protests by the opposition. “The government should agree to a discussion on the Pegasus issue. Saving privacy, fundamental rights and democracy is very important in the country and Pegasus is linked to this,” Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said. He also said he had conveyed to Rajnath Singh, Piyush Goyal and Pralhad Joshi that the simplest way to ensure the House runs is to discuss Pegasus issue on the floor of the House. “We will let the House run,” he said citing reports of Israeli government’s raids on NSO group, the developer of Pegasus spyware. Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said the Pegasus controversy is a “non-issue” and that the government is ready for discussions on people-related issues. Rajya Sabha passed the Coconut Development Board (Amendment) Bill 2021 in the midst of protests. Amid the din, two bills were introduced before the House was adjourned. The government introduced two bills — Limited Liability Partnership (Amendment) Bill and The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (Amendment) Bill — in the House. In the morning, RS chairman Venkaiah Naidu expressed concern over opposition members whistling in the House and holding placards in front of ministers during proceedings. “There are two ways to deal with this. Allow the House to become a bazaar or take action,” Naidu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/opposition-stalls-parliament-pegasus-non-issue-says-minister/articleshow/84909385.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court to hear next week journos’ pleas on Pegasus row probe||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear next week PILs seeking a court-monitored probe into alleged illegal use of military-grade spyware Pegasus by the Union government to snoop into mobile phones of politicians, journalists, lawyers and activists on the ground that the acts were in violation of the right to privacy. After serial PIL litigant advocate M L Sharma moved the SC seeking a court-monitored probe into the Pegasus controversy, noted journalists N Ram and Sasi Kumar jointly filed a PIL seeking similar relief and urged the court to query the Centre whether the government or any of its agencies had obtained licence from Israeli firm NSO for use of of the spyware for surveillance or any other purpose. Appearing for Ram and Kumar, senior advocate Kapil Sibal mentioned their PIL before a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justice Surya Kant and sought urgent hearing saying the ramifications of the Pegasus issue are enormous in terms of violation of a cluster of fundamental rights of citizens. “We need a hearing on this issue. It is creating waves in India and the world over,” Sibal said. The bench agreed to post it for hearing next week. Ram and Kumar requested the SC to “issue a writ/order or direction in the nature of mandamus or any other appropriate writ constituting an inquiry to investigate the extent of surveillance on Indian citizens using Pegasus spyware and the entities responsible for it, headed by a sitting or retired judge of the Supreme Court duly nominated by the court”. They said forensic analyses of several mobile phones belonging to persons targeted for surveillance by the security lab of Amnesty International have confirmed Pegasus-induced security breaches. “Such mass surveillance using a military-grade spyware abridges several fundamental rights and appears to represent an attempt to infiltrate, attack and destabilise independent institutions that act as critical pillars of our democratic set-up. It is also concerning that the Union government has not categorically ruled out obtaining Pegasus licences to conduct surveillance in their response, and have taken no steps to ensure a credible and independent investigation,” they said. Terming the hacking of phones of civilians using a military-grade spyware as ‘cyber-terrorism’, the petitioners said, “The devices of government ministers, political figures and constitutional functionaries which may contain sensitive information have been targeted. This has wide-reaching ramifications for governance and administration. It is imperative that a thorough and independent investigation be conducted to assess the source and nature of the threat posed by the Pegasus hack”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-to-hear-next-week-journos-pleas-on-pegasus-row-probe/articleshow/84909441.cms||---
---||World||CDC study: Vaccinated people can carry as much virus as others||In another dispiriting setback for the nation's efforts stamp out the coronavirus, scientists who studied a big Covid-19 outbreak in Massachusetts concluded that vaccinated people who got so-called breakthrough infections carried about the same amount of the coronavirus as those who did not get the shots. Health officials on Friday released details of that research, which was key in this week's decision by the centers for disease control and Prevention to recommend that vaccinated people return to wearing masks indoors in parts of the US where the delta variant is fueling infection surges. The authors said the findings suggest the CDC's mask guidance should be expanded to include the entire country, even outside of hot spots. The findings have the potential to upend past thinking about how the disease is spread. Previously, vaccinated people who got infected were thought to have low levels of virus and to be unlikely to pass it to others. But the new data shows that is not the case with the delta variant. The outbreak in Provincetown - a seaside tourist spot on Cape Cod in the county with Massachusetts' highest vaccination rate - has so far included more than 900 cases. About three-quarters of them were people who were fully vaccinated. Travis Dagenais, who was among the many vaccinated people infected, said "throwing caution to the wind'' and partying in crowds for long nights over the July Fourth holiday was a mistake in hindsight. "The dominant public messaging has been that the vaccine means a return to normal,'' the 35-year-old Boston resident said Thursday. "Unfortunately, I've now learned it's a few steps toward normal, not the zero-to-sixty that we seem to have undertaken.'' Dagenais credits being vaccinated with easing the worst of the flu-like symptoms in a couple of days. He has recovered. Like many states, Massachusetts lifted all Covid-19 restrictions in late May, ahead of the traditional Memorial Day start of the summer season. Provincetown this week reinstated an indoor mask requirement for everyone. Leaked internal documents on breakthrough infections and the delta variant suggest the CDC may be considering other changes in advice on how the nation fights the coronavirus, such as recommending masks for everyone and requiring vaccines for doctors and other health workers. The delta variant, first detected in India, causes infections that are more contagious than the common cold, flu, smallpox and the Ebola virus, and it is as infectious as chickenpox, according to the documents, which mentioned the Provincetown cases. The documents were obtained by The Washington Post. As they note, Covid-19 vaccines are still highly effective against the delta variant at preventing serious illness and death. The Provincetown outbreak and the documents highlight the enormous challenge the CDC faces in encouraging vaccination while acknowledging that breakthrough cases can occur and can be contagious but are uncommon. The documents appear to be talking points for CDC staff to use with the public. One point advised: "Acknowledge the war has changed,'' an apparent reference to deepening concern that many millions of vaccinated people could be a source of wide-ranging spread. An agency spokeswoman declined to comment on the documents. The White House on Friday defended its approach to rising virus cases and shifting public health guidelines, repeatedly deferred to the CDC while stressing the need for vaccinations. "The most important takeaway is actually pretty simple. We need more people to get vaccinated,'' White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said. Pressed about the changing guidance, Jean-Pierre repeatedly said, "We don't make those types of decisions from here.'' People with breakthrough infections make up an increasing portion of hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths among Covid-19 patients, coinciding with the spread of the delta variant, according to the leaked documents. Although experts generally agreed with the CDC's revised indoor masking stance, some said the report on the Provincetown outbreak does not prove that vaccinated people are a significant source of new infections. "There's scientific plausibility for the (CDC) recommendation. But it's not derived from this study,'' said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Johns Hopkins University public health researcher. The CDC report is based on about 470 Covid-19 cases linked to the Provincetown festivities, which included densely packed indoor and outdoor holiday events at bars, restaurants, guest houses, and rental homes. Researchers ran tests on a portion of them and found roughly the same level of virus in those who were fully vaccinated and those who were not. Three-quarters of the infections were in fully vaccinated individuals. Among those fully vaccinated, about 80% experienced symptoms with the most common being cough, headache, sore throat, muscle aches and fever. Dagenais said he started to feel ill the evening he returned home and initially chalked it up to long nights of partying in packed Provincetown nightclubs. But as the days wore on and the fever, chills, muscle aches and fatigue set in, he knew it was something more. In the report, the measure researchers used to assess how much virus an infected person is carrying does not indicate whether they are actually transmitting the virus to other people, said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan. CDC officials say more data is coming. They are tracking breakthrough cases as part of much larger studies that involve following tens of thousands of vaccinated and unvaccinated people across the country over time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/cdc-study-vaccinated-people-can-carry-as-much-virus-as-others/articleshow/84909259.cms||---

Ghaziabad plans to administer around 60,000 doses — three times more than the current coverage. Gautam Budh Nagar, meanwhile, has fixed a target of vaccinating 30,000-40,000 people. State immunisation officer Dr Ajay Ghai said: “In spite of the mega drive, we will try to continue with the same pace on other days in August as well.” Ghai said the targets of the mega drive would be achieved through a cluster approach. Under the cluster approach, Ghaziabad was divided into 54 blocks and 568 clusters for vaccination purposes in July. Altogether 9,176 sessions were planned for July but this could not be implemented fully due to the shortage of vaccines. According to the plan prepared in Noida, health officials will create around 150 session sites across the district. Every site will be given a target to vaccinate 200-250 people. Also, a higher number of online as well as walk-in slots will be available for all sessions. GB Nagar CMO Dr Sunil Sharma said doctors are undergoing training for the drive-in Lucknow on Friday and Saturday. Meanwhile, Ghaziabad administered the highest number of doses – 30,004 — in the state on Thursday. Nodal officer Dr GP Mathuria said as many as 144 sessions were conducted at 74 centres in the district to achieve the target.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/mega-vaccine-drive-across-up-on-aug-3/articleshow/84915523.cms||Snehil Sinha

---||Gurgaon||Stations in Gurugram & Rewari on proposed Delhi-Ahmedabad bullet train corridor||GURUGRAM: A station has been proposed in Manesar on the Delhi-Ahmedabad bullet train corridor that the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) plans to build. The corridor, whose detailed project report has been drawn up, is still in the planning stages and is likely to take shape only in the latter half of the decade. Travel time on this 886km route is expected to be under four hours, with a total of 15 stops under consideration. Rewari is the only other station proposed in Haryana. The proposed route originates at Dwarka Sector 21 in Delhi and crosses into Gurugram at Chauma. It then runs along the Dwarka Expressway till Ramprastha City (Sector 37D) before turning right to align with the Delhi-Jaipur railway line and crossing the KMP Expressway before joining the Delhi-Jaipur highway at Shahjahanpur toll plaza (Haryana-Rajasthan border). NHSRCL officials held consultations in the city on Friday for land for the corridor. An NHSRCL official told TOI, “We have chosen this alignment (along the rail line and highway) to ensure that land acquisition is minimal. In such mega projects, maximum time gets spent in acquiring privately owned land. While the alignment is final, acquiring land is yet to begin. Friday’s consultations with private landowners in Gurugram and Rewari were fruitful and they all agreed to let their land be acquired for construction of the Bullet train, probably sensing the benefits this project would offer once it is ready.” The official added, “We would need around three to four years to acquire the land, shift utilities, get necessary clearances and NOCs for various departments, permission to cut trees and several other such things before we can start construction work on ground. Once that work gets started, we would need about three years to complete the project.” Other than Dwarka and the two Haryana stops, of the 15 stations proposed on the corridor, nine are in Rajasthan and three in Gujarat. Officials said the corridor will be a fully elevated one. At present, it takes about 14 hours by train from Delhi to Ahmedabad. On the Bullet train, it is expected to be under four hours. The 15 stations have been proposed at Dwarka (Delhi), IMT Manesar (Gurugram), Rewari, Behror, Shahpura, Jaipur, Ajmer, Vijaynagar, Bhilwara, Chittorgarh, Udaipur, Dungarpur (all Rajasthan) and Himmatnagar, Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad (Gujarat). Groundwork for another high-speed rail corridor — Delhi-Gurugram-Alwar RRTS (Regional Rapid Transit System) is already under way in the region. “Both the Delhi and Haryana governments have approved this project and a final nod is awaited from the Centre. The preliminary work like soil testing, road widening has started and we are awaiting approval from the ministry of housing and urban affairs,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/stations-in-city-rewari-on-proposed-delhi-ahmedabad-bullet-train-corridor/articleshow/84909722.cms||Joel Joseph

The reason, claim officials, is the death of 30 patients in the past few months. The centre has the capacity to enrol 120 patients and conduct a total of 1,170 dialysis sessions per month. At present, 107 people are enrolled and around 900 sessions are being done. Sources claimed that with over 140 people in the queue, there used to be a waiting period of over two months till last year The number of patients in the dialysis centre has been registering a continuous decline since March this year. According to the official records, the centre was running at 75.5% capacity in March, which declined to 70.68% in April and 68.33% in May. Concerned over the decline in the number of patients availing the facility, the chief medical superintendent of the hospital Dr Sanjay Teotia had last month sought an explanation from the centre’s manager. The reply had some startling facts. The centre manager informed that 30 patients of the dialysis unit had died in the past few months. However, the cause of their deaths was not mentioned. Moreover, due to the lockdown, many patients faced difficulties in reaching the centre, which was functional even during the height of the second wave. Many patients who contracted Covid were referred to Meerut Medical college for dialysis per the state government’s order. “The average number of dialysis conducted per day was around 45 on normal days, but these days about 25-30% fewer sessions are being conducted. We have been trying to publicise the vacancy at the centre, which provides the facility free of cost,” Dr Teotia told TOI. The centre was developed under a PPP model and made functional in February 2018 at the DCH. It is being run by DCDC Pvt Limited, a private company, which has signed an MoU with the state government. While the patient is provided free treatment, the state government pays a fixed amount to the company per session, which costs between Rs 1,200 and Rs 1,400. At present, there are 15 machines in the centre, two of which are reserved for hepatitis patients. .The centre manager has told the hospital management that now efforts are being made by the centre to call more patients for dialysis. Dr RC Gupta, a senior physician at the hospital, said that kidney patients who are undergoing dialysis are in the highest-risk category if they contract Covid infection. Their survival chance is below 1%. Pneumonitis in Covid patients aggravates the situation in dialysis patients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/dialysis-centre-in-gzb-running-below-capacity-30-recent-deaths-to-blame/articleshow/84909916.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Ghaziabad||Man gets life in jail for rape, murder of 5-year-old girl||GHAZIABAD: A special POSCO court on Friday sentenced a 36-year-old man to life imprisonment for the rape and murder of a five-year-old girl in Khoda nearly three year’s ago. Special judge (POCSO) Harshvardhan also imposed a fine of Rs 1.60 lakh on the convict, Deepak Singh, of which Rs 1.25 lakh would be given to the girl’s family as a compensation amount. According to special public prosecutor Utkarsh Vats, a missing’s person complaint was registered against an unidentified person at the Khoda police station on August 3, 2018, a day after the girl went missing. Singh, who ran a tax attached to a cab aggregator, was then living as a tenant in the girl's house. After his arrest on August 7, police told the media that on the evening of July 2, Singh was watching porn in an inebriated state in his room when the girl walked in around 8 pm. He raped the girl and later smothered her to death when she tried to raise an alarm. “Singh kept the girl’s body in a bag near the house’s stairs and later put it on the roof of the adjacent house belonging to her uncle. Next day, he also participated in a search operation launched by her parents to trace her,” Vats said. The body of the girl was found two days later, on the morning of July 4, while the post-mortem was conducted the same night. The forensics team collected some important evidence in the case. The nature of injuries on her nose and lips and other circumstantial evidence hinted at sexual assault on her. On that basis, IPC Section 376 AB (rape of a girl under 12 years of age) and other relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was subsequently added. A total of seven witnesses were examined in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/man-gets-life-in-jail-for-rape-murder-of-5-year-old-girl/articleshow/84909922.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Noida||All residential sectors in Noida to soon have parks for children||NOIDA: Children will soon be able to play outdoor games like cricket, football and volleyball in sector parks. The Noida Authority has decided to develop a park for children in every residential sector to encourage them to play outside. For this, a meeting with the sector RWAs will be held next week and suggestions will be invited, officials said. The horticulture department will develop these parks, which will have a cricket pitch, a basketball court and cycling and walking tracks. In the absence of play areas for children, residents have long been demanding dedicated outdoor play spaces for children, particularly those who are older. “Given the requirement, CEO Ritu Maheshwari has approved the development of one park for each residential sector of the city,” said Indu Prakash, OSD to the Noida Authority. The parks will be developed in coordination with the sector RWAs as they know best the requirements of their sectors. “We will send a letter to all RWAs next week inviting suggestions, including identifying the land or area in their sector, which can be developed into a park for older children. After their response, we will submit the details to the CEO for an approval,” said Prakash. According to officials, the parks will have a central area of grass with plants on the edges, cricket pitch or ground for football, along with walkways and cycle tracks where required. “Even basketball, volleyball or badminton courts can be developed depending on the available space. All such details will be finalised once we collate the list of parks for older children,” the OSD added. While big parks may have more facilities, the aim is to provide a space for older children for their physical growth and activity. And children have lauded the Authority’s initiative. “I welcome this move as soon we are going to get a place of our own in the neighbourhood,” said Mohit Kumar, a resident of Sector 62.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/all-residential-sectors-in-noida-to-soon-have-parks-for-children/articleshow/84909928.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||World||US commuters uneasy as Delta variant threatens return to workplaces||NEW YORK/ATLANTA: The fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus is worrying some US commuters who are already back on crowded buses and subway cars as corporate America attempts a greater return to the workplace after more than a year of pandemic disruption. For New York City resident Bernice Donkor, whose subway commute takes more than one hour each way, it is already hard to snag a seat. "I've been very worried," said the 28-year-old city worker. "I try to protect myself, hand sanitizing, washing my hands the minute we get to the office and, of course, at home." In Atlanta, 69-year-old Scott Monty wore a blue face mask as he waited for the bus earlier this week. He was headed to an office that had recently reopened. "I have hypertension, and I am old, so I need to be careful. So I say a prayer to the Lord," said the semi-retired accountant. "I have a mask and I have God." For a few months earlier this year, the pandemic ebbed as vaccines became widely available and states loosened most restrictions, allowing some aspects of daily life to resume. Infections declined, Covid-19 hospital wards emptied, and some businesses began asking remote employees to head back to the office after working from home for more than a year. With the highly-contagious variant now spurring a rise in US coronavirus cases, a rethink is underway. The White House announced Thursday that people working for the federal government, the largest employer in the United States, will have to show proof of vaccination or wear masks, practice social distancing and get regular tests. Tech giants like Alphabet's Google said this week that all their US employees must get vaccinated to step into offices. But Microsoft's LinkedIn is now allowing most employees to work fully remote. In schools, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently recommended that all students and staff wear masks regardless of vaccination status. PANDEMIC PLUNGEPublic transport ridership had plummeted across US cities during the pandemic. New York subway ridership remains down about 50% during the weekdays, according to the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the largest transit system in the country. The San Francisco-Bay area's BART system had an average of 47,000 weekday riders during the first quarter of 2021, about one-ninth of ridership before the pandemic. But BART ridership has started to rebound - it was more than 88,000 Wednesday, up from about 70,000 two months ago. Covid-19 transmission on public transit is difficult to determine given the mitigation measures such as masking and social distancing put into place early in the pandemic, said Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore. Mass transit systems located in areas with high vaccination rates are best positioned to avoid outbreaks, he added, but "it's inevitable that there's going to be spread and transmission on those cars between unvaccinated individuals." Many subway and bus riders turned to cars and bikes during the pandemic. By October last year, the average daily number of Citi Bike rides taken by New Yorkers rebounded from pandemic lows recorded in April 2020 to levels higher than for the same month in 2019, according to New York City's bike-share program. Sebastian Tordilla, 17, said he can't wait to get his driver's license so he can get off Los Angeles buses. "It’s become very crowded in there, lots of people don't wear masks, there's this new variant, it's very claustrophobic," said the student and part-time restaurant worker. Other commuters, such as Atlanta chef Chris Rabideau, are less concerned. Rabideau, who is fully vaccinated, was reading a dog-eared paperback on a blistering afternoon as he sat on bus bench, awaiting the No 6 to take him to work. "No, Covid and Delta and whatever's next doesn't bother me. I'm just living my life," said a mask-less Rabideau, 46. "If it comes to it, I'll wear masks again, but right now I'm cool."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-commuters-uneasy-as-delta-variant-threatens-return-to-workplaces/articleshow/84910117.cms||---

It also informed the House that 87 children living in childcare institutions have been affected by Covid-19, as per data collected till July 23. In her reply to a query, women and child development minister Smriti Irani said states and Union territories were directed on July 22 to identify children eligible for support under PM Cares and register them on the portal that was launched under the central scheme. The states and UTs were asked to upload details of children who lost their parents to Covid within 15 days. The data till July 29 shows that as many as 18 states and UTs have not yet provided the detials of eligible children. Of the 292 children registered on the portal, Tamil Nadu accounts for 112 and Andhra 85. According to information provided by the states and UTs, 645 children lost their parents to Covid from April 2021 to May 28, Irani said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced the ‘PM Cares for Children’ scheme to support children who have lost both parents or surviving parent or legal guardian or adoptive parents due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The scheme provides support for education and health and will create a corpus of Rs 10 lakh for each child when he or she reaches 18 years of age. This corpus will be used to give a monthly financial support or stipend to the orphaned children when the attain the age of 18 years for the next five years to take care of his or her personal requirements during the period of higher education, and on reaching the age of 23 years, he or she will get the corpus amount in a lump-sum for personal and professional use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/292-kids-who-lost-parents-to-covid-registered-for-pm-cares-assistance/articleshow/84910155.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court seeks report from Jharkhand on judge killing||NEW DELHI: Rising number of attacks on judges and lawyers compelled a worried Supreme Court on Friday to take suo motu cognisance of the alleged killing of Dhanbad additional district judge Uttam Anand and order the Jharkhand chief secretary and the DGP to submit the status of the investigations within a week. Though on Thursday, CJI N V Ramana had talked to Jharkhand HC Chief Justice Ravi Ranjan, leading to the HC ordering probe into the incident, a bench of the CJI and Justice Surya Kant on Friday decided to take up the Jharkhand incident besides those on a pan-India basis, saying attacks on judges and lawyers were reported from across the country. The bench said safety and security of judicial officers and lawyers are of paramount importance for fearless and independent functioning of the justice dispensation system. On Thursday, SC Bar Association president Vikas Singh had mentioned the Dhanbad incident before the CJI and demanded a CBI probe, terming it a “brazen assault” on independence of judiciary. Turning to the Jharkhand incident, the bench said it was taking suo motu cognisance because of the close proximity of the “unfortunate death of the additional district judge” to that of a Ranchi-based lawyer, who was gunned down by miscreants on July 26. However, the SC clarified that the suo motu cognisance of the incident taken by it would not impede the Jharkhand HC’s proceedings relating to the death of the Dhanbad additional district judge. The SC termed the Dhanbad incident “gruesome” and said the circulation of the video clip suggests that “it was not a case of simple road accident”. The bench in its order said, “We direct the Chief Secretary and Director General of Police, state of Jharkhand, to jointly submit a status report of inquiry vis-a-vis the sad demise of the judicial officer Uttam Anand, with the Registry of this curt within a week’s time.” The CJI said the SC is taking suo motu cognisance “taking into account several such incidents in other parts of the country where judicial officers and lawyers are attacked”. The CJI-led bench said, “It has been brought to the notice of this court that similar incidents are happening across the country. Taking into consideration the duty and obligation of the state to create an environment and accord full protection to judicial officers as well as the legal fraternity so that they can perform their duties fearlessly, we deem it appropriate to take up this matter suo motu.” “As there is an urgent need for wider consideration and consequential detailed explanation(s) by all concerned, we will consider the desirability of issuing notice to all other states and Union Territories on the next date of hearing,” it said setting the next date of hearing for August 6. In what could put the Hemant Soren government in a tight spot, the bench asked the Jharkhand chief secretary and the DGP to detail the steps taken to protect judicial officers, judges and the legal fraternity within and outside the court complexes. A quick search of news reports on assault on judges by TOI revealed many such incidents in the recent past. On March 25 in Uttar Pradesh, a group of lawyers, annoyed with the decisions of Unnao additional district judge Prahlad Tandon, had assaulted him. Humiliated in this manner, the judicial officer had tendered his resignation. The state Bar Council had identified eight lawyers associated with the assault. In February, a man had thrown motor oil at the official car of Justice V Shircy of the Kerala High Court blackening the driver-side of the car. In July last year, Chittor magistrate V Ramakrishna had alleged that he was assaulted by ruling YSRCP workers, who were purportedly aides of Andhra Pradesh minister P Ramachandra Reddy. Ramakrishna had alleged that he was assaulted because of his differences with former Judge C V Nagarjuna Reddy, chairperson of AP Electricity Regulatory Commission. In 2018 in Maharashtra, Nagpur senior civil judge K R Deshpande was allegedly slapped by an assistant public prosecutor who was miffed with his decision in a case. In 1994, in the light of increasing frequency of attacks on the independence of judges, lawyers and court officials, the weakening safeguards for judiciary and lawyers and the gravity of frequency of human rights violations, the UN Human Rights Commission had decided to appoint a Special Rapporteur on independence of judges and lawyers. The Special Rapporteur continues to give adverse reports about safety and security of judges and lawyers. In July last year, US District Judge Esther Salas’ son, Daniel Anderl, and husband, defence attorney Mark Anderl, were shot in their New Jersey home in North Brunswick Township. The tragedy forced New Jersey to enact a Daniel’s law, named after Salas’ son, in November last year that makes it a crime to publish personal information of New Jersey judges, prosecutors and law enforcement officers, including their phone numbers and home addresses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-seeks-report-from-jharkhand-on-judge-killing/articleshow/84910204.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Discussions are on to integrate the entire programme with CoWin as it is likely to have almost 80 crore registrations in the next few months after Covid vaccination for children is started. This means that not just Covid inoculations but all vaccinations provided under UIP could be brought on the CoWin platform,” the official told TOI. UIP includes vaccines like BCG, DPT and OPV besides that for Measles and Hepatitis B, among others. The official said with crores of registrations on CoWin, a database of beneficiaries with mobile numbers has been created, which is one way to integrate UIP with CoWin. Experts said citizens currently undergoing vaccination under UIP don’t have access to a digital system through which they can check their vaccination records, with only manual cards being available as vaccination records.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-all-universal-vaccine-programmes-to-be-linked-to-cowin/articleshow/84910227.cms||Neha Madaan

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Krishna Murari and V Ramasubramanian said that there were many similar petitions filed by other petitioners pertaining to Section 45(1) of PMLA for putting limitations for granting bail. Section 45(1) of the Act has two pre-conditions for bail — (i) the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose the bail application; and (ii) the court is satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for believing that the person is not guilty of the offence, and the person is not likely to commit any crime while on bail. But the apex court declared it unconstitutional and the government subsequently brought an amendment in the law which allegedly revived the provision. In the petition filed through advocate Avadh Bihari Kaushik, the former minister contended that the apex court had granted interim protection to other petitioners who challenged the provisions and pleaded for the same relief. “This court in similar matters, especially relating to the determination as to whether the twin limitations on bail under Section 45(1) of PMLA stand revived post the amendment carried out in 2018,” the petition said. “This court in Nikesh Tarachand Shah case categorically held the twin conditions under Section 45(1) of PMLA to be unconstitutional. An amendment thereafter was brought in March 2018 which did not explicitly resurrect or revive the twin conditions. Despite the clear position of law that once a court strikes down a provision the same is erased from the statute book, the Enforcement Directorate has been urging in opposition to bail across the country that such twin conditions have been revived and resurrected,” the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/deshmukh-seeks-shield-from-arrest-by-ed-sc-to-hear-plea/articleshow/84910289.cms||---

This applies only to students of parents who are employees of government, public sector undertakings, professionals and business people who have not suffered any income loss due to the pandemic, Justice D Krishnakumar said. “Those parents who have suffered loss of income during this pandemic shall make an application to the school management, who shall consider their request and collect 75% of the fees,” the court said. The court made it clear that such fees must be collected in six instalments on or before February 1 next year. If any parent seeks further concession for payment of annual fees, they shall make a representation to the school management, who shall consider such representation on a case-to-case basis sympathetically, the judge added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/madras-high-court-caps-school-fees-at-85-of-last-years-charges/articleshow/84910311.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Now, Assam and Mizoram spar over drug menace||AIZAWL: A day after the Himanta Biswa Sarma government ordered that all vehicles entering Assam from Mizoram will be checked for drugs, Mizoram hit back on Friday by alleging that illegal pharmaceutical medicines, as well as heroin that were being “smuggled in” from the bigger northeastern state, were affecting the Mizo youths. On Thursday, Assam home commissioner MS Manivannan had issued an order saying all vehicles from Mizoram would be thoroughly checked at the entry points on Assam-Mizoram border and that these vehicles would be released only after due satisfaction of an officer not below the rank of a sub-inspector of Assam Police to ensure that no drugs were smuggled into Assam. On Friday, Mizoram’s commissioner of excise and narcotics department Ngurchungnunga Sailo retaliated by blaming Assam for the drug menace. “Bagha and Lailapur villages in Cachar district on the Assam-Mizoram border are safe haven for drug peddlers and addicts,” Sailo said. He alleged that heroin packs bearing a popular name, ‘Bagha pack’, were being smuggled into Mizoram from the Cachar and widely used by Mizo youths. The commissioner said apart from heroin, illegal pharmaceutical medicines were also being smuggled into Mizoram from Assam. He pointed out that of the 1,680 drug-related deaths in Mizoram since 1984 till date, 1,161 deaths were due to abuse of clinical drugs — spasmo proxyvon/parvon spas — which is 69.11% of the total drug-related deaths. He alleged that all the spasmo proxyvon/parvon spas (Dextroproproxyphene HCL) smuggled into Mizoram came from Assam since 1990 when the first four drug-related deaths due to prominent painkillers were identified. Besides the 1,161 deaths in Mizoram due to spasmo prxyvon/parvon spas abuse, another 213 people have died due to heroin and 277 due to abuse of other pharmaceutical drugs, he said. Mizoram’s information and public relations minister Lalruatkima dismissed a media report quoting senior Assam officials that state ministers were involved in the drug and narcotics trade. “If any minister is found to be involved in such activities, the opposition and the people would have crucified him,” Lalruatkima said. A home department official said the drug menace in Mizoram had been a serious headache for the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/now-assam-mizoram-spar-over-drug-menace/articleshow/84910328.cms||HC Vanlalruata

The decision to deploy the special team comes in the wake of the killing of six Assam policemen at Lailapur near the border on Monday. An official of Cachar district administration on Friday said CRPF IG Sarabjit Singh visited Lailapur on Thursday and took stock of the situation. He held a meeting with police officials of Assam and Mizoram and communicated the Centre’s directives to them, a source said. So far, 13 companies of CRPF jawans — seven of the 147 battalion, two of 119 battalion and one each of the 156, 10, 219 and 28 battalions — have been assigned for duty on the Assam side along the border. Similarly, three companies — one of 140 battalion and two of 225 battalion — have been assigned for deployment on the Mizoram side. Mizoram and Assam share a 164.6-km-long border. Several rounds of dialogue involving the Centre have been held since 1995 to resolve the dispute, but it has flared up every now and then. Meanwhile, Assam police on Friday stopped a team of Asom Jatiya Parishad led by president Lurinjyoti Gogoi from visiting the border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/crpf-commandos-from-kashmir-to-be-put-on-assam-mizoram-border/articleshow/84910364.cms||BB Goswami

It is widely acknowledged that, excluding Tripura and Manipur, all other states have a boundary dispute with Assam,” Pala wrote in his letter. He said this has also given rise to disputes over land, forest resources and ethnic clashes and can be seen in relations of Assam with Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland and Meghalaya. “It has been observed that for reasons best known to the present BJP-led government of Assam, such conflicts have not only been on the rise but have also taken a much more aggressive turn. Consequently, a sense of fear, insecurity and alarm is perceived among the residents of these border areas,” he wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ne-border-disputes-taking-more-aggressive-turn-lately-congress-mp/articleshow/84910387.cms||Manosh Das

ADJ (Pocso court) Mohammad Ahmad was returning to Fatehpur, where he is posted, from Prayagraj when the incident happened. In his complaint, Ahmad said that a litigant had recently threatened him with dire consequences for rejecting his bail plea, adding that the collision could have been a result of that. Preliminary probes revealed that it was an accident and that the SUV owner and the ADJ were not known to each other. Inspector general of Prayagraj range KP Singh, who is monitoring the probe, told TOI that there is “nothing that can suggest the incident was more than an accident”. The incident is being treated with seriousness in light of the apex court taking suo motu cognisance of Dhanbad case, in which a judge was killed after being hit by an autorickshaw while he was out on a morning walk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/up-judge-claims-foul-play-after-his-car-is-hit-by-suv/articleshow/84910480.cms||Kapil Dixit

The self-proclaimed Hindu nationalist, who has written books on PM Narendra Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath, had been wrongly listed among 1,000-odd people allegedly converted by two Delhi-based preachers. While he marches to prove he never did, his quest is being closely followed by UP cops who want him to turn back. They are tracking his phone, cutting him off his path and “counselling” him to give up, he said. Read AlsoHindu man marching 200km on foot to SC to prove he hasn’t convertedPhD scholar Praveen Kumar, whose name figured on a list of thousand people allegedly converted to Islam by two Delhi-based Muslim clerics but who was later given a clean chit by the Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS), is now walking all the way to the Supreme Court in Delhi from his village in UP’s“Why can’t I make my voice heard?” Kumar, 32, said on Friday. “I want to get rid of this stigma I have been unfairly burdened with. Only the SC can help me.”He had left home on what he calls the ‘Samajik Nyay Yatra (Social Justice March)’ on Tuesday after facing a social boycott in his village, where the idea that he may have embraced Islam wasn’t welcomed. While the ATS later acknowledged he had not been converted, he was still seen with suspicion. “Go to Pakistan,” a message on his door said.  On Thursday, he had stopped at a relative’s house in Dadri on Muzaffarnagar-Meerut border. Early Friday morning, he was greeted by cops. “A police team from Saharanpur had tracked my phone’s GPS location,” he said. “They found me and, at first, tried to make me give up on my march. When I didn’t listen, they started pressuring me. They would have detained me and forced me to go back.” In the melee that surrounded this, he managed to give police the slip. “But I had to leave my bag with all my belongings behind.” “We’ve been trying to counsel him but we are not forcing him,” Saharanpur SSP S Chanappa said. Kumar was not convinced.“What came of that one visit? I was labelled a terrorist.

It passed the order on Wednesday after hearing a PIL challenging the government’s July 17 order. During the hearing, the government objected to the maintainability of the PIL and submitted that no interim order be passed.

The inhumane and disturbing incident reportedly happened in Lingapalem area of West Godavari district in the last few days. Sri Latha Challapalli, treasurer of Challapalli charitable trust which fights for animal issues, alleged that the village panchayat officials decided to kill the animals with the help of Dekkala community. “The killings have been happening since July 24. A local panchayat worker has been tasked by higher officials to kill the stray dogs instead of sterilising them scientifically as per government guidelines,” she told TOI. Sri Latha further said that she visited a burial site of the killed strays near a pond where an excavator was used to dig and bury the carcasses, after which she filed a complaint at Dharmajigudem police station. Cops said they have received the complaint and have registered a case under section 429 r/w 34 IPC (mischief by killing or poisoning any animal) and relevant sections of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. Police said they would conduct an autopsy of the carcasses to ascertain the cause of their deaths.

Coming out strongly in support of Sawant’s statement that the parents should be held responsible and why the girls had gone out late at night, Gaude said: “When such incidents happen, it is the parents who suffer the most. The problem is if you post a cop after every girl, imagine how many policemen will we require? The government is not running away from its responsibility, it is there with the people.” On Wednesday, while briefing the assembly about the progress of made in the investigation in about Sawant had said “When 14-year-olds stay on the beach the whole night, the parents need to introspect. Just because children don’t listen, we cannot put the responsibility on the government and police.” Defending his chief minister, Gaude had said: “The CM has made his stand clear, and being a parent, he said the parents should know where their children are, especially if they are minors. If they have taken permission before going out and whether they are staying at somebody's place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cant-post-a-cop-for-every-girl-goa-minister/articleshow/84910547.cms||---

Gadling, an advocate, had challenged a September 2020 rejection of the NIA court. But the NIA had said much time has passed hence the trial court’s order cannot be disturbed now, and also cited the charges to argue Gadling faces a serious case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Gadling's senior counsel Indira Jaising had also pleaded on “humanitarian grounds’’ for three weeks’ interim bail before a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar. The NIA, which is prosecuting 15 accused in the Elgar Parishad case having charged them for being alleged Maoists, opposed his plea. Its counsel Sandesh Patil had on Monday said there were an adequate number of family members who can carry out the last rites and said the scope of the legal provisions cannot be expanded in an appeal as it was not a plea under Article 226 to invoke extraordinary jurisdiction of the HC. Apart from that, Patil said the case against Gadling was serious. Gadling was arrested on June 6, 2018, and has not been granted bail since. The NIA’s case is that on December 31, 2017, Elgar Parishad at Shaniwarwada in Pune, was funded by the banned CPI (M) as part of a conspiracy to create unrest and provocative speeches promoted enmity between various caste groups. This, they said, led to the January 1, 2018, clashes at Koregaon Bhima.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/elgar-parishad-case-surendra-gadling-gets-bail-for-moms-last-rites/articleshow/84910588.cms||Swati Deshpande

Having gone through the painful experience, Bharat knew the importance of organ donation as he himself approached NGO Donate Life. “We understand the pain of patients suffering from organ failure. Therefore, we decided to donate all the vital organs of my wife,” Bharat Dhariya said. In death, Deepika gave a new lease of life to three patients by donating her liver and two corneas. According to sources, deceased fell unconscious after complaining of breathlessness on July 25. She was rushed to Kiran Hospital but the complications grew further and her heart stopped functioning. The doctors, through CPR managed to bring back her heartbeats. Subsequent CT scans revealed that blood was not being properly circulated to her brain. On Thursday, the doctors declared her brain-dead. Her husband then contacted Donate Life founder member Nilesh Mandlewala and expressed his willingness to donate his wife’s organs. “She had been suffering from renal problems and was on constant dialysis for the past two years.,” Bharat, who is in textile business in Surat, said. After receiving consent from the patient’s family, Mandlewala contacted State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO) convener Dr Pranjal Modi in Ahmedabad for further process. “Her liver was transplanted into a 50-year-old man from Surat at the Institute of Kidney Diseases and Research Centre (IKDRC) in Ahmedabad and her two corneas were donated to Lok Drishti Eye bank in Surat,” Mandlewala said.

With very little scope of authentic information on digital platforms, teachers and parents are initiating steps to save children from being misinformed at a tender age. Seema Singh, principal of St Karen’s High School, Gola Road, said they have already devised ways to protect children from misinformation. “We have added a project, ‘school cinema’, in our curriculum. It helps students watch educational videos having topics dealing with fake news. Our students have been responsive. They have benefitted from this initiative,” she said. Joel D’Cruz, assistant professor at a college in Digha, said lessons on news consumption should be taught to students. “In our college, we conduct special foundation and mentoring classes where we generally deal with what’s right and what’s wrong,” he added. Seema Srivastava, mother of a Class IX student, said the control lies on the guardians’ side. “We need to be friendly and communicative with our children so that they come up with their questions and seek clarification. Conversation is the key,” she added. Ehsan Azam, a Class XII passout, said he believes in cross-checking information on internet before believing them. “Neither my school nor college ever told me anything about fake news authentication. However, people have become sensitive these days. As there is so much to consume on internet, I always check other resources if I find something intimidating or boiling,” Azam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/digital-misinformation-harmful-for-schoolchildren-conversation-is-key/articleshow/84902166.cms||---

RCP was recently made a Union cabinet minister. Sources said Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, who reached Delhi on Friday for the meeting, has given enough hints to the senior leaders for “electing” a new party president. JD(U) leader in the LoK Sabha and Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh and the party parliamentary board chairman and former Union minister, Upendra Kushwaha, are the frontrunners for the party’s top post, in case RCP steps down. Name of former Bihar unit president and Rajya Sabha member Bashishtha Narain Singh, a trusted man of Nitish, is also doing the rounds as one of the probables for the JD(U)’s top post. Sources said Bashishtha might be made working national president and asked to lead the party till a new president is formally elected at the next national council meeting. An official statement of the JD(U) said organizational issues, membership drive, current political issues and forthcoming assembly elections in different states were the main items on the agenda for the meeting. Asked about the agenda, Kushwaha said, “The national executive meeting is usually held once a year. This year’s meeting has so far not been held. Hence this meeting has been called.” To a question, Kushwaha said, “When top leaders (of the party) sit together, any other issue can also come up for discussion. But what will be the other issues is difficult to say.” When contacted, JD(U) national general secretary Afaque Ahmad Khan told TOI on Friday that around 75 members of the national executive, including all MPs, state presidents and national office-bearers, have been formally invited to attend the meeting. RCP, who was chosen the party president on December 27 last year, is under pressure to quit the post, keeping in view the party’s principle of ‘one man-one post’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rcp-may-quit-party-chief-post-at-jdu-natl-executive-meet-today/articleshow/84902181.cms||Madan Kumar

Miffed, Sahani left for New Delhi on Thursday evening to meet Union home minister Amit Shah. However, his appointment with Shah had not been confirmed till Friday evening. On Saturday, BJP Rajya Sabha MP Satish Chandra Dubey slammed Sahani for his outburst against Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath who did not allow him to take part in a programme in Varanasi in memory of Phulan Devi. Dubey said Sahani’s party has no support base in Uttar Pradesh, yet he was eager to contest the state assembly polls in the state next year. “When Sahani is not able to control even his party’s four MLAs, how can he excel in the assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh?,” Dubey asked. He said there were several leaders from Sahani’s caste in Uttar Pradesh who are closely associated with the people of that community. VIP’s national spokesperson Dev Jyoti said the party chief is currently in Delhi to hold parleys with senior BJP leaders, including Shah, over recent political developments in Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-mp-slams-sahani-for-outburst-against-up-cm/articleshow/84901722.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Satisfied with results, toppers eye big colleges||PATNA: Notwithstanding disruption in studies due to Covid pandemic, Anuska Roy, a student of Notre Dame Academy, has emerged topper of her school by securing 99% marks in arts stream. She scored 99 marks each in English, history, political science, sociology and economics. Elated with her marks, Anuska said, “I was expecting something along the same line. Even if there had been an exam, I would have got somewhere around the same percentage. During the Covid wave, teachers had made it sure that our studies are not derailed. Our online classes and weekly tests continued.” Born to government employee Manoj Kumar Roy and homemaker Anita Roy, Anuska wants to pursue her graduation in political science from Delhi University or any other university in Kolkata. “I am trying my best to secure admission in any good college in Delhi or Kolkata,” she said. Abhinav Kumar, who has also scored 99% in science stream from St Karen’s High School, was satisfied with his result. “I have scored what I had expected. We knew that the exams would not happen due to the pandemic. The policy of giving marks to students based on their previous performances was the best and the only way under the prevailing situation,” he said. The boy has scored 99 marks in all subjects – mathematics, physics, chemistry, English and informatics practices. “My focus now is on clearing JEE (Advanced) and get admission in computer science and engineering in one of top three IITs of the country. I had cleared my JEE Main with 99.94 percentile. My rank in the state was second,” Abhinav said. Arpit Raj of St Michael’s High School, who has scored 98% in commerce stream, was not much satisfied with his result and said he could have scored better had the exams been held. “It was my dream to get admission in Sri Ram College of Commerce, Delhi. However, it is not possible now as the institute’s cut off is 99%. Many students of CISCE have scored 99% and they will easily get admission there. However, I have qualified the entrance exam of IIM-Indore. The interview will be held soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/satisfied-with-results-toppers-eye-big-colleges/articleshow/84903838.cms||---

---||Patna||Ravaged by Covid pandemic, this poor woman pins hopes on Nitish||PATNA: Covid pandemic has turned the lives of many people, especially the poor, upside down in the city. The unexpected miseries of these people refuse to end even though the government has come up with several measures for their welfare. For instance, 40-year-old Sanju Devi had no other option but to shift to a small rented room (hardly 4x4 feet in size) with tin shed at Ashram Gali along Rajiv Nagar sewer line. Whenever it rains, water leaks from the ceiling, much to her discomfort. Sanju’s husband Kokal Choudhary had abandoned her in 1994. The woman, who is partially blind, raised her daughter on her own and somehow managed to marry her off by spending around Rs 40,000 in 2016. Sanju said after her first husband abandoned her, she got married to one Kariman Choudhary of Ara in 1996. Choudhary, however, died due to electrocution a year after marrying Sanju. “He was a good man. Had he been alive, my life would have been easy. I still put on vermilion and do makeup as I have to visit houses for performing daily chores. People don’t want to see a widow’s face early in the morning,” Sanju said. Born in Patna, she was brought up by her mother Sugiya Devi in a hut alongside Ashiana-Digha road. As per Sanju, she was hardly six-year-old when her brother, Ramesh Kumar, died at the age of 20 after developing sudden stomach pain and headache. “My father, Laxmi Choudhary, left us three months after Ramesh’s death and mother died in 2000,” she said. A beleaguered Sanju now wants to meet CM Nitish Kumar as she believes only he can put an end to her miseries and help her get a house under any government scheme. Sanju used to work as a maid in four houses and earn around Rs 5,000 per month before the pandemic. She now works in only one house and earns just Rs 1,200 per month. “I have to pay a monthly rent of Rs 2,000. The landlord has said he would soon increase the rent amount to Rs 2,400. How can I pay such a large amount when I earn just Rs 1,200 per month?” Sanju asked. Sanju had lived in a rented accommodation at A G Colony for 15 years. After the imposition of Covid-induced lockdown in March last year, her earnings dwindled and she vacated the house in February this year. “The only relief was that my former landlord spared me from paying rent for one year,” she said. She also thanked councillor of ward number 5, Deepa Rani Khan, who had helped her in getting a ration card last year. “I have been able to collect ration only thrice. The PDS dealer refuses to give ration if I fail to reach his shop on time,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ravaged-by-covid-pandemic-this-poor-woman-pins-hopes-on-nitish/articleshow/84902294.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Chai Waale has bagged funding worth Rs 5 crore from marquee angel investors — both existing and new — in this round of fundraising. Besides the leading actor, it has an illustrious list of angel investors include Sunil Sethia, Sunil Kumar Singhvi, Manish Mardia, UNI-M Network, a Mumbai-based angel network and director Vignesh Shivan. “About 80% of the current funding will be utilised in physical store expansion. We aim to have 35 fully functioning stores by the next year,” its founder Vidur Maheswari said. Additionally, private organisations such as Unlisted Kart LLP (online trading platform of unlisted shares) from Bengaluru and Conscience Multi Family office based out of Chennai among other investors are playing a major role in this round of funding. The home-grown QSR brand is planning to set shop in places with high footfalls including metro stations and malls. At the same time, it is leaning towards fulfilling the tea and snack needs of the entire family. Chai Waale has recently added soups, momos and an additional range of sandwiches to its menu. Additionally, new flavours of ice-tea, desserts and some quick items are in the pipeline. "Since the first lockdown, we have adopted stringent hygiene processes and safety measures that gave us the confidence about serving our customers safely through online channels. During the unlock phases, we increased our digital marketing and ecommerce budgets to acquire a new customer base online apart from our existing loyal customer base,” added Maheswari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/actor-nayanthara-invests-in-chai-waale/articleshow/84905581.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Business||Banks’ jewellery, auto auctions to rise||MUMBAI: The second quarter of the current fiscal could see a surge in an auction of retail assets by lenders, particularly jewellery and cars offered as collateral for loans. Although there has been an increase in retail delinquencies in the first quarter, lenders have not seized or auctioned assets because of the pandemic. With the economy now opening up, recovery action is likely to pick up. “We did postpone quite a bit of normal collection activity. This includes auctions that we might have done of collaterals that we normally can quickly do and collect. We have not done any asset sales or any restructuring in the last quarter,” said HDB Financial Services MD & CEO G Ramesh in an analyst call for HDFC Bank. He added that there has been an improvement since the end of June and early July as customers like to come back on track. “In the jewel loan portfolio, if the loan goes overdue, you send auction notices to customers. In the current environment, we have not done that in April and May and a large part of June as well,” said ICICI Bank chief finance officer Rakesh Jha in an analyst call. He added that the bank has now started doing that in July and has already started to see recoveries from these portfolios. According to RBI data, loans against jewellery by banks stood at Rs 62,221 crore as of June 18, 2021 — an 80% increase over the previous year. Even in the first quarter, loans grew 2.5% despite the second wave. Auto loans had shown a jump of 11% year-on-year at Rs 2,38,214 crore. Last week, another private lender Bajaj Finance said that there was an increase in auto loan delinquencies due to defaults in its three-wheeler loan portfolio. The company’s MD Rajeev Jain said that since the assets were repossessable, the lender might see better recoveries. Fitch Ratings said the second wave of Covid will continue to exert near-term pressure on non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). “Non-performing loans (NPLs) are likely to rise, as renewed activity restrictions have impaired borrower repayment capacity. Collection shortfalls are better than a year ago, but remain significant — 5-40% across various lending segments in April and May 2021,” the rating agency said. Bankers said that while the pandemic impact has been severe, there have not been many defaults in the corporate segment. The SME segment was protected because of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), which had a one-year moratorium that ends in the second quarter. As a result, most of the defaults were being seen in the retail segment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-jewellery-auto-auctions-to-rise/articleshow/84906408.cms||Mayur Shetty

Assets under management as at end of June 2021, grew by 7% at Rs 75,763 crore as compared to Rs 70,826 crore as at end of June 2020. The NBFC has set aside overlay provisions of Rs 750 crore as on December 2020 and created additional overlay provisions in March, 2021 to the tune of Rs 350 crore to support possible uncertainties that could arise due to the second wave, taking the total management overlay to Rs 1,100 crore. Of this, management overlay of Rs 400 crore was reversed during the quarter ended June 2021. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of the company as on June 30 2021, was at 19.08% as against the regulatory requirement of 15%. Tier-I Capital was at 16.60%. Many of the borrowers and the staff of CIFCL were impacted by the pandemic in the 2nd wave, whereby the priority shifted from business to protecting the wellbeing of the affected persons. This resulted in a setback in performance in Q1 on the disbursements and collections front, said a statement from the bank. Total restructuring stood at 5.44% of the book.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/chola-investment-finance-q1-net-profit-down-25-at-rs-327cr/articleshow/84905528.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Two decomposed bodies found in Tadepalli shed||VIJAYAWADA: Two highly decomposed bodies of a man and a woman were found under suspicious circumstances in a shed at Tadepalli in Guntur district on Friday. Tadepalle police said locals complained to the local village revenue officer about a foul smell emanating from a metal shed near the old ESI hospital at Undavalli junction. Upon receiving information from the VRO, cops reached the spot and broke open the door to find the two corpses lying on the bed. As per preliminary investigation, the bodies may have been lying there for at least a week. Cops said they found hundreds of CDs, a VCR, a tab, several mobile phones without SIM cards and astrology books inside cupboards in the shed. But they could not find any information about the identity or other details of the deceased. The owner of the shed told police that the couple was living in the premises for the past 10 years and he barely interacted with them as the rental agreement was sorted through a mediator. The electricity bills and tax documents were in the name of one Shiva Rao, who could not be reached when police tried to contact him. Though the cause of death is yet to be ascertained, cops suspect it could be a suicide pact. A case under section 174 of CrPC (suspicious death) has been registered based on the VRO’s complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/two-decomposed-bodies-found-in-tadepalli-shed/articleshow/84904411.cms||---

Concluding the discussion on the issue, home minister Satyendar Jain stated that the claims that the income of farmers would double was nothing but “jumla”. “The agri laws have been made to benefit some big companies and farmers will turn into labourers from being landowners. The Centre should withdraw these farm laws without any conditions,” he added. AAP MLA Virender Singh Kadian moved the motion underlining that the House had noted with concern that the Centre had not heeded the demands of farmers for withdrawal of the three Acts despite their peaceful protests. The motion stated, “Keeping in view the genuine demand of the farmers and also the fact that many of them have lost their lives during the struggle, this House strongly recommends that the Union government immediately repeal the three agri laws and call the farmers’ associations for talks to understand their grievances.” Jarnail Singh, another AAP MLA, said the farmers were suffering in their fight. “They consider land their mother and can go to any extent to protect it. Around 600 farmers have died, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who usually speaks even on small issues, hasn’t uttered a single word on this,” he added, while appealing to the Centre to talk to the farmers and repeal the three Acts. Leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said the AAP government had already notified the farm reform laws for implementation in Delhi, but was now raising questions on it. “The farm laws will increase production, double farmers’ income and mandis will be expanded,” he added. “Delhi government had promised that it would give 50% more price than the MSP announced by the central government. It had also talked about increasing land acquisition compensation from Rs 53 lakh per acre to Rs 1 crore. It had also declared to make electricity free for running tubewells. But none of the promises were fulfilled,” said Bidhuri. Demanding subsidy on tractors and extending subsidy on fertilisers, Bidhuri said gram sabha land should only be used for creating facilities for locals, including schools, hospitals, and colleges. “All schemes announced by the PM for the welfare of farmers should be implemented in Delhi,” said Bidhuri, while claiming that after Modi became PM the income of farmers had doubled and production increased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/farmers-agitation-echoes-in-assembly-with-a-strong-demand-to-withdraw-three-laws/articleshow/84907567.cms||AlokKNMishra

It has also raised the issue of security of all judges across the country in the backdrop of Anand’s murder. Anand was on a morning walk when he was rammed by an autorickshaw in Dhanbad on Wednesday. The CCTV footage of the incident has gone viral on social media platforms. BJSA secretary-cum-additional district and sessions judge Ajit Kumar Singh has addressed the letter to the national body’s general secretary Dr Ajay Nathani. In the letter written on Thursday, the BJSA has termed Anand’s killing as shocking and a “cold-blooded murder”. The association said it was earlier presumed to be a case road accident, but the CCTV footage showed that the autorickshaw slowed down before running over Anand. “The matter involves security of judges across the country. It should not be taken lightly,” the letter read. The association has urged the national body to take up the matter at the highest level and bring it to a logical conclusion. “All judicial officers of Bihar are shocked and dismayed over the incident.

Pandey said that no financial aid was given to the kin of deceased teachers. “Even though the department had got the list of such teachers, no monetary help was given to their family memnbers,” the CPI MLC said. However, Choudhary replied that the list of Covid deaths was prepared after a review by a committee headed by the district magistrate. This committee sends a recommendation to the health department which in turn sends a recommendation to the disaster management department which sanctions an ex gratia of Rs four lakh. JD(U) MLC Ghulam Rasool raised the issue of cancellation of affiliation to Zakir Hussain Uchh Vidyalaya, Patna. Rasool through a call attention said the school had been imparting education to a large number of students and has its own infrastructure and several examinations were held here. It was given recognition in 1983 as non-government minority school. Rasool further said the director BSEB had first put the affiliation on hold and later cancelled it. He made an appeal to the government to immediately look into the issue. The education minister, however, said the department has no paper related to the recognition given to the school. He said the school should submit the paper, if they have any. He further said, “In a report submitted to the BSEB, it was found that the school does not have its own land and a clerk was made the principal without having required eligibility.” However, several MLCs made a request to the education minister to personally look into the matter as it is an old school and the chief minister, his deputy and legislators had given aid to it. Monsoon session concludes: The monsoon session of Bihar Vidhan Parishad concluded on Friday. Acting chairperson Awadhesh Narain Singh expressed his gratitude toward all the members for carrying out their duties diligently and participating in the functioning of the House. All the members stood in silence for a minute and prayed for those who lost their lives in the tragic bus accident at Barabanki. In the five-day session, 183 questions were given by the MLCs for listing, of which 160 were listed and 75 were answered. Similarly, listing for 38 call attention motions were raised, of which 20 were listed and answered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/693-teachers-died-of-covid-says-edu-minister-in-council/articleshow/84902506.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Fraud tantrik evades prosecution for 22 years||VADODARA: Two Barodians caught hold of a fraud tantrik, Babulal Gor, who allegedly duped people in the name of conducting rituals in Vadodara in 1999. Praveen Koradia and Dhiru Mistry hoped that Gor’s indictment will serve as a lesson for other cheats. But their wait for justice has turned 22 years and counting as the trial for the case is yet to begin! Reason? Police are yet to ‘trace’ out Gor and produce the accused before the court. On Friday, 70-year-old Koradia and 82-year-old Mistry were summoned by the court for the second time in connection with the case. “In 2019, we got the summons for the first time, 20 years after the complaint was filed! We got to learn in the court that cops haven’t been able to trace Gor, who stays in Ahmedabad, as yet. The judge had then directed Ahmedabad police commissioner to produce the accused before the court,” Mistry said. “We again appeared in the court on Friday but the accused wasn’t present. The judge again directed the Ahmedabad police to trace Gor and produce him in the court in the next hearing in September this year,” Mistry, a national award-winning documentary film-maker and social activist, said. “Since 1999, I changed my residence thrice after I filed a complaint against Gor at the J P Road police station. The cops managed to trace me and serve summons, but ironically they have been unsuccessful in tracking down Gor in all these years! I hope they are able to produce him before the court in the next hearing,” Koradia, who had trapped and caught hold of the accused, said. “In 1999, an advertisement in a local newspaper drew my attention. Gor had given an advertisement promising to solve people’s problems. He was staying in a hotel in Vadodara and so I approached him as a customer. I told Gor that I wanted to buy a lottery ticket to win a fortune,” Koradia recalled. “Gor told me that he will help me win the lottery and demanded Rs 1,500 for conducting a ritual. We had brought cops along who nabbed him and took him to J P Road police station,” Koradia, who campaigns against superstitions, said. “After filing FIR, Koradia was allowed to leave the police station and he has been missing since then. We will continue to pursue the case even if it takes many more years,” Mistry said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/fraud-tantrik-evades-prosecution-for-22-years/articleshow/84904538.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Business||Shareholders raise queries on TaMo dividend||MUMBAI: Tata Motors shareholders have questioned the company’s leadership on goals for dividend payments, even as they lauded the management’s commitment to make the company debt-free by fiscal 2024. The flagship of India’s largest conglomerate, the Tata Group, hasn’t paid dividends to shareholders for the last five fiscals. At Tata Motors’s 76th AGM on Friday, shareholder Hiranand Kotwani asked when the company would pay dividends. “Though it is heartening to know that the company is sticking to its target of bringing the automotive debt to zero by fiscal 2024, are we going to get dividends then?” Kotwani asked. Another shareholder, Smita Shah, remarked that “the company’s share price is doing good, but please think about dividends too”. Long-time shareholder Adil Irani said, “I do mind if I don’t get a dividend.” Responding to the shareholders, Tata Motors chairman N Chandrasekaran said, “We understand your concerns about dividend. We too have that concern. We want to make Tata Motors a dividend-paying company.” Companies pay dividends out of profits or from reserves of accumulated profits. To pay dividends from the reserves of accumulated profits, shareholders’ approval is required. Tata Motors was in the red for the last three fiscals. At last year’s shareholder meeting, Tata Motors had declared that it would become debt-free by fiscal 2024. Though Tata Motors has managed to reduce the net automotive debt by Rs 7,300 crore to Rs 40,900 crore in fiscal 2021, its financial obligations shot up to Rs 61,300 crore by June-end. But the management is confident of reducing the debt as it expects improved cash flows from the business. “As the impact of the pandemic recedes with more people getting vaccinated, we expect demand to remain strong with consumer preference shifting towards personal mobility,” the chairman informed shareholders. “The supply situation, however, is expected to be adversely impacted for the next few months due to disruptions from Covid lockdowns in India and semiconductor shortage worldwide,” Chandrasekaran said, adding that this will impact production volumes, sales and margins in the near term. “We expect the situation to improve in the second half of fiscal 2022.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/shareholders-raise-queries-on-tamo-dividend/articleshow/84906722.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The HC was hearing a PIL filed by advocate Siddharth Chandrashekhar to streamline the vaccination process, making Cowin app act in a citizen-friendly manner. His counsel Anita Castellino had earlier pointed to news reports of camps held by housing societies where fake vaccine shots were given to many. Senior counsel Anil Sakhare, for the BMC, said it has proposed to vaccinate all 2,773 victims, once they de-register and can register again on Cowin. The HC said, “Appropriate authority at the highest level of the Central Government should look into the proposed action plan and to approve...within seven days.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fake-covid-vax-hc-gives-centre-1-week-to-decide-in-mumbai/articleshow/84910363.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Kolkata||Fuel rates constant in Kolkata, but revision hope low||KOLKATA: Following 42 hikes in around two months, petrol price in the city has remained unchanged at Rs 102.14 for two weeks. Diesel price, too, has been stagnant at Rs 93.08 during the same period, providing some relief to motorists. Petrol had touched a fresh high on July 17, when it rose by 6 paise per litre in the state capital. It breached the Rs 100 mark at all fuel stations across Kolkata on July 7, 48 hours after it had touched the three-digit mark at two fuel pumps, for the first time in the city’s history. However, since July 17, the price has remained constant. In fact, this is the first time it has remained stagnant for such a long spell since the period between April 15 and May 3, when it stayed stuck at Rs 90.6 “I fear it may be the calm before a storm. The rate at which the fuel price has increased in the last two months, I’m worried it may go for another steep climb towards the Rs 110 mark soon. In any case, the rising price has made me lessen use of my car — I now take it out only for emergencies or very important work,” said Supriyo Dasgupta from Salt Lake. The stagnation in fuel price, not only in the city but across the nation, may be attributed to the global developments in oil production and rising US inventories, which softened crude and product rates. The oil marketing companies, however, are yet to decide on reducing the retail price of petrol and diesel, claiming time is needed to study the price movement. A source in an oil PSU hinted chance of a reduction in fuel price is slim courtesy a sudden rise in international oil prices last week. Benchmark Brent crude oil is currently retailing at over $75 per barrel after it had fallen significantly a week ago. “There is no point being content with a stagnation in fuel price when the rate is above Rs 100. Sales have come down across fuel stations anyway,” said Snehasis Bhowmick, vice-president of West Bengal Petroleum Dealers’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fuel-rates-constant-but-revision-hope-low/articleshow/84906973.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

However, the blood bank was allowed to give blood to the needy from its available stock. The IMA blood bank at Chetganj was raided by the officials of the drug department after a man was arrested with three units of blood in Baburi area of Chandauli district on July 27. The arrested person Bhola informed the police that he had purchased the blood units from an employee Anand of IMA blood bank in Varanasi at the rate of Rs 2,000 per unit to sell it to the nursing homes in Chandauli. After his revelation, the assistant drug controller Vinay Gupta and drug inspector Saurabh Dubey conducted a raid at the IMA blood bank. The drug inspector said that since the recovered blood bags belong to the IMA blood banks, the records are being examined. In the meantime, the blood donation at the bank has been restricted till the further order, he said adding that the blood bank can give blood from its available stock. “It is unfortunate that we have to stop the services of the blood bank due to the drastic step taken by the drug department that restricted blood donation for the patients,” the IMA president Dr Manisha Singh told TOI, adding, “We have informed the drug department and the district administration about our decision, and we are waiting for their response”. According to her, the blood bank still has the blood bags of the same numbers, which were recovered from the arrested person. It is a matter of investigation how the blood bags of the same numbers were in possession with the arrested person. “We give blood only to those hospitals and nursing homes, which have inked MoU with the IMA,” she said. “We are fully cooperating in the investigation, as everything is well recorded in the bank,” she said, adding that the IMA had already terminated Anand, whose name came to light in this episode, on July 16 for his suspicious activities. “How the blood bank will function without getting blood through donation,” she wondered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ima-blood-bank-services-stopped-after-restrictions-on-blood-donation/articleshow/84904403.cms||---

The government has given administrative sanction to organize LKS-3 for 2021-22 at a cost of Rs 1 crore. A cultural fete titled All Kerala cultural festival related with the third edition has also received administrative sanction at Rs 50 lakh. The chief executive officer, Norka Roots, had submitted a detailed proposal for the implementation of the Loka Kerala Sabha-3. The department working group meeting held on July 12 considered the proposal and recommended that administrative sanction may be accorded for the proposal subject to the guidelines of finance department. Administrative sanction has been given to spend under various components like maintenance of website, publicity, implementation of previous recommendations, event management, accommodation and food for members and supporting staff, transportation, salary of staff, hiring of manpower and miscellaneous expenditure. Norka-Roots CEO Harikrishnan Namboothiri K said that it was a routine budgetary allocation. “It is only budget allocation. The previous year, this amount was utilized for giving relief to stranded NRKs in Kerala due to Covid. This is the only the budget approval,” he said. Sources in government departments said that administrative sanction is the first step towards expenditure of amount allocated under head of accounts in the budget for the implementation of a programme. This is followed by technical sanction or financial sanction. Financial sanction is being given considering the nature of expense and the current circumstances. The second edition of LKS was marred by the controversy related to food bills. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan later told the assembly that no amount was spent on meeting the expenditure required for food bills for LKS-2. In 2019-20, Rs 3.04 crore was allotted for the conduct of LKS and the expenditure stood at Rs 1.21 crore. The highest expenditure was recorded for venue arrangements at Niyamasabha and additional works at venue such as main hall arrangements, dining hall and walkway Rs 36 lakh. An amount of Rs 23.42 lakh was spent on accommodation of delegates in 2019-20. The budget for 2018-19 had allotted Rs 10 crore for LKS-1. Following floods, a plan cut of Rs 5 crore was made and Rs 2.48 crore was allotted for the event. As many as 48 recommendations had emerged out of LKS-1 and LKS secretariat had merged key suggestions into 10 and out of this, seven recommendations were successfully implemented before LKS-2, according to the order giving administrative sanction for LKS-3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-to-spend-rs-1cr-for-pravasi-meet/articleshow/84932171.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Amaravati||Film screenings resume in Andhra Pradesh after second wave break||AMARAVATI: After a long lull due to the second wave, movie theatres in the state were back in action from Friday. However, only around 10 to 15% of theatres began screening films on Friday with the release of two small-budget films—Timmarusu and Ishq—across the state. A few multiplexes in Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Guntur and Tirupati screened movies while a majority of single screen theatres remained closed. Sources said the release of big budget films are likely to be scheduled around Dasara in October, provided there is no third wave. The absence of big budget movies is a reason for movie exhibitors shying away from opening theatres. The film exhibitors are moving slow to resume operations for fear of incurring losses due to the ceiling fixed by the state government on movie ticket prices. The exhibitors have been demanding suspension of the controversial government order that has put a cap on the ticket prices. The state government had allowed theatres to open from July 18 but the exhibitors did not resume screening due to the ceiling on ticket prices. “The situation is really bad as both the exhibitor and theatre owners are not in a position to handle the expenses in running the screens. While operating theatres with 50% occupancy itself is a big task, managing them with very low prices as well is worrisome,” said NV Prasad, president of the AP Film Exhibitors Federation. He requested chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy to reconsider the issue and allow them to increase ticket prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/film-screenings-resume-after-second-wave-break/articleshow/84904634.cms||Samdani MN

Sitamarhi Sadar SDPO Ramakant Upadhayay said the deceased were identified as Dabsa Begum (14), Abid Ansari (7) and six-month-old Saima Khatoon. He said at least three other children playing there were also injured in the accident.

The DSP said the truck driver and co-driver fled from the spot after the accident. “No receipt of sand required for transporting sand was found inside the truck,” he said. Upadhayay said it seems the overloaded truck was trying to overtake some other vehicle near the spot. “The road where accident took place is narrow. It seems the truck wheels skidded off the road and the driver lost balance and fell sideways due to overloaded sand. The sand got spilled and the children got crushed underneath,” the DSP said. He said the bodies were extricated only after a heavy-duty crane was used to pull the truck straight and sand got removed. Upadhayay said further investigations were on in connection with the accident.

The arrested men revealed that they used to cheat people of the United States in the name of getting personal loan and home loans. Laptops and hard disks and several gadgets with data of many US citizens have been recovered from the spot. It is said that the gang was operating here for the last six months. ADCP Crime Deepak Bhuker said the arrested persons have been identified as Ravi Shukla and Vishal Singh Sengar, both residents of Hanspuram Naubasta. Three more persons were working at the call centre, however, they were let off as they had no role in the matter, said the police. ADCP said that this call centre was being run at the home of one of the accused Vikas’s uncle. “The accused pretended to be a representative of American companies and lured US citizens in the name of offering home loans and personal loans at low interest rates. Two apps Xten and Xlife were used to make calls through VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol). The number dialing was done using the software Text Now Sonotel and Soft Phone Dialer,” said ADCP further. He said that the accused used to talk over phone and if someone fell into their trap then they used to take $200 from them in the name of processing fee. They used to send forms in the name of American companies and after gaining the confidence of victims they asked them to deposit four to five instalments of loan amounting to 500-600 dollars together on the pretext of zero interest on EMI. Officials added that the two fraudsters had targeted 45 US citizens during the past six months and have duped many people of around Rs 70 lakh. The police have recovered laptops and hard drives containing data of 2.5 lakh US citizens. During interrogation, the two accused revealed that they had bought this data from an agency at Rs 2.5 per hundred persons. Officials said that one of their partners operates from Noida and assisted them from there. “Their aide in Noida helped them in getting the money, which used to come from outside and then transact into their accounts. The accused have two accounts for transaction. Efforts are being made to arrest their Noida partner soon,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/gang-of-fraudsters-duping-us-citizens-busted/articleshow/84904522.cms||---

Inaugurating the interim office and research laboratory of the proposed National Dolphin Research Centre at Patna Science College, the minister pointed out that water from the Ganga would be diverted to a reservoir through a canal. “The government will take a final decision in this matter after which a suitable plot of land will be acquired on the northern side of the river for developing a dolphin park,” he added. Work on construction of the proposed dolphin research centre at Rani Ghat on the campus of Patna University (PU) will begin soon as its “tender has already been approved”. The principal secretary of the environment, forest and climate change department, Dipak Kumar Singh, said the building of the research centre would be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 30 crore. Popularly known as the ‘Dolphin Man of India’, Ravindra Kumar Sinha expressed pleasure over the final approval of the research centre in PU for which he had been striving hard since 1994. “This centre will promote research in genetics as well,” he claimed. Speaking on the occasion, Bihar State Pollution Control Board chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh said the centre would prove to be a milestone in the field of dolphin research. PU vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Chaudhary, in his presidential remarks, exclaimed that it was a matter of pride for the university to have Asia’s first dolphin research centre on its campus. Pleading for annual counting of dolphins in the Ganga, Zoological Survey of India’s regional director Gopal Sharma said, “There are 1,465 dolphins in the Ganga within the confines of Bihar.” At the outset, PU science faculty dean S R Padmadeo welcomed the guests and G B Chand conducted the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-to-get-dolphin-park-soon-minister/articleshow/84904059.cms||B K Mishra

The state government admitted the canal was encroached upon for laying of a road but no forest land was occupied. The high court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya observed that it was difficult to digest that those who occupied an irrigation canal would not encroach into forest lands. Former MLC T G V Krishna Reddy moved the high court challenging inaction of irrigation and forest department officials in preventing those who encroached into the reserve forest and landfilled the Nagarjuna Sagar irrigation canal under Paritala village for a stretch of about eight kilometres. He argued the canal has disappeared completely with laying of the road. Counsel for the petitioner, N V Sumanth, argued the canal is supposed to supply irrigation water to upland areas of Krishna district. With the laying of road to pave the way for mining activity, water cannot flow in the canal and is affecting the interests of thousands of farmers. Special government pleader C Sumon told the bench that it is true that the canal has been encroached upon and irrigation department officials issued notices in 2018. However, there is no encroachments into the forest land, he said. The high court directed verifying the factual situation on the ground and submitting satellite images to the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/court-calls-for-satellite-images-of-reserve-forest/articleshow/84904519.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The three civic bodies are located on the banks of the Krishna. The chief minister asked officials to complete work on integrated solid waste management plants in 72 towns in the next 12 months. The chief minister took stock of arrangements for the launch of Clean AP (CLAP) and other major works initiated by the municipal administration and urban development department with senior officials. The chief minister observed that civic bodies should not be allowed to release effluents into nearby rivers and canals. He asked the officials to ready a blueprint in such a way that no city or town in the state let sewage into canals. He directed officials to ready proposals to resume underground drainage (UGD) works in Vijayawada, Guntur and Nellore cities. The chief minister asked officials to focus on building and construction waste management in cities and towns. The construction waste material should be scientifically disposed to avoid piling up of debris in garbage plants. “Concentrate on road maintenance works in the cities and towns immediately after the rainy season. Coordinate with the roads and buildings department for efficient management of roads. All roads should be pothole-free and clean,” said Jagan. The chief minister has also directed officials to gear up to launch land registrations in ward and village secretariats. He said the facility of registration of assets in the ward and village secretariats will take government services closer to people. It would also help prevent malpractices in registrations, he observed. Speaking at a review meeting at the camp office on Friday, the chief minister said registrations in ward secretariats would ensure proper monitoring and control over land transactions to field officials. He added that it would help prevent encroachments and illegal transfers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/sewage-treatment-plants-on-anvil-to-curb-release-of-effluents-in-krishna/articleshow/84904453.cms||Samdani MN

However, eight other accused, including a BJP MLA’s nephew, are evading arrest, Purnia range IG Suresh Kumar Chaudhary said on Friday. Police are interrogating the arrested persons, he said. Paswan was shot dead at Santoshi Chowk under Town police station of Katihar at around 9.30pm on Thursday. He was mayor for hardly around two months after getting elected unopposed earlier this year. He was politically well connected and had climbed the success ladder rapidly in the last six months. The mayor’s post had fallen vacant after the incumbent was elected to the state assembly last year. Katihar municipal commissioner Minendra Kumar said Paswan was mayor till June 26 this year. “He had a tenure of hardly two months. Fresh elections could not be conducted due to Covid-19,” he said and added: Paswan was councillor of ward 16 for two consecutive terms. His wife Manju Devi has represented ward 17 for three consecutive terms.” The motive behind the murder is not clear yet. Raids are on to nab the other accused named in the FIR, the IG said and added, Paswan’s supporters protested at the KMCH and the Town police station last night. Additional forces have been deployed at a few places as per necessity.” Postmortem was conducted at Sadar hospital by a medical board, he added. Town police station SHO Raghvendra Prasad Singh said those arrested are Pintu Paswan (32) and his brother Shubham Paswan (28) and Kumkum Devi (55) and her daughter Manisha Srivastava (28). They are residents of Driver Tola near Santoshi Chowk. “The killers were hiding around Kumkum’s house outside which the former mayor had parked his bike just before his murder. Paswan had left home after receiving a phone call on Thursday night,” he said. Singh said Paswan’s brother Chotu Paswan has lodged an FIR against 12 persons, including the four arrested. “Neeraj Paswan is the prime accused in the FIR. He is the nephew of a BJP MLA from Katihar,” Singh added. He said four abandoned bikes, suspected to be used by the killers, two countrymade pistols, including a semi-automatic one, two empty and three live cartridges were recovered from the spot on Friday. “Police have also seized cellphones of all the four arrested persons,” Singh said. He said the former mayor used to deal in real estate also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/4-arrested-in-katihars-ex-mayor-murder-case/articleshow/84901806.cms||Debashish Karmakar

NCDs had accrued to Telangana after the spilt of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh in 2014. Transmission companies of AP and Telangana will have to pay fines of Rs 3 lakh each. It’s rare for government-owned companies to be fined for regulatory lapses. According to the two Sebi orders, the case relates to 2017 and 2018. On April 3, 2018, IDBI Trusteeship Services, the trustees for some of the NCDs issued by Transmission Corp of AP, informed Sebi that the issuer had expressed its inability to pay interest and principal on some of these debentures. AP Transco had said this was mainly because Telangana Transco didn’t transfer the redemption amount to its AP counterpart. Since the NCDs were listed on the BSE, Sebi also carried out an investigation through the exchange and found several disclosure violations by the two companies. Subsequently, after giving a chance to the two companies to explain their positions about the non-disclosures, the regulator imposed fines of Rs 3 lakh. Around the time the default had happened on these NCDs, some of the ratings agencies had also put the ratings of these companies at ‘D’, indicating default. It’s also rare for government-owned companies to get rated at ‘D’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/transmission-cos-in-ap-tgana-fined/articleshow/84906507.cms||---

As many as 38 councillors voted against Meera and two against the motion. Votes of 14 councillors were declared invalid by the magistrate and the observer appointed by the district administration. Of 58 ward councillors present during the floor test at Bankipore circle office of the civic body, 54 took part in the voting. Two councillors from Meera’s camp – Vinay Kumar Pappu (ward number 28) and Archana Rai (ward number 29) – boycotted the voting. Section 144 was imposed in the Bankipore circle office and voting was held amid tight security. After losing her chair, Meera told this newspaper that she welcomed the decision. “I respect the decision of the corporation. I am only against the factionalism in the civic body. I presented my point in the meeting and refuted all the charges levelled against me. I am thankful to all councillors who supported me,” she said. The meeting was chaired by Patna mayor Sita Sahu and coordinated by the municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma, who will now send a report to the State Election Commission (SEC) and district administration.

Mayor Sita Sahu, who did not cast her vote, said, “We now need a sensible deputy mayor so that development works in the city accelerate. We are happy with the development and looking forward for the election of new deputy mayor.” Manoj Kumar alias Munna Jaiswal, member of empowered standing committee of the civic body, said Meera had failed to gain confidence of the councillors because of her “incompetency” and “arrogant nature”. “She always used to create problems in the meetings besides disrupting the development works of the civic body,” Jaiswal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-confidence-motion-patna-deputy-mayor-loses-chair/articleshow/84901968.cms||Faryal Rumi

While recommending the same, the assembly also unanimously passed a resolution recommending that doctors and paramedical personnel in the city who have served during Covid-19 be nominated by Delhi government for the Padma awards. “We all have seen how not just our country but the entire world has been suffering because of the pandemic. During this period, our doctors and paramedic staff put their lives at stake to serve the nation. We are aware of how some doctors could not visit their homes for six-odd months and served humanity without caring for their families and themselves,” Kejriwal reiterated his demand during a discussion on a motion moved by AAP legislator Saurabh Bharadwaj for the Padma awards. “In such a time, it is the duty of the whole society to thank the medical community,” the CM said. Bharadwaj underlined that the doctors couldn’t be thanked enough for their contribution. Kejriwal highlighted Delhi government had provided doctors with five-star quarantine accommodation. It also honoured frontline workers with Rs 1-crore compensation in case of their death, he added. “It assured them that if by chance something happens to them, Delhi government is there to support their families.” The government has already asked people to nominate doctors and paramedics for the Padma awards. “We have received 2,100 nominations of doctors as of now. We will screen all these names and send a list to the Centre,” Kejriwal said. Supporting the demands, leader of the Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said, “The Padma awards should also be given to safai karamcharis, police personnel, teachers and others who have lost their lives in the line of duty. Around 300 corona warriors have died in the line of duty and they all should be paid the compensation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/medical-fraternity-should-collectively-get-bharat-ratna-cm/articleshow/84907622.cms||---

Stating that he has sought removal of encroachments along river banks, Thackeray said he has sent for all reports prepared by expert panels in the past on flood mitigation and some strict decisions will be taken by the government for the benefit of flood-prone villages. During his visit to Kolhapur district, to take stock of damage caused by floods, Thackeray urged affected people to decide among themselves about their rehabilitation, and asked flood-prone villages to unanimously pass a resolution about it. “If the entire village is ready for rehabilitation, the government will provide all help needed.” At a press conference, he said he has instructed the administration to remove encroachments along river banks and prevent construction there. “Floodplains have been marked for a reason and they must be maintained like that,” said Thackeray. He also added that work on preparing an action plan to manage additional water of swollen rivers will begin soon. “A geological study will be undertaken to find solutions to landslides and caving of roads,” he said. Over 200 died and over 4.3 lakh were evacuatedin Konkan and Western Maharashtra. During his visit, Thackeray happened to meet leader of the opposition, Devendra Fadnavis, in Shahupuri.

The event happened at Anaiyur Kokkulam with police protection and under the watchful eyes of the Thirumangalam tahsildar. Belonging to the paraiyar community, these dalits had been denied permission by elders of the village to enter the Pekkaman Karuppasamy temple since time immemorial. M Chinnasamy, a member of the VCK, says the fact that the temple is surrounded by land parcels belonging to about twenty dalit families is proof that they worshipped in this temple. But now, as the temple has good revenue, non-dalits, predominantly piramalai kallars who are in majority in the village, did not allow them to offer worship. It is the dalit families living around the temple who perform the rituals in the temple, and the priest is also from their families. Other dalits, except these twenty families, are not allowed into the temple. The temple’s fame in the region, its revenue and landed assets of about eight acres are said to be the reason why the piramalai kallars are the main members of the organizing committee. One of the dalits approached Madurai high court bench which ordered the district administration to take action. When an inquiry was conducted, the non-dalits denied the charges. The matter was taken up with the HR and CE, which said that the temple was situated on HR and CE land, but belonged to the category of ``small temples’’ Chittrayee, 69, who went into the temple around 4.30 pm said, ``I do not remember anyone from my family ever having entered this temple.’’ VCK state organising secretary M Ellalan and other members led the temple entry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dalits-enter-temple-for-first-time-under-police-protection/articleshow/84905293.cms||---

In the petition, the Centre stated that these 65 people being illegal migrants have no legal right to claim to seek Indian citizenship since the relief claimed by them is specifically barred as per the provisions of Citizenship Act, 1955. The Centre stated that the single judge had failed to consider the fact that these 65 were not willing to get the benefit of the Sirimavo- Shastri Pact and they had not applied for getting repatriation till October 30, 1981. The Centre stated that there are 60,000 Sri Lankan refugees in 107 camps in Tamil Nadu on the same footing. Additionally, it is reported that 35,000 non-camp refugees are residing in the state. Admitting the appeal, a division bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice T S Sivagnanam observed that the appeal has to be heard particularly in the light of several observations made in the order by the single judge. Taking into account that the 65 people have filed contempt petitions before the single judge, the judges observed that the single bench should be slow in allowing the contempt proceedings to be pursued before the conclusion of the appeal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/citizenship-for-65-lankan-tamils-centre-contests-order/articleshow/84905285.cms||---

The district administration in turn investigated the claims and found that not only Pennycuick did not live in this building, it was built after his death. District collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar, in a statement on Friday, said there was no evidence of Col Pennycuick having resided in the building. “Pennycuick was born on January 15, 1841, and died on March 9, 1911. However, the bhoomi puja for the existing PWD building referred to by the farmers was conducted in 1912 and work was completed in 1913. Hence, there is no chance of the late British engineer having resided in this building,” said the collector. Minister for PWD, E V Velu who was in Madurai last week, said they have almost finalised the PWD building on the Madurai-Natham road for the Rs 70 crore Kalaignar memorial library. Members of the Federation of Periyar-Vaigai Irrigation Ayacut Farmers’s Association made a representation not to take it forward. President of the federation M P Raman had said that the site chosen for the library was where Col Pennycuick had once lived. “He is considered a god by farmers, and his house is like a temple,” he had stated in the petition. Secretary K Thirupathi said Pennycuick was worshipped by farmers, like Karikala Cholan who constructed the Kalannai dam, and that the government should decide on another place for the library.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/district-admin-trashes-claims-on-site-chosen-for-kalaignar-library/articleshow/84905305.cms||---

Replying to questions in the assembly, Jain said South Delhi Municipal Corporation, which owes Delhi government Rs 760 crore, hadn’t paid the dues for the past two years, the east corporation Rs 3,669 crore for four years and the north corporation Rs 2,407 crore for six years. Jain said the government could easily settle the amount by deducting it from the funds it allocated to the corporations, but had been postponing any action as the civic bodies couldn’t even pay salaries. BJP legislator Vijender Gupta said there had been “deep cuts” in the grants-in-aid by Delhi government, resulting in further pain to the municipal exchequer. Jain replied that 8.5% of the tax collected by the government was assigned to the corporations and due to the dip in tax collection, this fund had been proportionately affected too. The minister, however, added that separate funds had been provided for just paying salaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/civic-bodies-yet-to-pay-delhi-govt-rs-6837cr-jain/articleshow/84907662.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The amendments were approved in the 39th GST council meeting after wide deliberations,” Sisodia said in the assembly. The amendments include removal of compulsory submission of audited annual accounts and reconciliation statements for registered taxpayers. “Since audit and reconciliation was necessary earlier, traders had to be reliant on chartered and cost accountants,” Sisodia said. In case of detention, seizure and release of goods and conveyance in transit, the products can be released on payment of only the penalty opposed to the previous practice of goods being released on the payment of applicable tax and penalty. Also, interest charged in case of delay in filing GST would be payable on the net amount and not on the gross amount, applicable retrospectively from July 1, 2017. Another amendment was targeted at individuals who set up fake firms in the names of others and get away with claiming tax refunds. “In case of appeal against order of proper officer for goods in transit, the precondition amount has been increased to 25%, while in other cases it will remain 10%,” said the deputy CM. Sisodia also moved a motion to amend the “Bed and Breakfast Scheme” to promote tourism in Delhi, which was passed. Now, houses can get registered as bed and breakfast facilities within 30 days instead of 90 days. Under this scheme, tourists, especially foreigners, can stay in a family’s home to experience Indian traditions and culture. Sisodia, who is also the tourism minister, said shortening of the registration process would help cover more households and owners would get the certificate online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gst-amendment-bill-passed-to-ease-tax-woes/articleshow/84907707.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Nagpur||No special drive, bedridden to be inoculated routinely||Nagpur: With the implementation of new guidelines, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has dropped the plan of vaccinating bedridden people by undertaking a special drive and will inoculate them on daily basis. Vaccination will continue in 156 Covishield centres and five Covaxin centres on Saturday. TOI had reported on Thursday that the state government made consent, presence of and monitoring for 30 minutes by the treating doctor mandatory to vaccinate bedridden people. Due to these new guidelines along with a few more, NMC had postponed vaccination of 52 bedridden people which was supposed to be done on Thursday. Then, the civic body sent emails to applicants and directed them to submit consent and presence letters of the treating doctor. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI, "None of the applicants submitted the requisite letters as on Friday. Applicants seem to require more time to get letters and readiness or availability at specific times of treating doctors during vaccination,” he said. Joshi added, “We expect to get letters in a phased manner and not from all 52 at a time. A special drive is not suitable and will delay vaccination. Therefore, we decided to vaccinate them on daily basis as per the convenience of team and beneficiaries after receipt of all letters," he said. The state government delivered fresh stock of 1.06 lakh doses of Covishield and 15,000 doses of Covaxin to the district. NMC and zilla parishad (ZP) received the doses on Friday. Accordingly, inoculation continued in 161 NMC centres in the city and 138 centres of ZP in rural parts of the district on Friday. As many as 20,677 people took the jab in NMC's centres and 887 in private centres. Thus, 21,564 took the vaccine in the city on Friday. Vaccination increased on Friday as against the numbers on Thursday. Inoculation continued on Thursday but in a limited manner due to shortage of doses. 7,283 doses were administered at NMC centres on Thursday. In Nagpur rural, 7,110 people got the jab on Friday. NMC and ZP will continue vaccination in full force on Saturday with the help of fresh stock received from the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-special-drive-bedridden-to-be-inoculated-routinely/articleshow/84902679.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Congress's dalit leaders meet Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, list pending issues||CHANDIGARH: Dalit leaders of Punjab Congress took up pending issues of the SC community with Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu. Some of them reiterated the demand for more representation in the state cabinet, while others welcomed the chief minister’s decision to bring in a new SC bill. Amritsar West MLA Raj Kumar Verka said there are 32 MLAs from the dalit community and the state has an SC population of about 32%. “Going by this, the ideal representation should have been six cabinet berths, but there are three SCs ministers at present. We have raised this issue with the party high command and also with chief minister Amarinder Singh. We are hopeful that this shortfall will be corrected.” The meeting with SC leaders remained inconclusive and Sidhu will again meet them on Tuesday. Sidhu also met ministers and MLAs belonging to the three districts of Fatehgarh Sahib, Mohali and Ropar to take their feedback on various issues. A Punjab Congress spokesperson said, “State party president Navjot Singh Sidhu had two-hour long discussion with Congress leadership from the scheduled castes community about issues faced by Dalits of Punjab. The meeting had a consensus on the policies and programmes for benefit of the community while emphasizing that every problem faced by the community must be resolved on priority basis. Sidhu along with working president Sukwinder Singh Danny and state leadership decided to meet again next week for further discussions on the party’s vision for the dalit community of Punjab.” Cabinet minister Aruna Chowdhary said after the meeting that the pending issues of the community were discussed. “The government is close to resolving some issues. Some leaders also gave their suggestions to the party president,” she said. On more representation in the government, she said Punjab no doubt had the highest Dalit population by proportion in the country. “But posts are not the only issues and other issues pertaining to the Dalits need to be acted upon so that the Congress enters the poll fray with bright chances,” she said. Meanwhile, a section of leaders appreciated the decision of the state government to introduce ‘Punjab State Welfare and Development of Scheduled Castes (Planning, Earmarking and Utilization of Financial Resources) Sub-Allocation Bill, 2021’. Congress MLA Raj Kumar Chhabewal said, “Punjab will be first state in north India to bring such an Act. We are 31.9% Dalits in the state and the corresponding budget will be earmarked for dedicated schemes and there will be no scope of diverting the budget.” On talks of cabinet reshuffle, Chhabewal said it was a prerogative of the chief minister. “The implementation of the 85th implementation has been an issue. The new bill on SCs will resolve many pending matters as it will ensure surplus money for scholarships and other schemes. Till now, the funds for Dalits were often diverted,” added Verka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-sc-leaders-list-issues-with-sidhu/articleshow/84907716.cms||---

The house also has business interests in Delhi. The search continued even on Friday. As per the press release issued by Surabhi Ahluwalia, commissioner of Income Tax (media and technical policy), the group is in the business of manufacturing pan masala and real estate. "A total of 31 premises, spread across Kanpur, Noida, Ghaziabad, Delhi and Kolkata, were searched," the release said. The group has been earning huge profits through unaccounted sale of pan masala and also through unaccounted real estate business. The unaccounted income was laundered back into the concerns through a vast link of shell companies. Digital and paper evidence found during the search revealed a nation-wide network of paper companies created by the group. The directors of these companies are persons of no financial means, the release stated. "While some of the directors are not even filing their income tax returns, the others file returns of extremely meagre amounts. Field investigations further revealed that these paper companies did not exist at the addresses mentioned and never conducted any business," the release said. Surprisingly, in just three years, these companies had advanced ‘loans’ and ‘advances’ to the real estate group amounting to Rs 226 crore. A network of 115 such shell companies has been found. The forensic analysis of the digital data is in progress. The main ‘directors’ also admitted that they were only ‘dummy directors’ and signed on the dotted lines as and when required in return for commission for their ‘services’, the release said. The modus operandi is similar with respect to the business of pan masala as they too have laundered back their unaccounted income through an extensive network of such shell companies. Unaccounted loans and premiums received from such paper companies exceeding Rs. 110 crore in three years, have been detected, the release further said. It has also been discovered that through some of these paper companies based in Kolkata, bogus sale and purchase of manure has been shown, amounting to Rs. 80 crore so that cash can be deposited into bank accounts. During the search, cash amounting to more than Rs 52 lakh and 7 kg of gold was found. The preliminary figures indicate unaccounted transactions exceeding Rs. 400 crore, the press release further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/30k-it-raid/articleshow/84904614.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||They were friends indeed to 2 docs in need!Friendship Day||Surat/Ahmedabad: Reel friendship immortalized by Bollywood blockbuster ‘Three Idiots’ song ‘Jaane nahi denge tujhe…’ was played in real life in Covid-19 pandemic when two sets of friends from Surat and Ahmedabad moved heaven and earth in a bid to save two doctors from the jaws of death. Dr Sanket Mehta, a Surat-based anesthesiologist, came back from the brink after a total 96 days of hospitalization. There was a time when Dr Mehta had machines breathing for him and he showed no chance of recovery. Dr Mehta’s friends Dr Jayesh Thakral, Dr Sandeep Patel and Dr Hiren Shah dug in their heels that if there was only 1% chance of his survival, they were ready to bet on that. The friends along with relatives raised Rs 80 lakh through crowdfunding and another Rs 8 lakh from the doctor fraternity to shift Dr Mehta to Chennai in an air ambulance. “If I am alive today it is because of my friends who refused to concede defeat and let me go,” an emotional Dr Mehta told TOI. The good doctor himself won many hearts when a video of him risking his own life in Covid-19 ICU as a patient to intubate another patient went viral on social media. “It was a tough call for the family, but we convinced them that we wish the best for him, and we would take responsibility for the risks we were running,” said Dr Thakral. Likewise, Dr Patel in Ahmedabad too had great friends rallying for him when he fought for life during second wave. Dr Patel succumbed but his friends say their consolation is they did all to give him a fighting chance. Dr Patel (43) and his entire family was Covid positive in May at the peak of the second wave. He lost his father and later became critical with severe Covid-19 with his lungs becoming completely non-functional. Shailesh Patel, owner of a medical store and Dr Patel’s friend for over 15 years, said that all his batchmates such as Dr Pranav Joshi and Dr Vismit Joshipura came together to support Dr Patel. “We did all we could – right from getting the emergency bed to raising funds – to get one fighting chance for Dr Patel,” he said. Patel not only went to Chennai ahead of the air ambulance at the end of May and arranged for the room at the hospital, but also ensured all the logistics and support for Dr Patel’s family back home. After his unfortunate demise mid-June, Patel got his clinic on Anandnagar road on rent so that his family is looked after. “Dr Patel never said no to any of his friends or patients. He had earned so many friends – and thus, he passed away in peace, knowing that they would take care not only of him but his family,” said Patel. The friends had raised close to Rs 1 crore for Dr Patel’s treatment. Dr Yogesh Mori, president of Junior Doctors Association (JDA), said that during both first and second waves of Covid-19, many resident doctors had got infected. “But it was the support of friends that they continued their duty with diligence,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/they-were-friends-indeed-to-2-docs-in-needfriendship-day/articleshow/84932153.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Replying to questions regarding difficulty faced in many parts of the capital in getting new ration cards, Hussain said that the number of beneficiaries in Delhi is 72,77,995 and Delhi government has asked the Centre to increase the upper limit but nothing has happened on that front. He also said that AAP government had made all preparations for doorstep delivery of ration but the scheme couldn’t be launched because the GNCTD (Amendment) Act, 2021 came into effect.

---||Nagpur||Lawyer filed bail plea without Vakalatnama, HC told||Nagpur: More skeletons are tumbling out in the case where Nagpur bench of Bombay high court ordered an inquiry against a lawyer for allegedly suppressing facts while filing a bail application of a rape accused. As per the report submitted by principal district and sessions judge (PDJ) to the HC, the lawyer in question didn’t have Vakalatnama from the petitioner Swapnil Ramteke, nor from his brother. The PDJ in his report also mentioned that he interrogated the accused lawyer, who claimed that the accused’s brother had given him oral instructions to file the second bail application, without mentioning the facts of the first one rejected by judge RR Patare on March 19, 2021. Justice Deo then orally told Ramteke’s counsel Mir Nagman Ali to file a detailed affidavit on whether petitioner’s brother had instructed the lawyer to file a second bail application. The hearing was then adjourned for a week. TOI had on Friday filed a detailed report on HC flaying the lawyer for suppressing facts while filing second bail application of the accused that is pending before another sessions judge SR Trivedi. The petitioner was booked under Section 376 along with Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act by Wathoda police station last year for allegedly raping a 13-year-old girl on July 12. He moved the HC after his first bail plea was cancelled on March 19, 2021. Later, it came to fore that the petitioner had filed a second bail application before another judge while suppressing that his first application was rejected. Justice Deo then asked the principal judge to submit a photocopy of the entire record of first and second bail pleas filed by Ramteke, and inform whether those are filed without instructions and whether entire facts are disclosed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lawyer-filed-bail-plea-without-vakalatnama-hc-told/articleshow/84902796.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The BSP leader, accompanied by party general secretary Nashattar Pal, met the former chief minister at his residence in Badal village. SAD MLA Kanwarjit Singh Barkandi was also present. Garhi said he had come to take the blessings of Badal and learn from his vast experience in public life. Describing Badal as one of the tallest leaders of the country, the BSP leader said, “We are keen on taking his feedback on key issues to be taken up for resolution in the next SAD-BSP government.” He said the former chief minister disclosed that health and education had deteriorated during Congress tenure and it was of utmost importance to give a push to both sectors in the next alliance government, besides taking responsibility for creating employment opportunities for youth. He said discussions were also held on ways and means to improve soil, water and air health in the state. BSP leaders said they were committed to peace and communal harmony, which had been the cornerstone of Badal-led governments in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bsps-state-chief-calls-on-badal/articleshow/84907745.cms||---
---||Business||New IDBI owners may get RBI road map to cut stake||NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to provide a road map to the new owners of IDBI Bank for reducing their stake as the government seeks to sell its equity, along with shares held by Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India, by the end of the current fiscal year.  Although the RBI has not firmed up its views on new licensing norms for private banks, announcement of the new structure may help generate more interest in the lender, which the Centre has been seeking to reposition for two decades but with little success.  In the past, the RBI had indicated that the government’s stake sale and announcement of the new norms were not linked. Sources, however, said that the government has been in dialogue with the RBI on stake sale and the regulator was aware of the need to provide a road map for comfort to potential buyers. The current guidelines stipulate 40% minimum shareholding in terms of the paid up capital or voting rights. Over 10 years, this needs to be diluted to 20-30% and further reduced to 15-26% between 12 and 15 years, depending on the licence vintage. An internal group set up by the RBI had proposed reworking these, apart from allowing corporate houses into the space. Many of the bidders may seek clarity on these aspects. Recently, the department of investment and public asset management had said that the government and LIC would decide on the extent of stake sale during the process of finalising the deal. Although private investors are keen that the government holds no stake, something that NITI Aayog too had noted in some of its recommendations, government sources said, the idea was to leave it to bidders to decide the best course of action. “Someone may want majority control, while someone may like to do with a lower stake. Let the bidders decide,” said a source. The government currently holds 45.5% in the financial institution-turned-universal bank with LIC’s shareholding pegged at 49.2%. On Friday, the bank’s share rose 0.4% to close at Rs 37.9 on BSE but is still lower than LIC’s acquisition price. LIC had acquired shares in IDBI Bank in three tranches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/new-idbi-owners-may-get-rbi-road-map-to-cut-stake/articleshow/84910653.cms||Sidhartha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ED summons Anil Deshmukh for 4th time; SC to hear plea on Tuesday||NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned former state home minister Anil Deshmukh and his son Hrishikesh for the fourth time on Monday, few hours after Supreme Court on Friday posted his petition for hearing on August 3. The court told ED to file its reply. Deshmukh and Hrishikesh had filed a petition before SC seeking protection from coercive action in the money-laundering case investigated by ED. Earlier, Deshmukh released a video from an undisclosed location stating that his petition was pending before SC, and based on its outcome he would appear before ED for a statement. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Krishna Murari and V Ramasubramanian said there were similar petitions filed by other petitioners pertaining to Section 45(1) of PMLA for putting limitations for granting bail. Section 45(1) of the Act has two pre-conditions for bail: the public prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose bail and the court is satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for believing that the person is not guilty of the offence, and the person is not likely to commit any crime while on bail. But the apex court declared it unconstitutional and government subsequently brought an amendment which allegedly revived the provision. In the petition filed through advocate Avadh Bihari Kaushik, the former minister contended that SC had granted interim protection to other petitioners who challenged the provisions and pleaded for the same relief. “This court, in similar matters, especially relating to determination on whether twin limitations on bail under Section 45(1) of PMLA stand revived post the amendment carried out in 2018,” the petition said, “'This court in Nikesh Tarachand Shah case categorically held the twin conditions under Section 45(1) of PMLA to be unconstitutional. An amendment was brought in March 2018, which did not explicitly resurrect or revive the twin conditions. Despite the clear position of law that once a court strikes down a provision the same is erased from statute book, ED has been urging opposition to bail across the country that such twin conditions have been revived and resurrected,” the petition said. Last month, ED arrested Deshmukh’s private secretary (additional collector rank office) Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde in the case. On behalf of Deshmukh, they were allegedly coordinating with police officers to collect money illegally from bar owners in the city. ED also found that now dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze had collected Rs 4.7 crore from bar owners in the city and gave the cash to Deshmukh through Shinde. Subsequently, Deshmukh’s son Rishikesh, with the help of Delhi hawala operators, transferred Rs 4.18 crore to Deshmukh’s Nagpur educational trust as a donation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-summons-deshmukh-for-4th-time-sc-to-hear-plea-on-tuesday/articleshow/84907797.cms||---

Punjab BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma said on Friday the Congress government in the state had failed to give adequate representation to the OBCs. “Unfortunately, Capt Amarinder Singh as a chief minister has not implemented the central government’s directions to give constitutional status to the state backward class commission as given to the national commission by the Narendra Modi government,” he added. By not following the directions of the central government, the Congress had made it clear that it did not care for the betterment of the OBCs and the state commission remains toothless, claimed Sharma. He promised the BJP would give constitutional status to the state commission when it came to power in the state. “The historic and visionary decision for 27% reservation for OBC and 10% for economically backward classes for medical students will benefit thousands of students. It reflects the Prime Minister’s commitment to uplift the disadvantaged segments of our society,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-promises-constitutional-status-for-state-bc-commission/articleshow/84907781.cms||---

This is the second time this year that Bengal witnessed such an achievement; the first was a few days ago when the Higher Secondary results were declared and Rumana Sultana from Kandi in Murshidabad stopped short of the perfect score by just a mark. South Point, celebrating Archisman’s achievement, will soon see him off as he leaves for the US to study mathematics as his intended major at the College of Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. He bagged admission to six reputable US universities but chose this campus because of its high global rank. “I want to remain in the academics and pursue mathematics in higher studies,” he said. Not too far behind was Megha Abedin, who topped DPS Ruby Park with 99.2%. It was an especially proud moment for her because she is from the humanities stream and scored much higher than the rest of the near-top scores from the science stream. “I want to stay back in Kolkata and study history in either Presidency or JU and then prepare for my civil services exams,” she said. Nearly 47% candidates from DPS Ruby Park have scored above 90%. Abedin’s high score was shared by Lokesh Somani from the commerce stream at Birla High School and Sanchit Mukherjee from the science stream at BDM International School. Commerce students have reportedly fared better than those from the two other streams at Birla High School. “I am looking forward to studying economics honours at Delhi University, if I get a seat there. The experience of studying in Delhi will give me added confidence. The application process will start from August 2,” Lokesh said. With 56 boys placed above 95%, the school is overjoyed. Ritu Kulshreshtha has topped her school, Shri Shikshayatan, scoring 99% in science. “My dream is to study computer science engineering at IIT Kharagpur. I have written the JEE Mains and I hope to be able to sit for the JEE Advanced, too,” she said. Many schools are happy that while it is traditionally believed the toppers are mostly from science or commerce, several from humanities this year have bagged the top slot. Ronjinee Chattopadhyay from the humanities stream at BDM International has scored 99%. “I want to study sociology and will apply at Jadavpur University, Presidency and St Xavier’s College. I don’t want to leave the city just yet. I am not sure about what I wish to do after graduation and I hope the next three years will help me firm up my plans,” she said. At Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, too, humanities pipped commerce and science this time, as Sakshi Singhania topped the school with 98.4%. The school has 49 students in the 95-plus category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbse-topper-leads-high-scorer-club-with-1-mark-short-of-500/articleshow/84905571.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Ex-manager plotted heist as he had over Rs 1 crore loans||MUMBAI: Under mounting pressure to clear his loans, a former manager of ICICI Bank’s Virar (East) branch plotted a robbery at the bank on Thursday evening. During interrogation, Anil Dubey, who was caught with the over Rs3 crore booty, has confessed that he committed the crime as he had taken loans of over Rs 1 crore from three banks and had to pay monthly instalments of Rs 1.2 lakh. He had worked at the bank between January 2019 and August 2020 before joining as branch head of another private sector bank in Naigaon. He was terminated from his job on Friday. Dubey, who barged into the bank on Thursday, threatned the two women employees who were working till late and robbed cash and gold from the lockers. He slashed the women with a razor, leaving one dead and one grievously injured. After being nabbed Dubey told police his accomplice had escaped. However, cashier Shraddha Devrukhkar, who is recuperating at Sanjeevani Hospital in Virar, told police he had come alone. His car was found at a distance from the bank. Dubey knew the two women and was aware they would be working till late due to month-end accounting work. He had planned to threaten the women and escape with the loot. But when deputy manager Yogita Vartak resisted, he pulled out a razor and slashed her neck. She collapsed on the floor and was later declared dead on arrival at a hospital. Dubey then charged toward Devrukhkar and slashed her on the neck as well. Mira Bhayander Vasai Virar Commissionerate commissioner Sadananad Date visited Devrukhkar and applauded her for her courage. Vartak, a resident of Phoolpada in Virar (east), had been with the Virar branch for the past few years. Police said hours before the crime, Dubey had called her up to inquire about work. Vartak is survived by her husband and a seven-year-old son. Devrukhkar, a resident of Gokul Township in Virar (west), is unable to speak due to her injuries. The mother of one has been communicating using sign language. Relatives said she was in a state of shock after having seen Vartak, with whom she shared a good rapport, in a pool of blood. Dubey has been booked for murder, attempt to murder and robbery. He has been remanded in police custody for a week.

Dr Paltewar has been booked in a fraud case lodged against him by another director Ganesh Chakkarwar. “It was submitted that the petitioner remained non-cooperative during the period of interim protection, as well as this court on merits has rejected this application,” said Justice Vinay Joshi. The judge, however, extended the interim protection granted to him on March 17 for three weeks to allow him to approach Supreme Court. “The petitioner has every right to test HC order before the higher forum. However, if he is arrested, then ultimately his right to approach the higher court would be frustrated,” the judge added. The petitioner through counsels — Avinash and Akash Gupta — had applied for anticipatory bail in case of arrest by Sitabuldi police, with whom the complaint against him has been lodged. Assistant public prosecutor Kalyani Deshpande appeared for the police. An offence was registered against Dr Paltewar in 2019 for alleged irregularities in the state government’s Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY). Subsequently, he was booked under sections 406, 409, 420, 465, 467, 268, 471 of IPC 66 (C) of the Information Technology Act, 2000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-rejects-dr-paltewars-anticipatory-bail-plea/articleshow/84902934.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

They fear that the local body, if the current situation worsens, will fall further into category D (triple lockdown) by Onam festival and it will have a negative bearing on their income. Adding fuel to their woes, many customers fail to adhere to Covid norms during shopping and even prefer shopping carrying babies. Traders want to open the shops all day with extended working time to reduce crowding of customers. With Onam round the corner, traders want relaxation at the earliest to avoid crowding in shops at the last minute. “If the local body falls into category D in the coming days, then all our business will be affected badly. Our hope is on Onam festival sales. I have been selling clothes on Broadway for the last 15 years,” says Gopi, a street vendor. “Instead of allowing shops to open based on the category each local body falls, the government should either allow all shops to open for a month and vaccinate all the population above 18 years,” says Sumi, a saleswoman. “I had pledged some gold ornaments in February this year. I have received appropriation notice this month for failing in EMI repayment.We don’t know how the Covid situation is going to evolve and affect us,” said Vidya, a shop owner in Broadway. Meanwhile, district health authorities said that the possibility of the local body to fall in category D was very less as testing has been increased in areas where cases are high. “Currently, we conduct testing in around .4% of the total population in the corporation per week. We plan to increase it to .7% per week,” said a health official. Meanwhile, an antigen testing camp was held at Ernakulam market to test traders and employees. Of the tests conducted among 330 people, only one tested Covid positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/traders-fear-more-covid-curbs-in-city-will-affect-onam-sales/articleshow/84902936.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Will soon declare the results of the 700 students given admission without varsity’s knowledge: SDSU V-C||Haridwar: The vice-chancellor of the Sri Dev Suman University (SDSU), Pitamber Dhyani, has clarified that the results of the 700 students, who were given admission by private educational institutions without taking the varsity in confidence, will be released soon. Earlier, the results of these students were held back after finding out that 14 private universities — 12 in Haridwar and the remaining in Dehradun — affiliated to the Sri Dev Suman University (SDSU) allegedly flouted norms by giving admissions to a total of 700 more students than the permissible limit. Dhyani said that the results of the 700 students will be released as they are not at fault. "It is the wrongdoing of the private colleges/universities and certain SDSU employees," he said. Earlier, the SDSU administration had said that if the private universities under the lens are found guilty of any wrongdoing, their affiliations will likely be cancelled. Last week, Uttarakhand higher education minister Dhan Singh Rawat also ordered a probe into the alleged violation of guidelines by the 14 private universities. Meanwhile, a few of the colleges figuring in the list of 14 'offenders', denied their involvement in any wrongdoing. They said that their names in the list have, perhaps, been included "by mistake." Chaman Lal College, Haridwar principal Sushil Upadhyaya said that against the sanctioned strength of 400, the college has admitted 367 students and the result of none of the college students has been withheld. A similar claim was made by HEC Group of Institutes, Haridwar chairman Sandeep Chaudhari. Upadhyaya added students download examination forms from the university website, fill them out and submit them directly to the university online, according to the university system. "The colleges have no role to play in the entire process. The university accepts the forms, publishes a roll list to be sent to the colleges before commencement of examinations, and allows students to download their examination admit cards. Under the circumstances, the colleges can neither verify the number of students filling in forms nor can they monitor if students, in their examination forms, mention the same subjects which they shortlisted at the time of admission. Another college principal claiming anonymity said that while introducing 10% reservation in admissions for the economically weaker section (EWS), the government and higher education directorate promised a 10% increase in seats in the colleges. "Some colleges might have granted admission beyond the prescribed seats in anticipation of the university order," the principal said. "There are several cases in which the university takes years to communicate its decision after panel inspection of a college is completed for an increase in seats and the colleges grant admission in anticipation," the principal added. Attempts were made to contact the university registrar for his comment but in vain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/will-soon-declare-the-results-of-the-700-students-given-admission-without-varsitys-knowledge-sdsu-v-c/articleshow/84902943.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Pune||Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar pledges adequate funds for Metro||PUNE: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said the government was considering extending the Pune Metro to Katraj, Wagholi, Hadapsar, Chandni Chowk, and Nigdi as part of its plan to strengthen public transport in the city. Pawar — also the district guardian minister — said the government will adequately fund the project. Pawar on Friday flagged off the official Metro trial run on a three-kilometre stretch between the Vanaz depot and the Ideal Colony station on Paud Road. This section is part of the 14km elevated Vanaz-Ramwadi route. Deputy chairperson of state legislative council Neelam Gorhe and city mayor Muralidhar Mohol were present on the occasion. “The Katraj extension will be underground as an elevated route is not feasible. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) should take the lead and give the proposal the sanctions necessary. I have discussed the proposal with the mayor. The Union government will not be providing more funds for the project as it is an extension of the existing corridor. Similar steps have been taken for an extension from Pimpri to Nigdi,” Pawar said. Pawar pointed out the projects like the Metro are executed with contributions from the Union and state governments and the local civic bodies. “The state government will contribute its share to complete the Metro work and issue the necessary clearances to avoid delays,” the deputy chief minister said. The deputy chief minister said the city was rapidly growing and there was a need to provide effective service for better commuting. Around 60% work of the ongoing Metro project has been completed so far. The remaining work is expected to be completed at the earliest. Mayor Mohol said that PMC has planned a high-capacity mass transit route (HCMTR) project in the city to improve traffic movement. “Options can be explored to introduce Metro Neo services on HCMTR to strengthen public transport. The Union government has given the go ahead for Metro project in Nashik and other cities,” Mohol said. Meanwhile, MahaMetro officials said they were looking forward to completing the trials on parts of the priority Metro routes by the end of 2021 and start commercial service. “We already have conducted trials on the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC)-Dapodi route and similar checks have started on Vanaz-Garware College stretch. We are looking to start in 2021,” MahaMetro managing director Brijesh Dixit said. Officials said the trial runs will continue for a few days. Various technical and safety parameters will be checked, in addition to alignment of tracks, platforms, overhead traction and signalling apparatus,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dy-cm-pledges-adequate-funds-for-metro/articleshow/84907580.cms||---
---||Pune||189 projects in Pune barred from sales, show RERA data||PUNE: The Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) has prohibited a total of 644 housing projects across Maharashtra from selling sny more units at their projects, due to delayed completion and delivery, with Pune accounting for nearly 30% of it. Most developers of the blacklisted projects, according to released data, are smaller players with fewer than 100 units per project, aside from a few projects by reputed players in the region. Around 85% of the blacklisted projects had 70 units in every project on average. A blacklisting of such kind indicates that the project cannot be sold, marketed or advertised in any way. The list also includes a few projects by the state government-promoted Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA). A report by the property market observers Anarock noted that 80% of the units in the 644 projects have already been sold. 16% of the projects were scheduled to be completed in 2017, while the rest were supposed to be finished in 2018, MahaRERA data showed. Due to the size of the market, Mumbai led the list with as many as 274 blacklisted projects, or around 43% of the total, with Pune following at 29%. The rest are situated in smaller markets, such as Nagpur, Nashik, Kolhapur, Aurangabad and others. “This move by MahaRERA sends out a strong signal to errant developers who have being delaying projects incessantly. Homebuyers have been waiting to get possession since 2017 or 2018. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has at least 496 projects (launched in 2014 or before) that are either delayed or stuck as on date, while Pune has nearly 171 delayed or stuck projects,” said Anuj Puri, the chairman of Anarock. A developer in the region said smaller developers are increasingly struggling with RERA compliance, such as proof of capital and due diligence for land, with banks, NBFCs and housing finance firms often unwilling to advance capital to such players for the fear of low or insufficient securitization.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/189-projects-in-pune-barred-from-sales-show-rera-data/articleshow/84905634.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Board opens HSC link for confirming seat numbers||MUMBAI: In an attempt to avoid a repeat of the crash of the SSC results link two weeks ago, the state education board has thrown open its HSC results link for students to confirm their seat numbers. HSC results are expected any time now. On Thursday, the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) enabled the link—https://mh-hsc.ac.in. HSC students who accessed the link found their names along with the word ‘pass’. Students said they thought the results had been declared but their marks had not been uploaded. Board officials clarified the link was opened to test if it would crash. The SSC link was thrown open to students on July 16 without any trial run. The link soon crashed and students could not access their results till late in the evening. Alternative links were provided in the evening. A committee set up to inquire into the reasons for the crash suggested that the HSC link be thrown open before the actual results are out. After the cancellation of HSC exams due to the second Covid-19 wave, all students have been declared passed. Students were evaluated based on their performances in Class X, XI and XII in a 30:30:40 ratio. The Supreme Court has directed all states to declare Class XII results by July 31. While students are anxiously awaiting the results, most are worried about their Class XI scores. Both students and teachers had urged the state to not consider marks of Class XI exams as most do not take them seriously.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-board-opens-hsc-link-for-confirming-seat-numbers/articleshow/84907952.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Two more aides of ‘killer’ cop arrested||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has arrested two associates of the constable held for killing a 28-year-old man in east Delhi allegedly in a road rage incident. The accused have been identified as Vikas (34) from Shahdara and Vineet from Bulandshahr. Vikas worked at a movie studio in Noida while Vineet is a property dealer. Earlier, constable Monu Sirohi and his friend Harish had been arrested. Police are trying to trace the body that was dumped in Gang Nahar in Muradnagar, Uttar Pradesh. Trained divers will be used to fish out the body. Nearby police stations have been alerted to inform if any unidentified body had been found in or along the canal in the first two weeks of June. While the incident happened on June 4, an FIR of abduction was registered only on July 27 and the constable was arrested three days ago after a video of the group thrashing the deceased, Ajeet, had gone viral. During interrogation, police found that all the accused were friends of the constable. On the fateful night, they came to see Sirohi to discuss a marriage proposal for Vineet and have a party. After the murder, Vikas and Vineet had fled to Mumbai. The cops tracked their location through technical surveillance. But on reaching Mumbai, they found that the accused had shifted to Jaipur. Another team went there and both were arrested with help from the local police. They were produced before the Karkardooma court on Friday and remanded in six days’ police custody. Joint commissioner Sagar Preet Hooda has been asked to monitor the case while the area DCP is supervising the investigation. The station house officer of New Ashok Nagar in east Delhi, where the incident happened, has been suspended for initially not registering an FIR despite complaints and for not initiating any probe. It has been found that Ajeet and his friend Atul got into an altercation with the cop and his three friends when their vehicles had a minor collision. Ajeet and Atul were brutally thrashed and the former was abducted in Sirohi’s car while Atul escaped. Ajeet was killed and his body was disposed of by the cop with the help of his friends. The constable had resumed his duties immediately after the murder to stay clear of any suspicion. He had also kept a close watch on the happenings at New Ashok Nagar police station despite being posted at Pandav Nagar and called his colleagues every evening to know about the kind of FIRs that were registered. Sirohi often went to party with his friends to Gang Nahar and was aware of the topography, said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-more-aides-of-killer-cop-arrested/articleshow/84907976.cms||---
---||Pune||NFAI adds 450 glass slides of old Telugu films to its rich collection||PUNE: The National Film Archive of India (NFAI) has added more than 450 glass slides of 70 Telugu films to its collection. “These glass slides are an integral part of the early cinema viewing experience. Made by pressing a film positive between two thin glass squares, these slides were used for announcing new attractions before the start of a film or during intervals in theatres. The film positives used to prepare the glass slide were miniatures of the film poster or publicity material for newspapers and magazines,” a statement issued by NFAI on Friday said. The black and white slides represent the pictorial history of early Telugu cinema from 1939 to 1955 and feature frames tracing the gravitas of the films during the early decades of Indian talkies. The acquisition includes slides from many important films like Y V Rao’s trendsetting social dram about widow remarriage ‘Malli Pelli’ (1939), B N Reddi’s ‘Vande Mataram’ (1939), starring Chittor V Nagaiah, popular swashbuckling hit ‘Keelu Gurram’ (1949), featuring Akkineni Nageshwara Rao and Anjali Devi, another hit N T Rama Rao starrer ‘Daasi’ (1952), critically acclaimed adaptation of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay’s classic Devdas Vedantam Raghavaiah’s ‘Devadasu’ (1953), starring Akkineni Nageshwara Rao, Savitri and Lalitha in the central roles and many more. Last year too, the archive acquired nearly 400 glass slides, and has over 2,000 of them from Hindi, Gujarati and Telugu films. Director of NFAI Prakash Magdum said, “Glass slides are exquisite records of Indian cinematic heritage, and we are happy to preserve these in our archival collection.” Magdum added: “In fast-changing technologies, having these glass slides in such huge numbers is a rare and significant. Film lovers can deposit footage, photographs, posters, lobby cards and other such material so that they can be preserved.” Arti Karkhanis, in-charge of documentation at NFAI, said, “These glass slides give a bird’s eye view of the publicity scenario in the Telugu industry in its formative years. It has a great reference value for film researchers, and we will digitize them soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nfai-adds-450-glass-slides-of-old-telugu-films-to-its-rich-collection/articleshow/84905643.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||In Punjab, groundwater extraction is 59% more than annual recharge||CHANDIGARH: In a telling indicator of the extent of over-exploitation of groundwater in Punjab, 33.85 Billion Cubic Metre (BCM) is extracted for all uses against the total annual recharge of 22.8 BCM. This adds up to groundwater over-exploitation of over 59%. Out of the total 150 blocks assessed in Punjab, 117 (78%) have been categorised as over-exploited where the annual groundwater extraction is more than the annual extractable resource. As per an assessment jointly carried out by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and Punjab government last year, the annual extractable groundwater resource is just 20.6 BCM. Out of the total annual extraction for all uses, 32.8 BCM (97%) is being utilised for irrigation and most of it goes into cultivation of the water-guzzling paddy crop. Union minister of state for jal shakti and food processing industries Prahlad Singh Patel shared these facts in the ongoing monsoon session of the Parliament while answering a question raised by Shiromani Akali Dal’s MP from Bathinda Harsimrat Kaur Badal. "The stage of groundwater extraction, which is a measure of annual groundwater extraction for all uses (irrigation, industrial and domestic uses) over annual extractable groundwater resource is 164% in Punjab as per the 2020 assessment," he added. Patel also said the ‘Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater – 2020’ has been prepared by CGWB in consultation with states and UTs, indicating various structures for the different terrain conditions of the country. In Punjab, it envisages construction of about 11 lakh rain water harvesting and artificial recharge structures to harness 1,200 Million Cubic Metre (MCM) of monsoon rainfall. Water being a state subject, initiatives on water management, including conservation and water harvesting in the country is primarily state responsibility, said the minister. The central government had launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan in 2019, a campaign to improve water availability, including groundwater conditions, in water stressed blocks of 256 districts in India, including 20 districts in Punjab. Initiatives by PunjabThe minister for jal shakti also apprised the Lok Sabha that Punjab has taken up 4,262 water conservation works and 35,809 works of renovation of ponds under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme till June 30, 2021. Under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna (Watershed Development Component) in Punjab, 1,988 water harvesting structures have also been created or rejuvenated. The state government has also constructed low dams to provide irrigation facilities under Bharat Nirman Program costing Rs170 crore, to help in augmenting the groundwater resources of the state and help in arresting the declining groundwater table. Rooftop rain water harvesting has been made mandatory in all buildings above 200 square yards by amending the buildings by-laws. The Punjab government has also enacted the Punjab Water Resources (Management and Regulation) Act, 2020 on February 12, 2020, and established the Punjab Water Resources and Development Authority, 2020, to ensure development, management and conservation of water resources. The state government has notified sowing of paddy nursery from May 10 of the year and transplantation of paddy from June 10 onwards under the Punjab Preservation of Sub-Soil Water Act, 2009. The transplantation of paddy has been shifted to coincide with onset of monsoon season so as to conserve precious groundwater. In 2019, about 501,000 hectare area was covered under Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR), which was increased in 2020-21 to 554.29 thousand hectare. In addition, short duration varieties like PR 126 are also being promoted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-punjab-groundwater-extraction-is-59-more-than-annual-recharge/articleshow/84907937.cms||Sanjeev Verma
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Opposition walks out of assembly||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Continuing its protests against the government demanding the resignation of general education minister V Sivankutty in the wake of Supreme Court order in the assembly ruckus case, the opposition boycotted the assembly proceedings for the second consecutive day, on Friday. The opposition boycotted the proceedings when the Question Hour was in progress. Quoting the records of the Kerala legislative assembly and instances from other assemblies, opposition leader V D Satheesan said that the chief minister had misled the assembly on Thursday while stating that in all the other assemblies, the issues inside them were settled there itself without dragging it to courts. The opposition leader quoted the proceedings of the state assembly on January 29, 1970, when the then speaker D Damodaran Potti had suspended five opposition members who attacked him. The speaker had also permitted a police official, who was on duty in the assembly and who was also manhandled by the members, to file a police case against them. The suspended members include C B Chandrasekhara Warrier, A V Aryan, E M George, T M Meethiyan and Prabhakara Thandar. “Whatever the chief minister has said in the assembly is untrue. There is a precedent in our assembly itself. Also in the Maharashtra assembly, one of the members who damaged the speaker’s mike was expelled and also convicted for six months by the court,” Satheesan said. Citing the cases of former ministers in the state, including K Karunakaran, M P Gangadharan, R Balakrishna Pillai, N Srinivasan, K P Vishwanathan, T U Kurivilla, K K Ramachandran, Thomas Chandy, K T Jaleel and K M Mani, he said that all of them had tendered their resignations just on the basis of adverse comments from the court. But in the case of Sivankutty, the court, that too the Supreme Court, has asked him to face trial, Satheesan contended. The opposition leader said that a crime is considered to be committed against the government and in this case, where it is destruction of public property, it is the duty of the government to take action against the perpetrators. He said that the opposition has decided to take the protest against Sivankutty outside the assembly. “We are firm on our stand that the education minister should resign from the post,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/opposition-walks-out-of-assembly/articleshow/84905719.cms||---
---||Kochi||Flooding plagues service roads||Thiruvananthapuram: Ever since the works of the new national highway (NH) bypass stretch was completed, the services roads and surrounding regions have been plagued by stormwater flooding whenever the city receives excess rainfall. Sometimes the entire service roads are submerged in stormwater and at times it is the nearby residential areas that lie on a lower plane than the service roads that are affected. Currently, the residential area of Palace Nagar near Technopark has been experiencing flash floods during rains. Though the engineering wing of the city corporation had approached the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) seeking its cooperation in constructing a drainage system here, the request was turned down as NHAI believed that it would only worsen the problems they already faced. City corporation’s executive engineer G Rani said that the help they asked NHAI was related to laying a drain pipe across the service road so that the stormwater can be directed to the drainage system of the highway. “It would have saved us labour and time in constructing a new drainage system here,” the executive engineer said, adding that they were now looking at the possibility of constructing a drainage system with the help of the district panchayat. Officials of NHAI said that allowing connection of a drain pipe from a residential area might only help in more waterlogging on the road as there is a risk of domestic waste dumped into the drain causing blockades. “Our drainage lanes are designed for the purpose of draining stormwater alone. Still, we are experiencing flash floods on the roads here,” said NHAI project manager Pradeep. This is owing to the fault in the existing drainage system here having pipes of disproportionate sizes. While the drainage pipes laid by NHAI have a bigger diameter, the pipes that take the stormwater to Thettiyar stream flowing through the Technopark campus are narrow. The entire region has only two outlets to carry stormwater from the highway to Thettiyar. Last year, NHAI had submitted a proposal before the government recommending to increase the number of outlets, replace the existing pipes with new ones with bigger diameter and construct box culverts to facilitate easy desilting of sand deposited in the drainage. A year on, this proposal is yet to be addressed by the government. When contacted, officials concerned of the minor irrigation department said that they do not have funds currently to carry out such major works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/flooding-plagues-service-roads/articleshow/84903195.cms||---

---||Mumbai||At 1,119mm, Mumbai sees fourth highest July rain since 2015||MUMBAI: The city recorded its fourth highest July rainfall since 2015, with 1,119mm till July 30. July rain has crossed this year’s mark thrice: In 2018 (1,138.8mm), 2019 (1,464mm) and last year, when for the first time in July it crossed the 1,500mm mark for the month, making it the all-time highest. In 2005, when Mumbai was flooded, July recorded 1,454.5mm of rain. In all other years since 2015, rainfall for July has been below 1,000mm, with it being lowest in 2015, when 359.1mm was recorded. Most of July’s heavy rainfall was restricted to few hours, leading to waterlogging coupled with loss of lives and property. July witnessed two landslides on days of intense rain. Some instances of extremely heavy rain was between July 17-18,when IMD’s Santacruz observatory recorded 235mm, while between July 16-17 Santacruz recorded 253mm. “Typical synoptic features that lead to heavy rain were in place, due to which the city saw an intense downpour during those few days,” said an IMD official. The month covered up for its average rainfall of 827mm on July 19 itself.

---||Chandigarh||Untreated waste polluting Satluj, Beas, says Centre||BATHINDA: Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has said stretches of the Satluj and Beas rivers in Punjab are polluted mainly due to discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage and industrial effluents, which is because of problems in operation and maintenance of sewage/effluent treatment plants. Rapid urbanisation and industrialisation have compounded the problems. Shekhawat gave this information in Lok Sabha on Thursday, while responding to queries about pollution in Satluj and Beas. The minister said as per the latest report published by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in September 2018, 351 polluted stretches were identified on 323 rivers based on monitoring results in terms of bio-chemical oxygen demand, an indicator of organic pollution. These included one stretch each on Satluj and Beas rivers and Kali Bein (tributary of river Beas) which confluence upstream of Harike Barrage, from where Rajasthan Feeder/Indira Gandhi Canal and Ferozepur Feeder originate. MPs Bhagwant Mann and Hanuman Beniwal from Punjab and Rajasthan had asked whether the government was aware of waste water effluents and pollutants being released into Satluj and Beas and their tributaries. Also, whether the government was aware that people in many districts of Rajasthan and Punjab used this water for drinking, and whether the government was contemplating to formulate a concrete scheme to check it and take action against the industrial units and urban authorities responsible for discharging effluents into the rivers and canals. The minister said the central government had been providing financial and technical assistance for controlling pollution on identified stretches of rivers/tributaries through centrally sponsored scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP). Under NRCP, pollution abatement projects for conservation of Satluj and Beas rivers have been implemented in 14 towns of Punjab — Banga, Bholath, Dasuya, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Ludhiana, Moga, Mukerian, Nawanshehar, Phagwara, Phillaur, Sultanpur Lodhi and Tanda at a total cost of Rs.717.32 crore with sewage treatment capacity of 648.20 million litres per day (MLD) created in these towns. Based on inspections carried out by CPCB in June 2021, actions have been initiated as per the statutory provisions against the STPs, CETPs and the ETPs of grossly water polluting units found non- compliant, he said. Water released in Ferozpur Feeder canal is used for drinking and irrigation purposes in Malwa region of Punjab and some parts of Rajasthan through Gang Canal/Indira Gandhi Feeder Canal which passes through Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. In Rajasthan, Indira Gandhi Canal traverses through western part covering districts of Barmer, Bikaner, Churu, Hanumangarh, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Sriganganagar and Nagaur to provide water for drinking and irrigation in these areas. Canal waters as reported by the Punjab Pollution Control Board and Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board, require conventional treatment and disinfection to make it suitable for drinking purposes, and not having adverse effects on human beings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/untreated-waste-polluting-satluj-beas-says-centre/articleshow/84908053.cms||Neel Kamal

However, for this to materialise, the jurisdictions of state highways and Trichy corporation in maintaining roads have to be revamped since the former has better technical expertise in commissioning flyovers. Sources in the state highways said a new flyover taking off from the congested HPO signal, thereby linking the Puthur signal near MGMGH, was suggested to municipal administration minister K N Nehru recently. While a DPR is to be prepared, the roads covered including Bharathidasan road and EVR road are maintained by Trichy corporation. The civic body has funding and technical expertise constraints in proposing and even constructing new flyovers. “Some of the crucial roads like Bharathidasan road and Salai road can be handed over to the state highways for better upkeep,” K Shyam Sundar, member, Trichy Intra-City Development Endeavours (TIDES) said. Similarly, the other proposal envisaging a flyover at Sastri road intersection to facilitate smooth transit of vehicles between Karur bypass road and Thillai Nagar also falls under the civic body’s jurisdiction. State highways department has control over only 21 kms of roads in Trichy city. “Funding will be the challenge in executing the two proposals, state highways can take it up if the civic body is hesitant. A government order has to be passed to take over the civic body roads,” an official source with the state highways said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/flyovers-highways-dept-corpn-need-to-settle-jurisdictional-issues/articleshow/84905749.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Inhuman not to acknowledge manual scavenging deaths in India, toll 26 so far this year’||NEW DELHI: Bezwada Wilson, who heads the Safai Karamchari Andolan, an NGO working to eliminate manual scavenging, told TOI on Friday that the central government's statement in Parliament that no manual scavenging deaths had been recorded in the country in the past five years is inhuman like the practice itself. “It is a very inhuman statement by the minister in Parliament. Just like manual scavenging is an inhuman practice,” Wilson said. He added that Safai Karamchari Andolan had alone documented 472 manual scavenging deaths in the past five years, with 26 deaths while cleaning sewers and septic tanks just in 2021. On Thursday, replying to a question asked about the number of people engaged in manual scavenging who had died in the last five years, the Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment Ramdas Athawale had declared in the Rajya Sabha, “No such deaths have been reported due to manual scavenging.” Wilson said that instead of putting out the real data on manual scavenging, the central government is not even acknowledging the problem. In a reply to a similar question in Lok Sabha in February last year, while maintaining there had been no reports regarding deaths due to manual scavenging, the social justice ministry had maintained, “The National Commission for Safai Karamcharis has received reports regarding the death of persons while cleaning sewers and septic tanks.” The differentiation indicated that deaths due to surface scavenging might be rare. Wilson said that people dying while cleaning sewers and septic tanks couldn’t be categorised differently from manual scavenging deaths. “The ministry seems to think manual scavenging only involves dry latrines. No one may die in dry latrines, but sewage and septic tank cleaners are also manual scavengers. Instead of revealing data on the manual scavenging deaths, the government is trying to bypass the question,” Wilson told TOI. Wilson added that during the previous Parliament session, the ministry had revealed that as many as 340 people had died while cleaning sewers and septic tanks up to December 31, 2020. “We have documented the individual details of each person among the 472 who died of manual scavenging in the last five years. Let us first acknowledge that the problem of inhuman manual scavenging still exists,” said Wilson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/inhuman-not-to-acknowledge-manual-scavenging-deaths-toll-26-so-far-this-yr/articleshow/84908072.cms||Paras Singh

At least 22 of them have been booked under the Disaster Management Act, while 14 pilgrims have been detained and quarantined in a local ashram, according to the state police. Last week, in an attempt to deter devotees, the state had stationed Gangajal tankers on its borders. Railway stations are conducting strict checking of passengers and 1,000 police personnel have been deployed on different inter-state border points. The measures, however, have not been able to entirely halt the movement of kanwarias. Nilesh Bharne, deputy inspector general (DIG) of Uttarakhand police, said, “We sent back 1,221 vehicles, including two wheelers, that were carrying kanwarias. A total of 8,656 kanwarias have been turned away from Haridwar borders in the last five days.” On Wednesday, the high court had expressed concerns over reports of kanwarias trying to sneak into Haridwar and asked the state government why no penal action was being taken under the disaster management Act against those flouting norms. The court had made the observations while hearing a bunch of public interest litigations dealing with the state’s handling of the pandemic and said that “no one can be permitted to violate Covid appropriate behaviour and jeopardise the lives of the local population”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-5-days-ukhand-sends-nearly-9k-kanwarias-home-22-booked/articleshow/84903274.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Prasannakumari, 73, of Manimandiram House, Pangappara, is the deceased. Police have taken Sukumaran into custody on suspicion. She was a bedridden patient. Police suspect that Sukumaran might have strangulated her to death and then attempted to take his own life. Police also believe that Sukumaran might have committed the crime as he was no longer capable of looking after her or he could no longer tolerate her suffering. Sreekaryam SI J Vinod Kumar said that the couple lived with their son, Sunil. The incident happened when Sunil went out in the evening to buy food. When he returned, he noticed that Prasannakumari was lying motionless. Following this, he alerted neighbours and rushed Prasannakumari to hospital. But doctors declared that she was dead on arrival. Police took Sukumaran to the hospital, gave him first-aid treatment and then took him into custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/woman-found-dead-husband-in-custody/articleshow/84903299.cms||---

There will be no supply at Kurla, Ghatkopar, Andheri and Goregaon. “BMC has three reservoirs in Veravali (K East ward). These reservoirs supply drinking water to residents of various areas. To make water supply in these reservoirs more efficient, technical measures and improvements will be undertaken by BMC,” said an official on Friday. “The measures and improvements are in the final stages. Connecting underground pipelines, installing valves and flow meters on main pipelines will be undertaken on Tuesday. Water supply to Kurla-Ghatkopar, Andheri (East and West), Ram Mandir and Goregaon (West) will be disrupted from 8.30am to 10.30pm on August 3,” the official said. Officials said supply in some areas will be at low pressure. Due to work, supply will be provided in all wards (except F North and F South) in the city and in all wards in western suburbs, with 15% reduction. The work includes connection of a water supply inlet between Powai-Veravali reservoirs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-15-water-cut-in-parts-of-city-suburbs-on-tuesday/articleshow/84908074.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Trichy||Plan to connect western suburbs of Trichy||TRICHY: The state highways department has put forward a proposal to develop the existing bund road along Uyyakondan canal as an alternative to Vayalur road to link the western suburbs including Allithurai and Adavathur with Trichy city. The proposal is among the three major road and flyover projects aimed at decongesting city roads and ensuring that roads can keep up with increasing number of vehicles. Vayalur road, which links many residential neighbourhoods including Bharathi Nagar, Kumaran Nagar, Shanmuga Nagar, Ramalinga Nagar and Uyyakondan Thirumalai, is the most congested road in the city. With over 35,000 property assessments on the stretch including Vasan Nagar, the 7.5m wide road is inadequate to handle the huge traffic. A study conducted by the state highways in August 2019 found out that widening the Vayalur road is not feasible as land acquisition will cost a fortune. As a solution, the state highways department proposed to develop the Uyyakondan canal bund road, also called aqueduct road. The 8km stretch connects MGR statue on Settipalam Uyyakondan bridge, Kamala Niketan school, Kuzhumayee Amman temple, Adavathur, Allithurai and Sunnambukaranpatti. If the road is developed with adequate lanes, it may help the people in suburbs such as Adavathur, Allithurai and Nachikurichi to skip Vayalur road. “People from suburbs can use the proposed road to reach core areas of the city, even minibuses can be operated,” V Baskaran, a resident of Woraiyur said. The road is currently managed by PWD and panchayats in Adavathur and Allithurai. “The proposed road can even link the Jeeyapuram-Thayanur stretch of semi-ring road. The new link will also reduce the vehicular flow and traffic congestion near Puthur signal and Mahatma Gandhi Memorial government hospital too,” an official said. As Trichy Corporation has relaid a portion of the road connecting the Uyyakondan riverfront development park, state highways said that the existing road can be further developed to decongest the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/plan-to-connect-western-suburbs-of-trichy-with-city/articleshow/84905780.cms||Deepak Karthik

The deal, set to be announced soon, values the SoftBank-backed startup at around $9 billion, sources said. Oyo, which had become the world’s second-largest hotel chain in 2019 before the pandemic, did not comment on the development. Microsoft, too, did not reply to an email from TOI. The budget hotels startup, led by 27-year-old Ritesh Agarwal, however, closed a $660-million debt financing round earlier this month from global institutional investors with plans to use the capital to reduce part of its existing debt and bolster its tech capabilities. Along with the entire hospitality industry, Oyo’s operations have been battered by pandemic-related travel restrictions. Agarwal, who counts investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures and Airbnb as his backers, had said during the pandemic that the startup has around $1 billion in the bank. Oyo’s valuation had soared to $10 billion in 2019 from $850 million in 2017 before being downgraded by investors on the back of brewing trouble overseas and home market. Industry experts, too, remained skeptical of rapid expansion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/microsoft-to-buy-stake-in-oyo-at-9-billion-valuation/articleshow/84910799.cms||---

The action was initiated after he failed to appear before the court repeatedly. He is accused of smuggling into jail a mobile phone, which he handed over to Pulsar Suni to extort money from actor Dileep, the eighth accused in the case. Vishnu, who was brought to the trial court in Kochi, reportedly submitted that he sustained an injury to his leg in an accident and claimed it as the reason for his absence. He was limping when he went to the court. The case had received national attention after Dileep, a prominent actor in the Malayalam film industry, was named as the eighth accused in the case. The survivor, a film actor, was abducted and sexually assaulted in a moving vehicle by the accused in February 2017. Dileep, who is out on bail, is accused of conspiring to commit the crime. According to the prosecution, Vishnu conspired with Suni in jail to extort money from actor Dileep. Using the phone, the accused contacted Nadirshah, Dileep’s friend, and Appunni, his driver. Vishnu had submitted before court that he would reveal all details of the conspiracy. As many as nine accused persons are facing trial, including Dileep. The trial had hit a roadblock following the events of October last year when Kerala high court dismissed a plea seeking to change the judge in the case. The HC however had held that most of the contentions raised by the survivor and prosecution for transfer of the case were unsustainable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/actor-rape-case-approver-held-for-ignoring-summons/articleshow/84905862.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to police, a call about a food delivery rider being robbed at gunpoint was received on the day of the murder. While scanning footage from CCTV cameras, cops found that the rider’s bike was used by the accused in the murder case as well as it was spotted near the scene of crime.

The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) and New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) had to operate pumps throughout the night in their areas and open the utility access holes to clean the drainage lines in many places to drain out the excess water in their jurisdiction areas. “Operators worked whole night at the pumping stations to pump out the water. Keeping in touch with the irrigation department officials, the water level of Bagjola canal was being monitored. All the pumps were operational. There was an attempt to flush out the water in the canal that was overflowing and pushed it back. We cleaned the gully pits by opening the utility access holes and did whatever could be done,” said a NKDA official, adding that the long term solution to prevent such waterlogging soon is to dredge up the canals properly. “The situation was bad in several places that were submerged while water also entered into the premises of some housing complexes. Dredging up the canals is needed. Another reason for the water not being able to recede is the unplanned dumping of building construction materials and plastic on roads, which resulted in the drainage lines getting clogged,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town Forum and News (NTFN), an umbrella organisation of New Town residents’ forum. In neighbouring Salt Lake, the situation was similar in many parts of the main thoroughfares and inside the blocks that were inundated with over ankle deep water. “Such was the condition that I could not keep my car on the driveway. Water entered into the pump room inside the house,” said Dipankar Mitra, a resident of CL block close to the eastern drainage channel. There was also power cut in some localities in Salt Lake for several hours early on Friday due to a technical snag, adding to the woe of residents. In the areas off Rajarhat, Chinar Park and Baguiati, several areas were also in knee-deep water. The BMC officials said that total 123 pumps were operated to flush out the excess rainwater from Salt Lake and Rajarhat. “Civic workers were deployed across the township to clean the drainage lines to flush out the water,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/clogged-drains-canals-turn-salt-lake-new-town-roads-into-waterways/articleshow/84905837.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Sanjay Patel, a resident of Manjalpur, told the police that the accused siphoned the money from his bank account between July 25 and July 26. The cops are trying to trace the accused by following the money trail. According to Patel, he received a SMS on July 24 informing that he had requested for a new SIM card and later his network was disconnected. He called up the customer care executive who confirmed that a request for a new SIM was indeed made from his number. Patel was asked to approach the mobile store from where the SIM was procured. Patel couldn’t visit the mobile store immediately as it was closed in the evening and the next day was Sunday. On July 26, he approached the mobile store to get his SIM activated again. In the evening, his number was activated following which he got messages about Rs 46.1 lakh being withdrawn from his bank in 14 different transactions. Shocked, Patel then approached his bank to gather details about the transactions. “The accused must have got details about Patel’s bank account and he must have used the SIM to first change the password and then carried out the transactions,” said a cybercrime sleuth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/businessman-duped-of-rs-46l-in-online-fraud/articleshow/84904592.cms||---

In an order released on Thursday, the court was full of praise the gesture by Vyas to stand in the absence of her father, who as an employee of government’s mid-day meal scheme was assigned the duty of a peon at Mahika village of Wankaner taluka on the day of election in February. The daughter turned up before the deputy mamlatdar and offered her services in place of her sick father. The authority realized the problem and requested her not to bother about her father’s absence. But she insisted on an ID card to work as a peon for the day at the polling station. Vyas served as a peon on the election day. The HC came to know about the incident through a news article. It said, “We salute citizens like Miral who stood up at a crucial hour as a disciplined citizen of this country to extend her helping hand on the date of the polling in place of her ailing father. We rarely come across such instances. We salute Ms Miral Vyas for this gesture shown by her.” The court noticed that the government was short of staff for poll duty due to prevalence of Covid-19. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice I J Vora cited Vyas’s example while deciding a petition filed by the Union Co-operative Bank Ltd and its employees, who were assigned poll duties, but most did not turn up. They had approached challenging the election commission’s decision to depute them for election duty citing that the bank was not a state instrumentality. They also sought protection against any possible action by the government for ignoring the mandate. The court said that the elections were already over and the issue was not relevant. “However, we do not want such a thing to be repeated again in future. It was expected of the persons like the writ applicants to extend their helping hand to the state government in difficult times like the Covid pandemic,” the court said and refused to help them. The HC neither extended any protection against possible action, nor has it asked the authorities to take any action against them for defying the orders of the election commission. The HC has left it to the authorities if they intend to initiate any proceedings in accordance with law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-lauds-ca-student-for-poll-duty/articleshow/84905861.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BMC staffer refuses to pay Rs 2.6 lakh alimony to wife he ‘never wanted to marry’, sent to jail||MUMBAI: In a rare instance, a magistrate court recently sent a BMC employee to one month in prison for failing to pay Rs 2.64 lakh in maintenance to his estranged wife. The court said the accused be released after he pays up. In 2017, the man who was earning Rs 30,000 had been ordered to pay monthly maintenance of Rs 6,000. However, when he did not pay the money, the woman moved court, seeking his imprisonment under provisions of the Domestic Violence Act since he had not paid the arrears. The couple was married in 2008. The woman had accused his family and him of cruelty. She alleged that the man told her that he never wanted to marry her. She further alleged that the husband’s family did various things to ensure that they never had privacy. The woman also accused them of physically abusing her. In 2016, she moved the magistrate court. In 2017, the court ordered the maintenance to be paid. However, the husband did not pay up. The woman again moved the court earlier this year. The court had also issued an order to the man’s employer to deduct Rs 10,000 per month from his salary. However, as he remained absent from work he was being paid lesser and so deduction of maintenance was not possible by the employer. The woman then moved court to recover the arrears. In February, the court ordered the man to be sent to prison for specifically defaulting on a month’s maintenance. The man made a part payment of Rs 20,000. The court then ordered for his release. It warned him that if he didn’t pay the remaining amount, he would be back in prison. When he defaulted again, the woman moved court. However, the man did not respond. The court issued a distress warrant against him. “The record goes to show that respondent [man] is a government servant and getting handsome salary, but he is not paying maintenance to the applicant [woman]. I have asked respondent whether he is ready to pay maintenance or part maintenance…He submits that he will not pay single pai to the applicant towards the maintenance, as he is ready to cohabit with her,” the court noted in the order. It further observed that the man had even submitted that he was ready to go to the prison but not pay up. “Today also, he is not ready to pay maintenance or part payment towards it. Therefore, I have no alternative but to send respondent to prison for default of maintenance…,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-staffer-refuses-to-pay-rs-2-6l-alimony-to-wife-he-never-wanted-to-marry-sent-to-jail/articleshow/84908159.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Those arrested were Grant Road resident Prashit Narvekar (48), Santosh Gupta (40), and the gang leader Zain Khan (24) who lives in Dombivli. The accused have been sent to police custody. Police have found Rs 15.9 lakh in two accounts of Zain Enterprises, a company formed by Zain. “We suspect these monies were deposited by victims,” said a police officer. The cyber police received a complaint from a businessman who wanted to expand his business and was looking for a VIP mobile number which people would remember easily. “He got a message enquiring about the same. The sender claimed he was from a known mobile company’s customer care service,” said Dr Rashmi Karandikar, deputy commissioner (Cyber Crime branch). After the complainant showed interest, he was asked to pay Rs 3.3 lakh for the VIP number and was provided a bank account number. He deposited the money. However, he did not hear from the caller and later the number was switched off. He realised that he had been duped and approached the police. The police have found that the accused had bought a domain name similar to the mobile company’s. “Zain was the gang leader, Narvekar and Gupta worked for a commission,” said a police officer. The accused had also created a fake email account to give people the impression that it was the cellular network company’s mail. An FIR was lodged on June 19. Investigators, using the technical intelligence, first nabbed Narvekar and Gupta. While searching Gupta’s belongings, the police said they found a country-made revolver and nine bullets. A separate case under Arms Act was registered against Gupta at Samata Nagar police station. Narvekar and Gupta led thepolice to Khan. However, he had switched off his phone. The police laid a trap near Dombivli and arrested him. Khan said when he was working at a coffee shop, he met four people here who would sell VIP numbers. He learned the tricks from them and in May started selling VIP numbers. He knew Gupta and offered to work with him. Later, Narvekar joined them. The police are still probing how many other bank accounts were used by the accused. They have recovered 10 ATM cards, six phones and eight SIM cards from Gupta While the accused used a fake email account which quite resembled the genuine company, they used the original GST number of the mobile company on their invoices which were printed for cheating people. The accused used a duplicate logo of the mobile company too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-4-who-sold-vip-phone-nos-get-call-from-cops-arrested/articleshow/84908199.cms||Mateen Hafeez

He succeeds Shrimad Vidyadheeraj Teerth Shripad Vader Swami who attained mahanirvan on July 19. The Peetharohan ceremony was held at the premises of the mutt with restricted participation of devotees and followers. Delivering his discourse after the Peetharohan ceremony, Vidyadheesh Teerth Swami underscored the need to perform one’s duty, no matter howsoever small or big, with utmost faith, devotion (bhakti) and determination. “Success is bound to follow,” he said. Quoting from the scriptures, the Swami said that to purify one’s mind, it is essential to dwell on the sublime qualities of the great souls. “There are various ways by which one is able to cleanse his body, but there is no other way to cleanse one’s mind (man-shuddhi), saved by extoling the virtues of the holy men,” said Vidyadheesh Teerth Swami as he paid tributes to his departed guru, Vidyadheeraj Teerth Swami. Earlier, various rituals were performed at the mutt premises. Amidst the ceremonial chanting of Peetharohan Mangalashtaka, the Peetharohan ceremony took place at the auspicious time as prescribed by the koul prasad of Shree Ram Dev. President of the mutt’s central committee, Shrinivas Dempo, in his address exuded confidence that Vidyadheesh Teerth Swami, with his qualities of head and heart, would carry forward the legacy of the mutt that is steeped in religion, spirituality and penance.

---||Goa||Health minister Vishwajit Rane’s U-turn: No one died of oxygen-related issues in Goa||PANAJI: In a major U-turn on the floor of the assembly, Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane, who was the first to announce that many Covid patients were dying in the state due to oxygen interruption at the Goa Medical College (GMC) during the second wave, on Friday denied any oxygen shortage-related deaths. In a written response in the assembly, Rane said: “At no point in time (did) the oxygen supplies at GMC run out of stock, and thus, no death has been reported to have (been) caused due to the non-supply of oxygen. No deaths have been directly attributed to the lack of oxygen. But definitely, consumption per patient increased due to the strain of Covid-19.” TOI had reported that at least 83 persons were suspected to have died due to oxygen-related issues between May 11 and May 15 while undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at GMC. On May 11, at the peak of Covid second wave, Rane had made a startling announcement that 26 Covid-19 patients had died between 2am and 6am due to oxygen shortage at GMC and asked the Bombay high court to probe goings-on at GMC. “Due to interrupted supply of oxygen, we feel that between 2am and 6am, many people are dying in GMC. There is a need for an inquiry directly by the high court. There are petitions pending before it. The HC can appoint an expert committee to find out why deaths are happening between 2am and 6am and come out with a white paper,” he said. His Rane’s statement came on a day when Goa recorded 75 Covid deaths, its highest-ever single-day tally, of which 48 patients died in GMC. None of the govt hospitals in the state ran out of oxygen supplies: Health min“On Monday (May 10), our requirement was about 1,200 cylinders, but we received 400 cylinders. The hospital has been facing a shortage of oxygen supply,” the health minister had said. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, who had visited the Covid wards on May 11, had also hinted that there was oxygen shortage. “It looks like oxygen doesn’t reach the patients. I will not tolerate such acts which will lead to deaths of Covid patients due to oxygen shortage,” he had said immediately after his visit. But on Friday, in written replies to three questions on oxygen-related deaths, Rane outrightly denied there were any deaths but went further and lauded the government. “During sudden surge of Covid active cases in the second week of May, the demand for oxygen had suddenly shot up. But due to extra efforts put in by the government, additional oxygen was made available and at no point in time, none of the government hospitals in the state ran out of oxygen supplies. Therefore, no deaths have been reported to have been caused due to no supplies of oxygen in any Government hospitals in the State till date,” he said. The issue was first flagged by the government’s own doctors through their association, the Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD), on May 1. In a strong letter, the doctors stated that the “oxygen supply in various Covid wards is not even close to sufficient”. Hearing a raft of public interest litigations on Covid mismanagement, Bombay high court justice M S Sonak on May 12 started the proceedings by apologising to the people of Goa for deaths due to oxygen shortage. “We are very sorry. We failed collectively… we owe an apology to all the people,” he said. On May 14, GMC nodal officer Dr Viraj Khandeparkar admitted before the high court that deaths were happening in the premier hospital due to shortage of oxygen. “The oxygen interruptions are causing the problems leading to deaths. Last night (May 13), the interruption that was caused between midnight and 8am caused 15 deaths,” he had said. Even the state health secretary, Ravi Dhawan, admitted that the government was finding it difficult to supply oxygen trolleys on time due to lack of expert drivers for tractors that deliver the oxygen. “There were logistical issues involved in manoeuvring the tractor which carries the trolleys of oxygen and in connecting the cylinders to the manifold. Expert drivers are not available to diver and manoeuvre the tractors for transportation,” he had said in a sworn statement before the high court. The court highlighted the grim picture by stating that 419 Covid deaths took place from May 1 till May 12, where several took place between 2am and 6am, which are directly attributable to logistical issues. “The Right to Life is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Article 21 of the Constitution. There is, therefore, a corresponding duty cast on the state to ensure that this life is not extinguished on account of the inability of the state to supply oxygen to these unfortunate victims of the pandemic,” justices Sonak and N W Sambre had told the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ranes-u-turn-no-one-died-of-o2-related-issues-in-goa/articleshow/84908212.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Coming out strongly in support of Sawant’s statement that the parents should be held responsible and why the girls had gone out late at night, Gaude said: “When such incidents happen, it is the parents who suffer the most. The problem is if you post a cop after every girl, imagine how many policemen will we require? The government is not running away from its responsibility, it is there with the people.” On Wednesday, while briefing the assembly about the progress of made in the investigation in about Sawant had said “When 14-year-olds stay on the beach the whole night, the parents need to introspect. Just because children don’t listen, we cannot put the responsibility on the government and police.” Defending his chief minister, Gaude had said: “The CM has made his stand clear, and being a parent, he said the parents should know where their children are, especially if they are minors. If they have taken permission before going out and whether they are staying at somebody's place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/police-cant-protect-every-single-girl-in-state-gaude/articleshow/84908247.cms||---

But after many scares and near-misses over 100 days, one of the longest Covid hospitalisations in India, Archana beat the coronavirus and walked out on Friday. “I survived for my family,” Archana said after being discharged. “I remember a day when I thought that was it. The pain was too much to bear. But what held me back was my son’s voice. He kept saying everything would be fine.” Puneet Kumar, her elder son, said, “Almost every patient coming to the ward was dying within a couple of weeks. We had lost hope,” he told TOI. When she was brought to the hospital from Mawana, where they live, Archana’s oxygen saturation levels were lower than 30%, she had palpitations and high fever, and was losing consciousness. Five doctors at the hospital were attending to the Covid ward then, round the clock. “April and May were difficult,” said Dr Yogita Singh, who was on Archana’s case. “Patients were dying, families were not always cooperating. But with Archana, her family was a big help.” The moment Archana came in, she was put on BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure), a breathing assistance device for those with serious lung and heart diseases. She had to be kept on this respiratory support for two months. At one point, things turned so serious that she had to be administered support of 100% FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen, a measure of how much oxygen is in the air. The natural air we breathe has 21% FiO2). Then, a non-rebreather mask, meant to deliver high-concentration oxygen in emergencies, supported her for a few weeks. She was gradually brought on to a nasal cannula, which delivers low- to medium-flow oxygen. But in mid-June, another complication struck. Black fungus. “She had developed scars and pimples around her nose and eyes. We thought it’s black fungus but couldn’t stop the steroids,” Singh said. Steroids reduce the body’s immune response, increasing vulnerability to infections like mucormycosis, or black fungus. But they are anti-inflammatory and used for treatment of severe Covid cases in India. Meanwhile, to clear up her lungs, the doctors started her on chest physiotherapy two weeks ago. “She pulled through. In one of the rarest cases, she went straight from ICU to discharge,” Singh added. Her husband Beer Singh, a farmer, and her sons Puneet and Kunal, both pharmacy students, have taken her home now. Hers was one of the longest treatments in India. In January this year, a 59-year-old man from Sola in Gujarat, Devendra Parmar, had been discharged after 113 days in the hospital with Covid. “Archana’s is surely one of the longest Covid-related hospital stays in the country,” said Dr Vinay Agarwal from Delhi, former president of the Indian Medical Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-woman-beats-covid-after-100-days-one-of-the-longest-treatments-in-india/articleshow/84903487.cms||Ishita Mishra

Metropolitan magistrate Richa Sharma acquitted Mohit Kumar and said that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Police had alleged that Kumar was found in possession of a country made pistol with a live cartridge without any licence and a case under various sections of the Arms Act was registered against him. “The possibility of tampering or planting the case property cannot be ruled out... I am of the considered view that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the accused Mohit Kumar is acquitted from the charges levelled against him,” the judge said in the order. The court said, the case of the prosecution was that Kumar was arrested on the basis of information by a secret informer, but one of the witnesses had deposed that Kumar’s mother had made a call to police after which he was taken to police station.

A native of Bari Mohalla under Jalesar police station, jeweller Sunil Kumar, 48, told police that after shutting his shop at 7:30 pm, he reached his scooter parked outside and was about to kick start it when three men with their face covered drove up to him. They threatened to shoot him while snatching his bag. They hit him on the head with the butt of the gun and as he stumbled on the road, sped away. Police found him lying on the road and a search was launched to nab the trio. Police said an FIR has been registered against unidentified thieves and a search is on. Sunil Kumar Tyagi, deputy superintendent of police, said, “ A special team has been tasked to arrest the three miscreants. CCTV recordings of the area on the route around the shop are being scanned. We have got some important leads.” Meanwhile, jeweller association leaders blamed police for not ensuring security in the market. Regional president of the association Rajeev Singhal said, “The jeweller was robbed outside his shop which is at a walking distance from the sub divisional office. Despite repeated requests, police are not able to ensure adequate security in markets. Jewellers are being frequently targeted by miscreants. We will pursue the entire matter with the state government.” Earlier this month, a gang of five robbers looted around 19 kilos of gold worth Rs 9.5 crore and Rs 5 lakh in cash from a Manappuram gold loan finance office in Kamla Nagar area of Agra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/three-bike-borne-men-rob-jeweller-of-cash-ornaments/articleshow/84903503.cms||---

---||Agra||15 ambulance drivers booked in Firozabad & Kasganj for stir, farm union extends support||Agra: Fifteen ambulance drivers have been booked under the Essential Services Maintenance Act and sections of IPC for protesting for the past five days. And a group of drivers have called off their protest "under pressure" for now, sources said. An FIR was registered against eight drivers in Firozabad district and seven in Kasganj. It included district presidents of the Ambulance Drivers' Association. Moreover, over 100 protestors were detained by police. The protesting drivers also received support from one of the farmers' associations, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Swaraj). National president of the farmers' association Kuldeep Pandey said, “Ambulance drivers are working under life-threatening conditions during the Covid-19 pandemic. A majority of them come from families of farmers. For raising their voice against the exploitation by the state government, authorities are registering FIR against the ambulance drivers. We are in complete support of the ambulance drivers.” Kasganj district president of Ambulance Drivers' Association Akhilesh Kumar said, “We are under a lot of pressure from the district administration and health department officials. Authorities have taken the keys of the ambulances and are threatening to send us to jail if we continue with the protest. But, we are not afraid of the FIR registered against us." Sub-divisional magistrate Lalit Kumar said, “We are constantly persuading the drivers to get back to their duty. On the basis of the complaint filed by the district coordinator of the ambulance service, FIR has been registered against seven drivers on protest. The health department has taken the keys of the ambulance from the protestors. We will rope in drivers from other government services if the protest continues." Meanwhile, the chief medical officer of Firozabad district told TOI that the drivers have called off protests and keys have been returned. “The drivers of the 102 and 108 ambulance services have returned to work and keys have been handed back. There are 62 operational ambulances in the district, including four advanced life support vehicles,” Neeta Kulshrestha said. District president of Firozabad ambulance drivers' association Sanjeev Kumar said, “We have ended our protest, for now, under pressure of the district authorities. An FIR was registered against me, and seven other colleagues. Authorities had threatened to send us to jail if the protest did not end. State leadership has given a call to gather for a larger protest in Lucknow. We are discussing the plan ahead.” Notably, ambulance drivers and workers associated with GVK Emergency Management and Research Institute (EMRI) Company launched a strike on the intervening night of July 25 and 26 after the firm’s contract expired and the new agreement was awarded to Ziqitza Healthcare Limited (ZHL) by the government for the operation of the Advanced Life Support (ALS) system ambulances in the state. The protesting drivers claim that the employment conditions offered by the new company are unjust and the government should be considerate towards their selfless service at a time when the Covid-19 was at its peak. Ambulance drivers associated with both the 102 and 108 government-operated helplines have also joined the indefinite protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/15-ambulance-drivers-booked-in-firozabad-kasganj-for-stir-farm-union-extends-support/articleshow/84903553.cms||---
---||Delhi||Childless for 8 years, Ghaziabad couple gets 4 times the joy via IVF||NEW DELHI: A young couple that had been trying to have a baby for the last eight years recently became parents to quadruplets — three boys and a girl. The babies were delivered via in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) at a fertility clinic in South Delhi. Dr Gauri Agarwal, founder of Seeds of Innocence — the clinic where the children were delivered — said the couple from Ghaziabad had been trying to have a baby but it couldn’t happen as the female partner had low ovarian reserve and her reproductive potential was limited. “She had tried assisted reproductive technologies (ART) like intrauterine insemination (IUI) in which sperm is artificially introduced into the woman’s cervix or uterine cavity several times but failed to conceive. Finally, she approached us for IVF,” the doctor said. In IVF, the doctors give fertility medications to stimulate the ovaries to produce several eggs that are ready for fertilisation. The eggs are taken out, mixed with sperm in a lab to fertilise them and the embryos are then put into the uterus to achieve pregnancy. Dr Agarwal said in the case of the 32-year-old woman, they managed to retrieve four eggs that yielded three embryos. All were put into the uterus. “When we did a trans-vaginal scan for viability at six weeks, we found three amniotic sacs and four heartbeats. Six weeks later, it was confirmed that all three embryos had thrived, and one of those got further divided to become twins,” he said. “The would-be parents were offered the option of in-house foetal reduction and explained in detail about risks of carrying quadruplet pregnancy, but they persisted,” the IVF expert said. “The babies – three boys and a girl – were premature after 33 weeks. We kept them under observation for a few days and then the babies were sent home with parents,” said Dr Agarwal. “We are very happy to become parents and that too, of four children. Our family is now complete,” said the parents of the quadruplets, who didn’t want to be identified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/childless-for-8-years-couple-gets-4-times-the-joy-via-ivf/articleshow/84908303.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

A police team laid a trap and caught Rahul Kamble (36) and Zahiruddin Memon (38) while they were collecting the remaining Rs 1.25 lakh from Alhat near the Sakhar Sankul gate. On Friday, the police produced the arrested duo before a magisterial court which ordered their remand in police custody till August 2. Alhat has stated in his complaint that Kamble and Memon presented themselves to him as journalists from a local newspaper. “Using RTI provisions, I have exposed many wrongdoings in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). The two men approached me claiming that, as journalists, they have received complaints against me too from PMC officials and that I could soon land in a legal soup. The two then demanded Rs 2 lakh from me to settle the matter with the PMC officials,” Alhat told TOI. When asked why he did not approach the police earlier when the two demanded money from him, Alhat said he wanted to create evidence against the duo and hence transferred Rs 25,000 each in three instalments to the bank accounts given by them and promised to transfer the remainder sum eventually. He later filed the FIR with the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-arrested-on-charge-of-attempt-to-extort-rs-2-lakh-from-activist/articleshow/84907610.cms||---
---||Kochi||CB team probing co-op bank fraud expanded||Thrissur: The crime branch (CB) team probing the alleged fraud at Karuvannur cooperative bank has been expanded, and the government has shunted out the newly-appointed administrator, who allegedly didn’t act promptly when the fraud was detected earlier. The probe team headed by crime branch SP Sudarshan will now have a strength of 19. According to CB sources, the team will now include a DSP and two CIs, the remaining team members being civil police officers. The team is collecting details of the accused, including the extent of their properties and assets and liabilities of their family members. Hunt is on to locate the accused and a breakthrough is expected soon, the CB sources added. Meanwhile, the government moved M C Ajith, newly appointed administrator, for not having acted promptly when the fraud was detected earlier. Ajith was appointed as administrator after disbanding the CPM-led 13-member panel ruling the bank. A three-member panel headed by P K Raveendran, an assistant director in the cooperation department, has now been appointed to manage the bank. The other two members are cooperative inspectors M M Vinod and K K Pramod. The new administrative panel has begun repaying the deposits in the bank, in a limited manner. According to sources, the bank is now distributing 30 tokens per day and each depositor is being offered a repayment of Rs 10,000, considering that the bank did not have enough resources to return the whole deposits. P B Nooh, registrar of cooperative societies, said that the nine-member panel appointed by the government to probe the circumstances that led to the fraud will submit their report within a month. The panel is expected to recommend measures to salvage the bank and to protect the interests of its customers. The bailout package for the cooperative bank will then be finalized with Kerala Bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cb-team-probing-co-op-bank-fraud-expanded/articleshow/84906024.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Goa||Govt steamrolls budget through House, gets nod for Rs 847cr addl funds||Porvorim: The Goa legislative assembly on Friday passed the budget for 2021-22 amidst a din by the opposition, with CM Pramod Sawant seeking additional funds to the tune of Rs 847.1 crore to meet Covid-19-related expenditure. With the House passing the supplementary demands for grants, the budget size for the state for the current fiscal has increased to Rs 25,902.8 crore. A significant amount of the additional funds sought by the government have been allocated to Goa Medical College and the department of health services. The government expects an additional expenditure of Rs 476.9 crore for revenue purposes and Rs 370.3 crore for capital works. Of the Rs 847 crore additional funds sought by the government, GMC has received Rs 256 crore and the health department has received Rs 103 crore. “The additional funds for GMC are required for purchase of medicines, machinery and equipment for Covid-19, along with purchases for the super speciality block,” said a finance department official. “DHS also utilised funds from the contingency fund during the second wave. The additional funds are required for purchase of vaccines and to recoup the advance sanctioned from the contingency fund.” The social welfare department has received additional funds to the tune of Rs 94 crore, which will be used to compensate Covid-19 victims while also providing relief to the marginalised sector. The government has also made additional provision of Rs 45 crore for the electricity department, which will be used to purchase equipment, power transformers and other equipment that was damaged due to Cyclone Tauktae. On March 24, Sawant presented the BJP-led government’s final budget for the current assembly term, estimating an expenditure of Rs 25,058.65 crore with no clear indication of where the funds would come from. In March, the government tabled the budget and chose to seek a vote on account for five months instead. Sawant had promised sops for everyone from farmers to school children and from the mining belt to taxi operators, when he presented the budget for 2021-22. On Thursday, Marcaim MGP legislator Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar pointed out that although the state had borrowed around Rs 1,000 crore for development work, it had used just 20% of this to create infrastructure. “A small amount was used for infrastructure development and the rest to pay salaries,” Dhavalikar said. On Friday, the government managed to push through the budget while the opposition MLAs were protesting in the well of the House against the government’s move to bulldoze over 10 bills on a single day. The government also got the demands for grants passed through without a discussion, infuriating the opposition further, who then walked out. On the first day of the July assembly session, the government suspended rules 63, 258 and 259 of the rules of procedure and conduct of business of the Goa legislative assembly, regarding a discussion on the annual statement of income and expenditure. On Friday, the budget and the supplementary demands were passed without any discussion or statement from chief minister Pramod Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-steamrolls-budget-through-house-gets-nod-for-rs-847cr-addl-funds/articleshow/84908257.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Business owners seek extension of vaccination deadline||AHMEDABAD: As traders and private office employees wait in queue for hours to get their vaccine shot, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry as well as the Gujarat Traders’ Federation have urged the government to further extend the July 31 deadline for mandatory vaccination. Serpentine queues of people were seen outside vaccination centres at Pandit Deendayal Auditorium in Bodakdev, Tagore Hall in Paldi and several other centres in Vastral and Maninagar areas of the city over the past few days. The state’s apex industry body , on Friday, sought extension of the deadline till August 15, according to the representation made before the Gujarat chief minister. Despite a series of drives organised by civic authorities in Ahmedabad as well as other centres, several office-going employees as well as traders are yet to take their first shot, according to industry sources. Last week itself, a vaccination camp for traders was organised at GCCI office on Sunday. The representation followed after a series of requests from traders and shop-owners who struggle to get vaccinated. Ahmedabad alone is home to at least 2 lakh shops and commercial establishments, and their operations would be impacted if the deadline is not extended. Traders on the other hand have also requested that vaccination must be taken up on a war footing. “The government must ensure adequate supply of vaccines to ensure that all traders and shop employees are vaccinated . If the supply is not adequate to meet the demand, how does one expect traders to voluntarily get vaccinated,” said GTF president Jayendra Tanna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/business-owners-seek-extension-of-vax-deadline/articleshow/84906023.cms||---
---||Meerut||UP cops track phone, intercept & ‘counsel’ man on 200-km march to SC, ask him to turn back||MEERUT: In four days, Praveen Kumar, 32, has covered about 140 km of the 200 km he is walking from Saharanpur in UP to the Supreme Court in Delhi to “reclaim his honour”. The self-proclaimed Hindu nationalist, who has written books on PM Narendra Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath, had been wrongly listed among 1,000-odd people allegedly converted by two Delhi-based preachers. While he marches to prove he never did, his quest is being closely followed by UP cops, who want him to turn back. They are tracking his phone, cutting him off his path and “counselling” him to give up, he said. “Why can’t I make my voice heard?” he said on Friday. “I want to be rid of this stigma I have been unfairly burdened with. Only the Supreme Court can help me.” Kumar had left home on what he calls the ‘Samajik Nyay Yatra (Social Justice March)’ on Tuesday after facing a social boycott in his village, where the idea that he may have embraced Islam was not welcomed. While the ATS later acknowledged he had not actually been converted, he was still seen with suspicion. “Go to Pakistan,” a message on his door had said. On Thursday night, he had stopped at a relative’s house in Dadri on the Muzaffarnagar-Meerut border. Early Friday morning, he was greeted by cops. “A police team from Saharanpur had tracked my phone’s GPS location,” he said. “They found me and, at first, tried to make me give up on my march. They were quite persuasive. When I didn’t listen, they started pressuring me. They would have detained me and forced me to go back.” In the melee that surrounded this, he managed to give police the slip. “But I had to leave my bag with all my belongings behind.” Police said they had indeed approached him on the way. “It is true. We have been trying to counsel him but we are not forcing him. We only tried to help him,” Saharanpur SSP S Chanappa said. But Kumar was not convinced: “What came of that one visit they made? I was labelled a terrorist. They didn’t help then … I began walking after informing the Saharanpur administration. I followed due process. I am doing nothing wrong.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-cops-track-phone-intercept-counsel-man-on-200-km-march-to-sc-ask-him-to-turn-back/articleshow/84903586.cms||Sandeep Rai

In an unusual development, the meeting was held outside the panchayat office after the police locked doors. The local leaders of three political parties — BJP, Congress and Goa Forward — came together to defeat the candidate supported by the local MLA. Sources said that police did not allow anyone to get into the panchayat saying a theft was suspected to have taken place in the office. The lock of the panchayat door was allegedly changed clandestinely to prevent holding the meeting. The matter was raised in the assembly with the opposition alleging that police and goondagiri was being used to prevent the special meeting to be held to oust the sarpanch affiliated to the local MLA.

---||Dehradun||Haridwar industrial hub asks workers to get vaccinated, long queues as centres run out of stock||Haridwar: Vaccine mandates issued by employers in Sidcul, a large industrial hub in Haridwar, have left thousands of contract workers in the lurch, many of whom lined up early morning outside government centres on Friday only to be told several hours later that the “vaccine stocks were over”. TOI visited two major vaccination centres in the city and found tears, anger and desperation as gates were shut and people told to go back. Many refused to leave and police had to disperse them. Lalita Devi, who was among those who could not get the vaccine, was angry that she had lost the day’s pay. She told TOI that she had to leave her two children alone at home to come to the centre. “We are contract workers for a manufacturing factory and get paid for the days we work. My company told us last week that only those who are vaccinated will be allowed inside. Now I will have to come again tomorrow and if I’m not able to get the vaccine, I don’t know how I will rejoin work and feed my family,” said Lalita, who hails from UP’s Bijnor. Another contract worker, Shubham Kumar, said their company was only allowing entry after producing a vaccination certificate. “Yesterday, I went to the vaccination centre in Roshnabad, but after waiting there the entire day, I was told there were no vaccines left. Today, I reached Rishikul vaccination centre early in the morning but there was already a long queue. At 1 pm, they said they had run out of vaccines.” Authorities, however, claimed there was sufficient stock of both Covaxin and Covishield vaccines. Dr Ajay Kumar, additional chief medical officer (Haridwar), told TOI, “There is enough stock in the city, we will check why people were turned away without being vaccinated.” Kumar added that companies in Sidcul will be asked to hold vaccination camps for their workers. The industrial area has over 400 companies that employ more than two lakh contract workers in manufacturing facilities. Most of the workforce is from UP, Bihar and rural areas of Uttarakhand. The chaos at the centres on Friday prompted the district administration to warn companies to withdraw their vaccine requirement. Haridwar district magistrate C Ravishankar told TOI that he was in touch with the employers to do away with the stringent requirement. “We may take action against companies forcing workers to get vaccinated before coming to work,” he said. Sidcul regional manager G S Rawat, a government representative, said that he was in talks with the industrial units to allow workers who are yet to be vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/haridwar-industrial-hub-asks-workers-to-get-vaccinated-long-queues-as-centres-run-out-of-stock/articleshow/84903603.cms||MS Nawaz

CM Pramod Sawant said that the bill for regularisation of houses was passed during the last tenure of the BJP government following which some people became owners of their dwellng house. Sawant said that several cases have been filed against people who do not own the houses they are staying in (ancestral house, alvara land, etc). “The intention of the bill is to benefit Goans,” he said. Intention of bill to benefit Goans: CMSawant said that houses constructed before April 1, 2019, having house number will be given ownership rights. Even encroached government land will be given to the people who have houses on it, he said. He also said that those living in Goa for the last 30 years and having house numbers, electricity or water connections, but have not got ownership of the house, will benefit. ‘Bhumiputra’ means a person who is residing in the state of Goa at least for a period of thirty years before the date of making application under Section 5, and in occupation of a dwelling unit and includes his or her spouse, son, daughter-in-law and unmarried daughter.

The court was hearing the public interest litigation filed by P Gayathri, an agriculturalist seeking to remove the encroachments made in the Thirupachethi South tank in order to facilitate works under the Tamil Nadu Irrigated Agriculture Modernization Project (Neervala Nilavala Thittam). The petitioner stated that the tank, which has two sluices irrigates nearly 330 acres of agricultural lands. Under the project, the bunds of the tank would be strengthened, and the tank desilted. Though the tank was taken up for improvement under the project in 2020, the work is yet to commence due to encroachments. Despite submitting several representations to the authorities, no steps were taken. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking relief. A division bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice T S Sivagnanam directed the petitioner to make a fresh representation in this regard and directed the PWD officials to look into the same and pass appropriate orders after affording opportunities to all parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-remove-encroachment-to-facilitate-new-project/articleshow/84906056.cms||---

Women and children are not even able to walk near many liquor outlets and disturbance is caused to nearby residents due to such outlets, said justice Devan Ramachandran. Long queues are found in front of liquor outlets as Bevco has a monopoly in its trade. Authorities should understand that liquor is not a smuggled item to sell without providing any infrastructure, the court said. The court is considering a contempt of court petition alleging non-implementation of an order issued four years ago to provide adequate infrastructure for selling liquor at Bevco outlets. Criticism from the court, regarding the manner in which liquor is sold, came after the government’s submission that it has decided to relocate 96 liquor outlets that do not have sufficient facilities. In an interim order, the court asked the government to take action regarding these shops and said, “Needless to say, the respondents (excise commissioner, Bevco MD, and other officials) must properly evaluate the other remaining shops and make sure that they do not, in any manner, cause any obstruction or nuisance to any other persons, on account of its functioning.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sell-liquor-decently-hc-tells-govt/articleshow/84906068.cms||---

Despite seeing her colleague, deputy manager Yogita Vartak, lying in a pool of blood and being grievously injured herself, the 32-year-old pressed the security alarm and shouted out for help, alerting locals on the road. Seeing Dubey, a former manager with the bank, fleeing with two bags, two women and a man managed to nab him and hand him over to police. Devrukhkar and Vartak (34) were working till late when Dubey (35) barged in and threatened the women. He forced them to open the lockers and emptied them of gold and cash. When the women tried to raise an alarm, he slashed them with a razor. While Vartak succumbed to her injuries on the spot, Devrukhkar is recuperating in hospital. Ex-mgr plotted heist as he had over Rs 1 crore loansUnder mounting pressure to clear his loans, a former manager of ICICI Bank’s Virar (East) branch plotted a robbery at the bank on Thursday evening. During interrogation, Anil Dubey, who was caught with the over Rs3 crore booty, has confessed that he committed the crime as he had taken loans of over Rs 1 crore from three banks and had to pay monthly instalments of Rs 1.2 lakh. He had worked at the bank between January 2019 and August 2020 before joining as branch head of another private sector bank in Naigaon. He was terminated from his job on Friday. Dubey, who barged into the bank on Thursday, threatned the two women employees who were working till late and robbed cash and gold from the lockers. He slashed the women with a razor, leaving one dead and one grievously injured. After being nabbed Dubey told police his accomplice had escaped. However, cashier Shraddha Devrukhkar, who is recuperating at Sanjeevani Hospital in Virar, told police he had come alone. His car was found at a distance from the bank. Dubey knew the two women and was aware they would be working till late due to month-end accounting work. He had planned to threaten the women and escape with the loot. But when deputy manager Yogita Vartak resisted, he pulled out a razor and slashed her neck. She collapsed on the floor and was later declared dead on arrival at a hospital. Dubey then charged toward Devrukhkar and slashed her on the neck as well. Mira Bhayander Vasai Virar Commissionerate commissioner Sadananad Date visited Devrukhkar and applauded her for her courage. Vartak, a resident of Phoolpada in Virar (east), had been with the Virar branch for the past few years. Police said hours before the crime, Dubey had called her up to inquire about work. Vartak is survived by her husband and a seven-year-old son. Devrukhkar, a resident of Gokul Township in Virar (west), is unable to speak due to her injuries. The mother of one has been communicating using sign language. Relatives said she was in a state of shock after having seen Vartak, with whom she shared a good rapport, in a pool of blood. Dubey has been booked for murder, attempt to murder and robbery. He has been remanded in police custody for a week. Date also felicitated the two women and a man who helped nab Dubey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bank-cashier-raised-alarm-despite-serious-injuries-helped-nab-robber/articleshow/84910112.cms||Sandhya Nair

In a year scores were tabulated based on students’ performance in Class XII internal exams and results in previous years, schools in Goa saw the number of its students with over 90% score shoot up. So far, one of the highest known scorers in the state at Class XII CBSE for 2021 was from the Navy Children’s School in Chicalim.

Kudos to the CBSE for rolling out the results in record time in spite of a year which saw no board exams due to the pandemic. Last few days, till July 25, 2021, teachers and results compilation committees were working overtime in tandem with the Board to see to it that the results are declared in a fair manner,” said principal Anupama Mehra. Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Canacona, too, recorded cent per cent results with all 47 of its students clearing the exam. Of these, 46 got a distinction and the average score was 87.6%.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Higher Covid risk at weddings than in political gatherings?’||AHMEDABAD: With the state government fixing a cap of 150 guests for weddings and a cap of 400 participants for political and other social gatherings as per the revised guidelines, hoteliers and caterers are questioning the reasoning behind the decision. The revised notification allows a miniscule increase of 50 persons allowed at weddings, said hoteliers. “We do not understand the logic. Does Covid-19 risk increase at wedding gatherings and not at politicial and social events? The entire wedding industry, which provides employent to lakhs of people across the state, has suffered a lot already due to Covid restrictions. If the curbs are not eased and relief is not provided, we will only suffer more losses,” said Narendra Somani, president of Hotels and Restaurants’ Association – Gujarat. A number of ancillary businesses such as apparel, jewellery, outdoor caterers, decorators, florists, among others get a big boost due to weddings. “Weddings in India are usually grand affairs. People spend a lot during this time. With reduced cap, the spending in these sectors will reduce and further slow down the industry’s revival,” Somani further added. Echoing a similar view, Paresh Desai, managing director of a catering company, said, “Caterers have been suffering for the past 15 months and their business is down by 90%. With a smaller crowd, margins get thin in catering business. This will impact revenue inflow. We hope the government considers the plight of our business and revises the decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/higher-covid-risk-at-weddings-than-in-political-gatherings/articleshow/84906057.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Upset over scaling down of marks to reference year: CBSE XII high scorers||MUMBAI: CBSE on Friday announced Class XII results of close to 13 lakh students, much to the disappointment of high scorers who said their marks were scaled down. The all-India success rate was 99.37% and Maharashtra’s 99.41%. Despite their disappointment, there was an 81% jump in 95%-plus scorers to 70,004 students across the country from 38,686 last year, which itself was a 55% increase from 2019. A labourer’s daughter, Ansuiya, a Humanities student of Vidya Gyan Bulandshahr, a free residential school by the Shiv Nadar Foundation for economically underprivileged meritorious students from rural Uttar Pradesh, emerged the topper with the perfect 100%. Ansuiya aspires to be an IAS officer. The results of 65,184 students, including from around 1,050 new schools, are under process and will be declared by August 5. A number of schools in Mumbai, too, did not get their results on Friday. In all, 58 Kendriya Vidyalaya schools of Mumbai had a total of 4,234 candidates in Class XII—their success rate was 99.98%, up from the previous year’s 94.9%. While girls did better than boys by 0.5%, transgender students had a 100% success rate this year compared with 66.7% last year and 83.3% in 2019. Thiruvananthapuram region continued to top among the 16 regions in the country with 99.89%. Pune region carved out last year maintained its 10th position this year too. Till 2019, Maharashtra was in the Chennai region. Principals told TOI about having to scale down marks of high scorers. “High scorers felt they could have done better in a written exam. Above-average students benefited the most with the marking system adopted by the board,” said one. CBSE examination head Sanyam Bharadwaj told TOI, “I know a lot of heads of schools had to scale down their results to be in line with their best reference year. I also feel schools have done a lot of hard work. But our decision was appropriate and the performance of schools across India has improved.” Schools were given a reference year— 2018, 2019 or 2020— to evaluate students. “We had an extremely bright student in the subject ‘entrepreneurship’. Last year, our reference year, there was no top scorer for entrepreneurship, so this year’s student lost marks,” said a principal. Nikita Bajaj, principal of R N Podar School, said, “Scaling down the results to bring them on par with the reference year was tough for teachers as we had some exceptionally bright students. For instance, while our reference year was 2018, it was when we also shifted from elective English to core English. So, we felt students would have done better if we had our own reference year for that subject.” Her school had 207 candidates or 44% students with over 90%. Across Ryan Group of Schools, 144 students or 28% of the total strength across Mumbai and Navi Mumbai scored over 90%. Some said it was the best solution considering the pandemic. “If continued performance of a child over three academic sessions is brought into the mainstream, students will give a more focused and improved performance instead of waiting for one exam,” said Madhu Singh, principal, Billabong High International School, Malad. In Mumbai, eight schools’ results were not declared, including four new ones. Schools awaiting results include Kendriya Vidyalaya in Powai, Somaiya School, New Bombay City School, Radcliffe School, Kharghar, and Datta Meghe World Academy.

The court was hearing the public interest litigation filed by K N Subramanian, president of the Madurai Karpaga Nagar Nagarathar Sangam seeking the authorities not to install the electric gasifier crematorium inside the Pudukulam kanmoi. A division bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice T S Sivagnanam observed that the revenue records reveal that some parts of the area are shown as a waterbody where RTO and other government offices were constructed some 30 years ago. There is also a crematorium in the area and the corporation commissioner submitted that it is pursuant to the appeal of local residents that the less polluting variant of a gasifier is proposed to be installed in the existing crematorium. The judges observed that even if it has to be now accepted that waterbody that once existed may no longer be there and other constructions have come up, every attempt should be made for installing a gasifier beyond the boundaries of the remaining portion of waterbody, even though water does not collect there any longer. The judges observed that it will also be open to the corporation to consider the location of the crematoria beyond residential areas. Though there can be no denial that the pollution would be controlled, the foul stench can never be gotten rid of. The judges directed the corporation commissioner to file a report on where it proposes to install the gasifier and adjourned the case to August 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-seeks-report-in-plea-against-gasifier-crematorium-in-waterbody/articleshow/84906035.cms||---
---||Madurai||PM urged to set up Archaeological Survey of India epigraphy branch in Tamil Nadu||MADURAI: A group of epigraphists have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking establishment of an epigraphy branch in the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Total 758 posts were recently created at ASI, but epigraphy branch was not part of it, which is shocking, the epigraphists and historians said. Historians, archaeologists and epigraphists including historian and professor A V Narasima Murthy from Mysore, Dr D Raja Reddy, an epigraphist from Coimbatore, professor S Rajavelu from Chennai and professor Susmitha Majumdar stated that India is a repository for rich epigraphical wealth. There is no Indian history without epigraphy as is the only source for understanding the true history and culture of Indian people, they said. General Alexander Cunningham, who led the ASI when it was established in the year 1861, was also instrumental in the establishment of a separate epigraphy branch in 1886. So far, 74,000 inscriptions have been copied from across the country. However, only 50% of the inscriptions have been published in departmental publications due to lack of sufficient workforce. Many original inscriptions, which were copied, are being destroyed in the name of development. They stated in the letter that they have to save the ancient Indian historical data. At present, the directorate of epigraphy is functioning with only 25 sanctioned technical posts (epigraphists) at four different levels. Two separate director posts should be created for Dravidian and Sanskrit inscriptions, they wrote in the letter. As many as 122 epigraphical posts including superintending epigraphist, deputy superintending epigraphist and assistant epigraphist should be created, they have said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/pm-urged-to-set-up-asi-epigraphy-branch/articleshow/84906060.cms||---

The exams were to be held from May 4 to June 14 for the 14.3 lakh registered students, including private and repeat candidates. While the exams were cancelled for regular students on June 1, a decision on 60,443 private and repeat students was put on hold. While CBSE decided to assess regular students based on three years’ performance, private students were told to appear for physical exams to be held from August 16 to September 15. Students said it is unfair to make them write physical exams when the pandemic conditions are the same for all. Last week, private students protested with placards outside the CBSE headquarters in Delhi. CBSE in a circular has stated that private students will have to take written exams as there is no data available to evaluate them. Students, though, said their data is available both with the board and their schools. “By the time our results are out, admission to degree courses will be over and we would have wasted a year,” said a private candidate. Private students had filed a review petition in Supreme Court seeking cancellation of their class XII exams. CBSE had told the court exams for private students will be held in a manner that will fall within the assessment policy for the academic year 2019-2020 as approved by the court last year. The Maharashtra board is assessing private students on a 50:50 ratio for Class X and XII. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pvt-repeat-students-protest-seek-cancellation-of-offline-exams-in-aug/articleshow/84908351.cms||Sandhya Nair

Congress and BJP councillors shouted slogans and rushed towards the mayor after a Congress councillor said that remdesivir and ventilator thieves should not be allowed to speak. This led to a major uproar with the BJP demanding an apology from the Danilimda councillor, Shehzadkhan Pathan. The BJP office bearers stated that they would not allow the board meeting to continue till Pathan apologized. This led to arguments after which the Congress councillors tore up the agenda of the meeting and rushed towards the chair of the mayor. The BJP councillors also rushed towards the mayor and he was escorted out of the hall with the help of secrity personnel. Both BJP and Congress councillors then shouted slogans against each other. The Behrampura councillor Kamla Chavda while speaking during the board meeting alleged that the BJP was raising the treatment cost at SVP Hospital, making it difficult for poor people to get treatment. She said that patients were not admitted to the hospital if they did not come in 108 ambulances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/uproar-at-amc-general-board-meeting/articleshow/84906099.cms||---

According to police, the girl from the woman’s first marriage is in Class IX. The girl was staying with the mother and her second husband. The woman had an affair with another youth, suspected to be a tipper lorry driver, from Haripad. This person visited the girl’s house often. Last week, the mother agreed to her lover’s demand of taking the girl to his place along with another friend. The two men picked up the girl on a two-wheeler near the house and later continued the journey in a bus. They changed buses before reaching a house where she was abused. Meanwhile, the woman’s second husband filed a complaint with Aranmula police about the missing girl. The next day, the girl was dropped back home by the mother’s lover. The abuse was revealed when the police spoke with the girl. Since the men changed buses on their way, the girl is not sure about the location of the house where she was abused. Police suspect that the lover has given a fake identity to the woman. Police have begun a search for the two men.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/woman-arrested-for-letting-lover-abuse-minor-daughter/articleshow/84906118.cms||---

For the past one week, a massive crackdown has been launched on this junkyard where stolen cars are brought from all over NCR and other neighbouring states and dismantled by expert mechanics in no time. Additional superintendent of police Suraj Rai said, “In the past one week, we have seized at least 30 engines whose chassis numbers had been scrapped and the dealers weren’t able to explain the source. This is besides other parts of the vehicles. We have also sealed 10 godowns and identified 120 mechanics involved in dismantling stolen vehicles. Forty of them have been charged under the Goonda Act while the process is on to book others too.” A dozen of them have been slapped with the Gangster Act. On Thursday night, three arrests were also made. One junk dealer, who didn’t want to be named, told TOI, “Police are treating us as if all traders in this scrap market are criminals. They are coming in hoards and sealing our shops and godowns arbitrarily without even giving us an opportunity to explain. This is injustice. We feel we are being targeted only because 95% of the junk dealers here are from the minority community and they are easy targets in the current regime.” ASP Rai, however, dismissed these allegations. “We asked for documents of the seized vehicle parts. We are concerned with just those auto parts which have no proper documentation.” In November, engines of at least 51 stolen cars, some of them belonging to powerful high-end models, were recovered from warehouses of a notorious car scrap dealer in Meerut, whose sons were booked in June 2020 after a similar cache was found in Lucknow. Police said that most of the cars were stolen from Delhi and NCR districts. Five stolen cars were also found from the residence of Haji Iqbal, a man infamous for shady car dealings which allegedly involved buying stolen vehicles and re-launching them into the market with fake documents. Mohammad Naeem alias Haji Galla, 68, is allegedly the kingpin of the thriving auto spare parts market, where stolen vehicles from Haryana, Uttarakhand and Delhi apart from western UP districts are brought and dismantled immediately. There have been several instances in the past when police teams from other states raided the market and even recovered chassis of stolen vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/massive-crackdown-begins-on-the-notorious-stolen-car-market-12-booked-under-gangster-act-another-40-under-goonda-act/articleshow/84903609.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Kolkata||Kol theatres to wait for new content, dist halls to reopen with old releases||Kolkata: After Bengal allowed cinemas to reopen, city exhibitors have taken a cautious approach keeping Covid numbers and the availability of new content in mind. However, digital cinema distribution networks, including QUBE and UFO, have received requests from many cinemas outside Kolkata to reopen with old releases. Bardhaman Cinema’s owner Madhusudan Das is reopening on Saturday with the 2010 Dev-Srabanti-starrer ‘Shedin Dekha Hoyechilo’. “That film is already loaded on QUBE Cinemas. So, I can play it,” Das said. Arunava Das, operations manager, QUBE, said some 10 theatres in the districts will start operations from Sunday with old films. “Rupkatha (Habra) will screen ‘Tangra Blues’ (2021) and ‘Paran Jai Jaliya Re’ (2009). Purbasha (Maslandapur) has asked for ‘Shesh Theke Shuru’ (2019) and Surendra (Ranaghat) wants to screen ‘Ei Ami Renu’ (2021). Sarama (Barasat) wants ‘Mon Mane Na’ (2008) while Prantik (Tehatta) wants to show ‘Romeo’ (2011),” he said. Rajkamal Chourasia, manager of Arti Cinema Pvt Ltd which is the regional dealer of UFO Cine Network Mumbai, said, “On Saturday, Bhawani (Cooch Behar) will screen ‘Mayurakshi’ (2017) and ‘Bindaas’ (2014). New Cinema (Siliguri) will screen ‘Awara’ (2012) and a Hindi dubbed movie titled ‘Vinash Kaal’ (2020).” However, single screen owners in Kolkata have not made such requests. Meanwhile, director Raj Chakraborty is wondering if there could be a “political agenda” behind the dip in momentum of some city exhibitors, who had campaigned to reopen. “They had even pointed at how Uttar Pradesh government had allowed cinemas to reopen while Bengal was taking time. Our government supports Tollywood and I wonder why a reference to UP was given. It will be harmful for Tollywood if some have tried to use this issue for political gains,” he said. Chakraborty pointed at the circulation of messages accusing members of Tollywood who are MPs and MLAs for not advocating the cause of reopening cinemas in Bengal. “We don’t take these calls. There is a raging pandemic and only experts can decide on it. Yet, I always forwarded these requests to our CM. Didi wanted us to be patient since health issues have been a concern. Now that the order is out, producers should be allowed to decide on when to release their content,” he added. Soon after the notification on Thursday, a producer called up a reputed director to discuss their contract that had mentioned mandatory theatrical release of their new Bengali film that had already been sold to a TV channel. But, the director didn’t insist on theatrical release. He didn’t want to burden the producer with the cost of a print, publicity and theatrical release that would run into Rs 20 lakh when there is a slim chance of recovery of investment. “My theatre is in running condition and am ready to open provided we get suitable programmes to play. But I can’t insist when a producer will release his film,” said Navina owner Navin Choukhani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-theatres-to-wait-for-new-content-dist-halls-to-reopen-with-old-releases/articleshow/84906126.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Restrictions within 10km buffer from Thane sanctuary to affect bldg projects||Mumbai: Construction restrictions within a 10km buffer zone from the boundary of the eco-sensitive Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary are likely to affect real estate projects in large parts of Greater Mumbai. A recent circular issued by the development plan (DP) department of the BMC has sent shock waves in the construction industry. The circular, a copy of which was made available to TOI, said it will now be mandatory for builders within this zone to take prior construction permission from the National Board of Wildlife. Environmentalists say the buffer zone should not be looked as 'anti-development'. Projects in 15 wards in Mumbai are covered within the 10km buffer zone, according to the BMC circular. Suburban wards include areas like Kurla (L), Chembur (M East and M West), Bhandup (S), Mulund (T), Ghatkopar-East (N), Kandivli, Borivli, Dahisar, Andheri-East and Bandra-East. Island city areas include Dadar (G North), Matunga (F North) and Parel (F South). Vinod Chitore, who heads the BMC’s DP department, said builders whose projects fall under the buffer zone will first have to get clearance from the forest department before their plans are approved by his department. "We hear that the Union environment ministry is expected to reduce the buffer zone, but so far there is nothing on record and this circular will apply till then," he told TOI. The BMC circular referred to a letter from the deputy forest conservator, Thane division, stating that prior permission is required for all development/construction works falling within the 10km buffer zone. Builder Deepak Goradia, president of Credai-MCHI, said that as per a December 2018 Supreme Court order, the 10km buffer should be applicable to all forest sanctuaries where the state has not decided eco- sensitive boundaries. He said states were given the liberty to finalise and revise the buffer zones. "Last March, the Maharashtra government finalised the eco-sensitive boundaries to 3.89km and sent the proposal file to Delhi. The Union environment ministry called for objections and suggestions and the 60-day period got over in June. We are awaiting the final notification from the Centre,’’ said Goradia. A leading Mumbai developer said, "The necessary conditions of the Supreme Court order of 2018 have been complied with and the boundary distance has been published already. This sudden BMC circular will have a huge negative impact on over three lakh migrant workers who have only just returned to Mumbai and on projects worth more than Rs 5 lakh crore. The authorities must resolve the matter since such sudden shocks have a huge negative impact on investor and buyer sentiment." Environmentalist D Stalin said, "It only means that constructions that involve extensive destruction of nature will face hurdles. But even those will be cleared case to case using proper mitigation measures. Right, now all builders have a free run without any safeguards or mitigation in place. The ecological areas inside the buffer will get protection. Construction is not banned, its regulated." "The ministry had invited objections and suggestions to the draft notifications and these have been forwarded to us. We shall now be adding our remarks to objections/suggestions and placing it before the expert appraisal committee of the MoEFCC for a final decision. A meeting is scheduled for the second week of August," said Virendra Tiwari of the Mangrove Conservation Cell. The final notification declaring 16.9 sq km as a flamingo sanctuary was issued in 2018. It is one of the mitigation measures for the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-restrictions-within-10km-buffer-from-thane-sanctuary-to-affect-bldg-projects/articleshow/84910137.cms||---

Kamal Malik, the BJP MLA from Garhmukteshwar, who was on a ‘padyatra’ to a village in Hapur’s Nanai area ahead of next year's assembly polls, was dragged into a waterlogged lane to "check for himself". In a minute-long viral video, Ravindra Kumar, husband of a village pradhan, can be seen pulling a reluctant Malik towards the lane - full of sewage water - with others jeering him. A few locals can be also heard purportedly saying, "Drag him into the water. Look, this is our MLA walking in sewage water because he hasn’t done any work here." Others called for the MLA's ‘samman samaroh’ boycott. Some left the event mid-way while others quizzed him on the work he promised in 2017 while "seeking votes". The MLA never returned here after his election campaign in 2017, claimed one villager. When contacted, Ravindra Kumar told TOI that the MLA himself had expressed interest to see the "real condition of the village" and so he showed him around. “Such things should not have happened. Ex-pradhan was also involved. I asked the MLA to support me so that I can address the villagers' main issues,” Kumar said on Friday. The MLA, on the other hand, claimed that no one boycotted his event or raised any slogans. “I wanted to feel the pain of the villagers. Hence, I walked through the flooded lane. The video is being misused and blown out of context. I have taken up the matter with the local administration and asked them to find an immediate solution,” the MLA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/irked-with-flooded-lanes-villagers-drag-mla-to-walk-him-through-sewage-water/articleshow/84903671.cms||Ishita Mishra

On Thursday morning the landslide at the mine continued to carry the overflow and wash-off of monsoon water mixed along with the silt. This has affected the 15 MLD (million litres per day) water treatment plant of Chandel, forcing officials to stop pumping raw water for the entire day. Lok Sabha MP Vinayak Raut who represents the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg constituency along with additional collector of Sindhudurg Mangesh Joshi and the tahsildar of Dodamarg Arun Khanolkar visited Kalane and instructed officials of the mine to take measures to stop the run-off entering low-lying areas. Assistant engineer of PWD at Chandel, Balaji Phadte, told TOI, “Today the quantum of sediment in the raw water has been minimised. Our chemists have taken samples and found water usable for treatment. We are waiting for the report of the raw water samples sent to the laboratory in Panaji. As soon as this report is available we will start pumping water.” The mining sediment in raw water of the Kalane river has been responsible for clogging of the sand filters, which has affected the running of the plant. In order to make such polluted water fit for human consumption, additional energy and time is required for treatment of turbidity. Residents of Pernem taluka who rely on the Chandel plant have expressed apprehension about water pollution repeatedly caused due to the Kalane mine and have urged the Goa government to take steps to prevent such incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/water-supply-to-pernem-still-affected-by-dodamarg-landslide/articleshow/84908397.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

---||Thane||Thane: FIR against Param Bir Singh for extorting Rs 5 crore from bookies||THANE: Thane police on Friday registered a fourth case against IPS officer Param Bir Singh along with former encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma, erstwhile deputy commissioner Deepak Devraj and gangster Ravi Pujari on a complaint by bookies Ketan Tanna and Sonu Jalan that the policemen had extorted nearly Rs 5 crore from them in 2018. In all, 28 persons, including eight policemen, are charged with extortion, assault, criminal intimidation, criminal conspiracy, robbery under the Indian Penal Code and Arms Act. Other policemen named are assistant commissioner NT Kadam, inspector Rajkumar Kothmire, one assistant sub inspector and two constables. Another individual named here is Binu Varghese. “There are other private persons among the accused including collection agent Vikas Dabhade, Bimal Agrawal, his wife, brother, Bacchi Singh, others who worked with the officers to extort money,” said Jalan. “In my complaint, I gave a detailed account of how Param Bir Singh had demanded Rs 10 crore inside his cabin and I had given Rs 3 crore and Tanna had given Rs 1.18 crore. Also, another case was filed against me in 2017 and they had taken Rs 40 lakh then,” he said. Singh was Thane police commissioner at the time of the incident, while Sharma and Kothmire were attached to the Thane anti-extortion cell. In 2018, Thane police had claimed that Jalan took the help of gangster Ravi Pujari in recovering money placed on bets from one Ritesh Shah and arrested him, Ketan Tanna and other bookies. However, a state CID probe conducted after Param Bir Singh was shifted out from the Mumbai police chief’s post found substance in Jalan’s allegations. The CID submitted its report to DGP Sanjay Pandey last Friday, said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-fir-against-param-bir-for-extorting-rs-5cr-from-bookies/articleshow/84908385.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

---||Ahmedabad||City gas distribution companies oppose bid to change network exclusivity||AHMEDABAD: A recent proposal of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) which could change the rules for exclusivity in a city gas distribution (CGD) network has been opposed by incumbent and new entrants to the sector, including foreign investors. The move, if implemented, could give easy access to third-party companies and derail planned investment in the sector by existing CGD companies. The regulator came out with a public notice a month ago, where it sought the views of stakeholders on the interpretation of network exclusivity, establishment and operation of LNG stations as well as supply of natural gas including LNG by any entity through virtual mode, by cascades or any other mode other than pipeline, in an authorized geographical area. An open house in this regard was held on July 29 where various stakeholders opposed the move, said sources privy to the development. Many CGD companies that have submitted their response to the regulator are of the view that supply of CGD including LNG can only be done by authorized CGD entities according to the PNGRB Act and Regulations. AGP CGD India Pvt Ltd, a subsidiary of Singapore-based AG&P Group in its submission to PNGRB stated that taking a contrary view to its own views/actions in the past, the regulator would only protect the interest of a handful of industrial customers and a few suppliers but eventually derail the whole purpose of the introduction of CGD authorization. “Any deviation by PNGRB shall only be made, keeping in mind, the viability of large scale of investments made or committed and the framework on which the bidding process took place in the ninth and tenth round,” said AGP, which has investors from Japan, Philippines, Middle East, United States and others. As the proposed issue outlined in the public notice encourages “cherry-picking” of customer segments by a handful suppliers, authorized CNG entities will be left with scattered pockets of demand, defeating the whole of purpose of holistic development of CGD networks across the country and making India a gas-based economy, said an industry expert. Companies including Indraprastha Gas Ltd, Mahanagar Gas Ltd, Gujarat Gas, Adani Total Gas Ltd, Torrent Gas and few others have stated that there was no ambiguity in the way exclusivity has been dealt with in the PNGRB Act and regulations. They said in their submissions that any business which does not use the CGD network as defined in the Act, including supply of LNG by trucks or any other means, is outside the purview of authorization given to CGD entities. Gujarat being the most developed market, CGD companies in the state would be severely affected if third party companies are allowed to sell LNG through trucks in GA areas, a state government official said. A minimum eight years of exclusivity from the purview of “common carrier or contract carrier” and twenty-five years of exclusivity for laying, building or expansion of the CGD network must be protected, said the Association of CGD Entities. “We also submit that any change in regulation or policy will have to be only prospective (i.e. will be covered for GAs in the next bid round) and cannot impact existing geographical areas whose exclusivity is still ongoing,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cgd-cos-oppose-bid-to-change-exclusivity/articleshow/84906241.cms||Maulik Pathak

The state gave an oral assurance that no coercive action will be taken against Pathan, accused in an extortion case along with former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh till then. On Thursday, a high court bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar had asked the state how it filed an FIR against a serving police officer (Pathan) without a preliminary inquiry, as laid down under law. His counsel, Niteen Pradhan, said police had not followed proper procedure. The Special Investigation Team probing the Singh case should have conducted an inquiry based on the findings. His petition contends that the IPS officer, “with an unblemished career’’ for over 14 years, was doing his duty and has denied the allegations of corruption.

The suspects demanded the money from the owner of the restaruant-lodge between July 26 and 28. “The suspects had initially demanded Rs 50,000 extortion money from the lodge owner — Gopal Pujari (41) of Koregaon Bhima. But, he did not respond,” said Rajendra Mokashi of the Loni Kalbhor police on Friday. “Later, the suspects visited Pujari again and demanded Rs10,000 extortion money per month from him,” he added.

Archana Yugal, a BA student, was stabbed in the chest and her throat slit right outside Dataganj police station in Budaun on Wednesday night. Both her brothers were arrested immediately after the attack while her father and his twin brother were arrested on Friday and all were sent to jail. They were charged under section 302 (murder) on the complaint of Archana’s husband, Devendra Kumar. After their arrest, Archana’s brothers had told the police that she had brought the family “dishonour”. Archana’s family has been written about because her mother had married twins, Kunwarpal Singh and Chandrapal Singh, after both fell for her. Archana’s father’s cousin, Devendra Kumar, who lived in the same village, would often call on her family. He and Archana fell in love. But the relationship was taboo. Anticipating resistance from both families, they ran away to Bareilly on June 22 and got married at a temple there. For nearly a week, Archana’s family looked for her. On June 30, her elder brother, Ravit Kumar, filed a complaint at the Dataganj police station against Devendra and three of his family members, accusing them of abduction. When Archana and Devendra got to know, they sought protection from the Allahabad high court. The plea was granted. When the couple returned to Dataganj and approached police with the order, they were attacked by Archana’s family members. Senior cops suspect that the information about their arrival was leaked by someone at the police station. Sankalp Sharma, Budaun’s SSP, told TOI, “All the four accused named in the FIR have been arrested and sent to jail. We have provided protection to the woman's husband. An internal inquiry is on to find the person who leaked the information about the couple to the accused.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/honour-killing-father-his-twin-bro-arrested-for-murder-of-woman-outside-police-station/articleshow/84903766.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

A total of 241 visitors are stranded in Udaipur, which include some local residents who are stuck on other sides of the flooded nullahs since Tuesday 8pm. The list of tourists include 15 from Punjab, two from UP, three from Odisha, four from Delhi, three from Maharashtra, two from Haryana and one each from Ladakh, Karnataka and Jharkhand, apart from 209 persons from different parts of Himachal. Nearly 150 people, including local residents and some tourists, were evacuated with the help of ladders and ropes on Friday. Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur’s proposed visit to Lahaul to conduct aerial survey of flood-hit area was suspended due to inclement weather conditions on Friday. The elderly, women, children and sick people were proposed to be airlifted from Udaipur to Sissu helipad from where they had to be shifted to Manali by road. The chopper is now expected to reach Lahaul on Saturday. While many local people risked their lives to cross the swollen nullahs in the last two days, authorities too have started establishing makeshift crossings. A few people were washed away in the flooded Jahlma nullah while trying to cross it along with a road accident victim who was tied to a stretcher. The fast flow of the nullah swept away the helping people, who somehow managed to come out of the waters. However, one person was swept for about 10 meters. Lahaul-Spiti deputy commissioner Neeraj Kumar said relief works were continuing on war footings. “Some people were rescued on Friday. Others will also be rescued soon. All tourists are safe at Udaipur. Administration has arranged for their stay and meal. The government shall try to airlift the women, children and sick people on priority,” he said. It may take some days to restore traffic on Keylong-Udaipur-Kishtwar road. Border Roads Organisation (BRO) official said they are making alternative arrangements to reconnect the road temporarily at damaged portions. Water level in some nullahs is still very high and connecting road was not possible. Cabinet minister Ram Lal Markanda, who is leading the relief operations in Lahaul, said, jhoola (makeshift ropeways) were being established over the nullahs, including Jahlma and Shansha, to facilitate safe crossing for people. “One such jhoola has is ready over Shansha nullah.” The CM’s helicopter is scheduled to conduct some sorties from Bhuntar in Kullu to Lahaul and will airlift the stranded tourists. However, the sortie will depend on weather conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/over-150-visitors-stranded-in-lahaul-for-three-days/articleshow/84908461.cms||---

Local residents protested alleging foul play in the incident when police arrived. Priya was in a live-in relationship with Saji, an autorickshaw driver from Thuravoor. Saji would only occasionally stay in the house since he had a wife and children, police said. Priya left her family a few years ago to be with Saji. They had been living on rent at several places and had come to the present house seven months ago. Both had a fight two weeks ago, and later Saji tested positive for Covid. The deceased left notes for Saji, her father and also the woman friend.

A recent circular issued by the development plan (DP) department of the BMC has sent shock waves in the construction industry. The circular, a copy of which was made available to TOI, said it will now be mandatory for builders within this zone to take prior construction permission from the National Board of Wildlife. Environmentalists say the buffer zone should not be looked as ‘anti-development’. TimesViewIt is vital to strike a balance between environmental protection and development. The buffer zone around the Thane bird sanctuary is essential but extending it to 10km could affect hundreds of construction projects in Mumbai. The Thane forest dept must only ensure that no green cover is destroyed around the sanctuary. Extending the buffer zone to areas like Dadar and Kurla makes little sense.Projects in 15 wards in Mumbai are covered within the 10km buffer zone, according to the BMC circular. Suburban wards include areas such as Kurla (L), Chembur (M East and M West), Bhandup (S), Mulund (T), Ghatkopar-East (N), Kandivli, Borivli, Dahisar, Andheri-East and Bandra-East. Island city areas include Dadar (G North), Matunga (F North) and Parel (F South). Vinod Chitore, who heads the BMC’s DP department, said builders whose projects fall under the buffer zone will first have to get clearance from the forest department before their plans are approved by his department. Bird sanctuary restrictions shock builders, satisfy greensBuilders and environmentalists seem to have opposing points of view on construction restrictions within a 10km buffer zone from the boundary of the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary. Builder Deepak Goradia, president of Credai-MCHI, said that as per a December 2018 Supreme Court order, the 10km buffer should be applicable to all forest sanctuaries where the state has not decided eco-sensitive boundaries. He said states were given the liberty to finalise and revise the buffer zones. “Last March, the Maharashtra government finalised the ecosensitive boundaries to 3.89km and sent the proposal file to Delhi. The Union environment ministry called for objections and suggestions and the 60-day period got over in June. We are awaiting the final notification from the Centre,’’ said Goradia. Vinod Chitore, who heads the BMC’s DP department, said, “We hear that the Union environment ministry is expected to reduce the buffer zone, but so far there is nothing on record and this circular will apply till then.” The BMC circular referred to a letter from the deputy forest conservator, Thane division, stating that prior permission is required for all development/construction works falling within the 10km buffer zone. leading Mumbai developer said, “The necessary conditions of the Supreme Court order of 2018 have been complied with and the boundary distance has been published already. This sudden BMC circular will have a huge negative impact on over three lakh migrant workers who have only just returned to Mumbai and on projects worth more than Rs 5 lakh crore. The authorities must resolve the matter since such sudden shocks have a huge negative impact on investor and buyer sentiment.” Environmentalist D Stalin said, “It only means that constructions that involve extensive destruction of nature will face hurdles. But even those will be cleared case to case using proper mitigation measures. Right, now all builders have a free run without any safeguards or mitigation in place. The ecological areas inside the buffer will get protection. Construction is not banned, it’s regulated.” “The ministry had invited objections and suggestions to the draft notifications and these have been forwarded to us. We shall now be adding our remarks to objections/ suggestions and placing it before the expert appraisal committee of the MoEFCC for a final decision. A meeting is scheduled for the second week of August,” said Virendra Tiwari of the Mangrove Conservation Cell. The final notification declaring 16.9 sq km as a flamingo sanctuary was issued in 2018. It is one of the mitigation measures for the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/10km-buffer-zone-for-thane-creek-sanctuary-may-hit-city-bldg-projects/articleshow/84912140.cms||Nauzer K Bharucha
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Surendra Gadling granted interim bail on ‘humanitarian grounds’||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday granted interim bail to Elgar Parishad case accused Surendra Gadling (51) from August 13 to 21 to go to Nagpur and complete the last rituals of his mother on the occasion of her first death anniversary on August 15, “on humanitarian grounds”. He had been denied permission by the special NIA court last September. The HC said Gadli-ng’s claim that the last rites and condolence meeting “kept in abeyance, are to be performed and held on the first death anniversary of his mother cannot be said to be impracticable or untenable.” The HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar said the NIA court had not approached the issue from the humanitarian consideration. “In the prevailing social construct, the first death anniversary of an immediate family member has an element of religious, personal and emotional significance. Admittedly, the appellant has not been able to participate in any of the rites or rituals in connection with the death of his mother. Viewed through this prism, we do not find the prayer of the appellant unjustifiable,” the bench said. The high court also found “some substance” in senior counsel Indira Jaising’s submissions that Gadling, a practising lawyer, does not pose any “flight risk”. Jaising said that Gadling had been searched by Pune police on April 17, 2018, over 40 days prior to his arrest and “he did not make himself scarce or avoid to cooperate with the investigation agency.” He was arrested on June 6, 2018, and has not been granted bail since. The HC said though there is no reasonable ground to believe Gadling may abscond, it set strict conditions of reporting to Nagpur police on his arrival and also on August 16 and 19 and not leave Nagpur, except to visit Bina river to immerse the ashes of his mother on August 18. Gadling must hand over his passport to the NIA and surrender to Taloja prison superintendent on August 21 at 6pm. No extension plea would be entertained, said the HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/gadling-granted-interim-bail-on-humanitarian-grounds-in-mumbai/articleshow/84910163.cms||Swati Deshpande

The Goa Football Association had invited the top five clubs in the Goa Professional League to register their interest in the I-League qualifiers, before Saturday’s deadline. The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has asked state associations to nominate a maximum of two teams from the state with one team – league winner – getting preference. If the league winner cannot fulfil the club licensing criteria, the second team will be considered. Only Vasco Sports Club, which finished fifth in the Pro League, have written to the GFA. “We have submitted our bid before the deadline. Now it is up to the GFA to nominate us,” Vasco’s director of football Ravish Narvekar told TOI on Saturday. Goa’s oldest football club has aspirations to return to the national fold after more than a decade. They were relegated from the I-League in 2010. Pro League champions Sporting Clube de Goa, Dempo SC and Salgaocar FC, all three powerhouses of Indian football, have no interest in the I-League. The three clubs had pulled out of the I-League in 2016, citing AIFF’s roadmap. The Covid-19 pandemic has made it even more difficult. Churchill Brothers are Goa’s sole representatives in the I-League. Five-times national league champions Dempo had qualified from the Second Division the very year they opted to pull out from the top-tier. Since then, they have been linked to a return to the I-League, but fans will have to wait a little longer. “I wish to inform you that due to the uncertainties caused by the pandemic, Dempo Sports Club is not interested in participating for the AIFF second division qualifiers this season (2021-22),” Dempo general secretary Patwin Fizardo informed GFA. “However, if an opportunity for the same arises next season (2022-23), kindly let us know.” Should they get the nod, Vasco, coached by former international Micky Fernandes, will have little time to prepare for the qualifiers in September. With former internationals Francis Fernandes and Joaquim Abranches, Vasco started last season’s Pro League on the front foot and were even leading the table for some time, until they settled for the fifth spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vasco-show-interest-in-i-league-qualifiers/articleshow/84933015.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||Mumbai||Channel’s portrayal of actor in video ‘transgressing some limits’: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: After hearing Shilpa Shetty’s counsel Birendra Saraf and Abhinav Chandrachud, on the actor’s defmation suit, the Bombay high court said the TV channel’s portrayal of her in a July 26 video “is transgressing some limits…and will need to be taken down”. “I believe some of the issues this suit raise will require closer scrutiny because it is not possible to say at this stage that all statements are of the same defamatory character,” said Justice Gautam Patel, while dictating his order. Saraf, he noted, restricted his urgent pleas to a few from the 20-odd cited. Justice Patel said, “This is not to mean I have rejected his plea with regard to others nor is it to mean that he has conceded his case with regard to others…” Shetty’s Rs 25-crore defamation suit is against 29 parties across online print, electronic and social media—the 29th being a John Doe (unknown person)—to restrain them from posting, reposting, circulating any derogatory and false content in print or audio visual formats and to prevent any further invasion of her privacy. Her application for interim relief alleged it was to increase their viewership and prejudice in people’s minds against her and her husband Raj Kundra during the pendency of an investigation into the pornographic racket. Saraf said one of the parties who have now taken down the content had questioned the quality of her parenting in regard to her children. It was “malicious and defamatory” and a reckless disregard to her fundamental rights as “involving her personal life and that of her children was a clear intrusion in her privacy,” he added. The HC said, “Now, whether this is malicious with reckless disregard for the truth or made knowing to be false are matters that will have to be considered on another day.” “None of this involves or should be allowed to involve Shetty as parent. That aspect of her life is protected by right to privacy,” it said, adding: “He has taken down the video...is not to be uploaded again.” The HC said that the TV channel and the online entertainment channel “seem to me to be even at this ad-interim stage malicious…certainly Shetty has not been contacted for her comments”. Justice Patel, however, passed no observations or orders over another alleged defamatory content on an online portal saying it “directly relates to the investigation” in the case. The HC called for replies from all the defendants by August 18 and a single comprehensive rejoinder from Shetty by August 26. It will hear the matter again on September 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-channels-portrayal-of-actor-in-video-transgressing-some-limits/articleshow/84908500.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Heritage school to get new avatar||AHMEDABAD: Abandoned, unattended, dilapidated and perhaps forgotten since the 2001 earthquake, a 150-year-old heritage school building in the bustling Khamasa area of the walled city of Ahmedabad is all set to be restored. Powered by a state government initiative, Architect duo Manuel M De Las Heras – a Spanish architect and his partner, Sanskriti Panchal, will restore this heritage building of a government high school into an innovation centre for girls. The restoration project is the first case of an adaptive reuse of a government-owned heritage building. The restoration work is expected to be completed within the next two years. On Friday, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between Gujarat Chamber Foundation and LxS Foundation for establishing a Girls Innovation Center in collaboration with the state education department, UNESCO Delhi, Alliance Française d'Ahmedabad and Indian National Trust for Art & Culture (INTACH). “The innovation centre will basically focus on four projects to start with. These include life skill training, sports training and career counselling, and even a scholarship programme that girls can avail. The idea is to enable young girls from underprivileged backgrounds with additional skill sets and access to financial aid,” said Panchal, co-founder, LxS Foundation. “The project also aims at enabling micro entrepreneurs in pols of Ahmedabad through grants,” she added. The idea behind restoring the heritage building and turning it into a functional innovation centre for women is to bring the heritage to its people. “Physical heritage only prevails to future relevance when it represents equality, inclusion and innovation. Our idea is to bring the urban heritage spaces to common citizens. Heritage buildings do not have to be tourist spots but rather places accessible by the local community and therefore, restoring them keeping in mind the aspiration of young generation and needs of the community is inevitable,” said Manuel, who has worked on restoration of heritage buildings and spaces with involvement of local community at Dhal ni Pol. The organisation will reach out to the girls in need through state education department. Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) will fund Rs 15 lakh for the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/heritage-school-to-get-new-avatar/articleshow/84906287.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Bareilly||UP: Schoolboy, 9, dies while enacting hanging scene in Bhagat Singh play||BAREILLY: The final scene of the play Shivam, 9, and his friends were rehearsing for Independence Day celebrations was Bhagat Singh’s hanging. Shivam found a rope, tied a noose around his neck and played the part. But while other schoolboys continued with the play, his feet slipped off the stool he was propping himself up on. He died within minutes. “He hanged himself while playing with the swing,” his aunt Ram Bala said, unable to hold back tears. It was Thursday afternoon, at Babat village in UP’s Budaun. Shivam was home with his younger brother and sister, and his parents, Inderjeet and Aarti, were out working on their paddy fields. He would usually stay at his maternal grandmother’s place in a neighbouring village, where he studied, but he had come home a few days ago. Shivam left home to play with the kids in his village. Independence Day was approaching. “They decided to put on a play for the occasion,” Shivam’s uncle Vinod Kumar said. It would be one on Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, executed by the British colonial administration in 1931 for killing British police official John Saunders. Shivam insisted he would play Bhagat Singh. They came to his house and started rehearsing in the courtyard. When the execution scene had to be enacted, Shivam looked for a rope. The swing would do, he thought, and brought a stool to climb on. He took the swing’s rope, fashioned a noose out of it and put it round his neck. But at some point, his feet went off the stool. He struggled to breathe, as his friends thought he was just acting. “When he got motionless, the kids ran outside, screaming, ‘latak gaya, latak gaya (he has been hanged)’. By the time any of us could get there, it was too late,” Kumar said. “He died.” Shocked beyond measure, his parents cremated him. “It was an accident, so we didn’t go to the police,” Kumar added. In February last year, a 12-year-old boy from Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh had also been accidentally hanged when he was trying to re-enact the execution scene from a school play. Police, meanwhile, denied Shivam’s death was a mishap. “When we sent a team to the village to record their statement, his father said the boy had hanged himself because he was not allowed to go to his grandmother’s house,” Budaun SSP Sankalp Sharma said. “We did not find any proof of foul play, so no FIR was registered. We will send cops to the village again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/schoolboy-9-dies-while-enacting-hanging-scene-in-bhagat-singh-play/articleshow/84903861.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

There are 101 neo-natal intensive care units available and, in addition, the expert committee has proposed that additional 10 NICUs be commissioned on an urgent basis for the Goa Medical College and five for the North Goa district hospital. “There are also 36 paediatric ICUs (PICUs) available in Goa. The Expert Committee has recommended an increase in the PICU beds from 6 to 14 and also to set up a new 60-bedded PICU and two maternal and child health (MCH) wards of 30 beds each at the super specialty block (SSB),” Rane stated in a written reply in the legislative assembly. It has proposed that if there is a spike in cases and the need arises, the administration will be ready to convert 20% of the regular ICU beds into PICU beds. “It is also proposed that if there is a major increase in the number of Covid cases in the population under 18, then one hospital in each district should be designated as a dedicated paediatric Covid hospital and for that purpose the identification process be started right away,” Rane stated. The government has constituted a 15-member task force committee of 10 doctors with the chief minister as the chairman and head of the department, department of preventive and social medicine as member secretary for formulation and implementation of a strategy to tackle the third wave. This is in addition to a 14-member expert committee headed by the dean of the GMC, and other doctors to advise the task force and the government and give its recommendation on the steps to be taken to deal with the anticipated third wave. The directorate of health services has employed 567 doctors, nurses, technical staff and multi-tasking staff on contract basis for Covid management. “Apart from these doctors and interns from the GMC and the Goa Dental College have been deployed for Covid duties,” Rane stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-prepared-for-possible-third-wave-health-minister-tells-house/articleshow/84908522.cms||---

Set up less than a year ago (August 14), the centre has fitted artificial limbs for 40 people so far, 10 of them from the differently-abled department’s waiting list. District collector G S Sameeran had recently tweeted his praise and gratitude to the centre for fitting artificial limb to 40 people from poor backgrounds, who lost either one or both their limbs either due to amputation, without delay. Of the 40 people—two of them were fitted with double limbs and the remaining 38 beneficiaries got a single limb fitted. “We fit patients with the latest light weight prosthetic technology. The prosthetics are designed as per a patient’s requirement and measurements by four prosthetic craftsmen posted in the hospital,” the director of institute of orthopedics Dr Vetrivelchezhian said. Besides referring patients to CMCH for setting up of artificial limbs, the differently-abled welfare department has also begun helping children born with club foot to get braces and appropriate shoes. On Friday, collector G S Sameeran, himself fitted a three-year-old boy, Alagu Mani, who was born with club foot, with his new made to order braces. He also helped the boy walk a few steps with his new brace. The boy’s parents, including his father, Vel Murugan, who is also differently-abled with club foot, were moved to tears seeing their son walk more steadily. Vel Murugan runs a petty shop, which ran into losses due to the Covid-induced lockdown. He had appealed on July 5 to the differently-abled department for a new brace for himself and his son. Vel Murugan also received a set of braces on Friday. “The boy’s school going sister was also given a cycle. The family has now requested for a house,” a district administration official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cmchs-artificial-limb-centre-lends-a-helping-hand-to-40/articleshow/84908509.cms||---

The reserve was not on the elite list, announced by the Union environment ministry on the International Tiger Day, as state officials failed to give information to the Global Tiger Forum and WWF India, agencies that are responsible for giving CATS assessment for the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). ‘Selected reserves can receive better funding’Rajesh Gopal, secretary-general, Global Tiger Forum, said, “The National Committee of Conservation Assured Tiger Standards (CATS) recommends proposals for tiger reserve accreditation. The required data was not provided by Ranthambore, despite many reminders.” “The independent team of experts examines various parameters after a survey to find out if the reserve qualifies for accreditation. If the data is not provided, the process cannot be initiated,” he said. The CATS certification is a new conservation tool endorsed by the Global Tiger Forum (GTF) to set minimum standards for effective management of target species for conservation both outside and inside protected areas. Experts believe the selected reserves can receive better funding and support from the Centre as well from players across the world. An NTCA officer said, “Though Ranthambore has earned distinction in tourism, these activities should not be ignored as it sets best practice and standards to manage tigers.” Chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Ranthambore, T C Verma said, “We have almost compiled all the data and are hoping to get the tag soon.” “It’s a rigorous exercise and the reserve was hit by a serious staff crunch during the Covid-19,” sources in the department said. The CATS assessment has been conducted by NTCA in 27 tiger reserves in the first phase. Another popular reserve in the state, the Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) where the country’s first tiger reintroduction programme was started, claimed that the data was provided to NTCA on time. But the reserve too failed to get the accreditation. “Scientific data was provided to NTCA on time,” said R N Meena, chief conservator of forest, STR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ranthambore-reserve-fails-to-provide-data-for-global-tag/articleshow/84908527.cms||---

Prithiviraj, son of a welder in Kurumbapalayam, was diagnosed with heart failure in March. PSG Hospitals, where he is admitted, has put him on the heart transplant waiting list. The surgery costs Rs 25 lakh. For the last one month, youngsters of Kurumbapalayam have been approaching every avenue they know to raise the money. “We first did a door-to-door collection through the entire village and began approaching neighbouring villages,” said Senthil Kumar, a resident and member of the fundraising team. “We then appealed to our friends on WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. We also contacted friends and relatives settled in other countries, the Tamil diaspora, Rotary clubs, Lions clubs and even submitted petitions to the Coimbatore collector, health minister and chief minister for help,” he told TOI. The group has so far managed to raise Rs 10 lakh. Prithiviraj is number six on the waiting list, but getting a heart is challenging because he needs one that is small and needs a young donor. “Since the boy’s health has deteriorated, he is in the ICU where it costs Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 a day, which is being paid from the Rs 10 lakh collected,” said Senthil. The family was also told that the surgery will not get covered fully by the Tamil Nadu comprehensive health insurance scheme. “We are now creating Facebook videos, including one presented by actor Harish Uthaman. Team members who work for large corporates are trying to get their CSR fund, and are seeking help of NGOs,” Senthil added. Prithiviraj was diagnosed with the heart ailment after he vomited while descending Palani Temple hill in March. His father has already spent Rs 7 -8 lakh on his treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/villagers-come-together-to-raise-fund-for-boy-awaiting-heart-transplant/articleshow/84908488.cms||---

Thalapathy Murugesan, a DMK functionary, said they were shocked to see the video of AIADMK MLAs intimidating the collector, who is the first citizen of a district. “If this is the attitude of AIADMK men when not in power, imagine the plight of the officials when they were in power.” In the complaint, he said AIADMK MLAs, including S P Velumani, Pollachi Jayaraman and A K Selvaraj, had met the collector on Thursday, when they used disrespectful and intimidating words. “They had threatened him as well,” he said. Thalapathy Murugesan, who petitioned both the Sulur police and the city police commissioner, said the collector had been working hard ever since he took charge and had won the hearts of the people. “He has been taking efforts to set right the faulty moves taken in the past 10 years. Hence, AIADMK men had a grudge against him.” He has sent the petition to chief minister M K Stalin too. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Revenue Officers Association condemned the AIADMK MLAs for the ‘rude gestures’ and ‘harsh language’ they used in front of the collector in his chamber. “They besieged him and used an intimidating language, hurting the dignity of the collector.” The association has appealed the chief minister to ensure that such incidents were not repeated and safeguard government officials to function independently without being subjected to any threats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/plaint-against-aiadmk-mlas-for-intimidating-collector/articleshow/84908515.cms||---

She alleged that he would thrash the two of them when angry and would not even provide grains so that she could cook a meal for the child. Filing a complaint with Women’s Police (West), she said that her husband hit their daughter on the forehead with his cellphone, prompting her to leave the house.

She said that she gave birth to a daughter in 2013. However, her in-laws began harassing her more and more, picking up fights over petty issues. “My in-laws would not allow my daughter to sit or sleep on the sofa and the bed. They would always force her to sit and sleep on the floor. They did not even provide rice and pulses so that I could cook khichdi for my daughter. I had to bring these from my parents’ place,” she said in the FIR. She alleged that whenever her husband got angry, he would thrash her and their daughter. She also claimed that her in-laws had taken Rs 67 lakh from her parents to buy land in her name, but they embezzled the money.

---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Now, CPI warms up to Ramayana||KOZHIKODE: CPI has become the latest outfit to warm up to Ramayana with its Malappuram district committee holding a series of online discourses on Ramayana to combat what it sees as appropriation of the epic by Sangh Parivar and right-wing forces. The seven-day online talks on Ramayana is being carried out on the Facebook page of the party district committee and has state-level CPI leaders as speakers. The series titled ‘Ramayana and Indian Heritage’ that started on July 25 will conclude on Saturday, The talks are available live on Facebook page of the party’s district unit. “Currently, communal and fascist forces are claiming exclusive rights over everything related to Hinduism, especially with the society at large and other political parties ceding ground and moving away. Epics like Ramayana are part of the shared tradition and culture of the country,” said PK Krishnadas, Malappuram district secretary of CPI. He added that holding a talk series on Ramayana was an attempt by the party to see how the epic should be read and understood in the progressive times. The posters of the talk series have portraits of Lord Ram and Sita. The topics dealt with are diverse like ‘People during the era of Ramayana and political links with other countries’ by CPI leader Mullakkara Ratnakaran, ‘Contemporary Politics in Ramayana’ by CPI fellow traveller M Keshavan Nair, ‘The Many Ramayanas’ by poet Alankode Leelakrishnan, ‘The constant novelty of Ramayana’ by AP Ahmed, ‘Ezhuthachan’s Ramayana’ by writer KP Ramanunni and ‘Some thoughts on Ramayana’ by CPI leader Ajith Koladi. In his talk on Contemporary Politics in Ramayana Nair said that politics ingrained in Ramayana was far different than the one practiced by Sangh Parivar. “Lord Ram is shown as a confluence of contradictory forces and for communists the first thing that come to mind, while taking a close look at the epic, is the principle of dialectical materialism espoused by Karl Marx,” he said. Poet Leelakrishnan said that communists in the country have the responsibility to ensure that Ramayana does not become a tool in the hand of communal forces and they should strive to continue the alternate readings of Ramayana. “We can resist fascist interpretations of Ramayana by highlighting the diverse versions of the epic,” he said. Samskritha Sangham– a pro-Left cultural outfit–had lined up several events during Karkkadakam month which is observed as Ramayana month with seminars and discussions based on various versions of the Ramayana held during the month in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/now-cpi-warms-up-to-ramayana/articleshow/84906362.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Those reversing Devasthanam Board & land laws need to explain its faults, says Trivendra||Dehradun: Since March 10, a number of major decisions taken by former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat have either been reversed or are being reviewed by his successors. “There is always a possibility of a positive change, but at the same time people either reversing or putting key development issues on the backburner need to highlight the fault in these decisions," the ex-CM told TOI. Char Dham Devasthanam Board Management Act, changes in Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, development of Gairsain as Commissionerate, removal of 100 party members from minister level ranks, changes in Kumbh and establishing development authorities in the hills are some of the key issues which have hit roadblocks in the last few months. "Party members had supported these decisions. We have not infringed upon the rights of priests and things are working smoothly. Only after an elaborate study of prominent temples of the country, a board was constituted for Char Dham,” Rawat explained. Interestingly, while the Bill was tabled in the Assembly by tourism minister Satpal Maharaj in December 2019, the current CM Pushkar Singh Dhami, too, was a part of the House. The Bill was strongly supported by the BJP lawmakers then and in June 2020 it became an Act after official notification. Trivendra pointed out that a large-scale development work at the Char Dham has been completed and is also under construction. “If we come up with a strong and systematic way of improving the infrastructure, then what is wrong in it,” Rawat said, adding that barring some politically motivated persons, no one else was opposing the Board. On the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, Trivendra said, “ND Tiwari, in his tenure, placed a ceiling that allowed a person from another state to buy a maximum of 500 sqm land. BC Khanduri reduced the upper limit to 250 sqm. We are talking about economic growth of the hills, but no concrete steps were being taken in this regard. With no new ventures, how can we expect employment and development.” Trivendra claimed that he allowed a minor amendment to allow people from other states to buy desired land in the hills, but with a rider that it could only be purchased for opening schools, tourism activity, health services and industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/those-reversing-devasthanam-board-land-laws-need-to-explain-its-faults-says-trivendra/articleshow/84900896.cms||Kautilya Singh

Police refused to initiate action against the mill owners even after Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) cadres alerted them, CITU district president C Padmanaban said. “After receiving information about seven women aged between 18 and 25 locked up in Kumaran spinning mill, we tried to contact senior police officers, but received no response. We were planning to conduct a protest in front of the mill when the mill management sent the women out. We rescued them and brought them to the CITU office at Kattoor,” he said. The women hail from a tribal community, Padmanaban said. “Touts from Jharkhand had sent 18 women to the mill in April. The touts had promised Rs 13,000 per month. But the women were given Rs 220 a day, from which Rs 35 was deducted for food. They were forced to work for 12 hours. They were staying in the workers quarters and the mill management had restricted them from stepping out. So, seven of them informed their parents and activists in Jharkhand, who contacted us,” he said. Most of the private mills here treat guest workers as bonded labourers, said CITU member V Sathishkumar. “Eleven women from Jharkhand are still working at the mill. They refused to come out after threatened by touts. We are ready to rescue them if they approach us,” he said. The rescued guest workers boarded Dhanbad Express from Coimbatore Railway Junction on Friday afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/seven-jharkhand-women-rescued-from-spinning-mill/articleshow/84908534.cms||---

Every day, Tumda leaves his house in Khatamba village in Vansda taluka of Navsari district early in the morning to take guard at the kadia naka, the gathering point to find casual labour. His struggles are being played out at a time when the nation is celebrating India’s sportspersons at the Tokyo Olympics. Tumda had in August last year started selling vegetables in the Jamalpur area of Ahmedabad. But the curfews and the curbs imposed by the government to control Covid forced him to exit that business. Tumda had no money to start another business, so lining up for daily wage was his only option. He is the sole earning member of his family. His father had to stop working after undergoing a cancer surgery. “I was in the playing 11 of India’s cricket team that lifted the Blind World Cup on March 20, 2018, after chasing the challenging target of 308 set by Pakistan in Sharjah,” Tumda said. “Now, I have to lift bricks and sand to run my house.” He said that after India’s blind cricket team won the World Cup, several ministers and politicians from New Delhi and Gandhinagar had promised him a job. It appears that they have turned a blind eye to him. “Earlier, my father used to work as a casual labourer so I did not have to think much about family income,” Tumda said. “But two years ago, he underwent a surgery for oral cancer. Skin from his hand was grafted on to his mouth. He was told not to do strenuous tasks.” Tumda said he can no longer invest in perishable commodities such as vegetables. “But even as a casual labourer, I face uncertainty,” he said. “I wish government authorities consider my plight and give me a job or financial aid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-world-cup-lifting-sand/articleshow/84906415.cms||Ashish Chauhan

But from now, it will also be a special date for the Ludhiana family who had been struggling hard to earn a living. After the TOI highlighted the plight of nine-year-old Ranjot Singh Jodha, who sells bhelpuri to feed his family a two-square meal after the death of his father, Sonu arranged for the education of the boy and his two sisters and a job for his mother. On Thursday, sharing the TOI’s news report, Sonu posted on his official Twitter handle, “Tell Ranjot and his sisters that they don’t need to sell bhelpuri anymore. I have got their admission done in a school and job for their mother. They will have a new life starting tomorrow.” Sonu’s friend Anirudh Gupta, CEO of the DCM Group of Schools, has adopted Ranjot and his sisters for their education and also given a job to their mother in the institute. On July 26, the TOI had reported about Ranjot, whose father had died about five months ago due to a cardiac arrest. He and his two sisters, aged 11 and six, had to quit studies as they could not afford a smartphone. To help his family, Ranjot started selling bhelpuri outside a liquor vend near Jalandhar Bypass. Following the TOI news report, Chandigarh-based philanthropist and founder of Plaksha University, Karan Gilhotra, who is also a friend of Sonu, contacted the TOI to help Ranjot and his family. After discussion with Sonu and Anirudh, they offered to provide education to the children and a job to their mother Komal. On Friday, Ranjot and Komal visited DCM Presidency School and met Anirudh. Sonu and Karan also joined them through a video call. Anirudh said, “Our school is adopting Ranjot and his sisters for their education and we have given them smartphones along with some books and stationery. We will first give their mother training and then she can join here. We want to groom them a little bit before admitting them. However, if somehow they do not feel comfortable here, we will bear the expenses of their education, books and uniform wherever they wish to study.” NEW BEGINNING: Actor and philanthropist Sonu Sood and his friend Karan Gilhotra virtually interact with Ranjot and his mother at a school on FridayIn the video call, Sonu thanked Anirudh for offering help and while interacting with Ranjot he said, “You don’t have to sell bhelpuri now. Study hard, Ranjot, and fulfil dreams of your parents.” In reply Ranjot thanked Sonu and also wished him a happy birthday. A visibly happy Ranjot said, “I will study now and become a police officer.” Ranjot’s teary-eyed mother said, “I cannot thank Sonu Sood and Anirudh Gupta enough. They are angels sent by Waheguru for us. Sonu ji's birthday is more special to me now.” Anirudh said, “We are celebrating the 75th anniversary of DCM Group of Schools this year. I was glad when Sonu and Karan approached me for this cause. Our organization has already been into community outreach programmes like adopting green belts, teaching slum children and providing vocational training to girls.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/sonu-sood-comes-to-aid-of-9-yr-old-boy-selling-bhelpuri/articleshow/84903858.cms||Payal Dhawan

Alleging that they also suffered despite not being hit by bullets, the fishermen pleaded the court that they should also be compensated like two of their colleagues who died and the boat owner who were granted Rs 10 crore compensation. On June 15, the Supreme Court had accepted the compensation of Rs 10 crores deposited by the Italian government. Out of that amount, Rs 4 crore was to be paid to the family members of each deceased person and the rest to the boat owner. The apex court thereafter closed all the proceedings in India against the two Italian Marines — Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone — accused of killing two Kerala fishermen in 2012. “After the shooting incident, the applicants are afraid to venture into the sea. On account of the same, the applicants have lost their means of livelihood and their moral right to feed their family members. The applicants and their families have been struggling even for basic sustenance. They have also undergone immense mental trauma and suffering,” the petition said, seeking the court’s intervention to grant them compensation. The Permanent Court of Arbitration had in July last year given its decision saying that the two Italian marines will not be tried in India and in its judgment had ruled that India is entitled to claim compensation from Italy. It had also observed that the marines had violated international law and, as a result, Italy breached India’s freedom of navigation, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/enrica-lexie-case-10-fishermen-move-sc-seeking-compensation/articleshow/84906451.cms||---

The report submitted by superintending archaeologist said the exposed structure covered an area of about 15x15 feet and appears to be part of a residential complex constructed by lakhauri bricks laid in lime mortar. “On the basis of architectural style and construction material used, these can be dated to late medieval period,” read the report. ASI also maintained that the area around Golden Temple is culturally rich and there is the possibility of buried heritage structures in the surrounding areas. On July 15, an old structure was found while digging for jora ghar near Sarai Akal Takht Sahib under Galliara project. A few Sikh bodies blamed SGPC for allegedly destroying the Sikh heritage, following which it was decided to get the site inspected by ASI. Deputy superintending archaeologist Anil Kumar Tiwari constituted a team, which inspected the site on July 20 and submitted a detailed and illustrated report of the matter. “Since a limited area has been exposed, and only a part of structures is visible hence in this circumstances it is not possible to ascertain exact nature, use, an association of these structures with other existing structures of the surrounding area” said the report. The ASI has recommended to the district administration to initiate steps for the preservation of the exposed structure: “Since exposed structures are heritage remains and cannot, therefore, be allowed to be destroyed, district administration should initiate necessary steps for their preservation under the Punjab Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1964 or under the relevant provisions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/asr-administration-should-preserve-old-structure-near-golden-temple-asi/articleshow/84908570.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: With no demand for jabs, private hospitals stop buying more vaccines||HYDERABAD: With very few people turning up at private hospitals for Covid-19 doses, majority of hospitals have stopped procuring fresh vials. Surprisingly, the government immunisation centres continue to witness long queues of people to get the jabs.  The government health centres are also facing a shortage of vaccine. Telangana received 1.59 crore doses (till July 21) as per figures from the Centre, while the state government purchased 9.25 lakh doses with its own funds. Private hospitals purchased 43.5 lakh doses and the rest are free provided by the Union government. As per the new guidelines, the state government will continue to get free vaccines, while the private hospitals will have to purchase it. With some big hospitals having an unused stock of 2 to 3 lakh doses, and with no rush at their vaccination centres, sources said the need to buy fresh vials may not arise soon. Telangana Super Speciality Hospitals Association president Dr B Bhaskar Rao said that during the peak of the second wave, private hospitals had faced instances of patients attempting to influence managements to obtain a dose. “That desperation has reversed now in private hospitals. We have to finish the available vaccine stocks first,” he said. Experts said another reason for people avoiding private hospitals is the high pricing of the doses. “It is understandable if the vaccine rate is not affordable to a few. But those who can afford should not neglect, and get themselves inoculated,” a senior manager of a private hospital said. Meanwhile, experts said many people still have a wrong notion that they should take the vaccine dose only when the number of Covid-19 cases is high. “It is better to take the dose when the cases are stable. The doses will not give immediate immunity and take at least one month to provide total protection,” said Dr Subodh Kandamuthan, director and professor of Centre for Health Care Management, ASCI, Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-no-demand-for-jabs-pvt-hosps-stop-buying-more-vax/articleshow/84906392.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

A part of road plaster on the Thane-bound lane of the arterial bypass caved in on Thursday, exposing the reinforcements on the flyover stretch towards the Kharegaon landing. The public works department has taken up a temporary repair block. As a result, heavy vehicles are being diverted from Shilphata to Thane via Mahape, Airoli and Kalyan Durgadi, adding to the strain on these already congested roads. “There was an increase in traffic on the Eastern Express highway from the Anand Nagar point. Congestion is likely to remain till the repairs are done,” informed Balasaheb Patil, deputy police commissioner, Thane traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-traffic-snarls-on-eeh-as-mumbra-bypass-shut/articleshow/84910185.cms||---

---||Delhi||Gangster Kala Jathedi, who fled custody last year, arrested||NEW DELHI: Fugitive gangster Sandeep alias Kala Jathedi, who was on the most wanted list of several states, including Delhi, Haryana and Punjab, has been arrested from Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur by Delhi Police. Jathedi, who had escaped from police custody in Faridabad in February 2020, carried a reward of Rs 7 lakh on him. He had orchestrated a daring shootout at GTB Hospital in March this year to free his henchman Kuldeep Fajja who was later caught and killed in an encounter with Special Cell of Delhi Police. TOI was the first to report about Jathedi’s role in the shootout and about his immediate plan to shift base to north India as he had been working to rule the underworld in Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, and parts of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. He had been found using international numbers to communicate with his associates, leading the cops to believe he might be based in Dubai. To expand his syndicate’s hold in Delhi, he had joined hands with jailed gangsters like Lawrence Bishnoi and Jitender Gogi, besides Kala Rana who is apparently based in Bangkok. The plan was to exploit the vacuum created in the crime world with the arrest or encounter of gangsters like Neeraj Bawania and Anand Pal Singh. Jathedi, who was learnt to be shuttling between Dubai and Bangkok, proposed a larger syndicate of all gangs. Recently, Jathedi shot to limelight following his rivalry with wrestler Sushil Kumar who had assaulted Jathedi’s nephew and killed his friend, Sagar Dhankhad, at Chhatrasal Stadium. Jathedi, who is in his mid-30s, quit studies after Class XII and has been a familiar name for Haryana Police for over a decade. He had committed his first murder in 2009 during a robbery in Rohtak. In 2016, a Sonipat court handed him life imprisonment in a 2010 murder case. Jathedi became powerful after being introduced to gangster Lawrence Bishnoi by a criminal from Najafgarh, Kapil Sangwan. He became instrumental in eliminating several rivals of Bishnoi, who helped him flee from police custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gangster-jathedi-who-fled-custody-last-year-arrested/articleshow/84908612.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Mumbai||Shilpa Shetty Kundra’s suit: Bombay HC says must balance press freedom with right to privacy||MUMBAI: In some relief to Shilpa Shetty Kundra, the Bombay high court on Friday asked a TV channel based in Uttar Pradesh to take down a video content which, it observed, “clearly portrays her as duplicitous at a personal level” and noted that two others—an “online journalist” and a host of an online entertainment channel— have themselves removed their content after the actor filed a defamation suit on Thursday. The two undertook not to upload the content back. Justice Gautam Patel, who passed the order, clarified that “no part of this order is to be construed as a gag on media except for the two-three instances mentioned”. “Consideration in defamation and wide protection recognized under freedom of press will have to be balanced against right of privacy. It is possible that exception to free speech will have to be exceedingly narrowly tailored, but it is not possible to fail to recognise right to privacy nor to say that because a person is a public figure of some sort that such figure has forfeited her right to privacy,” Justice Patel said. After hearing Shetty’s counsel Saraf and Abhinav Chandrachud, the HC said the TV channel’s portrayal of her in a July 26 video “is transgressing some limits…and will need to be taken down”. “I believe some of the issues this suit raise will require closer scrutiny because it is not possible to say at this stage that all statements are of the same defamatory character,” said Justice Patel, while dictating his order. Saraf, he noted, restricted his urgent pleas to a few from the 20-odd cited. Justice Patel said, “This is not to mean I have rejected his plea with regard to others nor is it to mean that he has conceded his case with regard to others…” Shetty’s Rs 25-crore defamation suit is against 29 parties across online print, electronic and social media—the 29th being a John Doe (unknown person)—to restrain them from posting, reposting, circulating any derogatory and false content in print or audio visual formats and to prevent any further invasion of her privacy. Her application for interim relief alleged it was to increase their viewership and prejudice in people’s minds against her and her husband during the pendency of an investigation into the pornographic racket. Shetty’s counsel Birendra Saraf said one of the parties who have now taken down the content had questioned the quality of her parenting in regard to her children. It was “malicious and defamatory” and a reckless disregard to her fundamental rights as “involving her personal life and that of her children was a clear intrusion in her privacy,” he added. The HC said, “Now, whether this is malicious with reckless disregard for the truth or made knowing to be false are matters that will have to be considered on another day.” “None of this involves or should be allowed to involve Shetty as parent. That aspect of her life is protected by right to privacy,” it said, adding: “He has taken down the video...is not to be uploaded again.” The HC said the TV channel and the online entertainment channel “seem to me to be even at this ad-interim stage malicious…certainly Shetty has not been contacted for her comments”. Justice Patel, however, passed no observations or orders over another alleged defamatory content on an online portal saying it “directly relates to the investigation” in the case. The HC called for replies from all the defendants by August 18 and a single comprehensive rejoinder from Shetty by August 26. It will hear the matter again on September 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/shilpas-suit-hc-says-must-balance-press-freedom-with-right-to-privacy/articleshow/84910198.cms||Swati Deshpande

The Karamadai police said the incident occurred when M Anand, a resident of Seeliyur village in their jurisdiction, was heading to a grocery shop from his house on a motorcycle. “When he reached Seeliyur bus stop on Karamadai-Tholampalayam road, a truck laden with coconuts hit the motorcycle. Anand fell on the road and was crushed under the wheels of the truck. When the truck driver tried to apply brakes, the vehicle overturned, scattering the coconuts on the road,” a police officer said. The villagers rushed Anand to the government hospital at Mettupalayam, where doctors declared him brought dead. Following this, his family members and relatives staged a road roko on Tholampalayam Road. Karamadai police inspector Kumar and team, however, managed to pacify them. “We have picked up the truck driver for inquiry and taken the truck to police station,” the officer said. The Karamadai police have registered a case against the truck driver and further investigation is on. Anand’s body was, meanwhile, handed over to his family members after postmortem on Friday. He is survived by wife Rubina, 10-year-old daughter Nithika Sree and four-year-old son Nishvanth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-killed-as-truck-runs-over-him-near-karamadai/articleshow/84908548.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Rajkot widow’s belated claim: Insurance payout ordered||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission has ordered an insurance company to pay insurance amount of Rs 1 lakh to a widow, who failed to claim the amount within stipulated time period. It said that in the male-dominated society, it is normal that a woman may not be knowing about her husband’s financial transactions. Rajkot-resident Hetal Mehta had a case that she came to know it very late that her husband Manish Mehta was a shareholder of Nagrik Sahakari Bank Ltd and was covered with life insurance policy from The New India Assurance Co Ltd. Mehta died in 2014 and his widow claimed the insurance after 18 months. The insurer rejected her claim saying that she should have intimated her husband’s death within 30 days. The widow’s complaint before Rajkot’s consumer court was rejected merely on the ground of delay. When she approached the state commission, judicial member M J Mehta said that the insurance company should have taken humanitarian view because women are not given enough importance in the patriarchal society and they remain ignorant about financial transactions by family members. The social condition is such that women are not informed about financial matters. The commission also observed that it was natural that Mehta might not have informed his wife about his shareholding in the bank and about his insurance cover. She claimed insurance when she came to know about it and the 18-month delay could have been pardoned. The commission ordered the company to pay Rs 1 lakh insurance amount to her and Rs 5,000 extra for legal expenditure that she had to incur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/widows-belated-claim-insurance-payout-ordered/articleshow/84906446.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||PIL seeking Ellenabad bypoll filed in HC||Chandigarh: Aggrieved by the delay in holding of byelection in the Ellenabad state assembly seat in Sirsa, a petition has been filed before the Punjab and Haryana high court. Ellenabad seat is lying vacant for the past around six months because of the resignation by Abhay Singh Chautala who was elected from Ellenabad on Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) ticket in 2019 assembly polls. The matter has reached before the HC in the wake of a petition filed in public interest by Vinod Kumar and other residents of Ellenabad assembly in Sirsa district of Haryana. The petitioners have sought directions for declaration of the election schedule of the byelection so that there could be a representation of people from this constituency in the Haryana legislative assembly. The assembly seat has been lying vacant since January 27, which is more than six months. Further directions have also been sought to initiate necessary steps adopting the Covid-19 precautions, safety arrangements towards the conduct of peaceful and fair elections for byelection of Ellenabad assembly constituency in the interest of the general public. The petitioners have impleaded the chief secretary of Haryana, Election Commission of India (ECI) and the chief electoral officer Haryana as respondent parties. The petition is expected to come up for hearing next week. The petition filed through advocate Sandeep Goyat has submitted that more than six months’ time has passed and there is no representation in the Haryana legislative assembly from Ellenabad constituency and the people of the constituency are facing a lot of difficulties due to non-representation from their constituency. It has also been stated that according to Section 151-A of the Representation of Peoples Act 1951, a byelection for filling any vacancy shall be held within a period of six months from the date of occurrence of the vacancy but in the present case the statutory period has already elapsed. It has also been stated that on May 5, the ECI had announced to defer byelection of three notified vacancies in parliament constituencies and eight vacancies in assembly constituencies including Ellenabad in Haryana. It was decided by the ECI that due to the outbreak of the second wave of Covid-19 in the country, it would not be appropriate to hold bye-elections till the pandemic situation significantly improves and conditions become conducive to hold these byelections. According to the petitioner, when the ECI announced to defer the elections, the Covid-19 was at its peak but even at that time, general elections were held in some states of the country and Panchayat elections were held in Uttar Pradesh as well. “In Ellenabad, it has come to the knowledge of the petitioners that no active cases are left and currently it is the most suitable time to hold the elections. There are hardly any cases in the Ellenabad assembly area as well as in the entire Sirsa district,” the PIL said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pil-seeking-ellenabad-bypoll-filed-in-hc/articleshow/84908615.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Covid effect: Insurers float health plans covering consumables||HYDERABAD: With consumables like PPE kits, gloves, masks, face shields and sanitisers jacking up medical bills in Covid-19 times, some health insurance players have now started floating health insurance plans that cover these hitherto uncovered items. According to Amit Chhabra, head, health insurance, Policybazaar.com, data by Policybazaar.com suggests that if a consumer has a policy that covers consumables, the claims payout ratio is 11% higher as compared to the ones who do not have it. Bhabatosh Mishra, director underwriting, products & claims at Max Bupa Health Insurance explained that the regulator has a standard prescribed non-payable items list. This contains items like consumable gloves, nebulization kits and oxygen masks, which are not payable. “Since the pandemic, the burden of these non-payable items in the form of out-of-pocket expenses went up substantially. Deductions in claims is one big factor for customer dissatisfaction. Thus, we addressed this issue under our flagship product ReAssure…For a nominal premium it safeguards claims by paying for the non-payable items, as defined by the regulator,” he said. He added that after receiving a positive response for the feature, the insurer has now extended this rider with its existing products as well giving customers the option of adding this feature to their plans. Chhabra added that during pre-Covid times, these consumables used to constitute around 2-3% of the total medical bills but now this has gone anywhere upto 15-18%. “The claim payout percentages have got reduced for insurance companies due to this and till last year there were no plans where consumables were covered in insurance products but in the last one year, there have been a couple of products where consumables items also are getting covered,” he added. An industry expert pointed out that more insurers are expected to follow suit in the coming days and even in the post-Covid world, this trend is expected to continue. Even Animesh Das, head (product strategy), Acko Insurance, pointed out that his company will be launching their health insurance products for individuals in the coming days that will cover consumables too. He said its group policies already covered this feature but before Covid-19 struck, very few people used to opt for it. However, now a higher number of people have started using the feature in the last one year, he added. Das said on average, customers pay 10-12% of their premium to get consumables covered in group policies and it varies based on the sum insured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-effect-insurers-float-health-plans-covering-consumables/articleshow/84906424.cms||Swati Rathor
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Inquiry commission rejects Param Bir Singh’s plea against probe||MUMBAI: A commission of inquiry headed by Justice K U Chandiwal on Friday rejected an application filed by former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh objecting to its maintainability and purpose on grounds that the inquiry entrusted to it is already within the Bombay High Court’s purview. Significantly, dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze told the commission that he does not subscribe to the submissions made by his former boss. Former home minister Anil Deshmukh and three other policemen, Sanjeev Palande, Sanjay Patil and Raju Bhujbal, too took a contrary view in their replies. The state government had set up a one-man commission headed by Justice Chandiwal to probe into the charges made by Parambir Singh against Deshmukh. Singh’s lawyer Sanjay Jain submitted that the scope of the inquiry was to find out if any offence is disclosed by the contents in his March 20 letter to the chief minister. On the high court’s directions, CBI had conducted a preliminary probe and registered a criminal case against Deshmukh, and hence the commission serves no purpose, he argued. Justice Chandiwal in his order said, “No astrologer is required to verify a dividing line between the object under the commission of inquiry act and investigation under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code for penal consequences. The commission has a basic purpose to assist the state government to determine further course of action in such matter of public importance...” Justice Chandiwal observed that when the high court was informed that the state had set up a committee, it disposed of a PIL while the Supreme Court at no stage has recorded that the appointment of an independent commission is a futile exercise. “The parameters for the investigation by the CBI and rules for inquiry before the commission are quite distinct. They do not seem to overlap or encroach upon anybody’s jurisdiction. Ongoing inquiry or FIR should not be an impediment to the committee,” he said. The committee is only a fact-finding committee and is not expected to adjudicate upon rights of the parties. “It cannot be subscribed that by virtue of FIR, the scope of the present commission has been judicially adjudicated upon and nothing survives to be inquired into,” Justice Chandiwal said. “The appointment of commission cannot be branded to be for a collateral purpose and the very purpose of the commission has not at all been judicially adjudicated by order of April 5, 2021, they…do not overlap anybody’s jurisdiction. The prayer for discontinuation of the commission is rejected,” he said in conclusion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-inquiry-commission-rejects-param-birs-plea-against-probe/articleshow/84908637.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

A corporator, an elected representative of a ward, is entitled to receive Rs 1.24 crore per annum as local area development fund, which she/he has to spend on civic amenities in her/his area. The fund is released in four instalments of Rs 31 lakh each. The first two instalments were released in March and April earlier this year. City Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia said the LMC House meeting on Sunday had approved the decision to release the third and fourth instalments in August so that the civic works initiated by the corporators in their respective wards could resume. The decision was taken after many corporators raised the issue that the funds released earlier had exhausted due to which several civic works in their areas have been stalled. Corporators use these funds for construction or maintenance of inner roads, tiling in lanes, cementing drains, pavement interlocking, maintenance of parks and repair of streetlights. This year, corporators have also been allowed to spend a part of the fund on Covid-19 prevention. Corporator of Ambedkarnagar ward, Rais Ahmed, said: “Our ward has three tubewells but all of them are lying defunct for six months. My first priority after receiving the corporator funds will be repairing those tubewells to ensure proper drinking facility in my ward.” Similarly, other corporators said they would use funds for the repair of roads in residential colonies that are in a bad shape and are hazardous for residents in the rainy season. In March, LMC had moved a proposal to slash the local area fund to Rs 50 lakh per annum, but it was dropped following stiff opposition by corporators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/corporators-funds-unlock-devpt-begins/articleshow/84908646.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Rs 1,300 crore Project Lion moots royal revamp for pride||AHMEDABAD: The Union ministry of environment and forest has given its preliminary approval for the Rs 1,300 crore Project Lion, which envisages measures such as increasing the prey base and strengthening of surveillance. The proposal has been sent to the Union cabinet for the final nod. The project will be implemented over a period of 10 years. Sources in the Union ministry of environment and forest said that the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) will be the implementing agency. Some Gujarat officers and lion experts from the state will be deputed to the NTCA for Project Lion. Sources said that under the project, the NTCA will develop areas for prey base and create a habitat suitable for lions in the coastal belts and other areas. The Gujarat forest department intends to set up satellite habitats for the lions. These spots include Umath Virdi in Bhavnagar, Gir, Girnar, Mitiyala, Jessore-Hipawadi, Babra Virdi, Hingolgadh, and the coastal belt from Rajula to Jafrabad and extending up to Mahuva. The officials said that these are areas suitable for creating satellite habitats and lions have been spotted here over the past couple of years. However, the big cats are yet to make these their permanent homes. Officials said that under Project Lion, even some areas within the Gir forest will undergo interventions, such as the planting of more fruit-bearing trees to attract ungulates like nilgai. This will ensure that the big cats are not forced to venture out of their territories in search of food. Sometimes hungry lions roaming far from their home ranges have killed livestock. The officials said that the 30,000 sq km area in Saurashtra where lions have been sighted frequently over the years will be a potential abode for them. As of now, about 14,000 sq km in that zone has been annexed permanently by the lions. The officials said that apart from boosting the prey base, Project Lion will cover wells and create an adequate number of artificial ponds to ensure drinking water for the lions. The NTCA has decided that the practice of undertaking two censuses for the herbivores will continue even after the implementation of Project Lion. The figures will be reported to the NTCA as a matter of routine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rs-1300cr-project-lion-moots-royal-revamp-for-pride/articleshow/84906525.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Sawant said the opposition could have discussed the bills in assembly, but instead chose to throw a book and cap at the speaker in protest. He also defended the curtailing of the monsoon session due to the ongoing pandemic. The chief minister said that the last day of the session was meant for discussing private member’s resolutions, while stating that opposition members should have offered solutions to the government bills which was introduced in assembly. Questioning the motive behind seeking postponement for passing of bills to the next assembly session, Sawant said, “I don’t know why they behaved liked this as though this is the last assembly session.

According to police, the two owners of the call centre, Lakhan Jagwani and Vijender Singh Rawat, who were also arrested, procured the details of the US residents using illegal techniques and extorted money from them in the name of saving them from legal action. Urvija Goel, deputy commissioner of police (West), said, “The magnitude of the total cheated amount is estimated to be in crores. They were cheating US citizens by impersonating themselves as government officials of US Customs and Border Protection Department, Drug Enforcement Agency, Sheriff, FBI and USA’s treasury office. They extorted money from overseas victims in the name of saving them from legal action and arrest. On Wednesday, a police team conducted a raid at the call centre in Hari Nagar where many people were engaged in making and receiving international calls.” This type of scam usually begins with a pre-recorded threatening robocall claiming to be from the legal department of the US and telling a foreigner that “your SSN will be suspended soon” and to save themselves from legal action, the person is persuaded to connect via pressing 1 on IVR. When the person presses 1 on IVR, the call gets connected to one of the telecallers sitting in a fake call centre. The telecallers impersonate themselves as US government officials and tell the innocent foreigners that a parcel containing drugs addressed in the name of the victim has been seized by the US Customs and Border Protection Department. To save themselves from ‘legal action’, victims are then told to immediately transfer their entire bank balance amount into e-gift cards. They are told that their money would be refunded later by the government. As the numbers used are spoofed VoIP numbers, the complainant can neither call back nor those numbers can be traced. “The alleged persons procured the details of the victims in the US using illegal techniques, VoIP calling and caller ID spoofing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fake-call-centre-busted-65-held-for-duping-us-citizens/articleshow/84908680.cms||---

Pointing out that the constantly mutating virus poses unforeseen challenges and there is no room for vaccine hesitancy, he said there is no other more powerful way to protect ourselves and people around us. He urged vaccine makers to step up vaccine supplies to ensure vaccines are administered to all eligible citizens, which the government intends to do by the end of 2021. Naidu, who was visiting the Genome Valley facility of Bharat Biotech on Friday, said that the intranasal vaccine being developed by the Hyderabad-based company could go a long way in tackling the issue of vaccine hesitancy as it was non-injectable and easy to administer. Lauding Hyderabad’s emergence as a global vaccines and bulk drugs hub, he said this was a key reason why one of the recently sanctioned Central Drug Laboratories had been located here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/need-to-focus-on-covid-vax-for-kids-vp/articleshow/84906503.cms||---

As per the powers conferred upon him to take decisions in the interest of public safety or convenience, commissioner of police Deepak Pandey has issued ‘No helmet no petrol’ order on July 29. The decision of ‘‘No helmet no petrol’ has been taken on the recommendation of ACP (Traffic). The ‘No helmet no petrol’ rule will be followed by all the petrol pump owners in the jurisdiction of the city police commissionerate. However, in exceptional cases, if petrol is given to a biker who is not wearing a helmet, the petrol pump owner has to fill a certain form provided by the city police and send it to the city traffic branch unit as well as the office of the Deputy Regional Transport Order on a daily basis. The concerned traffic police would then take up an enquiry on why the biker was not wearing helmet. If it is found that the biker was not wearing helmet for no special reason, police would send a proposal of suspending his/her driving license to the RTO. To ensure that there is no law and order issue at petrol pumps owing to altercation between motorists and petrol pump operators, the police will provide strict bandobast for two weeks initially and decide on retaining or removing the security according to the situation. CP Deepak Pandey said the decision was a necessary as a large number of motorists die in road accidents . He said that from 2017 to June 2021, 825 people have lost their lives in 782 fatal accidents. Of the 825 deceased people, 467 were bikers and 394 of these deceased bikers were not wearing helmets at the time of accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-helmet-no-petrol-in-nashik-from-aug-15-cp/articleshow/84901028.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Hyderabad||Many lose marks as ‘reference year’ rule comes into play||HYDERABAD: Class toppers were at the receiving end this year as the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) asked schools to consider the performance of students in one of the last three academic years as a reference year while allotting marks. As a result, schools could award marks in a range (above 90% - 95.5%) only to a few students, while many deserving candidates felt undone. Principals of city schools said they had to revise marks of students two to three times before the board accepted final results. “We had 42 students who were getting above 95%. We had to bring their marks down, as only 27 students had got above 95% in 2018, which was our reference year,” said Latha Shankar, principal, P Obul Reddy Public School. She said it was toppers and academically-weak students who were at a loss this year. “Likewise, we had to put about 10 students in the 40-50 range even though three or four students could have gone to a higher range,” she said. “If not for the pandemic, some of our students would have secured one or two per cent higher marks. It is unfair for a few students, but many also benefited as they were awarded more marks. Overall, we are happy with the result,” said Narsimha Reddy, principal, The Hyderabad Public School, Ramanthapur. D Usha Reddy, principal and CEO, Meridian School for Boys and Girls, said it was disheartening to note that students who performed extremely well in the current year had to have their marks pruned. “Marks of deserving six to seven students had to be reduced.” Gautham Singh, a student of Obul Reddy, who secured 99.96 percentile in JEE Mains, said: “Definitely, I would have got more marks if exams were conducted. But I don’t want to appear for exams at a later stage as these marks will not be considered for IIT counselling or I might lose out on getting a seat in a foreign university.” Gautham’s school had to reduce his computer marks by five to bring his percentage down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/many-lose-marks-as-reference-year-rule-comes-into-play/articleshow/84906513.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Goa Police detained the protesters and took them to the Dona Paula police outpost. Congress functionaries were released later in the evening. The party said that Sawant had shocked the nation and shamed Goa by making irresponsible statements and putting the onus on the teen survivors and their parents. State Congress president Girish Chodankar described Sawant’s statements as sick and insensitive. “This statement is nothing but the sick mind of Dr Sawant and is reflection of the anti-women mentality of the RSS,” said Chodankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-workers-detained-after-protest-outside-sawants-house/articleshow/84908702.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Benaulim gangrape remarks taken out of context: Goa CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Under fire for his remarks on the recent gangrape of two minor girls at Benaulim beach, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday said his statements had been taken out of context even as he maintained that the safety of children, especially minors, has to be a shared responsibility. Sawant drew sharp criticism on social media platforms and demands for an apology soared after he told the state assembly on Wednesday that teens, particularly minors, should not be “spending the nights on beaches”. He had also said, “When 14-year-olds stay on the beach the whole night, the parents need to introspect. Just because children don’t listen, we cannot put the responsibility on the government and police.” “My statement about the unfortunate incident was taken out of context. Both as head of a responsible government and as a father of a 14-year-old daughter, I was deeply pained and disturbed. The pain of this incident is inexplicable,” Sawant said on Friday. “I reiterate that in matters that concern the safety and security of our children, there will be no compromise. Let there be no place for misunderstanding. Let us trust each other. Let us stand united as one Goa so that all such evils can be defeated with all our might.” The chief minister went on to say, “At no point have I tried to deny the right to security provided by our law. Goa Police has been a truly professional force especially when it comes to security of women and children. They have already acted swiftly and arrested the accused, and let me assure you that I shall ensure that the culprits get the most stringent punishment under the law. The safety of our citizens is always my government’s top priority. “Safety of children, especially minor ones, has to be a shared responsibility. Our right to security has to be strengthened further with more cautiousness. Children, especially minors, need guidance of their elders,” he said. The chief minister pointed out that there is a curfew imposed in the state and that people are restricted from visiting public places. “So when I spoke about a shared responsibility for minor children, it was out of concern, care and love for my fellow citizens and our children. We all love our kids. Being the chief minister, my feeling of concern is extended to all the children of Goa,” he said. “I, both as an individual and as the CM, can never ever directly, indirectly or remotely hurt the sentiments of my fellow citizens of Goa. I put this on record today,” Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/benaulim-gangrape-remarks-taken-out-of-context-sawant/articleshow/84908671.cms||---

Together, they have helped about 600 patients so far by arranging for oxygen cylinders, concentrators, ICU beds, blood etc. They even arranged for plasma donors at various hospitals, including getting 17 donors within two hours for a patient from Bokaro. The duo has now moved on to organising funds for critical patients. “During the peak of the second wave, we worked round-the-clock, making calls and connecting those in need with the required resource persons. Whatever requirements came to us, we fulfilled them. At one point, we were given 40 concentrators by a donor that we distributed for free of cost on rotational basis,” said Manoj Raheja. His daughter, Sanjana Raheja, had been volunteering with some of her colleagues earlier. In fact, it was during that time they received a distress call from a 17-year-old girl from Bhagalpur district. “She was trying her best to save her father who was suffering from liver cirrhosis and needed a liver transplant that would cost Rs 27 lakh. We got in touch with Sonu Sood Foundation through our references and convinced them to fund a part of the treatment. The remaining amount was arranged by us through family, friends and my daughter’s colleagues,” said the father. The beneficiary said that the duo came to her as a blessing, since a crowd-funding initiative started earlier had failed to raise any money. “At that point we were ready to sell our house for my father’s treatment. But no one was ready to buy it because of the Covid-19 scenario. No one was even willing to give us a loan on interest. That’s when I started looking for NGOs and eventually got connected with Sanjana and Manoj uncle,” said Shanu Kumari. Her father’s surgery is complete, and he is now recovering at an apartment arranged by the volunteers. Meanwhile, the father-daughter pair has two more liver transplant patients in the pipeline, who are awaiting funds. “As the second wave is on the wane, we aren’t getting many calls from Covid-19 patients. But since our number has been circulated among many people, other patients — including those in need of a transplant — are reaching out to us. We intend to help as many people as possible. It has now become my passion,” Manoj Raheja said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/funds-to-plasma-this-duo-helps-patients-with-all/articleshow/84906540.cms||Amrita Didyala

Kalra is an accused in oxygen concentrator black marketing case. The court was hearing Kalra’s petition challenging a show-cause notice and order suspending the registration certificate to run the restaurants following his alleged involvement in the case. Justice Rekha Palli said it will be open to the businessman to assail the cancellation order in accordance with law, after the police submitted that a decision has been taken by its licensing wing, after giving Kalra an opportunity to be heard. The court also clarified that it has not expressed any opinion on the claims made in his plea. Kalra had challenged the May 11 order-cum-show-cause notice issued by the joint commissioner of police (licensing) and the subsequent suspension of the registration certificate to run the two eateries in Khan Market. He submitted that the registration certificate was cancelled by the authorities by an order dated July 23 and nothing survived in the petition. In its report filed in court police said a show-cause notice had been issued to Kalra to explain why his premises were used to store oxygen concentrators. In response he claimed that running of restaurant was his source of livelihood and since premises was lying unused and compelled by financial liabilities he stored the concentrators in good faith and as an act of service to the needy. However, the explanation was not found satisfactory, police said and the licences were cancelled. The businessman had contended that the suspension was illegal and contrary to the provisions of the Delhi Eating Houses Registration Regulations as it did not confer power of suspension at the stage of issuance of a show-cause notice. Kalra, who was arrested by Delhi Police in a case of alleged black marketing of oxygen concentrators during the second wave of Covid-19, said that there was no provision to suspend registration certificates merely on the grounds of registration of an FIR. “The order of suspension is also bad as recovery of oxygen concentrators made from the restaurant premises is no ground nor is it given as a ground for suspension of licence. The order of suspension adversely affects the business, reputation and livelihood of all employees working in the restaurant,” the plea said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kalras-registration-certificate-to-run-2-restaurants-cancelled-police-tell-hc/articleshow/84908733.cms||Abhinav Garg

The slum dwellers have been told to pull down the illegal extensions on their own or face demolition. BMC officials said the illegal extensions were carried out largely at Janta Colony, which abuts Worli Koliwada, along the sea. “During our regular inspections, we found several structures had illegally extended into the sea. Earlier this week, we issued notices to the violators to remove them or face action,” Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner, G-South ward, said. “We will demolish the extensions and in case of repeat offence, we will prosecute the owner or tenant under the Maharashtra Region and Town Planning Act.” TimesViewIllegal construction by reclaiming the sea must be immediately halted. It will also put the lives of the residents in danger in case there is a high tide or a cyclone. The BMC must take stern action against those who have carried out the unauthorised construction. However, the corporation must ensure that residents with relevant permissions and documents are not harassed unnecessarily.State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray is the MLA from Worli. Officials said the illegal extensions were carried out beyond the sea protection wall near Golfa Devi Temple, which could be risky especially in case of a cyclone. “In the last one year, 15-20 new illegal structures have come up on reclaimed land here. These huts have power connection and are rented out for huge sums,” said a local. But the residents, who received the notices, claimed their huts were legal. “We have not carried out any illegal constructions. Our homes were built in the 1990s and we have been getting electricity bills. The state has declared our homes as protected structures as the area is a part of the Worli Koliwada touching the sea next to the Navy compound,” Kishore Velye, a resident of Worli Koliwada, said. “On Friday, we visited the BMC and submitted all our documents. We are also part of a proposed SRA society.” Velye added: “The huts have not crossed the protection wall, in fact, it was built through the slum pocket. We are against any illegal constructions and the BMC must take action against them, if any, but the demolition action is inhuman.” Ughade said that he has asked civic staffers to verify the date when the structures were constructed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-notices-for-illegal-constructions-on-reclaimed-land-at-worli-koliwada/articleshow/84910196.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

He said the floods occurred due to Goa receiving incessant and heavy rainfall for days together. “Because there were such claims, we sent out WRD engineer Dilip Naik to check. He went there and Supa dam is not even filled to capacity. I have photographs to prove it,” said Sawant. He asked MGP MLA Ramkrishna Dhavalikar not to make such unverified claims. tnn “15 to 20cms of rainfall was received in the Mhadei and Khushwati catchment areas within three days. This much of rainfall is usually spread over more than a month. In places where there are bandharas, trees got stuck and led to the water level rise,” said Sawant, adding that the WRD has already prepared a preliminary report on the floods. The CM also said that excess water from the state dams was also not released during high tide as claimed by Dhavalikar. “The way the excess water is released from reservoir. You cannot release it at high tide from Tillari reservoir, which led to flooding in Pernem,” said Dhavalikar. Sawant responded stating that such comments are not expected of a senior legislator like Dhavalikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/floods-not-due-to-water-from-supa-dam/articleshow/84908734.cms||---

She was convicted on July 24 by the special sessions court for MP & MLA cases at Nampally and also fined Rs 10,000. The MP had filed an appeal against the trial court order before the high court. Her counsel Zeeshan Adnan Mahmood argued before the high court that the only basis for conviction as per the trial court judgment was the alleged confession made by an accused in the presence of the police which as per the law laid down by the Supreme Court was inadmissible evidence. Mahmood also claimed that apart from the alleged confession there was no other evidence on record linking her to the accused or to the alleged offence. It was also contended that Section 188 of IPC was added to Section 171-B by the investigation officer only to exercise powers under Section 155 (2) and as the trial court had already acquitted her of the offence under Section 188, the connected case was devoid of any basis. The judge suspended the sentence and posted the case for final hearing. The suspension of sentence would be in operation till the disposal of her appeal before the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-stays-trs-mps-jail-sentence-for-poll-bribes/articleshow/84906591.cms||---

However, the CM’s assurance on Friday — a day after the Assam government issued a travel advisory to its residents against travelling to Mizoram — coupled with his reiteration from his Twitter handle that “NorthEast India Will Always Be One” came even as his government refused to withdraw its armed policemen deployed at Vairengte town on the outskirts of Cachar (Assam) border. Mizoram’s insistence on deployment of its police force at the border, despite strong pressure from the Union home ministry during the talks held between the chief secretaries of the two neighbouring states in Delhi on Wednesday, continues to be a roadblock in putting the border areas under the central armed police force (CAPF).

A senior Mizoram government official said on Friday that while there was no need to deploy a large number of policemen in the camp during peacetime, repeated aggression and encroachment by Assam police contingents necessitated reinforcements as was done on July 26 — when 200-strong Assam armed police personnel, headed by IGP of Assam, stormed the camp without warning or provocation and overran the camp then manned by one section of Mizo armed police.

The official said that they were ready to withdraw a larger number of policemen when there is no tension at the border areas. The reason behind state chief secretary Lalnunmawia Chuaungo’s refusal was Zoramthanga’s strong stance and instruction, the official said.

The chief secretariesThe Mizoram government was adamant during the talks convened by the MHA on Wednesday on the presence of its police force due to the fact that it found it hard to trust and depend on the CAPF to protect the people living along the border, the official said. The state government’s strong objection to the proposal to withdraw its armed police resulted in the second para of the draft minute being changed to: “Further, in order to facilitate the functioning of neutral force, both the government of Assam and the government of Mizoram will work out agreement in coordination with the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India within a reasonable timeframe.” In November last year, as desired by the Union home ministry, the Mizoram government agreed to deploy neutral forces along the border and BSF personnel were deployed in Mizoram and were later replaced by CRPF while SSB jawans were posted inside Assam with an Assam Police camp behind the CAPF. Meanwhile, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma has clarified that the travel advisory issued by the state government was not a ban order on travelling to Mizoram.  “There is no curb on travel. We have advised people to think before going to Mizoram as civilians have arms in their hands and this will continue until the Mizoram government seizes the weapons,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mizoram-cm-says-no-harm-to-anyone-but-armed-cops-stay-put/articleshow/84908513.cms||Prabin Kalita

A year back, the court had refused to take cognisance of offences mentioned in the charge-sheet under Prevention of Corruption Act as sanction was not obtained to prosecute public servant accused, Rana Kapoor. But the court was now informed that sanction had been accorded. The court now held that the trial can proceed against all accused under sections of Indian Penal Code. Kapoor has been regarded as a public servant as he was CMD of Yes Bank as per Banking Regulation Act, 1949. “Perused record, prima face offence punishable under Prevention of Corruption Act is made of against accused Rana Kapoor. So trial is to proceed according to law against him,” the court said. It said prima facie offences under Indian Penal Code sections relating to conspiracy, cheating and criminal breach of trust are made out against all accused. “Accordingly, trial to proceed against them,” the court said. Rana has been in jail since March 2019. The Wadhawans are also in custody.

A total of 1,01,944 people was vaccinated across 426 centres, taking the count of fully vaccinated people to nearly 17.4 lakh. The total doses administered in Mumbai so far has crossed 71.2 lakh. BMC’s additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the city had received 1.8 lakh doses a few days ago and hence should be able to vaccinate comfortably till Monday. The city has been averaging around 70,000 inoculations over the last few weeks, partly due to shortage of doses in the public centres. Maharashtra vaccinated over six lakh people on Friday, an uptick from the average vaccinations since in the past 10 days. Maharashtra has administered 4.3 crore doses so far, the second highest in the country after UP. However, given that the state has an estimated adult population of 8.5 crore, complete vaccination is a long road ahead. A task force member said that the threat of a third wave will continue to loom on Maharashtra till 60%-70% of the population was vaccinated with at least one dose. A state official said the daily vaccination numbers had plunged slightly after immunisation was hit by the floods in western Maharashtra. Data shows that Maharashtra has received around 66 lakh doses, including nearly 10.3 lakh doses of Covaxin in July. It was an increase from around 59 lakh doses received in June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-over-1-lakh-mumbaikars-vaccinated-in-one-day/articleshow/84908776.cms||---
---||Delhi||Discriminatory practice in registration of Muslim marriages: Plea in HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Friday asked the AAP government to respond to a petition alleging that Muslim marriages are being registered under the Special Marriage Act (SMA) and couples are not being given the option to marry under the Compulsory Marriage Order which provides for immediate registration without any delay or prior notice. Justice Rekha Palli issued notice on the petition moved by an NGO, ‘Dhanak for Humanity’, and an aggrieved individual. It granted three weeks to Delhi government to file its reply. The plea contends that exclusion of Muslim marriages from Compulsory Marriage Order was discriminatory in nature. “Petitioner has a point. You can’t discriminate,” the judge responded, seeking the government’s stand. On his part, the counsel for Delhi government stated that he would take instructions in the matter. The petition argues that in spite of the marriage of the second petitioner being a Muslim marriage and not an interfaith marriage, the couple, which escaped from their hometown to solemnise the marriage in Delhi, was being subjected to 30 days’ notice period under the SMA. “Respondent no 1 (State) specifically does not allow registration of Muslim marriage under Compulsory Registration Marriage Order 2014 and Respondent no 1 is bound by law to register the marriage within one day as per Registration of Marriage under Compulsory Registration Marriage Order 2014,” the plea submits, urging the high court to intervene. It argued that the exclusion violates the fundamental rights of the parties and that the requirement of 30 days’ notice period under the Special Marriage Act was a very cumbersome process for someone who has come from another place. “Petitioner 2 has the right to live which has been threatened and curtailed and respondents should protect the same by registering the marriage immediately,” the petition reads. The court will next take up the matter on October 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/discriminatory-practice-in-registration-of-muslim-marriages-plea-in-hc/articleshow/84908770.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He, however, added that the decision of the state task force would be final. “The formal list of the 25 districts will be formally declared by the state disaster management department within the next couple of days. Nashik is likely to figure on the list. But I will not jump the gun before the formal declaration,” Bhujbal told newspersons after chairing the weekly Covid review meeting. District administration officials said the restrictions for this week would continue, as the state disaster management department has not yet declared the list of the districts where the curbs would be relaxed. “In Nashik, the weekly positivity rate is now 2% with a 1.8% oxygen bed occupancy. The state task force will make the formal announcement and we will follow its guidelines,” Bhujbal said, adding that people should exercise caution in terms of social gatherings like marriages. “During my visit to Yeola on Friday morning, I learnt that there were 10-15 Covid cases in a house and the reason was marriages,” he said. The minister ordered institutional quarantine of all the patients in Yeola, his home turf. City-based traders and hoteliers said a relief in the curbs was much needed, as they had incurred heavy losses due to Covid pandemic. Santosh Mandlecha, president, Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture (MACCIA), said, “It has been our demand for the past many days that timings of the shops be increased as the economic activities are affected due to Covid-19 pandemic. The number of daily Covid cases has reduced. At this juncture, the government’s move to ease the restrictions is a relief.” Sanjay Chavan, president, Association of Bar, Hotels and Restaurants (ABHAR), said though the government had announced further relaxations in Covid restrictions, there were some confusions about the timings, especially for bars, hotels and restaurants. “Increasing timing up to 8pm will not improve our business. Around 80% of the business happens after 7pm. It will be a great relief to hotels and restaurants if the timing is increased up to 10pm,” said Chavan. Shailesh Kute, a hotel owner, also said the government should extend timing up to 10pm, especially for hotels and restaurants. Like Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon and Nandurbar are also likely to see some restrictions with the Covid situation stabilising in those districts. Barring Ahmednagar, the situation is under control in most north Maharashtra districts, an official said, adding that these districts are likely to have some relaxations in the norms. In Ahmednagar, the Covid cases are increasing again to the extent that some villages have now decided to go for “voluntary lockdown” to curb the spread of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhujbal-indicates-at-ease-in-nashik-curbs/articleshow/84901278.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Those whose houses have suffered major damages will be compensated with up to Rs 1 lakh and those whose houses have minor damages will get between Rs 25,000 to Rs 50,000. This amount will be sanctioned by September 30, chief minister Pramod Sawant assured in the state assembly on Friday. Sawant said that as per preliminary estimates, damages worth Rs 91 lakh have been reported across the state. The opposition MLAs, however, said that this compensation amount was very meagre and that the state government should instead get houses constructed, through the public works department, for those affected. “It is not just you, I have seen houses collapse right in front of me and the people crying. I have seen a concrete home sinking by one meter. Whoever had a mud house which has collapsed in the floods will get Rs 1-2 lakh by August 15. For major damages, we will give up to Rs 1lakh and for minor damages between Rs 25,000 to 50,000, which will be provided by September 30,” Sawant said. Sawant said that 83 affected families have also been provided with ration kits over the last 15 days. The families of the two persons who lost their lives in the floods were provided compensation of Rs 4 lakh each. “At least 20-25 mud houses have collapsed. As per norms, they would have received Rs 90,000, but we have directly hiked this amount to Rs 2 lakh,” Sawant said, adding that it is not feasible for the government to construct houses as compensation as ‘there were a lot of difficulties’ involved in this. He said that the state is also considering providing compensation for lost goods to whatever extent possible. The CM said that in cases where multiple families were living in a joint home, the possibility would be considered of providing each family a separate compensation amount. The opposition, however, said it was not possible to construct a house with such meagre compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-assures-compensation-of-up-to-rs-2-5-lakh-for-flood-hit-homes/articleshow/84908759.cms||---

The question, which had been postponed during the budget session in March, was scheduled to be taken up during the current session. When speaker Rajesh Patnekar overruled objections raised by the opposition on Friday and called the next question, agitated legislators walked into the well of the House and refused to return to their seats, leading to an adjournment. As such, hardly any business was conducted during the first half of the last day of the monsoon session. The question that became the source of controversy was first tabled in the House during the budget session even as the opposition had accused the government of non-transparency in the appointment of Nagpur-based a XYKno Capital Services Pvt Ltd as consultant to explore the Dongri Tal II coal block in Madhya Pradesh. On Friday, when industries minister Vishwajit Rane sought to further postpone the question to the next session, the opposition vehemently objected. The postponement was allowed by Patnekar nonetheless, amid chaos and allegations by the opposition of a Rs 1,000-crore scam in the coal block matter. The speaker said if the minister sought postponement because information could not be given in public interest, the question could very well be postponed. An irate opposition, however, demanded to know what aspect of the coal block matter pertained to public interest. Citing procedural rule 49(2), GFP chief Vijai Sardesai said, “The question has to be replied on the day it was listed. If information is not available and the minister seeks time, the speaker may allow it to be postponed, but not beyond the sitting of the House.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/house-adjourned-amid-coal-block-pandemonium/articleshow/84908799.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Verdict in Raju Vs Jagan bail case on Aug 25||Hyderabad: Principal special judge BR Madhusudhan Rao of the CBI courts in Hyderabad on Friday reserved his judgment to August 25 in a petition filed by YSRC rebel MP K Raghu Rama Krishna Raju who was seeking the cancellation of bail given to AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy eight years ago in the quid pro quo case. Though CBI took time twice to convey its latest stand on the issue, it could not do so because it did not receive any latest instructions from its higher authorities in Delhi. Its counsel said this in the court on Friday while seeking some more time to convey their stand in the form of written submissions. S Sri Venkatesh, counsel for Raju, opposed the plea and said that they do not approve of the dodging ways of the probe agency. Raju’s principal contention in his plea is that Jagan through his decisions in administration is acting in a manner that is intimidatory and the witnesses cited by the prosecution may feel intimidated to depose against him in the quid pro quo case. “The appointment of several accused in the case in key positions of the government is one such step,” he said. Jagan’s counsel opposed the plea of Raju tooth and nail and described his bail cancellation plea as one that has no relevance to the case or to the facts. The counsel said that Raju started this campaign against Jagan only after the party sought a summary ouster of Raju from Parliament by way of disqualification because he became a tool in the machinations of YSRC’s rivals and was acting in a way that was inimical to the interests of the party. Jagan also branded Raju as an evader of huge loans and an accused in CBI cases related to defrauding banks. The judge too made it clear that he would not give any more time to the CBI to convey its stand. The CBI counsel took some time and reverted to the court saying that they have not received instructions. He said they would prefer to maintain a non-committal stand taken earlier, leaving it to the discretion and decision of the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/verdict-in-raju-vs-jagan-bail-case-on-aug-25/articleshow/84906638.cms||---

The details of the ownership of the London hotel was revealed after analysing documents seized during searches conducted in March on at least 35 premises of the Unitech and associated entities. Following the raids, the ED had attached properties in Gurugram and Mumbai worth hundreds of crores, including a helicopter. The London hotel is registered in the name of Ibournshorne Ltd, an UK-based associate company of Carnoustie group. The probe had revealed that “tainted funds to the tune of Rs 325 crore belonging to homebuyers were diverted by the Unitech to Carnoustie group”. “Out of this, Rs 41 crore was diverted to the UK after layering the transactions through Carnoustie group, India and through Indesign Enterprises Pvt Ltd, Cyprus”, the ED claimed. The Unitech promoters later used these funds to purchase the shares of Ibounshorne Ltd in the name of Carnoustie Management India Pvt Ltd, an entity belonging to Carnoustie Group.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Pandemic fears can’t shackle CBSE toppers from giving wing to dreams||LUCKNOW: Covid-19 pandemic has failed to dampen the spirits of meritorious students of CBSE Class 12 who have decided not to shelve their future plans like studying abroad or moving to other cities to pursue higher education. They said compromising on future would not be a wise decision and following Covid-19 safety protocols religiously was the key to staying safe. “I will pursue BA (Hons) in political science from Delhi University. Staying back home and opting only for local academic institutes due to pandemic will not be a sound decision. If one follows Covid-19 safety protocol and gets a jab, one need not compromise on quality education,” said Jyotsna Yadav of Lucknow Public School (South city branch), who scored 99.4% and aspires to become a civil servant. Abhinav Gaur, who scored 99.2%, said he wanted to become a doctor and would prefer to pursue a course in medicine from any of the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the country. “Pandemic can’t restrict our career growth and opportunities,” he said. “I will pursue BSc (Hons) from Delhi University as there is no option here. Already, pandemic has put us under a lot of stress. We couldn’t appear for the Board examination. I won’t let it spoil my career goals further,” said Shagun Shukla of Eldeco branch of Delhi Public School. She scored 99.2% and wants to become a civil servant. Aspiring to pursue an honours course in psychology from the Kings’ College, London, Hina Naela of GD Goenka Public School, said: “The kind of course and specialization I am looking for is only available at Kings’ College. I will not change my plan even if the third wave arrives. My future depends on the college I opt for.” Vansh Jain of St Francis College, who scored 99% marks, said pandemic might subside in a few years but if he compromised on the choice of college, it would affect his future. “Every student wants to pursue higher education from colleges that have good NAAC grading and NIRF ranking. In Lucknow, there is hardly any such institute. I don’t have any other option than to leave the city to fulfill my computer engineering dreams from one of the IITs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pandemic-fears-cant-shackle-cbse-toppers-from-giving-wing-to-dreams/articleshow/84908786.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Dehradun||Rare orchid found for 1st time in India in Chamoli||NAINITAL: A rare orchid species that was previously unreported in India has been found blooming at an altitude of 3,800m in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district. The surprise find was made by the forest department which was scouring the area to collect orchid varieties for a conservation centre that has come up in the state. Last year, TOI had reported that the team had sighted another rare species in the country after a gap of 120 years. Flowers of Liparis Pygmaea — a deep shade of purple — were found in the Western Himalayan Region in the same area in August 2020. Before this, the species had been recorded in India in 1896. The latest discovery in Chamoli’s Mandal Valley was made last month and shared with the public on Friday during the inauguration of an orchid conservation centre there. White flowers of the species, Cephalanthera erecta, were sighted by Manoj Singh, a junior research fellow with the forest department. Sanjeev Chaturvedi, chief conservator of forests (research) told TOI that the species was rare and protected under appendix II of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) which deals with species whose habitats need conservation. The centre has been built on van panchayat land in Mandal Valley. It will be looked after by local residents in the region who will be sent to the northeast to undergo training on orchid cultivation. The centre houses over 70 varieties of orchids and is spread across an area of six acres. It includes an orchid nursery and a 1.2km long orchid trail. The forest department said the conservation centre will also help boost research on the plants. “Orchids are very susceptible to climate change so closely monitoring them can help us better understand the changing climate,” said a forest official. Earlier, there were plans to set up the centre in Pithoragarh and initial work had been done, but it was washed away after a cloudburst.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rare-orchid-species-previously-unreported-in-india-found-blooming-at-3800m-in-chamoli/articleshow/84901249.cms||Prashant Jha

The notices were served to the pet shops and breeders after the principal secretary of MAUD, Arvind Kumar directed the GHMC commissioner Lokesh Kumar to take action against all illegal units and shut them down, if they don’t comply with guidelines of the Telangana State Animal Welfare Board (TSAWB). In his letter, the principal secretary lambasted the GHMC for permitting the illegal breeders to operate saying that the civic body allowed them to operate illegally by bringing them under the ambit of pet shops. However, when asked about the illegal breeders and those breeding dogs at home for commercial purposes, the official said, “In GHMC limits there are only 12 breeders. More than 90% of the dog breeders are outside GHMC limits. If people are breeding dogs at home, we cannot designate them as breeders. For breeding there should be kennels, space and there are other rules which need to be followed and that activity will not be tolerated in residential areas. To avoid these, GHMC’s instructions are to get the dogs sterilized.” However, officials informed that while the GHMC can issue notices, as per the Pet Shop Rules, 2018 and Dog Breeding and Marketing Rules, 2017 rules, only the state animal welfare board has the authority to shut down or take any other action against illegal pet shops or breeding units. Meanwhile, Dr Monika, assistant veterinary director, state animal husbandry department said, “We have received applications for registration from 77 pet shops in the city so far and prior to that 67 of them were served notices. Registration applications will be sent to the concerned district official to conduct inspections and give the inspection proforma to V&AH. Only if the inspection report is satisfactory, we issue the inspection certificate. So far, one or two inspections of pet shops have been taken up.”  GHMC has been directed to slap notices against the dog breeders, asking them to apply for registration. Failure to obtain registration by August 15 would mean closure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-to-hunt-down-illegal-dog-breeders-67-pet-shops-get-notices/articleshow/84906696.cms||Moulika.KV

Special public prosecutor Geeta Sharma cited the evidence of five witnesses, including the child and her mother, to seek conviction of the accused. The accused was also fined Rs 15,000. On January 12, 2019, the accused had allegedly come home to take the girl to her grandmother’s place. He allegedly bought two bottles of wine on his way to her home. But he took her to his house instead of dropping her to her grandmother’s home. He then allegedly took her to the attic and forced her to drink the wine after which he sexually abused her. When the teenager got to her grandmother’s house, she narrated the incident. The child’s parents were then informed and an FIR was lodged. The accused was subsequently arrested, but granted bail on June 25, 2020. “The accused was in jail since January 12, 2019 to June 26, 2020, hence, set off be given to him for the period of detention undergone by him during trial,” the court said.

---||Kolkata||Students scoring 90% and above outnumber undergraduate berths in Kolkata||KOLKATA: If all the Plus-II candidates scoring 90% and above—barring those opting for professional courses—seek admission to undergraduate courses in city colleges and universities, not all can be accommodated, feel vice-chancellors and principals. Many principals estimated that there might just be enough seats in reputable colleges and two top universities for only one-third of candidates in this marks bracket. WBCHSE, CISCE and CBSE cancelled their board exams this year and adopted various formulae to compute Class XII final scores. In HS, 100% candidates have passed, while CISCE and CBSE have failed only a negligible number of students. Close to 9,100 HS students have scored 90% and above, while principals have estimated that at least 6,750 from ISC and 5,000 from CBSE are likely to have got similar marks. Though ISC and CBSE have not announced any break-up of results, the estimate is based on feedback from the affiliated schools, many of which said almost 50% of their students scored 90% and above. More than 10 lakh students from the three boards have passed Class XII in Bengal this year but the number of UG seats in the city is less than 2.5 lakh. To put this in context, the intake capacity of Presidency University 700, Jadavpur University 981, Lady Brabourne College 619, Bethune College 540, Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration 549 and Ramakrishna Misison Vidyamandira 202. Even there, the demand is not likely to be for all subjects, with very few takers being predicted for subjects, such as philosophy, Sanskrit and education. “Of the 20,000-odd students scoring 90% and above, a quarter will opt for medical, engineering, law or other courses. Even then, there won’t be enough seats in reputable colleges and universities for the remaining 15,000 candidates,” said the pro-vice-chancellor of a unitary university. Several colleges, like Scottish Church, Lady Brabourne, Loreto, St Xavier’s, and Presidency and Jadavpur universities receive thousands of applications from Northeast students as well. “A sizeable number of students from the Northeast takes admission in our college every year,” said Scottish Church College vice-principal Supratim Das. Though several new universities and colleges have opened in the district, students scoring high marks usually opt for institutes in Kolkata, increasing the pressure here. However, in 2019 and 2020, multiple seats in otherwise sought-after departments at some top colleges here remained vacant for a long time, but that was due to other reasons. Last year, the reason was that high-scorers had blocked seats for inordinately long without taking admission. “Also, unitary universities, like Presidency and JU, publish their results later than other colleges and some students migrate. But by this time, it is too late to for colleges to admit students afresh because a big chunk of syllabus is already over,” said Lady Brabourne College principal Siuli Sarkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/students-scoring-90-outnumber-ug-berths/articleshow/84906688.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Lucknow||Govt warns fertilizer suppliers against forcing farmers to buy other products||Lucknow: In a significant pro-farmer move at the peak of the current Kharif crop cultivation season, the state government has decided to take legal action against fertilizer supplying agencies who force the wholesale stockists to buy products other than essential Urea and Di-ammonium Phosphate. In a missive sent to all district magistrates, additional chief secretary (agriculture), Devesh Chaturvedi said a strong vigil is needed on such agencies which compel the stockist to buy less used fertilizers and other products. The letter dated July 29 mentions initiating legal action if the imposed compulsion is found to be true. Officials said that the otherwise rampant practice is being carried out by tagging lesser known products along with the crucial fertilizers stocks for being passed on to the gullible farmers. UP government’s move to step up vigilance measures vis-à-vis sale of fertilizers to farmers comes amid hard stance of farmer pressure groups like Sanyukt Kisan Morcha — comprising Rakesh Tikait-led Bhartiya Kisan Union — threatening to hold demonstrations across UP before organising a Mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar on September 5 on a host of farmer-related issues. The department has also issued instructions to invoke essential commodities Act, and fertilizer (control) order to penalise stockists allegedly engaged in hoarding of fertilizers to create an artificial shortage. Chaturvedi said that as per rules, fertilizers need to be provided to farmers in a controlled manner and as per requirement so that it could be evenly distributed. The agriculture department has further instructed for selling of fertilizers with the help of point of sale (PoS) machines. At the same time, stocks are physically verified with the ones sold through the PoS machines. Chaturvedi said that teams comprising officials of the agriculture, cooperative and rural development be deployed at various centres to ensure a seamless distribution of fertilizers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-warns-fertilizer-suppliers-against-forcing-farmers-to-buy-other-products/articleshow/84908871.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Notification for polls to Legislative Council in August?||HYDERABAD: Intense lobbying is on for the seven vacant seats in Telangana State Legislative Council with indications that the  Commission of India may issue a poll notification for six seats in August. The ECI has written a letter to the state government asking about the coronavirus situation in the state. It will take a decision on issuing poll notification based on the reply from the government, which sources said is in favour of completing the Council elections. The lobbying for the seven seats is intense as a berth in the Council is guaranteed. The ruling party has enough MLAs to send six of its leaders to council under MLAs quota without a contest. The opposition is unlikely to contest as it does not have numbers on its side. Apart from six MLCs, the term of another MLC M Srinivas Reddy elected under the Governor quota ended on June 17. Earlier, the ECI had postponed the council elections as there was a rise in Covid-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic. The term of six TRS members in the council expired on June 3—council chairman Gutha Sukender Reddy, deputy chairperson Neti Vidyasagar, former deputy CM Kadiyam Srihari, chief whip B Venkateshwarlu, Md Fareeduddn and Akula Lalitha. A senior leader in the ruling TRS told TOI that aspirants are keeping their fingers crossed as KCR made many promises to leaders at the time of their joining TRS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/notification-for-polls-to-legislative-council-in-aug/articleshow/84906744.cms||Roushan Ali

The CM was speaking after digitally transferring over Rs 88 crore to over 40,000 women self-help groups and 2,606 other SHGs from the revolving fund and community investment fund, respectively, under the state rural livelihood mission. He also interacted with a host of beneficiaries. The state government has managed to reach out to 52 lakh families through formation of 4.8 lakh SHGs . Stating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always stressed on economic emancipation of women from the poor families, Yogi said that the state government has managed to not only provide employment, but also raise the living standards of rural women through the SHGs which were roped in various fields, including manufacture of PPE kits, masks, school uniforms, besides engaging them in milk production and stitching of school uniforms for children. The CM categorically emphasised on inclusion of SHGs for collection of electricity bill payments. At present the revenue collection in the rural areas, the CM said, stands at only 30% which needs to be raised to 90%. Meanwhile, the CM Yogi pitched for giving further impetus to Mission Shakti Abhiyan envisaging safety, dignity and self-reliance of women in the state. Reviewing the progress of Mission Shakti at his official residence, the CM said that the campaign has had a positive impact on the society which is becoming more aware about the safety and self-respect of women. A presentation on implementation of the third phase of the campaign was made before the chief minister, who issued directives for limiting the number of departments added in this campaign.

These casualties took place over a one-year span in different parts of Uttar Pradesh, mostly on highways. But no lessons were learnt.Police action followed in two cases — Auraiya, where 26 migrant labourers were crushed to death last year and Kannauj, where six people died in February. In other accidents, no arrests were made after registration of FIRs. In three accidents that claimed 10 lives at Sant Kabir Nagar, Hardoi and Balrampur districts, cops failed to track down errant drivers who parked their vehicles on highways. When TOI spoke to SHO Khalilabad, Manoj Pandey, he said a probe was pending into the Sant Kabir Nagar incident that snuffed out four of a family after their van crashed into a stranded truck on Digha overbridge on May 23. Similarly, in Hardoi, three persons were killed while four others were injured after a car rammed into a stationary truck parked on Hardoi-Shahjahanpur road on December 7, 2020. No arrests have been made till date. At Balrampur, three of a family died after their car hit a stationary truck on October 30, 2020. Here too, police failed to make a breakthrough. No technical evaluation of wrecked vehicles was done or fitness certificates scanned by cops, who were clueless when TOI questioned them on Fridy. Also, there was no effort by police or road department to install signage at vulnerable crossings or turns, as per rules of National Highways Authority of India. Bus challaned 32 times:A probe revealed the Bihar-bound bus carrying 140 passengers was challaned 32 times since 2017. Fines of Rs 27,500 were also pending against the owner.

In the past, they would call and ask customers where they were going and then cancel the ride. Now, the new method is to message through the app,” said Virat Singh, a rider who was hassled while booking an Uber cab from CSMT to Dahisar on Friday evening. An official from Uber messaged the rider saying, “We encourage drivers to complete all trip requests and avoid causing any discomfort to riders. We understand such issues are never pleasant to deal with and truly appreciate you taking the time to give us your feedback. Rest assured, we have made a note of your feedback on our point-based model which will help us to take appropriate actions on the driver’s profile. Appreciate your understanding in this regard.” He recalled that such messages had been given since the past few days. “I got a similar driver a few days back who messaged asking “Where are you going” and today, I got another such message saying “aapka drop kidhar hai (where is your drop)?” This is unwarranted and I have complained to Uber on twitter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/aggregator-cab-drivers-now-ping-for-drop-location-and-cancel-ride-in-mumbai/articleshow/84910268.cms||---

We will take a further call on action, once we get the report,” he added. When contacted, Gupta said, “I do not wish to speak on the issue as of now.” Speaking to TOI, the DCP, at the center of the issue, said, “The audio clip is doctored, and it is an attempt by some vested interest within the city police to frame me in a needless controversy. A part of the clip does contain my voice, but someone has dubbed the remaining part of my voice before making it viral on social media. I have already briefed the police chief about the audio clip and I have sought his permission to register an FIR.” She added, “Ever since I took charge as a DCP last year, I have stopped all illegal activities in areas under the jurisdiction of six police stations in my zone. I even got certain policemen posted at the same place for 12 years, transferred to other postings. The policemen, having vested interest, did not like my action and they have started harassing me. The policemen, who are receiving support from senior police officers, have hatched a conspiracy to defame me in public.” What’s in the viral clip?In the audio clip circulating on social media, a senior woman police officer can be heard conversing in Marathi with a subordinate policeman, asking him to get the best of less oil and less spicy non-veg dishes for her and her husband from a particular popular non-vegetarian eatery located in her zone. She is further heard asking the policeman not to bother much about payment as the same would be taken care of by the police officer in-charge of the area. She also offers to speak to the police officer, but the subordinate is heard saying he will take care of the matter. The woman officer is heard asking the policeman normally what they do in such a situation and the man replies that he is in the habit of paying the bill and collecting food parcels. The woman officer is then heard saying what is the use of paying money if the eatery is located in their zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/home-minister-orders-probe-into-dcps-audio-clip/articleshow/84906856.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Ashok Pandey, director of Ahlcon Group, said the high number of students passing out was not a bad thing. “They all deserve enablers to flourish in life. Good students need not worry that others have got good marks too. Compassionate competition should be the value they all must learn,” he added. Divya Bhatia, principal of Amity International School, Saket, said, “It has been an extremely tough year for everyone. I’m sure getting the results has brought a sigh of relief to all parents and students.

Similarly, the PM SVANidhi scheme, providing loans of up to Rs 10,000 to street vendors, has seen flows of a little over Rs 2,500 crore to 25 lakh vendors, although the internal target was more ambitious, with banks nudged to give loans.  Although the government has announced an increase in the ECLGS limit from Rs 3 lakh crore to Rs 4.5 lakh crore, officials do not expect a major surge, amid demands that eligibility norms be eased to enable more small businesses to use the window. When the scheme was announced last year, it was meant for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), but the scope was enlarged later as the demand was not sufficient. Up to July 2, a little less than 1.1 crore MSME borrowers have been provided guarantee-based support amounting to Rs 1.65 lakh crore, which translates into an average ticket size of Rs 1.5 lakh. Under the originally announced scheme, MSMEs that had loans of up to Rs 50 crore at the end of February 2020 were eligible even with past dues of up to 60 days. MSME industry groups say that the conditions are such that it is difficult for businesses to get a loan. “The requirements were such that only a certain set of entities with existing loans were eligible. Now banks are reluctant to lend. The government should have dropped the condition of prior credit because we are seeing cash flows being disrupted for a lot of MSME units,” said Animesh Saxena, president of Federation of Indian Micro and Small & Medium Enterprises (FISME). Recently, the parliamentary standing committee on industry noted that there is a huge gap between sanctions and disbursals as banks feared defaults in the wake of the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-disburse-over-rs-2-lakh-crore-under-eclgs-till-mid-july/articleshow/84911159.cms||Sidhartha

State DGP Mukul Goel said, the institute will be affiliated to the Gujarat-based National Forensic Sciences University (NFSU) and will function under the ministry of home affairs. Spread over 50 acres in Piparsand locality of Sarojininagar, the institute has been named Uttar Pradesh State Institute of Forensic Science (UPSIFS). Lucknow police commissioner DK Thakur, district magistrate Abhishek Prakash and other senior officers visited the site to oversee preparations for August 1 foundation-laying ceremony. The institute will offer studies in the field of police administration and forensic science. A Center of Excellence is being set up by NFSU to provide modern infrastructure and technology in scientific crime investigation, which will be a separate unit on 5acre land on the campus. A senior police officer said, India would also seek technological aid from Israel, which houses the world’s most hi-tech state-of-the-art facility in forensic science. “The idea to set up an institution, which will not only produce world-class forensic experts, but also have our own centre of excellence to carry out research in crime investigation, cyber security, behavioural sciences and criminology,” he said. To improve policing in Uttar Pradesh, an MoU was inked between Uttar Pradesh State Institute of Forensic Science and APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University in May to introduce artificial intelligence and its applications in digital forensics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shah-to-lay-foundation-of-forensic-inst-in-city-tomorrow/articleshow/84909045.cms||---
---||Pune||Two realtors in Pune face duping charge||PUNE: The Uttamnagar police on Friday arrested Sachin Kulkarni and Nitin Kulkarni, managing director and director of Vastushodh realty firm, respectively, on the charge of duping 18 home buyers of Rs 5.7 crore by failing to deliver possession of flats in a project at Kondhve-Dhavade. Later in the day, the police produced Sachin and Nitin before a magisterial court which ordered their remand in police cusotdy till Saturday. The firm run by the Kulkarnis made a name for itself a few years ago in the segment of budget housing and had undertaken quite a few projects in the city that offered affordable homes to common citizens. Erandwane resident Nivrutti Katurde (49), who lodged a complaint in a representative capacity on behalf of all the 18 affected home buyers, told TOI that he had booked a two-bedroom flat in the scheme in 2015. “The builder had promised to give us possession of flats in three years. For making the down payment and paying the remainder of flat’s price, I had to take loan. I am still paying the EMIs. A lot of construction work is still pending at the site. The land owners are not allowing the workers to go there. We were left with no option but to approach the police,” he added. Lawyer Hemant Zanzad, who is representing the Kulkarnis, told TOI, “The project was delayed due to a dispute between the land owners. One of them has blocked the road leading to the project site and is not allowing the workers to go there. We told the court that we are in the process of solving the issue and will give possessions to the customers in next six to eight months.” Deputy commissioner of police (zone-III) Pournima Gaikwad told TOI, “We have arrested the realty firm’s MD and director on the basis of the registered complaint.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-realtors-face-duping-charge/articleshow/84906914.cms||---
---||Delhi||In race for Delhi University, brace for 100% cutoff in key courses||NEW DELHI: With over 70,000 students scoring 95% and above in CBSE Class XII, results of which were declared on Friday, the discussions and predictions have begun at Delhi University colleges on whether the admission eligibility benchmarks are likely to see a jump. According to some college principals, the CBSE results clearly indicate that the cut-off marks will be elevated this year, with some of them foreseeing even 100% cutoffs for various courses. The pass percentage has seen a big jump over last year from 88.8% to 99.4%. The results also show a surge in the number of those scoring 95% and above. From 17,690 students in this high-score category in the pre-pandemic year of 2019, the number more than doubled to 38,686 in 2020 when several exams were not conducted due to the Covid-19 pandemic and this year has further increased to the highest ever of 70,004. Such high scores mean that there is every likelihood of the 100% cutoffs that first made a mark last year among the colleges, among them Lady Shri Ram College with the full percent requirement for three courses in the first list: economics (Honours), psychology and political science. As for this year, college principal Suman Sharma only said, “It is too early to comment on what the cutoffs will be. The call on the qualifying marks will be taken by a committee, which will consider the Class XII results in detail.” Responding to the news about the large number of high scores, Sharma said, “It is good that students have done well, but I wish there were more colleges to accommodate all of them. The smaller towns should have colleges so that youngsters can stay close to their homes for education and not have to shift to Delhi.” This same thought was expressed by Hindu College principal Anju Srivastava, who said cut-off marks were likely to be inflated in Hindu this year. “We don’t have a choice. While we will assess the results, the number of students with very high percentages is quite high. It is challenging for colleges, and it is disappointing for students that there are limited seats available even when we exceed our capacities.” S P Aggarwal, principal of Ramanujan College, did point out, however, that not all the high scorers would seek admission in DU. “Last year, not too many of those who had top marks came to DU, preferring instead to study nearer their homes because the university classes were anyway online,” Aggarwal said. “We will have to see the DU registration figures to assess the situation and to determine the cutoffs. Yet at the same time, it seems likely that the cutoffs could be 2-3% higher than last year.” In a similar vein, Gurpreet Singh Tuteja, former DU dean of students’ welfare, advised students that with the qualifying marks likely to be very high and with limited seats available, they “should keep all your options open”. He suggested the aspirants should also apply to all universities that hold entrance exams for admission. On July 17, the DU administration said that it would assess the Class XII results, including those of the various state boards, and direct colleges to have reasonable benchmarks. But Rajeev Gupta, chairperson of admissions, also admitted that “it is quite possible that colleges will have high cutoffs due to the high percentages scored by Class XII students”. The total number of students scoring 95% and above is nearly same as the number of seats offered by the university. However, DU always has more students applying for admission than the number of the seats available, with colleges like Hindu and LSR seeing takers for all the seats available in courses like political science and psychology even if the cutoffs in the subjects have been over 99%, even 100%, in the past few years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-race-for-du-brace-for-100-cutoff-in-key-courses/articleshow/84909051.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

Halth minister Rajesh Tope had stated that Covid restrictions would be relaxed in 25 districts of the state. But Pune was among the 11 districts that were kept out of the list because of Covid-19 indicators higher than the state average. The government is yet to issue the final order of relaxations. For the 25 districts, it has been agreed that shop timings could be extended to 8pm The Sunday curbs would continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/call-on-ease-in-pmc-pcmc-areas-in-a-couple-of-days/articleshow/84906951.cms||---

The agency said that Kishnaram’s contacts are also under the scanner. Three persons — Jogaram Saran, the principal of a government school in Barmer, Thakararam, owner of Mother Teresa Senior Secondary School in Barmer, and Kishnaram, a middleman, were arrested on Thursday. The agency had also seized the bribe amount of Rs 20 lakh which was returned by the middleman after he failed to keep his promise of ensuring 70% marks to the ‘beneficiary’ in the RAS interview.“Kishnaram had tampered with his mobile phone when he learned of the ACB action, his mobile phone will be examined,” Soni said.The bribe was given in order to secure over 70% marks for the candidate, Harish, a relative of Thakararam.

He misused Tilekar’s name and made calls to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials to offer a bed to his father,” sub-inspector Prabhakar Kapure said. He said a PMC official became suspicious of the caller and he contacted Tilekar to verify if he had called him from a particular number. “After the former MLA denied making phone calls to the official, he got to know that the man had posted Tilekar’s name and details on a caller identification application,” he said. “Tilekar had filed a complaint application soon after the incident. During the preliminary inquiry, the suspect told the police that he had misused Tilekar’s name with an intention to get a bed for his father.

The leader of the opposition, who led a delegation of RJD, Congress and the Left parties MLAs and met Nitish on the last day of the monsoon session of the state legislature, said the CM will write a letter to the PM in this regard on his return from Delhi on August 2. Barring BJP, all the political parties, including the JD(U) to which Nitish belongs to, want the Centre to hold general caste Census in the country. “Accordingly, the CM has agreed to lead a delegation of all-party legislators to PM Modi to apprise him of the two unanimous resolutions adopted by the state assembly in 2019 and 2020 for a caste Census in the country,” Tejashwi said, adding that this gesture on the part of Nitish will uphold the dignity of the Bihar legislature. “The delegation led by the CM will also plead with the PM that the Centre also conduct the caste Census of the OBC, EBC and other sections,” Tejashwi said. Incidentally, the Centre had recently informed the Lok Sabha that a general caste Census will not be conducted in the country, even though the one of the scheduled caste (SC) and scheduled tribe (ST) groups will be held. The BJP has been averse to holding the general caste Census in the country. Apprehensive that the Centre might not agree to holding the general caste Census, Tejashwi said they impressed on Nitish that the state government itself could hold the caste Census on the pattern of Karnataka with its own resources. “The CM was also favourably inclined towards it, even though he did not know how the Karnataka government had done it. Accordingly, the CM said he would first collect relevant documents from Karnataka and also look into the legal aspects of it, before taking the final call,” Tejashwi said. Holding of the caste Census was important not only for the government but also for the people of the state, as they would come to know their relative numerical strength. It would help the government in policy formulations in a more focused manner for the uplift of the weaker sections, the RJD leader said. Nitish himself did not disclose what transpired in his talks with Tejashwi and the delegation comprising Ajeet Sharma of Congress, Mahboob Alam of CPI(ML), Ajay Kumar of CPI and Ram Ratan Singh of the CPM, besides Lalit Kumar Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav from RJD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-will-seek-meeting-with-pm-on-caste-census-issue-says-tejas/articleshow/84901585.cms||Abhay Singh

Devotees were not allowed to enter the garbha griha because it is constricted and people had to offer prayers from outside.

---||Kolkata||Flyers, crew wade through water to reach Kolkata airport||KOLKATA: A marooned 1sq-km stretch of VIP Road and Chinar Park on the New Town's main arterial road — neck-deep at places — crashed traffic movement to and from the airport on Thursday. And it wasn’t just flyers left stranded in the two-to-three-hour-long traffic snarl and ultimately missing their flights, even pilots and airline crew were caught up in the situation, leading to flight delays. According to sources, no flights took off on time after 11pm and till evening, around 50 odd flights were delayed. “Several passengers were delayed and our customer care phone lines were flooded with calls from anxious passengers while stuck in traffic outside the airport. Crew and captains of multiple flights were stuck in the traffic as well, which led to delay in departures,” said an airline official in Kolkata. Although airport authorities couldn’t provide data on the total number of no-shows, a top airline official said: “A good number of passengers missed their flights across airlines. A large number of passengers were also rescheduled to flights later in the day or some other day.” Passengers complained it took them anything between one-and-a-half to two hours to cross a 5km stretch between Baguiati and airport as vehicles crawled along the inundated VIP Road. At least 30 cars and three government buses had broken down in the area that further choked the traffic. Several passengers left cabs and walked till the airport while some were seen reaching the terminal on bikes. “I had planned to celebrate my father’s 70th birthday with him at his north Bengal home. My flight was at 12.30pm and I had started well in advance from my Southern Avenue home. I was stuck on VIP Road for two-and-a-half hours. By the time I reached the airport at 1.30pm, the flight was already gone,” said Nishi, who booked another ticket for Saturday. Waterlogging in Chinar Park and on the service road stretch at Haldiram More has been a long-standing problem in this part of the city. After two days of heavy rain, it was relatively dry on Friday but there was no sign of storm water receding from the area. In fact, cops had to seal the road between Chinar Park and Haldirams and a stretch of Airport-bound VIP Road after a number of vehicles started breaking down there. “There was nothing much we could do. We tried our best to divert traffic from New Town through Joramandir and Rajarhat Road and airport-bound traffic on VIP Road was made to ply on a single lane of the Kolkata-bound flank. But there was so much water everywhere and vehicular movement was excessively slow,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate’s traffic department. Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation officials said water from Haldirams crossing can be flushed out only after the water from Chinar Park recedes. But with Bagjola canal overflowing, water from Chinar Park couldn’t be pumped out there. It was only after water from Bagjola canal started receding in the late afternoon that the work could begin, a civic official said.

---||Pune||Soon, access all vaccination information on one platform||PUNE: A central government official with the portal management team confirmed on Friday that linking the entire Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) under the ministry of health and family welfare to CoWIN is in the works. “The ministry provides several vaccines to infants, children and pregnant women through the programme. Discussions are on to integrate the entire programme with CoWIN as it is likely to have almost 80 crore registrations in the next few months after Covid-19 vaccination for children is started. This means that not just Covid inoculations, but all vaccinations provided under UIP could be brought on the CoWIN platform,” the official told TOI. “The CoWIN platform is ready with tie ups with private and government hospitals, a vaccinator app, third party providers and it also has the technology to send due dose alerts to beneficiaries, in this case mothers, as is done for Covid vaccines. This means that children and mothers immunized in the programme would also have digital certificates after receiving their shots,” the official said. He added that with crores of registrations on CoWIN, a database of beneficiaries with mobile numbers has been created, which is one way to integrate UIP with CoWIN. Experts said that citizens currently undergoing vaccination under UIP do not have access to a digital system through which they can check their vaccination records, with only manual cards being available as vaccination records. Dr Naveen Thacker, president-elect of the International Paediatric Association (IPA), said, “At present, children’s immunization records are only on a manual paper card. It is the need of the hour that we digitize the vaccination records, which is why the entire UIP system should be integrated with the COWIN platform.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/soon-access-all-vaccination-information-on-one-platform/articleshow/84907003.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Delhi||Combined system for weather alert, air quality||New Delhi: India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday launched an integrated ‘Early Warning System’ for Delhi-NCR, which will give both weather and air quality-related observations and warnings. A new portal will allow better utilisation of weather-related data and better forecasting. The early warning system webpage will also have real-time weather updates such as temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction. While Delhi had an ‘orange’ alert in place for Saturday, rain largely gave the capital a skip. Only drizzle was recorded in some locations. The meteorological department says a cyclonic circulation in south Haryana shifted the impact on Saturday to Rajasthan and only light rainfall is expected on Sunday as well. A spell of heavy rainfall is expected in some locations on Monday. Released by Dr M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences, the system will also use data from Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi Pollution Control Committee, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. “The data of 58 air quality and weather monitoring stations and 9 IMD weather stations have been included in the urban meteorological system from Delhi-NCR. Radar and satellite observations are also provided for the region specifically,” said IMD in a statement on Saturday. The webpage can be accessed at https://mausam.imd.gov.in/Delhi/ Delhi has received 507.1mm so far in July at Safdarjung, its base station. The normal mark for the month is only 210.6mm. In comparison, Delhi only recorded 236.9mm of rainfall last July. On Saturday, Safdarjung recorded no rainfall, while Ayanagar recorded only ‘trace’ rainfall. Najafgarh recorded 1.5mm of rainfall. “While an orange alert was in place, a cyclonic circulation in south Haryana meant activity was concentrated towards Rajasthan. This will weaken Sunday’s rain spell too, however, we can expect moderate to heavy rainfall on Monday morning,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD. Delhi also enjoyed ‘satisfactory’ air quality on Saturday, with the Air Quality Index recorded at just 57. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’ and 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’. The capital is yet to record a ‘good’ air quality day so far this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/combined-system-for-weather-alert-air-quality/articleshow/84933630.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Uphill task: Merging 2 ‘first dose’ certificates on CoWin||PUNE/MUMBAI: Merging two first dose certificates of Covid-19 vaccine is turning out to be an impossible task for several beneficiaries, with CoWin not accepting such requests due to differences in spelling of names or errors in other parameters on either of the two certificates, a central official with the portal management team said on Friday. Many vaccine beneficiaries got their first dose by registering from one cellphone number and second dose after registering from another number. Though such users have now completed their vaccination schedule, they have received two first dose certificates as they signed up with two numbers. To avoid this, ministry of health and family welfare had introduced an option to merge two first dose certificates on CoWin to get a final vaccination certificate. A 40-year-old doctor from Ghatkopar recently told Rajawadi Hospital that the certificate was showing same dates for her first and second doses. “We could resolve it,” said Dr Vidya Thakur, medical superintendent. Another vaccination centre head said, “Many who received a single dose have got a final vaccination certificate in place of a provisional one. It becomes difficult for them to get a second dose,” he said. “I received two first dose certificates despite using the same phone number for registration. Somehow, vaccination staff at the hospital updated the wrong beneficiary reference ID during the second dose. So, both my certificates have a different beneficiary reference ID. I tried merging the two certificates on CoWin, but the request was rejected,” said Pune ophthalmologist Dr P K Saraf. Another Pune resident has been unable to merge the two certificates since days now after using different phone numbers for both doses. “While registering on CoWin the second time with a different phone number, I made an error punching in the gender. Both certificates now show a different gender and my request is being rejected.” A central official with the CoWin portal management team said, “When an attempt is made to merge two certificates, details like beneficiary’s name, gender, age, reference ID are checked to see if they match. If they do not match, the request does not get through.” The official said nearly 31 lakh requests on CoWin’s ‘Raise an issue’ feature have been resolved, while 10,000-odd are pending. “We are looking into such issues and will relax some conditions so that such requests get through,” he said.

---||Surat||Two domestic help steal valuables worth Rs 18 lakh in Gujarat||SURAT: Two women working as domestic help were booked in connection with theft of Rs 18 lakh from a bungalow in New City Light area on Thursday by Khatodara police. Kajal and her aide Pinky for stealing jewellery worth Rs 16 lakh and Rs 1.78 lakh cash from the cupboard inside the house. The complaint in this regard was lodged by Pinal Jariwala, a resident of Vasant Vihar Society. Jariwala and her husband Sanjay, a textile unit owner, had gone out to buy some product on July 26 and on return, they found the valuables and the domestic help missing. Investigation revealed that the Jariwalas had hired Kajal just four days before the theft. Police collected CCTV footage from the area to identify the two women. Cops are making efforts to verify if the women were arrested in the past for a similar crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/two-domestic-help-steal-valuables-worth-rs-18l/articleshow/84905632.cms||---
---||Pune||Merging two ‘first dose’ certificates an uphill task for many in Pune||PUNE: Merging two first dose certificates of Covid-19 vaccine is turning out to be an impossible task for several beneficiaries, with Co-WIN not accepting such requests due to differences in the spelling of names or errors in other parameters on either of the two certificates, a central official with the portal management team said on Friday. Many vaccine beneficiaries got their first dose by registering from one cellphone number and second dose after registering from another phone number. Though such users have now completed their vaccination schedule, they have received two first dose certificates on account of having signed up with two different phone numbers. To avoid such a situation, the ministry of health and family welfare had introduced an option to merge two first dose certificates on Co-WIN to get a final vaccination certificate. Ophthalmologist Dr PK Saraf told TOI, “I received two first dose certificates despite using the same phone number for registration. Somehow, the vaccinating staff at the hospital updated the wrong beneficiary reference ID during the second dose administration. So, both my certificates have a different beneficiary reference ID. I tried merging the two certificates on Co-WIN, but the request was rejected.” Another Pune resident, who did not wish to be named, said, “Several states, including Maharashtra, have eased interstate travel for the fully vaccinated. So, the final certificate is very important. However, I have been unable to merge my two certificates since days now. I had used two different phone numbers while getting both the doses. While registering on Co-WIN the second time with a different cellphone number, I made an error punching in the gender. Both certificates now show a different gender and my merging request is being rejected due to this.” P Ghosh (56) has been facing a slightly different issue. “I had received just one vaccine dose, but what Co-WIN issued me was a ‘final vaccination certificate’, instead of the ‘Provisional first dose certificate’. Now I am facing problems in getting my second dose because Co-WIN shows that I have already received the final certificate. There is no option on Co-WIN to rectify this odd error,” Ghosh told TOI. A central official with the Co-WIN portal management team said, “When an attempt is made to merge two certificates, details like beneficiary’s name, gender, age, reference ID are checked to see if they all match. In case they do not match, the merging request does not go through.” The official said nearly 31 lakh requests on Co-WIN’s “raise an issue” feature have been resolved, while only 10,000-odd grievances are pending. “We are looking into such issues and would relax some conditions for them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/merging-2-first-dose-certs-an-uphill-task-for-many/articleshow/84907031.cms||Neha Madaan

Principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) and chief wildlife warden P K Sharma said, “We have framed a relocation policy and a survey would be done shortly to decide on compensation to villagers.” The reserve has three core areas—Dudhwa National Park, Kishenpur Wildlife Sanctuary and Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary. The buffer is formed by forest divisions of North Kheri, South Kheri, Shahjahanpur and Katarniaghat. The villages lie between forest patches. Biotic pressure is up after a population boom in villages, triggering a man-animal conflict. Residents of Chaltua and Kamp Tanda, both inside Kishenpur Sanctuary, have been demanding relocation for years. And so are residents of Bhartapur, but the process failed to take off. Forest department officials who campaigned for the cause say relocation is a long-drawn process, which includes convincing villagers to move out. In 2009-10, residents of Chaltua and Bharatpur were ready to relocate, but there was no follow-up by administration. Another effort was made in 2015-16, but did not pay off. The relocation proposal has to be forwarded by administration to forest department. Over the years, foresters have tried to initiate the process at individual level. “Earlier, villagers agreed to compensation of Rs 10 lakh to relocate, but the amount needs to be increased now,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/14-villages-in-dudhwa-reserve-to-be-relocated/articleshow/84909086.cms||Neha Shukla

The move comes days after the state issued a notification framing rules under West Bengal Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Rules, 2021. The twin notifications follow the SC order a couple of months ago that struck down the state legislation West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act, 2017, as unconstitutional. The setting up of the authority will enable home buyers to seek cancellation of agreements if projects are not delivered on time and get back the money invested along with interest if the appellate authority is satisfied the builder has not complied with the agreement. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-sets-up-realty-monitoring-authority/articleshow/84907014.cms||---
---||Delhi||Tweaks that helped CBSE ensure quick and ‘fair’ results||NEW DELHI: A comprehensive system to help schools tabulate and moderate marks and a results committee with two external members were two among a number of steps adopted by the Central Board of Secondary Education to ensure the final assessment of Class XII students, hampered by cancellation of written exams due to Covid-19, was fair to the youngsters. According to the board, the specially developed software that had 30 crore fields to be filled in by the schools across India, was the game changer. The alternative assessment policy for the board exams was accepted by the Supreme Court on June 17. Then, in order to ensure that the results were declared on time, CBSE organised webinars that were attended by around 50,000 teachers and provided continuous assistance in the form of email replies, messages to the schools and a helpdesk at the examination department. “For the successful implementation of the tabulation policy within the scheduled time frame, it was important to facilitate the work to be done by the teachers,” explained Sanyam Bhardwaj, CBSE examination controller. “So, in order to help the schools in the compilation and moderation of results and reduce any inadvertent errors on their part, a comprehensive and feature-rich system was developed, in record time too, by a team from the board under the leadership of Dr Antriksh Johri. This portal not only helped schools in verifying Class X information, but also in uploading the internal grades, practical marks and the theory marks of classes XI and XII.” The system also automatically calculated the weightage at each level. For the final tabulation, the portal had two stages: first to upload the Class XI theory marks and calculating its 30% weightage. The second was to upload the Class XII marks and calculate the 40% component. The system also calculated the Class X component of the eventual scores. “The system also aided schools in uploading Class X scores of non-CBSE candidates whose data couldn’t be accessed from the board concerned and calculating the 30% weightage,” said Bhardwaj. “The system also guided the moderation every time marks were entered so that the schools did not make mistakes. There was then an automatic calculation of the overall mean marks based on data and moderation given by the schools vis-a-vis earlier performances.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tweaks-that-helped-cbse-ensure-quick-and-fair-results/articleshow/84909155.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Some vaccination units closed in Kolkata, but special drive pushes up jab count||KOLKATA: Despite the inundation at several places, the state logged the best vaccination record for the week on Friday. The number of doses administered already had crossed the 3 lakh jab mark with 3,07,560 doses administered till reports last came in. While health officials engaged in transporting vials from the vaccine warehouses to different CVCs navigated through the flooded streets and vaccination teams braved inundation to reach their centres, people queued up outside CVCs as early are 4am at many places. “There were also portal issues for close to one-and-a-half hours in the afternoon, slowing down the vaccination pace. The number will go up slightly once pending data are entered,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar. Due to the heavy rain the previous night and the subsequent waterlogging on Friday in many parts of Kolkata, the vials could not reach some centres or the consignments reached very late. Consequently, people had to wait for several hours. Some of them even had to go back without the jab. Many health clinics located in wards were inaccessible for almost the entire day as the roads leading to them were inundated. “We have a vehicle that is used to bring the vaccines to our centre. But people who go to fetch the vaccines could not come to the centre. Water entered the clinic for which we had to suspend vaccination for the day,” said an official at the clinic in Jorasanko. In many cases, the health workers could not even reach the centres due to waterlogging. “The lady who administers the vaccine comes from Titagarh but she has not been able to come because of the rain,” said a centre head at Chattawala Gali off New CIT Road. At many big centres, like School of Tropical Medicine and Medical College Kolkata, vaccination started after 11.30am. “Our people reach the depot late. Waterlogging also caused a lot of delay,” said an official of STM. Despite all the odds, the state could achieve the target of 3 lakh doses a day on Friday. On Monday, health officials had told all CVCs to maximise their target as the government now has a comfortable stock to administered 3 lakh plus dose a day. “We got an additional 8.2 lakh Covishield doses and 59,170 Covaxin doses on Friday. So in all, we have received 80 lakh plus doses this month against the earlier estimate of 75 lakh doses for July. If we keep getting vaccines uninterrupted, we should be able to pick up better speed,” said the official. A few days ago, chief minister Mamata Banerjee during her Delhi visit had urged Narendra Modi to allot more vaccine for Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/some-units-closed-but-spl-drive-pushes-up-jab-count/articleshow/84904548.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation begins structural audit of CoEP jumbo unit||PUNE: Operations at the College of Engineering, Pune (Co-EP) were likely to continue as the civic body recently started the structural audit of the facility. The contract for the hospital had ended on July 15. The structural stability of the facility would be checked and improved based on the auditor’s suggestions. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had stopped admissions to the jumbo unit, but it decided that the facility should continue because of the possibility of a third wave. “The utility of the jumbo facility was discussed in a meeting. The elected members, including the district guardian minister, were of the opinion that the jumbo unit should continue to be there. Dismantling it will not serve any purpose and if we have to rebuild the unit it will be costly. So as of now, we are of the opinion that the unit should remain,” said Siddharth Shirole, MLA of the Shivajinagar constituency. PMC officials said the demand for beds, oxygen and ventilator-supported beds went down in July. So, the empty facility was closed down. Now, the firm operating the facility may be told to continue their contract. But, a final decision is yet to be taken. “The process of conducting the structural audit has started. The report is expected in a few days. A decision about likely improvements and hospital operations will be taken after receiving the report,” said Ravindra Binwade, the PMC’s additional commissioner. The jumbo unit has a 800-bed capacity. Of them, 700 were occupied during the peak of the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-begins-structural-audit-of-coep-jumbo-unit/articleshow/84907018.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

The injured person was identified as A Vasanth Prabhakaran of Ayyarpadi area in Valparai town. “He was returning home from his sister’s house on foot around 10.45pm when the bear attacked him. Locals rescued the injured man and rushed him to the Pollachi Government Hospital, from where he was shifted to Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH),” a forest department official said. Valparai forest range officer K Jayachandran and team conducted a sensitization programme at Ayyarpadi area and Valparai town on Friday. They requested residents not to step out after sunset and early morning hours. Jayachandran also requested tourists not to venture out on streets at night. “We distributed pamphlets at Ayyarpadi area and Valparai town and requested people to co-operate with the forest department to prevent man-animal conflict,” he said. After a bear killed K Mohanraj, resident of a private coffee plantation at Villoni lower division on Tuesday around 8.30pm, the forest department has placed a cage to catch the animal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/valparai-man-injured-in-bear-attack/articleshow/84907025.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Door-to-door vax drive for aged starts, 37 get the shots at home||MUMBAI: An 83-year-old Meera Barve broke into a smile when the nurse injected her with the vaccine on Friday. Since the pandemic broke out in 2020, the octogenarian has met her daughter, who lives 200kms away in Dapoli, just twice. The last time a few months ago, she sat at arm’s length wearing a mask. “I was eager to get vaccinated,” said Barve, hoping to meet her daughter more often now. Barve was among 14 bed-ridden inmates at the Home for the Aged in Jogeshwari (east) to be inoculated on day 1 of the door-to-door immunisation drive. A total of 37 people from K east ward, including slums in Chakala and Sakinaka, were vaccinated by members from NGO Project Mumbai and civic teams who criss-crossed the city’s second most populated ward in an ambulance. All recipients had to produce a fitness certificate and a consent letter. TimesViewDoor-todoor vaccination is a great initiative to take immunisation to the last person in the community. However, some of the requirements such as a fitness certificate or a physician's letter endorsing the health condition of a bed-ridden person may be challenging to obtain. The state and the BMC must be open to tweak the norms based on feedback and experiences emerging from the real world.The drive started with Daya Joshi (79), a resident of Vijay Nagar in Andheri E, who has been rendered immobile by her heart condition, diabetes and weakness. Her son, Dr Nitin Joshi, said everyone in their house was fully vaccinated except her. “It’s a great initiative and people should sign up without fear,” he said. Friday’s drive will be reviewed to start it across Maharashtra. For now, producing a fitness certificate and ensuring the presence of a doctor for the 30-minute observation period appear to be the biggest hindrances, said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. While over 200 requests for home vaccination have come from K east, barely 25-30 were able to arrange a fitness certificate, said Dr Urmila Patil, ward’s medical officer of health. Under the guidelines, those interested in home vaccination must also provide a consent letter. Dr Niranjan Wagh, who runs the Jogeshwari home along with wife Sumangala, a nurse, said barring a few inmates, almost all families have given their consent for vaccination. “Since the pandemic started, we have cut down physical visits from relatives. We hope with vaccination things will be closer to normalcy,” he said. At least a dozen vaccinations were carried out in slum colonies inside Sakinaka, Chakala and MIDC, said Shishir Joshi, founder of Project Mumbai. Of the four vials opened, barely a few doses were wasted, said Joshi, as they had micro-mapped the ward to save travel time. “We are calling people beforehand and asking them to keep documents ready. From Monday, we intend to vaccinate 50-75 people daily,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-door-to-door-vax-drive-for-aged-starts-37-get-the-shots-at-home/articleshow/84910291.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Pune||Weekly or fortnightly review in 11 districts of concern, says Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Friday told TOI that there would be weekly or fortnightly review of the situation in the 11 districts that were not included in the list of those where the Covid norms would be relaxed. With Covid cases in Maharashtra plateauing for over a month now, the state government on Thursday approved easing of curbs in 25 of 36 districts, but Pune was among the 11 kept out because of Covid-19 indicators higher than the state average. Tope said an official order on the arrangements was expected in a day or two, but there should be a close tab on the 11 districts. “Relaxations can be given to these districts only if there’s a marked decrease in active cases after a weekly or fortnightly review in accordance with the state task force’s suggestions. The proposal will be again reviewed on August 15,” he said. Of the 36 districts in the state, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Pune, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur, Solapur, Beed and Ahmednagar with Covid indicators above the state average have not been proposed for the relaxations. The minister said close monitoring of the weekly positivity rate in these districts was a must.  State task force member and technical adviser Dr Subhash Salunkhe has called for an intensive surveillance and genome sequencing in the districts of concern. Dr Salunkhe said even the 25 districts that would get the relaxations should be monitored very closely for mortality and weekly positivity rates, genome sequencing, surveillance for SARI and increase of cases, especially in the rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/weekly-or-fortnightly-review-in-11-districts-of-concern-says-tope/articleshow/84907040.cms||Nisha Nambiar

IIT Ropar has also decided to conduct research and analysis work on such issues. They have also sent names of three of their experts, who will conduct the analysis and research. The civic body authority already has an environmental expert on the technical committee, who will stay till the last phase of the exercise to upgrade the plant as per discussion and decision in the general house. Since there are strict norms of the Central government and National Green Tribunal (NGT) is also monitoring the exercise, environmental issues have become core issues. Dr Suman Kumar, assistant professor of the electrical engineering department of IIT Ropar will conduct analysis of the impact on environmental parameters such as water, air and soil besides other works related to machines and survey of existing waste. Dr Narinder Singh, associate professor of the department of chemistry will analyse waste material to explore the possibility of thermal degradation besides other works. He will also explore the possibility of use of gas generated as fuel for the pyrolysis process. Dr Indramani Dhada, assistant professor of department of civil engineering, IIT Ropar will analyse the gas and leachate from the various processes. IIT Ropar has named their core experts, who will include aforesaid issues while preparing the DPR (detailed project report) and RFP (Request For Proposal) for the MC to upgrade the plant. Sources in the civic body authority said, “since IIT Ropar experts have come to the city and visited the plant, they have gotten a rough idea.

Officials said most infections in the recent past have turned out to be high–risk contacts (HRC) of Covid patients. D ward comprises Breach Candy, Peddar Road, Nepean Sea Road to Grand Road, Tardeo and parts of Girgaum. Prashant Gaikwad, assistant municipal commissioner of the ward said D ward had been reporting around 14-15 cases, but for the past three to four days, cases have been hovering around 24-28 a day. “We have been aggressively testing and have found that most of those infected have been among high-risk contacts. As vaccination has progressed considerably, we plan to check how many of those infected were vaccinated to study if there is a pattern,” said Gaikwad, adding active Covid cases in the ward are currently around 250. Officials said travel could also be a reason for the spike, especially since many were getting themselves tested as part of work protocols. Nandini Chabbria, office-bearer of the Breach Candy ALM, said many of those getting infected could be those who are not yet vaccinated or those who have lowered their guard after a single shot. “Travel has definitely gone up like it did after the first wave had subsided. The BMC must compel all essential and non-essential shop-keepers to ensure all their staff are vaccinated. They could also be asked to place a board outside their shops declaring vaccination status of their staff,” she said.  “It’s important for people to act responsibly and quarantine themselves,” said Mukul Mehra of the Nepean Sea Road Citizens Forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-high-risk-contacts-lead-covid-spike-in-sobo-ward/articleshow/84910313.cms||Richa Pinto

Kalai Vendan, forest range officer, confirmed that they hadn’t sighted the crocodile in the river on Friday. “Since it is a carnivorous, we have alerted the local public.” Pointing out that it was very rare to find crocodiles in the hill retreat, he said there were reports of sighting a crocodile in a stream in Bitherkad forest range in Gudalur division some five years ago. According to Kalai Vendan, Athikannu river is a collection of perennial streams in Pandalur forest range. “The crocodile wouldn’t have come from atop the hills.

Overall, 53 new cases were reported out of more than 18,000 tests conducted in the last 24 hours and 49 patients recovered in the day. Now, 581 patients are under treatment in the region. Out of them, 193 are in Nagpur district alone. This means, other parts of Vidarbha, especially rural areas, have very less number of patients under treatment. Now, the Covid caseload of Vidarbha has reached 11,14,814, out of which 10,92,899 have recovered. The recovery rate of the region is 98%, which is better than state and national average. Overall Covid test count in Vidarbha reached above 18,000 on Friday. With 53 of the samples testing positive, the test positivity rate or TPR is still under 0.3%.

Recently, the board wrote to the UT deputy commissioner’s office, asking for the list of remaining eligibile slum dwellers from Colony no 4 for their rehabilitation. A senior CHB official said they were providing flats as and when they got the list from the DC office. The land is currently occupied by slum-dwellers, who will be rehabilitated by the administration in Maloya under the slum-dwellers’ rehabilitation scheme. While the UT administration has already rehabilitated over 2,500 eligible beneficiaries as per UT estate office survey, 2006, around 500 persons are yet to be rehabilitated. In a recent meeting chaired by UT adviser Dharam Pal, directions were issued to the UT deputy commissioner’s office, Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) and Municipal Corporation, to complete the exercise to vacate prime land of Colony no 4 and rehabilitate remaining eligible beneficiaries in Maloya. The UT estate office and CHB have already given flats to 2,482 eligible slum-dwellers in Maloya under the slum-dwellers’ rehabilitation scheme.The colony has more than 5,000 houses. Eligible allottees will have to pay Rs 800 as licence fee every month for 20 years, after which they will pay the balance to get ownership of the flat. Sources said that the slum dwellers, whose claims were disputed, would be shifted to flats in Maloya constructed under the Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs) scheme of the Centre. Allottees would be required to pay a monthly rent of Rs 3,000, which would be increased biennially by 8%. The total rental period would be maximum of 25 years. Sources added that if the disputed cases became eligible at a later stage, the UT administration would charge a license fee of Rs 800 with retrospective date. Construction of flats in Maloya started in June 2014 at a cost of Rs 250 crore. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was to hand over keys of flats to allottees in May 2019, but could not do so as the project was incomplete. It was originally meant to be completed by 2016. CHB is the nodal body for construction of rehabilitation colonies. So far, it has built 12,736 of the 25,728 flats proposed. Of these, around 12,000 were built in Sector 38 (W), Sector 49, Dhanas, Mauli Jagran-II and Ram Darbar. The administration rehabilitates slum-dwellers after conducting a biometric survey. Colonies resettled over the last 10 years include Colony No 5, Nehru Colony, Kuldeep Colony and Mazdoor Colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chb-allotts-nine-flats-to-colony-no-4-residents-more-to-come/articleshow/84904683.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: AICC general secretary Ajay Maken hints at dropping some ministers in cabinet reshuffle||JAIPUR: AICC general secretary Ajay Maken on Friday gave enough indication that some ministers in the Ashok Gehlot government may be dropped in the impending cabinet reshuffle and given responsibility in the party organisation. Maken, while talking to media after the executive committee meeting of the party, said a few ministers expressed desire to work for the organisation in his one-on-one meeting with them. Thanking them, he said, he himself had opted out of the Union ministry to work for the party in 2013. Maken had held one-on-one meeting with 115 MLAs of the party and some Independent MLAs supporting the government on Wednesday and Thursday before the executive committee meeting. The MLAs were asked a set of questions included conduct and performance of district in-charge ministers, the implementation of government schemes in the state and in their constituency, name for district and block presidents, name for political appointments, what else required to be done to retain power in the state. Each MLA was given about eight to10 minutes. On the feedback from MLAs, Maken said, “I was told by every MLA how amazing development work has been carried out in their constituency, be it education, health, roads, hospitals. All MLAs are satisfied,” he said. The major concern how the party could retain power in the 2023 election where the state had a history of changing government in every five years. “We mainly discussed how we can bring back a Congress government in 2023. In the state executive meeting also, we discussed that there should be better coordination between the government and the organisation so that together we can bring the Congress back to power," he said. Apart from the MLAs, Maken spoke separately with Gehlot, Pilot, state unit president Govind Singh Dotasra and speaker C P Joshi. The party worried over the factional fight in the state unit between Sachin Pilot and Gehlot faction. The MLAs had emphasized on fostering unity in the party with political accommodation and better coordination between government and the party organization. The party MLAs instead of highlighting the achievements of the government have been quarrelling among themselves giving fodder to the opposition and negative publicity to the party and government. Maken has been holding extensive consultation to appoint district and block presidents which were lying vacant for the last one year after Sachin Pilot was removed from the post of party president. The executive of the PCC is also not completed. Maken had a luncheon with the chief minister before leaving for Delhi in the afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/maken-hints-at-dropping-some-ministers-in-cabinet-reshuffle/articleshow/84907164.cms||---
---||Faridabad||Bill tabled in Lok Sabha to form air quality management panel in Delhi-NCR||NEW DELHI: The government on Friday introduced a Bill in the Lok Sabha to replace the Ordinance on the constitution of the Commission for Air Quality Management in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas, exempting farmers from hefty penalties of up to Rs 1 crore and jail terms for stubble burning but retaining a provision for “environmental compensation”. The proposed legislation is meant for setting up a Commission on Air Quality Management (CAQM) to address the entire range of issues related to air pollution in Delhi-NCR through policy decisions, monitoring and enforcement of existing laws to mitigate the problem. The CAQM is currently functional, drawing its powers from an Ordinance. Farmer unions, meanwhile, continued to protest as the government has retained the provision of imposing and collecting ‘environmental compensation’ from “farmers causing air pollution by stubble burning, at such rate and in such manner, as may be prescribed” in the Bill. Though farmers would be spared from the penalty and jail terms up to five years, which apply to other polluters such as industries, power plants, transport and construction sector, there could be fines by way of ‘environmental compensation’, the rate and modalities of collection may be prescribed in the rules of the legislation once it becomes an Act. Farmer unions have been demanding dropping of penalty provisions ever since the Ordinance was first promulgated in October last year. The Centre, in view of the demand and the agitatition, had tweaked the Ordinance in April when it was re-promulgated. It dropped the penalty provisions and took a lenient approach by introducing ‘environmental compensation’ clause as Section 15 — which the farmer unions now picked up to express their anguish. After introduction of the Bill by environment minister Bhupender Yadav in Lok Sabha amidst continued Opposition protests, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) — the joint platform of farmers’ unions agitating for repeal of farm laws — termed the move (Section 15) unacceptable saying it is akin to “reneging on commitments already made”. The unions do not appear to be satisfied even as Section 14 of the Bill clearly noted that penalty provisions “shall not apply to any farmer for causing air pollution by stubble burning or mismanagement of agricultural residue”. The stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana is a key reason for a spike in air pollution levels in Delhi-NCR during the onset of winter, which coincides with paddy harvest season in these states. The government had justified taking the Ordinance route to set up the CAQM when the Parliament was not in session, arguing that the step was necessary for “effective management of air quality” in the NCR and adjoining areas spread over four states — Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/bill-tabled-in-ls-to-form-air-quality-mgmt-panel/articleshow/84913669.cms||Vishwa Mohan

In 2010, the university grants commission (UGC) had recommended the retirement age for college teachers as 65. In 10 states, the retirement age for college teachers is 65 and in another nine it is 62. Justifying their demand, ACTA general secretary S Sahaya Sathish said the average age when teachers get regular service in government and aided college is 40 and they hardly remain in service for 20 years. While NET is the minimum qualification, they should also have PhD and teaching experience for getting regular service which takes extra years for them to become eligible. “In Central universities, the retirement age is 65 and when teachers cross the age of 60 they are the best minds with rich experience,” said Sathish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/plea-to-set-retirement-age-as-62-for-clg-teachers/articleshow/84904796.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Cluster buses new blueline? 19 crushed already this year||NEW DELHI: Cluster Scheme buses are the new Bluelines, so to say. The two back-to-back incidents in Dwarka that caused the death of four people have brought the focus back on these buses. Delhi Police data reveals that Cluster buses have been involved in 18 accidents that took the lives of 19 people this year till July 15. Last year, these buses were involved in 20 accidents with a toll of 22 lives, though till July 15, there were a fewer nine fatal accidents, perhaps due to the strict Covid-19 lockdown. On Tuesday night, a Cluster bus, which is a vehicle run privately but paid by the government to run on certain clusters, had a head-on collision with a Swift car carrying four people. While three of them died, one of them is being treated for injuries. Police investigations revealed that the bus was driving at high speed while taking a turn when it collided with the car. The bus driver fled from the spot but was later arrested. The following day, another Cluster bus collided with a motorcycle. According to officials of the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System Limited (DIMTS), which oversees the operations of the Cluster buses, the motorcycle skidded and came in the way of the bus. “Both the accidents were unfortunate and the drivers surrendered to police. They have now been debarred from the Cluster system,” claimed a DIMTS official. Admittedly, DTC buses too have been involved in eight fatal accidents this year causing the death of nine people. Heavy vehicles such as containers, tankers have also killed 77 people in 70 road accidents. Muktesh Chander, special commissioner (Traffic), said, “Traffic police officers have been imparting training to bus drivers and informing them about the rules and regulations, including about speed limits. We will continue to educate as many drivers as possible. After every accident, a traffic officer inspects the scene of accident to ascertain what was the cause apart from overspeeding and faulty overtaking.” DIMTS officials said they planned training for Cluster bus drivers in all depots with the help of Delhi Traffic Police. “All depots will be covered. Fortnight safety checks are organised for driving quality check and safety compliance in buses,” disclosed a DIMTS official. “The drivers involved in any fatal accident is permanently debarred from operating buses in 100% cases. For all infractions, a heavy penalty is levied. In the current cases, the speed was around 32kmph.” He added that Cluster bus drivers have to meet statutory requirements after online verification of their documents, antecedent verification as per police report, medical test, eyesight check, colour blindness check, ITDR training and inhouse training. All buses are fitted with an inbuilt speed governor and the pace is also monitored via GPS. In case of overspeeding detected during live tracking, both the vehicle and driver are withdrawn from service. The bus undergoes recalibration before the next deployment. The driver has to undertake a refresher course. In case of a repeat offence, the driver is withdrawn from active duty for seven days and again undergoes IDTR training. If found overspeeding once more in the same month, the driver is put off duty for a month. Timing schedules are strictly implemented and stoppages at the designated bus stops are meticulously monitored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cluster-buses-new-blueline-19-crushed-already-this-year/articleshow/84907287.cms||---

The FIR was filed after Delhi High Court passed an order on the plea filed by the mother of the deceased last week. Earlier, the cops from Hari Nagar Police Station had carried out an investigation into the incident and had “rearrested” four accused in the case, who had been in judicial custody in Tihar Jail. “CBI has taken over the said case and an investigation is under way,” said RC Joshi, CBI spokesperson. An undertrial prisoner, Srikant Swami, who was lodged in jail number 4, was arrested on charges of dacoity, robbery and attempted murder. On May 14, a brawl was reported inside the cell, following which Swami was assaulted by other inmates. The jail guards later intervened, and Swami was taken to a hospital, but was declared dead at Safdarjung Hospital. Swami’s mother had filed a plea before the high court, requesting an investigation into her son’s death. It came on record during the inquiry that most of the CCTVs on the jail premises were not functional, hence, the alleged assault was not caught on camera. The family of the deceased had alleged involvement of jail officials into the murder, which CBI would investigate. Next week, CBI is expected to record the statements of the jail superintendent and the guards who were on duty on the day of the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cbi-files-fir-in-tihar-inmates-murder-on-hc-directions/articleshow/84909271.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Over 1,500 children went missing during pandemic in 2020, reveals study||JAIPUR: A total of 1,555 cases of missing children were reported in Rajasthan between January-July 2020. In 85% cases, missing children were girls. In absolute numbers 1,323 girls went missing in the first six months of 2020, revealed a status report by Child Rights and You (CRY) on situation of missing children during Covid-19 pandemic. In its status report ‘Covid and Missing Childhood’, CRY has analysed data accessed from Rajasthan police and ministry of women and child development (MCWD). The survey was conducted for World Day Against Trafficking in Person which revealed that in Rajasthan on an average five children were reported missing per day between Jan-July 2020, out of which four were girls. Rajasthan was among the five northern states from which CRY drew the inferences including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana. Both primary and secondary data were used in the status report to analyse the status of missing children during Covid-19. Secondary data were accessed through the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) Annual Report ‘Crime in India’ (2015-2019) to understand the trends of previous years. Explaining the relevance of the status report, Soha Moitra, regional director, CRY (North), said, “Children who go missing are often an easy target of human trafficking and the current situation of pandemic has only made it worse. Implications of pandemic in terms of loss of life and livelihood, rise in school dropouts, child marriages, children orphaned due to Covid related death of parents/guardians has added to the vulnerability of children of being trafficked. The data acquired from Rajasthan police and MWCD suggests extremely concerning trends related to missing children in the state.” The report said that despite strict nationwide lockdown and increase police presence at borders as well as streets 316 children went missing in the state in the month of April and May out of them 91% (288 in absolute number) were girls. The situation only went worse after unlocking with the number of missing children cases rising to 359 in just one month. The number of traced and found children was also less during the lockdown months in Rajasthan. Least number of children were traced/found in March, April and May of 2020. With 7 % of children found/traced in April, less than half of the number of children was found/traced in February, said the report. The data acquired from MWCD gave an insight on age wise segregation of missing children cases in the state. Elaborating the age wise trend of missing children cases in Rajasthan Moitra said “The trend which raises concern is that the highest number of children who went missing were of age group 12-18 years. Out of total number of cases 73% children were of age 12-18 years. What’s more alarming is maximum missing children in this age group were girls (82%)”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/over-1-5k-children-went-missing-during-pandemic-in-2020-study/articleshow/84907201.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

While she was nominated as committee convener by governor Banwarilal Purohit, former VC of the university M Rajendran was nominated by the state government to the committee. Since two nominees of syndicate and one of senate were already elected in June, the committee’s constitution is now complete. V Jeyadevan, a retired professor of the university, was elected as senate nominee. M Selvam, head of commerce and financial studies at Bharathidasan University, and T Padmanabhan, former VC, Tamil Nadu teachers education university, Chennai were elected as syndicate nominees. In the next few days, the committee will issue notification seeking applications for the post of vice-chancellor. Since the three-year tenure of incumbent vice-chancellor C Subramanian is ending in October, it is likely that the selection may happen before he steps down. “The selection process may take a period of three months as one-month time will be given to applicants to submit applications from the date of notification,” said one of the committee members. It will require at least two months to process the applications and prepare the list of eligible candidates and conduct interview thereafter for the top few before nominating three names to the governor for appointment as vice-chancellor, said the member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/ex-hc-judge-to-head-search-panel-for-tamil-univ-vc/articleshow/84904810.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Potential high scorers may have taken a hit: Schools||Nagpur: Though the passing percentage of CBSE XII students was almost 100%, the issue many schools felt was that some of their top students could have scored higher. CBSE will be giving a chance to the students to appear for a physical exam if they are unhappy about the marks received now. TOI spoke to some principals from Nagpur, but none wanted to be identified citing apprehension about how CBSE will react. A principal, whose school offers science stream, said, “The pass percentage statistics of 99%-plus can be very misleading. It is basically just telling you that X number of students passed, but it does not reveal how well they performed. Students can pass even by scoring 35%, 40% or 95%. So, the range is very wide and with the media focusing only on pass percentage, this issue has not been picked up properly.” Another principal said in the next two or three days, they expect parents to start reacting. “In every school, there are three to five students with immense academic potential. They can very easily be city, district or even state toppers. It’s these small group of students who have probably lost out in this internal marks tabulation policy,” said the principal. “A student who could have easily scored 99% has got 98%, and it’s this small gap which makes a huge difference during admissions. And going by the experience, I can tell you that parents of such high achiever kids are very aggressive about marks,” the principal added. A senior teacher said, “When such students appear for the final theory board exams, the level of preparation and focus is unprecedented. That cannot be found in their Std XI scores or internal assessments. And frankly, till at least January 2021, we were all convinced that board exams will be held in offline mode only.” “The virus was stagnant and everything was opening up, including schools, so the mindset of students had changed completely. But then, just two months later the scenario was completely different and nobody would have imagined cancellation of exams. Hence, I feel it’s unfair for the brilliant kids,” said the teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/potential-high-scorers-may-have-taken-a-hit-schools/articleshow/84902045.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||Nagpur youth made CBSE’s viral, record-breaking results meme||Nagpur: For the first time in its social media history, CBSE announced XII results by posting a meme which went viral for its humorous content. Actor Amrish Puri is seen looking skywards with folded hands and a big smile, saying “Aakhir woh din aa hi gaya (finally the day has arrived)” — a quip on the anxious wait for students. The meme broke all retweet and like records for CBSE within hours. Only a handful knew that its creator is a youth from Nagpur. For Taha Uddin, Friday was a special day not only because his post for CBSE was making waves across the country, but also because it was his 22nd birthday. “I started working on creatives for CBSE just a couple of days ago. This is, in fact, only the third meme I made for them,” said Taha. CBSE’s meme post on results declaration had received over 33,000 likes and almost 8,000 retweets within four hours of being pushed online. Taha said, “The brief from CBSE was very clear; they wanted to announce that results have come but then the message had to be delivered in a way which connects with the youth.” Taha’s first meme for CBSE, posted on Friday, too got a good response and grabbed public attention. “It was about anxiety of parents and students wanting to know when the results will be declared. Actor Manoj Bajpayee’s Family Man-2 is popular, so I showed him calling Chellam sir asking when results will come. And Chellam replies coolly, saying it will happen soon,” said Taha. No wonder even that post got over 13,000 likes. Another meme posted on Friday has the iconic ‘Babu bhaiyya’ of Bollywood movie Hera Pheri fame reminding students that one should keep roll numbers handy while checking results online. Taha said, “The punchline was ‘bilkul ricks nahi lena ka’, in which the word risk was misspelt to sound exactly like actor Paresh Rawal would have said it.” Taha is no stranger to trending tweets as someone who creates content for Nagpur police’s Twitter handle. His tweet on spacecraft Vikram Lander’s crash took the country by storm and was featured on national news channels. Taha’s tweet, on behalf of Nagpur police appealed to Vikram to respond and promised that it “won’t be fined for breaking signals”. The tweet’s humour helped break the tension during the wait for Vikram to respond to its Earth station, hoping that it hadn’t crashed while landing on the moon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-youth-made-cbses-viral-record-breaking-results-meme/articleshow/84902121.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The approval was given on the basis of a proposal from the department of history and tourism studies, TNOU. As per the proposal, Pudukottai is rich in archaeological remains dating back to over 3,000 years and a detailed study will unravel more interesting facts related to the region. TNOU archaeology department assistant professor E Iniyan, who is the excavation director, said he will submit a report to ASI through TNOU by the end of September. Epigraphist and historian Kudavayil M Balasubramanian carried field work in Porpanaikottai and identified several materials. He was followed by Pudukkottai archaeological research forum (ARF) who also went to the high court stressing on the need to carry excavation around the Sangam era fort in Porpanaikottai. “This is perhaps the only fort in Tamil Nadu belonging to sangam era and hero stones with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions found in the fort dates back to second century CE,” said Karu Rajendran, president of the forum. While broken earthen pots were found in 2016, about 14 furnaces made after drilling rock surface that stand testimony to the extraction of metal from its ore during the Sangam era, he said. Minister for environment, youth welfare and sports development Siva V Meyyanathan who inaugurated the excavation work in Porpanaikottai assured all possible support to the excavation work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/archaeological-field-exploration-begins-in-porpanaikottai/articleshow/84904875.cms||---

---||Delhi||The river wild: Yamuna crosses danger mark, flood alert issued||NEW DELHI: With the combined effect of more water being released from Hathnikund barrage and heavy rainfall in the upper catchment area, the Yamuna level crossed the danger mark of 205.33m around 11am on Friday. The level at Old Railway Bridge was rising steadily and the flood forecast by Central Water Commission (CWC) stated that it was expected to touch 205.6m by 11pm on Friday. An alert was sounded in low-lying areas by the district administration, while the irrigation and flood control department deployed 13 boats at different locations to meet any emergency. Another 21 boats were put on standby. Announcements on loudspeakers were made throughout Friday warning residents not to go near the swollen Yamuna and keep children and animals away from the river. The flood control room stated that discharge rate at Hathnikund Barrage peaked to 1.6 lakh cusecs on Tuesday afternoon, the highest this year. The released water usually takes 2-3 days to reach Delhi. A senior official said the situation was being constantly monitored and the discharge rates at the barrage ranged between 20,000 and 37,000 cusecs. On July 12, just 18 days earlier, DJB had stated that the Yamuna level had been recorded at the lowest since 1965. Witnessing a progressive rise, the water level at Old Railway Bridge was 205.1m at 6am, 205.17m at 7am, 205.22m at 8.30am and 205.34m at 11am. It rose to 205.56m at 7pm, which is 0.04m above the danger mark. Officials said with continuous rain in the catchment area and an orange alert sounded in Delhi, the levels were likely to rise further. Data from the flood control room showed that the flow rate at Hathnikund was 37,109 cusecs on Thursday morning. The normal flow rate in the non-rainy season is 352 cusecs. The Old Yamuna Bridge has been placed in the “orange alert” category, which means there is a possibility of flooding in the area. Vehicular movement on one carriageway of Loha Pul was barred. A CWC official said the river was showing a rising trend and forecast the level to touch 205.6m by 11pm on Friday. “It could rise further as more water gets released. Localised rainfall could also be playing a part,” added the official. Delhi had recorded 72mm of rainfall on Thursday at Safdarjung, Delhi’s base weather station. On Friday, it received 42.8mm of rainfall till 5.30pm. Moderate to heavy rainfall is expected on Saturday, moderate on Sunday and moderate to heavy on Monday, which could result in water levels rising further in the coming days. Generally, a warning is issued when the river crosses 204.5m and preparations are made to relocate people living on the floodplain. Water levels have been known to touch 207m in the recent past too. The highest ever water level recorded in the Yamuna was 207.49m in 1978.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/the-river-wild-yamuna-crosses-danger-mark-flood-alert-issued/articleshow/84909330.cms||Paras Singh

The organisation pointed out the lack of a mechanism to prevent human trafficking and eradication of bonded labourer. “There is no proper law to conduct the case trials expeditiously, get them compensation and rehabilitation measures here,” said state organiser R Karuppasamy. Though Bonded Labour (Abolition) Act had been enacted in 1976, the governments stated that they claimed to have identified 3.13 lakh bonded labourers till now. The NGO and other stakeholders identified many times higher than this number. The process of issuing release certificates to rescued bonded labourers was also slow.

The man has been identified as Naveen (40), while the woman’s name was withheld. “Both the hands of the man were tied with the electric wire and electric current was passing through his body. The woman’s body was found touching the man’s body,” a senior police official said. The woman’s family told police that the two knew each other for around one-and-a-half years. Naveen was also undergoing psychiatric treatment. The cops added that both the deceased are from Bihar. The woman had gone back home on July 22 while Naveen had visited home on May 22.

Students have taken their grievance online with trending tweets trying to grab attention of authorities. Just over 60,000 private and ‘patrachar’ (correspondence) candidates had registered for the 2021 XII board exam. CBSE has announced that offline exams for these candidates will be held between August 16-September 15. Twitter is abuzz with those calling for CBSE to cancel the physical mode of exams due to continued concerns over health and safety. Some students protested outside CBSE’s office in Delhi and posted photos on Twitter to amplify their message. User @AnshalJanbandh4 tweeted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying, “sir apne bola tha ki covid-19 ke chalte class 10th & 12th ki sabhi exam cancel ki gyi hai,but ye @cbseindia29 wale bolte h ki jo private candidates h unki exam hum lege hi. kya hum iss desh ke bhavishye nhi hai?

Are we not the future of the nation, why this injustice for us?).” User @pnknydv wrote, “Cancel cbse private students exams and promote them just like regular students so that they don't loss one year.” User @secret_eyess expressed disappointment by tweeting, “No hopes left.. this is so disheartening.. we did all we could.. but still they didn't changed their decision. Why always private candidates has to face such injustice.” The issue had reached the Supreme Court too, where CBSE submitted that offline theory exams of private students need to be conducted.

---||Delhi||Delhi HC seeks Ramdev’s view on lawsuit filed against him by doctors||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Friday sought yoga guru Ramdev’s stand on a lawsuit by several doctors’ associations for allegedly spreading misinformation by his statements against allopathy amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Justice Hari Shankar, however, refused to pass any interim stay and granted a week to Ramdev to file his response to the plea, which claimed that he had created public nuisance. “Public nuisance has some consequences on the defendant. It is open to the defendant (Ramdev) to say that there is no case. Can’t say that I won’t give him an opportunity,” the judge said, adding that the issue “requires some debate.” Senior advocate Akhil Sibal, appearing for the associations, argued that to grant permission to institute the suit, the court had to only look at the plea before it and need not seek the other party’s response. Senior advocate Rajiv Nayar, representing Ramdev, said the plea was “a second bite at the cherry” and opposed the grant of leave. The court granted time to Nayar to file his response and said the matter would be heard next on August 10. The associations before court are three Resident Doctors’ Association of All India Institute of Medical Sciences at Rishikesh, Patna and Bhubaneswar, Association of Resident Doctors, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, Union of Resident Doctors of Punjab (URDP); Resident Doctors’ Association, Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College, Meerut and Telangana Junior Doctors’ Association, Hyderabad. They alleged that Ramdev was misleading and misrepresenting to the public at large that allopathy was responsible for the deaths of several people infected by Covid-19, and insinuating that allopathic doctors were causing deaths of the patients. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-ramdevs-view-on-lawsuit-filed-against-him-by-docs/articleshow/84909416.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Move to integrate universal immunisation with CoWin||PUNE: A plan to link the entire Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) that includes vaccines given to infants, children and pregnant women to CoWin is in the works. Confirming the development, a Central government official in the portal management team told TOI on Friday, “The ministry of health and family welfare provides several vaccines to infants, children and pregnant women through the Universal Immunisation Programme. Discussions are on to integrate the programme with CoWin as it is likely to have almost 80 crore registrations in the next few months after Covid-19 vaccination for children begins. This means that not just Covid inoculations, but all vaccinations provided under UIP could be brought on the CoWin platform.” UIP includes vaccines like BCG, DPT, OPV, measles, hepatitis B, among others. “The CoWin platform is ready with tie-ups with private and government hospitals, a vaccinator app, third party providers and it also has the technology to send due dose alerts to beneficiaries, in this case mothers, as is done for Covid vaccines. This means that children and mothers immunised under the programme would also have digital certificates after receiving their shots,” the official said. He added that with crores of registrations on CoWin, a database of beneficiaries with mobile numbers has been created, which is one way to integrate UIP with CoWin. Experts said citizens currently undergoing vaccination under UIP do not have access to a digital system through which they can check their vaccination records, with only manual cards being available as vaccination records. Dr Naveen Thacker, president-elect of the International Paediatric Association (IPA), said, “At present, children’s immunisation records are only on a paper card. It is the need of the hour to digitise vaccination records, which is why the entire UIP system should be integrated with the CoWin platform.” He further said that at government centres, ASHA workers create a list and remind mothers by going to their homes two days before a dose is due. “Since the process is largely manual, any lapses in the list affects the programme. In the private sector, Indian Academy of Paediatrics has put in place a system called ‘IAP-ImmunizeIndia’ to remind registered beneficiaries automatically.” As per experts, children’s immunisation in India is provided largely through public sector, via outreach sessions held at anganwadi centres and sub-centres. The private sector contribution remains relatively low.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-move-to-integrate-universal-immunisation-with-cowin/articleshow/84910338.cms||Neha Madaan

The Sangh members were protesting non-implementation of Rajasthan Fees Act 2016 by the private schools in state. Around 100 members of the organization gathered in front of the Shiksha Sankul gate and demanded that either they all be allowed to go inside the premises or the district education officer should come and meet them. District education officer Ram Chandra Pilaniya, while talking to TOI said, "It wasn’t possible to accommodate so many people in my office so, I went outside to meet them. Everything was going on peacefully, parents were putting forward their demands, then suddenly one Yuvraj Punjabi threw ink on me. This was so disrespectful and I didn’t expect this from parents who claimed to be fighting for a cause." Seven members were immediately arrested by the police officials from Bajaj Nagar police station who were also present during the incident. Ramesh Saini, SHO, Bajaj Nagar police station, said, "Parents threw ink on district education officer and on my shirt. It was all pre-planned as one of the parents admitted later on when we arrested them. They are still in the police station and district education officer has lodged an FIR against them for obstruction in lawful work." The seven arrested members include—Arvind Agrawal, Abhishek Jain, Manoj Sharma, Dipesh Bhiyani, Mahesh Kumar, Bal Chand Sharma and Yuvraj Punjabi. Other parent organizations have opposed the behaviour of members of Sanyukt Abhibhavak Sangh. Sunil Yadav, president of Rajasthan Parents Forum, said, "This was a shameful and disappointing act by some people defaming all the parents in the city. I really believe this will impact our image and in future no official will talk to us."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/7-from-parents-assn-held-for-throwing-ink-on-district-edu-officer/articleshow/84907455.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Hit by exorbitant cost of fuel, MSRTC proposes 17% fare hike||PUNE: State transport minister Anil Parab has said that the fare of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses needs to be increased as the state transport body was facing an additional burden of Rs 2 crore per day due to the high fuel cost. The MSRTC has proposed a 17% fare hike, which will be discussed at a cabinet meeting in August, said Parab, adding that he was hoping for a green signal to the proposal. “The MSRTC is suffering a loss of over Rs 4,000 crore due to the pandemic. Some steps need to be taken to offset the losses,” Parab said. The MSRTC has a fleet of 18,000 buses and almost all of them run on diesel. “There is a committee headed by senior officials of the state transport department and the fare hike proposal has been sent to them,” Parab added. Another official told TOI that any hopes of a revival were dashed by the second wave of the pandemic. “The number of daily buses on the road came down by 46% in June compared to January. The number of passengers in June dipped by almost 70% compared to January. The daily earnings of the MSRTC were less than half in June as compared to January. We earned decent income from October last year to March this year. But it dipped again in April and May. The losses are mounting,” the official said. Daily commuters were upset by the fare hike proposal. “Even if the MSRTC is running on heavy losses, it has got the backing of the state government. A 17% fare hike is huge and will create additional pressure on us,” said businessman Samant Pawar, who travels frequently between Pune and Mumbai. The last time that MSRTC had hiked fares was in June 2018. The fares were increased by 18%. Increased prices of fuel were stated to be among the main reasons for the hike at that time. Fuel prices in Pune and in almost all cities of the country has seen a frequent hike since January this year. In June, the price of a litre of petrol crossed the Rs 100 mark in the city, while diesel crossed the Rs 90 mark in May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hit-by-exorbitant-cost-of-fuel-msrtc-proposes-17-fare-hike/articleshow/84907449.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Delhi||Submit status report on illegal constructions near Qutub: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has asked South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to submit a report on the status of illegal constructions around Qutub Minar and fix responsibility on officers who have permitted it. Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva also directed SDMC to ensure that none of the illegally constructed properties are permitted to be occupied, if not already occupied, and sought the presence of the deputy commissioner (south zone) before the court on the next date of hearing on August 20. “Let a status report along with complete details of properties which have come up in the vicinity of Qutub Minar unauthorisedly be filed along with action taken supported by the photographs. Municipal Commissioner (South Zone), Delhi is directed to fix the responsibility of the concerned officers who were supposed to monitor the area and who have permitted these illegal/unauthorised constructions to be carried and submit a report,” the judge said in his order made public on Friday. The court’s direction came on a petition filed in 2018 by one Rinku Kaushik alleging a vast illegal and unauthorised colony being developed on land adjoining Qutub Minar, a world heritage site, and several multi-storey buildings being constructed at Mehrauli. He contended that in spite of repeated directions by the court, SDMC permitted illegal constructions to be carried out. While theSDMC said that demolition action had already taken place, the court observed that “further construction has nonetheless been carried out and some of the buildings were in the process of being occupied, as per the facts brought out in the plea.” It also noted that the court’s earlier observations on the illegal construction appear to have not been sufficient for SDMC to act. Last year, SDMC in its action taken report stated that it has undertaken a demolition action with respect to some structures in the area. The court had, however, said that the “isolated punctures in walls or roofs were insufficient” and if the structure was illegal, “it would have to be brought down”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/submit-status-report-on-illegal-constructions-near-qutub-hc/articleshow/84909460.cms||---

This came to fore during the standing committee meeting on Friday, when the project department proposal to increase the fund for widening of bridge on Maharajbagh DP road over tributary of Nag river came up for discussion. Though the department had already given the work to M/s Abrar Ahmed, it has now submitted the proposal to issue a work order. Since the beginning, the 800metre road widening work from Maharajbagh Square to University Library Square road had been in the news for all the wrong reasons. The work order, which was issued on September 9, 2015, is still not complete. The then estimated cost for the stretch was Rs4.74 crore and now it has escalated by almost four times. Despite this, standing panel headed by Prakash Bhoyar okayed the proposal and made financial provision of Rs2.77 crore for the completion of the bridge. The standing committee also okayed the civic chief’s proposal not to levy the annual 5% hike in water tariff. This is the first time in the last 11 years that the civic body has dropped the decision to hike water tariff ever since Orange City Water Private Limited took charge of the water supply in 2010-11. The move was taken in view of the financial crisis faced by citizens due to Covid-induced lockdown. Other proposals approved include public health engineering department to spend Rs40 lakh for hiring private operator to maintain pumps in public wells, hiring firm for maintenance of traffic signals and blinkers costing Rs1 crore per annum, shortlist firm for strengthening sewerage systems in Satranjipura and Ashi Nagar zones, and Rs91.99 lakh for repair of city roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-spent-rs2cr-without-standing-panel-nod/articleshow/84902498.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Delhi||GNCTD Act change violation of Constitution: AAP||NEW DELHI: Amid a heated discussion on the GNCT of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021 on the last day of the monsoon session of Delhi assembly, home minister Satyendar Jain on Friday said the amendment was in violation of the Constitution. AAP MLA Raghav Chadha claimed that the central government wanted to indirectly gain control of Delhi government. They both demanded that the amendment be withdrawn. Chadha said, “The amendment is not only against the Supreme Court’s 2018 judgment, but also the basic spirit of the Constitution. It amounts to the murder of the basic structure of the Constitution. The amendment was brought to reverse the SC judgment.” A discussion was initiated on “unconstitutional and unwarranted interference in the jurisdiction of the Delhi Legislative Assembly and its committees by the Union government”. Jain said by implementing the amended Act, the Centre was aspiring to bring back the viceroy culture of the British. “In the long run, it can act against the BJP government,” he added. “After BJP suffered in the Delhi elections in 2015 and 2020, they realised they could not run the government directly, so now they want to indirectly take over Delhi government. The amendment is an attack on federalism. It also murders the federal spirit that is at the core of the Constitution’s basic structure,” said Chadha, claiming that ever since AAP formed the government, BJP had been interfering into and obstructing their work. Slamming the central government, Chadha said the amendment mentioned that the power would be with the lieutenant governor in place of the elected government. “This means the elected government will not have any meaning. The amendment lays down that whatever rules Delhi assembly frames should be the same as Lok Sabha. If they are not in accordance with Lok Sabha rules, they will have no legal value,” he added. AAP MLAs Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj also slammed the Centre over the amendment. “The assembly committees are being attacked by the central government. They are not allowing these committees to investigate any more. It’s a matter of great regret and against the spirit of the House,” said Bharadwaj. Akhilesh Pati Tripathi, another AAP MLA, tore a copy of the amended Act in the House as a mark of protest. After Parliament’s approval, the amendment was notified earlier this year stating that the “government” in Delhi meant the “lieutenant governor”. BJP MLA Vijender Gupta said the AAP MLAs were misguiding on the amended Act. “The amendment does not curtail the powers of Delhi assembly. Instead, it ensures that the rules of Delhi assembly are consistent with Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha,” he added, further claiming that the department-related standing committees were used as a political tool by AAP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-gnctd-act-change-constitutional-violation/articleshow/84907512.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Delhi||Delhi: CISF bids adieu to 7 dogs with meals and medals||NEW DELHI: Goldy, Honey, Broni, Jack, Sandy, Cozy and Scoobie were familiar faces at Metro stations across Delhi over the past 10 years, roaming with their Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) handlers as they checked unidentified bags or possible improvised explosive devices (IEDs). On Friday, all seven of them were retired from the CISF dog squad after 10 years of service after being offered their favourite meals, medals, mementoes and certificates in a ceremony. All dogs inducted in the dog squad are provided a basic training of six months at CISF Dog Breeding Training Centre in Ghaziabad, with the dogs joining largely being puppies that are around six months old. They are taught to perform various essential tasks to keep Delhi Metro safe and secure from a number of possible threats. “This was a day to honour them for their service and efforts provided over the years. Each dog was given a special meal before they were given medals and mementoes. The achievements and efforts made by each dog were also read out loud,” said an official. CISF says the dog squad is utilised to sniff out possible IEDs or narcotics, with the bomb disposal squad often attending to an unattended bag with these sniffer dogs. “Only once the bag is cleared, it is inspected. In most cases, it is left behind by a commuter by mistake; however, there may be a threat too,” said the official, stating these dogs can also assist in quick reaction at Metro stations if required. “They are trained to run after an individual, too, if required. This can be done on command,” said the official. Jitender Rana, deputy inspector general at CISF’s DMRC unit, was the one who felicitated each dog with a medal and a memento, and also honoured their handlers. The dogs, after the ceremony, were handed over to the Friendicoes SECA animal shelter in Defence Colony. While Goldy, Honey, Broni and Jack are labradors, Sandy is a golden retriever. Cozy and Scoobie are German shephards. “Once they are handed over to Friendicoes, the process to get them adopted begins and the shelter works hard to find them a home in their last few years. Each dog is well-trained and affectionate,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cisf-bids-adieu-to-7-dogs-with-meals-and-medals/articleshow/84909487.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

This is the third time that the bridge, put up at several lakhs of rupees, has been washed away in the last one year, making the public complain that its a sheer waste of money and resources. Reconstruction of the 50-year-old Kuruvikkaran Salai bridge that connects the northern and southern banks of Vaigai river near Anna Nagar, was closed for traffic in May last year and later demolished to begin work on a new bridge a cost of Rs 23.17 crore. A temporary bridge was created on the western side of the original bridge for the movement of light vehicles. But, whenever there was a heavy flow of water in the Vaigai river, it disrupted traffic and caused much inconvenience to the public. Work on the new bridge was expected to be completed in March this year, but as it is prolonging, the dependency on the temporary bridge has only increased. In this backdrop, water flowing into the river from the Vaigai dam has washed away the bridge. People who use this road said that it was laid well before the Kuruvikkaran Salai bridge was demolished, but as proper channels, pipes were not laid at the bottom to enable water to flow freely, the bridge has been breaching whenever there was a heavy flow in the river. “I have to travel for 4km to come to the other side from Balarengapuram if not for this temporary bridge. But, the bridge is suddenly washed away and causing much inconvenience,” said T Thirupathy a construction worker. “Even if it is only a temporary bridge made of sand and gravel, the corporation has spent a few lakhs to lay this. Since its sub-standard, it becomes a recurring expenditure every few months, and a waste of public money,” say a commuter. Vijayakumar of Sandhaipettai said that the Madurai Corporation should expedite the work on the Kuruvikkaran Salai bridge and also lay the temporary bridge more sturdily till it is completed. Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan said that the civic body did not spend any special funds for the temporary bridge and the contractor had done it with his own resources. “The Kuruvikkaran Salai bridge is expected to be completed by the end of August this year, and then the temporary bridge would no longer be needed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/traffic-hit-as-vaigai-water-washes-away-bridge-again/articleshow/84905202.cms||---

He was interacting with reporters in Kanyakumari after inspecting the Thiruvalluvar statue and other tourist spots in the district on Friday.

---||Nagpur||Street for People announced sans nod from traffic cops, vending panel or shopkeepers||Nagpur: The Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited’s (NSSCDCL) move to declare a 300-metre patch of Sitabuldi main road as ‘no vehicle zone’ has come under the scanner. The city traffic police have not issued a notification regarding the ‘no vehicle zone’ rule on this road, which is mandatory as per law before declaring any such move. As part of Street for People initiative, NSSCDCL on Friday declared the stretch would be a ‘no vehicle zone’. The move was aimed at facilitating a hawkers’ zone. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, and NSSCDCL general manager (environment) Pranita Umredkar among others were present. Umredkar explained that Smart City will implement the Street for People initiative on an experimental basis for a fortnight on this stretch. As per plan, hawkers will be accommodated in the middle of the road and shoppers can move on either side. No hawker can occupy space in front of shops. Umredkar said Street for People has been launched on pilot basis and the main motive is to introduce walking friendly street market concept in the city. So, from Friday, NSSCDCL declared the 300-metre stretch (from Variety Square to Loha Pul) as no vehicle zone. However, it had not taken the permission of the Nagpur city traffic police. “We have not given any permission to declare the stretch as no vehicle zone,” confirmed DCP (traffic) Sarang Awad. Also, NSSCDCL claimed to have taken the consent of the town vending committee (TVC). However, a senior official from NMC’s market department confirmed that no TVC has been formed yet. Even Kaustav Chatterjee, who was a member of previous TVC, said the state government’s approval to the committee’s final proposal submitted by NMC is awaited for three years. “Thus, in absence of TVC, having discussion with few elected representatives of hawkers has no significance and will lead to more confusion,” he pointed out. Previous TVC, which had worked at ground level for three months, had identified hawking zones and even marked footpaths to notify the hawking area. But the committee was dissolved. There has been a continuous tussle between shop owners and hawkers on Sitabuldi main road. Thus, before taking any major decision, a systematic approach involving all stakeholders including shop owners is required. Office-bearer of Sitabuldi Merchants’ Association and shopkeeper Parag Thakkar said the move to make the area vehicle-free has shocked traders. “We weren’t informed or consulted about this decision. We condemn this move and don’t want this rule. Stopping entry of vehicles on the main road will kill our business,” he pointed out. The hawkers have already created a mess on the road. A lot of them are not even registered. Allowing them to sit in the middle of the road is actually making it a hawking street, and not a move that would go with the concept of Smart City, shopkeepers said. On the other hand, such proposals work when there is huge parking space, which is not the case on this stretch. There are around 3,000-4,000 two-wheelers of shopkeepers and their staff, and another 12,000-15,000 vehicles of customers. Traffic cops from Sitabuldi traffic zone too confirmed that no space has been earmarked for parking of shoppers’ vehicles anywhere in the vicinity. NSSCDCL has not sought deployment of additional traffic cops for implementing the new rule, they said. TOI spotted chaos on this stretch with hawkers encroaching the entire road during the day. Many were spotted violating Covid-19 guidelines like moving around without masks, not following social distancing norms etc. The attitude of planners appears to be biased towards hawkers. They took them in confidence but didn’t even consult shopkeepers. Before planning anything of this stature people in position should look at ground realities and talk to stakeholders, the shopkeepers said. In the past too, a similar move was announced but failed after shopkeepers from Sitabuldi main road approached the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/street-for-people-announced-sans-nod-from-traffic-cops-vending-panel-or-shopkeepers/articleshow/84902538.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Pune||Pune: Praise for CBSE students' efforts amidst pandemic||PUNE: Most schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in the city reported very good scores in the Class XII results announced on Friday, with more students than last year in the 90% club. Pronoy Kundu (99.8%) from the Army Public School Kirkee and Soham Joshi (99.2 %), a student of Bakliwal Tutorials preparing for the IIT entrance exam, were among the two students who scored above 99 % from Pune. This is the first time that the CBSE declared the results without conducting any examination based on the alternative marking scheme. Madhu Singh, Principal, Billabong High International School, said, “The CBSE results should not be considered as a result without an exam. It has been a historic year where the continuous performance of the child over three academic sessions have been considered. If this system is brought into the mainstream, it will keep our students more focused toward giving a continuous improved performance instead of waiting for one examination which will certify their credentials.” Singh also added that children were caught unawares about the current format to be adopted by the CBSE, so all those who took their grade XI examinations less seriously could have lost a few marks. The consistent performers need not to worry. Bharti Bhagwani, principal, GG International School, said, “Uncertainty will always exist, even after the pandemic has run its course. It’s up to us, whether we choose conquest or retreat. Conducting successive exams, incessant online sessions and constant counselling in the most pivotal academic moments in the lives of the students, ensuring an emotional connect was a leap of faith for everyone. Yet, the adaptation and ensuing transformation in the young GGIians was even more glorious.” Mrinalini Bhosale, principal, Vikhe Patil Memorial School, said, “No stone was left unturned to ensure that the teaching-learning process functioned smoothly. Students appeared for online exams throughout the year. At the end of the academic year, the students had physical pen and paper preliminary examinations. The final board practical examination was also conducted with every precaution in place and by following strict Covid-19 social distancing protocols.” Principal Bhavana Rai of Bharati Vidyapeeth English Medium School, Balewadi, said all the top five students were self-disciplined and dedicated towards their goal and brought laurels to the school. “They were not confined only to academics but also took equal interest in sports and co-curricular activities,” she said. Arti Sharma, principal, Army Public School, Kirkee, said, “Undeterred by the pandemic condition, students put in hours of painstaking effort and surpassed all odds to bring glory to their school and parents.” Damini Joshi, principal, Sanskriti School, said, “Students have proven themselves once again and performed very well in this unusual and unprecedented year. They adopted the new system wholeheartedly and worked exceptionally well against all odds. We are very proud of all our students who adapted themselves to the new norms beautifully and of their parents who supported them equally.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/praise-for-cbse-students-efforts-amidst-pandemic/articleshow/84907523.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The India Meteorological Department (IMD), Ranchi has issued a red alert for Saturday as a new well-marked low-pressure area has developed over southern UP which is likely to cause heavy to extremely heavy rainfall in northern and central parts of the state. “The well-marked low-pressure area originating over the Bay of Bengal laid near interior Gangetic plain which is most likely to move west-northwestward covering Bihar and then UP,” IMD Ranchi’s acting director Abhishek Anand said. On Friday, a six-year-old girl named Shruti Kumari in Pratappur block in Chatra district died after the wall of her mud house collapsed in the rain. Local police station in-charge Naeem Ansari said the deceased was cleaning utensils when the wall collapsed and she got buried in the debris. In Bokaro, a 70-year-old man died in his sleep when a tree fell over his kuccha house in Ladki Gola area under City police station. The deceased was identified as Bindeshwar Vishwakarma who worked at Shiv Timber. The district disaster management officer, Shakti Kumar, said he has sought a detailed report from the circle officers about the damage caused by the rain. Most parts of the state received light to moderate rainfall in the past 24 hours. Anand said that Latehar recorded maximum rainfall of 102 mm while many other weather stations recorded above 70mm rainfall. “Ranchi recorded 76mm rainfall during the last 24 hours,” he said. Several trains were regulated by the South Eastern Railway (SER) due to the inundation of the tracks and the Howrah yard. In an official statement, the SER said two trains – the Asansol-Tatanagar Special express, which was scheduled to leave from Asansol, and the Tatanagar-Asansol Special, scheduled to leave Tatanagar on Friday, were cancelled. In Ramgarh, the water level at Patratu dam crossed danger-mark due to continuous rains in upstream of Nalkari river that meets the Damodar river. A water level of RL1327ft is considered safe for Patratu and on Friday, the level breached 1328.5ft mark. The Patratu Thermal Power Station (PTPS) estate department has announced that one of the eight gates of the dam would be opened at 11:30pm on Friday to release the water.  PTPS’s estate officer Vishwanath Prasad said other gates might be opened if needed and they have already got the district administration’s approval in this regard.

ADG (operations) Sanjay Anand Lathkar, who is heading the SIT, IG Priya Dubey, DIG Mayur Patel Kanhaiyalal and Dhanbad SSP Sanjiv Kumar, along with other senior officials, visited the site where Anand was ‘murdered’ and conducted review meetings to discuss various aspects of the case. Lakhan Verma, the driver of the autorickshaw that dashed the judge from behind while he was jogging near the Randhir Verma Chowk -- a posh area in Dhanbad -- on Wednesday morning, and his accomplice Rahul Verma, who are both in police custody, were interrogated by senior police officials. When TOI asked ADG Lathkar over phone, he refused to say anything on the statements given by the accused auto driver, saying it would hamper the inquiry. “We are not taking the statement of the auto driver and his accomplice on face value and it has no significance when the police are conducting a detailed investigation into the case from different angles,” Lathkar said. Police are even looking into the complaint filed by the autorickshaw owner, Sugiya Devi, at Patherdih police station where she alleged that her auto was stolen on Monday. The locals, however, said that they saw five persons taking the auto to a nearby repair shop on Monday. Lathkar said they were conducting a scientific, technical and professional investigation in the case and they were trying to complete the investigation as soon as possible. When asked whether anything suspicious was found so far, the ADG said he would not like to comment on this till the completion of the inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/addl-judge-death-sit-visits-murder-site-in-dhanbad/articleshow/84907314.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The package tour, which has been christened ‘Dakshin Bharat Yatra’, will be held between September 21 and 29, IRCTC officials here said on Friday. IRCTC said the train will commence its journey from Asansol railway station in West Bengal and will make stops at Ranchi, Bokaro Steel City, Tatanagar stations in Jharkhand. It will reach Renigunta railway station in Andhra Pradesh, where passengers will be able to pay a visit to the Tirupati temple. The train will then make a stop at Rameshwaram, Madurai and Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu before rolling into Kochuveli station in Kerala. In Kochuveli, pilgrims can pay a visit to the Padmanabhaswamy temple before beginning their return journey. One passenger will be charged Rs 10,395, IRCTC officials said. Yuvraj Minz, the area manager of IRCTC in Ranchi, said the train will have two isolation coaches for the passengers if they develop symptoms of Covid-19 during the journey. In all, the train will have room for 700 passengers. “All passengers will have to compulsorily produce their Covid-19 vaccination certificates before embarking on the journey. Passengers will be allowed only if they have taken both their doses,” IRCTC’s chief supervisor Jyoti Kumari said.

The Garhwa officials have also been directed to send the 19 samples for genome sequencing as the presence of Delta variant of the virus has been detected in MP. State epidemiologist Dr Praveen Karn said, “We are awaiting the report from the district while we have directed the district officials to preserve the samples of the 19 patients for genome sequencing.” Upon contact, Garhwa deputy commissioner Rajesh Kumar Pathak said that medical as well as administrative teams have gone to the village and they are in the process of earmarking containment zones there. “As soon as we got to know about the 19 infections, we sent our medical team there for contact tracing,” he added. All the 19 patients, belonging to three families, have been admitted to the Covid care centre in Garhwa and their condition is said to be stable. Asked if any kids, out of the 19 patients, tested positive, district epidemiologist Dr Santosh Kumar Mishra said, “Eight out the of 19 patients are below 18 years.” Dr Mishra added, “Two migrant workers, both aged 25, had arrived at Garhwa railway station from Sagar district in Madhya Pradesh on July 25. As per protocols, we had collected their swab samples at the station itself and they tested positive on July 26. Soon after we received the reports, we tracked down the two and admitted them to the hospital.” He said, “On Wednesday, we started contact tracing in the village and collected 25 samples, of which 19 tested positive. Till now, we have collected over 200 samples from the Haradag Khurd village for testing.” Local sources in Garhwa claimed that the migrant workers didn’t follow the protocols and they were not in home isolation after their return to the village, which led to the infection spread. The migrants had given wrong contact numbers to the district health department officials which made it difficult for the department to contact them and thereby, delayed the process of contact tracing and isolation by 24 hours. “We had received the test reports of the two workers on Monday but we couldn’t track them until Tuesday as they had given wrong phone numbers,” a health department official from Garhwa said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/19-test-ve-in-garhwa-village-after-migrants-arrival-from-mp/articleshow/84907182.cms||Gaurav Pandey

---||Surat||Surat: Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology student bags Rs 40 lakh package||SURAT: Amid the desperation of the pandemic, Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) has many reasons to cheer. A girl student of its electronics and communication engineering department, Sweety Jain, has broken the records of highest salary in campus placements by bagging a Rs 40 lakh salary per annum offer from a software giant. The second highest salary to be offered is Rs 37.5 lakh by a software giant to another student, Pritesh Tripathi, from computer engineering branch. Over 52 percent students out of the eligible were selected in SVNIT’s campus placement even as global business and industries are adversely affected by Covid-19. Like in 2020, this year too the entire placement process for the varsity was conducted online. Daughter of a sweet shop owner from Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan, Sweety is the only person from her family who has been offered a handsome starting package. “Majority of my family members are in business. I am probably the only one to get such a good starting salary,” she said. In 2020, out of 1,056 eligible students of Bachelor of Technology (B Tech), Master of Technology (M Tech) and Master of Science (M Sc), total 666 students were recruited. Whereas, this year 539 out of total 1,029 eligible students, had got placements. “Last year around 60 percent students were recruited in campus placement while this year 52 percent students were recruited. A troubling condition were feared due to continuation of the global pandemic in second year; however, it is better and the situation is improving,” said Dr R A Christian, in-charge campus and placement. Pritesh, who is from Ananthapur in Andhra Pradesh, is happy with the overall good placements in SVNIT. “Students were not expecting a good campus placement this year but the overall recruitments are good. We hope that the situation improves further,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/svnit-student-bags-rs-40l-package/articleshow/84905562.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The entire exercise costs a student around Rs 3.5 lakh, which is eight times higher than the normal airfare from Ahmedabad to Toronto. The number of students going to Canada this year is higher as Australia has closed its border. Those who had taken admission in varsities in Down Under are bidding time in anticipation. According to tour operators, the students are currently preferring to go to Male, the capital of Maldives, in order to be quarantined for 14 days and from there to UAE before reaching Canada. Sanjay Mehta, a Rajkot-based tour operator said, “At present only Etihad Airways and Emirates Airlines are operating flights to Canada. These airlines don’t allow any person who have stayed in India in the last 14 days to board.” And so, students have to to go to Male and be under quarantine there for 14 days after which they go to Doha or Abu Dhabi to catch a flight for Toronto, he said. The flights to Male from India are also taking advantage of this situation. According to Mehta, these flights ask the students to book return tickets too, as well as take two doses of Covishield specifically. The airfare from Male to Toronto via Middle east was around Rs 80,000 earlier, but has now shot up to Rs 2 lakh. A student has to spend around Rs 1.25 lakh for staying in Male, and then pay Rs 2 lakh air fare to reach their destination. Australia has closed its borders for outsiders thus making it difficult for Indian students to go there. Because of this, many students took admissions in Canadian universities this year. Students who had already secured admission in Australian universities are studying online. Monil Mehta, who deals in student visas, said, “This year the rush to Canada is very high as Australian borders are closed. This has also resulted in refusal of around 20,000 Canada visas too as universities there don’t have available seats as compared to the number of application they had received. Those who got visas are hit by travel problems.” Manit Chovatiya, a student from Rajkot got admission in business management in an Australian university last year. He can’t wait to reach the campus. “I am waiting for air service to start from India,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/canada-study-dreams-get-dearer-for-indian-students/articleshow/84905788.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Ranchi||BJP leaders target govt over illegal mining issue||Dumka: Former ministers in the erstwhile Raghubar Das government on Friday criticized the incumbent mahagathbandhan government for failing to curb illegal mining in the Santhal Pargana. They even went on allege that illegal miners have tacit backing of the ruling dispensation. Former agriculture minister Randhir Kumar Singh, former social welfare minister Lois Marandi and former tourism minister Amar Kumar Bauri attended the inaugural day of the BJP’s five-day Satyagraha that got underway at Dumka’s Phulo Jhano Chowk on Friday morning. “The Hemant Soren-led government is misusing the administrative machinery, including the police, to suppress the voices of dissent within the ranks of the mahagathbandhan itself,” Singh said at the meeting. He added: “The chief minister is himself patronizing illegal mining. Illegal mining is causing losses worth Rs 100 crore to the state exchequer everyday.” “The CM’s political representative in his assembly constituency, Pankaj Mishra, has been playing pseudo chief minister in Santhal Pargana. The CM’s own constituency (Barhait) is devoid of development projects,” Singh, the sitting BJP MP from Sarath, said. Singh also demanded that Soren should step down from his office for failing to keep his promise of generating 5 lakh jobs a year for the state’s youth. Marandi said that the JMM, which claims to be the saviour of jal, jangal and jamin (water, forests and land), was itself engaged in exploiting Jharkhand’s natural resources. “The officials have turned a blind eye towards rampant illegal mining after succumbing to the pressure of the CM and his younger brother (Dumka MLA Basant Soren),” Marandi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-leaders-target-govt-over-illegal-mining-issue/articleshow/84907500.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A senior official said that the earlier fine was “very nominal” and it has now been decided to impose heavier fines. The proposed fines, however, are neither listed in the Bill nor the cabinet note. Goa currently has six offshore casinos and dozens of onshore casinos. The Bill amends sections 3, 4 and 11 of the Act which deal with fines and imprisonment. “The quantum of fine payable under the penal provisions of sections 3, 4 and 11, being meagre, needs enhancement. And on account of the same, the offences punishable under the said sections will be either imprisonment or fine or both.” The law was enacted in 1976 when Goa was part of the Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu. With the passing of the bill the state government can omit the expression ‘Daman and Diu’ and ‘Union Territory’ in the Act. Goa was conferred statehood on May 30, 1987 and Daman and Diu was made a separate Union territory. The state law department then noted that the expressions ‘Daman and Diu’ and ‘Union territory’ need to be removed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/violating-gambling-act-will-attract-heavier-fines/articleshow/84907836.cms||---
---||Goa||Oppn walks out over govt’s ‘haste’ to pass 11 bills minus discussion||Porvorim: The final hours of the three-day monsoon assembly session witnessed chaotic scenes as opposition MLAs walked to the well of the house protesting the more than 11 bills taken up for passing. The protesting legislators later staged a walk out, as the speaker did not accept their demand to refer the bills to a select committee for scrutiny. Condemning the government for the haste, they said the bill copies were given to the MLAs at 4am on Friday. They said the very purpose of discussing bills before passing them was defeated. Congress, Goa Forward Party and Nationalist Congress Party MLAs said that they “did not want to be accomplices in the fasttrack sale of Goa” by the BJP government led by CM Pramod Sawant. The MLAs, including leader of opposition Digambar Kamat, first began their protest as soon as the afternoon session began at 2.30pm. They told the speaker that there was insufficient time to discuss the bills, as a curtailed session of three days has been scheduled despite opposition protests. Kamat said there was no need to pass crucial bills pertaining to mining and panchayat raj in such a haste. But speaker Rajesh Patnekar continued with the proceedings. Discussion on only one private member resolution could take place, and then opposition MLAs began their protests again and first walked to the well of the House. MLAs Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar and Rohan Khaunte began singing a Marathi song critical of Sawant. Patnekar adjourned the House for 15 minutes in view of the situation. But when proceedings resumed, the MLAs walked into the well once again. As they shouted and sang in protest, Patnekar decided to carry on with the proceedings. Demand for grants pertaining to a number of departments were passed amidst the chaos. When Patnekar then took up the process of passing the bills, the opposition MLAs staged a walk out. “On three occasions, we asked the speaker that the bills should be referred to the select committee... Such crucial bills cannot be passed in a haste without discussion,” said the leader of opposition. Kamat said that when BAC was told that 11 bills would be brought, how could the government bring 22 bills? The last day of the monsoon session ended earlier in the evening. The first day’s business had concluded at 1.08 am and the second day’s at around 4.30 am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oppn-walks-out-over-govts-haste-to-pass-11-bills-minus-discussion/articleshow/84907889.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Haryana to set up state administrative tribunal in Panchkula instead of Karnal||CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government will soon start its state administrative tribunal (SAT) in Panchkula for redressal of employee grievances related to service matters. The state government had earlier proposed to set up the SAT in Karnal after which advocates practicing at the Punjab and Haryana high court had gone on a long strike. Highly placed sources confirmed to TOI that the state government would now set up the SAT in Panchkula instead. A formal announcement in this regard is expected to be made soon by the BJP-JJP coalition government. A committee headed by the Haryana chief secretary to resolve the issue that had cropped up after strong objection of the HC lawyers is learnt to have suggested that it was feasible to set up the SAT in Panchkula. Confirming the development, Haryana advocate general Baldev Raj Mahajan said that the state would soon have an administrative tribunal in Panchkula in which all the disputes related to grievances of government employees would be heard. When asked about the objection of the high court lawyers, Mahajan said the grouse of the lawyers was against the setting up of a tribunal in Karnal. “As I am also a part of the lawyers’ fraternity, it was also my duty to protect their interests. I don’t think there would be any problem for the lawyers now as Panchkula is easily accessible to them,” Mahajan added. The tribunal would function on the lines of the central administrative tribunal (CAT), which hears service-related disputes of central government employees. Importantly, a retired judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court was appointed in 2019 as the chairperson of the Haryana SAT. However, the tribunal has not functioned for the last almost two years because the HC had deferred the implementation of the Centre’s notification on setting up of the Haryana tribunal. The central government had issued a notification dated July 24, 2019, under Section 4(2) of the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985, constituting the Haryana Administrative Tribunal for the service matters pertaining to the state government employees. This led to an unprecedented situation where the members of the Punjab and Haryana high court bar went on strike against the issuance of the notification and the functioning of the court was paralysed for more than three weeks in July-August 2019. On August 2, 2019, the full bench of the HC had deferred the implementation of the central government’s notification. The Haryana government on August 13, 2019, constituted a committee headed by the state chief secretary after the lawyers’ body sent a representation to the chief minister. The committee had to give its findings about the legality, viability and workability of the state administrative tribunal. The committee recently completed its meetings, and the Haryana chief secretary has prepared a final report after hearing all the parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-to-set-up-state-administrative-tribunal-in-panchkula-instead-of-karnal/articleshow/84909624.cms||Ajay Sura

Shivam found a rope, tied a noose around his neck and played the part. But his feet slipped off the stool he was propping himself up on. He died within minutes. It was Thursday afternoon, at Babat village in UP’s Budaun. Shivam was home with his younger brother and sister, and his parents were out working on their paddy fields. He home to play with the kids in his village. Independence Day was approaching. “They decided to put on a play for the occasion,” Shivam’s uncle Vinod Kumar said. It would be one on Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, executed by the British colonial administration for killing British police official John Saunders. When the execution scene had to be enacted, Shivam looked for a rope. The swing would do, he thought, and brought a stool to climb on. He took the swing’s rope, fashioned a noose out of it and put it round his neck. But at some point, his feet went off the stool. He struggled to breathe, as his friends thought he was just acting. In February last year, a 12-year-old boy from Mandsaur in MP had also been accidentally hanged when he was trying to re-enact the execution scene from a school play.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/boy-9-dies-rehearsing-bhagat-singh-hanging/articleshow/84911342.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Cabral also asked cabinet members to give suggestions on the draft policy for electrical vehicles, which has been uploaded on the website, before it is sent to the finance department. As per the policy, electric two-wheelers will be cheaper than the petrol/diesel ones. The smart bill will be generated every month on a particular day. Replying at the demands, Cabral said during the pandemic the issuing of electricity bills was delayed as meter readers had to visit every house. He clarified that while bills may be given after one month, it is generated every month. Cabral assured the members of the House of improving the power infrastructure in the state. Presently, 35% of Goa has underground cabling and that once the existing work is completed 60% of the cables will be underground, the power minister said, adding that the balance will be taken up subsequently. He also said that the state government will change 11,000 agriculture five-star rated pumps free of cost starting from August 15. Cabral said that it has been decided to give 90% subsidy for purchasing a pump in areas where there is not grid connectivity. Speaking on environment demands, Cabral said that the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) refused to prepare the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan which is why the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) was approached.

Sawant on Wednesday, while informing the House about the progress made in investigation of the Benaulim gangrape case, had said, “When 14-year-olds stay on the beach the whole night, the parents need to introspect. Just because children don’t listen, we cannot put the responsibility on the government and police.” After being criticised widely, he claimed he was quoted out of context. Sardesai, however, said security and safety is the sole responsibility of police. “Let’s suppose I’m shot on the road. It can’t be said that I should not have gone there because it was not safe,” he said. Alleging that there has been a complete breakdown of the law and order in the state, Sardesai asked if Sawant was even aware that after the Benualim gangrape incident, there were two more, one in Usgao and the other in Quepem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oppn-dons-black-armbands-insists-safety-is-duty-of-police/articleshow/84908849.cms||---
---||Chennai||School fees to be 75%-85%, no student to be stopped from classes: Madras HC||CHENNAI: In a reprieve to private unaided schools in the state, including CBSE institutions, the Madras high court has permitted them to collect 85% of the annual fee fixed for the academic year 2019-20 as annual fee for the current academic year. This applies only to students of parents who are employees of government, public sector undertakings, professionals and business people who have not suffered any income loss due to the pandemic, Justice D Krishnakumar said. “Those parents who have suffered loss of income during this pandemic shall make an application to the school management, who shall consider their request and collect 75% fee,” the court said. The court made it clear that such fees must be collected in six instalments on or before February1, 2022. If any parents seek further concession for payment of annual fees, on account of unemployment or close down of business due to lockdown, they shall approach school management, who shall consider such representation on a case-to-case basis sympathetically, the judge added. The management shall not debar any student from attending online or physical classes for non-payment of fees and shall not withhold the results of the examinations, the court said, adding if any such action is brought to the notice of the authorities, suitable action shall be taken against the institutions concerned. This apart, Justice Krishnakumar said it is the responsibility of the jurisdictional educational authorities to ensure that no student is dropped out. “If any difficulty is faced by the students to continue in a particular school, they can approach the jurisdictional educational authorities, who shall make necessary arrangements to accommodate such students in a nearby government school,” the court said. The court has directed the government to consider sanctioning fees for any unfilled seats under the RTE Act in such private institutions in which students who could not pay fee can be accommodated. The court passed the orders on a batch of pleas moved by private schools and their associations seeking to permit them to collect the full fee fixed by the fee fixation panel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/school-fees-to-be-75-85-no-student-to-be-stopped-from-classes-madras-hc/articleshow/84911475.cms||Suresh Kumar

The Rs 1,300 crore Project Lion recommends setting up of eight satellite habitats for the king of the jungle apart from the Gir sanctuary in its native Saurashtra itself. The project has received preliminary approval of the Union ministry for forest and environment and has been sent for final nod of the union cabinet, top sources said. Satellite habitats for lions have been proposed in Umath Virdi in Bhavnagar, Gir, Girnar, Mitiyala, Jesor-Hipawadi, Babra Virdi, Hingolgadh, the coastal belt from Rajula to Jafrabad and extending up to Mahuva among others, senior state forest department officials said. Ironically, the current version of Project Lion rolled into motion is in sharp contrast with project lion draft prepared by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII). ‘Gujarat has been averse to shifting lions to Kuno Palpur’The WII had recommended shifting Asiatic lions outside Saurashtra to sanctuaries in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and north Gujarat. The Project Lion draft prepared by WII had recommended shifting of a few lions to seven sanctuaries namely Madhav National Park, Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary, and Kuno Palpur in Madhya Pradesh; Sitamata Wildlife Sanctuary, Mukundara Hills Tiger Reserve and Kumbalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary in Rajasthan and Jessore-Balaram Ambaji Wildlife Sanctuary in Banaskantha, Gujarat. This proposal, however, was rejected by the Union ministry of forest and environment. “Gujarat is loath to translocate any lions outside the state. This is the major reason behind rejection of the WII proposal which recommended shifting a small population of lions to half a dozen sanctuaries in neighboring states and one in Gujarat,” said a WII member and lion expert. “State’s possessiveness over lions is not healthy as moving Big Cats was proposed to safeguard lion population from getting wiped off by any deadly virus outbreaks in the future," the member said. It needs mention that Gujarat has been averse to shifting lions to Kuno Palpur sanctuary as ordered by the Supreme Court in 2010 too. In 2015 Lion Census had counted 523 lions in the state which grew to 674 as per recent official estimates in June 2020. In 2018, 29 lions had succumbed to Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) outbreak in Gir sanctuary and neighbouring areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/eight-new-satellite-habitats-for-lions-planned-in-gujarat/articleshow/84911472.cms||---

Officials said the poacher, identified as Motilal Keja Salame (55), a resident of Bichwasahni village, 15km from Pandhurna in Madhya Pradesh, has confessed to having killed the tiger three years ago. Saoner JMFC has remanded Salame in forest custody (FCR) till August 3. Over 10 days ago, assistant conservator of forest (ACF) Narendra Chandewar had got information about Salame planning a deal. Deputy conservator of forest (DyCF) Bharat Singh Hada formed a team of RFOs and others under Chandewar. They reached the poacher’s hideout from where the tiger skin and body parts were seized. The ACF said that they lured Salame in a trap and nabbed him from his village farm where he had hidden the skin and paws on late Thursday night. “It was a joint effort by our staff,” said Chandewar. According to sources, the accused was changing spots to mislead the intermediator and forest team. The deal was finalized at Saoner on Thursday night but Salame took the intermediator to his village near Pandhurna where the material was hidden. It is learnt, Salame has told officials that the tiger had killed a cow in the forest near his village three years ago. To take revenge, the cattle carcass was poisoned and after consuming it the tiger died. Salame removed the skin and chopped the paws. Recently, Salame, on the direction of his Chhindwara-based relative, was looking for prospective buyers to dispose of the skin and paws. The relative is also likely to be arrested soon. “We have intimated our MP counterparts about the case,” said Chandewar. The forest officials have also seized the cell phone of the accused and booked him under various sections under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. ACF Surendra Kale is investigating further links in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/poacher-nabbed-with-tiger-skin-and-four-chopped-paws/articleshow/84901615.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The Bill also seeks to amend Section 7 of the Goa Panchayat Raj Act, to hold the election procedure in a free and fair manner by handing over the election process, including reservations, to the Goa State Election Commission as mandated under the 73rd Constitutional Amendment. Speaking on the passage of the Bill, panchayats minister Mauvin Godinho said that 50 to 60% houses don’t have house tax numbers. Godinho said that illegal houses have been constructed in villages and panchayats are not earning any revenue, and hence there was a demand from panchayats to do something about it. “People have welcomed the move to introduce this Bill,” he said. The amendment to the Goa Panchayat Raj Act also seeks to introduce a provision wherein a person can replace a tiled roof with concrete slab. This will be allowed for single-dwelling units that existed prior to the enactment of the 1994 Act, subject to production of stability certificateby a registered structural engineer. “The Bill is in the interest of the common man living in villages,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/60-homes-dont-have-house-tax-number-mauvin/articleshow/84907821.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
