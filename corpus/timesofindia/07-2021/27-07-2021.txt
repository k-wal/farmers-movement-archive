En route they planted saplings too. The duo started the journey on June 30 and completed it on July 9. Guruprasad says, “We decided to uplift the spirit of many people who have lost their hope since the outbreak of the pandemic, so we decided to pedal 1,000 kilometers and selected Tirupati as a final destination because we wanted to reach people who live in villages, to spread awareness about the need to stay safe to fight against the deadly pandemic. On our way, we requested people to indulge in physical activities for at least one hour a day. We were holding the banner at several places to convey a message to people about safety protocol they need to follow. ” The duo planted saplings in 13 different locations in the vicinity of colleges, schools and police stations. “We wanted people to look after the saplings, so through our NGO Helping Hands, we got in touch with locals and ensured they cared for the saplings,” says Bharath. On what they learnt from this journey in the pandemic, they say, “We have done a lot of long distance cycling. This is the first time we did it for a cause, so it was an ultimate satisfaction when our journey culminated at Tirupati. Despite COVID, the reception we get from people at stopover points is overwhelming, which we will cherish for a lifetime.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/a-duo-from-mysuru-cycle-1000-kilometers-to-spread-covid-19-awareness/articleshow/84750280.cms||Vinay Lokesh

---||Business||Aon, Willis halt $30 billion merger over monopoly concerns, delay||NEW DELHI: Aon Plc and Willis Towers Watson Plc on Monday called off a $30 billion merger that would have created the world's largest insurance broker, saying US regulators' objections created unacceptable delay and uncertainty. The decision, hailed by some as an early victory for the Biden administration's Department of Justice, which sued last month to block it, stood at odds with European regulators who recently approved the deal on condition the companies sell assets. Those now-halted sales largely affect broker Arthur J Gallagher & Co. Combining Aon and Willis, which rank second and third in revenue behind Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc, would have created a new leader with $20.3 billion in annual revenue, compared with $17.2 billion for Marsh. Aon will pay Willis a $1 billion termination fee, the timing and financial impact of which was not immediately clear. Aon reports second-quarter results on Friday. Willis said on Monday it would boost share repurchases by $1 billion. "Despite regulatory momentum around the world ... we reached an impasse with the U.S. Department of Justice," Aon Chief Executive Greg Case said in a statement. US Attorney General Merrick Garland called the termination "a victory" because employers "rely on insurance brokers like Aon and Willis Towers Watson for managing the complexities of these health and retirement benefits," he said. Aon declined to comment. Willis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Aon's shares were up 9.6% at $254.72, while Willis Towers' stock fell 9% to $205.93 in New York trading. Timing issues Though the DOJ argued the combination would broadly reduce competition and lead to higher prices, US District Judge Reggie Walton last week narrowed the trial scope to two issues: whether large US companies would be worse off when buying property, casualty and financial risk coverage; and health-and-benefit coverage for employees. Walton, who has been assigned criminal cases related to the January 6 US Capitol attack, warned that those could be heard before the Aon-Willis-DOJ suit, which risked further delaying the deal's approval. "Since some of (the defendants) are incarcerated, their rights to a speedy trial are going to have to take precedent," Walton said at a July 6 hearing. A lengthy court process of possibly nine months would push the deal's closure well into 2022, and that posed too much risk, according to a person familiar with the matter. Solving the remaining DOJ issues also posed a threat to customers and employees because the businesses are not organized by client size, making selling parts difficult, the source said. "If we had tried to separate out large clients, we would have broken up books of business," the source said, referring to portfolios of policies. This would raise concerns about whether account executives would need to leave Aon with the policies that were sold, or would remain with Aon but lose customers. "The companies were not able to come to an agreement with the DOJ that made economic sense for them," said Piper Sandler analyst Paul Newsome. "I don't think it's more complicated than that." Broader implications The DOJ had also alleged the combination would reduce competition in reinsurance broking, retirement and pension planning and private retiree multi-carrier healthcare exchanges. But the sides had begun finalizing settlement on those issues. In a video to Aon employees, Case said: "The DOJ position is remarkably out of step with the rest of the global regulatory community and we were confident that we would win in court." The halted divestitures included Aon's U.S. retirement unit, US retiree healthcare exchange and its retirement business in Germany, along with Willis's global reinsurance business. Aon also said it had extended by three years the employment contracts of Case and Chief Financial Officer Christa Davies, through April 1, 2026, to provide stability. Some saw the DOJ's victory as a sign of a new tone in Washington. "I applaud Attorney General Garland for his commitment to addressing America's monopoly problem by stopping consolidation and aggressively enforcing the antitrust laws," David Cicilline, chair of the House antitrust subcommittee, said in a statement. Broader implications were felt by companies in the midst of large deals that could also attract the DOJ's antitrust gaze. Discovery Inc pared gains to 1.9% after jumping 10% in early trading. The media firm announced in May a $43 billion combination with AT&T Inc's WarnerMedia. Kansas City Southern dipped 1.2%. The railroad operator agreed to be acquired by Canadian National Railway , although the Biden administration has shipping costs in the sector in its anticompetitive sights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/aon-willis-halt-30-billion-merger-over-monopoly-concerns-delay/articleshow/84772404.cms||---

---||World||Tunisia president sacks defence minister amid political turmoil||TUNIS: Tunisian President Kais Saied sacked the defence minister on Monday, a day after ousting the prime minister and suspending parliament, plunging the young democracy into constitutional crisis in the midst of a pandemic. Street clashes erupted Monday outside the army-barricaded parliament, after Saied dismissed Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi and ordered parliament closed for 30 days, a move the biggest political party Ennahdha decried as a "coup". Saied declared on Sunday he had "taken the necessary decisions to save Tunisia, the state and the Tunisian people," following street protests in multiple cities against the government's handling of the Covid pandemic in the North African country. The president, who under the constitution controls the armed forces, warned his opponents against taking up arms, threatening that if anyone "fires a single bullet, our forces will respond with a rain of bullets". On Monday afternoon, the presidency announced the dismissals of Defence Minister Ibrahim Bartaji and Hasna Ben Slimane, the acting justice minister. Soldiers from early Monday blockaded the assembly in Tunis while Saied backers hurled stones, bottles and insults at supporters of the Islamist-inspired Ennahdha, whose leader was barred entry to the complex. Troops also surrounded the office of Mechichi, who was yet to officially react to the events. Later in the afternoon, the protests died down, with the presidency ordering an overnight curfew. Saied's dramatic move (a decade on from Tunisia's 2011 revolution, often held up as the Arab Spring's sole success story) comes even though the constitution enshrines a parliamentary democracy. It "is a coup d'etat against the revolution and against the constitution," said Ennahdha, the leading party in Tunisia's fractious ruling coalition, warning its members "will defend the revolution". The United States on Monday voiced alarm and called on the birthplace of the Arab Spring to adhere to "democratic principles", while the European Union appealed to people to respect the "rule of law" and to "avoid any resort to violence". France urged a speedy return to "normal functioning" of the government, Russia said it was monitoring the situation, while Turkey, where the government supports Ennahdha, called for "democratic legitimacy" to be restored. The crisis follows months of deadlock between the president, the premier and Ennahdha chief Rached Ghannouchi, which has crippled the Covid response, as deaths have surged to one of the world's highest per capita rates. More than 18,000 people have died of coronavirus in a nation of 12 million. Police also shuttered the local bureau of Qatari-based Al Jazeera television, the network's Tunis director Lotfi Hajji said, warning that "what is happening is very dangerous, it is proof that freedom of the press is threatened". Rights group Amnesty International and media organisation Reporters Without Borders both condemned the move. The powerful Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT) which played a key role in the 2011 uprising, said the president acted "in accordance" with the constitution to "prevent imminent danger and to restore the normal functioning" of the state. Saied's power-grab sparked jubilant rallies late Sunday by supporters who flooded the streets of Tunis, waving the national flag and sounding their car horns as fireworks lit up the sky. Since Saied was elected in 2019, he has been locked in a showdown with Mechichi and Ghannouchi, who is also house speaker. The rivalry has blocked ministerial appointments and diverted resources from tackling Tunisia's many economic and social problems. Among chaotic scenes outside parliament Monday, Ghannouchi admonished an army officer who was blocking access and who had declared the troops were "the protectors of the nation". Ghannouchi retorted that "the Tunisian people will never accept an authoritarian government, whatever your efforts". Saied said he would assume executive power "with the help" of a government whose new chief he would appoint himself. In the 10 years since Tunisia's popular revolution toppled dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia has had nine governments. Some have lasted just months, hindering the reforms needed to revamp the country's struggling economy and poor public services. Sunday's drama began with mass protests against the government for its failures in tackling the pandemic. A senior Ennahdha official, speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity, alleged that the protests and subsequent celebrations were choreographed by Saied. After Saied's announcement, one jubilant supporter, Nahla, hailed the president's "courageous decisions". "This is the president we love!" she said, but one man in his forties looked on without enthusiasm. "These fools are celebrating the birth of a new dictator," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/tunisia-president-sacks-defence-minister-amid-political-turmoil/articleshow/84773065.cms||---
---||World||Biden, Kadhimi seal agreement to end US combat mission in Iraq||WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden and Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi on Monday sealed an agreement formally ending the US combat mission in Iraq by the end of 2021, more than 18 years after US troops were sent to the country. Coupled with Biden's withdrawal of the last American forces in Afghanistan by the end of August, the Democratic president is completing US combat missions in the two wars that then-President George W. Bush began under his watch. Biden and Kadhimi met in the Oval Office for their first face-to-face talks as part of a strategic dialogue between the United States and Iraq. "Our role in Iraq will be ... to be available, to continue to train, to assist, to help and to deal with ISIS as it arises but we’re not going to be, by the end of the year, in a combat zone," Biden told reporters as he and Kadhimi met.  There are currently 2,500 US troops in Iraq focusing on countering the remnants of Islamic State. The US role in Iraq will shift entirely to training and advising the Iraqi military to defend itself. The shift is not expected to have a major impact since the United States has already moved toward focusing on training Iraqi forces. A US-led coalition invaded Iraq in March 2003 based on charges that then-Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government possessed weapons of mass destruction. Saddam was ousted from power, but such weapons were never found. In recent years the US mission was dominated by helping defeat Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. "Nobody is going to declare mission accomplished. The goal is the enduring defeat of ISIS," a senior administration official told reporters ahead of Kadhimi's visit. The reference was reminiscent of the large "Mission Accomplished" banner on the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier above where Bush gave a speech declaring major combat operations over in Iraq on May 1, 2003. "If you look to where we were, where we had Apache helicopters in combat, when we had U.S. special forces doing regular operations, it's a significant evolution. So by the end of the year we think we'll be in a good place to really formally move into an advisory and capacity-building role," the official said. U.S. diplomats and troops in Iraq and Syria were targeted in three rocket and drone attacks earlier this month. Analysts believed the attacks were part of a campaign by Iranian-backed militias. The senior administration official would not say how many US troops would remain on the ground in Iraq for advising and training. Kadhimi is seen as friendly to the United States and has tried to check the power of Iran-aligned militias. But his government condemned a U.S. air raid against Iran-aligned fighters along its border with Syria in late June, calling it a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. The US.-Iraqi statement is expected to detail a number of non-military agreements related to health, energy and other matters. The United States plans to provide Iraq with 500,000 doses of the Pfizer or BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine under the global Covax vaccine-sharing program. Biden said the doses should arrive in a couple of weeks. The United States will also provide $5.2 million to help fund a UN mission to monitor October elections in Iraq. "We're looking forward to seeing an election in October," said Biden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-kadhimi-seal-agreement-to-end-us-combat-mission-in-iraq/articleshow/84773147.cms||---

Both are rated at 100 lpm (litre per minute) capacity,” deputy commissioner Shrikant Balasaheb Suse told TOI. Diskit is 113 kms north of Leh and 11 kms from the Army’s Siachen Brigade headquarters. The area has villages on the border with POK on its western flank. Nyoma is 180 km east of Leh and forms the supply roadhead to villages in the Chushul and Indus sectors along the eastern part of LAC. Suse recently inspected the healthcare infrastructure in forward villages to take stock of their Covid preparedness. The administration is also weighing the option of setting up plants at Tangtse, the Chushul brigade headquarters and Khaltse, some 90 kms south of Leh. The new plants will ensure continued oxygen supply even in winter when road connectivity, especially with Nubra and Tangtse, become vulnerable to heavy snow and avalanches on the high passes – Khardung La and Chang La, respectively. Strict monitoring and medical planning by the district administration had averted oxygen shortage in Leh even though cases spurted during the second wave. The Ladakh administration had started work on augmenting oxygen supply right after the first wave had ebbed. Leh and Kargil has one oxygen plant each in the government sector. Leh has two more plants in the private sector. One plant for Zanskar sub-division of Kargil district wass also under consideration, divisional commissioner Saugat Biswas had recently told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/leh-boosts-oxygen-infra-in-forward-areas/articleshow/84773767.cms||Sanjay Dutta

It was the latest disaster in the Mediterranean Sea involving migrants seeking a better life in Europe. The vessel left the western coastal town of Khums on Sunday, Safa Msehli, a spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration, said. She said there were at least 75 migrants on board, including women and children. Among the 57 presumed drowned were 20 women and two children, Msehli said. Eighteen of the migrants were rescued and returned to shore by fishermen and Libya's coast guard, Msehli said. The survivors, who are from Nigeria, Ghana and Gambia, reported the vessel had stopped due to an engine problem, then capsized amid bad weather, Msehli said. Monday's capsizing was the second sea disaster in less than a week off the Libyan coast involving Europe-bound migrants. At least 20 migrants went overboard from a vessel on Wednesday and were presumed dead, according to the UN migration agency. There has been a spike in crossings and attempted crossings from Libya in recent months. Amnesty International has said that in the first six months of this year, more than 7,000 people intercepted at sea were forcibly returned to detention camps in Libya. A migration agency report earlier this month said the number of migrants and refugees who died while attempting to reach Europe on dangerous sea crossings more than doubled so far this year, compared to the first six months of 2020. The report said at least 1,146 people perished between January and June, with the Central Mediterranean route between Libya and Italy being the deadliest, claiming 741 lives. The deadliest shipwreck so far this year took place April 22 off Libya, when 130 people drowned despite the ship sending multiple distress calls. Libya has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. The oil-rich country plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime autocrat Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Rights groups and officials at UN agencies that work with migrants and refugees have for years cited survivor testimony about systematic abuse in detention camps in Libya. These include forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture. The abuse often accompanies efforts to extort money from families before migrants are allowed to leave Libya on traffickers' boats. Earlier this month, Libyan maritime authorities acknowledged that one of their coast guard vessels had fired warning shots at a migrant boat it was chasing in the Mediterranean. They said it was an apparent effort to stop the vessel from crossing to Europe and endangering the lives of the migrants onboard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/migrant-boat-capsizes-off-libya-57-thought-dead-un/articleshow/84773686.cms||---

We are discussing reducing the syllabus this year too. We will make an announcement soon,” school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi said on Monday. Recently, CBSE had retained a 30% syllabus cut for Class IX to XII for 2021-22 in view of continuation of online classes. Last year, the state school education department had made up to 40% syllabus optional for board exam students. “We cannot ask the students to prepare a full syllabus for the board exam in seven months. Students are learning online and the school reopening date is not known,” the minister said after inaugurating a programme for basic computer functional training for government school teachers. Computer basics training will be given to 432 resource persons from Monday to Friday. More than 2.1 lakh teachers will be given training in batches in basics of computer and internet to conduct online classes in Zoom and Google Meet. The minister said the learning deficit due to remote learning is a worrying factor. "Kalvi TV should not be the only medium of instruction. We are developing apps and preparing video lessons. So, we are equipping our teachers to conduct lessons and assessment online,” Poyyamozhi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-mulls-cutting-down-syllabus-for-state-board/articleshow/84773683.cms||---
---||Chennai||Veteran actor Jayanthi passes away||CHENNAI: Veteran actor Jayanthi, who had acted in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi and Malayalam movies died in her sleep on Monday, said the family members. She was 76. Her son Krishna Kumar confirmed that she had been recovering from prolonged illnesses but finally lost the battle. Belonging to the K Balachander school of acting, she played key roles in such classics as ‘Bama Vijayam’, ‘Ethir Neechal’, ‘Punnagai’, and ‘Velli Vizha’. As a character artist, her roles in ‘Sengottai’, ‘Manidhan’, ‘Gopala Gopala’, ‘Housefull’, and ‘Pudhalvan’ among others won acclaim. She played a range of characters — from a naive village damsel to a brash princess brought down to earth by the hero — in more than 500 films in various languages. Born in 1945 in Ballari and called Kamalakumari till she assumed the screen name Jayanthi, she was groomed as a classical dancer by her mother Santhanalakshmi with active encouragement by father Balasubramanyam. She has the distinction of being paired with Kannada thespian Rajkumar in 45 films and he’d recall that she was the first to address him as Raj. After making her debut in ‘Jenugoodu’ (1965), she appeared with him in ‘Chandavalliya Thota’ in her second film. Many of her female leads with Rajkumar acquired the status of cult classics. The cameo as Onake Obavva in the Puttanna Kanagal-directed ‘Nagarahavu’ showed her prowess at acting. Her portrayal of a sex-deprived wife of an impotent husband in ‘Edakallu Giddada Mele’ was acclaimed by viewers and critics alike. She was open to experimenting with unconventional characters, playing a commercial sex worker in Kanagal’s last film ‘Masanada Hoovu’. Her marvellous acting earned her the moniker Abhinaya Sharade and six state awards and a Filmfare award. In her personal life, she stoically bore pain and bitterness. After separating from her first husband Peketi Shivaram, a director, she married Rajashekhar and made a film for him in the mid-1980s. She even dabbled in politics, unsuccessfully contesting the Lok Sabha polls from Chikkaballapura on a JD(S) ticket in 2004.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/veteran-actor-jayanthi-passes-away/articleshow/84774671.cms||---
---||World||As January 6 probe begins, Democrat vows: 'We have to get it right'||WASHINGTON: The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Bennie Thompson, didn't realize the severity of the Jan. 6 insurrection until his wife called him.  He was inside the Capitol, sitting in the upper gallery of the House, hoping for what he called a "bird's-eye view of the process" and to be able to tell his grandchildren that he was there when Congress certified Joe Biden's presidential victory.  People are breaking into the building, London Thompson told him, and it was on television. "I'm watching people climbing over the wall right now," she said.  "It doesn't register," the Mississippi Democrat recalled in an interview with The Associated Press. "I said, 'You can't break in. There's police and barricades and a lot of things out there.'"  But it was not long before the House chamber was under siege. Police rushed Thompson and several dozen other members of Congress to another side of the gallery and told them to duck under their seats as supporters of then-President Donald Trump tried to break down the doors to the chamber below.  "It was a horrible day," said Thompson, "still almost surreal that it even occurred."  Like Thompson, many who serve and work in the Capitol are trying to make sense of the chaos that unfolded on Jan. 6. And he now has a guiding role in the process, appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as the chairman of a select committee that will investigate the attack. The panel will hold its first hearing Tuesday with police officers who battled the rioters.  As the longtime chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Thompson is accustomed to dealing with grave matters of national security. But his stewardship of the Jan. 6 panel will be a test unlike any other, as he tries to untangle the events of a violent insurrection that many House Republicans increasingly play down and deny.  "We have to get it right," Thompson said. If the committee can find ways to prevent anything like it from happening again, "then I would have made what I think is the most valuable contribution to this great democracy."  Thompson, 73, is a liberal fixture in Congress and longtime champion of civil rights, the only Democrat in the Mississippi delegation, hailing from a majority-black district in the state's western half. He has avoided the limelight during his more than 15 years on the Homeland Security Committee, notching achievements with careful bipartisan outreach.  Several Democrats and Republicans said Thompson was the right choice to lead an investigation that is certain to be partisan and fraught.  "I've dealt with Bennie for 15 years, and we disagreed on a lot, but I don't think there was ever a harsh word between us," says former Republican Rep. Pete King of New York, who was the chairman and top Republican on the Homeland Security Committee for years opposite Thompson. "Bennie is low key, he manages his side well. He was a good guy to work with. He was strong and knew what he wanted, but there was very little drama."  New York Rep. John Katko, who is now the top Republican on the Homeland Security Committee, gave a similar assessment. Thompson is "a good man, a patriotic American" and a "productive partner," Katko said in statement.  Pelosi chose Thompson as chairman after he crafted legislation with Katko that would have created an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6 attack. That bill won almost three dozen Republican votes in the House only to flame out in the Senate, where the opposition of Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell was decisive.  Far fewer House Republicans supported creating the House select committee, dismissing the effort as partisan. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said the GOP won't participate after Pelosi rejected two of his appointments, Republican Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana and Jim Jordan of Ohio.  Only two Republicans voted to create the panel - Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger. Pelosi first appointed Cheney to the committee and then added Kinzinger on Sunday after McCarthy withdrew his picks.  "I'm looking forward. in the long run, to try to have as many of the 13 members that I can," Thompson said last week.  House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who was appointed to the Jan. 6 committee, said Thompson's history of working with Republicans and his popularity among members will make it harder to malign the panel's work. Reaching the bipartisan deal with Katko was not an easy task, he said.  "I think he has a very even keel that will help him get through this," Schiff said.  Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, another Democrat appointed to the select committee, says both parties have "partisan brawlers" - and Thompson is not one of them.  "He's a workhorse, so he likes getting stuff done," Raskin said. "And I think that's the right spirit for this."  Still, Thompson has taken sharply partisan stances. He joined with about 30 Democrats in a 2005 vote to invalidate President George W. Bush's victory - not unlike the dozens of Republicans who voted to invalidate Biden's in January. In that challenge, the dissenting Democrats claimed irregularities if not fraud in Ohio's vote.  The effort did not end in violence and John Kerry, the defeated Democratic presidential candidate, did not lead or join the effort to deny Bush his victory.  A frequent critic of Trump, Thompson joined other Democrats in filing a lawsuit against the former president after the insurrection, charging that he incited the attack and conspired to prevent Congress from certifying Biden's victory.  Last week, Thompson withdrew his participation in that lawsuit, which he joined soon after the Senate acquitted Trump, at his second impeachment trial, of inciting the insurrection. Thompson's withdrawal petition said he "wishes to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest between his role on the Select Committee and his role as a Plaintiff in this litigation."  The lawsuit, which is still active, names as defendants Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, and the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. The Justice Department has filed charges against members of those groups in connection to the attack, and the panel is expected to investigate them as part of its probe.  Domestic extremism and its links to white supremacy are a familiar subject for Thompson not only from his time on the Homeland Security Committee but also from his early involvement in the civil rights movement in Mississippi. He was active with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in college and organized voter registration drives before he was elected mayor of his small hometown of Bolton.  The FBI's assessments about the growing dangers of domestic extremism, he said, show that "the significance of this committee's work is as important as it can ever get."  ___  Associated Press video producer Padmananda Rama contributed to this report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/as-january-6-probe-begins-democrat-vows-we-have-to-get-it-right/articleshow/84774929.cms||---
---||World||Death from 1985 shaken baby case leads to murder charge||FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA: Babysitter Terry McKirchy got a light sentence 36 years ago after pleading no contest to attempted murder for shaking 5-month-old Benjamin Dowling so severely that he suffered permanent brain damage - weekends in jail for three months and three years probation. But now McKirchy is facing a possible life sentence after a Florida medical examiner says Dowling succumbed to those injuries when he died in 2019 at the age of 35 after a life with severe mental and physical disabilities. A Broward County grand jury recently indicted McKirchy, 59, with first-degree murder and she is now jailed near her home in Sugar Land, Texas, pending her return to Florida. McKirchy, who has previously denied injuring the boy, has waived extradition, the Broward state attorney's office said. The South Florida SunSentinel first reported the arrest. "The passage of time between the injuries sustained and the death of the victim were considered by the forensic experts who conducted the autopsy and ruled the death was directly caused by the injuries from 1984," prosecutors said in a statement. "This case was presented to the grand jury, which determined that this was a homicide.'' It is not known whether McKirchy has an attorney and the Broward public defender's office, which represented her in the 1980s, did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment. McKirchy told The Miami Herald in 1985 she was innocent, but accepted the plea deal to put the case behind her. Under the deal, she would only serve weekends until her third child was born and then she would be free. Terry McKirchy pleaded no contest in 1985 to attempted murder for shaking 5-month-old Benjamin Dowling so severely that he suffered permanent brain damage. (AP)"I know I didn't do it. My conscience is clear. But I can't deal with it anymore,'' McKirchy told the paper then. "I'm six months pregnant. You wouldn't believe what this has done to my family.'' Rae and Joe Dowling, Benjamin's parents, said their first son never progressed after his injuries, depending on his family and others. "Benjamin never crawled, fully rolled over, walked, never talked, never fed himself, he never enjoyed a hamburger or an ice cream cone, he could never tell us when he had an itch or anything hurt,'' the couple said in a statement. "When he cried in pain, we as a family and caregivers had to guess as to what was wrong and hope that we could satisfy his need." They did not address McKirchy's arrest in their statement and, through the state attorney's office, declined interview requests. The Dowlings had been married four years when Benjamin was born Jan. 13, 1984. Both Dowlings worked, so they hired McKirchy, then 22, to babysit him at her suburban Fort Lauderdale home. Rae Dowling says when she picked up Benjamin from McKirchy on July 3, 1984, she instantly knew something was wrong. His fists were clenched and his body limp. She rushed him to the hospital, where doctors said he had suffered a brain hemorrhage from severe shaking. McKirchy was charged with attempted murder and aggravated child abuse. The Dowlings told the Herald in 1985 they were stunned when prosecutor Barbara Mitchell told them of the plea deal McKirchy would receive. She had been facing 12 to 17 years. Mitchell told the paper then the sentence was "therapeutic,'' but did not explain. Mitchell is still with the Broward prosecutor's office, but was not made available for comment. Another prosecutor is handling the current case. Ryal Gaudiosi, then McKirchy's public defender, called the sentence "fair under the circumstances.'' He died in 2009. David Weinstein, a Miami defense lawyer and former prosecutor who is not involved in the case, said it is difficult to know what went into the 1985 deal. Perhaps witnesses were not available or the available medical evidence was not strong. Prosecutors may have felt McKirchy's pregnancy would make it difficult to get a conviction. Today, he said, prosecutors may think a homicide case is stronger because perhaps the medical and scientific evidence has progressed. He said McKirchy's attorneys may argue that the time lapse will make it impossible for them to mount an adequate defense as witnesses may have died and memories faded. "There are a lot of unanswered questions,'' he said. The Dowlings said Benjamin endured several surgeries in his life, including having metal rods placed along his spine. He got nourishment through a feeding tube and attended rehab and special schools. The Dowlings had two more children and would take Benjamin to their games and performances. The family moved to Florida's Gulf Coast in the late 1990s. He died at their home on Sept. 16, 2019. "Benjamin would never know how much he was loved and could never tell others of his love for them," they said. "Benjamin did smile when he was around his family, although he could never verbalize anything, we believe he knew who we were and that we were working hard to help him.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/death-from-1985-shaken-baby-case-leads-to-murder-charge/articleshow/84774417.cms||---
---||World||Peru's new first family leaving behind rural, Andean home||CHUGUR: The humble two-story, adobe home of the Castillo family, located in one of the poorest districts of Peru deep in the Andes, feels a little empty now. Lilia Paredes packed up the family's belongings within the last week, neatly folding her husband's shirts and picking some plates and silverware in between visits from farmers from nearby villages stopping by to say goodbye. A neo-baroque presidential palace awaits Paredes, her husband and Peruvian President-elect Pedro Castillo, and their two children, should the family choose to live in the historic building. Castillo, will be sworn in as president on Wednesday, less than two weeks after he was declared the winner of the June 6 runoff election. The leftist rural teacher, who has never held office, defeated his opponent, right-wing career politician Keiko Fujimori, by just 44,000 votes. Paredes is not sure where she, her husband and two children will live starting Wednesday. She also does not know where the children will go to school once classes begin. "We don't have any property in Lima,'' she told The Associated Press last week on her foggy patio in Chugur while she rubbed her hands amid the cold of the Andean winter. "We are people from the countryside, and almost always, the provincial have to wait years to have a property in the capital. If they tell me to live in another place, it would also be the same, we are not kings to live in a palace, we go to work.'' Castillo's supporters included the poor and rural citizens of the South American nation. He popularized the phrase "No more poor in a rich country,'' and stunned millions of Peruvians and observers by advancing to the runoff. The economy of Peru, the world's second-largest copper producer, has been crushed by the coronavirus pandemic, increasing the poverty level to almost one-third of the population and eliminating the gains of a decade. The typical presidential transition process was derailed after Fujimori tried to overturn the result, asking election authorities to annul thousands of votes alleging fraud, an accusation she could never prove. That left the Castillo family little time to make plans and say their goodbyes. Unlike all of Peru's former presidents of the last 40 years, the Castillos have no home in Lima. Paredes, also a teacher, said she and her husband have to decide whether they will live in the presidential residence, but it is likely they will call it home. She has seen it from the outside but has never stepped inside, not even on guided tours that were offered during pre-pandemic times. Choosing their home is a significant decision given Castillo's anti-elite rhetoric. His campaign slogan could be called into question if the family moves into the ornate presidential palace. Paredes is taking to Lima some bags with food, including peas, beans, sweet corn flour and cheese that the family makes at home after milking their cows at dawn. The family's house, which Castillo built more than 20 years ago, will be in the care of Paredes' elder sister. The family has also packed study materials for Arnold, 16, and Alondra, 9. Paredes would like her children to attend a university and a state college. She said Arnold wants to study civil engineering because he likes math. "Alondrita will continue studying in a public school, but I would like it to be one of nuns,'' Paredes said. If that happens, it will be the first time in decades that the children of a president enroll in public education. The powerful in Peru have long preferred private schools. Some local media outlets had suggested that Paredes would wear an haute couture dress from a Lima-based designer, but she categorically denied that option. She chose Lupe de la Cruz, a seamstress from a town near Chugur, to make two suits for her. "I like simple, My husband likes what I wear, and I like what he wears,'' she said. Paredes recently brought de la Cruz two cuts of brown and green wool fabric. The seamstress showed her a fashion magazine, and the next first lady chose the designs of two discreet suits. "She does not like embellishments nor scandalous colors,'' de la Cruz said days later at her workshop, cluttered with fabrics, scissors, needles, threads and rulers. Before leaving for Lima, Paredes and her family attended a service in the Nazarene church that is located a few yards from their home. Pastor Victor Cieza invited dozens of pastors from other evangelical churches from the surrounding villages. The church with yellow walls and a tin roof filled up with neighbors dressed in hats and woolen ponchos like those worn by Castillo. Some sang accompanied by a guitar; others reflected on vanity and the importance of humility. "Everyone knows us, we will never forget where we are from and where we have to return because the positions are not forever,'' Paredes said at the end of the service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/perus-new-first-family-leaving-behind-rural-andean-home/articleshow/84775102.cms||---

Vaccine protection remains very strong against severe infections and hospitalisations caused by any version of the virus, and those most at risk are still the unvaccinated, according to leading Covid-19 experts. The major worry about the Delta variant is not that it makes people sicker, but that it spreads far more easily from person to person, increasing infections and hospitalisations among the unvaccinated. Evidence is also mounting that it is capable of infecting fully vaccinated people at a greater rate than previous versions, and concerns have been raised that they may even spread the virus, these experts said. “The biggest risk to the world at the moment is simply Delta,” said microbiologist Sharon Peacock. Until there is more data on its transmission, experts say masks, social distancing and other measures set aside in countries with broad vaccination campaigns may again be needed. Public Health England said that of those hospitalised in Britain with the Delta variant, 58.3% were unvaccinated and 22.8% were fully vaccinated. In Singapore, where Delta is the most common variant, 75% of its cases occurred among vaccinated individuals. Israeli officials said 60% of current hospitalised cases were in vaccinated people. In the US, the Delta variant represents about 83% of new infections. So far, unvaccinated people represent nearly 97% of severe cases. The Pfizer vaccine, one of the most effective against Covid-19 so far, appeared only 41% effective at halting symptomatic infections in Israel over the past month as the Delta variant spread. A study in China found that people infected with the Delta variant carry 1,000 times more virus in their noses compared with the ancestral Wuhan strain. “You may actually excrete more virus and that’s why it’s more transmissible. That’s still being investigated,” Peacock said. “It’s outcompeting all other viruses because it just spreads so much more efficiently,” said virologist Shane Crotty. Genomics expert Eric Topolnoted that Delta infections have a shorter incubation period and a far higher amount of viral particles. “That’s why the vaccines are going to be challenged. The people who are vaccinated have got to be especially careful. This is a tough one,” Topol said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/covid-19-delta-infecting-even-fully-vaccinated-at-a-greater-rate/articleshow/84773989.cms||---

So though he single-handedly managed to form a BJP government in the south for the firstHowever, there was an issue of perception as to why Yediyurappa was continuing despite being 78 years of age. Several leaders, including Kalraj Mishra, Najma Hepatulla, had to quit the Union ministry once they attained 75 years of age. Although he took over in 2019 at the age of 76, the party had no option with Yediyurappa being the tallest leader of the Lingayats, the largest community in the state, whose support played the most important role in making BJP the single- largest party in the 2018 assembly polls. As Yediyurappa continues to hold the grip on the Lingayat community, the party brass will keep him in good humour and is likely to assign his younger son Vijayendra some key responsibility in the state. A known Yediyurappa loyalist, Shobha Karndlaje (Chikamagaluru-Udupi) was recently given a berth in the Union council of ministers, as the move was seen as precursor to the Lingayat veteran’s exit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/with-b-s-yediyurappa-on-board-bjp-confident-of-smooth-transition-in-karnataka/articleshow/84775395.cms||Akhilesh Singh
---||World||Bosnian Serb politicians decry outlawing of genocide denial||SARAJEVO: Bosnian Serb political representatives have pledged to block decision-making in the country's institutions in protest over a recent move by the top international envoy in Bosnia to outlaw genocide denial. "We will not live in a country where someone can impose a law by simply publishing it on his website,'' Milorad Dodik, the Serb member of Bosnia's joint presidency, said on Monday. Dodik spoke after a meeting of leaders of all Bosnian Serb political parties to discuss the imposition on Friday by UN High Representative to Bosnia Valentin Inzko of changes to the country's criminal code. The imposed changes introduce prison sentences of up to five years for genocide denial and the glorification of war criminals. Dodik repeatedly said over the weekend that Inzko's decision should serve as a final push for secession of Bosnian Serb lands from the rest of the country. In a decision published after their meeting on Monday, Bosnian Serb political representatives said they considered Inzko's decision "unacceptable and void,'' announcing they will confront it by boycotting the work of the country's multi-ethnic presidency, parliament and government. Under the terms of the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement that ended Bosnia's 1992-95 interethnic war, the country was carved into highly autonomous Serb-run Republika Srpska and a federation shared by Bosniaks and Croats. The two are linked by joint institutions and all the decisions on the state level have to be reached by consensus of the three ethnic groups. As the top international envoy overseeing implementation of the peace agreement, the High Representative was given the authority to impose laws or dismiss officials who undermine the post-war ethnic balance and reconciliation efforts. In the immediate post-war years, the international community kept Bosnia on a reform course, pressuring its leaders to accept painful compromises in return for financial and other support. But over a decade ago, as the international focus shifted to other global crises, Bosnia was mostly left to its own devices. This has encouraged Bosnian Serb leaders, Dodik in particular, to increasingly call into question the country's continued existence and stoke ethnic tensions by downplaying or denying the crimes committed by their ethnic kin during the war. They have been denying with particular gusto the scope of the 1995 massacre in Srebrenica, Europe's only acknowledged genocide since World War II. The International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court for Former Yugoslavia declared the Bosnian Serb killings of more than 8,000 Bosniaks that took place in Srebrenica in July 1995 as genocide. But Bosnian Serb officials and neighboring Serbia have refused to accept the designation. Bosnian Serbs also have honored their wartime leader, Radovan Karadzic, and military commander Ratko Mladic as heroes, although both have been convicted of genocide and sentenced to life imprisonment by a Hague-based tribunal. Murals featuring Mladic and Karadzic can be seen in many towns in the Serb-run part of Bosnia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/bosnian-serb-politicians-decry-outlawing-of-genocide-denial/articleshow/84775509.cms||---
---||World||Veterans Affairs requires COVID-19 vaccination for health care workers||WASHINGTON: The Department of Veterans Affairs on Monday became the first major federal agency to require health care workers to get Covid-19 vaccines, as the aggressive delta variant spreads across the nation and some communities report troubling increases in hospitalizations among unvaccinated people. The VA’s move came on a day when nearly 60 leading medical and health care organizations issued a call for health care facilities to require their workers to get vaccinated. “With more than 300 million doses administered in the United States and nearly 4 billion doses administered worldwide, we know the vaccines are safe and highly effective at preventing severe illness and death from Covid-19,” Dr. Susan Bailey, immediate past president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement. “Increased vaccinations among health care personnel will not only reduce the spread of Covid-19 but also reduce the harmful toll this virus is taking within the health care workforce and those we are striving to serve.” Although vaccination among physicians is nearly universal — 96% according to an AMA survey — that’s not the case for many other people working at health care facilities. In nursing homes, only about 60% of staffers are vaccinated, compared with about 80% of residents, according to recent numbers from Medicare. And Covid-19 cases are rising. At the VA, vaccines will now be mandatory for certain medical personnel — including physicians, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, registered nurses, physician assistants and others who work in departmental facilities or provide direct care to veterans, said VA Secretary Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough. Employees will have eight weeks to get vaccinated. “It’s the best way to keep veterans safe, especially as the delta variant spreads across the country,” McDonough said in a statement. “Whenever a veteran or VA employee sets foot in a VA facility, they deserve to know that we have done everything in our power to protect them from Covid-19. “With this mandate, we can once again make — and keep — that fundamental promise,” he added. In addition to the AMA, the medical and health care groups calling for mandatory vaccines for health workers included the American Academy of Nursing, the American Public Health Association, the American Pharmacists Association and, for the first time, a nursing home industry group. LeadingAge, which represents nonprofit nursing homes and elder care facilities, had previously advocated educating nursing home employees about the benefits of getting their shots. Also joining the call was the National Medical Association, the leading professional group representing Black physicians. “Unfortunately, many health care and long-term care personnel remain unvaccinated,” the groups said in a statement. “We stand with the growing number of experts and institutions that support the requirement for universal vaccination of health workers.” It was unclear what would happen to VA employees who refuse to be vaccinated. The longstanding policy in the health care industry is for staff to stay up-to-date with vaccinations, such as annual flu shots. However, a general rule is to allow exceptions for medical reasons, such as known allergies. One complicating factor with the Covid-19 vaccines is that they have yet to win full approval from the Food and Drug Administration, and continue to be provided under emergency use authorization. The lack of a full approval has fed into hesitancy among some people. However, the emergency approval process didn’t skip the extensive testing required of any vaccine. Of the three manufacturers of vaccines approved in the U.S., Pfizer and Moderna have applied for full approval, and a Pfizer decision is expected soon. And the COVID-19 vaccines were not brewed overnight, either. Indeed, they were the fruit of more than 10 years of behind-the-scenes research and huge injections of funding that laid the groundwork for them to be rolled out so quickly. Katie Smith Sloan, CEO of LeadingAge, said it’s time go beyond the power of persuasion. “As Covid-19 variants emerge and proliferate, we can start saving more lives today by ensuring staff are fully vaccinated,” she said. nated,'' she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/veterans-affairs-requires-covid-19-vaccination-for-health-care-workers/articleshow/84775713.cms||---

Four other people were also killed in the shootout.  Three people inside the home - believed to be the gunman's sons and their mother - were fatally shot during the standoff Sunday afternoon in Wasco, a small community in the middle of farm fields northwest of Bakersfield. Deputies shot and killed the suspect after he climbed onto the home's roof with the firearms.  Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood identified the slain deputy as Phillip Campas and called him "a star in our organization."  Campas, 35, was a five-year veteran of the sheriff's office and had previously served as a sergeant in the US Marines in Afghanistan. He was an instructor at the academy, as well as a member of the sheriff's SWAT team and the honor guard.  Campas is survived by his wife and two young children.  "We thought he'd been here over 10 years, he's had that kind of impact," Youngblood said. "He was here for five."  Deputy Dizander Guerrero was wounded by gunfire and two deputies were struck by shrapnel during the violence.  The violence began around 1 p.m., and included a 911 call that had an open line into the home, Youngblood said. The activity heard on the call led deputies to believe at least one person was still alive inside the home.  "We felt obligated to go in and try and rescue that victim," the sheriff said.  Two women and two girls were able to escape the home safely, Youngblood said. Their relationship to the shooter and the other victims was not immediately clear.  The 41-year-old suspect has not yet been named publicly but Youngblood said there was a restraining order filed against him that prohibited him from having firearms as of June 3. The sheriff did not know what prompted the restraining order.  The shooting "has the implications of what we see in law enforcement when it comes to domestic violence and how serious it is," Youngblood said, "and, quite frankly, how a restraining order is not bulletproof."  The victims inside the home - only described as the gunman's 17- and 24-year-old sons and their 42-year-old mother - also have not been named publicly.  The first deputies to arrive at the home, following multiple 911 calls, were met by a woman who said there was a gunman inside the house and two to three people had been shot.  Within minutes, Youngblood said, the gunman started firing at the deputies from inside the house. A SWAT team, including Campas and Guerrero, approached the front door and encountered gunfire from a rifle. The deputies fired back at the shooter.  Campas and Guerrero were struck and pulled to a safe location so they could be rushed to the hospital. The two deputies who were hit by shrapnel did not leave the standoff, the sheriff said.  Over several hours, the suspect fired out of the house at the deputies. Around 6:30 p.m., the gunman climbed onto the roof with the rifle and handgun. Deputies fired at him, fatally striking him.  Authorities found the other three victims dead inside the home.  More than 100 deputies responded to the scene and 23 - some on the SWAT team and others who were close with Campas - are currently on administrative leave because of the shootings.  The SWAT team members were off-duty and not responding to calls on Monday as they grieved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/5-die-including-deputy-in-shootings-at-california-home/articleshow/84776222.cms||---

The Harris County sheriff's office said that deputies arriving at the soccer park Sunday morning found a 29-year-old man shot to death and his 38-year-old girlfriend wounded. Sgt. Ben Beall of the Harris County sheriff's office said that the woman was taken to a hospital, where she and her unborn child were pronounced dead.  The sheriff's office said witnesses told investigators that the woman's 42-year-old ex-husband had been watching one of their sons play soccer when he saw his ex-wife and her boyfriend in the parking lot, walked up to them and shot them both multiple times with a revolver.  Authorities say the ex-husband then walked to his vehicle and drove away.  About two hours later, officials responding to a call about a possible suicide found a man believed to be the ex-husband dead from an apparent gunshot wound behind a home, the sheriff's office said.  The names of the victims and suspect have not been released, pending confirmation by the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/man-fatally-shoots-ex-wife-man-at-houston-soccer-field/articleshow/84776412.cms||---

Protesters gathered at the House of Terror Museum in the capital, Budapest, which commemorates victims of Nazism and Communism, and marched to the headquarters of the governing Fidesz party. Criticising Prime Minister Viktor Orban, some chanted: "Victator." "This (allegations of illegal surveillance) was the last straw for me," said one protester, Marcell Csupor. "This reminds me of communist systems, and shows that the country is breaking away from the West and drifting towards the East." The government, which is at odds with many other European Union member states over rule-of-law and democracy issues, has not commented on the allegations beyond saying Hungary's intelligence-gathering is conducted lawfully. A report by a group of 17 international media organisations and Amnesty International this month said the Pegasus spyware, made and licensed by Israeli company NSO, was used in hacking and attempts to hack smartphones belonging to journalists, human rights activists and government officials in several countries. Direkt36, the Hungarian partner in the group of media outlets, said those targeted for surveillance included journalists, businessmen, lawyers and people critical of the Hungarian government. Hungarian prosecutors have launched an investigation into multiple complaints received since the reports. NSO has said its product was intended only for use by vetted government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to fight terrorism and crime. In Hungary, which was ruled by communists for four decades after World War II, the minister of justice approves surveillance in matters of national security. Miklos Hajnal, a member of the opposition Momentum party which organised the protest, called the Pegasus case the biggest scandal in Hungary since the transition to democracy in 1990. "This is not acceptable in a country where people know how the socialist regime used to work," he said. "There is a reason for the existence of security services, but it cannot simply be to cling to power."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/hungarians-protest-against-alleged-illegal-surveillance-with-pegasus-spyware/articleshow/84776163.cms||---

Heading into a make-or-break week, serious roadblocks remain. Disputes have surfaced over how much money should go to public transit and water projects. And other disagreements over spending and wage requirements for highways, broadband and other areas remain unresolved, as well as whether to take unspent Covid-19 relief money to help pay for the infrastructure. Biden, asked about the outlook, told reporters at the White House he remained optimistic about reaching a compromise. Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that Biden himself ``worked the phones all weekend,'' and that the administration was encouraged by the progress. But Psaki acknowledged that ``time is not endless,`` as the White House works with the Senate to finish the package. This week is crucial after more than a month-long slog of negotiations since Biden and the bipartisan group first celebrated the contours of the nearly $1 trillion bipartisan agreement in June. The White House wants a bipartisan agreement for this first phase, before Democrats go it alone to tackle broader priorities in a bigger $3.5 trillion budget plan that's on deck. A recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC found 8 in 10 Americans favor some increased infrastructure spending, and the current package could be a political win for all sides as lawmakers try to show voters that Washington can work. But as talks drag on, anxious Democrats, who have slim control of the House and Senate, face a timeline to act on what would be some of the most substantial legislation in years. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer warned senators they could be kept in session this weekend to finish the work. He wants progress on both packages before the August recess. Adding to the mix, Donald Trump issued a statement Monday disparaging Senate Republicans for even dealing with the Democrats on infrastructure, though it's unclear what influence he has. The former president had failed at an infrastructure deal when he was in office. ``It's time for everyone to get to `yes,''' Schumer said as he opened the Senate. Schumer said Trump is ``rooting for our entire political system to fail'' while Democrats are ``rooting for a deal.'' The bipartisan package includes about $600 billion in new spending on public works projects, the first phase of Biden's big infrastructure proposals. The Democrats and the White House had sent what they called a ``global'' offer to Republicans on remaining issues late Sunday, according to a Democratic aide close to the talks and granted anonymity to discuss them. But Republicans rebuffed the ideas, according to a GOP aide also granted anonymity to discuss the private talks. The new proposal attempted to reopen issues that had already been resolved, the Republican aide said, suggesting the White House will need to show more flexibility. While much of the disagreement has been over the size of spending on each category, labor issues have also emerged as a flashpoint. Democrats are insisting on a prevailing-wage requirement, not just for existing public works programs but also for new ones, according to another Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private talks. Those include jobs for new broadband and cybersecurity programs, for school buses and ferries, and a new infrastructure financing authority that would develop roads, bridges, electric vehicle charging stations and other projects, the aide said. At the same time, transit funding has been a stubborn disagreement throughout the past several days of talks. The bipartisan group originally appeared to be moving toward agreement on more money for transit. But Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, the top Republican on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which oversees public transit, raised questions. He cited, in part, previous Covid-19 federal relief money that had already been allocated to public transit. Three rounds totaling nearly $70 billion in federal Covid-19 emergency assistance over the past year pulled transit agencies from the brink of financial collapse as riders steered clear of crowded spaces on subway cars and buses. ``Nobody's talking about cutting transit,'' Toomey said Sunday. ``The question is, how many tens of billions of dollars on top of the huge increase that they have already gotten is sufficient? And that's where there is a little disagreement.'' Typically, spending from the federal Highway Trust Fund has followed a formula of 80% for highways and 20% for transit. Democrats and public transit advocates see expanded public transit systems as key to easing traffic congestion, combating climate change and curbing car pollution. In the latest offer, Democrats said they would accept the Republican proposal on highway spending, contingent on Republicans agreeing to the Democratic position on public transit, the Democratic aide said. Psaki has previously said transit funding ``is obviously extremely important to the president _ the `Amtrak President,' as we may call him.'' The senators also appeared to be debating public water works funding. The group had an agreement to add $15 billion to deal with lead pipe contamination beyond funds already approved in a Senate water bill. But it's unclear if that agreement is holding after Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, raised questions. The final package would need the support of 60 senators in the evenly split 50-50 Senate to advance past a filibuster _ meaning at least 10 Republicans along with every Democratic member. Last week's test vote failed along party lines as Republicans sought more time to negotiate. There are other remaining issues still unresolved around how to pay for the bipartisan package. The group is seeking a compromise after Democrats rejected a plan to bring in funds by hiking the gas tax drivers pay at the pump and Republicans dashed a plan to boost the IRS to go after tax scofflaws. Meanwhile, Democrats are readying the broader $3.5 trillion package, which would go beyond public works to include child care centers and family tax breaks, paid for by increasing the corporate tax rate and the tax rate on Americans earning more than $400,000 a year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/infrastructure-talks-hit-snags-as-senate-time-pressure-rises/articleshow/84776352.cms||---
---||World||Warming rivers in US West killing fish, imperiling industry||WASHINGTON: Baby salmon are dying by the thousands in one California river, and an entire run of endangered salmon could be wiped out in another. Fishermen who make their living off adult salmon, once they enter the Pacific Ocean, are sounding the alarm as blistering heat waves and extended drought in the U.S. West raise water temperatures and imperil fish from Idaho to California. Hundreds of thousands of young salmon are dying in Northern California's Klamath River as low water levels brought about by drought allow a parasite to thrive, devastating a Native American tribe whose diet and traditions are tied to the fish. And wildlife officials said the Sacramento River is facing a ``near-complete loss'' of young Chinook salmon due to abnormally warm water. A crash in one year's class of young salmon can have lasting effects on the total population and shorten or stop the fishing season, a growing concern as climate change continues to make the West hotter and drier. That could be devastating to the commercial salmon fishing industry, which in California alone is worth $1.4 billion. The plummeting catch already has led to skyrocketing retail prices for salmon, hurting customers who say they can no longer afford the $35 per pound of fish, said Mike Hudson, who has spent the last 25 years catching and selling salmon at farmers markets in Berkeley. Hudson said he has considered retiring and selling his 40-foot (12-meter) boat because ``it's going to get worse from here.'' Winter-run Chinook salmon are born in the Sacramento River, traverse hundreds of miles to the Pacific, where they normally spend three years before returning to their birthplace to mate and lay their eggs between April and August. Unlike the fall-run Chinook that survives almost entirely due to hatchery breeding programs, the winter run is still largely reared in the wild. Federal fisheries officials predicted in May that more than 80% of baby salmon could die because of warmer water in the Sacramento River. Now, state wildlife officials say that number could be higher amid a rapidly depleting pool of cool water in Lake Shasta. California's largest reservoir is filled to only about 35% capacity, federal water managers said this week. ``The pain we're going to feel is a few years from now, when there will be no naturally spawned salmon out in the ocean,'' said John McManus, executive director of the Golden State Salmon Association, which represents the fishing industry. When Lake Shasta was formed in the 1940s, it blocked access to the cool mountain streams where fish traditionally spawned. To ensure their survival, the U.S. government is required to maintain river temperatures below 56 degrees Fahrenheit (13 Celsius) in spawning habitat because salmon eggs generally can't withstand anything warmer. The warm water is starting to affect older fish, too. Scientists have seen some adult fish dying before they can lay their eggs. ``An extreme set of cascading climate events is pushing us into this crisis situation,'' said Jordan Traverso, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Wildlife and Fish. The West has been grappling with a historic drought and recent heat waves worsened by climate change, stressing waterways and reservoirs that sustain millions of people and wildlife. As a result, the state has been trucking millions of salmon raised at hatcheries to the ocean each year, bypassing the perilous downstream journey. State and federal hatcheries take other extraordinary measures to preserve the decimated salmon stocks, such as maintaining a genetic bank to prevent inbreeding at hatcheries and releasing them at critical life stages, when they can recognize and return to the water where they were born. Fishermen and environmental groups blame water agencies for diverting too much water too soon to farms, which could lead to severe salmon die-off and drive the species closer to extinction. ``We know that climate change is going to make years like this more common, and what the agencies should be doing is managing for the worst-case scenario,'' said Sam Mace, a director of Save Our Wild Salmon, a coalition working to restore wild salmon and steelhead in the Pacific Northwest. ``We need some real changes in how rivers are managed if they're going to survive,'' she added. On the Klamath River near the Oregon state line, California wildlife officials decided not to release more than 1 million young Chinook salmon into the wild and instead drove them to hatcheries that could host them until river conditions improve. Much is riding on this class of salmon because it could be the first to return to the river if plans to remove four of six dams on the Klamath and restore fish access to the upper river go according to plan. Across the West, officials are struggling with the similar concerns over fish populations. In Idaho, officials recognized that endangered sockeye salmon wouldn't make their upstream migration through hundreds of miles of warm water to their spawning habitat, so they flooded the Snake River with cool water, then trapped and trucked the fish to hatcheries. And environmentalists went to court this month in Portland, Oregon, to try to force dam operators on the Snake and Columbia rivers to release more water at dams blocking migrating salmon, arguing that the effects of climate change and a recent heat wave were further threatening fish already on the verge of extinction. Low water levels are also affecting recreational fishing. Officials in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana and California are asking anglers to fish during the coolest parts of the day to minimize the impact on fish stressed from low-oxygen levels in warm water. Scientists say the salmon population in California historically has rebounded after a drought because they have evolved to tolerate the Mediterranean-like climate and benefited from rainy, wet years. But an extended drought could lead to extinction of certain runs of salmon. ``We're at the point where I'm not sure drought is appropriate term to describe what's happening,'' said Andrew Rypel, a fish ecologist at the University of California, Davis. He said the West is transitioning to an increasingly water-scarce environment. Hudson, the fisherman, said he used to spend days at sea when the salmon season was longer and could catch 100 fish per day. This year, he said he was lucky to catch 80 to sell at the market. ``Retiring would be the smart thing to do, but I can't bring myself to do it because these fish have been so good to us for all these years,'' Hudson said. ``I can't just walk away from it.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/warming-rivers-in-us-west-killing-fish-imperiling-industry/articleshow/84776704.cms||---

The questions were scheduled to be taken up on Monday but showed up on the list as ‘cancelled and deleted’, ostensibly because Sen “was robbed of all entitlements”, including participating in the proceedings of the House, moving notices and asking questions, when he was placed under suspension last week. While Rajya Sabha sources said this was done as per “convention and practise”, former Lok Sabha secretary general, PDT Achary referred to the move as unprecedented. Speaking to TOI, Achary said that while suspension of a member from the House limits his physical entry into the inner lobby and chambers of the House, it does not deprive him of his “basic rights” as a member, which includes the right to ask questions. When contacted, TMC MP Santanu Sen said, “My suspension from the House by itself was unparliamentary since it was not included in the list of business, nor on the supplementary list. How can one expect parliamentary behaviour from an unparliamentary party? Therefore, my party will raise this issue in the House on Tuesday.” Rajya Sabha sources, however, maintained that this was not the first time an individual or a group of MPs placed under suspension were denied permission to pose questions in the House. The source said the Rajya Sabha table office, on July 23, conveyed to Sen that no notices moved by him during the suspension will be admissible. It also said notices tabled by the member “prior to his suspension” shall also “not be included or admitted in the List of Business or Lists of Questions or List of Amendments in respect of Bills etc. during the period of his suspension”. Sen was suspended from the House on July 23 for snatching and tearing up a copy of the government’s statement on Pegasus snooping, which Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu had referred to as an “assault on the country’s parliamentary democracy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rajya-sabha-cancels-deletes-questions-asked-by-suspended-tmc-mp-former-secretary-general-calls-it-against-parliamentary-procedure/articleshow/84771444.cms||Swati Mathur
---||World||Trump inaugural chair: I'm '100% innocent' in lobbying case||NEW YORK: The chair of former President Donald Trump's 2017 inaugural committee pleaded not guilty Monday and said he was “100per cent innocent” of charges that he secretly lobbied the US on behalf of the United Arab Emirates. Tom Barrack, 74, wearing a black mask to protect against the coronavirus, appeared in Brooklyn federal court for the first time, days after he was freed on USD250 million bail following his arrest in California. His lawyer entered his plea for him. “As you'd expect, the system is working. I think what you'll find is that … over time, you'll all see that I'm 100per cent innocent," Barrack said as he left the courthouse. Prosecutors say Barrack used his multidecade friendship with Trump to influence the Republican's policy, starting when Trump was a candidate in 2016 and continuing after he was sworn in as president. At the time, the UAE was in a tense diplomatic conflict with Qatar. Prosecutors said that, among other things, Barrack provided Emirati government officials with information about how senior US officials viewed the dispute. A group of countries, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain, launched a blockade against Qatar in mid-2017. Prosecutors said Barrack boasted to contacts in the Emirates that he could help them gain influence with the then-new administration, even as he was seeking a post as ambassador to the UAE or as special envoy to the Middle East. Federal authorities say Barrack broke the law by failing to disclose his UAE ties to the US government. On Friday, a Los Angeles magistrate judge approved a USD250 million bail deal negotiated between Barrack's lawyers and federal prosecutors. The arrangement required Barrack to give up passports and submit to electronic monitoring. It also imposed a curfew. Barrack is charged with conspiracy, obstruction of justice and making false statements during a June 2019 interview with federal agents. Barrack, who has an electronic ankle bracelet to comply with monitoring requirements, plans to live in Aspen, Colorado, while he awaits trial, his lawyers said. He also pledged to only fly on commercial flights. He is subject to a curfew and various other restrictions, including limits on financial transactions and bans on communications with officials from the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Matthew Grimes, 27, an Aspen-based former executive at Barrack's company, and Rashid al Malik, 43, an Emirati businessman who prosecutors said acted as a conduit to that nation's rulers, were also charged in the seven-count indictment. Grimes also appeared Monday in Brooklyn federal court, where his lawyer entered a not guilty plea for him. Al Malik fled the US three days after an April 2018 interview by law enforcement and remains at large, authorities said. He is believed to be living somewhere in the Middle East. Barrack was an informal adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign before becoming the inaugural committee chair. The indictment against Barrack made no allegations of wrongdoing by the inaugural committee or by Trump. A pretrial hearing for Barrack and Grimes was scheduled for Sept. 2, when a trial judge rather than a magistrate judge will preside over what was described as a telephonic conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-inaugural-chair-im-100-innocent-in-lobbying-case/articleshow/84777138.cms||---

The restaurant Serendipity 3 already claims world records for the most expensive burger ($295) and ice cream sundae ($1,000), so if the question is, "you want fries with that?" its answer is a resounding yes. Guinness World Records certified the feat. As of July 13, the fries are officially the most expensive on earth. "Serendipity is really a happy place," said Creative Director and Chef Joe Calderone. "People come here to celebrate, to really escape the reality of life sometimes." The Crème de la Crème Pomme Frites start out as Chipperbec potatoes. They are blanched, or scalded, in vinegar and champagne. Then they fry in pure goose fat, not oil, and not once but twice, so they are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Sprinkled with edible gold and seasoned with truffle salt and truffle oil, they are served on a crystal plate with an orchid, thin-sliced truffles, and a Mornay cheese dip. The sauce, too, is infused with truffles, a rare seasonal mushroom. "Truffle is the main star here," said Corporate Executive Chef Frederick Schoen-Kiewert. Like many restaurants, Serendipity was closed during the Covid-19 pandemic and Calderone and Schoen-Kiewert thought the fancy fries would be a good way to announce its return. It's working. There is an eight- to 10-week wait list for the fries. "It's been a rough year and a half for everyone, and we need to have some fun now," said Calderone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-yorks-200-french-fries-offer-escape-from-reality/articleshow/84777300.cms||---

As talks of Yediyurappa’s exit intensified, the 16 ‘outsiders’, who crossed the aisle to join BJP in 2019, were in a state of flux over their own future prospects. Sources in the BJP suggest that the new CM who will be hand-picked by the central leadership, no matter who it is, will in all probability try to axe the 11 ‘outsider ministers’ in the cabinet to accommodate more youngsters and party loyalists, who have held a grudge for not getting their due. “However, we do not know how many of them will go as the decision will depend on various factors, including the central leadership’s diktat,” said one party legislator. Meanwhile, the legislators who switched camps and later made the ministerial cut told TOI they are confident the central leadership won’t wash its hands of them. “It doesn’t matter what happens next. Whatever the party high command decides, we will act accordingly. Whether they retain us as ministers or not, it is a decision we have to abide by,” said Byrathi Basavaraj, who held the urban development portfolio. While some say only those ministers who have performed well might be retained, others think all ‘outsider ministers’ could be given nominal posts of chairpersons to boards and corporations. However, the bunch which propelled the BJP government to power when it was falling short of numbers is hoping the party brass will honour Yediyurappa’s word, for he is the one who brought them into the party fold. “Yediyurappa gave us his word as a BJP CM and not as an individual. I expect the party to honour his word and persist with us (as ministers),” said outgoing agriculture minister BC Patil. They even suggested that if BJP reneges on it promise, it will only dent the image of the saffron party. Opposition leader Siddaramaiah too feels BJP is likely to continue with the ‘outsiders’. “After all, the party cannot ignore the fact that they are the reason why the BJP is in power,” he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/migrant-mins-hoping-bjp-brass-will-honour-bsys-word-and-retain-them/articleshow/84777488.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

The last time he cried publicly was when he was forced by the Reddy brothers to drop his close aide Shobha Karandlaje from his cabinet in 2009. The Lingayat leader failed to control his emotions when he announced his resignation but said he wasn't bidding farewell in sadness. “Vajpayee once asked me to become the Union minister. But I declined. I told him I need to build the party in Karnataka, and I will not come to Delhi. I told him to allow me to build the party,” he said. He added that he is not an aspirant for any constitutional post. “Neither am I aspiring for the governor’s post nor would I accept it if offered. I am not retiring from active politics. I will tour the state and strengthen the party to bring it to power in 2023 with a clear majority,” he said. In parting, he had some advice for his colleagues and officers. “For some reason, people are losing faith in elected representatives and officers. As our Prime Minister Modi says, we need to work with honesty and sincerity to take the state and country forward.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/strongman-gets-teary-eyed/articleshow/84777499.cms||Anil Gejji

The database accessed by French non-profit Forbidden Stories and shared with the project’s media consortium, included not only two of Singh’s numbers but four numbers belonging to three women from his family, implying they too were likely targets. V K Jain, a former IAS officer who worked as a personal assistant to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, also appears to have marked as a person of interest. In addition, the leaked records contain details of the numbers of at least one official each from the PMO and NITI Aayog, The Wire said. Read AlsoPegasus in Kashmir: More than 25 from Valley were selected as potential targetsNEW DELHI: Besides Delhi-based Kashmiri journalists and a prominent civil society activist critical of official policy towards Jammu and Kashmir, more than 25 people from the Kashmir Valley were selected as potential targets of intrusive surveillance between 2017 and mid-2019 by an as yetSingh, a provincial police service officer (PPS) from Uttar Pradesh, has been with the ED since 2009, during which he had served on the investigation of several sensitive cases such as the 2G spectrum scam and the Aircel-Maxis matter. He has also been involved in the probes into the Sahara group and the disproportionate assets case of Andhra chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy. His run in the database stretches from late 2017 to mid-2019, which is around the time when the leaked data itself tapers off. His second number appears to have been of interest from the spring of 2018 onward. This is also when two numbers registered to his wife are added, as are the numbers of his two sisters, one of whom, Abha Singh, is an IAS officer-turned-lawyer based in Mumbai. The Pegasus Project list also includes the phone number used by V K Jain, who was appointed as chief consultant at CM Kejriwal's office. Jain's phone number appears in the leaked records in 2018, when, according to sources in the Delhi government, he handled the most significant files of the state government. As Kejriwal's primary aide during his first full term, Jain is closely tied to implementation of the CM’s most prized welfare programmes like improving school education and health infrastructure in the city-state. Significantly, his phone number appears in the records soon after he was questioned by the Delhi Police in connection with the alleged assault on Delhi chief secretary Anshu Prakash by two AAP legislators in February 2018. The incident occurred during a meeting between AAP leaders and Prakash over the issue of 'Door Step Delivery of Ration' and the slow processing of files. While Prakash registered an FIR over the alleged assault, the AAP legislators denied the charge, The Wire said. The leaked records indicate that the telephone number of a senior employee of the NITI Aayog— the Union government's policy think-tank — was also included as a probable target for surveillance. The Wire verified the number and spoke to the person involved but is withholding their identity at their request as they are no longer working at the government body. An officer who is currently an undersecretary in the PMO was also selected for potential surveillance in 2017, the leaked records show. He was in charge of PM Modi's tours in 2017 when the Indian client of the NSO Group showed interest in him, The Wire said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-cms-ex-aide-2-airline-heads-ed-man-on-pegasus-list-says-report/articleshow/84777502.cms||---
---||World||Winds stoke California’s largest fire as blazes scorch West||INDIAN FALLS, CALIFORNIA: Erratic winds and the potential for dry lightning added to the challenges facing firefighters battling California’s largest wildfire, one of numerous blazes burning Monday across the US West. Over the weekend, the massive Dixie Fire merged with the smaller Fly Fire and tore through the remote Northern California community of Indian Falls. The blaze had already leveled at least 16 houses and other structures, but a new damage estimate wasn’t immediately available because flames were still raging in the mountain area. “Fire behavior has been so unpredictable, it hasn’t been safe for inspectors to go in to work,” said Mitch Matlow, a fire spokesman. “Until things settle down, we won’t know the extent of what’s burned.” Flames spread in remote areas with steep terrain crews can’t easily reach, Matlow said. Gusty winds also hindered containment efforts and the problem could get worse with the predicted arrival later Monday of pyrocumulus clouds — literally meaning “ fire clouds ” — which can bring lightning and the risk of new ignitions. Fire officials said the blaze had charred nearly 309 square miles (800 square kilometers) of timber and brush in Plumas and Butte counties, about two hours northeast of Sacramento. It was 22% contained and more than 10,000 homes were still under threat. Authorities were hopeful that improving weather will help them continue to make progress against the nation’s largest wildfire, the Bootleg Fire in southern Oregon. It was 53% contained after scorching 640 square miles (1,657 square kilometers) of remote land. On Monday, an additional crew of Oregon National Guardsmen were sent to help out the more than 2,200 people battling the blaze. The lightning-caused fire has burned at least 70 homes, mainly cabins, and some 2,000 residences were under evacuation orders. In Montana, four firefighters were released from a hospital and a fifth was being treated at a burn center Monday after a wildfire overran them last week, authorities said. The five were building a defensive line at the Devil’s Creek Fire in Garfield County when winds shifted suddenly and blew flames back at them. The firefighter still being treated — a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employee — “is making good progress and is in good spirits,” spokesperson Kari Cobb said. Crews were trying to keep the 10-square-mile (26-square-kilometer) fire from reaching Fort Peck Reservoir along the Missouri River in central Montana. It’s one of three major fires in the state. Firefighters have frequently dealt with perilous fire behavior, with flames consuming huge areas of vegetation each day. Such conditions are often from a combination of unusual random, short-term and natural weather patterns heightened by long-term, human-caused climate change. Global warming has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years. Across the West this summer, firefighters have confronted an unusually large number of unpredictable early season fires, U.S. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore said. He recalled a recent small blaze in the Lava Beds area of California that firefighters thought they had doused, only to have the fire flare up again after it burned through a system of tree roots and travelled beneath a containment line. “It’s off the charts in terms of how some of these fires are behaving,” Moore said. Elsewhere in California, the 105-square-mile (272-square-kilometer) Tamarack Fire south of Lake Tahoe continued to burn through timber and chaparral and threatened communities on both sides of the California-Nevada state line. The fire, sparked by lightning July 4 in Alpine County, California, has destroyed at least 23 buildings, including more than a dozen in Nevada. It was 45% contained. In north-central Washington, firefighters battled two blazes in Okanogan County that threatened hundreds of homes and again caused hazardous air quality conditions over the weekend. And in northern Idaho, east of Spokane, Washington, a small fire near the Silverwood Theme Park prompted evacuations Friday evening at the park and in the surrounding area. The theme park was back open with the fire half contained. More than 85 large wildfires were burning across the country, most of them in Western states. They had burned over 2,343 square miles (6,068 square kilometers) of land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/winds-stoke-californias-largest-fire-as-blazes-scorch-west/articleshow/84777538.cms||---

On Saturday, the US Geological Survey announced average daily water levels had dropped about an inch below the previous record of 4,191.4 feet (1,278 meters), which was set in 1963.  The new record comes months earlier than when the lake typically hits its lowest level of the year, indicating water levels could continue to drop even further, said Candice Hasenyager, the deputy director of Utah's Division of Water Resources.  Receding water s are already affecting a nesting spot for pelicans, which are among the millions of birds dependent on the lake. Sailboats have been hoisted out of the water to keep them from getting stuck in the mud. More dry lakebed getting exposed could send arsenic-laced dust into the air that millions breathe.  People for years have been diverting water from rivers that flow into the lake to water crops and supply homes. Because the lake is shallow - about 35 feet (11 meters) at its deepest pointless water quickly translates to receding shorelines.  Most years, the Great Salt Lake gains up to 2 feet (half a meter) from spring runoff. This year, it was just 6 inches (15 centimetres).  The drought is drying up lakes across the West and worsening massive wildfires affecting California and Oregon. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, has begged people to cut back on lawn watering and "pray for rain."  Extreme conditions like these are often from a combination of unusual random, short-term and natural weather patterns heightened by long-term, human-caused climate change.  Scientists have long warned that the weather will get wilder as the world warms, and climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/water-levels-at-great-salt-lake-drop-to-historic-low/articleshow/84777588.cms||---

The new rule will take effect next month, officials announced on Monday. There are at least 238,000 state employees, according to the California controller's office, and at least 2 million health care workers in the public and private sectors. While about 62% of all eligible Californians are fully vaccinated, the state has struggled to make significant progress in recent weeks. Infections and hospitalizations are rising, with the highly contagious delta variant now making up an estimated 80% of cases in California, though the growing numbers are still far below where they were during the winter peak. "An individual's choice not to get vaccinated is now impacting the rest of us in a profound and devastating and deadly way," Governor Gavin Newsom said in announcing the new policy. Despite the change for state workers and increasing infections, the Democratic governor has been hesitant to impose new requirements on mask-wearing or social distancing since he allowed the state to reopen on June 15. It comes as Newsom faces a recall election in September that's largely over his handling of the pandemic, with California having been the first to impose a statewide stay-at-home order last year and business and school shutdowns lasting longer than many other states. Now, local governments like Los Angeles County (the nation's largest county) are requiring or urging residents again to wear masks indoors. And cities and counties in the San Francisco Bay Area previously imposed Covid-19 vaccination requirements for workers. Santa Clara County officials said they plan to require all 22,000 county employees to get vaccinations, not waiting for the Food and Drug Administration to grant full approval for the Covid-19 vaccine to implement the policy, which is still being developed. Officials said most employees are already fully vaccinated. New York City also announced Monday that it will require all of its municipal workers, including teachers and police officers, to get vaccines by mid-September or face weekly testing. In California, those without proof of vaccination will continue to be required to wear masks at work. "If they're not vaccinated and we cannot verify that they've been vaccinated, we are requiring that they get tested," Newsom said of state workers. "California is committed to vaccination, verification and or testing on a weekly basis. We're not stopping just with state employees.'' He said vaccine verification will also be required in jails and homeless shelters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/california-to-require-vaccine-or-testing-for-state-workers/articleshow/84777614.cms||---

Responding to a question in Lok Sabha, junior minister for finance Pankaj Choudhury said till the end of May, in the Panama Papers cases, undisclosed credits of Rs 20,078 crore have been detected, with another Rs 246 crore detected in the Paradise Papers cases.

Similarly, undisclosed income of Rs. 8,465 crore has been brought to tax and penalty of Rs 1,294 crores has been levied in HSBC cases, the minister said. Further, undisclosed income of Rs 11,010 crore has been detected in International Consortium of Investigative Journalists cases.

---||India||After days of suspense, B S Yediyurappa finally resigns as Karnataka CM; 6 names shortlisted for his successor||BENGALURU: Ending months of speculation over a leadership change in Karnataka, chief minister B S Yediyurappa on Monday announced his resignation in an emotional speech during an event to commemorate two years of his government in the state. Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot accepted Yediyurappa's resignation and asked him to continue as caretaker chief minister till the next CM is sworn in. The Lingayat strongman's decision to step aside now sets the stage for a new era in Karnataka politics and for BJP in particular as the party's fortunes have been wedded to BSY's rise in the southern state. Hours after he resigned, the BJP high command announced to send a team of observers led by Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan to Bengaluru to oversee a meeting of the legislative party to elect the next chief minister in a couple of days. Senior party sources indicated the choice will be from the current crop of legislators. It is yet to be known who will succeed the 78-year-old Lingayat leader with several names doing the rounds and most of the party's senior leadership in the state throwing their hats into the ring. Choosing a successor will be a test as influential Lingayat mutts have protested against BSY's resignation, and the community is key to BJP's electoral strength in the state. But the BJP high command seems to have succeeded in coopting Yediyurappa's support for his successor and staved off the possibility of a miffed former CM playing spoilsport by sulking on the sidelines. TOI had reported the impending change of guard in its edition dated July 18. The decks had been cleared when BSY visited Delhi earlier this month and met the BJP brass, including PM Narendra Modi. BJP national general secretary and Karnataka in-charge Arun Singh said the decision is left to the party's parliamentary board and the BJP legislature party. "The parliamentary board of BJP will decide the next CM on Tuesday and later it will be announced at the legislature party meeting," Singh told reporters in New Delhi. Read AlsoWith B S Yediyurappa on board, BJP confident of smooth transition in KarnatakaWhile the resignation of B S Yediyurappa has the political circles speculating about the fallout in terms of how he has taken it and in the context of possible resentment among his fellow Lingayats, the BJP leadership is confident of managing the transition well.Speculation is rife that names from the Lingayat community as well as non-Lingayats who have strong Hindutva leanings are being considered. Among Lingayats, Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, Arvind Bellad and Basavaraj Bommai are being mentioned and B L Santosh, Visveshwara Hedge Kageri and C T Ravi are some other names. Yediyurappa resigned even as several seers from various mutts across Karnataka were rallying behind him warning BJP of consequences. Some senior Congress MLAs, in a strategic move, too had extended moral support to BJP’s Lingayat leader. In a teary-eyed speech to mark his two years in office earlier in the day, BSY was seen breaking down on the stage frequently as he recalled his struggle to build the party and how he faced agni pariksha as CM without much support from outside. In an indication that the BJP high command has succeeded in ensuring a smooth transition, Yediyurappa after submitting his resignation, said, "Nobody pressured me to resign. I did it on my own so that someone else can take over as CM after the completion of two years of government. I’ll work to bring BJP back in power in the next election. I've not given the name of anyone who should succeed me." He also assured that he and his supporters shall give their 100% to whoever is the next chief minister The speculation about a change of guard had been doing the rounds since he completed his first year in office but the Covid pandemic turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Yediyurappa to continue. The move became imminent after Yediyurappa earlier this month met PM Modi, Union minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda. Dissidence had been brewing within BJP over the last few months against Yediyurappa’s style of functioning. Several MLAs, including some ministers in his cabinet, were openly criticising Yediyurappa and his son on various issues. Some also had met the brass in Delhi seeking a change of leadership with an eye on the 2023 assembly polls citing Yediyurappa’s age and health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-days-of-suspense-b-s-yediyurappa-finally-resigns-as-karnataka-cm-6-names-shortlisted-for-his-successor/articleshow/84777646.cms||---

In the letter, a copy of which is with TOI, BSY wrote, “I am grateful to you for providing me the opportunity to serve the people of Karnataka. However, with my prevailing health situation, I have not been able to do complete justice in the administration. Hence, I am requesting you to relieve me from my position as Chief Minister of Karnataka. I will fully cooperate with you in selecting the next suitable replacement. I will continue to work for the party and for the welfare of the people. I will give my service in the nation-building exercise under your leadership. Kindly accept my resignation and allow me to discharge from my duties. Thank you.” Thereafter, BSY simply had to draft a letter of resignation to the governor, as he finally did on Monday, and hand it over to satisfy the constitutional requirement. However, he delayed doing so. BSY’s letter was delivered to the PM on July 11. Modi then met BSY on July 16. Interestingly, this was the first time the two had met one-on-one in a decade. According to sources, BSY was keen to stay on till August 15; he also didn’t want to quit in the month of ashada. But he is said to have been given a deadline of July 26, when he would complete two years in office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/had-offered-to-quit-in-letter-to-modi-on-july-10/articleshow/84777661.cms||Sugata Srinivasaraju
---||India||A life lived and buried in the lap of nature||JAIPUR: She found joy in the lap of nature and the freedom to open a window to her soul on social media. In hindsight, Deepa Sharma's pinned tweet had a prophetic ring to it, “I am not a IAS/IPS, IIM, Ivy League school pass out, any celebrity or any politician, but I am confident. In few years, people will know my name very well for my good work and my professional attributes for our Nation and for #WomenEmpowerment.” A day after her death in the landslide in Himachal Pradesh's Kinnaur that killed eight other tourists on Sunday, the 34-year-old Jaipur-based Ayurveda practitioner's life was celebrated as much as her passing was mourned by 22.4k Twitter followers and thousands of others moved by the tragedy. Deepa had purchased a DSLR camera and a new mobile phone just ahead of the solo trip so that she could indulge in her passion for nature photography and document every little detail for her website drdeepasharma.com, where she would post her pictures and poetry. “She was planning to celebrate her 35th birthday on July 29 at Spiti,” said Deepa's sister-in-law Kavita Sharma as the family waited in Delhi on Monday for the body to arrive. Actor Kangana Ranaut, whom Deepa had met more than a couple of times, was among those who paid tributes. “She was a great fan, she sent me lovely letters and showered me with gifts and sweets...also visited my house in Manali... Oh !!! Seems like a big jolt… This is beyond tragic... Oh, God!!!" she wrote. Those close to Deepa recalled her as a vivacious, independent and fiercely opinionated person on women's issues, politics and society. During the peak of the pandemic, she would help whoever was in distress in every way she could, her family and friends said. “Besides being a good photographer, her Hindi poetry was evocative. She once wrote, ‘Zindagi kisey kehte hain jo waqt ke saath behti jaaye ya jisse waqt baha le jaaye (Life is what flows with time or what time washes away)'. Time has indeed taken her away,” said a friend from her Shanti Nagar neighbourhood. Deepa's penultimate tweet was, “Life is nothing without Mother Nature”. Moments before nature unleashed her fury the next day, she posted what would be the final picture, showing her next to a signboard of the Indo Tibetan Border Police Force and “standing at the last point of India where civilians are allowed”. She would have wanted people to “know my name” in some other way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/a-life-lived-and-buried-in-the-lap-of-nature/articleshow/84777784.cms||Ashish Mehta

Lok Sabha was adjourned by presiding officer Rama Devi after the two bills were passed. The House had to be adjourned four times as opposition MPs refused to relent despite repeated requests of the presiding officers, insisting that their demand for an inquiry into telephone hacking allegations be met. Acrimonious scenes were also seen after the House was adjourned as TMC MPs, led by Kalyan Banerjee, continued shouting “shame, shame” targeting parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi for introduction of the bills. Earlier, the House displayed a brief moment of unanimity in congratulating weightlifter Saikhom Mirabai Chanu for her silver at the Tokyo Olympics. Moving the Factoring Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020 for consideration and passage, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the changes in the legislation are aimed at helping the MSME sector. The amendments to the factoring law are based on the recommendations of the U K Sinha Committee. She said the government has accepted the recommendations of the standing committee, which had last year scrutinised the bill. The bill was approved by Lok Sabha by voice vote without any debate. Soon after, the House approved the National Institutes of Food Technology, Entrepreneurship and Management Bill, 2021 piloted by the new food processing industries minister Pashupati Kumar Paras. In Rajya Sabha, slogan-shouting opposition MPs forced repeated adjournments over the Pegasus controversy, even as chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu expressed concern that around 90 members had been denied the opportunity to raise important issues due to the continuing disruption of proceedings, just as Speaker Om Birla observed in the lower House that asking questions was a basic job of parliamentarians. Soon after the proceedings began in Rajya Sabha after laying of papers, opposition members began chanting slogans against the government to stop “snooping” and phone-tapping, with some of them entering the well with placards of “Big brother is watching”. Ignoring repeated pleas by Naidu and deputy chairperson Harivansh to restore order. The House had to be adjourned thrice in second session as the opposition continued with its protests. Leader of the House Piyush Goyal said he had approached the leader of the opposition and principal opposition parties but there was no consensus among them. “I have requested everyone to join me for a cup of tea for an informal discussion last Friday. Two of the principal parties refused to come for that also,” said Goyal, adding the protests by some of the opposition parties were harmful for India’s democracy. Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge sought a debate under Rule 267 which was not allowed by the Chair. A total of 69 zero hour mentions, including 12 admitted for Monday, and 23 special mentions by as many members could not be raised during the last week and Monday due to persistent disruptions. These matters covered wide-ranging issues, ranging from shortage of Covid-19 vaccines and rising unemployment due to the continuing pandemic to fuel hikes and the resultant increase in prices of essential commodities, and alleged attacks on the freedom of press and the situation in Lakshadweep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lok-sabha-passes-two-bills-amid-din-rajya-sabha-faces-washout-due-to-opposition-protests-over-pegasus-row/articleshow/84777874.cms||---

With the whole area flooded, Ranjeet RajeShirke realised that only the roof of one of the submerged buses was a safe bet. He and six of his team members climbed atop a bus around 5.30am and stayed there for nine hours holding on to a bag containing the cash before NDRF rescued them. “It was scary. There were moments when the water level was so high that the bus began to shake and we feared we could be thrown off any moment. But we stood firm,” RajeShirke said. The government now plans to felicitate them, reports Somit Sen. As he recalled the horror last Thursday, he said, “It was around 4.30am last Thursday that I reached the depot amid heavy rains and saw the entire depot was flooded and water level was rising. The release of dam water made the situation worse and although rains had stopped for a while, the water kept flowing into the depot and the buses were submerged.” “There was no other place I could think of as there were chances of the cash being destroyed in flood water. It was then that I decided to go on the roof of a bus,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-flood-st-staff-sat-atop-bus-9-hours-with-rs-9-lakh/articleshow/84777919.cms||Somit Sen

Launching “Sujal — Drink from Tap Mission” via a virtual platform, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik said on Monday that Puri has joined international cities like London, New York and Singapore in supplying quality piped drinking water from taps 24x7. “The launch… in Puri is a new chapter in Odisha’s development. It makes the heritage city the first in India to achieve this milestone, matching the standards of supply of drinking water in many foreign cities. Around 2.5 lakh people of Puri town and two crore tourists visiting the city every year can now get quality drinking water from taps, doing away with the need to store and filter water,” Patnaik said in his address. Drinking water fountains have been set up at 400 locations in the pilgrim town to ensure that visitors do not carry plastic bottles. The government hopes that the Sujal piped water scheme will eliminate the use of three crore plastic bottles, thereby preventing the formation of 400 metric tonnes of plastic waste in Puri every year. “Sujal, which is a transformative project under the government’s 5T charter (Transparency, teamwork, technology, time frame and transformation), has been commissioned in only nine months. The project will subsequently be extended to 16 other urban localities with a 40-lakh population,” he said. Quality drinking water is closely linked with good health, the human development index and the economy, the CM said. To ensure that the state gets safe and hygienic drinking water, the Odisha government has increased its budget from Rs 200 crore to Rs 4,000 crore in the last five years. The initiative has been launched under the “Jalsathi” programme and involves joining hands with women’s self-help groups (SHGs) under Mission Shakti, a state initiative to empower women, according to the government. Quality check of the drinking water will be conducted by “Jalsathis” picked from the women’s SHGs. Union ministry of housing and urban affair’s secretary Durga Shanker Mishra, who attended the launch, said it would work as a role model for other states. Chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra, 5T secretary V K Pandian, state housing and urban development secretary G Mathi Vathanan and minister Pratap Jena were among others who attended the launch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/puri-first-indian-city-to-get-24x7-piped-drinking-water-supply/articleshow/84778014.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

They also alleged that the CBI officials had subjected them to third degree methods to obtain false confessions. One Yadati Sunil Yadav (26) filed the petition along with his father, Krishnaiah; mother, Savitri; and his younger brother, Kiran Yadav. They are all residents of Motunuthalapalli in YSR Kadapa district. T L Nayan Kumar, the counsel for the petitioners, argued on Monday that the CBI officials summoned Sunil Yadav to Delhi by issuing 160 CrPC notices in March. He was made to stay in Delhi for more than 50 days in the name of investigation and subjected to third degree methods. The CBI officials even carried out a lie detector test on him, he said. Nayan Kumar said that the CBI officials again summoned him and his family members to Kadam jail for the investigation. He contended that the CBI officials did not follow due procedure in summoning them and applied third degree methods to extract false confession statements from them. He alleged that the CBI officials beat him and his younger brother, who is working with Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC). The family sought court directions to the CBI to restrain it from summoning them for investigation and taking any coercive steps, including arrest. The counsel of the CBI, A Chenna Kesavulu, denied the allegations. He sought time to file a counter affidavit stating all facts before advancing his arguments. Justice Ch Manavendranath Roy allowed his request and posted the matter for further hearing on July 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/family-alleges-third-degree-by-cbi-to-extract-false-confessions/articleshow/84770836.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Colleges are expecting a tough competition as the cut-off marks is expected to be high this year. “We received overwhelming response since applications were opened. With the CBSE board exam results delayed, we stalled preparation of the rank list as per quota for now. We can expect a really tough competition for seats among all categories as recommendations for seats are flooding in already,” said Christianna Singh, principal, Lady Doak College. “There is massive demand for commerce courses. We received around 3,400 applications for the BCom regular course alone. There is a similar high demand for BCom (CA) course too. Out of the 3,400 applications, more than 100 have more than 96% marks, so a very tough competition for seats is expected,” said Davamani M Christober, principal, The American College. He further said that applications were received from students who were from southern districts like Theni, Tirunelveli, Tuticorin, Ramanathapuram and Kanyakumari. “We are seeing good response for applications similar to last year. Apart from commerce, computer science and other science groups are in demand as usual,” said D Pandiaraja, principal, Thiagarajar College of Arts and Science. More applications are expected to flood colleges in the coming week as online applications for government arts and science colleges opened on Monday.

---||Patna||RJD demands debate on March 23 police violence||PATNA: In a unique way of protest, several RJD legislators came to the legislative assembly on the first day of the monsoon session wearing helmets as ‘self-protection’ measures. They resorted to such steps in protest of manhandling of the opposition MLAs by police during the passage of the Bihar Special Armed Police (BSAP) Bill in the budget session on March 23. RJD MLA from Makhdumpur (Jehanabad district) Satish Kumar arrived wearing a cricket helmet and also carried a pair of brass cymbals, while his party MLA from Mahua, Mukesh Roshan, wore a motorcycle helmet. Satish also carried a placard, which read ‘Jago Nitish Kumar… (Nitish Kumar, wake up)’. As a mark of their symbolic protest against the March 23 police action, the RJD, Congress, CPI(ML), CPI and CPM MLAs also wore black masks. Earlier, assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha said two constables found guilty of transgressions of the protocol have been suspended. But leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav maintained that no action has been taken against police officers who gave the order to the constables to beat up the MLAs. On July 15, in a letter to the Speaker, Tejashwi had said the MLAs were scared of entering the House during the monsoon session. On Monday, Tejashwi wanted to make a statement on the floor, seeking House debate on the March 23 incident and the government’s reply to it, but the Speaker denied it, saying that first the proposal in this regard should be moved on some later date to be considered by him. After the Speaker adjourned the proceedings to meet again on Tuesday, Tejashwi, accompanied by Ajeet Sharma from the Congress, Mahboob Alam from CPI(ML), as well as Lalit Kumar Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav from RJD and legislature party leaders of the CPM and CPI, met the Speaker in his chamber, seeking House debate on any day during the monsoon session. On March 23, pursuing their drive to prevent the passage of the BSAP Bill, the opposition members had even gheraoed the Speaker, besides closing all the gates of his chamber. Earlier that day, a few first-time MLAs had even obstructed the functioning of the presiding member of the House who was in the Speaker’s chair. To clear the assembly premises of the opposition MLAs, the Speaker had called in the police who, in turn, resorted to unrestrained violence, including the manhandling of two women RJD MLAs. Later, the Bill was passed by voice vote amid walkout by the opposition members. Incidentally, Satish was among the few MLAs who was severely beaten up by the police and even flung on the road outside the portico of the House, whereby he sustained injuries in his head and face and was also immediately hospitalized at PMCH for treatment. “Later, I was referred to AIIMS-Delhi for advanced treatment,” Satish recalled and added: “I have come wearing a cricket helmet, thinking I will be able to protect my head, if the police and possible goons resort to violence, again. The cymbals are a reminder to CM Nitish Kumar that he should wake up and take care of the state’s health, education, irrigation and other needs.” Satish entered the House wearing the helmet, but the marshal immediately took it away from him. “Yes, the marshal took it away, as per the rule of the House, and I obliged,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-demands-debate-on-march-23-police-violence/articleshow/84767960.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Kolkata||Covaxin doses finally here, West Bengal targets 3 lakh jabs a day||KOLKATA: With the arrival of 1.5 lakh Covaxin doses on Monday, and the 12 lakh Covishield doses on Friday, state health officials are hopeful of administering about 3 lakh doses a day on an average from now on. The Covaxin consignment will ease the vaccine crisis for the next couple of days, they hoped. The government is expecting more doses this week. “We are expecting between 20 lakh and 22 lakh doses this week,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar. The Centre had initially estimated a share of about 75 lakh doses for Bengal for July. So far, the state’s central family welfare store has received about 55.5 lakh doses. Even though the state had a reserve of Covishield vials last week, Covaxin stock had depleted so sharply that most KMC-run CVCs from where Covaxin was being dispensed had to be shut while government hospital CVCs were supplied enough vials to inoculate just around 50 recipients a day. Health officials said there are close to 2 lakh people whose second dose of Covaxin is due. On Monday, the state’s vaccine store at Bagbazar got 1.5 lakh Covaxin doses from the central government’s depot at Hastings. This supply came after consignments of the vaccine failed to be delivered on schedule on two occasions — on July 21 and on July 23. The vials have been dispatched to cold-chain points across Kolkata and some other districts, like Howrah, North and South 24 Parganas. “We were supposed to get 2.5 lakh Covaxin doses on those two dates. Though only 1.5 lakh doses have arrived, it is a huge relief because we had been unable to meet the demand. We can now utilize this to inoculate people whose second dose is due,” said a health department official. On Friday and Saturday, 3 lakh-plus doses were administered. But the vaccination graph went down on Sunday as many government-run CVCs did not operate. On Monday, till reports last came in, the number of doses administered for the day was inching towards 3 lakh. “We have the capacity of vaccinating more than one-and-a-half crore doses a month without any infrastructure or human resource augmentation. The only constraints to this are inadequate qua-ntity and interrupted supply,” said director health services Ajay Chakraborty. Some private hospitals, too, received, fresh consignments of Covaxin on Monday. AMRI Hospitals received 600 doses and RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) got 2,500 doses. At RTIICS, 1,500 of the 2,500 doses have been reserved for second-dose recipients. “We are going very slow on Covaxin with around 30-40 doses per day since the demand is very low,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covaxin-doses-finally-here-state-targets-3l-jabs-a-day/articleshow/84771798.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The PPU had been carved out of Magadh University (MU) on March 18, 2018. PPU registrar Prof Jitendra Kumar said the university was initially allotted 8.05 acre land near Mithapur bus stand. However, the state government truncated it to 6.8 acre on the plea that it had to spare land for building metro station there. The university had agreed to it, but the process was not expedited so far to hand over the proposed land to the university, which has been functioning from the old branch office of the MU at Kankarbagh. The university has shifted its examination department to a separate building at the Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU) campus on a monthly rent of Rs5 lakh with an aim to streamlining the functioning of the examination department, Kumar said, adding the university is already running its central e-library at the AKU campus. He said the university has got UGC recognition under clause 2(f) only, and not under 12 (B) of the UGC Act 1956, thus depriving it of any financial assistance from the commission. The PPU has PG teaching in 18 subjects at its constituent colleges, but its faculty teachers are still on deputation from other colleges as the state government has not sanctioned posts of teachers for the PG departments despite repeated assurances. Under the UGC rules, each PG department should have its own faculty teachers working on the sanctioned strength posts. The PPU has submitted a proposal to state government to sanction regular posts of professors (18), associate professors (36) and assistant professors (72) for its PG departments as per the UGC rules, but the government curtailed 18 assistant teachers posts at a recent meeting. “Unless we have separate buildings, it is a tough task to run postgraduate classes smoothly,” he said. PPU media in-charge B K Manglam said the university cannot achieve its goal unless it has its own land to give an impetus to academic ambience. “The university does not have its own examination hall to conduct PG examinations smoothly. Needless to say about its own administrative building for better governance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-years-on-ppu-yet-to-get-land-for-building-infra/articleshow/84769229.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada job exchange goes online, others to follow||AMARAVATI: The state government has decided to upgrade all existing employment exchanges into digital exchanges to bring more opportunities to the unemployed youth. After successfully completing the digitalisation of old records in the Vijayawada exchange, the authorities are planning to expand the services to all other districts with more facilities. According to official sources in the department of employment and training, the employment exchanges in the state are utilising the offline Arundhathi software developed in 1993 by AP Technology Society (APTS). The existing offline package is being upgraded into a new portal with backend technology. The authorities of APTS are developing an integrated web application to migrate and convert the old data in the portal as per functional scope of the department. The pilot project implemented in Vijayawada has been successfully completed, paving the way for its expansion. The graduate youth have almost stopped enrolling in the employment exchanges as they were getting more opportunities from the private sector than government agencies. Sources said the government is of the view that the digitalisation would help the government connect with the private market to create more job opportunities. Sources said that the government has decided to implement the digitalisation project in employment exchanges in two phases. In the first phase, all activities of employment exchanges in Arundhathi package will be extracted /converted and migrated to the new portal. It will be integrated with the National Career Service (NCC) portal. Sources said moving to the digitalisation of employment exchanges would not only help unemployed youth from getting timely alerts about offers available in the market, it will also help employers pick up candidates from the available pool. Moreover, digitalisation would help manage records in a tamper-proof manner. “The government is offering weightage to some candidates in different job recruitment examinations. In all such cases, making enrolment in employment exchange mandatory and taking records from the department will make the operations transparent particularly with regard to the seniority of the candidates in the waiting list,” said another official. Similarly, all employment activities will be offered to job seekers as well as employers through the public domain and village and ward secretariats. The government is also contemplating encouraging sponsors to conduct job fairs. “We are planning to conduct job melas at least twice a month in each district. All those enrolled in the digital employment exchanges will receive alerts,” said a senior official. In phase-II, the department is planning to go for integration of the exchanges with other departments including industries, APSSDC, SEEDAP, educational institutions and training providers. The department of employment and training is also planning to rope in different expert agencies to conduct career counseling and vocational guidance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vij-job-exchange-goes-online-others-to-follow/articleshow/84771235.cms||Samdani MN

Four health personnel of the sub-health centre were put under the scanner of investigators. The probe also revealed 65 names in Mondal’s diary, but confirmed 45 as recipients of the vaccine doses. Mondal sold vaccines for anything between Rs 300 and Rs 1,200 per jab. Baruipur SP Vaibhav Tiwari said, “The probe is moving on a fast track. The health situation of each recipient is being monitored and we are taking the initiative so that the recipients get their second dose on time.” Samar Karmakar, one of the recipients at a camp organised by Mondal, said, “I have no health issues. In fact, I got a message on my phone and a certificate on time. But I am now perturbed by repeated police inquiries about the vaccine shot, which has made me suspicious about the dose I received.” Chief medical officer (health) of South 24 Parganas Somnath Mukherjee said, “There will be a camp at Sonarpur on Tuesday to screen the health condition of the people who were vaccinated by Mondal. So far, we have not received any information about the adverse impact on anyone.

But a moment came in the life in Sudarshan Kumar Verma, now 72 and retired as branch head from Jaipur, when he could not even utter a word. Verma’s doctors had to remove his voice box, larynx at Sir Gangaram Hospital in Delhi. He was diagnosed with throat cancer, a kind of head and neck cancer, in 1992, when he was posted in a Delhi branch of his bank. At that time, his family — wife, two daughters and a son — was staying in Bikaner, where he was posted earlier. “I noticed hoarseness in my voice. I was a smoker, being a banker I have to do a lot of work, including lots of calculations, maintaining records. So, I used to smoke two packets of cigarette in a day. But I never knew that it might become a reason for cancer in my throat,” said Verma, who loves music and has a lot of musical instruments in his room in Jaipur. “I remember, my doctors told me about Babu Bhai Mistry, who was a film actor and had the same problem which I was facing. But despite his voice box was removed, he managed to speak. Actually, his doctors had imported tracheoesophageal prosthesis and implanted in his throat. So, he was the first in the country to have this kind of prosthesis. I also decided to import it and my doctors at Sir Gangaram implanted it. It came in $250 at that time. I was the second person in the country to have the prosthesis,” said Verma, who is now helping doctors in the city in awareness programmes, including webinars, in making people aware about the ill effects of tobacco smoking. Sawai Man Singh hospital has developed as a major centre in implanting voice prosthesis for lending voice to patients who have lost their larynx due to throat cancer. “Patients diagnosed with larynx cancer are advised to go for chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but they have an option of getting their cancer-affected larynx removed, which is called laryngectomy and get the voice prosthesis implanted,” said Dr Sunita Agarwal, head of the department (ENT), SMS hospital. With the advances, doctors claim that patients can have normal speech and swallowing as the voice of the patients can be preserved with latest prosthesis. Dr Agarwal says, it depends from case to case, which patients require chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or laryngectomy. But in order to preserve speech, some patients opt for chemotherapy and radiotherapy. At SMS hospital, over 200 patients have received prosthesis since 2000. Retired banker Verma, who need to keep changing his prosthesis on regular basis at SMS hospital, is raising his voice against tobacco consumption, but he has a grudge, that he cannot play mouth organ, which he loves a lot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/once-lost-his-speech-to-throat-cancer-now-retired-banker-raises-voice-against-tobacco-use/articleshow/84774521.cms||---

Though the situation was expected to worsen in the next 48 hours, due to slowdown in inflows to Almatti and Narayanapur reservoirs in the upstream, the inflows to Srisailam slowed down. The reservoir, which received 3,63,120 cusecs by 6 am on Monday, saw a considerable fall in inflows to 3,62,480 cusecs by evening. Despite incessant rains in the upstream, there was no floods in Sunkesula and Hundri rivulets which also bring inflows to Srisailam, besides Jurala. Srisailam reservoir is now full with water level standing at 871.60 feet against its capacity of 885 ft. Officials had sounded alerts in low-lying areas in the downstream of Srisailam reservoir, after Karnataka officials issued the first warning at Thungabhadra reservoir where the inflows were 1,82,622 cusecs in the last 24 hours. The water levels in Penna and Vamsadhara basins too were kept under constant observation. The Godavari is not in spate as the water level at Sir Arthur Cotton Barrage at Dowleswaram in Rajamahendravaram is under control, officials said. Though the island villages at Konaseema in East Godavari district heaved a sigh of relied after water levels started receding in Godavari, several villages in Devipatnma mandal of the district, and Polavaram and Velerupadu mandals in West Godavari are still surrounded by flood water. The backwaters of Polavaram project have also inundated many villages in the upstream area. Transportation is still cut off to about 30 villages in Chinturu, VR Puram, Koonavaram and Yetapaka mandals. The inflows to Sabari, a tributary of Godavari, has also slowed down. People living in sand dunes in Godavari have taken shelter in rehabilitation camps in the city. Irrigation authorities are discharging 7.93 lakh cusecs of water into the sea. As there have been no rains in the upstream areas of Godavari, officials are expecting a further dip in water level. At Konaseema, some low-lying areas in Ienavilli Lanka, Veeravalli Palem, Sanapalli Lanka, K Peda Lanka, Potti Lanka and Chintana Lanka villages under Ianavilli mandal are still surrounded by flood water. Several villages are cut off from the mainland as the road at G Pedapudi has got submerged near the border between East and West Godavari districts. West Godavari collector Karthikeya Misra visited flood-affected areas in Polavaram and Velerupadu mandals on Monday and interacted with people in Koida and Koruturu villages. He assured them all help from the district administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/situation-eases-as-inflows-slow-down/articleshow/84770698.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Shallot processing machines boon for farmers||COIMBATORE: To reduce dependence on labour and improve exportability, city-based ICAR—Central Institute of Agricultural Engineering has developed a grader to sort small onions into three sizes and a cleaner to reduce harvested onions of unwanted outer layers and make them ready to cook, cut or process immediately. ICAR-CIAE scientists, who have been working with onion farmers to understand their requirements, said many farmers complained of their produce, despite being of good quality, not qualifying for export because of the varied sizes and how people from industries were not approaching them, forcing them to sell to middlemen. “In late 2019, we decided to develop a machine that will grade onions, so that farmers can have uniformly-sized onions for sale. Uniformity in size is crucial for export,” a scientist said. One-and-a-half years later, the scientists came up with two machines. “The grader has holes of different sizes. Once they are thrown into the feeder, onions of different sizes will fall through the holes based on size, into respective containers,” said principal scientist Dawn P Ambrose, who demonstrated the machine to farmers on Saturday. It allows three sizes — small, medium and big. The cleaner will separate mud and dust from shallots when taken out of storage and clean them. While the cleaner would cost approximately Rs 25,000 to install, the grader would cost Rs 65,000. ICAR scientists, from both the Central Institute of Agricultural Engineering and the Indian Institute of Horticulture Bangalore, jointly conducted a training session for 75 farmers on Saturday showing machines including onion seed extractor, onion set planter, onion harvester and onion detopper. S Revathi, an onion farmer from Narasipuram, said that the onion detopper would reduce labour costs by 50%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/shallot-processing-machines-boon-for-farmers/articleshow/84774534.cms||---

Shastri said religious preachers and saints were feeling betrayed by the BJP, which has used them for taking political mileage. “There is no internal democracy in BJP. We are not free to raise issues of public interest in the party. BJP only uses saint samaj for coming to power and later puts pressure on them to get its political goal achieved. Religious preachers always dislike this,” Shastri said at a press conference organised at Sadaquat Ashram. Apart from Shastri, Saint Nikesh Choudhary, Dheeraj Pandey, Anjani Choudhary and their followers also joined the Congress. While addressing the media, Jha appreciated the efforts of his party in standing with the farmers and against the three farm laws. “We will fight for the rights of farmers till our last breath,” said Jha while appreciating the efforts of his party leader Rahul Gandhi and the tractor march taken out by him in the morning up to Parliament against the 2 contentious farm laws. CLP leader Sharma expressed anger over the detention of his party leaders Randeep Singh Surjewala and BV Shrinivasan and putting another leader Alka Lamba under house arrest.

The high court also directed APPCB to issue prior notices to the company before conducting tests. Amararaja had moved the high court challenging the closure notice issued by APPCB, which had alleged that the company had violated pollution control norms because of which excess amounts of pollutants were found in the vicinity. The APPCB finding also noted that the employees in the company were exposed to the pollution as they have found excess amount of lead in random blood samples. Arguing on behalf of APPCB, senior counsel C V Mohan Reddy said that the company was not cooperating with them to conduct necessary tests to find out the extent of damage caused to the environment as well as employees working in the company. He sought time to file a reply counter to the affidavit submitted by the company. Senior counsel B Adinarayana Rao argued for Amararaja and denied the allegations of non-cooperation by the company to conduct tests. He said that the APPCB officials have conducted inspections from July 21 to 24 and they are ready for any kind of tests. Considering the arguments on both sides, the high court bench, comprising Justice Joymalya Bagchi and Justice K Suresh Reddy, issued directions to both the parties and asked APPCB to submit inspection and test reports to the court.

A council meeting held recently had approved meeting this expense from the plan fund. While STP at Muttathara drains nearly 10 crore annually from corporation, the plant is yet to process sewage to its full capacity, eight years after becoming operational. The Thiruvananthapuram Sewerage Scheme (TSS) area has been divided into seven blocks –– A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Among these, sewerage facility is available fully in A and B and partially in C, D and E. No engineering design has been prepared for blocks F and G covering the coastal areas. The new pumping stations are proposed to enhance the supply of sewage to the treatment plant. In 2013, though the processing level at the plant was estimated at 30%, it could increase up to 75% once all 11 stations were commissioned. The present network covers only 20.2% of corporation area. An elaborate plan was conceived under AMRUT scheme to broaden the sewerage network in the city, however the work has cost corporation dearly even before it has started. The AMRUT scheme cost has gone up considerably due to difficulties in its execution. The state government had recently approved the tender excess of three sub-works at 31.5%, 43% and 24.05% thus pushing the cost up from Rs 29.94 crore to Rs 32.7 crores. Half of this excess cost should be borne by the corporation. The works include sewer network from Pettah-Arasumoodu Junction to Edathara pumping station, laying sewer network in Edathara and laying transmission main and sewer network in Edathara, collection and conveyance system and another sewer network at Anayara. KWA had reported that the three works were tendered thrice and high quotes were received in the first two tenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sewage-treatment-efforts-continue-to-drain-city-corp/articleshow/84771830.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Patna||Patna: NDA legislators asked to remain in House during business hours||PATNA: The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) legislators have been asked to remain present in their respective legislative Houses during the entire business hours of the ongoing monsoon session and ensure smooth passage of different bills to be tabled by the state government in the current session. Bihar legislature’s five-day monsoon session began on Monday. The state government has planned to table at least six Bills. Three of them are related to establishment of three new universities in the state. Addressing a crucial meeting of the NDA legislators convened on Monday to discuss the floor management strategies for the monsoon session, senior NDA leaders reminded them of the ruling alliance’s thin majority in the legislative assembly and said it would be difficult for the government to get its bills passed smoothly if even a few of them skip the proceedings. The NDA in Bihar has four constituents — BJP, JD(U), HAM(S) and VIP. Its current strength in the assembly is 125, just four more than the majority mark of 121, as two seats in the 243-member assembly are currently vacant following the death of two MLAs. Of the 125 NDA MLAs, 74 are from the BJP and 43 from JD(U) while Ham(S) and VIP have 4 MLAs each. Independent MLA Sumit Kumar Singh is also part of the government. However, the 4 VIP MLAs and its chief Mukesh Sahani, MLC, didn’t attend the meeting held at the assembly’s central hall. CM Nitish Kumar, deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi and some other senior leaders of the BJP and JD(U) addressed the meeting. Some of the NDA MLAs, sources said, also voiced their protest over leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s demand that CM Nitish Kumar should tender an apology for alleged assault on the opposition’s MLAs in the assembly during the budget session on March 23. “Any happening inside the assembly comes under the jurisdiction of the Vidhan Sabha Speaker, who is already looking into the matter. The CM should not tender an apology in this matter, at any cost. Instead, the Speaker should take necessary action against the opposition MLAs, who created bedlam in the House during the budget session,” the NDA MLAs argued. The CM asked the legislators to keep an eye on the ongoing development works in their areas and report to appropriate authorities if they found any discrepancies in the execution of the government schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nda-legislators-asked-to-remain-in-house-during-business-hours/articleshow/84768155.cms||Madan Kumar

All the big hospitals like Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) and Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) are getting a large number of patients suffering from such diseases though the number of Covid and mucormycosis patients has dropped remarkably. In fact, the PMCH on Monday created a 12-bed dengue ward as a precautionary measure. “There are no patients of Covid and mucormycosis at the hospital at present. However, the number of high fever, typhoid and diarrhoea patients has increased. As accumulation of water offers a favourable breeding ground to mosquitoes, it causes various ailments, including dengue,” PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur said. IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal too said several viral fever and diarrhoea patients visit the hospital on a daily basis. “Weather casts a big impact on our health. Several microorganisms and insects find the monsoon favourable to grow and infect human beings,” Dr Mandal added. “Of the total patients reaching the OPD of AIIMS-P medicine department these days, about 40% show symptoms of typhoid, dengue, malaria and acute gastroenteritis,” said Dr Vijay Kumar of the hospital’s medicine department. Cases of fungal infection on skin and high viral fever with cough and cold are also on the rise, he added. “People should consume freshly-cooked food, clear all small accumulations of water in discarded utensils, used tyres, earthen flowerpots on rooftops and open spaces to check mosquitoes from finding breeding spaces,” Dr Vijay added. Acting president of the Indian Medical Association-Bihar, Dr Ajay Kumar, said typhoid, dengue and viral fever cases were being detected in large number in rural areas near Maner too. Dr Satish Kumar of NMCH said 30% of about 400 patients visiting the medicine OPD in a day were being diagnosed with acute viral fever, malaria, diarrhoea, food poisoning and typhoid and few cases of dengue were also detected. “Personal hygiene, consumption of hot food and pure water and cleanliness around homes are the basic tips to keep these diseases at bay,” he added. Dr Kumar said people should also strictly adhere to the Covid protocols and continue to use masks. “We have also received several calls from Bhagalpur, Siwan, Sitamarhi, Madhepura and rural Patna for suggestion through telemedicine on high fever, sneezing and cough. The memories of immense human sufferings during the second wave of Covid pandemic are still fresh in the minds of the people. On developing high fever and cough, they run for RT-PCR test. After being tested negative, they seek suggestion from doctors on the line of medication,” said Dr Anil Kumar, head of the telemedicine unit of AIIMS P. Dr Manjula Rani of Government Hospital, Gardanibagh, said seasonal flu, fever and typhoid symptoms were being noticed in many patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/monsoon-diseases-keep-hospitals-on-toes/articleshow/84767179.cms||VK Tripathi

This weekly-unpaid overtime — 11 hours additional unpaid work each week compared to eight hours extra weekly prior to the pandemic — is the highest among their counterparts globally as per estimates made by global HR consulting firm ADP in their survey of over 32,000 workers across 17 countries. In the US and China, employees are clocking up an additional nine hours of unpaid work each week, while in the UK and Australia they are putting in an extra seven hours on average. Globally, the average amount of “free overtime being worked each week” is now 9.2 hours per person – up from 7.3 hours pre-pandemic, the survey said.Globally, those working from home estimate they are putting in more unpaid overtime than those based in the workplace or on-site, at 9.4 hours per week on average, compared to 8.7 hours.Due to the pandemic and the extra hours worked, over 85% of Indian employees feel they have been compromising between their work, health and family. However, despite the additional workload, in India, 58% said that they want to continue working from home, primarily due to health concerns around getting back to workspaces. Rahul Goyal, managin director (MD, India & South East Asia, ADP, said workers are now routinely clocking up what looks to be “more than a working day’s-worth” of additional hours weekly. “These findings reject the idea [that] some employers had that working from home is an excuse to relax — far from it. Having been forced into this remote working experiment and seen how much effort staff members are putting in, businesses may be more likely to allow greater flexibility around working structures to continue going forward,” he said. The additional hours are a combination of essential workers struggling to keep up with the extra workload resulting from Covid-19 and non-essential workers (front line) going the extra mile due to concerns about job security or because the boundaries between work and home life have been blurred when working remotely, he added. ADP noted in its survey that solving the issue requires a major cultural shift within companies to change attitudes towards overwork, starting with a commitment from top management. While companies are aware that employees are putting in extra hours and they do appreciate these extra efforts by the employees, there is no mechanism to track and reward staff for extra hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wfh-at-11-hrs/week-desis-do-most-overtime-globally/articleshow/84771919.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Deputy Inspector general of police \SSP (Prayagraj) Sarvashreshth Tripathi on Monday launched the service and attended to the first video call complaint. SSP told TOI, “This video call facility will help people sitting abroad as well as senior citizens, sick people and women living alone in their homes to register their complaint to senior police officials and cops who would make sincere efforts to get the complaints disposed of promptly." He further said that the facility will also be convenient for people during the Covid-19 pandemic as many people do not want to visit the police stations. According to officials, people who need to report a complaint can send them on the WhatsApp number 9984781881 or make a video call to senior cops between 12 noon to 2pm daily. On the first day, the senior cops attended as many as 72 video calls. SSP, meanwhile, assured that they would make other arrangements so that pending calls should also be addressed. The complaints attended by the senior cops will be forwarded to the respective stations for further action and investigation. A senior cop said, "There are many incidences when people sitting abroad or other states could not come to register their complaints during the Covid pandemic and want to get their problems solved. Through this facility, we would be connecting with people and this exercise will also help to bridge the communication gap between the people and police," he added. He also claimed that the "technology revolution has undoubtedly helped us all to connect with people and cops, with the police making efforts to win the confidence of citizens."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/in-a-first-prayagraj-police-launches-video-call-complaint-facility/articleshow/84769943.cms||Kapil Dixit

While the ruling YSRCP is trying to approve key bills related to the implementation of the capital value system for property tax collection, opposition parties are planning huge protests to stall the council meeting. The VMC wants to implement tax reforms under GO. 198. The property taxes which are calculated based on the annual rental value of the property till date will be calculated as per the Capital value (market value) with the council resolution. The VMC council meeting held on July 15 discussed key issues and decided to take up the discussion on the collection July 19. But the scheduled council meeting was postponed after CPM corporator B Satya Babu wrote a letter to the mayor. The VMC gave a notification for a special council meeting on July 28 and detailed discussion on tax reforms. TDP and CPM have decided to object to the bill in council meetings. Jana Sena and CPI had extended their support to the protests at the VMC office on Tuesday. “YSRC has betrayed people by assuring them they would not add to tax burden. They have added garbage tax in the name of service charge and capital value system of property tax collection. This will add 15% tax burden,” said Ch Babu Rao, CPM state secretariat member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tax-reforms-may-dominate-vmc-meet-tomorrow/articleshow/84771331.cms||Venu Lanka

PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur said the laparoscopy instruments have already been installed in the surgery department of the hospital. “Without making large incisions on the skin, this surgical diagnostic procedure is very helpful in removing gall bladder, appendix and hernia from the abdominal region. Since large number of patients from across the state reach PMCH for ailments requiring open surgery, the laparoscopy method will help them,” Dr Thakur said. Meanwhile, the PMCH has also made about 5,000 iron tablets available for children suffering from thalassaemia and undergoing treatment in paediatrics unit of the hospital. Dr Thakur said following directions issued by health minister Mangal Pandey and Bihar Medical Services Infrastructure Corporation Limited (BMSICL), these medicines were purchased in the interest of patients. He added children suffering from thalassaemia were being treated through blood transfusion and medication. The issue of non-availability of lift facility for thalassaemia patients was brought to the notice of chief minister Nitish Kumar at his recent ‘janata darbar’ programme recently. Dr Thakur said the hospital administration has urged the BMSICL to ensure repair of the lift at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/laparoscopic-surgery-to-begin-at-pmch-soon/articleshow/84769178.cms||---

---||Patna||People observe fast, perform puja at home on 1st Somvari||PATNA: Clad in traditional clothes, hundreds of devotees worshipped Lord Shiva at home on the first Somvari of Shravan. A large number of them even flocked to temples, which are shut for devotees due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and performed the rituals at the entrance gates. According to the Hindu calendar, people offer ‘patram’, ‘pushpam’, ‘phalam’, and ‘thoyam’ to Lord Shiva during the holy and auspicious month of Shravan. They also observe fast on Mondays. A Lord Shiva devotee, Anjali Anand, woke up early on Monday morning to make preparations for the first Somvari of Shravan. “We performed ‘rudrabhishek’ in our house and offered ‘Ganga jal’, milk, bael leaves, flowers and ‘vibhuti’ to Lord Shiva. We also observed fast and ate fruits,” the Raja Bazar resident told this newspaper. A resident of Kadamkuan, Reshma Karla, has decided to observe fast on 16 Mondays this year. She said, “Observing fast during Shravan has scientific benefits too.” Reshma, who ate fruits throughout the day, believes that Lord Shiva fulfils all the wishes and desires of his devotees. She has been performing Shravan rituals since a young age. Another devotee, Harshit Kumar, did not visit any Shiva temple on Monday. He had been making preparations for the day since last week by cleaning his house and buying puja materials. “Being a true devotee of Lord Shiva, I believe that worshipping him can eliminate all troubles,” he claimed. Temples wear deserted look: The Shiva temples in Bagaha wore a deserted look as devotees were not allowed to perform Somvari rituals there. Their gates remained closed for outsiders. Only the priests were seen performing puja inside the temples. Meanwhile, a priest at the Hariharnath Temple in Sonepur, Bumbum Baba, said, “All that matters is faith. Even if devotees could not enter the temple due to Covid-19, they performed Somvari rituals at its entrance. We, on the other hand, performed the ‘sandhya aarti’.” He added, “I believe that even if people cannot enter the temple, their prayers will not go unanswered.” (With inputs from Tirthraj Kushwah in Bagaha)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/people-observe-fast-perform-puja-at-home-on-1st-somvari/articleshow/84767692.cms||---

The association has also demanded introduction of bus services between Bodh Gaya and tourist destinations like Rajgir, Nalanda, Dhungeshwari, Vanavar and Gurpa. Association president Rakesh Kumar met the state tourism minister Narayan Prasad during his Bodh Gaya visit on Sunday. “The tourist information centre in Bodh Gaya is at a distance of about 1km from the Mahabodhi temple. It should be located around the Mahavihara near the office of Bodh Gaya Temple Management Committee so that tourists can easily get information about other nearby sites and modes of communication. The centre should provide information about flights, trains, buses and foreign exchange,” Rakesh said. He added, “Bus service is also not available for the tourists keen to visit places like Dhungeshwari, Gurpa, Rajgir and Nalanda. To visit Dhungeshwari, Vanavar and Gurpa, tourists have to hire commercial vehicles, which is very expensive. For Rajgir and Nalanda, bus service is needed for the tourists.” Meanwhile, the minister told mediapersons that the state government would soon take a decision on whether to hold the fortnight-long Pitripaksh mela this year or not. Pitripaksh is beginning from September 19 and there is uncertainty over organizing the event.

As many as 865 RBKs have been planned for Guntur district, out of which works on 584 have begun. The district administration completed RBK buildings in 127 locations last fortnight while the remaining buildings are getting ready for the launch. With district collector Vivek Yadav monitoring the progress of the RBK works, the agriculture department is rushing through deadlines to bring all centres into operations shortly. “Covid-19 crisis delayed some works. Otherwise, we could have launched more centres by this kharif season,” said a senior official in the agriculture department. Meanwhile, the collector has asked the officials to take up regular training and awareness programmes for farmers at the RBKs. Special campaign activities are also being taken up about seasonal viruses on the crops and best agriculture practices through RBKs.

The delay in distribution, allegedly due to server glitches, has led to long queues outside ration depots. The state government supplies ration to beneficiaries by the second week of every month through door-to-door ration supply vehicles. The supply of free ration sanctioned by the Union government was taken up from the third week of the month from May 2020. With delay in supply through door-to-door vehicles, the civil supplies authorities have decided to supply ration at the depots by taking biometrics of the benificeries with E-POS machines. But poor servers and technical glitches have become a big concern this month. “My husband lost his job due to Covid-19 economic crisis and we are dependent on essentials supplied by the government through free ration. I came to the ration depot at 9 am and waited for almost four hours. Only 20 people were able to receive ration and we were asked to come again in the evening,” said Esther Rani, a resident of Christuraja Puram. Ration dealers say that they are able to supply ration to only 70 beneficiaries per day due to faulty servers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/server-trouble-slows-down-ration-scheme/articleshow/84771485.cms||Venu Lanka

Under the leadership of Guenter Butschek, whose tenure ends this month, Tata Motors juggled to grow market share in a business environment blighted by the pandemic, while trying to keep a lid on costs. Tata Motors’s loss narrowed to Rs 4,450 crore in its first quarter ending June 30, down over 47% from Rs 8,444 crore in the year-ago period. Revenue more than doubled to Rs 65,535 crore as vehicle demand improved in key markets like China, Europe and the US. However, raw material costs zoomed 275% to Rs 37,312 crore in Q1FY22 because of semiconductor supply shortages and commodity inflation. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), which accounted for 79% of Tata Motors’s revenue, made an operational loss of Rs 233 crore, but down from Rs 3,495 crore a year earlier. The British arm’s earnings are crucial for Tata Motors and the broader Tata Group after mobility restrictions triggered by the public health crisis crimped demand for some of the conglomerate’s businesses like hospitality. JLR warned of worsening semiconductor supply shortages in this quarter than in the first one. This could lower wholesale volumes by 50% from what was planned earlier. The chip crisis had forced JLR to temporarily suspend production at a couple of its plants in the UK. It is also pivoting to fully electric models by the end of this decade to get ahead of looming bans on new fossil-fuel vehicles in many countries (in the UK, the ban will take place in 2030). There are challenges but revenue, market share and profitability are trending in the right direction, said CFO P B Balaji. “It is a matter of time and of external circumstances to favour us. We are as eager as you to see the company deliver,” he said. The Tata Motors management also said the process of transferring the domestic passenger vehicle business to a separate company is in the last stage. The hearing at the NCLT was concluded on July 1 and the final order is awaited, it said. While people, intellectual property rights and other assets related to the passenger vehicle business will be part of the new subsidiary, Tata Motors will retain the debt of the division on its books.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-motors-nearly-halves-april-june-loss-to-rs-4-5k-cr/articleshow/84773457.cms||---

The cut points or intersection points on the BRTS here, have turned into accident points as vehicles move in the two lanes on both the sides of the corridor at high speed and when vehicles try to cross through the cut points, accidents happen. As per the data compiled by traffic police, 131 accidents, highest in the city, took place in Misrod last year in which 14 people lost their lives while 69 were injured. This year, seven fatal accidents have already been reported on the stretch of Hoshangabad Road passing through Misrod, including the latest car-truck accident, in which more than 10 people lost their lives and around the same number of people were injured. One third of the width of the stretch on Hoshangabad Road from RRL trisection in Bag Sewania till Misrod is covered by the BRTS corridor. Two narrow lanes on both sides of the road are left for vehicles to pass and the rest of the road is covered by ‘bicycle track’ and service roads. The intersections of the BRTS are located near Misrod police station, in front of Saklecha Hospital, in front of Surendra Landmark, at Danish Nagar, Vidhya Nagar or Bag Sewania police station, BU Gate and RRL Trisection. SHO Misrod Niranjan Sharma admitted that the main cause of road accidents on this stretch are the intesections points of BRTS corridor. In the peak hours in morning and evening, traffic jam takes place if any vehicles tries to enter through these cut points into the main lane. Condition of traffic at Danish Nagar Square cut point remains the worst during evening hours. Sharma said that people often drive in the wrong lane in the service roads to avoid taking a longer route to reach the BRTS cut points and cause traffic congestion at intersections. He said, apart from the BRTS stretch, Gyarah Meel Square area and Samardha have also accident-prone zones in Misrod. Apart from that, dumpers which run unhindered on roads at night are also a major cause of concern, said SHO Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/rash-driving-brts-cuts-cause-of-concern-in-misrod/articleshow/84774571.cms||Sudeept Mishra
---||Amaravati||Vijayawada job exchange goes online, others to follow||AMARAVATI: The state government has decided to upgrade all existing employment exchanges into digital exchanges to bring more opportunities to the unemployed youth. After successfully completing the digitalisation of old records in the Vijayawada exchange, the authorities are planning to expand the services to all other districts with more facilities. According to official sources in the department of employment and training, the employment exchanges in the state are utilising the offline Arundhathi software developed in 1993 by AP Technology Society (APTS). The existing offline package is being upgraded into a new portal with backend technology. The authorities of APTS are developing an integrated web application to migrate and convert the old data in the portal as per functional scope of the department. The pilot project implemented in Vijayawada has been successfully completed, paving the way for its expansion. The graduate youth have almost stopped enrolling in the employment exchanges as they were getting more opportunities from the private sector than government agencies. Sources said the government is of the view that the digitalisation would help the government connect with the private market to create more job opportunities. Sources said that the government has decided to implement the digitalisation project in employment exchanges in two phases. In the first phase, all activities of employment exchanges in Arundhathi package will be extracted /converted and migrated to the new portal. It will be integrated with the National Career Service (NCC) portal. Sources said moving to the digitalisation of employment exchanges would not only help unemployed youth from getting timely alerts about offers available in the market, it will also help employers pick up candidates from the available pool. Moreover, digitalisation would help manage records in a tamper-proof manner. “The government is offering weightage to some candidates in different job recruitment examinations. In all such cases, making enrolment in employment exchange mandatory and taking records from the department will make the operations transparent particularly with regard to the seniority of the candidates in the waiting list,” said another official. Similarly, all employment activities will be offered to job seekers as well as employers through the public domain and village and ward secretariats. The government is also contemplating encouraging sponsors to conduct job fairs. “We are planning to conduct job melas at least twice a month in each district. All those enrolled in the digital employment exchanges will receive alerts,” said a senior official. In phase-II, the department is planning to go for integration of the exchanges with other departments including industries, APSSDC, SEEDAP, educational institutions and training providers. The department of employment and training is also planning to rope in different expert agencies to conduct career counseling and vocational guidance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/vij-job-exchange-goes-online-others-to-follow/articleshow/84782341.cms||Samdani MN

Ambati Pola Raju, a petty trader, and his brother-in-law Thanbala Srinu found some gold coins while travelling in an RTC bus. Pola Raju realised that a passenger in a front seat of the bus might have misplaced the gold. He visited the RTC Complex in the city but when he failed to find him, Pola Raju and Srinu went to PM Palem police station. DCP (crimes) V Suresh Babu said that P Durga Rao, a goldsmith and a resident of Marikavalasa, had collected 454 grams of gold from five jewellery shops, put them in a bag and boarded the bus. He got down at Marikavalasa. A few minutes later, he realised he had left behind some of the gold on the bus. He immediately alerted the police by dialing 100 and later went to PM Palem police station. While Durga Rao was talking to the policemen, Pola Raju and Srinu reached the place. “I decided to hand over the gold to the police so that they can locate the rightful owner,” said Pola Raju.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/two-samaritans-return-gold-worth-rs-27l-to-owner/articleshow/84771390.cms||Nalla.Babu

Sahani, who is angry with Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath for preventing him from taking part in former MP late Phoolan Devi’s statue installation function at Varanasi on Sunday, however, affirmed that the NDA government in the state will complete its full term. In response to a query, he quipped, “Should I resign from the government to help those who stabbed me in the back and subsequently throw the state in a quagmire giving room for a fresh election?” Sahani’s reactions came a couple of hours after his party preferred to abstain from the NDA legislature party meeting held under the chairmanship of CM Nitish on the assembly premises on the first day of the monsoon session. When asked about the reason behind his abstaining from the legislature party meeting, the VIP chief said, “It’s true that the other constituents of the ruling NDA in the state are not getting due respect. Nobody is ready to listen to us, which is not a good sign.” Elaborating further, the minister said there was no point to attend a meeting when the grievances of other allies were not being redressed. He, however, hastened to add that there should be a right platform to discuss such issues within the NDA. Describing the UP government’s move as “undemocratic”, the minister said, “I was detained at the airport, while my supporters were confined to a hotel by the Varanasi police. If such a precedence is set, it would be difficult for the leaders to enter the limits of other states to attend functions. I hope the top BJP leadership will think over it.” In the same vein, Sahani added that it was also against PM Narendra Modi’s principle of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas and sabka vishwas’. He, however, said the Sunday's incident proved that the VIP’s presence had been felt in UP ahead of the assembly polls there. Earlier, HAM(S) chief and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi supported the VIP chief and said, “What happened with Mukesh Sahani in Uttar Pradesh can’t be held right.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sahani-angry-with-yogi-govt-but-says-nda-intact-in-bihar/articleshow/84768123.cms||Ramashankar
---||Madurai||Madurai Corporation to revive two more waterbodies in city||MADURAI: The Madurai Corporation in association with a few private companies and Dhan Foundation, an NGO, has taken up the work on restoring two more waterbodies to augment the underground water table in the city limits. Vallanathapuram tank measuring 1.5 acres and Kannimar Tankmeasuring around 0.5 acre will be revived soon. Hi Tech Arai and HCL Foundation have come forward to join the revival process. Kannimar tank is located close to a thick residential area at Villapuram. The waterbody lost its shape several years ago and is mostly being used for dumping garbage. Madurai Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan and the officials from Dhan Foundation visited various tanks including Vallanathapuram tank and Kannimar tank recently. The commissioner told TOI that he had instructed the officials to provide full cooperation in bringing the tanks to life, the work on which will commence soon, he said. Residents of Villapuram said that the tank was completely silted over the years and many could not even recognize that a tank existed there. A section of residents used to dump a large quantity of garbage in the tank. Though the civic body officials turned a blind eye towards it, they cleaned the place a day before the commissioner’s visit. Around ten tractor loads of garbage were removed from it, they said. K P Karthikeyan said that an artificial island will be created in the middle of the Vallanathapuram tank and fruit bearing trees would be planted. It would attract birds, which cannot be disturbed by people. Lokesh Sinram, an environmental engineer from Dhan Foundation, said that initially, ten tanks were identified by Hi Tech Arai for revival. Out of them, work in seven tanks have been completed. Work on the three tanks could not be taken up so far as they hold water. He said that all the works were taken up by involving the local residents in the project to give them a sense of responsibility. They are being involved in order to create a sustainable model for the protection of the tank. “Work has been carried out without affecting the ecology of the waterbodies. We have avoided use of concrete and paver blocks to the maximum extent. Walking tracks were provided using stone blocks. Once the projects are completed the waterbodies can help store stormwater and improve the groundwater table,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-to-revive-two-more-waterbodies-in-city/articleshow/84774562.cms||V Devanathan

In a notice to the stock exchange, the Kerala-based bank said that the board approved the decision in its meeting on July 23. The board approved the allotment of 10.5 crore shares of face value Rs 2 to the IFC Group at an issue price of Rs 87.4. With this allotment, the paid-up capital of the bank has risen from 199.6 crore shares to 210.1 crore of Rs 2 each.

As of end June 2021, mutual funds held 35.6% in the bank followed by foreign investors (24%) and insurance companies (10.8%). Individual shareholders and others held the remaining 29.3%. The investment from IFC comes at a time when the bank’s CEO Shyam Srinivasan received RBI’s approval for a three-year extension. “We believe the 3-year extension of the term of MD & CEO should provide strategic continuity.

On a consolidated basis, the net profit was 2.5% down at Rs 1,806 crore compared to Rs 1,853 crore from previous year. The increase in standalone profit was driven by a higher net interest income, which rose to Rs 3,942 crore from Rs 3,724 crore in the previous year. The bank said that the consolidated net profit was down because of a net loss of Rs 243 crore by Kotak Life Insurance. “The second wave of Covid has resulted in Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance receiving a significant number of death claims in Q1FY22. The increased claims reported, and extra mortality-related provisioning, has resulted in a net loss on shareholders’ account,” the bank said. Total assets managed/advised by the group as on June 30, 2021 was Rs 3,43,708 crore — up 32% over Rs 2,59,781 crore as on June 30, 2020.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Farmers in Krishna delta turn to natural methods for better yield||VIJAYAWADA: Natural farming is becoming a trend in Krishna district. Many farmers, who are practising modern farming techniques and achieving high yield, have shifted their focus to natural farming with a huge demand and price in the market. The Krishna delta is considered as the rice bowl of Andhra Pradesh. Paddy cultivation is predominant across the district and farmers are getting up to 45 bags of yield every season. But still many farmers have started organic and natural farming this season. M Raghunandan, a farmer from Komatigunta Laku village, said, “We ran behind yield and destroyed our soil by using chemicals. The cost of production has increased but MSP didn’t increase as per expenditure. We are investing around Rs 30,000 per acre and earning Rs 40,000. There is no benefit with high yield. Instead we have decided to go for natural farming which gives half of the yield with Rs 8,000 investment per acre.” The majority of farmers in the district are selling their produce to the government as there is no demand in the open market. “We are selling the crops to the government and waiting for months to get money. No miller or trader is coming forward to buy from us directly. But organic and naturally grown paddy has high demand. Old variety paddy cultivated and harvested through natural farming techniques is getting Rs 2,675 per a bag of 75 kilogram in market,” said Bandi Rambabu, a farmer from Thotlavalluru, said. Many corporate companies retailing organic products are approaching the farmers and Farmers Producers Organisations (FPO) and investing in cultivation. A few organisations have also started online classes on natural farming.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/farmers-in-krishna-delta-turn-to-natural-methods-for-better-yield/articleshow/84771274.cms||Venu Lanka

CarTrade, a multichannel auto marketplace, said it has received the regulatory nod for its offer. According to merchant banking sources the Rs 2,000-crore IPO is expected to be launched in the first week of August. The company had filed the offer document on May 15 this year. Through the offer, some of CarTrade’s existing shareholders, which include marquee investors like Warburg Pincus, Temasek and JP Morgan, are selling a little over 1.2 crore shares. Unlike Zomato that is still a loss-making venture, CarTrade has turned profitable in fiscal 2019, a release from the company said. The company is not raising any money through the IPO. CarTrade runs several consumer-facing and other auto channels that include CarWale, CarTrade, Shriram Automall, BikeWale, CarTrade Exchange, Adroit Auto and Auto Biz. The company’s “platforms offer a variety of data-driven solutions across automotive transaction value chain for marketing, buying, selling and financing of new and pre-owned cars, two-wheelers as well as pre-owned commercial vehicles and farm & construction equipment”, the release said.

The police presence ensured that none stood in queue without a valid coupon, which were issued by the KMC health department to prevent chaos that the mega centres had been seeing over the last few weeks. Over 6,000 received their shots at these mega centres without hassle. According to a KMC health department official, over 60% of vaccines allocated for the mega centres were given to recipients of the first dose, particularly those in the 18-44 age group. Dwip Majhi, a college student from Panchannagram, took the jab at the mega centre at Elite Cinema. “I had been trying to get a jab from a government-run centre for the past three weeks. A friend advised me to get a coupon from the KMC mega centre at Elite and now I feel relaxed,” Majhi said. TimesViewCitizens are desperately waiting for a normal supply of vaccines. There has been too much uncertainty and waste of time because of supply-line problems. Government agencies in charge of overseeing the release of vaccines must also keep in mind that extra-long queues and waiting time expose vaccine recipients to the virus.Since there is no bar on recipients from other districts at mega vaccination centres, they are witnessing a surge in the number of recipients from outside. For instance, the mega centre at Ahindra Mancha on Monday administered 1,500 shots, of which a considerable number was given to people from adjoining districts. “I was down with Covid and so could not take the vaccine for three months. Finally, I booked my first dose at the KMC mega centre at Bhawanipur Education Society on Co-Win. The process was smooth and it was over in just 15 minutes,” said Nisha Mundra, 25, a Howrah resident studying CA. According to a KMC official, considering the ever-increasing demand, the civic brass has requested the state health department to augment vaccine supply as fast as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/coupon-system-smoothens-ops-at-kmc-mega-centres/articleshow/84771999.cms||Saikat Ray

Crime branch and Kondhwa police officers found youngsters partying at the two clubs under the influence of liquor, in violation of the prevailing Covid-19 restrictions. The TOI team visited the two clubs on Monday, but their premises were locked. Call and messages to the club operators did not yield any reply. Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Shrinivas Ghadge said, “Senior inspector Shilpa Chavan and her team acted on a tip-off and raided the club in Kondhwa where they found people being served hookah and pipes.” Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Namrata Patil said the Kondhwa police team raided the other club where a poolside party was going on. “There were 30-40 patrons on the club premises. They all were dancing and enjoying their drinks,” she said. A 65-year-old resident of a housing society close to the Undri club, said, “Covid or no Covid, but these facilities remain to be a nuisance. They continue to operate well beyond the deadline. Forget the loud music, the worst part is revellers creating a ruckus after partying. It seems that police patrolling is just an eyewash.” The cases have been registered under Section 188 (disobedience to order), and other relevant sections of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-bust-illegal-parties-at-2-clubs-in-midnight-raids-in-undri-kondhwa/articleshow/84774526.cms||Gitesh Shelke

---||Patna||India generated 56K tonnes of Covid bio-medical waste in a yr||Bengaluru: India generated 56,898 tonnes of Covid-19-related biomedical waste between June 2020-21, an indication of the magnitude of the pandemic. Data from the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change shows Maharashtra generated the maximum at 8,317 tonnes, followed by Kerala (6,442), Gujarat (5,004), Tamil Nadu (4,835), Delhi (3,995), Uttar Pradesh (3,881) and Karnataka (3,133). Experts say the lack of total correlation between infections and the waste burden only shows that the data is at odds with the ground situation. To track Covid-19 biomedical waste (BMW) and ensure safe disposal, the ministry had developed an app called Covid BMW. As of May, there were 198 common BMW treatment and disposal facilities in the country. Maharashtra had the highest at 29 while Karnataka had 26. Data with the central pollution control board shows peak generation of about 250 tonnes per day (TPD) was reported on May 10, when the second wave was at its peak in multiple states. The peak generation last year was in the range of 180–220 TPD. Aparajita Chattopadhyay, professor, department of developmental studies, International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai, who co-authored a study on Covid-19 biomedical waste burden of different states, said the pandemic has only exposed the BMW handling scenario in India. Chattopadhyay pointed out there is no clarity on the end point of biomedical waste generated by people in home isolation. “What happens to disposable masks used by people? What is the ideal way of disposal? These are not clearly stated by the government. In reality, this waste is mixed with municipal waste,” she said, adding that the need is to forge public-private partnerships to establish biomedical waste processing units across the country. Dr Girdhar Gyani, director general, Association of Healthcare Providers in India (AHPI), echoed similar concerns and added that there is no uniformity in waste processing charges across the country. DK Nagaraj, president, Karnataka Hospital Waste Disposal Facility Operators’ Association, said during the peak of the second wave, Bengaluru alone generated 5-6 tonnes of Covid-19 BMW per day. “Now, since cases have reduced, it has fallen to less than 2 tonnes per day in Karnataka,” said Nagaraj. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) constitutes a major portion of the waste. Early in the pandemic, even food waste generated by a Covid-19 patient was treated as biomedical waste and incinerated. “Disposable cutlery, pillows and bed covers were considered Covid-19 biomedical waste till September 2020,” said Dr HM Prasanna, president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, Karnataka. “It used to be 3kg per patient in June 2020 but now it is around 1.2kg a day per patient.” Now, only PPE, masks, gloves, cotton swabs, shoe covers, needles, syringes and IV fluid bottles are considered Covid-19 BMW.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/india-generated-56k-tonnes-of-covid-bio-medical-waste-in-a-yr/articleshow/84768465.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Vijayawada||Former Union minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju moves Andhra Pradesh HC, seeks to suspend GO 75||VIJAYAWADA: Former Union minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju moved the Andhra Pradesh high court seeking directions to suspend GO 75 issued by the state government constituting Mansas Trust Board. He also sought directions to the executive officer (EO) of the trust to follow his directions as he is the chairman of the trust. Senior counsel D V Sitarama Murthy and advocate N Ashwani Kumar argued on behalf of Ashok Raju. They stated that the high court had set aside GO 74 issued by the state government appointing Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju as chairman of the Mansas Trust by recognising her as founder family member. They argued that GO 75 cannot stand the test of law as it was a consequential order to GO 74 that has been set aside by the high court. As the EO is still acting according to GO 75 and not following Ashok’s orders in the capacity of chairman of the trust, they sought directions to set aside GO 75 also which has become infructous after GO 74 was set aside. The counsel for endowments department sought time to obtain instructions from the government and told the high court the additional advocate general will argue the matter. Considering his request, Justice M Venkataramana posted the matter for Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/former-min-moves-high-court-seeks-to-suspend-go-75/articleshow/84770772.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Significantly, it is routing the investment through its 100% local arm SATS Food Solutions India and not through its existing joint venture, Taj SATS, in which it holds 49% stake. SATS will be investing Rs 200 crore to set up a kitchen in Bengaluru airport which, according to the company, is its “first major investment” in India. Aside from Taj SATS, where Tata Group holds 51% in the in-flight meal caterer, the Singaporean company has equity interest in ground handler Air India SATS, where it hold equal stakes with the national carrier. The Bengaluru airport kitchen, which will dish out 1.7 lakh ready-to-eat meals a day, will be operational next year. While this will add to its network of kitchens in India, it will also use this facility as an export hub “to take authentic Indian cuisine overseas”. The in-flight meal catering business has been impacted by the public health crisis as many passengers, especially on short flights, still prefer to remain firmly masked up and opt not to eat onboard. But players have ventured into other areas like home delivery of meals. Earlier this year, SkyGourmet, one of India’s biggest flight caterers, shut its kitchens in Delhi and Mumbai airports, rendering hundreds of people jobless. Through the new kitchen in Bengaluru airport, SATS will create 300 jobs. Earlier, the Bengaluru kitchen, which will cater to the non-airline segment, was to be set up by Taj SATS. The latest development indicates that SATS has decided to go solo for the facility. “The pandemic and the new normal of working from home has heavily influenced consumer preference for innovative and hygienic food and SATS’s central kitchen (in Bengaluru airport) will cater to these evolving needs of the Indian consumers,” said SATS Food Solutions India CEO Sagar Dighe. Singapore and Tata Group have a long relationship, with the former also a partner in Tata’s airline venture Vistara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/in-flight-caterer-sats-eyes-rs-200cr-solo-project/articleshow/84773380.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The government, HUDCO’s main promoter, has mandated merchant bankers to sell up to 16 crore shares at a floor (minimum) price of Rs 45 per share. On Monday, HUDCO shares on the BSE closed at Rs 47, down 7% on the day since marketmen were expecting supply of shares from the government. The part of OFS under which institutional investors could bid for HUDCO shares will open on Tuesday, while retail investors are allowed to bid only on Wednesday, the closing day of the issue. The OFS is divided into two parts. Under the base offer, about 11 crore shares (5.5%) of HUDCO, the specialised housing finance company, will be on offer. In case of oversubscription, an additional 5 crore shares (2.5%) of the company will be offered to the bidders, the company said. After the offer, the government’s stake in HUDCO will fall to 81.8%. Elara Securities, IDBI Capital Markets and SBICap Securities are managing the OFS. In the current financial year, the government has raised Rs 7,646 crore through minority stake sale, a PTI report said. Of the total, Rs 3,651 crore is from an OFS for NMDC and another Rs 3,994 crore from sale of stake in Axis Bank that was with SUUTI. This is the special purpose vehicle that holds the government’s stake that was bought over from investors nearly two decades ago when the erstwhile UTI was bifurcated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-targets-rs-720cr-from-8-in-hudco/articleshow/84773554.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Identifying the accused as Peer Mohammed, a resident of Senthamil Nagar near Sugunapuram in the city, police said he was arrested four times in the past for making hoax bomb threat calls to the control room. An investigation officer said, “Mohammed made all the calls under the influence of alcohol. On Sunday night, he called up the state police master control room four times and officials who attended the call were sure that they were hoax bomb threat calls. He had told them that the bombs would go off when he makes the 100th call.” Immediately, the officials traced the caller’s whereabouts and alerted the city police, who arrested Mohammed in the early hours of Monday and handed him over to the Chennai city police. It was in November 2017 that Mohammed made his first hoax bomb call. He called up the city police control room in an inebriated condition, stating he had planted bombs at Kuniyamuthur and surrounding areas. In the second hoax call on June 25, 2018 too, he said he had planted bombs in and around Kuniyamuthur and challenged police to trace the bombs. He called up the control room again on July 23, 2018, stating he had planted bombs at Kuniyamuthur. He was arrested and jailed on all the three occasions. In January 2020, Mohammed had called up the master control room, stating he would become a human bomb to destroy Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for denying him treatment. The Race Course police had arrested him in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/habitual-hoax-bomb-threat-caller-lands-in-police-net/articleshow/84774533.cms||---
---||Kolkata||From Kolkata to Venice: Film on City of Joy only Indian movie at 78th edition of festival||KOLKATA: Twenty-one years after Buddhadeb Dasgupta’s ‘Uttara’ won the special director’s award at the Venice Film Festival, National Award winner Aditya Vikram Sengupta’s Bengali film, ‘Once Upon A Time In Calcutta’ (OUATIC), is in competition at the coveted festival. It will be competing in the Orizzonti section and is the only Indian film at the 78th Venice International Film Festival. Sengupta’s film, starring Sreelekha Mitra and Bratya Basu, among others, will have its world premiere at the festival held from September 1-11. Bengal’s Venice connection goes back to 1934 when Debaki Kumar Bose created history there. He directed ‘Seeta’ under the East India Film Company banner and it was the first Indian talkie to be shown at any international film festival and won an honorary diploma. Bose was the first Indian to receive a global award. Satyajit Ray’s ‘Aparajito’ won the Golden Lion at the 1957 Venice Film Festival. The next big award in Bengal came for ‘Uttara’ in 2000. In 2014, Sengupta’s ‘Labour Of Love’ (‘Asha Jaoar Majhe’) was in the official selection of the 11th edition of Venice Days — an independent sidebar of the Venice Film Festival. Sengupta said, “We are excited to be back with a Bengali film about Kolkata, especially in Satyajit Ray’s birth centenary year.” Sengupta is happy to have been able to share this news with Buddhadeb Dasgupta before the ‘Uttara’ director passed away. Actor Jaya Seal Ghosh, who played the title role in ‘Uttara’, said, “A Bengali film is competing in Venice in the year Buddha kaku passed away. This is the best tribute to him.” Few contemporary Indian films have competed in Venice in recent times. Chaitanya Tamhane’s ‘The Disciple’ bagged the FIPRESCI award last year; Ivan Ayr’s ‘Meel Patthar’ had premiered in the Orrizonti last year as well while Sanal Kumar Sasidharan’s ‘Chola’ was there in 2019. Tamhane’s ‘Court’ became the first and only Indian production to have won a Best Film award in Orizzonti in 2014. Some makers have complained that Tollywood films are not even watched by the selection committee. However, Sengupta debunks all these reasons. “These are all just myths that come out of laziness. It is very difficult to go ahead if one is not ready to invest time and love something strongly enough to rear it properly,” he said. Sengupta’s film is shot by Palme d’Or winner Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s cinematographer Go-khan Tiryaki, and the music is by Dutch composer Minco Eggersman. The director said the film is his effort to chip away at the “layers of the previously communist city” to reveal a human condition that is tragic, yet optimistic. “I shot all over Kolkata and tried to give a glimpse into the murky waters of the city with colourful characters trying to find a corner of their own without drowning,” he said. Playing the role of the protagonist (Ela) is Mitra. Others in the ensemble cast include Satrajit Sarkar, Arindam Ghosh, Reetika Nondine Shimu, Anirban Chakrabarti and Shayak Roy. Non-professional actors, including Sengupta’s father Tridib, also feature in significant roles. “I have faced criticism and humiliation by my industry peers. But I continued the way I thought was right. The Venice announcement has vindicated my stand,” Mitra said. Basu said, “The selection of this film in Venice is a way of giving recognition to someone who deserves e respect.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/from-kol-to-venice-film-on-city-of-joy-only-indian-movie-at-78th-edition-of-fest/articleshow/84772081.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Till 6pm on Monday, 1,81,761 vaccine doses were administered, out of those 52,166 were first doses and 1,29,595 were second doses. Scaling up the vaccination drive, the health department in Jaipur vaccinated 115 labourers, who were among those who were left out from the drive. “Our team reached Triveni Nagar and vaccinated people in slum of labourers near the nullah,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I). In the state, 18 new Covid infections were found on Monday, bringing its overall tally to 9,53,560. No death has been reported. The death toll now stands at 8,952. Districts which reported new cases are Jaipur (5), Alwar (4), Jodhpur (2), Nagaur (2),Udaipur (2), Churu (1), Sriganganagar (1) and Hanumangarh (1). The health department is strengthening its healthcare infrastructure in rural areas amid fear of third wave of Covid-19. Health minister Raghu Sharma said that more than 18,000 medical institutions in the state are getting equipped with modern medical facilities. The effort of the government is on strengthening medical facilities in rural areas. Besides, the capacity of Covid testing has increased to 1.5 lakh tests per day, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-receives-4-6-lakh-vaccine-doses/articleshow/84774545.cms||---

---||India||Covid-19: Since May 1, private sector gave 7% of jabs despite 25% quota||Two and a half months after the Centre decided to reserve 25% of vaccines produced in India for the private sector, its own data shows that the sector accounted for only 7% of vaccinations since then. On July 20, in response to a question from Congress Rajya Sabha MP Mallikarjun Kharge, the health ministry stated that from May 1 to July 15, 2021, around 7% of total Covid vaccinations were done in private centres. TOI had reported on June 4 that private vaccination centres accounted for about 7.5% of vaccine doses administered since the beginning of the vaccination drive in January. The information given in Parliament shows that it remains at about the same level. Given this reality, public health experts question the government’s insistence on continuing with a 25% quota for private hospitals. Several state governments too have asked for the private sector quota to be slashed or even stopped. “The central government is literally pushing state government officials to increase private sector vaccinations. Despite such a high degree of persuasion from the top, private sector vaccinations are not picking up because vaccinations do not fit the model of the private sector. The private sector model is low volumes and high margins, while vaccination is about low margins on high volumes and so they are not keen on vaccination,” explained Dr T Sundararaman of the People’s Health Movement. He added that it looked like an ideological commitment to promote the private sector and a concerted administrative effort to push patients to the private sector. Its failure to take up vaccination exposes what a small section the private sector caters to in such services, he added. “The poor uptake of vaccines by the private sector proves the point that the private sector is never interested in preventive health or public good. Now with the service charge they can charge on each dose capped at Rs 150, they have no incentive to engage with vaccination. As long as pricing was unregulated, they were interested. The moment the government brought in regulation, the private sector backed off,” said Dr Rama Baru, professor at the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health in JNU. She added that since the volume of demand was at the bottom of the pyramid, where most people could not afford the price at which vaccines were being administered in the private sector, there were few takers for private sector vaccination. Prof R Ramakumar, an economist at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) who has been tracking vaccination closely, said private sector vaccine prices were just not affordable for most people. “At Rs 1,400 a shot, two doses of Covaxin would be half the monthly income of many people. As long as the Union government was procuring 100% of the shots and supplying them to the states and leaving it to state governments to decide how much to distribute to the private sector, it worked. Our vaccination rate could have been much faster if we continued that policy,” said Prof Kumar. “The idea was that private participation will take some pressure off the public health system and that the higher prices for manufacturers will incentivise them to produce more. The supply is limited even after the companies are producing the maximum they can and so a higher price as incentive makes little sense,” added Prof Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-since-may-1-private-sector-gave-7-of-jabs-despite-25-quota/articleshow/84778026.cms||Rema Nagarajan
---||Vadodara||Miffed court in Gujarat teaches insurer basics of Covid||SURAT/VADODARA: A private insurance company curtly got some basic lessons in novel coronavirus infection from the consumer court which was miffed at the reasons it submitted for rejecting the mediclaim of a Covid-19 patient. Vadodara District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum literally turned a tutor, explaining to the insurer what coronavirus was, how it spreads among humans, its common symptoms and how quickly a patient’s oxygen level can dip, resulting in a medical emergency. The case pertains to Paresh Patel, a resident of Jambuva Road in the city, whose treatment expenses of Rs 76,000 after he was hospitalized in September last year. The insurer – Universal Sompo General Insurance Company Ltd - had turned down the claim on the grounds that Patel’s vitals were stable and he did not have any respiratory complaints at the time of admission. Justifying its action, the company said that Patel’s hospitalization was only for monitoring purposes. Patel was admitted to a hospital in Maneja and later referred to Bhailal Amin General Hospital. When these reasons were submitted during the hearing, the court expressed surprise and asked how the insurance company could conclude without a medical expert’s opinion that Patel was admitted only for monitoring purposes. “There is no wisdom in the actions of the opponent (insurance company) while rejecting the claim of the complainant (Patel) and it smacks utter violation of principles of Consumer Protection Act,” the judgement read. It also asked who will be held responsible if Covid-infected patients are not admitted to hospital and something happens to them. “By merely relying upon conjecture is baseless and therefore the officer of the insurance company has shown irresponsible behaviour towards society,” the court said. The court then went on to explain what corona virus is. It also went on to state that there is no ‘licensed medication’ to cure Covid-19. But if patients are admitted to the hospital, the hospital staff takes care of them, monitors all vitals and also watches for any developing problems, the court stated in the judgement. The forum presided by I C Shah asked the insurance company to pay the entire treatment expense of Rs 76,000 to Patel along with 7% interest and Rs 20,000 as compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/miffed-court-teaches-insurer-basics-of-covid/articleshow/84782930.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Kochi||Municipality integrates Covid testing with vax||Thiruvananthapuram: While a row has erupted at Kannur and Kasaragod over Covid negative certificates for vaccination, Attingal municipality is encouraging Covid testing in exchange for vaccination by setting up antigen testing centres close to vaccination centres. Based on the test positivity rate (TPR), Attingal municipality has been in the C category for the past two weeks. TPR has remained above 10% for the last two weeks in the municipality. This has forced the health team and the municipality to devise a strategy to integrate vaccine with testing. “Initially, people did not show much interest in getting vaccinated. Once availability of vaccine became an issue and there was demand for vaccine, people started voluntarily turning up at vaccination centres. We have had a high positivity rate here for the last 2-3 weeks and still people were not interested in getting tested. We are now testing people who come for vaccination as part of encouraging more people to get tested. This will help us pick more cases and prevent the spread,” said Attingal municipality chairperson S Kumari. The chairperson also set a model by getting herself tested at a vaccination centre the other day. The health officials said that over 450 tests could be conducted in last three days. It is for the first time in the last few weeks, the daily TPR went below 7% at Attingal. “As part of the sentinel surveillance, we are doing tests to pick up asymptomatic cases. This can go a long way in preventing the spread of infection. We have recorded many cases of household transmissions in Attingal, a reason why TPR has been on the higher side. Over the last few days, we are integrating testing with vaccination,” a health official said. A special testing drive is being organized for shopkeepers and staff in shops at Attingal on Tuesday. “This is being done with good intentions. Residents are fully cooperating with our appeal to get tested at the vaccination centre. The communication has been passed to all ward councillors and everybody is encouraging people to get tested even as they get vaccinated,” said S Kumari. Meanwhile, the district reported 727 Covid-19 positive cases on Monday. As many as 1,031 people recovered from the virus. Currently, 10,762 people are under treatment for Covid-19 in the district.  Of the new cases, 665 people were infected through local contacts of which two persons are health workers. As many as 1,967 people were brought under observation in the district on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/municipality-integrates-covid-testing-with-vax/articleshow/84771907.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ludhiana||‘Bullet in stomach for 26 days’: Kin seek treatment of accused||Ludhiana: The kin of notorious criminal Aman Tattoo met the commissioner of police on Monday, seeking his treatment as “he has been living with a bullet in his stomach for the past 26 days”. They also sought FIR against the man who had opened fire at Aman.Daba police had booked Aman and his two accomplices for firing at electronics store owner Ranjot Singh on July 1. It was alleged that Aman and his accomplices had gone to the store to extort money. However, Aman’s family claimed that it was a case of cross-firing, but the police booked only him.His father Gurdeep Singh said, “On July 1, when Aman along with two others had gone to the store, Ranjot shot at him. A bullet hit Aman in stomach and is still inside his body. Aman had opened fire in retaliation. We also have the footage of the CCTV cameras. But the police did not lodge an FIR against Ranjot and arrested Aman.”“For the past 26 days, the bullet is in the stomach of Aman. Rather than getting his treatment done, the police sent him to jail. On Saturday, the Daba police had brought Aman on a production warrant from the jail. They sent him back without getting him treated. Aman may get an infection because of the bullet,” he added.The family approached commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal, seeking a fair probe. “Aman got injured with Ranjot’s weapon and despite that police are not registering a case against him. Also, I have requested for Aman’s treatment. Agarwal has marked a probe to the assistant commissioner of police (Industrial Area-B),” he said. ACP (Industrial Area-B) Randhir Singh said, “The senior medical officer’s report suggests not to operate Aman. According to the SMO, the bullet won’t harm him and the operation could be dangerous for him. In certain cases, a person can live with a bullet in the body without any complications.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bullet-in-stomach-for-26-days-kin-seek-treatment-of-accused/articleshow/84769333.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Govt & opposition trade barbs over Kodakara heist probe||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Government and opposition once again locked horns over Kodakara hawala money investigation, with the latter claiming that the former was trying to help BJP leaders by including them in the list of witnesses despite it becoming clear that the money was brought for BJP’s election purposes. Seeking a leave for adjournment motion, MLA Roji John said that the government went back on its earlier claim that the beneficiaries of the hawala money that was stolen at Kodakara will be booked. Though police found that the masterminds behind bringing the money to Kerala were BJP leaders, including state president K Surendran, police have included them in the list of witnesses and not the accused, he added. CM Pinarayi Vijayan refuted the opposition’s charges and said BJP leaders had knowledge about the money which is why they are in the list of witnesses at present. The investigation is progressing, and those in the witness list may become accused, he said. Vijayan said state police would not falsely implicate anyone in a case just on the basis of political inclination. He charged the opposition for speaking ‘on behalf of the BJP’ inside the assembly as the party has no representation in the assembly. “Should the government handover the probe for finding the source of black money to a central agency? This is a shameless stand that is being taken in favour of BJP,” he said. The chief minister further said that Congress in Kerala is taking a position that is against the one taken by its own central leadership. State leadership of Congress is trying to whitewash agencies like CBI and ED, when it’s central leadership had termed CBI as a political weapon and ED as a department of dirty tricks, he added. Meanwhile, opposition leader VD Satheesan slammed the chief minister for diverting attention from core issue to other matters instead of giving answers. He said that in a case where BJP state president K Surendran’s role was clear, the state police summoned him for interrogation three months after the incident, providing him enough time to find ways to save himself. Satheesan said that the opposition never demanded that the case should be probed by a central agency alone, but had said that there is no bar in handing over the case to a central agency like ED under the PML Act, even when the state police are undertaking a probe. He added that the chief minister would only be unsuccessful if he tried to accuse the UDF of being pro-Sangh Parivar. Later, the opposition staged a walkout after speaker MB Rajesh denied permission for adjournment motion on the basis of CM’s reply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-opposition-trade-barbs-over-kodakara-heist-probe/articleshow/84774647.cms||---

Four BSF officials have reported to the Punjab prison department and are being instructed at the jail training school in Patiala. After a month’s training, they will be deployed at four jails of Punjab. Since the Ludhiana prison has always been in controversies, it can get a BSF jail superintendent. The move will not only help increase security and strictness, but also address the prison department’s problem of shortage of eligible superintendents. The Ludhiana Central Jail has always been surrounded by rows. Cellphones, tobacco packets and intoxicating pills are often recovered from its inmates. Recently, the jail staffers were caught and booked for trying to take cellphones and tobacco packets inside the premises. In June, three staffers were suspended and one was transferred for negligence after a video of jail inmates having liquor and hookah went viral. Additional director general of police (ADGP-prisons) PK Sinha said, “Four BSF officials are being prepared at jail training school in Patiala. By August-end, they may join as jail superintendents at four prisons of Punjab. Ludhiana can be one of them. However, it is yet to be finalized by jail minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa.”  “We have shortage of eligible superintendents. The reason is there have not been recruitments from 1994 to 2016. At present, there are nine posts of superintendent for which we need eligible officials. On these posts, deputy superintendents grade-II are working as superintendents,” he added.On November 26, 2019, the Ludhiana Central Jail had got 76 CRPF personnel to guard the premises. The CRPF was deployed to check the entry of prohibited commodities like mobiles, drugs and tobacco packets, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bsf-official-likely-to-be-appointed-as-jail-supdt/articleshow/84769361.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Surat||Miffed court in Gujarat teaches insurer basics of Covid||SURAT/VADODARA: A private insurance company curtly got some basic lessons in novel coronavirus infection from the consumer court which was miffed at the reasons it submitted for rejecting the mediclaim of a Covid-19 patient. Vadodara District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum literally turned a tutor, explaining to the insurer what coronavirus was, how it spreads among humans, its common symptoms and how quickly a patient’s oxygen level can dip, resulting in a medical emergency. The case pertains to Paresh Patel, a resident of Jambuva Road in the city, whose treatment expenses of Rs 76,000 after he was hospitalized in September last year. The insurer – Universal Sompo General Insurance Company Ltd - had turned down the claim on the grounds that Patel’s vitals were stable and he did not have any respiratory complaints at the time of admission. Justifying its action, the company said that Patel’s hospitalization was only for monitoring purposes. Patel was admitted to a hospital in Maneja and later referred to Bhailal Amin General Hospital. When these reasons were submitted during the hearing, the court expressed surprise and asked how the insurance company could conclude without a medical expert’s opinion that Patel was admitted only for monitoring purposes. “There is no wisdom in the actions of the opponent (insurance company) while rejecting the claim of the complainant (Patel) and it smacks utter violation of principles of Consumer Protection Act,” the judgement read. It also asked who will be held responsible if Covid-infected patients are not admitted to hospital and something happens to them. “By merely relying upon conjecture is baseless and therefore the officer of the insurance company has shown irresponsible behaviour towards society,” the court said. The court then went on to explain what corona virus is. It also went on to state that there is no ‘licensed medication’ to cure Covid-19. But if patients are admitted to the hospital, the hospital staff takes care of them, monitors all vitals and also watches for any developing problems, the court stated in the judgement. The forum presided by I C Shah asked the insurance company to pay the entire treatment expense of Rs 76,000 to Patel along with 7% interest and Rs 20,000 as compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/miffed-court-teaches-insurer-basics-of-covid/articleshow/84769402.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Raju Sarkar, 42, among the party’s six Yuva Morcha vice-presidents had an altercation with some Morcha members in the party’s Hastings office where he suddenly complained of chest pain. He was first taken to SSKM hospital and was then being shifted to the private hospital. Police said no formal complaint has been made till late night. “It is shocking.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ACB issues two lookout notices against Param Bir Singh in graft cases||MUMBAI: Two lookout circulars have been issued by the state Anti-Corruption Bureau against former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, the outcome of the ongoing probe against him for corruption and extortion. This is to prevent Singh from leaving the country through any of the airports in the country. One lookout notice follows the FIR (First Information Report) registered by Marine Drive police station against Singh for extorting Rs 20 crore from developer Shyam Sunder Agarwal. The case was registered last week. The second one is based on an open inquriy initiated by the state Anti-Corruption Bureau after police inspector Anup Dange levelled allegations that he was suspended at the instance of Singh after he failed to favour some people involved in a pub brawl. The ACB has issued a lookout notice against Singh’s friend Jitu Navlani too, whom the former wanted to be excluded in the FIR registered by Dange. Dange had also alleged that Singh later demanded Rs 2 crore to revoke his suspension. A chargesheet has been submitted against Navlani, among others in the pub brawl case. “The Mumbai police as well as the ACB have issued two separate LOCs against Param Bir Singh,” an NCP cabinet minister told TOI. A senior police officer said that it is a routine procedure by an investigating agency. If they suspect that an accused is likely to abscond or leave the country, the LOC is issued, the officer said. Param Bir Singh has proceeded on leave subsequent to his transfer as DG, Home Guards in March this year.. Singh has said that he has to undergo a surgery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-acb-issues-two-lookout-notices-against-param-bir-in-graft-cases/articleshow/84774643.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Kochi||Stars of Rajaji Nagar take internet by storm||Thiruvananthapuram: When they decided to dance to the tunes of a hit song from Suriya’s movie Ayan, the 12 teenagers from the Chenkalchoola colony never thought that their video recorded on a mobile phone would create waves on the internet. The video featuring the popular Tamil song ‘Pala Palakkura Pagalaa Nee’ stands out for its making. Abhi, the director, cameraman and editor of the video, has overwhelmed even the professionals with his amazing skills. “I sat on the shoulders of one of my friends, with my phone attached to a selfie stick that was further mounted on a rod, to take that shot, which resembled a crane shot,” said the seventeen-year-old. Some time ago, an electrifying recreation of a stunt scene from the same movie by the group had gone viral. “After the stunt video, people asked us to do a special video on Suriya’s birthday, as a tribute to him. We are not professionals but we all wish to pursue a career in cinema. Before shooting, I looked into the minutest details of the scenes. From the internet, I tried to grasp the techniques of editing. Some shots couldn’t be replicated with perfection. There, I brought in my own creativity,” said Abhi. The group had started off with small Tik Tok videos. “Surprisingly, we found that our videos were grabbing attention. That helped us in realising our talents and we started doing more performances,” said Jobin one of the dancers. The amazing dance video was shot in 21 days and the action sequence, in 45 days. “With the phone mounted on a rod, we sometimes had to record more than 20 takes. If I was not satisfied, we would reshoot it the very next day,” said Abhi. Initially, their efforts were not taken seriously by the family and neighbours. But with this instant success, Abhi says that his family has promised him to buy a camera. “We didn’t know the scope of starting a YouTube channel. After realising that our videos are posted on many other channels, we started one –– ‘Creativity at Speak’ –– with the help of our well-wishers,” said Jobin. Meanwhile, many actors and prominent personalities, including Suriya, are showering praise on them for the amazing fight sequence and trending video song, mostly shot on the alleyways of Rajaji Nagar or Chenkalchoola. “Loved this… too good! Stay safe!”, wrote the actor while sharing the clip.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/stars-of-rajaji-nagar-take-internet-by-storm/articleshow/84771985.cms||---
---||Surat||Out of work, AC repairer kills, robs wife’s grandmother in Gujarat||SURAT: An air-conditioner repairer from Mumbai was arrested on Monday by Valsad police for murdering his grandmother-in-law and robbing cash and gold ornaments worth Rs 4.3 lakh. Police said that the accused Mohammed Anees Khan was out of work and had run into losses due to which he hatched a plan to kill his grandmother-in-law Ameena Khatun at Sarvaiyanagar in Vapi town and rob valuables from her house. Khan chose July 23 to carry out the crime as he was aware that Khatun was alone at her home on that day as his father-in-law Saifur Rehman Khan and other family members had gone to Bhiwandi to celebrate Eid. Cops were suspicious about an insider’s role in the murder as the killer knew about the valuables kept in the house and also that Khatun was staying alone for a few days. “When we reached the crime scene, the body was in the kitchen and we noticed a glass bowl filled with ‘sevaiya’ on the kitchen platform. So, these few circumstances strengthened our suspicion of an insider’s role,” said a police official. He added that Khatun would not have served the sweet in a glass bowl, had it been a stranger. Police then relied on technical aspects and probed the mobile phone locations of family members and CCTV camera footage. The special operations group found out that on July 22 and July 23, while all other family members were not in Gujarat, Khan’s phone’s location showed that he was in Vapi. Khan was picked up from his home in Ghatkopar in Mumbai for questioning. During interrogation, he admitted to the crime. He had taken a train from Mumbai to Vapi and after returning he sold the jewellery in Narayannagar area. “He remained present during the woman’s funeral and kept asking his father-in-law about the developments in the investigation,” the police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/out-of-work-ac-repairer-kills-robs-wifes-grandma/articleshow/84769465.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 2019 flood report suggestions on floodplain management ignored||MUMBAI: The large-scale damage caused by floods in western Maharashtra and Konkan has put the spotlight back on massive encroachment of floodplains and the lack of regulations in the state. Nothing much has happened on the ground to prevent floods in the two years since an expert committee, under former water resources secretary Nandkumar Vadnere, was set up to conduct an analysis of the Krishna sub-basin after the 2019 floods that ravaged districts of western Maharashtra. The report, submitted in May 2020, mentioned that “a cursory analysis of these floods revealed that it was not just the fury of nature that wreaked havoc, but a large problem can be attributed to the human interventions in the riverine and stream ecosystem”. But its recommendations have not been acted upon yet, just like several other reports on flood management and mitigation. The report, accessed by TOI, stated that apart from heavy rain, the 2019 flooding was due to the floodplains being severely affected by urbanisation, particularly in Sangli and Kolhapur districts. It mentioned that in rural areas, natural drains have been occupied by agricultural fields after necessary fillings. “Encroachment of floodplains is a serious problem. Floods have become increasingly common, but there is no political will to find ways to reduce its damage,” said Pradeep Purandare, a water conservation expert who was also a member of the Vadnere committee. This month, certains parts of the state received over 400mm of rainfall within hours which caused rivers to swell and loosened rocks on hills, said officials. More than 164 people have died due to flooding, landslides and other rain-related incidents, and nearly four lakh people have been evacuated from low-lying areas. Another recommendation of the 2019 report was to set up flood zoning authorities for Sangli and Kolhapur districts—with necessary powers, functions and duties—for regulating the land use in the flood plains and restricting/prohibiting/removing obstructions to the natural drainage. It also suggested amendment of the Maharashtra Irrigation Act, 1976, Clause 16, for the demarcation of floodplain zones. Experts said there is a gap in regulations to protect floodplains and regulate construc-tion along riverbanks, which compounds the problem. A pu-blic interest litigation by NGO Vanashakti demanding that the government take steps to preserve floodplains is pending before the high court. “It was a well-meaning policy, but was scrapped in 2015. Since then, no attempt has been made to bring in any policy to protect rivers,” said Stalin D of Vanashakti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2019-flood-report-suggestions-on-floodplain-mgmt-ignored/articleshow/84776709.cms||Bhavika Jain

The driver with the UP Roadways had been asked by his three sons to give them his six-bigha land. He said he would not. Unhappy with his call, they put him away in a room of his house in Mathura’s Sihora village, bound in chains. Singh was freed on Saturday after the senior citizens’ helpline checked up on him to find him captive. In a video, purportedly shot moments before his rescue, the emaciated man can be seen sitting on a cot in a small room, his feet bound in chains, a pitcher of water, a steel platter and a mug beneath his cot. “I had to defecate and urinate right here … They are making me lose my sanity,” he says in the video. Singh was freed on Saturday after the senior citizens’ helpline checked up on him to find him captive.The case had been on the senior citizens’ helpline radar for a while. “On June 25, we received a call from Singh. He told me that he had escaped from the house after cutting off the chains with help from his grandchildren. We reached the house with the police. The matter was resolved with verbal assurances from the family,” Pramod Solanki, field response officer of the senior citizens’ helpline in Mathura, told TOI. “Following up on the case, when I asked about him, someone told me that he had been chained again. His mobile phone had been broken by his family … We visited the house with police and social welfare department officials and freed him on Saturday.” His sons did not deny they kept him in chains but said they were doing this to “keep him out of trouble”.His sons did not deny they kept him in chains but said they were doing this to “keep him out of trouble”. Rajesh, his son, said, “All of us brothers are truck drivers. We stay away from home for long periods of time. He creates problems for others because he gets abusive after drinking. He threatened to sell the six-bigha land. He would not give it to us.” Mathura’s social welfare officer Ramashankar Gupta said it was a property dispute.

---||Mumbai||Want details of cop transfers in Anil Deshmukh’s tenure: CBI||MUMBAI: The CBI has asked the state government for details of transfer of police officers that took place during the tenure of Anil Deshmukh as home minister. It is learnt that the state may seek legal opinion before providing the details sought by the CBI. The CBI and state home department officials were unavailable for comment. A senior cabinet minister in Maharashtra confirmed receiving the letter. He said, “We have received the CBI letter and are examining its contents.” Last week, the Bombay high court had rejected the two petitions filed by the state and Deshmukh objecting to the CBI probe. The HC dismissed Deshmukh’s petition challenging the CBI FIR filed against him on April 21 on charges of bribery, corruption and criminal conspiracy. The court also dismissed a separate plea filed by the state government seeking directions to set aside two “unnumbered paragraphs” from the corruption FIR registered on April 21 against Deshmukh and other unknown persons. Subsequent to the HC order, the CBI expedited its investigation and asked the state home ministry to provide details of police transfers while Deshmukh was heading the department. The CBI registered a corruption case based on a letter written by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh to the CM alleging that then home minister Deshmukh had asked API Sachin Waze (now dismissed) and two other police officers to illegally collect Rs 100 crore from bar owners every month for him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-want-details-of-cop-transfers-in-deshmukhs-tenure-says-cbi/articleshow/84774682.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

A commission of CPM district secretariat members V M Mohanan and C V Varghese will probe the matter, said CPM Idukki district secretary K K Jayachandran. It was alleged that Rajenderan did not actively participate in the election campaign works at Devikulam constituency. Rajendran, a three-time MLA from Devikulam, expected to contest again. When it was denied, he was unwilling for campaign work and Jayachandran had to take over, said party sources. It was alleged that Rajendran tried to sabotage the caste-level vote sharing and only attended the campaign venues where he was welcomed by the leadership. The commission will collect details from Rajendran, A Raja, the current MLA from Devikulam, and the DYFI district president. Reacting to the development, Rajendran told TOI that some people within the party are trying to sideline him. “I suspect CPM unit secretary K V Sasi to be behind the fake allegation. The LDF government made many achievements in the last five years and it included my support too. But the party deliberately has not mentioned my name in any programme in the last five years. I suspect that the new allegations are to sideline me totally,” said Rajendran. “Another allegation is that I attempted to divert the votes to another caste-rival candidate. But both candidates hail from the same caste. For the last 38 years, I worked for the party’s penetration into the plantation sector and tribal areas, including Edamalakkudy. I welcome the inquiry commission and demand that they conduct a fair probe,” he added. “The reality is that Raja has not raised any allegation about campaigning. In some areas he got more votes and in some areas it was reduced,” Rajendran said. Jayachandran told TOI that the party has decided to verify the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cpm-panel-to-probe-devikulam-campaign-lapses/articleshow/84774716.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Several lives have been lost due to gaps in the boundary around Sidhwan Canal. After the accident, the traffic police placed two cemented boulders to fill the breach. The TOI took a round of the canal from South City to Lohara and found many such fatal spots. Most were identified near South City, Pakhowal Bridge and Lohara. A road safety expert said action should be taken against public works department (PWD) officials and the project directors of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) who worked at the Southern Bypass. Road safety expert Kamaljit Soi said, “The police must register a case against the officials concerned for the unfinished work. Because of their negligence, the car of youths fell into the canal from the gap between the wire barriers. At many places, they have installed cemented boulders, which are also risky. If a person riding a two-wheeler meets with an accident near these boulders, he would die on the spot.” “In January 2017, four youngsters had died in an accident near South City when their speeding car crashed into a tree. More such fatal accidents have taken place on the entire Southern Bypass, but the police have failed in keeping a check. Ludhiana’s roads are the deadliest in Punjab as these have witnessed maximum fatal accidents because of speeding. But the police have done nothing to check the practice, and even challans are not being issued for some time,” he said. Soi, who is writing to commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal for necessary action and also to the minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari, said, “I will soon meet the sessions judge and ask him to take cognisance of this as people are losing precious lives.” Joint commissioner of police (traffic) Deepak Pareek said, “We, along with the NHAI and PWD officials, have visited these spots to conduct a survey and come up with solutions. Besides, we have already sent our report on dark spots to the NHAI. The Ludhiana traffic police have got one automatic speed radar and it will be installed at the Southern Bypass to curb speeding.” On if the officials concerned could be booked for negligence, Pareek said, “We will investigate this angle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mind-the-gap-accident-prone-spots-aplenty-along-sidhwan/articleshow/84769469.cms||Payal Dhawan

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Losses mount, fish exporters agree to virtual inspection of stock by China||RAJKOT: After resisting for several months, the exporters of frozen fish have agreed to allow Chinese authorities to conduct virtual inspection of containers. Thousands of containers have piled up at various ports of China, the biggest importer of frozen fish from India, after the country rejected them on the grounds that dead Covid-19 cells were found on the outer side of packaging material. As a result of this delay, payment of crores of the exporters was held up and their finances went haywire. China has suspended the import from around 30 exporters from Gujarat in the last two months.  Earlier, the exporters had urged government of India to bring a a diplomatic solution as they have been following all Covid guidelines strictly and no country except China had objected to Indian fish. According to exporters, China rejected their containers on finding dead nucleic acid material on the packaging material.  Jagdish Fofandi, president of Seafood Exporters Association of India (SEAI) said, “We are following all international standards in exporting frozen fish but still we have given our consent for virtual inspection and informed the central government about the same. China’s claims of finding dead nucleic acid material are baseless.” According to SEAI, nearly 1,000 containers from India have been awaiting clearance at Chinese ports for months. As a result they are incurring huge losses as vessels have to pay demurrage, a charge that is payable to the shipping company for delay in cargo clearance. Chinese buyers pay only after the stock gets cleared by their authorities and they receive it at their end. Around 34 containers were returned in recent times after Chinese authorities rejected the stock. Kenny Thomas, an exporter in Veraval, said, “The returned stock of fish are rendered useless as they are specially prepared for Chinese market and there are no alternate buyers. If the situation continues, we won’t buy fish from fishermen from next season.” The fish catch from the entire Gujarat coast like Porbandar, Mangrol, south Gujarat, Diu, Okha comes to Veraval for processing and export. There are five lakh people directly getting employment from fishing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/losses-mount-fish-exporters-agree-to-virtual-inspection-of-stock-by-china/articleshow/84769511.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Kochi||Collectors in Kerala withdraw controversial order||KOZHIKODE: The collectors of Kasaragod and Kannur have revoked their controversial decisions to make Covid negative test report mandatory for people to get vaccinated following the directive issued by the government. The directive was issued after the matter was discussed at the state-level Covid review meeting held on Tuesday. The decision, which triggered widespread opposition from the public in both districts, was termed as unscientific even by many in the medical field. The government took the view that linking vaccination and testing was not necessary. Kannur collector TV Subhash said that it was decided not to link Covid vaccinations with testing considering the possibility that it could lead to vaccination hesitancy. While Kannur district collector had said that Covid negative test report was mandatory for vaccination from July 28, Kasaragod’s collector had cited the need to increase Covid testing rate for his decision. The decision met stiff opposition from various quarters and people said that the decision would lead to further delays and hardships to people who are already struggling to get slots for vaccination. Youth Congress activists had even held a dharna before Kannur collectorate demanding withdrawal of the decision. Kasaragod collector Bhandari Swagat Ranveerchand has said that government employees, merchants, people working in shops and those who interact with the public should get tested for Covid once in two months. She added that those who have received vaccination need not undergo Covid testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/collectors-withdraw-controversial-order/articleshow/84805312.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Garbage on streets raises a stink in Ooty||UDHAGAMANDALAM: It’s the rotten smell of garbage that has piled up on roadsides that welcomes one to the tourist town of Ooty. The garbage collection in the town had come to a standstill three days ago, with Ooty municipality workers boycotting work to register their protest against the delay in disbursing salary for the month of June. Now, all the streets in the town are dotted with piles of garbage. On Monday, the municipality workers, including the sanitary workers, continued the protest in front of the municipal office for the fourth consecutive day. Later, a talk was held between the workers union and municipality authorities. Ravi, executive member, Union of Workers’ Association, said, “During the talk, municipality authorities have assured to pay the pending salary to all the workers. We have to slog to remove the garbage from the streets. As there was no collection of garbage for the three days, public have dumped them on the roadsides.” Of the 500 municipality workers, including those on contract basis, around 300 of them are sanitary workers. The municipality had credited salary for the sanitary workers to their bank accounts on Friday. “Now, we want the municipality to settle the pending salary for the remaining workers,” Ravi said. A Shanmugam, a local resident, said the roads in Ooty town were filthy. “Sanitary workers are keeping the town clean. Their salaries cannot be held back for a month.” Saraswathi, Ooty municipal commissioner, said the workers were not paid because of the fund crunch. “We are not able to collect commercial taxes from lodges, cottages and other business establishments because of the pandemic situation. We are also yet to get Rs42 crore as rent from shopkeepers in the Ooty municipal market.” Pointing out that the sanitary workers were paid the June salary on Friday, she said they didn’t know why they were still protesting without returning to work. The municipality workers are, meanwhile, likely to take a call on calling off the protest on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/garbage-on-streets-raises-a-stink-in-ooty/articleshow/84774707.cms||---

The proposal of Sarnath was submitted in cultural category by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in July 1998, and since then it has been in UNESCO’s tentative list, while the Ramappa temple, a 13th century engineering marvel named after its architect, Ramappa, was proposed by the government as its only nomination for the UNESCO World Heritage site tag for the year 2019. After attaining enlightenment in Bodh Gaya (Bihar), Buddha had preached his first sermons and set the wheel of Dhamma in motion at Sarnath in Varanasi. Situated around 8km from the Varanasi district headquarters, Sarnath has several monuments, which are divided into two groups. Under Group ‘A’ Chaukhandi Stupa and under Group ‘B’ all other monuments at the sites including stupas, monasteries, temples, etc. Chaukhandi Stupa is a lofty brick structure crowned with an octagonal tower. According to the description mentioned in the tentative list, the octagonal tower is a Mughal monument built by Goverdhan, the son of Raja Todarmal in AD 1588 to commemorate the visit of Humayun to this place. The second group, which contains remains of several stupas, monasteries and Ashokan columns are built in brick and stone and datable from the 3rd century BC to 12th century AD, forms the major and important segment of the site. The Ashokan column Dharamrajika stupa, Dhameka stupa, the remains of the temple and a series of monasteries and votive stupas are the most important remains of the site. “We had prepared a dossier of the Sarnath Buddhist sites for the main list of UNESCO’s World Heritage and sent it to the directorate in 2020,” superintending archaeologist of ASI Sarnath circle NK Sinha told TOI on Monday. According to sources, the dossier is yet to be sent to the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO for nomination in the heritage list. Meanwhile, the iconic riverfront of Varanasi has also been included in the tentative list of UNESCO’s World Heritage on April 13 this year after the proposal was submitted by the permanent delegation of India to UNESCO. As per operational guidelines, it is mandatory to put any monument/site on the tentative list before it is considered for the final nomination dossier. As per rules, any country can submit the nomination dossier after one year of it being on the tentative list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/sarnaths-23-year-wait-for-place-in-unesco-list-grows-longer/articleshow/84770957.cms||---

Leaders said that cow slaughter would not be tolerated at any cost in the country. VHP has also decided to impart training to farmers so that Indian origin cows should be kept at every house in villages. Leaders of VHP ( Gauraksha division) Kashi prant were holding a meeting at Shankaracharya ashram, Alopibagh on Monday. Senior VHP leader and national organisational secretary (Gauraksha division) Khemchandra Sharma said gau mata (cows) are the central devotion point (kendra bindu) for hindu community. He also said the Indian culture can be protected only when we protect cows, Ganga and villages. He also stressed on the need to protect original breed of cows ( Indian origin crows) at a time when Indian origin cows were finding no place in the society. People were more interested to keep jersey cows for their economic benefits but there was a strong need to take care of Indian origin cows or they would be an extinct species. VHP leaders said that strength of Indian origin cows was declining by every passing day and if the similar condition continues, cows would be seen at museum only. Speakers stressed on need to make farmers self reliant and develop industries in villages. Lal Mani Tiwari, regional secretary (VHP gauraksha) said that it should be every individual responsibility to protect cows and they should also come forward for it. He also said that majority of gaushala were fallen prey to corruption and many cows were loosing their lives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/vhp-tp-set-up-gau-raksha-committees-at-all-villages/articleshow/84769898.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Ooty: Hill town turns senior citizens away sans jab after long wait||UDHAGAMANDALAM: The failure of Ooty municipality officials to streamline the vaccination drive has hit hard the senior citizens, who are made to wait in queue for hours together but only to be sent back without inoculating them. There are reports that municipality officials are not issuing tokens area wise, despite instructions in this regard from the district administration. On Monday, the municipality and health officials failed to regulate the crowd at the three camps in Ooty, where vaccination for senior citizens was scheduled. Senior citizens were made to wait in the queue along with other people and many of them were later sent back empty-handed. Social distancing too was not maintained during the drive. In a press statement, district collector J Innocent Divya had earlier said 1,000 doses of Covishield were allotted to Ooty town and the vaccination drive would be held at Breeks Higher Secondary School, Sri Shanthi Vijai Girls’ Higher Secondary School and CSI Hobart Middle School on Monday. There was an indication that senior citizens and people due for the second shot would be given preference and at least 50% of the doses was meant for the same. Kandasamy, 74, told TOI, “I have been waiting in the queue for more than two hours. There is no separate queue for senior citizens. Officials in the vaccination centre don’t seem to be bothered about it.” Mahalakshmi, 62, who was sent back from Shanthi Vijai Girls’ Higher Secondary School, said she had gone to Breeks School to try her luck, but only to be turned away around 1pm as the doses had exhausted by then. People who had turned up for their first dose were, however, inoculated at the centre. L Raman, who is awaiting his second dose of the jab, said, “More than 120 days have lapsed since my first dose of vaccination. The vaccination drive for senior citizens and those awaiting their second doses is not streamlined.” When contacted, Dr Sridhar, municipal health officer, said, “We had issued tokens for 50% of the doses. Others had to wait in the queue to get inoculated.” However, it was found that no tokens were issued to anyone in advance. R Hemanth, another resident, said, “Officials at the vaccination centres are not following the district administration’s instructions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/hill-town-turns-senior-citizens-away-sans-jab-after-long-wait/articleshow/84774738.cms||---

The teachers union told TOI that several of their colleagues are posted in the rural hilly locations for almost 20 years and haven't got a chance to get a posting in their preferred location. They further accused that many teachers who have got relations with the senior government officials are being deputed in the schools which are located in their home district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-teachers-association-going-to-protest-against-state-government-for-not-implementing-transfer-act/articleshow/84772090.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Agra||Thousands of dead fish wash ashore on Yamuna banks in Agra||AGRA: Industrial waste gushing into the Yamuna from Delhi, release of stagnant water from Mathura’s Gokul barrage and non-functional sewage treatment plants seem to have turned the river waters “highly toxic” — shoals of dead fish washed ashore on the banks of the Yamuna in Agra over the past few days. “First, polluted water from the Okhla barrage in Delhi was discharged. Then, the water entered Mathura’s Gokul barrage and was contained. When the stagnant water of the Gokul barrage was released, it was highly toxic and got further polluted upstream in Agra as industrial effluents continued to be discharged along with sewage,” said environmentalist Devashish Bhattacharya, who visited the site. “When that happened, oxygen levels in the water went down and aquatic animals died.” The state of the Yamuna in the Okhla barrage has long been alarming — toxic foam forms over the waters because of heavy effluents. Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) data from May this year showed that there was absolutely no dissolved oxygen in the Yamuna at Okhla barrage. In a report submitted to the Jal Shakti ministry on Monday, the Delhi government said that the 22-km stretch of Yamuna from Wazirabad to Okhla in Delhi, less than 2% of the river, accounts for about 80% of the pollution load in the river. “It is a matter of concern,” UPPCB regional officer Bhuvan Yadav told TOI. “The dead fish washed ashore in the period when the flow of water at Gokul barrage was stopped and then resumed. That had depleted oxygen levels in the water.” What adds to this, sources told TOI, is that sewage treatment plants at points where the Yamuna enters Agra — Budi ka Nagla and Jaganpur — have not been functioning. Sewage pumping stations in Manoharpura, Balkeshwar, Rajwaha and Naraich are also not working properly, a source added. According to the latest data from the Yamuna Pollution Control Unit under UP Jal Nigam, 90 drains were discharging sewage waste of about 286 million litres per day in Agra in January. However, only 105 million litres per day were being treated at nine sewage treatment plants. “Besides, of the 90 drains, only 29 have been tapped,” an official said. The gap between sewage generation and treatment remains one of the major challenges in addressing river pollution. Central Pollution Control Board data from March 2021 showed that urban areas in the country generate over 72,000 million litres per day of sewage. But the country’s combined sewage treatment capacity is a little under 32,000 million litres per day, less than half.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/thousands-of-dead-fish-wash-ashore-on-banks-in-agra/articleshow/84769550.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The matter came to light after the video of the woman's statement went viral on social media on Monday. The woman told senior police officials on Sunday that Deepak Singh, a resident of the Chakeri area whom she had befriended in February this year, took her to Unnao on June 14, held her hostage for three days, raped her and made a video of the act. When she resisted, Deepak severely thrashed her and threatened to make her video viral, she said. When she made a complaint at Chakeri's Ahirwan police out-post, no action was taken. She alleged that when she complained about the matter to inspector Chakeri, he asked uncomfortable questions. "The inspector asked me to tell in detail how the rape happened. Apart from this, he also made many obscene comments on me”, she further alleged in her complaint. Police commissioner Asim Kumar Arun while talking to reporters said that the allegations levelled by the woman against the inspector were serious. "An inquiry has been ordered in the matter. Action will be taken if the allegations are found true", he said.

The youths’ friend, Rahul, 20, of Gurdaspur, had escaped unhurt as he jumped out of the car before it plunged in the water body. Rahul has told the police that the hatchback, which was ahead of them, suddenly took a turn. “As a result, our car hit it, went out of control and fell into the canal,” he said. ASI Baljinder Singh said, “The hatchback (PB 10 GS 7554) is owned by advocate Parveen Jindal. It is yet to be ascertained if he was driving it at the time. It has been impounded.” The FIR has been lodged under sections 279 (rash driving), 304-A (causing death by negligence) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the IPC. On the day, autopsy of the three deceased, Pahul, Prabhjot and Tiksha, was conducted. Tiksha’s father Brijesh Siani said his daughter aspired to be a scientist. About one-and-a-half months ago, she had come her for an internship at ICAR in Punjab Agricultural University. Pahul’s father Jatinder Singh, an Army subedar posted in Jammu & Kashmir, said, “Pahul had celebrated his 19th birthday last month. He was studying for IELTS to go abroad.” Prabhjot’s grandfather Joginder Singh said, “Prabhjot’s father and elder brother are settled in Italy. Prabhjot and his mother had recently got the visa and were to go there after one-and-a-half months. Prabhjot and Pahul are childhood friends and left the house saying they were going to Ludhiana for shopping.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/driver-of-hatchback-that-caused-accident-booked/articleshow/84769513.cms||Payal Dhawan

The police said that the incident was the fallout of a dispute over three ‘bighas’ of agricultural land and efforts are on to nab the accused. Rajkumar’s 15-year-old son Raghavendra Kushwaha was sleeping on a cot in the ‘verandah’ of the house along with his mother Kusumkali and elder sister Sarita on Sunday night in village Ranipur of Kamasin police station area. “Late in the night, one Virendra Singh and Santu Savita of the village reached there and held the teenager sleeping there at gun-point.

The case was filed after a video, purportedly showing Agarwal and a few others taking an oath to kill Sher Singh Rana, was shared on social media platforms. The alleged event took place in Parauli village, Shikarpur region of Bulandshahr on the 20th death anniversary of Phoolan Devi on Sunday. Bulandshahr senior superintendent of police (SSP) Santosh Kumar Singh said, “We have filed an FIR against two persons, including Shikhar Agarwal, for disturbing peace and promoting hatred among different communities and efforts are on to arrest them.” Agarwal has denied the charges. “My statement was taken out of context. I did not say ‘we will kill Rana’. What we meant that he (Rana) should be hanged after the due process of law. But now police are targeting me and my family for following the ideals of Phoolan Devi,” he said. The FIR filed after the event says, “It came to our notice through a video uploaded on social media that the death anniversary of former MP Phoolan Devi was being observed in the house of one Naresh Kashyap in Parauli village. The video shows Bulandshahr violence accused Shikhar Agarwal is instigating people by raising hateful and vengeful slogans to kill Sher Singh Rana. Both Naresh Kashyap and Shikhar Agarwal have been booked under IPC section 505-2 (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes).” Agarwal is one of the main accused in 2018 Bulandshahr violence in which police inspector Subodh Singh was killed by mob during a protest against alleged cow slaughter. A Samajwadi Party MP, Phoolan was shot dead on July 25, 2001, outside her official residence in Delhi by Rana. Thirteen years later in 2014, Rana was sentenced to life imprisonment. Delhi high court granted him bail in October 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bulandshahr-violence-accused-exhorts-group-to-kill-phoolans-assassin-booked/articleshow/84766703.cms||Sandeep Rai

While there are no clear answers for why the doctor got Covid thrice, doctors told TOI that the reasons could range from SARS2 variants to her immunity levels to an incorrect diagnostic report (though RT-PCR is the gold standard for Covid-19 testing, it has a sensitivity of around 70%-75%). Reinfections among doctors have been reported across the world, with a couple of studies from within Mumbai hospitals as well. However, reinfections cannot be proved until swab samples from the two (or more) infections are compared using genetically sequencing. On Monday, a BMC official said Halari’s latest samples were collected to check why she got infected despite vaccination. Studies — one by BMC and another by a private hospital — are underway to look at reasons for breakthrough infections in collaboration with the Foundation for Medical Research (FMR). Dr Halari, who tested positive the first time on June 17, 2020, while working in BMC’s Covid centre in Mulund, was RT-PCR positive on two more occasions — May 29 and July 11. “I got mild symptoms all three times,” she said. The first time she got tested for Covid-19 last year was because a colleague tested positive. In July, her entire family, including her parents and 21-year-old brother, tested positive. Regarding Dr Halari’s three positive reports, her treating doctor, Mehul Thakkar said, “It could a case of an incorrect RT-PCR report or that the second infection in May got reactivated in July”. Dr Thakkar had highlighted her case to BMC health officials, which led to swab samples being collected for the FMR-BMC study. FMR director Dr Nerges Mistry said reinfections could occur due to several reasons, including a person’s immunity levels or autoimmune conditions. “One other reason could be emergence of a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-mumbai-doctor-tests-positive-thrice-twice-after-vaccination/articleshow/84778049.cms||Malathy Iyer

The myth is that CMs who have stayed in this bungalow have failed to complete their full term. So, the official residence is often referred to as “jinxed and unlucky”. Prior to the shifting, priests conducted religious rituals. Sources pointed out that some Vastu corrections were also made to "keep the house free from any sort of negative energy".

Despite staying away, Tirath’s tenure lasted for four months. Soon after taking charge as CM, Dhami had reversed Tirath’s decision. “There is no point in wasting an important resource,” he said. Designed in a Pahari style, the bungalow, with 60 rooms, was built in 2010. The massive structure, comprising a badminton court, swimming pool, several lawns, separate office for the CM and his team, had cost Rs 16 lakh.Designed in a Pahari style, the bungalow, with 60 rooms, was built in 2010.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Karol Bagh market in tatters, traders worried they may lose that too||NEW DELHI: Shopkeepers at a market in Karol Bagh are worried about losing their shops which they have been running for the past 45 years. North Delhi Municipal Corporation has recently issued an order to the shopkeepers at a complex located adjoining Gaffar Market on Saraswati Marg and asked them to vacate the premises as the market building was found to be in a dilapidated state during a survey conducted by IIT Roorkee. The civic body plans to redevelop this place on a public-private partnership basis. Shopkeepers claim that the north corporation’s project is only aimed at getting the shops vacated. “The civic body had made similar attempts in 2011 and 2016 and when they failed to get the complex vacated, the building has now been declared dangerous. The project will take years to complete and after construction, shops will be sold in crores. The project is a threat to our livelihood,” said Harish Chitkara, president of Karol Bagh Mobile Traders’ Association. “It is surprising that a building given on a 99-year lease turned out to be dangerous within just 45 years and traders are being asked to vacate it before the end of the lease period,” he stated. TOI visited the complex on Monday and found it in a dilapidated condition. At many places, the plaster was coming out, iron rods were visible on the roof, wires were hanging, window glasses on upper floors were broken and even the outer wall was partly broken on the first floor. Sanitation condition was also not up to the mark. Standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain said that there was no concrete plan on redevelopment of the place yet. “But if the complex is vacated or any other such development happens, then we will give alternative sites/shops within the area to the shopkeepers for a temporary period. After reconstruction/renovation, we will give them back shops with the same terms and conditions. We will call a meeting with these traders and officials concerned soon. Right now, our focus is the safety of people,” said Jain. The market was developed in 1975 and shops were given on lease for 99 years in 1976. On the ground floor, there are a total of 75 shops, a majority of them selling mobile and electronic items. Most of the shops on the upper four floors are empty. “The building has been in a deplorable state despite us paying 10% of licensing fees as maintenance charges to the civic agency. We even asked them permission for carrying out repair work on our own, but most of the time, it is not sanctioned,” said Tanuj Malhotra, executive member and a trader.

---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Ahead of polls, rifts come to fore in United Cycle Parts Manufacturers Association||LUDHIANA: With just about a month to go for the elections of the United Cycle Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA), different groups have started making moves for staking their claims on the association during the next tenure already. With these attempts, tussles have also ensued between different groups to outdo each other to woo the members and, as a result, friction between the present managing committee members who owe allegiance to different groups has also started coming to the fore. The tenure of the present managing committee is coming to end on September 6 and it’s likely that the elections of UCPMA might be held in first week of September. In the recent incident, a directory of the members of UCPMA was released amid fanfare at a city-based hotel, but to everyone’s disappointment, the most prominent office bearer of the association, president D S Chawla was and secretary Harsimerjit Singh Lucky were conspicuous with their absence. However, all the different power centres, old rivals and even former presidents were present in this function that saw presence of six current office-bearers of the association. Neither Chawla nor Manjinder Singh Sachdeva, general secretary of UCPMA (who attended the directory launch function) could be contacted for their response. Speaking to TOI on condition of anonymity, a prominent member of UCPMA, who is former office-bearer said current president D S Chawla will contest the elections again while Kular and Vishiwkarma group, who until now were arch rivals, will field joint candidate for the post of the president. However, no one is ready yet to open his cards for the elections but groundwork to garner support from members, politicians and prominent businessmen has already been started by the different groups. Why UCPMA and its president are important UCPMA, which is the biggest body representing the bicycle industry, comprises more than 2,000 members. The elected office-bearers of this association, president in particular, holds quite an influence in the administrative and political circles and across all departments. This is largely because of both ruling and opposition parties in the state give importance to UCPMA , due to prominent factory owners being members of this association and the number of votes the association has influence over. Besides this, be it any social, political or other cause, the services of UCPMA are required from time to time — some departments use UCPMA platform to launch schemes and camps for industry like the recent camps that vaccinated city residents en masse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ahead-of-polls-rifts-come-to-fore-in-ucpma/articleshow/84774781.cms||Mohit Behl

On Monday alone, 240 Shiva devotees trying to enter Uttarakhand illegally were ferried out of state borders on special buses and trains. “The devotees have ditched their saffron attire this time and are wearing plain clothes so it is harder to identify them. We’ve now started checking details of each passenger exiting the railway station, such as RT-PCR test report and address proof, to identify the yatris. We were able to identify 240 such passengers and sent them back on Monday,” said Manoj Katyal, additional superintendent of government railway police (Haridwar). Some pilgrims were sent back to state borders in buses while others were sent home on trains such as Mussoorie Special, Amritsar Special and Howrah Special. The railways are also distributing pamphlets and making announcements at stations about cancellation of Kanwar yatra. Meanwhile, six pilgrims from Rajasthan and Gujarat who had arrived to take a dip in Ganga were found Covid positive during testing at the Haridwar railway station and sent to a Covid care facility in the district hospital. “We conducted over 800 tests on Monday and six pilgrims tested positive,” said station house officer (GRP Haridwar Railway station) Anuj Singh. On Sunday, 14 kanwarias from Haryana’s Sonipat were detained by Haridwar Police and booked under the Disaster Management Act. They were quarantined at the state's Prem Nagar ashram facility. Two locals caught selling items to kanwarias were also booked. More than 1,000 police personnel have been deployed on different inter-state border points to stop the movement of kanwarias. Additional police pickets have come up at Purkazi, Morna, Khanpur and Sikandarpur areas along the Uttarakhand-UP border.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Conspiracy against BJP out in CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s speech, says Kerala BJP president K Surendran||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP state president K Surendran, on Monday, alleged that chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s speech in the assembly on Kodakara hawala money heist has exposed the political conspiracy. “The chief minister has misled the house by telling that the money involved in the Kodakara case belonged to BJP. The chief minister is trying to settle a political score against BJP after being embroiled in the gold and dollar smuggling cases. The CM claimed that Deepak, one of the accused in the money heist case, was a BJP worker. It’s a plain lie,” he said. Surendran said that all the 21 people arrested by police in connection with the case have CPM connections. “The gang that is responsible for the Ramanattukara gold heist case was behind the Kodakara case. They have close connections with CPM leaders,” he alleged. There was nothing in the FIR that can connect BJP with the hawala money. Being the home minister of the state, Vijayan should have apologised in the house for haunting the BJP unnecessarily, he added. Surendran had earlier alleged that the probe team was not inclined to recover the money from the smugglers and that the police were trying to save persons accused in the case. “The chargesheet is weak and built on lies. It will not stand legal scrutiny. What the police claim as the CDR of BJP leaders is fake. BJP would soon release the call detail record (CDR) of BJP leaders in question,” Surendran had said. The chargesheet submitted by SIT in the highway heist case states that nearly Rs 40 crore was brought to Kerala for BJP leaders using hawala operators during the recent assembly elections. But, the chargesheet arraigned BJP leaders (including Surendran) as witnesses and not the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/conspiracy-against-bjp-out-in-cms-speech-surendran/articleshow/84774774.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Declared 'maneater', 7th leopard shot dead in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: Nearly 48 hours after a leopard snatched away a toddler playing in her front yard in Uttarakhand’s Rudraprayag district, a team of three shooters has put down the big cat on Monday— the seventh maneater to be shot dead in the state this year. The attack occurred on Saturday when a one-and-half-year-old girl was dragged away by the animal in Silla-Bahman village in Jakholi tehsil. A forest team combed the area to locate the animal and the toddler but to no avail following which a team of shooters was deployed. Shooter Joy Hukil — for whom the leopard is the 42nd maneater he has put down — said the leopard was an 8-year-old female and had to be killed after it attacked a forest ranger during rescue efforts. While village residents were relieved after news spread that the animal had been put down, the bereaved family is yet to find closure as there was no trace of the victim’s body. Rajneesh Lohani, range officer of North Jakholi range (Rudraprayag forest division), said an initial amount of Rs 1.2 lakh has been paid to the family as compensation. “We have not released the full ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh because we are yet to find the body. Usually, we find blood-stained clothes of the victim or other such evidence, but in this case we haven’t found anything so far,” he said. Meanwhile, another man who was left battling for his life after being attacked by a leopard in Dakuda ghat village in Pithoragarh district died on Monday, taking the toll of those who died in leopard attacks this year to 19. Five of the victims were attacked in the last 10 days alone. This comes even as search is still on for a maneater that killed a 10-year-old boy in Pithoragarh’s Pali village in Gangolihaat last week. Forest officials said six maneaters who were put down earlier had all been suffering from physical disabilities, including injured paw and broken canines. “A disability can make it harder for the animal to attack robust prey, turning them into maneaters,” said J S Suhag, chief wildlife warden of the Uttarakhand forest department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/declared-maneater-7th-leopard-shot-dead-in-ukhand/articleshow/84772234.cms||Shivani Azad

Siddiqui exports mangoes to countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Malaysia, the US and Japan. “The Bhutan embassy had requested for the mangoes, and they were bearing the cost of the transportation as well,” Siddiqui told TOI. The annual production of mango in Amroha is at least 22 lakh tonnes, and it is exported to Gulf and European countries. This time around, however, it is also being exported to neighbouring Bhutan. According to Siddiqui, “A consignment of one ton of mangoes — comprising four varieties, including Langada, Chausa and Amrapali — was dispatched from Saharanpur to Delhi, from where the consignment would be dispatched to Bhutan by air. The mangoes will be distributed among locals in Bhutan during a festival.” “Bhutanese businessmen have, meanwhile, expressed their desire to do mango business with Amroha,” he said. Siddiqui said that the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic hit the export of Amroha mangoes. “This time, besides Bhutan, orders have also been received from Dubai.

The NDRF team in Ratnagiri retrieved the body of a one and half year-old male child, 2 kms away from the Pedhegaon landslide site under Chiplun taluka and will continue its operations at Dhamnand village in Khed. “As the relatives refused to take decomposed bodies of their kin at Taliye village, the NDRF, SDRF and TDRF (Thane) teams were forced to wind up the rescue operations. However, staff from the district administrative will stay for two more days,” said Dilip Rayannavar, a Tehsildar overseeing the operation. “To address multiple post flood challenges and under Covid, police have been asked to provide security on highways to ensure relief materials arrive at the desired spot.

---||Thane||Maharashtra: Proposal to tag Thane Creek as Ramsar site||Nagpur: The biodiversity-rich Thane Creek, which is one of the largest creeks in Asia receiving huge congregation of birds, has been proposed as a Ramsar site. A Ramsar site is a wetland site designated to be of international importance. The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar Convention) is an international treaty that provides for global cooperation for the conservation of wetlands. It was signed on February 2, 1971, in Ramsar in Iran. Presently, Maharashtra has two Ramsar sites: Nandur Madhmeshwar in Nashik declared in January 2020 and Lonar crater in Buldhana district announced in November 2020. State principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Sunil Limaye said he had forwarded the draft proposal submitted by Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest, Mumbai mangrove cell, to the principal secretary (forest) on July 14. Limaye told TOI, “The Maharashtra State Wetland Authority will take a call and forward the proposal to the ministry of environment, forest and climate change. If notified as Ramsar, it will provide access to financial aid through the convention’s small grants. Besides, it will encourage international cooperation on wetlands and bring access to expert advice on national and site related problems, its conservation, and management.” Thane creek encompasses a total area of over 6,522 hectares of which 1,690 hectares has been declared as Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary and 4,832 hectares is proposed to be notified as an eco-sensitive zone. Underlining the need for declaring it as a Ramsar site, Tiwari said, “Thane creek is fringed by mangroves on both the banks and comprises around 20% of the total Indian mangrove species. These comprise true mangroves (13 species), mangrove associates (36 species), and a large community of grey mangrove trees, shrubs, non-halophytic non-mangrove associates in the area, halophytic herbs, shrubs, and weeds.” He added that the mangrove forest acts as a natural shelter belt and protect the land from cyclones, tidal surges, seawater seepage, and intrusions. The mangroves serve as a nursery to several fish species and sustain the local fishery. The high species diversity of birds in Thane Creek sanctuary and presence of many gl-obally important species, alo-ng with the rich abundance of lesser flamingos and greater flamingos and lakhs of other resident and migratory water birds, make this area globally significant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-proposal-to-tag-thane-creek-as-ramsar-site/articleshow/84774899.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Replying to a submission by MLA MM Mani, Rajan said that the rules being amended would be in cases where constructions were done within 15 cents for residential purposes where the area is less than 1,500sq ft. The assignees will have to prove that they have no other land at other places to avail this concession, the minister said. The government has taken this policy decision after widespread constructions came to its notice in land assigned for agricultural purposes in Munnar, especially KDH, Chinnakanal, Pallivasal, Anaviratti, Vellathooval, Santhanpara, Bison Valley and Anavilasom villages. In the case of Munnar, the court had intervened when the land awarded for agri purposes began to be widely used for construction activities, in violation of the law. The minister said that on the basis of the high court order, the government had made it mandatory for the revenue department to issue a no-objection certificate for construction in these villages. The department’s certificate makes it mandatory to mention the purpose for which land is being assigned. The minister added that since the matter is sub-judice (before the high court), the law department has given its opinion that the government should take permission from the high court for amending the rules in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/government-looking-to-amend-rules-with-riders-says-k-rajan/articleshow/84774863.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||2nd custodial death in Haldwani jail in days? FIR filed||Nainital: Days after the Uttarakhand high court ordered a CBI probe into the death of an inmate in Haldwani sub-jail, police have lodged an FIR in connection with another death in judicial custody in the same prison. The FIR was registered on Saturday after the family of Irshad (55), who was brought to the jail on May 25, alleged that he was "beaten up and killed". The inmate, from UP’s Rampur, was booked for attempt to murder in US Nagar district. In his written complaint, Irshad's father said he had tried to visit his son on July 10, but he was turned away by jail officials. Two days later, he was informed that his son had died of tuberculosis in Haldwani's Sushila Tiwari Medical Hospital. The father has alleged that Irshad had no such disease and died after he was beaten up in prison. Police have registered a case under section 302 (murder) of the IPC against unknown people. “We are investigating the matter,” said Haldwani circle officer (CO) Shantanu Parashar. Jail officials told TOI that the autopsy report is awaited. “He (Irshad) was suffering from TB and was taken to the hospital on July 10 after his condition deteriorated. He died in the hospital and the autopsy was videographed. There were no injuries or any other evidence that pointed to a beating,” a jail official said. Just last week, the high court had slammed police for delay in filing an FIR after an inmate’s wife in the same jail had alleged that he died due to beatings by prison guards. Pravesh Kumar was sent to prison on March 5 and was found dead the next day. His wife alleged that another jail inmate who was released a few days after Kumar’s death had informed her that he was thrashed by prison guards before he passed away. The FIR in the matter was registered a month after the incident following the orders of the chief judicial magistrate. The HC had observed that the autopsy report showed as many as 10 injuries on his body and yet the statement of the doctor who performed the procedure was not recorded by police. The court had also sought transfer of Nainital SSP and Haldwani circle officer, and wondered if “ties of brotherhood” had led police to find no evidence of the beating by prison guards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/2nd-custodial-death-in-haldwani-jail-in-days-fir-filed/articleshow/84772395.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Agra||Baby on demand: Gang kidnapping infants, selling them for Rs 45,000-5 lakh busted in UP||AGRA: Since December last year, at least six unsuspecting couples in UP towns suddenly found their newborns had gone missing. There was never any ransom demand — the children simply disappeared. Seven months on, police found the gang behind it had allegedly worked out an elaborate plan — identify childless couples, promise them a baby, kidnap a newborn and then sell the infant for anywhere between Rs 45,000 and Rs 5 lakh. Sixteen people, including eight members of the gang and eight others — among them mediators and people who bought the kids — have been arrested and sent to jail. Each member of the gang had their work cut out, Aligarh SP (city) Kuldeep Gunawat told TOI. The five women in the gang — Babli, Chandni, Rekha, Neha and Rashmi — would be on the lookout for couples who wanted a child. Lately, though, police said, some had approached the gang after they heard about the off-the-books “solution” to their problem from couples who had received "help". After this, the gang would strike a deal with the couple, promising a child of whichever gender they preferred in exchange for money. They would then activate their network of midwives, who would tell them about expecting mothers whose children could be whisked away. This is where other members of the gang would take over. Babli’s brother Duryodhan from Etah, Anil from Ghaziabad and Shubham from Hathras would kidnap the newborn and hold them at their own homes. The women of the gang would then hand over the child, take the money and close the deal. For months, their operation went undetected. On Sunday, Aligarh police received a tip-off — three men on a bike were “planning” to kidnap an infant. At a crossing in Borna village, a team of cops stopped the bike and took the three men in for questioning. “When they were interrogated, they spilled the beans on their child lifting operation,” Aligarh SSP Kalanidhi Naithani said. The three men were Duryodhan, Anil and Shubham. On the basis of what they said, police zeroed in on the couples who had bought the babies and others involved in the alleged racket. “A two-month-old girl (yet to be sold, found at Babli’s neighbour house) and a nine-month-old boy from Ghaziabad (sold for Rs 1 lakh), and three kids younger than two from Aligarh (sold at Rs 45,000-Rs 5 lakh) were rescued,” the SSP said. “One boy, believed to have been kidnapped in December 2020, is yet to be traced. He was allegedly sold off to a couple in Mumbai through a contact in Noida.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/baby-on-demand-gang-kidnapping-infants-selling-them-for-rs-45k-5l-busted-in-up/articleshow/84769711.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Soon, protocols for surgery of gender reassignment||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government has initiated steps to frame protocols for undertaking gender reassignment surgery in the state, in the wake of the death of Anannyah Kumari Alex, a transgender who allegedly committed suicide due to serious health issues after undergoing the surgery. Social justice and higher education minister R Bindu said in the assembly on Monday that the transgender justice board, chaired by the minister, that met on July 23 decided to constitute an expert committee to make necessary recommendations for addressing the physical and mental health issues faced by the transgender community and to frame a protocol for gender reassignment surgery. “Presently, there is no protocol in the state for gender reassignment surgery and it is conducted only in private hospitals. There are no particular guidelines regarding treatment methods, follow-up actions and quality of treatment. It has come to the government’s notice that this is causing several mental and physical health problems. In the wake of the recent death of Anannyah Kumari Alex, government finds it necessary to intervene in this matter,” the minister said. The board meeting decided to entrust the expert committee to study and give recommendations for providing necessary training to doctors, who are experts in such surgeries, in the government sector, while also preparing protocols on the basis of care standards of the world professional association for transgender health, the minister said. Along with health experts, the committee will include a transgender representative and also a representative from those working for the upliftment of the transgender community. The minister said that the expert committee will submit the report in three months. The recommendations of the committee would be examined and government will take action based on it. The board has also entrusted the social justice director to make necessary recommendations for providing health insurance for the transgender community members and for including them in the priority list of beneficiaries for Life Mission. The government has also entrusted the social justice director to speed up the steps to frame the rules for implementing the provisions of Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, the minister said. In addition, the board will also urge the general and higher education departments to examine the possibility of including topics on sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics in the educational curriculum. It has already been decided to reserve seats in all courses in all the institutions under the higher education department for transgender community members, the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/soon-protocols-for-surgery-of-gender-reassignment/articleshow/84774977.cms||---

---||Delhi||Arrested in riots case for filing complaint against minister: Jamia alumnus||New Delhi: Shifa Ur Rehman, president of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) alumni association, alleged before a Delhi court on Monday that he was arrested in a northeast Delhi riots case under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act because he had made a complaint against a BJP minister. Rehman had made a complaint to the police against BJP functionaries Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Kapil Mishra, alleging that they made inflammatory speeches during the Delhi Assembly elections which led to violence at the university. Rehman, through his counsel, told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat that he was arrested for “extraneous reasons”. The court put up the matter for further hearing on August 3. Advocate Abhishek Singh, appearing for Rehman, claimed that since the very inception, the investigation has not been fair. “And there has been violation of his (Rehman’s) fundamental rights since the very beginning and he has been targeted. The attempt was to prevent him from getting legal advice at the right time,” Singh alleged. He referred to relevant sections of the UAPA which mandated that a review committee must do an independent review of the evidence gathered during investigation while granting the required sanctions to prosecute. He said that Delhi Police recommended sanction on July 28, 2020, but the report was submitted on July 30. He added the sanction must be granted only when the investigation was complete and the entire material has to be placed before the sanctioning committee but that was not the case here. “Was the investigation complete on this date? Was the evidence gathered by this date so that it could be reviewed? It’s a complete abuse of the process of law. It couldn’t have been completed on the said date. The prosecution committed the mistake of arresting me without any evidence… The sanction was granted when the investigation was not complete... I was vindictively arrested as I had made a complaint against a BJP minister,” Rehman’s counsel alleged. He claimed that the police was acting under the dictation of someone who had told them to grant the sanction. “The prosecution is acting under the dictation of someone. The grant of sanction was predetermined. Someone told them to do it and they did it. Nothing more, nothing else. There was complete abdication of responsibilities on the part of these authorities,” Singh further alleged. He said Rehman was not only entitled to bail but the case also has to be quashed. “The prosecution has tried to drown us in a sea of documents,” he said, referring to the over 17,000-page chargesheet filed in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/arrested-in-riots-case-for-filing-complaint-against-minister-jamia-alumnus/articleshow/84772732.cms||Usha Das
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rs 60 crore to be sanctioned for retaining walls at hill slopes||MUMBAI: The District Planning and Development Committee (DPDC) will sanction around Rs 60 crore for construction of retaining walls along vulnerable hill slopes in suburban Mumbai. The decision comes following a review meeting held by Mumbai suburban guardian minister and chairperson of DPDC Aaditya Thackeray on Monday. In the meeting, Thackeray called for sanctioning funds for hill slopes that urgently need retaining walls. In keeping with this directive, Mumbai suburban collector Milind Borikar has asked Mhada and BMC officials to conduct fresh site visits and make recommendations on sites that need urgent attention by Friday. “We will sanction the required funds for areas that need protection walls immediately based on this survey report,” Borikar said. “Chaired a meeting with Collector, Mumbai Suburban District and Assistant Commissioners of BMC that have landslide prone/ vulnerable informal housing in their wards. Reviewed the relief and repair operations for the 3 recent landslides in Chembur, Bhandup, Vikhroli. Expediting all pending backlog of landslide protection walls to keep no request pending by 2022-2023. Last year and this year also we have cleared maximum requests. Work on auditing the vulnerability of the region and alternate plans for the same,” Thackeray tweeted on Monday.  A 2010 survey by Mhada’s Slum Improvement Board and the BMC had revealed that close to 1 lakh families lived on hill slopes of Mumbai, of which around 22,483 were in dangerous or vulnerable zones. TOI had reported on Monday that around 4,000 families face the risk of landslides along the slopes of Mulund Hills between Bhandup and Mulund. The state government hasn’t sanctioned funds for constructing a retaining wall along the slopes to protect their homes since 2019. According to BJP MLA Mihir Kotecha, Mhada had created an estimate of around Rs 10.5 crore for building a retaining wall along the 2-km long hill slope, but only Rs 1.27 crore was sanctioned and a small portion of the wall was constructed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-60cr-to-be-sanctioned-for-retaining-walls-at-hill-slopes/articleshow/84776879.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The key post fell vacant after the demise of Indira Hridayesh on June 13. Talking to mediapersons on the day, Singh said, “My role has changed but the responsibility towards people remains the same. I will continue to raise the voice of the common man in the state assembly. We will highlight people-centric issues in the assembly sessions before the polls.” Meanwhile, Singh also criticised the incumbent BJP government and called its term in the office 'a failure on all fronts'. He said, “Centre has failed to check the prices of LPG cylinders and petroleum. In the state, the BJP government has failed to provide youths with employment opportunities and check migration. Further, the poor handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the government before the people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/my-role-has-changed-not-the-responsibility-pritam-singh/articleshow/84772432.cms||Kautilya Singh

According to the alert, "extremely heavy rainfall" is likely to occur at isolated places in Pithoragarh, Bageshwar, Nainital, Pauri and Dehradun districts on Tuesday. Along with the weather alert, the Met centre has also warned of medium to major landslides and rock falls at vulnerable places in the hilly districts between July 26 and 30. "People have been advised to remain extra cautious while travelling to the hills," according to a Met official. "Heavy to very heavy rainfall" lashed several parts of the state in the last 24 hours with Kotdwar in Pauri Garhwal district recording the maximum of 120mm rain, followed by 70mm showers at Narendra Nagar in Tehri district. The Rudraprayag-Gaurikund highway remained blocked for over nine hours after a landslide near Rampur-Nyalsu Road. The highway was cleared and reopened for traffic movement on Monday afternoon. Meanwhile, torrential rains in several districts of Kumaon damaged at least 10 motorable roads while destroying three houses. The most affected was Bageshwar district where the administration has alerted its officials asking them to remain at their official posting in case of any emergency. According to the data by Nainital district administration, four rural roads were closed on Monday. “We are maintaining a strict vigil and have alerted the Public Works Department (PWD) to repair the damaged road,” an official said. In Bageshwar district, four roads were blocked. According to district disaster management officer, Sikha Suyal, the PWD has been asked to clear the stretches. “We have information that three houses have also been damaged. Efforts are on to provide relief. No one is injured, so far. We have also released relief funds to the affected,” she said.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: No rise in undergraduate seats, no new subject amid pandemic||KOLKATA: The number of HS and ISC students scoring 90% and above has already exceeded 14,000, and CBSE is yet to publish its Class XII results. But universities and colleges in Bengal will not be able to increase a corresponding number of undergraduate seats due to the pandemic. Education minister Bratya Basu in the last meeting with vice-chancellors had instructed them to have a discussion with principals and inspectors of colleges and decide on seat rationalisation. “Despite our information, no college was ready to reduce seats or close departments due to the lack of takers. We did not get any such request either. The university can’t force affiliated colleges, which are governed by their BOG, to cut down on seats. But we will also not permit anyone to expand,” said a senior North Bengal University official. At none of the 152 colleges affiliated to Calcutta University, seats are being increased or new courses introduced this year. “We will not give any permission to increase the number of seats in CU colleges. No permission has been given to introduce new subjects. Despite receiving requests to open a few new colleges, we could not grant permission to any, barring one, in the 2021-22 academic session as inspection could not take place,” said a CU source. The state education department has neither received any application for introducing new subjects in the past one-and-a-half years nor has it been able to clear any pending application, as no inspection has been possible amid the pandemic. Many colleges did plan to apply for more seats in certain subjects but that has not happened as all campuses have been shut since March 2020. In HS 9,013 students scored 90% and above. Even if it’s considered that only 20% of ISC students have scored 90% and more, the two boards together would have more than 14,000 candidates in the high-scorer category. This, apart from CBSE students. The number of seats, especially in coveted subjects, fall far short. “The education department, universities and the colleges should have planned in advance, learning from last year’s experience. Since that has not happened, we might witness a similar chaos during admissions again,” said an education department official. Last year, 50% seats in 110 colleges in Bengal remained vacant. A couple of institutes reported 96%-74% vacancy. Even 67% vacancy was found in middle-tier colleges in 2020-21. The higher education department found out that some faculties at some colleges had no admission at all. As a result, VCs were told to hold virtual meetings with all their principals and inspectors to take a call on rationalizing seats. Last year, colleges struggled to fill seats in subjects, like philosophy, Sanskrit, Hindi and BCom general, while applications far exceeded the number of seats in English, history, geography, computer science, microbiology and chemistry. A consensus has been building in favour of seat rationalisation after principals reported that demand for certain subjects is much higher than others. The topic of seat rationalisation was also brought up in a meeting of principals last week. “Some subjects are much sought-after, while the demand for others is less,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-rise-in-ug-seats-no-new-subject-amid-pandemic/articleshow/84772543.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Nationalist Mahila Congress state vice-president Honey Victo, party state committee member Pradeep Kumar, Kundara block president Benedict and NCP Youth Congress Kollam president Biju were suspended from the party based on NCP’s enquiry report. The suspension, said NCP state president PC Chacko on Monday, was initiated against these leaders for sullying the good will of the party in front of the public. After NCP state office-bearers meeting, Chacko told reporters that Saseendran had intervened in the issue without knowing that the case pertained to sexual harassment. However, the party has instructed Saseendran to be more vigilant while making phone calls. According to NCP leadership, it was Honey Victo who circulated the petition filed by the complainant against an NCP leader at the police station. Kumar, using his close connection with the minister, pressed him to make the controversial phone call to the complainant’s father. It was Benedict who recorded his conversation with the minister and shared it with the media. Biju was suspended for his open criticism against the party in connection with the controversy. NCP leadership is also learnt to have decided to instil more discipline in party committees. As part of this, all memorandums to the minister would be routed only through the party state committee. Last week, Saseendran had admitted that he had called the father of the complainant without knowing that it was a harassment complaint. He had said that when he realized the seriousness of the case, he did not compel the father of the complainant to withdraw the complaint or settle the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ncp-takes-action-against-four-more-party-leaders/articleshow/84775054.cms||---

The complete charge-sheet is to be submitted within 180 days or the accused is entitled to bail. When the prosecution submitted the charge-sheet on the 180th day, the court ruled that it was incomplete. Granting bail to Goregaon based Mubaraq Sayyad, the special court said, “It is crystal clear the charge-sheet filed without CA report is incomplete and no cognizance can be taken. The prosecution opposed the bail plea and submitted that the chargesheet was filed within statutory period of 180 days and therefore question of releasing the accused did not arise. The prosecution also submitted that due to the pandemic, police authorities could not receive the CA report on time. Hence, chargesheet has been submitted without it. The court, however, referred to a recent Bombay High Court ruling in which it observed that the CA Report lays the foundation of the accused’s culpability, without which the court cannot form an opinion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-gets-bail-due-to-incomplete-charge-sheet/articleshow/84776953.cms||---

Siddiqui exports mangoes to countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Malaysia, the US and Japan. “The Bhutan embassy had requested for the mangoes, and they were bearing the cost of the transportation as well,” Siddiqui told TOI.

According to Siddiqui, “A consignment of one tonne of mangoes — comprising four varieties, including Langada, Chausa and Amrapali — was dispatched from Saharanpur to Delhi, from where the consignment would be dispatched to Bhutan by air. The mangoes will be distributed among locals in Bhutan during a festival.” “Bhutanese businessmen have, meanwhile, expressed their desire to do mango business with Amroha,” he said. Siddiqui said that the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic hit the export of Amroha mangoes. “This time, besides Bhutan, orders have also been received from Dubai.

While Cameron used advanced VFX to create these characters, known for their wild and fictional beauty, S Harikrishnan, a 23-year-old animation graduate from Kalavoor in Alappuzha, has made the miniature life-like 3D-models of them using M-Seal, a multi purpose sealant. Neytiri, Ikran and his other M-Seal models, including the one of Stephen Nedumpally played by Mohanlal in ‘Lucifer’, turn heads on social media and Harikrishnan is now busy making similar models of other famous movie characters. Besides M-Seal, Harikrishnan also uses thermocol and coconut shell to make models. Harikrishnan, who aspires to be an art director in film industry, has been passionate about drawing and modelling since childhood. However, his stint at professional modelling began only during the days at ICAT Design and Media College, Chennai. He created more than 35 large models out of thermocol for his college but he started using M-Seal only after learning the technique from Tamil art director T Muthuraj, after he attended a training workshop with him. “M-Seal proved to be a better medium than thermocol as it can be moulded into any shape easier. Creating a model of the Avatar characters was a dream as the movie is one of my favourites for its visual effects. It took me around two weeks to make Neytiri’s model and as it became a hit I decided to try Ikran too. Later, my friends insisted me to make Nedumpally’s model. Now, I am working on a model of Pazhassi Raja played by Mammooty in Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja. The models of Fahad Faasil and others too are planned,” Harikrishnan said. After the basic designs, he makes a skeleton of the figurine, covers it with M-Seal and does the paintings and final touches. Harikrishnan also uploads the making videos of his works on his YouTube channel Hari Tech Craft so that interested people can learn M-seal modelling. “Now, I am getting a lot of calls requesting to make models for their friends and beloved ones as gifts,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/alappuzha-youth-creates-magic-with-m-seal-craft/articleshow/84775118.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||Goa||Goa power minister Nilesh Cabral, AAP’s Satyendar Jain spar over 24x7 power for Goa||PANAJI: Challenging the Goa government to provide uninterrupted power supply, Delhi power minister Satyendar Jain on Monday assured Goa that the Aam Aadmi Party would ensure 24x7 power supply within two years. Insisting that uninterrupted power supply is not technically possible, Goa power minister Nilesh Cabral said that AAP was trying to hoodwink voters and create a vote bank. Jain caught Cabral on the wrong foot a couple of times, particularly when the minister said that Goa procures power from Chhattisgarh and Himachal Pradesh. The AAP minister also managed to get under Cabral’s skin by provoking the BJP neta with multiple references to the “buying and selling of MLAs” in Goa. “If AAP forms the government in the state, in the next two years we will show how 24x7 electricity will be provided,” said Jain. Cabral shot back and said Goa’s hilly topography makes it difficult to ensure continuous supply, particularly during the monsoons. “It is not that we are not trying to give power 24x7 in Goa. We are also doing it and it is only during the rainy season that the interruption starts,” said Cabral. “Goa will be bankrupt if free power is given to Goans. We cannot be a debt state.” The hyped face-off between Goa’s Cabral and his Delhi counterpart Jain was held at the Menezes Braganza hall in the state capital. While the debate drew in thousands of views online, the attendance at the venue was poor, with a huge posse of Goa police personnel keeping participants at bay. This is most likely the first time in India that power ministers of two different states or Union territories have engaged in a public debate. Cabral said that the state government is working towards uninterrupted power supply. “There are two types of disruptions, one is at the distribution side and the other is at the incoming side. Within the next two to three years, because it takes time, we will be able to have uninterrupted power. We cannot give free power. We can give subsidised power,” said Cabral. Jain said that Cabral was only making excuses. AAP’s promise to give free power to consumers who consume up to 300 units of power did raise concerns about the impact it would have on Goa’s precarious state treasury. Unlike the Delhi government which has a high GST revenue collection, Goa’s revenue is on the decline. Cabral said that unlike the Delhi power model which subsidises low consumption users, Goa subsidises all consumers by keeping electricity tariffs low. In Delhi, bills for consumption of up to 200 units of electricity are waived off while consumption between 200 and 400 units of electricity is given a 50% discount. The tariff slabs in Delhi vary from Rs 3 per unit to Rs 8 per unit while in Goa the highest tariff is Rs 4 per unit. Jain said that power tariff slabs would not be increased if AAP forms the government. He said that money saved by drastically reducing transmission losses will help cover up the 300 free units of power given to people. Countering the BJP’s claim that only Delhi residents with second homes in Goa will benefit from the 300 free units, Jain said that all those consuming less than 300 units should vote for AAP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabral-aaps-jain-spar-over-24x7-power-for-goa/articleshow/84775089.cms||---

The figures released by the state water resources department said the total water available in these dams was 4,414 million cubic metres (MCM) against a total capacity of 12,626 MCM. Jaipur and Jodhpur divisions have below state average stocks in their dams with 13.9% and 4.5%, respectively. Incessant rains in Kota and Udaipur division have filled some of their dams above 60% in the past two weeks. Kota Barrage is the only dam that has crossed 94% capacity. Experts said the barrage would overflow in the coming days. Pacholas dam in Sawai Madhopur is 92.62% filled while Gagarin dam in Jhalawar has 80.65% water. Ana Sagar dam in Ajmer is currently 75.12% filled. Jaipur district has barely 15% water in its dams with the highest 64% in Kanota while there is 60% in Nevta dam. “The rest six dams have zero per cent water making it difficult for the local authorities to meet the demand for the year,” said an official at the water resource department. Experts said rains in August and September last year had filled the dams and waterbodies. “Last year it rained heavily in the last two spells. It was an exception and it doesn’t mean that it will rain this year too in the last spells. Data from the drought year says the same pattern is being repeated this year. Maximum rains occur in July, which has recorded way below the average rains this year,” said Reepunjay Singh, professor of urban planning at Rajasthan Institute of Public Administration. Experts have warned that if poor rainfall continues this year, it will impact the water supply in all categories—irrigation, domestic purposes, industrial and livestock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dams-have-only-34-water-drought-cant-be-ruled-ou/articleshow/84775088.cms||Shoeb Khan

The waterfall, which is now named Bison Waterfall, was discovered in Ginnedhari forest range by the forester a few days ago and is about 2km from the popular Gundala waterfalls. Ginnedhari forest range officer (FRO) Thodishetty Pranay said he spotted the waterfall while perambulating in the forest. “While I was patrolling the area I happened to take a new route to see what lies ahead. After trekking for about 5km, I was surprised to discover this natural wonder that cascades down from around 60 meters.” The FRO said even the tribal population in the area said they were unaware of the spot when he enquired with them. “We decided to name it Bison Waterfall after noticing a huge rock adjacent to it resembling the head of a bison. There is also a deep gorge suitable for adventure tourism and can be added to the adventure tourism circuit of Asifabad forest division by taking some precautions to ensure there is no negative impact on local environment,” said Pranay. Tiryani forest has Chicharaloddi, Chintala Madara, Pilligundam and many other seasonal waterfalls. This apart, the forest areas of Kumaram Bheem Asifabad district are primarily known for the presence of tiger population, some rare species of birds among other flora and fauna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/forester-finds-new-waterfall-in-asifabad/articleshow/84775070.cms||Moulika.KV

---||Mumbai||Queue for second shot swells, BMC eyes CSR aid for stocks||MUMBAI: Public centres grappling with vaccine shortage have hundreds lining up daily while private hospitals sitting on thousands of doses have few takers. This paradox has prompted civic authorities to explore the CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) route through tie-ups with private facilities, corporates and NGOs to broaden immunisation coverage in slums. Guardian minister Aditya Thackeray who chaired a meeting on Monday with commissioner IS Chahal said the corporation must explore such avenues. The BMC has not been able to procure vaccines on its own despite floating tenders. “Efforts should be made to make vaccine stocks available through non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as corporate social responsibility funds,” said Thackeray, adding that awareness campaigns for those who want to take a second dose should be undertaken as well. The need to spread the net for vaccines has arisen out of an exercise undertaken by the BMC to assess the number turning eligible for a second shot every day. By that calculation, thousands in the city will start qualifying for the second dose this week onwards—majority in the 18-44 group, who started getting doses on May 1. On July 29, 15,000 will qualify for a second dose. On subsequent days too, an equal number will be eligible. So far, 2,500-5,000 were turning eligible for the second Covishield shot daily. Additional municipal commission Suresh Kakani had told TOI that a few private hospitals have shown willingness to donate doses for slum dwellers. Discussions are on with Godrej Hospital in Vikhroli and Jaslok at Peddar Road apart from a few NGOs, said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer. “They are willing to donate about 1lakh doses each, but we are still sorting out the fine details,” she said. Dr Gomare said the daily list of second dose beneficiaries will be shared with the state and the Centre to press for more doses. Efforts are also being made at the ward level to raise funds for vaccines. Officials from the G South ward are believed to have raised funds to procure 2,000 doses at the least. Some vaccination through the CSR initiative is already underway. Surana Group of Hospitals, for instance, is vaccinating slum dwellers in Dharavi and Worli with support from ICICI Lombard, a civic official said. So far 15,000 have been covered and another 27,000 doses are in the pipeline. A Prabhadevi resident told TOI her house help has failed to get vaccinated despite trying three times in the last few weeks. “Due to the shortage, most free centres have only 100-200 slots which is forcing people to wait in the queue since 4am,” the resident added. BJP corporator Atul Shah, who is coordinating with the civic vaccination centre at the Madhav Baug Temple compound at Bhuleshwar, said locals are disheartened when they come to the centre and have to return without getting a shot. As on July 24, a total 67.25lakh doses have been administered in the city. Nearly 16lakh have got both doses while 51.50 lakh have taken the first dose. The city has an estimated adult population of 93lakh.

The 17-year-old girl's father, a farmer, caught her leaving and tried to stop her. It was 4 am then. The father, in a fit of rage, killed her with a country-made pistol when she refused to stay back. After the crime, he was about to leave the house, but his wife called the police and got him arrested. The incident occurred at Paroli village under the Bilsi police limits. Police said he has confessed to have killed his daughter, and was booked under IPC section 302 [murder] on his wife’s complaint at Bilsi police station. Section 3/25 of the Arms Act has also been slapped against him for carrying a country-made pistol. The girl’s body has been sent for autopsy. The girl was a school dropout. She was reportedly in a relationship with the local youth, 21, for two years. Both were from the same community. The young couple wanted to get married and when the girl spoke to her father, he firmly turned it down. Instead, he forced her to stay inside the house. The girl's mother, however, was not against the relationship, but couldn't convince her husband. After being forced to stay indoors for over a month, the girl decided to run away with her boyfriend on Monday. When contacted, Bilsi circle officer, Anirudha Singh, told TOI, “The man killed his daughter to save the family's honour. He has been arrested and sent to jail after his wife's complaint. In fact, she was a witness to the crime. We have also recorded the statement of neighbours.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/girl-17-shot-dead-by-dad-after-she-tries-to-elope-with-her-friend-in-ups-budaun/articleshow/84763093.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Kolkata||West Bengal varsities struggle to provide level playing admission field||KOLKATA: Only a week is left for undergraduate applications to begin but universities and colleges are still trying to find a measure that will ensure seat justice for meritorious students and high academic standards for institutes. So far, the state has ruled out any interview or entrance test for UG admissions. The Arts faculty at Jadavpur University has proposed an online interaction with candidates before drawing up the merit list to get an idea of their aptitude in subjects applied for. They are not keen on depending solely on the boards’ and councils’ formulae. The proposal will be shared with vice-chancellor Suranjan Das shortly. “We have requested for virtual discussions, giving meeting slots and time to candidates. In case of weak internet connection, students can request for one-on-one discussion on phone,” said head of comparative literature Sujit Kumar Mondal. Dean of Arts Madhumita Chattopadhyay said she had received requests from multiple HoDs for virtual meets with candidates but this had to be cleared by the VC. The English department proposed a formula of 50% weightage to Class XII aggregate, 25% to the language group and 25% weightage to English scores in Class X boards. “This way, we hope to check whether a student is ready to study literature or not,” said Sonia Sahoo, HoD. JU science professors have proposed a formula, under which at least 20% weightage will be given to online interaction. Colleges and universities are worried lack of screening might lead to admitting students in subjects they don’t have the knack for. This, they say, will not only deny deserving students seats but institutes will also lose academic credibility. St Xavier’s College has published its formulae, under which 75% weightage is being given to the applied subject+aggregate and 25% to the subject alone. But shortlisted candidates will be required to have online discussions with faculty members. “This will help them choose subjects. There will be separate group meetings for subjects,” said principal Father Dominic Savio. A meeting of the admission committee at Presidency University is slated for this week. A section of the faculty wants screening. A formula is being worked out, factoring in Class X boards and Class XII results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/varsities-struggle-to-provide-level-playing-admission-field/articleshow/84772951.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Jaipur||Make contingency plan for agriculture, drinking water: Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has asked the officials of agriculture, PHED and disaster management to prepare a contingency plan for eventuality of a below average rain fall in the current monsoon season. Gehlot, during a reviewing, said that except Pratapgarh and Jaisalmer, almost all districts have received less than normal rainfall till now. But he is hopeful that this situation will improve in the coming days. He said that even then, all preparations should be made for disaster management in case of drought or floods. Contingency funds have been transferred to the district collectors with instructions to prepare them for drinking water, rain-related accidents, floods or drought. As against the average rainfall of 210mm by July 25, only 141mm of rainfall has been reported in the state. Gehlot said that to promote water conservation, rainwater harvesting structures in residential and other buildings need to be taken up in a big way. He said the stipulation of water harvesting structures should be made mandatory from 100-yard buildings instead of 300-yard at present. He said that priority needs to be given to Jal Jeevan Mission to provide piped water to every household. Public Health Engineering minister BD Kalla said that water conservation works need to be given priority. For this, efforts should be made to conserve water and increase the groundwater level by making rainwater harvesting structures in buildings. He added that emphasis should be laid on motivating farmers to adopt drip and sprinkler irrigation systems to save water in the agriculture sector. Agriculture and animal husbandry minister Lalchand Kataria said that due to delay in rains, sowing of crops has reduced. But it is expected to improve with the forecast of good rains in the coming days. On behalf of the department, farmers are being advised to sow crops that need less time and water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/make-contingency-plan-for-agriculture-drinking-water-cm/articleshow/84775122.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Four held for raping two minors in Benaulim||COLVA: Two minor girls were raped by four youths posing as policemen at Benaulim beach early on Sunday. The accused, Asif Hateli, 21, of housing board-Margao, Rajesh Mane, 33, Gajanand Chinchankar, 31, and Nitin Yabbal, 19, all from Zariwadi-Davorlim, who were arrested by Colva police on Sunday night, had also threatened to upload photos of the incident on social media platforms if they weren’t paid Rs 65,000. Sources said a group of four girls and six boys — including the two minor survivors and a minor boy — visited Benaulim beach at 11.30pm on Saturday. Part of the group had left the beach early due to inclement weather, leaving three boys and the two minor girls behind. As the girls approached their car at 3.30am, the four accused confronted them. Posing as policemen — one was even carrying a danda — they threatened to arrest the group of youngsters. They subsequently slapped the three boys, threw alcohol into the eyes of one of them, and molested the girls. One of the accused reportedly dragged one of the two girls into the car, but she managed to open the door and flee to the beach. The accused, however, caught up with her, dragged her into vegetation along the shore, and raped her. Another accused carried the second girl to an isolated spot, where he raped her. The group was then allowed to go home. By noon on Sunday, one of the boys received a call demanding payment of Rs 40,000 before the end of July and another Rs 25,000 in the following month. He was told that if the money wasn’t received, pictures of the incident would be posted on social media platforms. When the two survivors learnt of this, they decided to lodge a police complaint. It helped that one of the victim boys had recognised one of the accused. All four accused were rounded up by Colva police on Sunday night and were booked under provisions of the IPC, Pocso Act and the Goa Children’s Act. They were produced before the magistrate who remanded them in four days police custody. Colva police inspector Anand Shirodkar said investigation is under way.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Collector’s permit for camel transport may be scrapped||JAIPUR: Rajasthan animal husbandry department has sent a proposal to the cabinet for removing the permit of collector, which is necessary for inter-state transportation of camels. This is a long-pending demand of camel herders and breeders in the state, which they feel is necessary to improve the declining camel population. In the Rajasthan Camel (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Bill, 2015, any person who wants to take a camel out of state for agriculture, breeding or to participate in animal fairs, has to get permission from the district collector. This has impacted the Rebari community, who are traditional camel breeders and herders, who take long tours for grazing camels in other states. Rebari are a nomadic community and have little knowledge of government mechanism, which makes it difficult for them to get a permit. Hence, camel transportation ban impacted their livelihood and they are now abandoning them. Arushi Malik, secretary to the government of Rajasthan animal husbandry department said, “A sub-committee that was formed to study this issue has sent a proposal to the cabinet to remove the ban. This will empower the people in the state and help improve camel population. Once cabinet approves it, the proposal will be sent to the President and later will be placed in the next assembly session.” In the decadal livestock census published in 2019, there has been a 34% decline in camel population in the state since 2012. This is said to be a cause of concern and transportation ban is said to be the reason for it. Hanwant Singh, a member of Lok Hit Pashupalak Sansthan, said due to the transportation ban, Rebari community has been hit the most. “Rebari cannot take them to Gujarat or other states for grazing nor for any fairs. The importance of camel as desert transport has already been lost. Now, camels are sold for Rs 5,000 in Rajasthan instead of Rs 20,000. We really hope this proposal is approved or else there will be a day when Rajasthan won’t have any camels,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/collectors-permit-for-camel-transport-may-be-scrapped/articleshow/84775096.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘No Covid infection due to organ transplants during the pandemic’||Mumbai: In what could be reassuring for patients waiting for organ transplants, the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC) that distributes cadaver organs has now collated data to show that with appropriate protocols, transplants can be carried out with no increased risk of contracting Covid. It has analysed all 87 transplants carried out in the pandemic period—36 between March and December 2020 and 51 in 2021—and found not a single infection among recipients or healthcare workers. In this period, there have been 40 kidney transplants, 23 liver transplants, 15 heart transplants, and six lung transplants, all facilitated by cadaver donations.“We didn’t see Covid infections after any of the transplants. In the light of this data, hospitals must make efforts to restart their programmes as lives are at stake. There is no data to suggest either recipients or health workers being at risk,” said Dr S K Mathur, president, ZTCC. He added that people living with end stage organ failure face an equal risk of suffering from Covid-19 complications as those with other comorbidities.After last year’s drastic drop, cadaver donations had begun to pick up between January and March before the second wave hit in April. Transplant coordinators, however, say it’s not simply the fear of infections but several logistical problems that have been holding back the programme. “Primarily, the conversion of ICUs for Covid has brought down admissions with head injuries or strokes,” said one of the transplant coordinators. A decline in road accidents too has reduced the number of potential donors. Nephrologist Dr Bharat Shah said that in a few cases, even recipients refused to undergo the transplant fearing Covid.But in some hospitals, things have begun to look up. Dr Satish Javali, cardiothoracic surgeon at Fortis Hospital, said they have started getting calls from people wanting to donate. After 39 heart transplants in 2019, the hospital could perform only one lung transplant in 2020 and one heart transplant in 2021. “We have one adult and three children urgently in need of donor hearts,” he said. “We have begun to get some calls from people wanting to donate. That’s a good sign,” he said. Patel, who is also raising funds for the transplant, is hopeful that his son will find a donor sooner than later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-covid-infection-due-to-organ-transplants-during-the-pandemic/articleshow/84775162.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Truck and after truck, carrying loads of construction material mined from Yamuna river bed in Haryana’s Yamuna Nagar district, have been sneaking into UP for the last several months, throwing the legal miners out of business.The illegally acquired material from Haryana is sold at cheap rates in UP, which the legal miners -- who purchase the material from the government-- cannot offer.Bhupender Bisht, a miner from Saharanpur, said, “On an average, we purchase uncrushed stones from the UP government at Rs 22/ quintal. Then we spend another Rs 18/quintal in crushing, fuel and in its transportation. So the total cost comes at around Rs 40/ quintal. Now selling anything above that is our profit. But Haryana-based mafia sells it at around Rs 30/quintal and still make huge profit.”After complaints from the miners, the government has now launched a crackdown.UP’s special secretary and director of geology and mining Dr Roshan Jacob has shot off letter to the district magistrates of Saharanpur, Shamli, Baghpat and Muzaffarnagar directing them to take steps and stop entry of trucks containing mining materials from Haryana for sale. All the four districts share border with Haryana.“It has come to our notice that hundreds of stone crushers are generating construction material from illegal mining activity on Yamuna in Yamuna Nagar district of Haryana. The mafia, in order to make it look legal, creates bogus purchase bills of raw material (stones) from other states. Using fictitious papers, the construction material finds its way into UP. It needs to be stopped,” the letter said.After receiving complaints from legal miners in UP, Jacob had instituted an inquiry and sent a team to Saharanpur. “There was indeed movement of material from Haryana to UP using fake documents, a discrepancy which was confirmed by the office of director general of mines and geology, Haryana in its report,” the inquiry said.When contacted, district magistrate (DM) of Shamli, Jasjeet Kaur, said, “We have begun taking action in this matter. Mining is closed during monsoon but we have plans to install CCTV cameras on the sensitive entry points into state. Mobile teams have also been constituted which will keep an eye on such illegal movement.”According to the report of the director general of mines and geology, Haryana, accessed by TOI, 63 entities all across Haryana, including 38 stone crushers and 23 screening plants, have been identified as the ones claiming to buy minerals from outside states like Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Karnataka, Goa, Andaman etc.While the report says, “It is clear that any transportation of mineral from faraway states other than adjoining states is neither practically possible nor economically feasible. Hence the mineral being shown as procured from such states are fake and falls under the case of fraud with the state government.”According to district magistrate of Baghpat, Raj Kamal Yadav, “A list of more than 60 entities who are involved in the illegal trade have been sent to us. Any consignment moving into UP that belongs to any of these entities will certainly be stopped.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-clampdowns-on-haryanas-mining-mafia-as-cheap-illegal-construction-material-floods-markets/articleshow/84763284.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Plans afoot to make Chambal river clean||JAIPUR: Aquatic life in Chambal river in Rajasthan is expected to get a fresh lease as rejuvenation plans are afoot on the lines of the Ganga. The river, which is home to critically endangered gharial and rare species of dolphins, crocodiles, nine species of turtles and many others, will be conserved under the Namami Gange Programme. For the same, Wildlife Institute of India (WII) on Monday organised a workshop on ‘Planning and Management for Conservation of Aquatic Species and Maintenance of Ecosystem in Ganga River Basin’. An senior official said, “With the help of the Union ministry of jal shakti and the WII, the government has made a plan to save the Chambal, the only river flowing throughout the year in Rajasthan.” Once the proposal is initiated, strong attention will be given to reduce pollution in the river. Also, there will be a crackdown on illegal mining in areas where these aquatic creatures are found in large numbers. Dr Ruchi Badola, scientist of WII said the National Mission for Clean Ganga has been set up to keep the Ganga clean that passes through five states of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Chambal river is its important link. Addressing the workshop, Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, director general, National Mission for Clean Ganga, stressed that Chambal river is an important river of the Ganges basin.

In an exclusive conversation with TOI, Mukherjee reiterated “In no other wars fought by India prior to Kargil or wars fought by Israel or even in the Vietnam war, the recovery rate of soldiers injured in the battlefield was higher. It is well documented that the morale of soldiers determines the outcomes of war, and one of the major factors in boosting the morale of men on the battlefield is the assurance of prompt medical care.” “In Kargil, the innovation and improvisation—a set of skills which is unique to the armed forces medical branch—helped save many lives. A strong foundation of clinical medical professional acumen is required to deliver medical care in war situations. The story of Col Rajesh Adhau, one of the most decorated doctors who has served in wars, is an example. He braved bullets in the battlefield and tirelessly managed to take out many soldiers alive who had suffered grave injuries,” said Mukherjee who was wing-commander of Indian Air Force posted in western air-command during Kargil war. Later, he joined the army. In the 53-day war, 97 soldiers were treated amid the shelling and fire exchange on the high altitude of Kargil battlefield by Col Adhau, who had only one-year of experience of serving in the army prior to the war. He was Captain back then. During Kargil, Col Rajesh Adhau had served under the then commanding officer Yogesh Kumar Joshi of 13 JAK, who is currently GOC-in-chief of northern command. In the picture from left to right PVC Captain Vikram Batra, Major Vohra, the then Captain (Dr) Rajesh Adhau and the then Colonel Yogesh Kumar Joshi In Kargil, 571 soldiers including officers were killed, while around 1,100 were injured. “Out of the 14 soldiers who were killed in Col Adhau’s presence, nine had suffered direct bullet hits in their head and died on the spot. Before the soldiers were marched to Kargil, Adhau had briefed 13 JAK men at Sopore that he would be just five minutes away when any of them got wounded. He kept his word and saved 97 men’s lives, including the then captain Naveen Nagappa, who was wounded in the grenade blast, but PVC captain Vikram Batra pulled him to safety before running back to assault the enemy bunkers,” said an army officer. Hailing from Talegaon village of Baroda, Gujarat, Adhau was regimental medical officer (RMO) of 13JAK. He is one of the rare doctors to be awarded a gallantry Sena medal for service in the battlefield. Posted in Delhi, the officer was also involved in Covid duty. “Apart from our skills as doctor, it’s the passion to care about patient—be it Kargil battlefield amid the enemy artillery shellings or Covid patient, helped us achieve high success rate in terms of patients recovery—Kargil war is the biggest example of maximum recovered soldiers who suffered bullet and splinter injuries,” Col Adhau told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/recovery-rate-of-injured-kargil-soldiers-was-highest/articleshow/84775248.cms||Arvind Chauhan

---||Jodhpur||Rajasthan: 11 minors held for disrespecting graves to bring rain in Barmer||JAISALMER: Eleven minor boys of a village were taken into custody on Monday for disrespecting the graves belonging to Meghwal community. A video showing young boys beating some graves with shoes, sticks and sprinkling salt on them went viral under Barmer’s Girab police station area, after which the police got into action. The boys were doing this as they believed that the spirits of the dead were holding back rain and by doing this their area would get showers. The Meghwal community, in Barmer and Jaisalmer, buries the dead. A case has also been lodged and investigation is on. After this incident, there is resentment in the community, which is demanding strict action against the culprits. SHO Mahesh Dhaka on getting the information visited the spot. Barmer SP Anand Sharma, confirming the incident, said that a few days ago some mischievous minors aged 10-16 years created ruckus at the graves of recently buried bodies. A video was shot of the incident. Later a song was added to it and it was posted on social media. Sharma said that the moment they received information about the incident they took the boys in custody and an inquiry was initiated. In the inquiry, the minors said that it was not raining in their village and nearby areas. They believed that the spirits of the deceased of the Meghwal community who were recently buried were stopping the rain. Hence, to drive away the spirits they resorted to this. SP Sharma said they are inquiring as to who provoked these boys and who made them do this. A case has been lodged under Section 297 of the SC/ST Act and other sections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/11-minors-held-for-disrespecting-graves-to-bring-rain-in-barmer/articleshow/84775204.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC slams Bar Council order that led to nixing Mumbai University’s law results||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Monday lambasted the Bar Council of India for its directive to Mumbai University that resulted in cancellation of results of various semesters of the LLB programme. “We are of prima facie view that results having already been declared on May 22, 2020, in respect of various semesters could not have been withdrawn and students could not have been directed to submit assignments for the purpose of further evaluation,” said a bench of Justices Ramesh Dhanuka and Riyaz Chagla on a petition by Latoya Ferns, a final-year student of Government Law College. Her advocate, Shashank Sudir, argued results that are declared cannot be cancelled and substituted with assignment-based evaluation as prescribed by Mumbai University’s July 5 circular. Also, the assignments have to be submitted in 21 days without online classes. BCI’s advocate Amit Sale said Advocates Act, 1971, empowers it to make rules for legal education. “Does it say cancel existing results and call for assignments?” asked Justice Dhanuka. Mumbai University’s advocate Ashutosh Kulkarni said its circular was based on BCI’s June 10 press release. Also, among 10,000 students only Latoya is aggrieved with the time limit for assignments, he argued. The judges said they could understand if it were final exams and not intermediate exams. “The direction has to be prospective. How can you set it back?” asked Justice Chagla. Justice Dhanuka said, “You (BCI) consider or we’ll grant a stay of this (MU) circular,’’ said Justice Dhanuka. In their order, the judges said BCI could not justify how the results already declared and communicated to the students, “can be withdrawn unilaterally with retrospective effect”. On July 28, BCI will inform if its directive “can be withdrawn or modified in view of the fact that the results are declared way back on May 22, 2020, and to restore the results already declared on May 22, 2020, or not”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-slams-bar-council-order-that-led-to-nixing-mum-univs-law-results/articleshow/84770113.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Bengaluru||BS Yediyurappa resigns as Karnataka CM, vows to work for party in state||BENGALURU: Ending months of speculation over a leadership change in Karnataka, chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday announced his resignation in an emotional speech during an event to commemorate two years of his government in the state. Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot accepted Yediyurappa’s resignation and asked him to continue as caretaker chief minister till the next CM is sworn in. The Lingayat strongman’s decision to step aside sets the stage for a new era in Karnataka politics and for BJP in particular as the party’s fortunes so far have been wedded to BSY’s rise in the southern state. Hours after he resigned, the BJP high command announced a team of observers led by Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan to head to Bengaluru who will oversee a meeting of the legislature party to elect the next chief minister. Senior party sources indicated the choice will from the current crop of legislators. “The parliamentary board of BJP will decide the next CM on Tuesday and later it will be announced in the legislature party meeting,” BJP national general secretary and Karnataka in-charge Arun Singh said in Delhi. None pressured me to resign: YediyurappaIt is yet to be known who will succeed the veteran Lingayat leader with several names doing the rounds and most of the party’s senior leadership in the state throwing their hats into the ring. Choosing a successor will be a test as influential Lingayat mutts have protested BSY’s resignation, and the community is key to BJP’s electoral strength in the state. But the BJP high command seems to have succeeded in co-opting Yediyurappa’s support for his successor and staved off the possibility of a miffed ex-CM playing spoilsport by sulking on the sidelines . TOI had reported the impending change of guard in its edition dated July 18. Speculation is rife that names from the Lingayat community as well as non-Lingayats who have strong Hindutva leanings are being considered. Among Lingayats, Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, Arvind Bellad and Basavaraj Bommai are being mentioned; BL Santosh, Visveshwara Hedge Kageri and CT Ravi are some other names doing the rounds. Yediyurappa said, “Nobody pressured me to resign. I did it on my own so that someone else can take over as CM after the completion of two years of government. I’ll work to bring BJP back in power in the next election. I've not given the name of anyone who should succeed me.” He also assured that he and his supporters would give their 100% to whoever is the next chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bsy-resigns-as-cm-vows-to-work-for-party-in-state/articleshow/84778250.cms||---

The woman in her FIR on Sunday said the youth raped her in the pretext of getting her a job and with the promise of marrying her later. According to police, the woman said she had come to Jaipur to prepare for competitive examinations and took a rented accommodation with her brother almost 18 months ago “Almost an year ago, she met the youth identified as Ravi (24) who promised her to get a job and gradually came closer to her. Ravi raped her and asked her to keep mum,” said a police officer while quoting the FIR. Police said since the girl was silent, the accused took her to his uncle who also raped her. “In the FIR, she said the youth’s uncle arrived at her rented accommodation one day and raped her. Initially she was scared, but later decided to lodge an FIR,” said the officer. Police said there are a few unanswered questions. “We have to find out if it was a rape or physical relation with the youth with her consent. Also, if she was raped a year ago for the first time, why was she silent? We will record her statements and take her for medical examination,” the officer added.

---||Kolkata||Health panel bars 2 hosps from admitting new patients||Kolkata: The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) has barred two nursing homes — one in Belgharia and another in Howrah — from admitting new patients. The decision was taken on Monday following complaints against the two facilities and findings by the health commission. In the first case, the family of a Covid victim had complained about the qualification of the RMO and the ICU nurse at Midland Nursing Home. The commission found that the RMO had obtained his medical graduation degree from a Russian institute and later passed the mandatory MCI screening that allowed him to practise in India. But while he passed the screening test in June, he had already been posted as an RMO in April — when the patient died. WBCERC also found the ICU nurse was still undergoing a distance education training from a Bangalore institute. “We have asked the nursing home to stop admitting new patients till our team inspects and gives a further notice. The hospital has also been asked to deposit Rs 2 lakh as fixed deposit in the name of the 10-year-old son of the deceased,” said WBCERC chairman Justice (retired) Ashim Kumar Banerjee. At the Life Care Nursing Home in Howrah, the family of a deceased alleged that the patient’s death certificate was signed by a homeopath and that an Ayurva specialist was deputed to treat the patient who was critical. The patient had been admitted under an allopath. “We have asked the CMOH Howrah to investigate. The nursing home has been barred from admitting any new patient till the probe is over,” said Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/health-panel-bars-2-hosps-from-admitting-new-patients/articleshow/84772756.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

On Monday, chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) Dr Pankaj Sharma directed the investigating officer to file a status report on further investigation on the next date of hearing. During the hearing, advocate Jaspreet Singh Rai, appearing for Sirsa, moved an application claiming that Singh had misled the court with an ulterior motive of deterring him in lieu of elections. “A progress report has been filed by the IO stating that LOC against Sirsa has been opened and investigation is in progress. Counsel (for Sirsa) submitted that Bhupinder Singh has misled the court through his application where false and frivolous information has been tendered,” said CMM Sharma. Rai added that the complainant was trying to defame Sirsa, who was the current president of DSGMC. “In the status report, IO has stated that Sirsa has fully cooperated in the investigation. During Covid times, he had established a 400-bed hospital in Rakab Ganj Gurdwara in no time and was there every day managing meals for the patients. His stand all through has been that the matter should be investigated… A process is being abused just to put some muck on somebody,” Rai alleged. Advocate Sanjay Abbot, appearing for the complainant, had claimed that Sirsa was in the process of selling his properties and fleeing as soon as the flight operations resumed. He added that police had not taken appropriate steps to prevent him from fleeing. Police had submitted before the court that allegations of unjustified payments from Golak Funds to M/s Raja Tent & Decorators and other companies were being probed. The investigating officer also said that misappropriation of funds of the gurdwara through bogus bills was also under probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lookout-circular-issued-against-sirsa-in-fraud-case-police-tell-court/articleshow/84772760.cms||Usha Das

The incident took place at 1 am at Gohri range of Rajaji Tiger Reserve (RTR). The other man ran for his life and later informed the forest guards. The forest officials claimed that Manish Dobriyal, the victim, was probably drunk and crossing through the forest area of Neelkanth-Kandi Road. Dobriyal was a resident of Satpuli in Pauri Garhwal and was working at a resort. Forest officials said that he was "careless". Forest guards tried to stop him from using the road as they knew that there was elephant movement, but he refused to listen to them, said Dheer Singh, range officer, Gohri range, RTR. “The jumbo killed him on the spot while the pillion rider fled and informed the forest guards,” Singh added. Earlier, in March, a 55-year-old was trampled by an elephant on a rampage. And on February 22, another person was killed at Phoolchatti Road near a shrine. This is the fifth human-elephant conflict death in the state so far, according to the forest department. The frontline forest staff had demanded additional patrolling to prevent the rising human-elephant conflict. Forest department had even tried radio-collaring around a dozen rogue elephants in the past. The area is a part of Shivalik Elephant Reserve which houses over 2,000 elephants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/biker-27-trampled-to-death-by-tusker-in-rajaji-tiger-reserve/articleshow/84772755.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Jaipur||Postal service officer suspended a month after being held for bribe||JAIPUR: The department of personnel (DOP) on Monday issued an order to suspend Indian Postal Service (IPoS) officer Prateek Jhajharia from the post of labour commissioner under Rule 10 (2) (A) of central civil services (classification, control and appeal) rules, 1965. Jhajharia was arrested by anti-corruption bureau (ACB) after he was caught red handed while taking a bribe of Rs 3 lakh from two agents at his Gandhi Nagar residence late on June 26. As per Rule 10(2)(A) of central civil services (classification, control and appeal) rules, 1965, a government servant shall be deemed to have been placed under suspension by an order of appointing authority - with effect from the date of his detention, if he is detained in custody, whether on a criminal charge or otherwise, for a period exceeding forty-eight hours. Jhajharia was removed as managing director of RSLDC in July last year. After receiving complaints from the employees, skill and employment minister Ashok Chandna had constituted a probe committee to investigate alleged irregularities and anomalies in Rajasthan Skill And Livelihoods Development Corporation (RSLDC), functioning of the corporation and expenditures/payments made in the recent past. Earlier, the minister had directed that the “chairman of RSLDC (Pawan) would be the final authority for clearance of files till the probe was completed”, diluting certain powers of RSLDC managing director Jhajharia. It was decided that all files pertaining to the department must either reach the minister or the chairman of RSLDC for clearance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/postal-service-officer-suspended-a-month-after-being-held-for-bribe/articleshow/84775284.cms||---

The last time the city had less than 300 cases in a day was on April 24, 2020 (242), at the start of the first wave. At the state level too, fewer than 5,000 daily cases (4,877) were added, taking the Covid tally so far to 63.7 lakh. The state’s daily tally was last below 5,000 on February 17 (4,787) this year, before the second wave began. The daily toll dipped to 53 deaths in Maharashtra, including 8 in Mumbai. Experts said the low cases could be a combination of two or three factors -- low testing on Sundays (results are tallied a day later), natural decline of the second wave and/or “monsoon masking” of the real numbers. With at least eight districts affected by floods and some others receiving heavy rainfall, Covid testing has taken a back-seat. The daily tests in Maharashtra over the weekend were 1.48 lakh as against the daily average of 2.2-2.3 lakh, while Mumbai saw 24,989 tests as against 30,000-plus daily. AMC Suresh Kakani said the second wave is under control at the moment. “Most cases are scattered, and there is no cluster developing anywhere in the city,” he said. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state task force, said the low numbers could be an indicator the “thick tail” of Maharashtra is reducing. “But there could also be a ‘monsoon masking’ of cases. With rains and floods, fewer people are being tested,” he added. With cases dropping, the state is expected to take a decision to ease restrictions this week. Officials said shop timings may be increased to beyond 4 pm, and weekend curbs on dine-in restaurants and keeping non-essential shops open are set to be lifted. The state is also considering allowing malls to be opened up in a restricted manner. “A decision was to be taken last week, but was put off due to the heavy rain across the state,” said a senior official. More sectors may be allowed for train travel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-citys-daily-covid-cases-lowest-since-april-2020/articleshow/84775291.cms||Malathy Iyer

It was formed to prepare strategies and policies to develop a more environment friendly public transportation system in New Town . “We had our first meeting on Monday. We will be taking a 360 degree view on the present public transport system to get a proper perspective towards developing a more environment and climate friendly transportation system in New Town. Surveys will be conducted and plans would be chalked out as to what more ideas could be conceptualised to prepare a masterplan on this,” said Hidco and NKDA chairman Debashis Sen. Officials said a thorough survey would be conducted on the present public transport system. “It would cover different categories of people, including the low, middle and higher income groups as to what public transport they usually avail of to travel and what kind of vehicles they normally use to reach their workplace.” “It would also take into account any changes taking place in the use and mode of public transport by different people due to the Covid situation so that we can come out with policies on a stable environment friendly public transport system,” said an official. Hidco and NKDA had earlier introduced three electric run buses and more will be procured. Electric vehicle charging points have been set up and the authorities are putting a lot of stress on developing e-bikes and cycling as pollution-free public transport modes and encouraging people to use battery operated vehicles. Already 100 app-based public bicycle sharing scheme with dedicated cycle lanes is operating and 100 e-bikes have also been introduced in the township.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/task-force-for-new-towns-green-transport/articleshow/84772798.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: New rules to curb fictitious bidding for mining leases||JAIPUR: Mining mafia that indulged in fictitious bidding to stall government’s e-auction process and continue illegal mining won’t be easy. As per recent amendments to the Rajasthan Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 2021, such bidders will be debarred from participating for the next five years. “If a successful bidder fails to comply with the provisions of sub-rule (7A), bid security deposited by him shall be forfeited and he shall be debarred for five years in participating further e-auction. In such case, fresh e-auction shall be conducted,” the amendment reads. Similarly, bid security money which the fictitious bidders forfeit has also been raised to curb such unlawful practices. “We have noticed in some cases that the fictitious bidders just don’t allow genuine investors or entrepreneurs to bid and get leases. And they continue to extract mineral from the blocks unlawfully depriving the government its revenues and creating law and order situation,” said Subodh Agarwal, additional chief secretary, mines and petroleum. Agarwal said the new rules will ensure debarment of those successful bidders who do not deposit the lease money and start operating the leases legally. In fact, the modus operandi has been witnessed in many cases including some 14 blocks in Alwar. The bidders put bids at exponential rates and the genuine bidders had no chance to match the rates. In the 14 blocks the bid price went up to Rs 75 crore. After they were declared winners, they did not show up for depositing the money and knowingly allowed to forfeit their money. The blocks remained unsanctioned and the illegal mining continued. The mining mafia adopted the same modus operandi for the e-auctions that were conducted later. Agarwal said with the new amended rules it would be now difficult for the mining mafia to deploy the same strategy and continue illegal mining on the government land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/new-rules-to-curb-fictitious-bidding-for-mining-leases/articleshow/84775328.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Over 200 women lend their voice to farmers’ agitation||NEW DELHI: With the farmers’ agitation entering the eighth month, more than 200 women gathered at Jantar Mantar on Monday and took turns to voice their demands and raise slogans demanding scrapping of the three farm laws. The women’s Kisan Sansad was moderated by “speaker” Subhasini Ali. It commenced with the singing of the national anthem, followed by observation of silence for two minutes in the memory of farmers who died during the agitation. The women said politicians called them names, but it didn’t deter them from keeping the protest alive. Actress-activist Gul Panag was also present there in their support. “Sikhs are known to help people, and that’s why the entire world is standing in our support. Yet, the government has paid no heed to us. We were here yesterday to demand our rights and we will be here tomorrow, too, if those are not fulfilled,” said Satinder Kaur, who has been staying at Singhu border since the last two months along with her family members. Manpreet, another protester, said it was shameful how the government was treating them and refusing to listen to them. “If the demands are unanswered, it means the government is failing to understand why we are protesting in the first place. What joy are we getting in sitting on the streets? None. Yet it seems like a joke to the government,” she added. Another participant, Kiran, said most women there had been away from their homes for long, along with their children. She added, “Men and women have equally taken part in the protest ever since it began. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that so many women have gathered here today to protest for their rights.” “Many politicians have villainised us and claimed that farmers have ulterior motives. But no one is ready to listen to what we want. We are fighting hard for our rights. We are barely a short distance away from Parliament, yet there has been no indication of any dialogue. Our sansad will continue,” said Sudesh, a farmer. Farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders since November 26 last year against the three farm laws, Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farms Services Act 2020 and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-200-women-lend-their-voice-to-farmers-agitation/articleshow/84772974.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

---||Kolkata||Case backlog soars in West Bengal's consumer court||KOLKATA: Continued uncertainty over the resumption of work at the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission — or consumer court — that has remained shut since May 15 has left several thousands of litigants and lawyers apprehensive. The closure of the apex consumer court in the state has also led to a ripple effect in district-level courts. A senior officer said the state was trying to resolve the logistics during the pandemic to get the court functioning. “The court authority said that the court cannot function without resolving those logistic issues in this pandemic situation,” said an officer of the department. TOI contacted Gadhadhar Chatterjee, the registrar of the court, who refused to comment. The commission, which functions under the state consumer affairs department, hardly operated last year due to the lockdown. This year, it started functioning, only to be closed due to the second wave of Covid-19. Thousands of litigants, mostly related with real estate projects, are at the receiving end of this stalemate. “After the Supreme Court declared West Bengal Housing Industrial Regulatory Authority (HIRA) Act unconstitutional, all the real-estate related cases came back to this commission, which can handle cases worth Rs 10 lakh to Rs 1 crore,” said Prabir Basu, a prominent consumer law expert. Across the nation, the Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act, 2016, is effective to handle real estate cases. HIRA is modelled on RERA. But Supreme Court has ruled that West Bengal’s separate real estate regulation is repugnant to the central government’s Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act, 2016, and is unconstitutional. Unless new RERA court is in place, real estate consumers have no other places than this consumer court to seek redress. In Bengal, like any other places, the highest number of consumers are grappling with issues like not handing over the apartment to the buyer despite making 90% payment, selling one apartment to multiple buyers, selling apartments completely of different dimensions than the promised ones. “Now, the majority of these complaints remain unresolved. Man’s basic right to shelter is compromised,” said H Brahmachari, president of the Consumer Court Bar Association. “I met the court officials and wrote to the president of the commission with an appeal to resume the functioning of the court without any delay. The closure seriously jeopardises the interest of thousands of consumers who are often denied their basic rights as consumers by the sellers of the products, be it real estate property or a service. Three court rooms at this state-level commission list nearly 200 cases a day, but only a third of them could be heard. Just imagine the backlog of cases,” said Brahmachari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/case-backlog-soars-in-consumer-court/articleshow/84772845.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Poor nutritional status increases Covid mortality rate, finds study||KOLKATA: The nutritional status of Covid-19 patients is linked with the outcome of treatment as well as mortality, according to a study conducted at a city hospital. The yet-to-be-peer-reviewed study found poorer the nutritional status, the worse was the clinical outcome. The study also showed more deaths among patients who had bad nutritional status. It has recommended evaluation of nutritional status of Covid-19 infected patients who need hospital care so that this aspect could also be taken into consideration during treatment. The observational study conducted at Peerless Hospital had surveyed 106 patients above 18 years for the study. The nutritional status of each patient was evaluated using MUST (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool), a widely used screening tool in the West. While the ideal MUST score is zero, 13 patients scored 1 on the MUST scale and 22 patients scored 2 and above. Seventy one patients, however, passed the MUST test. While 89 patients recovered and were discharged from the hospital, 17 of them died. Of the 17 deaths, 11 had scored 2 and above on MUST while one had a score of 1, two others had 0 score. “Our aim was to find if there is any correlation between the nutritional status of a patient to the treatment outcome. Our study could establish poor nutrition leads to bad clinical outcome. Covid management is multidisciplinary. If we screen patients and assess for nutritional risk well in advance and take care of this aspect in the management of the patient, this could lead to better treatment outcome,” said Peerless Hospital clinical research and academics director Subhrojyoti Bhowmick. Of the 22 patients who scored 2 and above on MUST, 17 were in the 50-plus age group. Of them, 14 had died. “This kind of screening is being done mostly in NABH-accredited hospitals. We strongly feel that more hospitals should conduct this screening so that in addition to medications and therapies like oxygen, doctors can take care of the nutritional status of the patient,” said hospital’s chief dietician Sudeshna Maitra Nag, who was also part of the study titled ‘Nutritional risk assessment using MUST in Covid-19 patients’. The study concluded that higher nutritional risk was observed in elder patients and higher MUST score was associated with higher mortality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/poor-nutritional-status-increases-covid-mortality-rate-finds-study/articleshow/84772875.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Mumbai||BEST’s electric footprint to rise to 15% with 100 double-deckers||MUMBAI: Expect 12% of BEST’s 3,300 buses to be electric by the year-end, when it will have 380 e-buses. To boost the e-move, the undertaking decided on Monday to procure 100 new e-double deckers, which could push the electric footprint to 15% (nearly 500 e-buses) by early 2022. BEST general manager Lokesh Chandra on Monday announced that the undertaking wants to scrap its plan of procuring diesel double-deckers and will go instead for ‘pure electric’ twin-deck buses. TimesViewWhile it is a good decision by BEST to increase electric vehicles, it also has to ensure wet-lease buses run on green fuel. As many as 550 such buses run on diesel, which is not what the city wants. BEST committee and administration should join hands for a cleaner Mumbai and sign contracts for buses which run only on CNG or are electric.The iconic double-deckers have been popular among Mumbaikars for decades, but its fleet shrunk lately from 120 a few years back to 48. Twenty-eight more could be phased out in the coming months as they complete their lifespan, sources said. BEST is in a hurry to get new twin-deck buses so that it maintains the double-decker fleet at 120. “We have approached manufacturers to incorporate latest technology and submit bids for the e-double-decker buses. If they can run in cities abroad, why not in Mumbai?” he said. Such buses are in operation in China, US and UK. Chandra said it will cost Rs 68-70 lakh to purchase a normal double-decker in Mumbai and an electric variant would increase cost by 150%, which is over Rs 1.7 crore per bus. Chandra said though capital costs for each bus will be high, long-running and maintenance costs will be low and commuters will get noiseless, zero emission buses which will be good for the city. Besides, having a double-decker means occupying less road space and carrying 90 passengers in a single trip. Another environment-friendly move by BEST will be to bring in more CNG or electric buses rather than diesel on wet-lease, where a private party supplies the bus, maintains it, provides a driver and fuel, while BEST deploys its conductor and has 100% rights over the earnings from operating it. An official said, “We have nearly 550 AC mini-buses on wet lease which run on diesel. When we sign contracts with operators, we will explore the possibility of smaller CNG or electric buses.” This week, BEST gets 25 new single-decker electric buses which are longer (12 metres) so they can accommodate more commuters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bests-electric-footprint-to-rise-to-15-with-100-double-deckers/articleshow/84775451.cms||Somit Sen

---||Goa||Angulo completes move to Mumbai City||Panaji: Mumbai City FC have kickstarted their foreign signing for this season with the capture of Igor Angulo. Angulo, 37, won the Golden Boot in the Indian Super League (ISL) last season with 14 goals for FC Goa. He helped the team qualify for the semi-finals and lost against eventual champions Mumbai on penalties. The Spanish striker was in talks with Odisha FC for almost a month and was on the verge of joining them. However, Mumbai managed to make him rethink and within days, the signing formalities were completed. “Angulo has joined Mumbai. It’s a done deal,” a source who has tracked the development told TOI on Tuesday. Angulo is understood to be the first new foreign signing for this season with three new players expected to join. Moroccan midfielder Ahmed Jahouh and Senegalese defender Mourtada Fall, both of whom followed coach Sergio Lobera to Mumbai, will continue for another season. Hugo Boumous had also moved from Goa to Mumbai last season after winning the ISL League Winners’ Shield. However, he has now switched allegiance to ATK Mohun Bagan in a record transfer. Mumbai won the League Winners’ Shield and ISL Trophy last season, but allowed both strikers – Adam Le Fondre and Bartholomew Ogbeche – to join other clubs. Angulo will take one of the two striking spots in the team, and with a proven record in front of goal, will provide Lobera with options. Before arriving in Goa, the former Gornik Zabrze forward was included in the Best XI of Ekstraklasa, the premier league in Poland, for three successive seasons. At 37, Angulo’s age may raise eyebrows, but the striker has been scoring consistently for the last five seasons. When Angulo arrived in Poland in 2016, his side were in the second division. Goals from the left-footed striker ensured Gornik were back among the elite. In 2017-18, he finished second in the goalscorers list behind Carlitos, another Spanish striker at Wisła Krakow, by just one goal. In 2018-19, Angulo did even better, this time finishing as the best player of the league and the Golden Boot winner with 24 goals, one more than the previous season.

---||Chandigarh||Farm debt weight: Rs 71,305 crore in Punjab, Rs 78,311 crore in Haryana||CHANDIGARH: In the run-up to the Punjab assembly polls when questions are being raised over the state government’s unfulfilled election promise of complete farm loan waiver to nearly 15 lakh farmers in the state, as per the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) over 21.49 lakh bank accounts of Punjab have outstanding agriculture loans amounting to Rs 71,305 crore. Union minister of state for finance Bhagwat Karad shared this information in the ongoing monsoon session of the parliament on Monday. However, Karad made it clear, “There is no proposal under consideration of the Union government to waive farm loans.” In neighbouring Haryana, there are 44.95 lakh bank accounts which had an outstanding agriculture loan of Rs 78,311 crore as on March 31 this year. Over 5.55 lakh farmers in Himachal Pradesh have to pay back agriculture loan amounting to Rs 9,605 crore and 78,642 people living in UT Chandigarh have an outstanding agriculture loan of Rs 2,449 crore. Ahead of the 2017 Punjab assembly election, the Congress had promised to waive loans of 15 lakh farmers if voted to power. After the Congress government took over in March 2017, it watered down the scheme and has till date waived loans of 5.64 lakh farmers, totalling Rs 4,624 crore. Later the Punjab government decided to offer the farm loan waiver to only small and marginal farmers who own up to two-hectare agriculture land, have an outstanding loan of up to Rs 2 lakh, are not income tax payees and are not employed in public sector jobs. The highest number of 54,444 farm loan waiver beneficiaries in Punjab are in Sangrur district , and they have been disbursed Rs 370.38 crore till date. As many as 46,534 farmers in Ludhiana have got a farm loan waiver of Rs 381 crore, followed by 43,078 in Patiala (Rs 365 crore) and 42,014 in Bathinda (Rs 275 crore).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-debt-weight-rs-71305cr-in-punjab-rs-78311cr-in-haryana/articleshow/84777135.cms||Sanjeev Verma
---||Mumbai||Bombay high court begins hearing quashing pleas of Elgar Parishad accused||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday began hearing quashing petitions filed by accused Rona Wilson and Shoma Sen in the 2018 Elgar Parishad case citing lack of evidence. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) counsel Sandesh Patil raised a preliminary objection saying the chargesheet, filed before trial court, be brought on record before the HC. Senior counsel Indira Jaising, arguing the activists’ case before a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar, said the NIA is relying only on letters and hard disks and what the agency has is not evidence in the eyes of law. Jaising claimed that someone else was responsible for the violence that broke out the day after the Elgar Parishad held on December 31, 2017, in Pune’s Shaniwarwada. She further said that the police had initially arrested one Milind Ekbote for the violence and released him. Jaising asked where was the material to even charge the activists with serious offences of attacking the sovereignty of the country. Terming it a case of “selective” prosecution, Jaising questioned the gathering of “evidence” and asked the issue also is whether Wilson’s computer has been tampered with. The hearing will continue on the next date. The two activists are relying on an US-based forensic lab report that indicated planting of evidence on Wilson's laptop. Sen’s petition also said that her incarceration is on the “basis of fraudulent evidence in order to falsely implicate critical dissenting intellectuals…by slapping cases under stringent laws against public justice”. The NIA’s reply had “stoutly” denied the “report of Arsenal Consultancy and also the report of the American Bar Association”. The independent forensic report of a “malware” attack on Wilson’s computer “cannot be looked into at this stage”, said the NIA, adding that it came into the picture in January 2020 when the probe was transferred to it from Pune police. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bombay-high-court-begins-hearing-quashing-pleas-of-elgar-accused/articleshow/84777122.cms||---

As talks of Yediyurappa’s exit intensified, the 16 ‘outsiders’, who crossed the aisle to join BJP in 2019, were in a state of flux over their own future prospects. Sources in the BJP suggest that the new CM who will be hand-picked by the central leadership, no matter who it is, will in all probability try to axe the 11 ‘outsider ministers’ in the cabinet to accommodate more youngsters and party loyalists, who have held a grudge for not getting their due.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/turncoat-ministers-get-edgy-after-bsy-exit/articleshow/84778103.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Hospitals in Kolkata get third-wave ready with paediatric dialysis training||KOLKATA: As a part of the preparation to combat the potential third wave, the state health department will start training medical technologists in handling dialysis of paediatric patients. With a section of healthcare experts fearing a large number of children getting infected in the third wave, doctors said some will require dialysis support during treatment. “Dialysis for children is different from the procedure on adults for various reasons, including difficulty in accessing the central venous line, size of tubing and dialysers. Any variation could affect their metabolism and hence they need more intense monitoring during the process,” said Medical College Hospital-Kolkata assistant professor of paediatrics Dibyendu Raychaudhuri. Doctors, however, said that even if the number of infected children might be large during the third wave, only a few could require renal dialysis support. In Bengal, paediatric dialysis in the government sector is currently available on at three hospitals — MCH, SSKM and NRS Medical College. “A child with no comorbidity is unlikely to need dialysis even in case of severe infection. Only children who already have kidney issues and a section of those affected with most common Covid symptoms or MIS-C might require dialysis as acute kidney failure is one of the spectrum of MIS-C,” said MCH associate paediatric professor Mihir Sakar, who is also the PICU in-charge. The six-day training will be conducted from MCH, NRS Medical College and SSKM Hospital from August 2. Technologists from districts will also be trained. “Though we don’t expect too many children requiring dialysis support, we need to keep our infrastructure and manpower ready,” said a state health department official. Earlier, the state had asked all hospitals to keep paediatric Covid beds ready. Accordingly, almost all city hospitals as well as district hospitals have revamped their facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hospitals-get-third-wave-ready-with-paediatric-dialysis-training/articleshow/84772966.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The committee said that it has received a complaint stating that engineering colleges were forcing students to pay tuition fee in a single instalment despite directions from the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to allow multiple instalments in view of the financial difficulties faced by many due to the Covid crisis. “All the engineering colleges are directed to follow the instructions of AICTE with regard to payment of tuition fee by students and not to coerce them to pay the fee in a single instalment. Appropriate action would be taken against colleges that do not follow the existing rules/instruction issued by all concerned,” read a release from TAFRC addressed to the principals of engineering colleges. The representation given by Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) said that a student named Lavanya, second year B Tech of Princeton Institute of Engineering and Technology for Women, had killed herself for want of money to pay the tuition fee.

AAP Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha made the announcement on Monday in the presence of party’s state president Bhagwant Mann. The AAP national spokesperson was interacting with mediapersons at Chandigarh Press Club after the Congress leader Gurmeet Singh Khudian joined the AAP. “Today, we make it clear, once and for all, that AAP will fight the 2022 elections on its own. We will not form an alliance with any party. We will field candidates in all the 117 assembly constituencies,” said Chadha. However, he welcomed all leaders from other political parties in AAP who want prosperity of Punjab. Mann said people of the state were grieved from the mafia rule of the Badals, and now they were more infuriated from the Congress mafia government. “That is why the people see the Aam Aadmi Party as a hope and have made up their minds to hand over the responsibility of government,” he added. Ex-Cong leader from Muktsar joins AAPIn Bathinda, late MP Jagdev Singh Khudian’s son and former Muktsar district Congress committee president Gurmeet Singh Khudian on Monday joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) along with associates. AAP Punjab president Bhagwant Mann, Punjab affairs co-in-charge Raghav Chadha and MLAs Meet Hayer and Baljinder Kaur welcomed Khudian to the party. Khudian has been an active Congress leader in Lambi assembly constituency and district president, Mukstar. Only two days back, he had resigned from Congress. Khudian said he was impressed by the pro-people policies of the AAP and the work done by Arvind Kejriwal government in Delhi. Congress government had ignored Malwa and Congress workers. Khudian said the Congress leaders were colluding with SAD to deceive the people of Punjab, that is why he and his associates left the Congress and joined the AAP. He said he would diligently perform every service rendered by the AAP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-to-go-solo-in-2022-state-co-incharge/articleshow/84777192.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Airport customs inspector steals Rs 34 lakh of gold belonging to US national||MUMBAI: A customs inspector at the airport was arrested last week for stealing 995gms of gold coins worth Rs 34 lakh from the customs warehouse before getting transferred to another place in April. He has been booked under IPC for criminal breach of trust by a public servant. The gold coins were brought to India by US national Jeffrey Holmes Harrissin during his visit on January 13, 2020. However, he was not allowed to carry them along as he hadn’t paid customs duty. The coins were kept in the detention room since there is a provision whereby flyers can keep detained articles in the warehouse and collect them while flying back to their own country. Accused Uday Singh Gurjar, posted at Mumbai’s airport, allegedly planned to steal the gold after he noticed that the US national had not come back for over a year to collect the valuables kept inside the safe of the customs warehouse. A departmental inquiry has been initiated against Gurjar and he has been suspended from work. There were two other US nationals who had come to Mumbai along with Harrissin and they too had left their gold coins at the customs warehouse. All three were given a detention receipt which has to be produced before the customs official for collecting the items before leaving the country. “While the two other US nationals collected their gold from the warehouse after returning the receipt, Gurjar had marked an arrow in the register to show that Harrissin too had collected his 995gms of gold,” said a Sahar police officer. “The gold was in the safe till March but went missing in April. The theft came to light after Harrissin filed an FIR with the police on not being allowed to collect his gold on July 3, and an inquiry was carried out by the Airport Customs,” the officer said. Initially, the customs claimed Harrissin had collected the gold. But when Harrissin showed them the detention receipt, the customs authority went through electronic records and found out that Gurjar had committed the offence. Police said Gurjar was called for inquiry, and after confirming his role, the customs department suspended him. “The customs recovered the gold from Gurjar and handed it over to Harrissin after taking a written note acknowledging that he had received his valuables,”police said. Gurjar has been sent to judicial custody after his three-day police custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-airport-customs-inspector-steals-rs-34l-of-gold-belonging-to-us-natl/articleshow/84777228.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath unveils portal for interaction with government||LUCKNOW: To ensure greater participation of people in governance, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath launched ‘MyGov-Meri Sarkar’ portal on Monday. The portal will give citizens a platform to post comments and suggestions and directly communicate with the government on various policies and schemes. The website is an extension of the MyGov portal launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 26, 2014. “It is an attempt to ensure people’s participation in governance and get their feedback to give a final shape to policies. More than 10 crore people are directly linked with the portal which is a testimony to its popularity,” the CM said. “Governments announce schemes but there is no participation of people in drafting these schemes. In a democracy, the government is of the people, for the people and by the people. This portal will help us ensure that the public is as much a part of good governance as the government is,” Yogi said, adding that not only would the people get benefits of various schemes through the portal, the government would also get their inputs and suggestions to ensure that every section of the society receives benefits. Emphasising on the importance of technology in governance, the CM gave the example of the public distribution system in the state. “The use of POS (point of sale) machines in fair price shops resulted in a massive reduction in corruption. There were several issues with the food distribution system but we successfully addressed food security through technology,” Yogi said. “The problem persisted till 2016. In 2017, I visited places where deaths due to hunger had taken place. These people had ration cards but no information on how to use them. Their ration was being siphoned off. Then we installed POS machines in more than 80,000 fair process shops, leading to a crackdown on corruption and savings for the government,” he said. Addressed the meeting virtually, Union minister for electronics and information technology, Ashwani Vaishnav, said technology was being used to achieve the dream of ‘antyodaya’. “The PM is encouraging the use of technology in various fields like digital payments and direct bank transfers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-unveils-portal-for-interaction-with-govt/articleshow/84775505.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Delhi||Delhi: This gang sent fake notices for watching porn to dupe many||NEW DELHI: Three men have been arrested for running an online extortion racket routed through Cambodia. They used adware and browser pop-ups to display fake police notices directing the targets to pay a fine of Rs 3,000 for watching pornography online. The accused have been identified as Gabrial James and Ram Kumar from Chennai and B Dhinushanth from Trichy, who was the mastermind. While monitoring grievance on social media, police found a few people reporting about a notice wherein they were told by the “cops” that since they were watching pornography online, all files in their computer had been blocked. They would have to pay a fine of Rs 3,000 for indulging in such “illegal” activities. DCP (Cyber Cell) Anyesh Roy said the victims reported that these messages came even though they were only doing routine searches on their web browser and not watching any pornographic content.  “Since this was a case of cheating in the name of law enforcement agencies, an FIR was lodged suo motu based on the social media inputs. Technical analysis of the pop-up notices showed that they were being routed through foreign locations. However, the money trail led to multiple accounts being operating from Tamil Nadu. Our teams camped at Chennai, Trichy, Coimbatore, Udhagamandalam and several other places. They finally zeroed in on the three suspects and arrested them,” added Roy. During interrogation, Dhinushanth revealed that the technical part of the operation — hosting of bogus police notice and its targeted display to internet users — was being handled by his brother, B Chanderkant, from Veal Pon near Phnom Penh in Cambodia. “So far, we have found more than 20 bank accounts that were used to route the defrauded money. Cheating of over Rs 30 lakh was done through UPI IDs and QR codes from February to June. Dhinushanth said the money was moved out of the banking system through cryptocurrencies by his brother,” said the DCP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/this-gang-sent-fake-notices-for-watching-porn-to-dupe-many/articleshow/84773058.cms||---

Patil has named the four men in his police complaint. Anil Badgujar, the PI of the Ramanand police station, said two rounds were fired at Patil near his residence at Mayur Nagar at 9 pm. However, the deputy mayor escaped unscathed. SP Privin Munde said, “Police teams have been sent to different places to track down the culprits.” Munde added that as per the complainant, at 4 pm, two groups had a petty dispute during a cricket match. Kulbhushan Patil had attempted to intervene and resolve the matter. As the matter could not be resolved, both the groups went to the police station and cross-complaints of a non-cognizable offense were registered. Later in the night, four men (two of them brothers) from one of the groups came to the Mayur Nagar area in a car and started abusing Patil. An argument ensued and one of the four men fired a shot at the deputy mayor. Patil and his associate fled towards his home — about 100m away — on a bike. The four persons allegedly chased him and fired another shot near his bungalow. Patil had won the Jalgaon municipal election on a BJP ticket.

In fact, the road is 27 feet wide, including kutcha portion. Approximately 900 grown up trees are standing on either side of the road on the extreme corners of the road, after gap of 4.5 feet each, beyond proposed 18 feet width of this link road.  It was alleged by the petitioner that the PWD (B&R), through its contractor, is planning to axe these 900 trees, although these trees do not stand in the way of vehicular traffic, even if the road is widened to 18 feet from existing 10 feet width. Taking the matter seriously, the HC bench directed the respondents that demand notice submitted by petitioner on July 19 against cutting of trees be first decided. It was made clear by the HC that no trees shall be cut till the decision of demand notice, in any case, if some trees may be coming within the proposed widened road of 18 feet width, it may be considered to modify the road widening plan, so as to save the trees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-halts-felling-of-trees-for-road-widening/articleshow/84777240.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal trains 32 cops in crime scene management||KOLKATA: Thirty-two police officers — inspectors and sub-inspectors from nine police divisions — have started receiving special training from this week to carry out basic forensic evidence collection at a crime spot. These officers, to be posted with the divisions, will be the first responders to any crime. Their job would be to ensure that they preserve basic forensic evidence and secure the area before forensic teams from labs reach the spot. Photography of the scene of crime will be one prime job for these officers. This is the first batch that is undergoing training. Lalbazar is planning to train at least two officers in each police station about forensic evidence collection. “There is a set process in requisitioning a forensic team to the incident spot, and the resultant delay can be as long as 24 hours. Without immediate collection of evidence, the probe team runs the risk of losing vital clues. The divisional forensic teams can reach quickly to the spot and cut down the chance of the clues being lost forever. These men will also be trained in using a basic forensic kit,” claimed a police source. According to sources, the Kolkata wing of forensic science is in charge of conducting examinations of Kolkata Police, Howrah City Police and Bidhannagar City Police cases. But due to limited number of experts, attending incident spots promptly is not always possible for them. Thus, several pieces of evidence are either getting tampered with or getting erased naturally. According to experts, investigation involves collection and examination of evidence at crime scenes. “Evidence that are key to a probe include fingerprints, hair, fibre or DNA, which are then taken to a crime laboratory for analysis. There is now crucial technical analysis too and picking up gadgets for that purpose is important. The crime scene investigator training will teach these officers about the various types of evidence they might encounter in the field. Cops will learn about the types of evidence they are going to look for, and then about all aspects of detection, collection, identification, transportation, and how to keep the chain of custody until they hand over evidence to the laboratory for analysis,” said a police source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-trains-32-cops-in-crime-scene-management/articleshow/84773039.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

A bomb disposal (BD) team along with Peddemul police visited the building and seized 1,100 gelatin sticks and 3,000 detonators kept in wooden crates from the building. “Nearly half of Peddemul would have been wiped out if an explosion occurred at the building. It was sheer luck that nothing happened at such a carelessly maintained storage,” a BD squad member said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/explosives-stored-in-irrigation-dept-facility/articleshow/84775535.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Panchayati raj department to hire 58,189 assistants, data operators||LUCKNOW: Days after the Cabinet cleared the proposal for hiring of 58,189 gram panchayat assistants and data entry operators, the panchayati raj department said the recruitment process would begin by the end of July and conclude by September 10. Ever since the Yogi Adityanath government came to power in 2017, this will be the single largest contractual recruitment that the government will be carrying out, just a few months before the state goes into assembly polls. Since 2017, the government has provided jobs on contractual basis to 47,546 people. Panchayati Raj minister Bhupendra Singh Chaudhary said for the 58,189 gram panchayats in the state, only 16,421 posts of gram panchayat and gram development officers had been sanctioned, against which only 11,008 people were employed. “The underconstruction and existing panchayat bhawans under renovation will be developed as mini secretariats and have space for banking correspondent sakhis and common service centres for villagers,” he said. “Shortage of manpower has seriously hampered the work of gram panchayats since officers have 4-5 panchayats each under them. To make gram panchayats more effective, the cabinet cleared the proposal for hiring of assistants and data operators for panchayats,” he said. The panchayati raj department has issued a detailed protocol for hiring of panchayat assistants, which includes ensuring that no close relative of a gram pradhan is given the post. According to the order, information regarding the recruitment will be issued by the respective pradhan. Applications will be accepted for 15 days after the issue of notice and all will be vetted by the panchayat committee. Candidates applying for the posts should be in the age group of 18-40 years. Those belonging to SC/ST and OBC categories will be given relaxation of five years. The candidates will have to be a resident of the same gram panchayat for which the application is made. The minimum educational qualification is intermediate but average marks of intermediate and high school will be considered. “Candidates who have lost a family member due to Covid will be given preference. There will also be reservation for candidates. If a seat was reserved for a woman or SC or OBC candidate during panchayat election, candidate of the same category will be hired in the particular panchayat,” Chaudhary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/panchayati-raj-dept-to-hire-58189-assts-data-operators/articleshow/84775539.cms||---

Total 3,000 vaccines were procured by the two wings of the RKM through its hospital at Narendrapur. The camps at Belur Math started on Sunday and will go on till August 1. The camps at Narendrapur have already inoculated 837 people. Total Rs 19 lakh — that was required to buy the vaccines — was donated to RKM by a devotee. At Belur, 350 people were vaccinated on Sunday. Workers at petrol pumps, tailoring shops, grocery units, construction sites and vegetable and fruit vendors were brought to the Belur Math campus of RKMVERI for vaccination. “We have decided to start intense work in this area because poor people need support since they cannot afford to pay for vaccination at the private facilities. We will visit the districts and tribal areas across Bengal to vaccinate poor people,” said Swami Atmapriyananda, pro-chancellor and secretary of RKMVERI. The institute has received a special mobile van, Swasthya Dhenu. The Rs 18 lakh ambulance was donated by a devotee, H Sudarshan, who runs a charitable trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rkm-procures-3000-doses-for-free-jabs-at-belur-math-narendrapur/articleshow/84773068.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The youth, Devensh Agarwal (26), a resident of Harish Mukherjee Road, reportedly went too close to the wild herd. Preliminary investigation revealed that the youth and his two friends had been to Jhargram where the trio checked in a hotel. In the afternoon, they came to know that a herd of eight or nine elephants were roaming in the Keudisol forest. However, it is not clear to the police how the three had gone too close to the herd. One of the elephants lifted him with its trunk and flung him against a tree. His friends, who managed to escape, sought help from locals. The SP in Jhargram, Biswajit Ghosh, said: “We have started a probe and are checking whether the victim was trying to click a selfie with the elephant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/youth-gets-too-close-to-jumbo-killed/articleshow/84773094.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Delhi||Delhi HC seeks stand of govts, civic bodies on separate toilets for transgenders||NEW DELHI: Concerned over the rights of transgenders, Delhi High Court on Monday sought the stand of authorities on a PIL seeking separate washrooms for the third gender on the ground that absence of separate public toilets for transgenders make them prone to sexual assault and harassment. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notices and sought responses of the ministry of housing and urban affairs, Delhi government, New Delhi Municipal Council and the three municipal corporations on the plea that argued that absence of gender-neutral toilets goes against the directions of the Supreme Court. TimesViewTransgenders are often subject to various forms of social discrimination and abuse. Separate washrooms would give them a safe space. The request should be positively considered.The petition said the central government has released funds but no separate toilets have been made for the transgender or third gender community in Delhi, while cities such as Mysore, Bhopal and Ludhiana have already built separate public washrooms for them. “There are no separate toilet facilities for transgenders, they have to use male toilets where they are prone to sexual assault and harassment. Discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation or gender identity, therefore, impairs equality before law and equal protection of law and violates Article 14 of the Constitution,” the plea contended. It submitted that the plight of transgenders is compounded by the fact they do not even have any remedy available for the same as there are no provisions in the IPC that protects transgenders from sexual assault by any male, female or another transgender. People, including men, women and transgenders, feel uncomfortable and hesitate when the third gender uses the washrooms which are made for others, the plea said, adding that this also violates the ‘right to privacy’ of the third gender. It said every human being, of any gender, has some basic human rights including facilities for using separate toilets and it is not fundamentally or morally correct to ask any specific gender to use a public toilet, which is made for another gender. The PIL said the transgender community consists of 7-8% of the total population of the country, which makes it necessary for the authorities to provide same facilities and equal treatment to them in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-stand-of-govts-civic-bodies-on-separate-toilets-for-transgenders/articleshow/84773149.cms||---
---||Lucknow||RLD’s social engineering through ‘bhaichara’ rallies||Lucknow: After an aggressive Brahmin outreach by SP and BSP, it’s now the turn of the Jayant Chaudhary-led Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) to organise ‘bhaichara’ (brotherhood) programmes in communally sensitive west UP region from Tuesday. It’s being seen as a desperate move by the Jat-dominated political outfit to seek a resurrection ahead of the high-stake UP assembly elections due next year. The proposed two-month long programme will be rolled out from Khatauli in Muzaffarnagar district which was hit by communal conflagration in 2013. Confirming the development, Chaudhary told TOI that the objective of the programme is to amalgamate forward and backward caste groups, besides upholding the Hindu-Muslim unity which is indispensably needed at this point of time. The development comes a day after SP chief Akhilesh Yadav met Jayant at the latter’s house in Delhi, stoking speculations of the two leaders firming up for alliance to take on the mighty BJP in the 2022 state elections. Terming it as a “Bhaichara Zindabad Programme”, Chaudhary maintained that the idea was to blur the caste and religious lines for perusal of “issue-based” politics which is critically desired in the present times. “We would be organising conventions to bring together different communities,” he said. Experts interpreted it as a RLD’s frantic attempt to lay ground for political messaging that could potentially counter BJP’s deft electoral strategy, essentially in the west UP region comprising around 125 assembly seats. “The role of civil society happens to be very important in quelling social tensions whenever they arise. They need to nip in the bud before any undesirable manifestations,” Chaudhary said. He added that one cannot rule out the malicious designs of anti-social elements to trigger tensions between various caste and religious groups in the run up to the assembly elections. “People, therefore, need to be made aware and more cautious,” he said. As a matter of fact, Jayant’s father and former RLD chief late Ajit Singh, too, had started ‘Bhaichara’ programmes just before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. His efforts, however, did not bore much results. While Ajit lost from Muzafarnagar, Jayant faced a defeat in Baghpat. This was after RLD’s comprehensive decimation at the hands of BJP in 2014 Lok Sabha elections with Ajit and Jayant losing from their stronghold seats of Baghpat and Mathura, respectively. The electoral fortunes of RLD have been on a continuous downslide after 2002 when it contested on 38 seats and managed to win 14 securing 26.82% vote share on the seats it contested. The emergence of Mayawati-led BSP as a tenacious political force in 2007 assembly elections decisively dented RLD which could register a win on only 10 out of 254 seats it contested while securing 3.70% vote share. The resurgence of Samajwadi Party in 2012 further hit RLD which had then allied with the Congress. It contested 46 seats and won only nine bagging a vote share of 2.33%. RLD eventually got completely routed in 2017 assembly elections as a saffron wave swept through the state. The party could win just one out of 277 seats it contested. Its lone MLA, Sahender Singh Ramala from Chhaprauli assembly seat in Baghpat, too, switched over to BJP in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rlds-social-engineering-through-bhaichara-rallies/articleshow/84775571.cms||Pankaj Shah

Justice Anoop Chitkara also said that temporary bail or suspension of sentence, extending to a year after delivery, must be allowed even when the offences are very grave and accusations very severe. The HC made it plain that even those who stand convicted and their appeals closed deserve similar relief in whatever camouflage it may come. “What difference will it make to the state and society by postponing incarceration? The heavens will not fall if incarceration is postponed. There should be no restraints throughout pregnancy, no restraints during labour and delivery, and no restraints at least for a year after giving birth. Every expecting female deserves dignity during motherhood,” Justice Chitkara said. The court said that taking birth in jail might cause such trauma to the child that social hatred might follow, potentially creating an everlasting impact on the mind whenever questioned about birth. It is high time to take a contrarian call to the maxim "partus sequitur ventrem (that which is born follows the womb)", the court said, adding that good and nutritious food in prisons may give good physical health but cannot substitute good mental health. A pregnant woman, apprehending arrest on allegations of conspiring with her husband in the substance trade, from whose house the police had recovered 259 grams of diacetylmorphine (heroin) and 713 grams of tablets containing tramadol (quantities falling in the commercial category), had approached the high court for anticipatory bail. Earlier, the petitioner had filed a bail petition before the Kangra district special judge, but it was dismissed on January 19 this year. The court said that the mandate of Section 37 of the NDPS Act implies that the accused should satisfy two conditions to come out clean. The evidence collected by the investigator is legally insufficient to deny bail to the other accused in the absence of any other incriminating evidence or allegations and is further mellowed by the criminal history of her husband. Thus, the petitioner has satisfied the first condition. It said that to meet the second condition, stringent conditions would be needed. Thus, on this ground alone, instead of limited period bail, she has satisfied the rigours of Section 37 of the NDPS Act. "Thus, the petitioner makes a case for release on bail during the trial in the facts and circumstances peculiar to this case," it said. "Given the above reasoning, the court is granting bail to the petitioner, subject to strict terms and conditions, which shall be over and above and irrespective of the contents of the form of bail bonds in Chapter XXXIII of CrPC, 1973," the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/pregnant-women-need-bail-not-jail-says-himachal-hc/articleshow/84778519.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Sanyukt Kisan Morcha now threatens to turn Lucknow into protest site||LUCKNOW: After leading farmers’ protest against the new farm laws on Delhi borders, the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Monday announced it would hold demonstrations in UP and Uttarakhand where the state assembly elections are due next year. Addressing reporters in Lucknow, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said that the morcha would hold public meetings in all districts of UP in the run up to a `mahapanchayat’ which is scheduled to be convened in Muzaffarnagar on September 5. The BKU happens to be part of the SKM. The morcha functionaries categorically threatened to turn Lucknow into a protest site just like it did in case of Delhi. The farmers’ front raising the ante coincided with the completion of eight months of farmers’ protest against the three farm laws. Tikait accused the ruling BJP in UP of not purchasing wheat in promised quantity. He said that as against a production of 308 lakh tonnes, the UP government purchased only 56 lakh tonnes which was only 18% of the total. The state government, as a matter of fact, has been maintaining the wheat purchase made in 2021 was twice of what was done a year ago. “UP has often seen big agitations,” Tikait said, claiming that the ruling BJP in the state has been lending a cold shoulder to the plight of farmers. He said that while Rs 12,000 crore is due towards cane farmers, those in potato cultivation have been left financially dented. Yogendra Yadav of SKM said that the agitation of farmers has projected their political strength. He said that the Centre did not give the guarantee of minimum support price (MSP) which is a cause of concern for the poor farmer. The hard stance of SKM vis-à-vis UP and Uttarakhand is seen as a key indication of farmers’ body attempt of setting in motion its ‘mission UP’ to trouble the BJP which seeks to return to office after 2022 assembly elections. Tikait had on Sunday attacked the Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar for saying that the farm laws would not be repealed. Subsequently, a group of farmers from Meerut and Bijnor had reached UP gate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kisan-morcha-now-threatens-to-turn-lucknow-into-protest-site/articleshow/84775617.cms||Pankaj Shah

TOI had highlighted the precarious condition of the steps last year, but Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) — the development vehicle of the state tourism department — claimed that maintaining them was the job of the water resources department (WRD). The latter, in turn, said that it had not been informed about the deteriorating condition of the steps either by the local panchayat or any other government agency. WRD’s executive engineer Ankush Gaonkar, while agreeing that such projects come under his purview, said he was not even aware that the steps to Sernabatim beach were built by his department and that they had collapsed. GTDC assistant engineer Vishad Pole, on the other hand, said they had been built and maintained by the WRD. The steps at Sernabatim beach are just one of the several crumbling tourism infrastructure projects on beaches. Gazebos that dot the coast in South Goa have also been giving way and a number of fancy lamp posts have collapsed. Even toilet blocks, like the one lying at Fatrade since May 2019, reel under neglect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sernabatim-beach-steps-reduced-to-rubble/articleshow/84773159.cms||---

While there are no clear answers for why the doctor got Covid thrice, doctors told TOI that the reasons could range from SARS2 variants to her immunity levels to an incorrect diagnostic report (though RT-PCR is the gold standard for Covid-19 testing, it has a sensitivity of around 70%-75%). Reinfections among doctors have been reported across the world, with a couple of studies from within Mumbai hospitals as well. However, reinfections cannot be proved until swab samples from the two (or more) infections are compared using genetically sequencing. Read AlsoCovid-19: ‘Delta variant may breach vaccination shield’The Delta variant of the Covid-19 coronavirus has been found to be a major factor for breakthrough infections — Covid infection in persons who have received one or both doses of the vaccine — among healthcare workers at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in south Delhi.On Monday, a BMC official said Halari's latest samples were collected to check why she got infected despite vaccination. Studies—one by BMC and another by a private hospital—are underway to look at reasons for breakthrough infections in collaboration with the Foundation for Medical Research (FMR). Dr Halari, who tested positive the first time on June 17, 2020, while working in BMC's Covid centre in Mulund, was RT-PCR positive on two more occasions—May 29 and July 11. “I got mild symptoms all three times,” she said. The first time she got tested for Covid-19 last year because a colleague tested positive. “I finished my posting and decided to take a break for post-graduate entrance exams and have been homebound most of the time,” she said. In July, her entire family including her parents and 21-year-old brother, tested positive. Regarding Dr Halari's three positive reports, her treating doctor, Mehul Thakkar said, “It could a case of an incorrect RT-PCR report or that the second infection in May got reactivated in July.” Dr Thakkar had highlighted her case to BMC health officials, which led to swab samples being collected for the FMR-BMC study. FMR director Dr Nerges Mistry said reinfections could occur due to several reasons, including a person’s immunity levels or autoimmune conditions. “One other reason could be emergence of a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus,’’ she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/city-doc-tests-positive-thrice-despite-vax/articleshow/84777265.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Delhi||Delhi: North corporation plans group housing project near Town Hall||NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation will soon finalise the redevelopment scheme for the Walled City special areas. As a model project, a group housing residential redevelopment project on 3,000 sqm has been proposed behind Town Hall near Dangal Maidan. Officials say that MPD 2021 had provisions for redevelopment of the Walled City and the current proposal was pushed by lieutenant governor after the Anaj Mandi fire. “The draft for redevelopment scheme has been prepared with the help of a consultant after extensive discussions with elected representatives, residents and other stakeholders. The final project proposal will be placed before the standing committee for clearance on Tuesday,” a north corporation official said. “MPD 2021 had the provision of a special area redevelopment plan in which the corporation was supposed to start allowing amalgamation of plots to minimum of 3,000 sqm for their redevelopment as a complex to reduce congestion and fire hazard, but the plan could never materialise. It was taken up after the Anaj Mandi fire tragedy. In a recent meeting, the LG asked us to set up a pilot for this project,” the official stated. The corporation plans to carry out e-auction of land on a 99-year lease basis and the minimum reserve price has been fixed at Rs 22 crore. The time for erection of the new complex has been fixed at 3 years. “The site is in the heart of central Delhi and connected to SP Mukherjee Marg. The total area of the municipal corporation’s property is around 1,100sqm, which includes the DUSIB office, dhalao and urinal block. The adjoining property of a power discom has an area of 1,776 sqm. To meet the requirement of minimum 3000sqm area, the nearby road and Sushila Mohan Park may also be incorporated into the plan,” the official explained, adding that “the greenery of Sushila Mohan Park will be maintained.” The civic body plans to incentivise the participation of the power discom by offering higher FAR on the plot. The proposed site area is 3,478 sqm, while the redeveloped property will have a covered floor area of 6,548 sqm, the official said. The proposed new structure has a multi-storey building with commercial units on ground floor, community facilities on first floor and basement parking, a report prepared by the town planning department states. “The parking facility will be able to accommodate 73 vehicles for commercial and residential units, which will reduce congestion in the area. The redevelopment will create more office space while reducing fire hazard,” the official added. The town planning department has also prepared a proposal for a model commercial complex at Peeli Kothi. However, that will be put forth for discussion in the standing committee meeting later. “In the commercial complex, Delhi Jal Board will also be a stakeholder,” stated another north corporation official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-corporation-plans-group-housing-project-near-town-hall/articleshow/84773276.cms||Paras Singh

Dubbing the Congress regime as the “most corrupt and undemocratic”, Sharma said the entire government staff was up in arms and agitating due to the apathy of the state government. “Be it the ministerial staff, paramedical staff, anganwadi workers or safai karamcharis, government employees have never faced such hard times,” he said. He added it was unfortunate that till a few days ago, Sidhu was bringing vital issues of electricity, corruption in sand mine allotments , liquor mafia and non-existence of civil hospitals to fore, but the Congress high command by appointing him the state Congress president had silenced him. The state BJP president claimed that the BJP would form the next government in 2022 as the people of the state were done with the pathetic politics of the Congress. Amarinder made false promises in the last elections and did not live up to his word, he added. “We will come out with a roadmap for Punjab to put it back as a shining state of this country,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-punjab-chief-says-sidhu-silenced-with-elevation/articleshow/84777320.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Saffron outfit’s bid to unite Brahmins, Bhumihars, Tyagis in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: Even as political parties like the SP and BSP are trying to woo the Brahmins, who constitute 11% of UP’s population, a saffron family's fringe outfit -- Rashtriya Jagruk Brahman Mahasangh – has initiated efforts to unite Brahmins, Bhumihars and Tyagis. The group has reportedly chosen UP BJP vice-president AK Sharma, a former bureaucrat and a close confidante of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to lead the show. Till now, Sharma -- a Bhumihar -- had been focussing on eastern UP districts but, according to sources, he was in Ghaziabad for the past two days and attended the programme of the Mahasangh as the chief guest. BJP functionaries from these three castes also attended the event. The Mahasangh is headed by RD Sharma, who switched loyalty to the BJP after remaining in the BSP for 16 years. All attempts to contact BJP vice-president AK Sharma failed. “I am a BJP booth president (booth number 325) in Muradnagar assembly constituency. The programme was planned only five days ago,” RD Sharma said, claiming that his organisation had members in 17 states. When asked why only BJP leaders were invited, he said there was little choice as most of the people’s representatives were from the BJP. Those present in Mahakumbh were Ghaziabad Mayor Asha Sharma and BJP MLA from Sahibabad constituency in Ghaziabad, Sunil Sharma. RD Sharma had earlier hit out at BSP president Mayawati after her announcement to organise a Prabuddh Varg Sammelan to win over Brahmins. “If she is really concerned about the plight of Brahmins, she should have given prominent posts to Brahmin leaders at district levels,” he said. He also trashed Mayawati’s statement that Brahmins had been misguided. The development comes at the time when the BSP is in its fourth day of Prabuddh Varg Sammelan, led by Satish Chandra Mishra, the lone Brahmin face and national general secretary of the party. Mishra, who was recently appointed the national media coordinator of the BSP, had said on the first day of the Sammelan on July 23 that Brahmins were feeling cheated by the BJP and SP governments. Samajwadi Party, on the other hand, has also made an elaborate plan to woo Brahmins. Meanwhile, in a tweet, RD Sharma said: “Took blessings from gurujan who came from various districts to attend the Brahmin-Tyagi-Bhumihar Mahakumbh in Ghaziabad. I know the power of their blessings. My prayers that I continue to get their blessings…” “The idea behind the organisation’s bid to unite the three castes is that only they offer prayers to Bhagwan Parshuram,” Sharma said. Sources privy to the programme said if the three castes came together, they may add up to 17% of the voters and in some districts have a strong presence of around 27%, and no party would be able to ignore their combined might.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/saffron-outfits-bid-to-unite-brahmins-bhumihars-tyagis/articleshow/84775644.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Delhi||Delhi: Review of circle rate put into motion after 10 years||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has begun the exercise to review circle rates of residential, commercial, industrial and other types of lands in the city, the last assessment of this type having been done in 2011. The administration of the 11 districts have been asked to submit details of land within their boundaries with suggestions on the matter from the stakeholders. Accordingly, the districts have invited the view of residents’ welfare associations, architects, landowners, registered builders and other groups to ascertain a fair revaluation of land rates. The suggestions and recommendations of the stakeholders will be sent to an existing government committee consisting of representative officials from Delhi Development Authority, the municipal corporations and other administrative agencies, which will then make the final recommendation to the state government. Circle rates are the minimum rates of land and properties below which a property cannot be registered. The circle rates are also the slabs according to which stamp duty and registration charges are levied by the state. The committee will go through the suggestions to determine the crux of the opinions and this will form the basis of the panel’s report on the recommendations to Delhi government. The government will review the recommendations and take the final decision. The decision of the government will be final and the circle rates of the properties will change accordingly. A revenue department official of East district said that the revaluation of circle rates in respect of residential, industrial and other types of land and properties, barring agricultural and riverbed land, is under way. “We are seeking views and feedback from the stakeholders so that a comprehensive feedback from the district can be submitted,” the official said. The complete exercise, including the submission of the committee’s recommendations to the government, is likely to be completed within a month A prescribed format for submitting the feedback and suggestions has been uploaded on the website of each district, according to the official. The feedback and views have to be submitted before the evening of July 31. All the districts are collecting feedback from the stakeholders. The revaluation of the circle rates will be carried out for the various classes of properties, labelled as A to H categories. The post-reassessment rate of properties could increase different percentages across different categories of properties, as has happened after every revaluation. The circle rates are highest in A category of properties, like those in Greater Kailash and Vasant Kunj, while in the H category the circle rates of properties are the lowest among all the circles. Currently, the circle rate for an A category of property is Rs 7.7 lakh per square metre, while that for an H category of property is Rs 23,280 per square metre. In February, Delhi government offered a 20% rebate on the circle rates of properties in residential, commercial and industrial categories in a bid to revive economic activity in the real-estate sector, the sale and purchase of properties having declined due to Covid-19. The government believed that lowering of circle rates would encourage more transactions in real estate and prevent stagnation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/review-of-circle-rate-put-into-motion-after-10-years/articleshow/84773232.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: After SC win on non-Covid rates, hospitals to file plea against new registration rules||NAGPUR: After winning against the state government’s dictat to cap non-Covid treatment rates in the apex court, Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) and Dr Pradeep Arora are now set to file a petition in the high court against the new hospital rules enforced by Maharashtra through a notification earlier this year. The government has increased the registration fee for hospitals manifold (as much as 50-100 times), with many other impractical obligations that are going to have an escalatory impact on cost of healthcare. A notification in this regard was issued in January this year. After Covid-19 second wave has receded, the government is intending to implement these regulations. “Registration fee has been hiked from earlier Rs250 for the entire hospital to a whooping Rs1,000 for each bed in hospital. This indirect burden will have to be borne by patients. We will appeal in the court against this,” said Dr Anup Marar, convener of VHA. This fee means a decent hospital with 50 beds will have to pay Rs50,000 per year for mere registration and renewal of the same. New hospital rules also include a wide range of structural norms like entry and exit points, fire safety, parking etc, which are very difficult to implement retrospectively for functioning hospitals. “Our main objection against the new hospital rules is that these are very demanding and harsh, and yet the hospital owners have not been involved or consulted while forming them,” said Dr Marar. According to Dr Arora, the rights of doctors have been violated again by making harsh rules and not taking into consideration their limitations and constraints. “The huge increase in registration fee, non-feasible obligations and needless norms are bound to make private healthcare more expensive and unreachable for the poor patients. The new rules are especially burdensome for smaller nursing homes, many of which are now likely to close down,” he said. Recently, VHA and Dr Arora fought state governments’ notification and legislation that denied doctors their fundamental right to charge their prices for services rendered to non-Covid patients. After Nagpur bench of Bombay high court quashed it, the government had approached the Supreme Court to reverse the judgement. The SLP has been dismissed by the Supreme Court too. Confident doctors are now going for another battle against the new hospital rules. “Some doctors even call these rules as death knell for small and medium nursing homes. There are so many ambiguities in the rules, leaving big scope for unfavourable interpretations and inference. As a result doctors are going to be exploited and may even fall victim to corruption. The bigger hospitals also find many of these conditions restraining and onerous, thus hampering the objective of affordable and accessible healthcare,” said Dr Ashok Arbat, chairman of VHA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-sc-win-on-non-covid-rates-hospitals-to-file-plea-against-new-regn-rules/articleshow/84773176.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||India||BJP’s southern star, four-time CM never lasted a full term||BENGALURU: Hotseat took on a new meaning whenever BS Yediyurappa assumed the high office of chief minister. Every time, it has been an “agni pariksha”, triggered by political upheaval, graft charges or natural calamities. So though he single-handedly managed to form a BJP government in the south for the first time, and brought it to office another three times, he never completed a full term in office. In all, Yediyurappa kept the chair for just 5 years, 2 months and 9 days. These include the seven days during his first term in November 2007 and three days in May 2018. While he never had a stable government, due to lack of majority, it did not help that dissidence had become a norm in the party. Monday’s mid-term resignation was his fourth since becoming the chief minister for the first time in 2007. He first resigned days after taking over as CM when JD(S) withdrew support to BJP by breaking the 20:20 power-sharing pact. However, it helped his cause as BJP managed to return to office in 2008, crying betrayal. Yediyurappa had to step down in 2011 after he was indicted by then Lokayukta Justice Santosh N Hegde in his report on illegal mining. It was his longest tenure — three years and two months. In 2018, Karnataka turned in a fractured mandate and BJP, led by Yediyurappa, again fell short of simple majority with 104 MLAs. Though Congress and JD(S) had formed a post-poll alliance, then Governor Vajubhai R Vala chose to invite Yediyurappa to form the government and prove his majority. He stepped down in three days. Though he began his fourth stint on a fiery note, the unprecedented floods that hit 25 of the state’s 30 districts swamped his first three months. He had to manage the show single-handedly as the party brass did not greenlight a cabinet expansion. If there’s some satisfaction he can draw as he exits, it is that he virtually decimated the opposition these two years, even bagging a majority of the bypolls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjps-southern-star-four-time-cm-never-lasted-a-full-term/articleshow/84778546.cms||ManuAiyappa Kanathanda

The alleged abuse—which occurred three years ago—came to light when the victim’s mother took them to a child psychologist. The accused is a native of Warangal and is currently residing at Jubilee Hills. In 2003, he married a woman from Venkatagiri in Jubilee Hills and they lived in the US till 2010, where he was working. According to Jubilee Hills inspector S Rajasekhar Reddy, the couple returned to India in 2010 and settled in Jubilee Hills along with their two children. From 2018, due to personal problems, the wife and husband started living separately. “Recently, the mother noticed that the children were emotionally not keeping well and took them to a child psychologist,” the inspector said. During the counselling, the children alleged that their father and his friend had misbehaved with them three years ago by making them remove their clothes and touching them inappropriately. The children’s mother lodged a complaint with Jubilee Hills police on Sunday.

Executive committee (EC) members of the board met in Lucknow on the day where they also spoke at length on the image of Islam being tarnished by certain people at the pretext of forced religious conversions. “The UP Population Control Draft Bill is completely unnecessary and AISPLB condemns it. Instead, the state government should focus on elevating education levels by setting up new schools and colleges and work on communal harmony in the state. We urge the Central government to clarify its stand on the Bill and the state government to reconsider the same,” said board general secretary Maulana Yasoob Abbas. “In the garb of acting against religious conversion, some people are targeting Islam which is highly condemnable. Islam does not accept conversion by force or coercion and only those are converted to Islam who accept it on their own by studying about its ideals and tenets. The religion does not permit conversion by luring others either,” added the Shia cleric.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shia-board-condemns-proposed-population-control-draft-bill-in-up/articleshow/84775682.cms||Yusra Husain

Decks seem to have been cleared for the ambitious redevelopment project as the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd (IRSDC) has invited Request for Qualification (RFQ) for the transformation of the two railway stations. According to IRSDC, the redeveloped Surat railway station will have walkways and central concourse to help passengers travel smoothly between the railway station and Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation (GSRTC) bus station, city bus terminal, proposed metro train station and other areas. Udhna railway station too will be redeveloped with better connectivity and different concourses for departing and arriving passengers. The redeveloped Surat station will also ease congestion at the existing premises as it will balance the utilization of the area on eastern and western sides and also boost economic activities. The new station will be redeveloped to handle the increase in the number of passengers, which is likely to double in the coming years. “The stations will be redeveloped in lines with global standards to transform them at par with international airports and provide world-class amenities to travellers. The Surat railway station is envisaged to be redeveloped into a multi-modal transport hub (MMTH), thus providing a hassle-free and comfortable travel experience to the commuters,” said SK Lohia, MD and CEO, IRSDC. Surat station will be an MMTH as the Indian Railways, GSRTC and Surat Municipal Corporation have come together to pool their lands for the Rs 1,285 crore project. IRSDC will redevelop the stations on behalf of a special purpose vehicle – Surat Integrated Transportation Development Corporation Limited (SITCO) – a joint venture of IRSDC, GSRTC and SMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-udhna-stations-to-be-redeveloped-as-railpolis/articleshow/84770657.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Special development body to be formed for temple surroundings||HYDERABAD: The state government has decided to form a special development authority to preserve and regulate the area around Ramappa temple which was designated as a world heritage site on Sunday by UNESCO. It’s the first site in Telangana to get that tag. In the management plan submitted to Unesco, the department of heritage said that the new authority would constitute stakeholders from all departments to develop the area around the 13th century Shaivite temple also called Rudreshwara temple. It is likely to be named as Palampet Development Authority or Ramappa Development Authority. While the main property will be under Archaeological Survey of India’s (ASI) control, the special development area will constitute Ramappa and other temples, agricultural fields of Palampet village, reserve forest and Ramappa lake. The buffer zone, part of area under the nominated property, falls under the prohibited and regulated zone. The zone is regulated by National Monument Authority rules. The conservation and management plan is prepared at various levels: Warangal-Mulugu tourism development; proposed special development area; and main property level by integrating the efforts by various stakeholders involved in maintaining the temple’s outstanding universal value. “The temple is located amidst an agricultural field in Palampet which was once an important town during the Kakatiya period. It gets around 1 lakh tourists annually, including pilgrims and schoolchildren. This number goes to 2 lakh during Medaram Jathara celebrations,” an official said. A heritage village is also being planned along National Highway 163 spread over 10 hectares to accommodate visitors. The village will involve local communities where festivals, cuisines and handicrafts of Telangana region will be showcased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/special-development-body-to-be-formed-for-temple-surroundings/articleshow/84775295.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Hyderabad||Multiple heritage value bldgs demolished in recent years||Hyderabad: At a time when the state government is aiming for a world heritage city status for Hyderabad, turns out several heritage value structures have been demolished during the last few years. TOI identified at least four such structures pulled down from various parts of the city, even as GHMC officials could not provide any consolidated data on it. The latest in this string of demolitions was that of 135-year-old Asman Garh Palace in Malakpet. On July 18, a large part of the southern side of the palace adjoining a mosque was pulled down, allegedly under the direction of St Joseph’s School, which has been running its campus on the palace’s premises since 2000. “Even if it is purchased by a private entity, the Asman Garh Palace is among the protected heritage structures of Hyderabad that cannot be demolished,” said Anuradha Reddy, co-convenor, Intach-Hyderabad. Similarly, in June this year, GHMC demolished part of Amberpet Sarai, a rest house constructed for travellers during the Qutub Shahi period, for road widening.While GHMC officials have agreed to have demolished the structure for road widening, they said they have acquired all necessary permissions from Waqf board. “It is a Waqf board property and they have given us the consent after receiving a compensation check...due process has been followed,” said B Narsing Rao, assistant city planner, Secunderabad Zone. Waqf board officials, however, said that they have to check if it is a notified structure. The G block of Saifabad palace and Nizam-era Bela Kaman have also met a similar fate despite concerns raised by the heritage activists in the city. “If the government is saying that the next goal is to get a world heritage status for Hyderabad, then they have to back it with a very strong plan for restoration and revival of all heritage structures. ,” said Deepak Kant Gir, managing trustee, Hyderabad Heritage Trust. “The heritage tag works wonders when it comes to boosting tourism to the place. So, they should take heritage very seriously,” he added. “We do not demolish any structure that is a listed heritage property. There is a list of 137 such structures. In some cases, if we need to demolish an old heritage value structure, and since there is no heritage committee, the government takes a decision” said GHMC’s deputy city planner K Mallikarjuna Rao said.

Akhil Goa Kshatriya Pagi Samaj president Ashok Dhuri visited the beach along with a group of members to take stock of the damage caused to the beach. Dhuri told TOI that more than 30 metres of the beach has washed away and about five houses are at risk if the beach gets damaged more. He also said that if another 12-15 metres of beach gets washed away, the course of the sea will change, the five dwellings can get affected. Pagi said that Galgibaga panch member Diksha Daya Pagi has informed authorities about the danger from the erosion at the beach. The erosion of the beach was expected after similar episodes during Cyclone Vayu and more specifically, Cyclone Tauktae breached the sandbar in mid-May. “The erosion has become prominent now after the last cyclone which had knocked off nearly 100 trees in comparison to 25 recently. If the trend continues, with another spell of rain or a cyclone, the remaining trees protecting the beach will be completely uprooted,”FM Nadaf, senior geographer and environmentalist said. The high-tide line has temporarily shifted to a higher level and even the sand dune vegetation, Ipomeia - a sand binder, has been destroyed by erosion, Nadaf said, adding, “Measures to protect the beach from further erosion is a must.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/erosion-at-galgibaga-beach-worsens-houses-at-risk/articleshow/84773236.cms||---
---||Mumbai||More potholes scar Mumbai roads this year; mix used to fix craters ‘washes away’||MUMBAI: Following spells of heavy rain, pothole complaints have made a comeback this year. Motorists said with local trains off-limits, they are forced to commute by roads, many of which have developed multiple craters, thereby making the ride bumpy and dangerous, especially for bikers. Data from the BMC’s pothole tracking website shows an almost 40% increase in the number of craters reported this June-July by citizens compared with the corresponding months of the previous year. If last year, in June-July, the BMC’s website http://www.mybmcpotholefixit.com/ had reported 315 potholes, this year, till July 26, 437 craters cropped up. Of these, 262 have been attended to. TimesViewThe BMC’s inability to provide good roads is largely due to shoddy, inferior quality work done by contractors appointed by the civic administration. Heavy rains can damage roads in any global city facing nature’s wrath, but in Mumbai it is mainly due to lack of supervision and the BMC’s helplessness in holding those responsible for the potholes accountable. Citizen volunteers, local ALMs and residents’ groups too should be alert, monitor road repair works and raise a noise against errant contractors.Mahim resident Mushtaq Ansari, who runs the Twitter handle @PotholeWarriors, said every year they get complaints about potholes and this year has been no different. “In the past few days, we have received complaints from parts of Andheri, Kandivli and Kurla. The number of potholes on roads not only point towards poor road quality but can also can be damaging to vehicles, thereby causing financial loss to motorists, said Ansari. Pothole complaints are expected to be attended to by ward level officials. In case these roads fall in the defect liability period (DLP), the concerned contractor is expected to attend to them. Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria said pothole filling gets washed away in no time. “While the BMC comes to attend to the complaints, the problem is that the material used to fill them does not last. At the ward level, the BMC uses hot mix to fill the potholes while cold mix is sent in from the civic body’s central department. Neither, though, is able to withstand the rains or continuous movement of vehicles,” said Zakaria, adding the maximum complaints have come for asphalt roads constructed over the past two to three years. Marine Drive resident Mahendra Hemdev said while in their area he has not noticed any potholes, the problem is pronounced in the suburbs. “In Santacruz, for instance, I did notice many. These can be fatal even if small.” Shantanu Kulkarni, director, Probity Soft, the firm which operates the BMC website, said perhaps fewer complaints were reported last year as the city was learning to deal with the pandemic and and reporting potholes was not a priority. “We may be hence witnessing a rise in complaints this year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-more-potholes-scar-city-roads-this-yr-mix-used-to-fix-craters-washes-away/articleshow/84769649.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Hyderabad||Temple gives a detailed peak at dances of the era||HYDERABAD: Ramappa deserves the world heritage status but its potential was recognised by Kakaitya Heritage Trust (KHT). Immediately after becoming advisor to the chief minister, BV Papa Rao, who is also a KHT trustee, congregated scholars with expertise in related subjects and held several rounds of discussions and planning in 2015-16 to prepare a dossier proposing Ramappa’s potential to the Unesco’s World Heritage Convention. The dossier was moved by the state’s ministry of tourism and culture through ASI in 2016. Thereafter, several ministers from the state held deliberations with the Union government to shortlist Ramappa Temple for status of World Heritage from India. It is the first site from the two Telugu states to achieve this status and I would like to congratulate the entire Telangana fraternity and express my gratitude to BV Papa Rao who made me part of this project. Among the great features of Ramappa are the bracket figures of dancers. Gulam Yazdani, the first director of archaeology department of erstwhile Hyderabad State wrote in 1953’s History of the Deccan, Part – VIII, that “the art of dancing reached its high-water mark in the Deccan in the thirteenth century A.D… Emotional gestures, which are an essential adjunct of the art of dancing in India, are shown with much effect in these representations.” Thereafter, Dr. Nataraja Ramakrishna studied the dance sculptures and revived the lost Perini dance of Kakatiya period. But what are those sculptures in Ramappa? The question is answered by Ms Vidya Shimladka in Nartanam (Vol. XVIII-1). She identified 12 sculptures depicted as performing two types of dance positions and three types of dances – Sthanakas, Chari, Perini, Gaundali, Danda Rasaka Ramappa is not only known for light vehicles, sand box technology, symphony stones, etc but is also equally important for great dance traditions of India in general and Telangana in particular.

Along with Dholavira, Hawaraman from Iran, Jomon from Japan, As-Salt from Jordan and Nice from France are in the race. The ongoing session has already gifted India a new WHS in the form of the Rudreswara/ Ramappa Temple in Telangana, which dates back to the 13th century. Gujarat so far has three World Heritage Sites — Champaner near Pavagadh, Rani ki Vav in Patan and the historic city of Ahmedabad. The state and country are eyeing another bit of history in the making, experts said. Dr Y S Rawat, former director of the state archaeology department and one of the team members that found the city which dates back to between 3000 BCE and 1800 BCE, said no Harappan-era site in India has so far got this status. “The chance of its selection is high due to its uniqueness, and if it gets the status, it will transform the region,” he said. Dr R S Bisht, the archaeologist who led the team that excavated the site two decades ago, said the site has given so much insight into the past with its 1,200 years of continuous habitation. “Right from construction technology to water conservation and weights to trade, it’s a time capsule to understand our past,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dholavira-in-race-for-whs-tag-today/articleshow/84773375.cms||---

In hindsight, Deepa Sharma’s pinned tweet had a prophetic ring to it, “I am not a IAS/IPS, IIM, Ivy League school pass out, any celebrity or any politician, but I am confident. In few years, people will know my name very well for my good work and my professional attributes for our Nation and for #WomenEmpowerment.” A day after her death in the landslide in Himachal’s Kinnaur that killed eight other tourists on Sunday, the Jaipur-based Ayurveda practitioner’s life was celebrated as much as her passing was mourned by 22.4k Twitter followers and thousands of others moved by the tragedy. Deepa, 34, had bought a DSLR and a new mobile just ahead of the solo trip so she could indulge in her passion for nature photography and document every little detail for her website drdeepasharma.com. “She was planning to celebrate her 35th birthday on July 29 at Spiti,” said Deepa's sister-in-law Kavita Sharma as the family waited in Delhi on Monday for the body to arrive. Actor Kangana Ranaut, whom Deepa had met more than a couple of times, was among those who paid tributes. “She was a great fan, she sent me lovely letters and showered me with gifts and sweets...also visited my house in Manali... Oh !!! Seems like a big jolt… This is beyond tragic... Oh, God!!!" she wrote. Those close to Deepa recalled her as a vivacious, independent and fiercely opinionated person on women's issues, politics and society. During the peak of the pandemic, she would help whoever was in distress in every way she could, her family and friends said. “Besides being a good photographer, her Hindi poetry was evocative. She once wrote, ‘Zindagi kisey kehte hain jo waqt ke saath behti jaaye ya jisse waqt baha le jaaye (Life is what flows with time or what time washes away)'. Time has indeed taken her away,” said a friend from her Shanti Nagar neighbourhood. Deepa's penultimate tweet was, “Life is nothing without Mother Nature”. Moments before nature unleashed her fury the next day, she posted what would be the final picture, showing her next to a signboard of the Indo Tibetan Border Police Force and “standing at the last point of India where civilians are allowed”. She would have wanted people to “know my name” in some other way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/wave-of-grief-for-deepa-sharma-who-lived-died-in-lap-of-nature/articleshow/84775698.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Nagpur||Dengue spreading fast, platelet, blood component shortage hits hosps||NAGPUR: With dengue cases on the rise, blood banks have started facing a shortage of platelet components. Lack of blood and blood component donations during the lockdown phase is one of the major causes for this shortage. Secondly, only select blood banks have component separation units to retrieve platelets. Hospitals treating dengue patients have noted a rise in demand and difficulty in getting platelets. This shortage could prove serious if dengue cases continue to increase at the present pace. “Our platelets requirement increased last week. It has become difficult to get platelets on time from the blood banks. Generally, we ask for single donor platelets (SDP), which give better results. But, banks are finding it difficult to provide SDPs,” said Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease specialist. Critical care specialist Dr Sohal Parate said dengue is more prevalent in paediatric population this time. “Platelet requirement is limited but it might increase in coming days. Blood banks provide platelets on replacement donor basis. However, needy patients should get platelets immediately,” he said. At Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), there is a sharp increase in demand of platelet components but GMCH blood bank has managed to provide them at least till Sunday. Other blood banks in city are facing testing times. Dr Sheela Mundhada of Jeevan Jyoti Blood Bank said the demand has gone up. “Dengue cases are at two-year high so demand of platelets is more. Voluntary blood donations and component donations must be promoted in these testing times,” she said. Dr Mundhada also appealed to dengue patients not to wait for long and get tested immediately so that they do not need platelets. Ashok Patki, secretary of Dr Hegdewar Blood Bank, said they had to call voluntary donors more often in last two weeks. “Fortunately, we have a big database of donors. Platelet donation is a regular activity for our bank as we are attached to leading cancer hospitals in city. We are trying to get SDPs preferably, as they are good for patients,” said Patki. The only solution to the present and future crisis is voluntary donation, said Dr Harish Warbhe of Lifeline Blood Bank. “As platelet demand is up sharply, we need more platelet donors to come forward. It’s scientifically safer to have platelets from voluntary donor rather than replacement donors,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dengue-spreading-fast-platelet-blood-component-shortage-hits-hosps/articleshow/84773230.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Civil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar, ST welfare minister Satyavathi Rathod, MLC Pochampally Srinivas Reddy and other leaders from TRS, who also visited the temple on Monday, offered prayers and inspected the area. Jubilant locals burst crackers and offered sweets to the ministers. Rathod alleged that the temple was neglected in united Andhra Pradesh and the ministers lauded chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for his efforts. Kakatiya Heritage Trust (KHT) founder trustee and retired IAS officer B V Papa Rao told reporters that KHT’s efforts over the decade and its dossier to ICOMOS were crucial in getting the heritage tag. Rao said that he along with KHT members prof Panduranga Rao and Suryanarayana Murthy had made a presentation in Ramappa’s favour in front of about 30 international experts of ICOMOS in Paris in November 2019. Rao added that it was all made possible finally thanks to the efforts of CM KCR, India’s ambassador to Unesco, Vishal Sharma, and Union ministers G Kishan Reddy and Meenakshi Lekhi.

---||Mumbai||Seek mediation, Bombay HC advises Yusuf Lakdawala’s second wife & kids||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday suggested that builder Yusuf Lakdawala’s second wife and children from his first marriage opt for mediation to settle their disputes. “We only propose you go for mediation as there are allegations and counter-allegations. It may not be a happy state of affairs in the family. The allegations are not in good taste,” said a bench of Justices Prasanna Varale and Nitin Borkar. They heard a petition by Sabina Lakdawala (47), including for police protection and to quash an FIR against her. Sabina’s petition says while modelling she came in contact with Lakdawala. Their marriage in December 2007 was received with hostility by his son, daughter-in-law and two daughters. At the time of her marriage, she was 34 and Lakdawalla was 61 years, “though he had misrepresented himself to be 52 years”. Sabina’s petition says Lakdawala built an “empire worth over Rs 1,000 crore” and set up 15 companies to run his business. He had assured her equal rights in his properties and she also helped him in matters of business, the petition stated. With the economic offences wing and the enforcement directorate instituting cases against Lakdawalla, who is in prison and ailing with prostate cancer, his children are putting pressure on him to transfer his assets to them, it added. The judges said the parties must go before “a third party, a respectable senior mediator”, due to the nature of the allegations and as the matter could go on indefinitely. Sabina’s advocates, Mathews Nedumpara and Rohini Amin, welcomed the suggestion for mediation, saying it will “resolve the issue instead of going for protracted litigation”. The judges said their suggestion is “only for the reason that it will not have bitterness between parties’’ and they must “hope for a better outcome”. Advocate Asadali Mazgaonwala, for Lakdawala’s children, said he would take instructions from them and inform the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-seek-mediation-hc-advises-lakdawalas-second-wife-kids/articleshow/84770333.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Hyderabad||After Ramappa, calls grow to save Hyderabad heritage bldgs||HYDERABAD: Buoyed with the world heritage tag for Ramappa Temple, the Telangana government’s next target is to get world heritage city status for Hyderabad. But many buildings, which have features of heritage buildings, especially in the Old City have been vanishing over past few decades. Efforts to safeguard such buildings have been minimal and in place of 100 year-old buildings, new developments are coming up. GHMC records show that, on an average, the civic body gives 15,000 new building permissions a year. Of them about 600 to 800 applications are from Charminar zone. Conservation architects and historians say the government should take a lead to protect such old buildings. There was a proposal by GHMC to give 50% concession in property tax for buildings that have heritage characteristics as part of Charminar Pedestrianisation Project (CPP) but this was not approved by the state government. “The proposal was sent in 2010-11 after a joint meeting with GHMC and tourism department, mainly to encourage the owners to protect their buildings and carry out small repairs without disturbing the main structure. However, it was not implemented as it requires GHMC Act amendment,” former chief city planner, Syed Muzaffer Hussain, told TOI. Many heritage buildings are in a dilapidated condition and require repair and renovation. Maintenance of these heritage structures is an expensive affair but many property owners are either small traders or employees, and are not able to maintain them, one GHMC official informed. Interestingly, municipal minister KT Rama Rao in March 2017 had announced in the assembly that the state would help owners of private heritage building to maintain the structures. He had said an escrow account would be opened for heritage buildings where property tax paid by the owners would be deposited. The GHMC would also release a matching amount for maintaining the structures. However, the proposal remains on paper. Conservation architect and urban planner Vasanta Sobha Turaga said the city qualifies to get world heritage city status. “I had made a proposal in 2002 by preparing the city’s dossier by dividing it into 10 clusters and sent it to Centre through the state. It could not be considered by the Unseco as the government has to prepare proposals with minute details of the city. Later another proposal was sent by government by incorporating some structures in 2006,” Turaga said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-ramappa-calls-grow-to-save-city-heritage-bldgs/articleshow/84775034.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Palampet was a city in Kakatiya era: Inscriptions||Hyderabad: Kakatiya inscriptions at Ramappa Temple reveal that Palampet, which is currently an obscure village, was an important city during the Kakatiya period. The inscription, found on the four cases of the quadrangular pillar of a polished black basalt at the temple’s north-east side, has been dated to 1213 AD. The city was built by Kakatiya Ganapati’s general, Recerala Rudra while the temple was constructed by General Rudra at Rudreswara, then called Athukuru. “The inscription pillar is located inside the shasana mandapa of the complex. It is a text composed in 54 verses, written on all four sides of the pillar. This epigraph explains the establishment of the temple by General Rudra...,”said archaeologist Dr E Sivanagi Reddy said. Meanwhile, the GSI Science Branch has undertaken scientific studies to analyse the issues and find out best remedial conservation measures. Petrographic study of stone samples of the monument of Ramappa was carried out in the laboratory of Geological Survey of India, Hyderabad to determine the mineral composition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/palampet-was-a-city-in-kakatiya-era-inscriptions/articleshow/84775327.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: ASI to rectify defects in Ramappa structures||HYDERABAD: World heritage site Rudreshwara (Ramappa) Temple has significant threats of damage, natural spoilage and other defects. In the management plan submitted to Unesco, the state said that the Archaeological Survey of India is working to rectify the defects at the temple complex. The structural analysis, conducted by a team from National Institute of Technology, Warangal, has found that floor beams resting on the sand have been subjected to tensile strength which is far less than stress developed due to the superstructure. “This is the primary reason for all broken floor beams that have been observed. The floor beams, having large cross-sections made up of sandstones, have failed severely, resulting in settlement of all four major load-bearing dolerite pillars,” archaeologist Dr E Siva Nagi Reddy said. “Kameswara Temple is being restored using the same building elements with little modified structural stability and quality control adopting the ancient construction procedure,” he added. The sikhara — upper part of the main temple — is made up of floating bricks, overlaid with stucco. Nagi Reddy said that the deposition of dried moss and other micro-vegetation caused an unpleasant appearance and weakening of the stucco surface. “The probable cause is due to the impact of humidity and rainfall, thick micro-vegetation growth occurred, which caused deterioration of stucco surface,” the heritage department said. Hard lichen growth on the stone surface of temple’s exterior vertical wall was causing deterioration due to the secretion of acids. Nandi mandapa, kitchen, Kateswara temple were made up of red sandstone with white bands, probably procured from nearby hills. The exterior wall of the main temple has been impacted due to humidity and rainfall, and thick micro-vegetation growth. The exterior wall of Nandi Mandap has the presence of remnants of previously applied lime patches. Lime marks and the presence of lime remnants were seen. The ceiling of antechamber has soot deposits in the interior of the temple.“Burning of oil lamps, camphor, incense sticks etc., led to deposition of soot on the interior walls and ceiling. Disfiguring of the sculptures was found at the exterior wall of the temple and sub-shrines, it has occurred due to the impact of the atmospheric vagaries, and inherent nature of building material, stone sculptures eroded causing disfigurement,” the heritage department said in the management plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/asi-to-rectify-defects-in-ramappa-structures/articleshow/84775009.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Nagpur||Bawankule denies role in ‘attempt’ to topple Jharkhand govt||NAGPUR: Former Maharashtra energy minister and state BJP general secretary Chandrashekhar Bawankule denied media reports about his involvement in trying to topple Jharkhand government by enticing some MLAs with monetary gains. After a case was registered in Jharkhand, a Hindi daily reported that accused Abhishek Dubey had named Bawankule along with other politicians and a businessman from Maharashtra. Some of the people named in the news report included BJP leader Charan Singh Thakur and businessman Jaykumar Belkhede. Thakur had contested 2019 assembly election against former home minister Anil Deshmukh, while Belkhede has business interests in Katol. A livid Bawankule said such allegations are figments of imagination. “I have never been to Jharkhand in my entire life and do not know anything about that state. Do you think I am such a big person to topple an elected state government? It’s something beyond imagination and I do not know why such allegations are being made. Regardless, let the police continue with investigation and truth will be out,” said Bawankule. Thakur too expressed shock that his name has cropped up in the Jharkhand case. “Frankly, I am amused that someone would consider me so strong and mighty. I am a very small level politician and my party work is limited to Katol. I have absolutely no connections to Jharkhand. In fact, I have never been there. I doubt if people in Delhi have even heard about me,” said Thakur. When asked about businessman Belkhede, the BJP politician confirmed that they both are acquaintances. “Belkhede has a coaching centre in Katol and travels a lot to get students for it. Apart from that, I do not know how his name also cropped up here,” said Thakur. TOI was unable to get in touch with Belkhede. As per the media report which published accused Dubey’s revelations, a meeting took place in New Delhi on July 16 between three MLAs from Jharkhand and ‘politicians from Maharashtra’. Thakur said they were in Delhi on that date, but denied meeting anybody. “I had gone there on July 15 and returned the next day in the evening. Bawankule and I had an appointment with Union minister of state for railways Raosaheb Danve and that was the purpose of my visit,” said Thakur. Bawankule too confirmed visiting New Delhi and said, “I met newly appointed Union ministers from Maharashtra as part of a courtesy visit. I read in an online report that we are being accused of trying to get three MLAs to defect. Look at the Jharkhand assembly strength and tell me if three MLAs can cause a government to fall.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bawankule-denies-role-in-attempt-to-topple-jkhand-govt/articleshow/84773281.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Failure to desilt dams till date impacting flood risk||KERI: One of the more significant reasons behind the flooding witnessed in the state in recent years following concentrated spells of heavy showers is the failure of the water resources department (WRD) to desilt the dams. Deforestation taking place in catchment areas of dams in the upstream reaches is leading to siltation of the reservoirs, increasing the occurrence of flooding during monsoon in the state, department officials told TOI. Siltation reduces a dam’s storage capacity which causes a heavy flow of water to gush downstream during the monsoon. Anjunem in Sattari, Amthane in Bicholim, Selaulim in Sanguem and Tillari in Maharashtra have not been desilted ever since their completion. “WRD can earn revenue by selling fertile earth and sand from the submergence area by way of auction. Desilted sand is useful in construction activity, which can fetch high revenue since there is shortage of river sand due to the high court ban on sand mining. Desilting has to be done in a scientific and not haphazard manner,” said a WRD official on conditions of anonymity. Other contributing factors are reduced widths of rivers and non-maintenance of bandharas. Due to encroachments, the width of rivers has reduced at many places and such bottlenecks reduce free flow of water. In some areas of Sattari, non-maintenance of bundhs, siltation from iron ore mining and laterite and meta-basalt quarries has intensified flooding. “Maintenance of open type bandharas constructed by the WRD is not done. Floating debris such as huge trees stuck between the piers of the bundhs, are not removed immediately. Neither supervisors nor engineers of WRD are serious and no proper watch is kept,” resident of Honda-Sattari Gautam Zalmi said. On Saturday, WRD minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues along with WRD engineers visited the Selaulim dam and directed officials to undertake necessary flood mitigation measures at the earliest. Recently, the department has also floated tenders for desilting the Anjunem and Selaulim reservoirs post-monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/failure-to-desilt-dams-till-date-impacting-flood-risk/articleshow/84773278.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Ahmedabad||Seven more units to make remdesivir in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: To scale up manufacturing capacity of remdesivir, the state government recently gave its approval to seven more units to manufacture the antiviral drug used to treat Covid-19 patients. This will take the total number of remdesivir manufacturing units in Gujarat to 21, from the 14 units approved before the second wave of Covid-19, according to the Gujarat Food and Drug Control Administration (FDCA). “We recently gave approval to seven more units to manufacture remdesivir. These include six under Cadila Healthcare Limited and one of Lincoln Pharmaceuticals. Gujarat already has some 14 units manufacturing remdesivir, for domestic use and export and this will ramp up capacity,” said H G Koshia, commissioner, FDCA, Gujarat. The government of India banned the export of remdesivir on April 11, to meet growing demand for the drug during the second wave of Covid-19 infections. The new units under Cadila Healthcare Limited include the facilities of Amneal Pharmaceuticals and German Remedies in Ahmedabad; Gufic Biosciences Limited at Navsari; Elsiyum Pharmaceuticals in Vadodara; Abaris Pharmaceuticals in Mehsana and Zen Pharma Private Limited in Vapi. Shortages of remdesivir were reported in Gujarat during the second wave, particularly in the second week of April, as Covid cases began to peak, according to sources in the Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists’ Associations (FGSCDA). “We did face short-supply of the medicine in April and May because the number of daily cases shot up drastically. Moreover, remdesivir was not just hoarded but also indiscriminately prescribed,” said a top FGSCDA official on condition of anonymity. FDCA data suggests that in April and May, 17.65 lakh vials of remdesivir were distributed across Gujarat. During this period, 4.99 lakh Covid-19 cases were reported in Gujarat. “The additional manufacturing capacity has been set up as part of the state’s preparedness for the projected third wave of Covid-19 infections. With more units, the state will be better equipped,” said Koshia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/7-more-units-to-make-remdesivir/articleshow/84773285.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Ahmedabad||Will Ahmedabad go the Liverpool way?||AHMEDABAD: Liverpool in England, once a ‘mercantile maritime city,’ was awarded World Heritage City status by Unesco in 2004. In 2012, the city was warned that the status may be revoked, and in 2021, large infrastructural projects cost the city the status as it was revoked. Ahmedabad prided itself exactly four years ago when it was awarded India’s first Unesco World Heritage City tag in July 2017. Four years on, with the inspection due, the city authorities are still scurrying to put the paperwork in place. Highly placed sources told TOI that the last meeting of the city’s heritage cell and top AMC officials with representatives of the Delhi-based National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) was stormy, with AMC officials unhappy with the shape of the development plan. “The agency is still on board till the end of the year, but the authorities made it clear that the work so far is not as expected, and they would have to pull up their socks. The agency is entrusted with preparing a detailed conservation and heritage management plan. The plan will decide if the status is retained or lost,” said a senior official privy to the developments. “In all practicality, the AMC has decided to build its own capacity to carry out this work.” Senior officials remained silent on the issue, saying the matter is in progress and it would not be right to comment. Heritage experts said that if the city fails to qualify, it could be put in the ‘Red category’ of Unesco, which indicates ‘Heritage at Risk.’ It could have long-term implications not only for the city, but also for the country. Shikha Jain, a conservation architect who has been on several national and international boards for heritage, said both Ahmedabad and Jaipur are in the same boat. “There was apprehension when the status was awarded, given the unique challenges to Indian cities. But the cities convinced the committee that they would work towards ironing out issues. The documentation required works as the roadmap,” she said. “For Ahmedabad, I believe people’s participation is a key aspect.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/will-ahmedabad-go-the-liverpool-way/articleshow/84773296.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Two accused undergo potency tests in 3-month-old’s gang rape & murder||MUMBAI: Cuffe Parade police, through doctors at J J Hospital, recently conducted potency tests on two accused, including a transgender, who were arrested in connection with the alleged kidnapping, gang rape and murder of a three-month-old girl by burying her alive in a marshy land. The results are awaited. A potency test is conducted to ascertain whether an accused arrested in a rape case is capable of engaging in sexual act or not. Meanwhile, police also said they had sought appointment of a special public prosecutor to represent the case. On July 9, the accused transgender, identified as Kanu, and an associate, Sonu, were arrested within 10 hours of the kidnapping. They were initially booked for murder and destruction of evidence. The post-mortem report found certain injuries near the infant’s private parts. Police thereafter added sections of gang rape and invoked Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. The post-mortem also stated the girl died due to drowning. The accused are currently in judicial custody. Police have collected their blood samples and said they will conduct a DNA test to determine sexual assault.  Police added they were trying to bring the case to the fast-track court for trial. Kanu reportedly told police he learnt about the birth of the child and went to her parents in the Ambedkar Nagar slum to ask for gifts and Rs 1,100 bakshish on July 8. The family refused and asked him to leave. This allegedly enraged Kanu who along with Sonu kidnapped the infant.

Unsurprisingly then, coffee exporters of Telangana have been busier than ever in Covid times. While coffee is not grown in Telangana, exports happen from the state. During FY21, the state witnessed a 54% rise in coffee exports at $20 million as compared to $13 million in FY20. What is interesting is that Telangana’s coffee exports, though on a smaller base, grew despite a dip in the national coffee exports, revealed global trade finance company Drip Capital Inc in its latest report. As per the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) data, India exported coffee worth nearly $720 million in FY21 as compared to $739 million in FY20. As of 2020, the global coffee market was valued at around $466 billion. “One of the reasons for a significant growth in Telangana’s coffee exports can be attributed to the rise in instant coffee exports to West Africa from the state, which jumped from $2 million in FY20 to $6 million in FY21. In general, Telangana exported its instant coffee to a higher number of Western African countries in FY21 than it did in FY20,” a Drip Capital spokesperson said. Meanwhile, the dip in the national coffee exports happened partly due to Covid-19, wherein in FY20, India’s overall coffee exports sank to a nine-year low in dollar value terms and plummeted by 44% in April 2020. Moreover, the crisis significantly affected green coffee beans shipments in March 2020, which is the crucial period for Robusta coffee harvesting and exports, he explained. However, even before the pandemic, the Indian coffee industry had been witnessing stagnation for a while due to a growing need for value addition across multiple stages of coffee processing. As per the report, while environmental changes have been one of the reasons for low and delayed coffee production in India, many other elements, especially on the processing front, can be improved to promote India’s coffee exports. The report also pointed out that as the intensity of the pandemic grew, the demand for coffee from large restaurants and cafe chains kept declining while that from retailers for home consumption rose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amid-pandemic-telangana-brews-54-rise-in-coffee-exports/articleshow/84777364.cms||Swati Rathor

The demolition was carried out following complaints from neighbours who feared that the structure was likely to collapse. CCP unsuccessfully tried to contact the owners. CCP commissioner Angelo Fernandes said the roof had collapsed and the entire structure would have come down. “In order to prevent further collapse, CCP knocked down the walls and removed most of the debris. This was done in the interest of the people next door, pedestrians and passers-by who park their vehicles there,” he told TOI. The house was around 100-150 years old. CCP first removed the debris at the site and then found that the walls made of mud were soaked, smelling and unstable. These were then brought down. After part of the heritage Vaz building/Monte Crist building in Panaji came down earlier this month, CCP began a fresh survey of unsafe structure. The tenants of the building who have businesses of laundry, restaurant and carpentry went to the high court alleging CCP demolished more than what had collapsed with the rains. The court on July 22 directed that the collector to convene a meeting within to consider the representations made by them. The advocate general stated that CCP officials with technical expertise will also attend the meeting since the issue of structural stability is involved. The advocate general stated that the representation of the petitioners will be heard and disposed off in accordance with law. The petitioners alleged that the torrential rains caused the southern western corner of the building to collapse following which the building stabilised and there was no further collapse or damage to the building. CCP in its defence in court stated that it carried out the work from the safety point of view.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ccp-razes-old-home-in-fontainhas/articleshow/84773309.cms||---

The board has urged that the central government must reconsider its aggressive stance towards getting the UCC implemented in the country and concentrate on real issues like education, employment, inflation, health infrastructure and political crisis, gnawing at our existence. In his video statement, board secretary and its spokesperson Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani reiterated that the country gives everyone the right to live and practise a religion of their choice. “Bringing about UCC will only come in the way of that fundamentally available right to all Indian citizens. There are more cons than any evident benefit of the UCC. It is in contradiction with the Sharia (Muslim religious laws), legal rights and also social and cultural aspects of living of different citizens in the country,” said Maulana Rahmani. “To divert from the real issues of employment and development, BJP intistigates topics which divides people. It is known that in the monsoon session of Parliament, the population control bill and UCC are to be presented as private bills. The UP government is also set to pass the population draft bill. We are strongly against these,” he added. Explaining the Sharia, legal and socio-cultural aspects of UCC, h said, “Sharia gives certain rights to Muslims which will be in contradiction with the UCC. Like polygamy is expected to be dissolved. Similarly the right to divorce will be taken away from the husband and put in the court which will exploit the woman and remove the chance of mutual and amicable divorce between the partners,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uniform-civil-code-unworkable-in-a-country-like-india/articleshow/84775738.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Lucknow||SRTC’s green leap with HFC technology||Lucknow: A bus that covers about 190km between Delhi and Agra without any emission and has only water as the waste product! What could get cleaner and greener than this for any form of fuel? The hydrogen fuel cell technology (HFC) is the latest the Union government has adopted for the cleaner and greener operation of electric buses. The technology is up for trial. The centre has selected UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) for the launch of the HFC technology as a pilot project. Countries like China, US and a few European nations have made the switchover already. In India, the ministry of petroleum and natural gas has nominated Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and a few other agencies for development, harness and pilot production, storage, distribution and usage of hydrogen cell powered electric vehicles. UPSRTC has joined IOC in the initiative. There would be ten buses operating between Delhi and Agra as a pilot. IOC would get the ten buses manufactured with an engine designed differently from the fleet existing with the corporation. The buses would be air-conditioned. In addition, there would be two hydrogen plants set up, each in Delhi and Agra to provide fuel to the buses. At the plants, hydrogen would be produced from water and methane using electrolysis. In the chemical reaction that would follow, hydrogen would be a by-product. The hydrogen would be filled in cylinders and the same would be fitted to the bus. The engine of the bus would have a converter that would produce electricity through hydrogen to generate the current and also power the battery of the electric bus. In all this, water would be a waste product. The buses will be operated on PPP mode as UPSRTC would put them on lease. “It might take about a year before we complete the trial and comment on the operational aspects,” said chief general manager (technical), UPSRTC, Jaideep Verma. The electric buses that are under operation need to be charged at charging depots. In these buses, hydrogen fuel would keep charging the battery while the vehicle is moving. The IOC, last week, had made a presentation on the technology to UPSRTC officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/srtcs-green-leap-with-hfc-technology/articleshow/84775760.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Goa||Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry: Form a task force to identify reason for annual floods||PANAJI: While urging the state government to compensate flood-affected families and farmers immediately, Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) on Monday asked chief minister Pramod Sawant to form a task force to find out the reason for the yearly floods. In a letter to Sawant, GCCI said that it is willing to support and collaborate with the government in the relief efforts. The industry body has identified short-term measures as well as long-term measures to prevent similar instances from recurring. “A task force should be set up to assess the reasons for repeated monsoon time flooding and excessive damage witnessed over the past couple of years,” said GCCI president Ralph De Sousa. Sousa said that GCCI along with government agencies and professional environmental experts could help with the report, which should be made public to educate and hold all stakeholders accountable. GCCI has said that Goa state infrastructure development corporation (GSIDC) must re-construct homes and damaged infrastructure in the villages. Along with this an “assured compensation package” must be given to those who suffered significant loss of agricultural equipment, farms and homes. Goa witnessed continuous heavy showers for more than a week which led to flooding, destruction of homes, agricultural crops and livestock. The government estimates that approximately 832 hectares of crops and around 700 homes were destroyed. Logistical support and restoration of the supply chain in the villages is also must, said Sousa. “Loss estimation of agricultural yield, livestock should be assessed by a neutral task force that can report on damage within 45 days,” he said in the letter to Sawant. As a long term corrective measure, the state needs to dredge waterways and channels, build water highways from the dams to the seas and raise river embankments where ever necessary. GCCI has also urged the state government to set up local disaster management cells across all red zones. The cells should comprise members who can actively monitor climactic changes and the resultant impact along Goa’s riverfront and rainwater catchment areas around dams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/form-a-task-force-to-identify-reason-for-annual-floods-gcci/articleshow/84773383.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Acid attack: ‘We want our daughters safe’||AHMEDABAD: In connection with a case of acid attack, the Gujarat high court on Monday refused bail to an accused and observed, “We want our daughters to be safe.” Justice Paresh Upadhyay rejected the bail plea of a man who has been punished with 10 years in jail. He was convicted for throwing acid on a 19-year-old girl, who had resisted his advances. The judge was not moved by the argument that the convict has already spent six years behind bars. The judge questioned how can it be “that we don’t allow our daughters to walk safely on road?” The court was told that the alleged incident had taken place at 2.30am and acid was thrown from a window on the girl while she was sleeping in her house. After hearing this, Justice Upadhyay said, “We want our daughters to be safe…this is a case where the sentence need not be suspended.” The judge termed this as a very sensitive issue and questioned, “From where they get an idea of throwing acid?” Before the court rejected the bail plea in the acid attack case, it heard a bail plea of an accused in a case in which a woman had died while making tea after a stove exploded. The convict was sentenced to seven years in jail for abetment to suicide. The judge quipped, “The government has made the gas so cheap that it is used to burn daughters.” The judge further commented that it is a usual story in rural areas of women dying of burns while making tea. “Stove’s use is no more than killing daughters,” he commented further. However, the court granted bail to the accused in this case, but not without questioning whether the matter was of suicide or murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-denies-bail-to-acid-attack-accused-observes-we-want-our-daughters-to-be-safe/articleshow/84773452.cms||---

Pruthviraj Jagtap, a restaurant owner at Mirajkar Tikti, said, “Dine-in facility started from today after a gap of three months, but people are still now aware of it. Thus we got poor response on the first day. In order to abide by the 50% occupancy rule we are allowing people to sit on alternate tables.” Sameer Patel, a customer at a cafe in Tarabai Park area, said, “It was a great feeling to sit with friends and enjoy a sip of coffee after a gap of more than three months.

---||Delhi||Eight new dengue cases take overall tally to 48 this year||NEW DELHI: The city saw eight new dengue cases in the last one week, taking the overall tally this year to 48, stated the vector-borne disease report released by the municipal corporations on Monday. With the monsoon starting in Delhi, there has been a rise in the weekly count of dengue cases. During the corresponding period, 28 dengue cases were reported in 2020 and 34 in 2019. The city had also registered 20 malaria and 11 chikungunya cases this year. Bulk of vector-borne disease cases were reported between July and November, but the period might stretch till mid-December. According to the report, of the 48 dengue cases, 17 were reported from South Delhi Municipal Corporation areas. The domestic breeding checkers had, so far, detected mosquito breeding in 50,273 houses with 22,339 cases from North Delhi Municipal Corporation areas, 17,531 from SDMC and 10,403 from east Delhi. Officials from the public health department said over 45,000 legal notices had been issued to various property owners for mosquitogenic conditions. The analysis of mosquito breeding data from three civic bodies showed that peri-domestic containers, such as money plant, vase, flower pots, bird pots, tin, tyre, and fountain water, accounted for the largest chunk (38%) of mosquito breeding cases. At 33%, domestic water storage containers (drums, buckets, jeri cans), which are usually used in water-stressed regions, came second, while desert coolers and over-head tanks stood third and fourth, respectively. The contribution of each category keeps varying through the year, with domestic water storage containers and desert coolers being the largest contributors in summer, and peri-domestic containers assuming a larger proportion in monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/eight-new-dengue-cases-take-overall-tally-to-48-this-year/articleshow/84773395.cms||---

---||Delhi||Five held after exchange of fire in Chhawla; cops say 11 cases solved||New Delhi: Delhi Police has arrested five men, including a wanted criminal, following a brief exchange of fire during an encounter in Chhawla in the early hours of Monday. Two policemen were shot at by the criminals in a bid to escape. The cops survived the attack because of their bulletproof vests. Two of the five men were shot in their legs as the police teams retaliated, senior officers said. The arrested men have been identified as Ajaj (33), a proclaimed offender since 2017 and wanted in a robbery case, Irshad (35), Ismaile (24), Sajat (53) and Nabiya (55), all of them from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. Two pistols, three knives and a car were recovered from them. Following the arrests, police claimed to have solved at least 11 cases of theft and house break-in reported from different parts of Delhi and Rewari in Haryana. Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said that on January 12, a robbery of buffaloes from main Najafgarh Chhawla Road was reported. “Early morning on Monday, information was received that five criminals, possessing illegal weapons and previously involved in similar cases, would come on Goyla Dairy-Dwarka Road in their Bolero pickup around 5 am. Our teams swung into action and the road near Samta Enclave, Goyla Dairy Road was barricaded. After the tempo was spotted, it was signalled to stop at the checkpoint, but the tempo driver rammed the barricade trying to escape,” Meena said. The police team then started chasing the suspects. Seeing the cops, the men in the pickup truck started pelting stones on the team. “However, the truck rammed a streetlight pole and came to a halt. Sensing that they were trapped, two of the occupants of the truck jumped out and started firing upon the police team. Two head constables received bullets on their bulletproof jackets. In the retaliatory firing, both these criminals were shot in the legs and both were overpowered while in possession of one country made pistol each. Other three criminals were also overpowered and each was found in possession of a knife,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/five-held-after-exchange-of-fire-in-chhawla-cops-say-11-cases-solved/articleshow/84773435.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Aurangabad||Active cases continue to rise in Beed district||Aurangabad: Beed district in Marathwada has not been witnessing any decline in fresh cases of Covid-19 and the single district is accounting for over half of the total active cases in the region. Marathwada, comprising eight districts, has a total of 2,731 active cases, out of which Beed has the maximum 1,446 cases. The active cases in Beed district were 1,522 on May 15, which is considered a record low in the recent past. Acting Beed district collector Tushar Thombare on Monday said four talukas from the district were showing no decline in Covid cases. “Ashti, Patoda, Shirur and Georai talukas have been reporting considerable number of fresh cases of Covid on a daily basis. By virtue of it, the district as a whole is reporting daily fresh cases in the range of 150 to 200 during the past fortnight. This is in contrast to record low of 108 cases reported during the second week of June,” he said. Thombare said the district administration has imposed stricter curbs in the aforesaid four talukas with commercial establishments allowed to remain open only upto 12.30 pm during Monday to Friday and complete closure on weekends. “The relatively more infected talukas border with southern part of Ahmednagar district and witness public movement between the two districts. It could be one of the reasons behind no decline in Covid cases in these districts. Also, we are engaged in aggressive testing that invariably leads to detection of more cases,” he said. Among other remaining Marathwada districts, Osmanabad has 645 active cases followed by Aurangabad (302), Latur (133), Parbhani (70), Jalna (66), Nanded (48) and Hingoli (21).

---||Hyderabad||‘Litigant parent’: Hyderabad schools embarrass students over fees||HYDERABAD: Schools in Hyderabad seem to be taking some harsh measures with children whose parents did not pay the full fees during the ongoing pandemic. ‘Litigant parent’, ‘dropout’, ‘fee not paid’ are some of the comments being mentioned by some private schools on transfer certificates (TC) of students, whose parents questioned managements for violating fee regulation norms. Many parents told TOI this is practice that will affect future prospects of their kids. Apart from the fact that the remarks will make it difficult for them to get admission in other schools, a TC is an important document that must be presented in different situations. Students may have to face questions and humiliation each time the TC is presented, parents feared. A transfer certificate issued by a school in Hyderbad“How am I a litigant parent? I was among those who asked the school to follow GO No 46 on fees. Now the school has mentioned ‘litigant parent’ on my son’s TC,” said Shaik Sikindar, who took a TC for his son studying in class V from Niraj Public School, Ameerpet. He said that initially he checked for his son’s details and did not see the remark by the school for over a month. “Until another parent called and enquired about the remark, I did not notice it,” he said. Another parent, who took TCs for both her children studying in class IV and VI from the same school, said that she too found ‘litigant parent’ on her children’s TC. “My child studied in the school for last eight years. We never questioned them about anything,” she said. “During the pandemic, because of financial constraints, we approached the school and the management had no respect towards parents. In the end, they rewarded us with this remark,” she said. Jivitesh Reddy B, principal of Niraj school claimed that the remark was mentioned on TCs of only four to five students, whose parents damaged the reputation of the school. “We want to alert the next school about what kind of parents they are going to deal with,” said Reddy. The principal claimed that although the school did not violate any norms, the parents went on to write against the school to education department officials and others. Another school in Bowenpally is said to be mentioning ‘dropout’ or ‘not promoted’ on TCs of fee defaulters. “When I went to apply for TC for my younger daughter, they told me that if I fail to clear dues, they will mention ‘dropout’ on my child’s TC,” said a parent of class III student. He said that though the state has promoted all students and asked schools to not insist on TCs, no rules are implemented on the ground. “One-and-a-half years of my child’s education is wasted. I have no option except to wait until I have required money to clear dues,” the parent added. Many also claimed that their children are given TCs without applying for the document as they participated in the protest against the school. “My son’s school gave him TC claiming that I made a post against the school on social media. I never made any such post. I had put forth my opinion on fee concession on parents group,” said a parent of class 1 student, Glendale International School, Bandlaguda. Minu Salooja, assistant director of the school, however, said that the school did not give TC to any student forcefully. “It’s true that we have sent an advanced intimation saying to opt for another school if parents are unhappy with us, but did not give TCs forcefully,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/litigant-parent-hyd-schools-embarrass-students-over-fees/articleshow/84777408.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Amritsar||In Pakistan, Hindu girl rescued by police, now with parents||AMRITSAR: Pakistani Hindu girl, Reena Meghwar, who was allegedly forcibly married to an elderly Muslim man and converted to Islam was rescued by the local police and handed over to her parents on Monday. Talking to TOI over phone from Karachi, Kheal Das Kohistani, Pakistani Hindu Member National Assembly (MNA), who represents Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), said that after the video of the girl seeking help online went viral on the internet, she was rescued by Badin police. Her statement was recorded in court and she was handed over to her parents. Reena, who hails from Karyo Ghanwar village in Badin district was allegedly forced to marry Mohammad Qasim in February, after which she was converted to Islam and renamed Maryam. A few months ago, a video of Reena alias Maryam, which was recorded by her on a rooftop went viral, wherein she was seen pleading to her neighbours to help her. She was seen requesting them to inform her parents about her condition. “When she was taken by the police to record her statement, she retracted under pressure and was sent back to Qasim’s house,” said Kheal Das, adding that on Sunday, another video of Reena crying for help went viral, following which police swung into action and recovered her from her alleged husband’s house. Member, Pakistan’s National Commission for Minorities (NCM) Dr Jaipal Chhabria said the community was pleased with the quick action taken by the police to help Reena. He added that NCM was scheduled to meet non-Muslim parliamentarians and minister of human rights and senator Shireen Mazari on July 30 to discuss the issue of forced conversions in Pakistan. Meanwhile, Jaipal Chhabria underlined the need for implementation of the Child Marriage Act and restriction of religious conversion age to 18 years. “These are a few measures which could help prevent forced conversions and ensure police action against violators. Besides, we do not accept conversion by moulvis” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/in-pakistan-hindu-girl-rescued-by-police-now-with-parents/articleshow/84777427.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Mumbai||BMC puts on hold Rs 150 crore plan to rebuild old schools||MUMBAI: BMC has put on hold an around Rs 150-crore proposal to repair and reconstruct municipal schools citing lack of funds. These 36 schools are spread across the city and many structures are dilapidated. Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh alleged that BMC had misplaced priorities and was spending money on beautification projects instead of focusing on core civic amenities. TimesViewHow can BMC, India’s richest civic body still sitting on giant-sized fixed deposits despite the costs it has had to incur during Covid, cite shortage of funds as the reason for not repairing civic schools? It should immediately sanction funds for these civic schools. If it can spend a few thousand crores every year on monsoon works that go down the drain anyway, why hold back on education and the crumbling infrastructure that can imperil the lives of children?In its budget this year BMC allocated Rs 2,945.78 crore for education, which was marginally higher than that of the previous year’s Rs 2944.59 crore. “BMC has put administrative approval for these 36 schools on hold, citing lack of funds. The schools are in a very bad shape. Shivaji Nagar municipal school had 3,000 students before Covid-19. The school is collapsing but BMC has kept its reconstruction on hold,” Shaikh said. The schools whose approvals have been put on hold include Malad Marathi School, heritage work at Lord Harris Municipal School in Fort, Kherwadi Municipal School, Goregaon East Pahadi Municipal School and Ban Dongri Municipal School in South Mumbai. BMC officials said proposals and estimates for all the schools were made but the administrative approval was held back as BMC was facing a cash crunch. Officials said there are around 3 lakh students in BMC schools. Earlier this month, a decision to take up Rs 1,200 crore worth of road repairs starting October 2021 was kept pending. Officials had said that as the volume of work was huge, they want to moderate it and decide which needs to be taken up on priority. But Opposition party corporators had alleged that BMC was spending “lavishly” on large projects, while essential road work was ignored. Additional municipal commissioner Ashwini Bhide said she would check up the issue. Joint municipal commissioner Ashutosh Salil said, “I will have to check details of these schools with the education officer and deputy chief engineer, school infrastructure cell.” “Once schools are open, this building will be unsafe for kids. BMC must stop spending on unnecessary beautification but ensure school buildings are reconstructed and repaired. The entire school project was planned and designed but it has suddenly been put on hold,” Shaikh said. In its budget this year, BMC dipped into fixed deposits and withdraw Rs 10,564 crore as loan to meet increasing expenditure. The 2020-21 estimated expenditure was Rs 33,441 crore, which was increased to Rs, 39,039 (17%) for this financial year. Instead of raising money from the market through bonds, the administration took an internal interest-free loan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-puts-on-hold-rs-150cr-plan-to-rebuild-old-schools/articleshow/84777435.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Lucknow||Ambulance staff in Uttar Pradesh worried about future, wages||LUCKNOW: Ambulance service across Uttar Pradesh remained adversely affected due to the ongoing strike by the drivers and support staff over their demands and concerns about the future. Ambulance staff are worried after the entry of a new player in the ambulance services in the state in June 2021. Since 2012, the ambulance services have been provided by the GVK EMRI. In 2017, GVK EMRI was also given the task to run the advanced life support (ALS) ambulance. However in June 2021, the responsibility to run the ALS service was handed over to a new player Ziqitza Gulf Medical Response and Ambulance Services (Ziqitza). Even as the handover from GVK EMRI to Ziqitza is expected to begin anytime, there is confusion among the employees—driver and emergency medical technician—about their status and future. Those working with ALS ambulances fear a large number of job losses as they will become redundant to the old company while the new company is likely to engage new people. Meanwhile, the new company has started its recruitment drive. The ALS employees were also worried about the salary being offered by the new players. Against about Rs 13,000 at GVK EMRI, the new player is offering Rs 10,000 only. They were asking the drivers to submit a demand draft of Rs 20,000 for training of the new employees. The staff has represented their matter to UP NHM, state health and labour departments but to no avail. “We have requested the key stakeholders to address our concern but no one has lent an ear to us in the past month,” said Hanuman Pandey, the president of the ambulance staff association. They have been protesting since July 23. On Monday, staff of the 108 (Emergency Service) and 102 (National Ambulance Service) extended support to the agitating ALS employees. Senior vice-president GVK EMRI TSVK Reddy said: “The fact that patients did suffer is undeniable. But we are not to be blamed for it as we were caught in the crossfire between agitating staff on one side and the government and Ziqitza on the other hand. In fact, patient services were partially resumed on our request and counselling to the association.” Around 3pm the government managed to bring the leaders to the table for dialogue. While the talks were on, the association resumed patient care services partially. But the meetings remained inconclusive.  “Health officials are mounting pressure on us to give up but we have been brought to the brink by their faulty policies.

The first day of reopening saw thin participation with an average of 20% attendance reported across the state, according to state government sources. While some parents are still reluctant of sending their children to school with warnings of a possible third-wave of Covid-19 from experts, heavy rains in many parts of the state also seemed to have been a deterrent. In the case of Class 9, out of 3.72 lakh students enrolled in 12,936 schools, about 86,734 students attended on the first day They represented about 23.26% of the total students in Class 9. For Class 10 students, of 4.04 lakh, 98,000 or about 24.25% attended on the first day. Similarly, for Class 9 students, 14.35% or about 43,000 out of total 3 lakh, attended classroom studies on Monday. Manan Chowksi, managing trustee of Udgam School for Children said that the school saw 40% attendance. He said that transportation is a major issue with many parents and their children. Once this is sorted out, the attendance in schools will increase, he added. In Ahmedabad, 20% Class 9 students attended school on Monday while for Class 10 students 21% attended. In the case of Class 9 students, the attendance was only 11% in 324 schools in Ahmedabad. Mrugen Shah, principal of Prakash High School said that they are yet to reopen their school for in-person classroom studies as parents are happy with online teaching and are not willing to switch to ‘offline’ studies immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/attendance-thin-as-schools-open-for-classes-9-to-11/articleshow/84773572.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Agriculture loss in deluge-hit Sattari taluka pegged at Rs 40 lakh||VALPOI: The recent heavy rainfall and subsequent floods have caused major damage to crops and plantations in Sattari taluka. Farmers said that their crops have been destroyed in the deluge that washed away banana plantations, arecanut, cashew, coconut and other trees. The zonal agricultural office of Sattari has estimated a loss of around Rs 40 lakh in the taluka, with Velus, Sonal, Khotode, Uste, Keri, Sanvordem, Bhironda, Advoi, Mauxi, Padeli, Massordem and Guleli villages being the most affected. In Sattari, most of the villagers are involved in agriculture and sustain on this income. Farmers are hoping for adequate compensation from the government as soon as possible. Devendra Gaonkar, a resident of Velus, said that their banana and arecanut plantations were completely destroyed. “Our hard work to grow the plants went in vain,” he said, and urged the government to provide maximum compensation to the affected farmers. Zonal agricultural officer of Sattari Vishwanath Gawas told TOI that plantations in low-lying areas along the river banks in Sattari have been damaged due to inundation. He said that farmers had recently used fertilizers for their crops, and due to the floods, the fertile soil has now been washed away. Gawas said that agriculture department officials have visited most of the flood-affected areas in the taluka to survey the destroyed plantations. “Farmers have started submitting their applications to our office to claim compensation, and till now we have received around 50 applications,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/agriculture-loss-in-deluge-hit-sattari-taluka-pegged-at-rs-40l/articleshow/84773443.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Few takers for online vaccine slots at government & private centres, walk-ins rise||NAGPUR: With repeated breaks in vaccination programme at government centres, it seems citizens are now mostly preferring offline registration for inoculation. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has restricted the online session to only one slot of two hours from 11am to 1pm, which too is not finding many takers. Compared to this, private vaccination centres have multiple online sessions of 100-200 doses from 9am to 9pm. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the single online slot has been kept to ensure vaccination is not delayed for those waiting in queue. “Walk-in beneficiaries queue up since morning at centres. We apprehended that people may object over someone coming late and getting jabbed before them if say a slot of 5pm was opened. To avoid such confusion among beneficiaries, we decided to keep only one slot,” he said. Joshi added that in case a beneficiary doesn’t turn up, it is cancelled and that person has to go for offline registration. “Less number of people are booking online slots,” he said. Some NMC health officials said majority of the ‘tech-savvy population’ is covered. But, citizens feel they were under constant impression that vaccines are over and therefore, no slot were available. NMC officials claimed that citizens can walk-in at any centre till 6pm to get vaccinated on days it has enough stock. However, they agreed that some centre staff would send back people to save vaccines for the next day. When vaccines are not available, the staff has to do some other work due to which they resorted to saving stock. TOI spoke to a couple of private centres where too they have observed a drop in online bookings. Amit Somani, director of Kingsway Hospital, said in the last one week, walk-in vaccinations have increased as compared to online booking. “We have about 81 % walk-in versus 19% through online booking,” he said. OCHRI director Dr Anup Marar said, “We do observe online bookings of over 150 on an average daily, but turnout from this registered list is around 60% only due to unknown reasons even though we are open on Sundays too. Hence, we do take walk-ins and help the incoming eligible beneficiaries register.” Dr Rajesh Swarnakar, chief pulmonologist and director of Getwell Hospital, too said though often people don’t turn up despite making an online booking, they don’t deny the jab. “We make all efforts to ensure they are jabbed on their visit even if their online booking has expired. They give us excuses like fever, headache or any emergency work for not showing up,” he said. Dr Tushar Gawad, director (administration), Alexis Multispecialty Hospital, said they have more online registrations. “We are doing limited number of vaccinations per day to ensure good experience. We are also starting vaccination with Covishield at our hospital.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/few-takers-for-online-vax-slots-at-govt-pvt-centres-walk-ins-rise/articleshow/84773459.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Hyderabad||First-timers anxious as vax supplies to Telangana dry up||HYDERABAD: Health authorities in Telangana on Monday said they were forced to suspend the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine after supplies from the Centre dried up a few days ago. Sensing a shortfall, authorities were directed to administer only the second dose last week and first-timers were asked to wait. The state has 80 lakh beneficiaries who are yet to get their first jabs at a time when pandemic experts have stressed that vaccine is the only weapon against the virus along with Covid-appropriate behaviour. “The only weapon we have currently is the vaccine, even if there is no spike in cases in any area, taking the vaccine is important to prevent serious illness and hospitalisation,” said professor Shashank Tripathi, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. People are being asked to check availability of vaccine doses before venturing into any centre for the first dose. On Monday, a meagre 20,000 jabs were given in Hyderabad and 1.47 lakh doses across the state, mirroring the poor situation. Across Hyderabad, many looking for the first dose came back home dejected. “I went to the vaccination centre at Amberpet, but I could not get the dose,” said SK Vali, a 45-year-old private employee, who was hoping to get his first dose. In a few centres of the city, second dose of Covaxin was also not available the past few days. “But we are giving first and second doses to students, who are going abroad for education” a top official said. With the Urban Primary Health Care Centres (UPHCs) administering only second doses in the past few days, guidelines on vaccine drive has come to a halt. Some experts said preference of people to visit government vaccine centres over private centres is also leading to more shortage. The turnout in private hospitals has come down by 80 percent when compared to the days when the state government opened the free drive for all age groups. “There is practically no rush in the private centres, those who can afford the cost but want to be vaccinated immediately visit private vaccine centres,” the manager of a top private hospital told TOI. Experts suggest it is better to take at least one dose of vaccine wherever it is available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/first-timers-anxious-as-vax-supplies-to-t-dry-up/articleshow/84777443.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

He also called for modernisation of the disaster management system. Naik inspected the flood-hit Pale village in Bicholim taluka on Monday. Stating that the recent flooding has other causes besides nature, Naik said that in order to rectify this, it is necessary to modernise disaster management by undertaking activities like sludge dredging. “There is a need for an in-depth study of the cause of natural calamities. Rivers and streams which are filled with sludge need to be cleaned. Without this, there will be no space for drainage of rainwater,” he said. Further, he said that a report will be prepared within the next two days and submitted to the Union government, seeking immediate relief for victims of the flooding.” We will try our level best to provide maximum compensation and help those affected,” he said. Later in the day, Naik, accompanied by health minister and Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane, also visited the flood-affected areas in Sattari. He interacted with the people whose houses have collapsed, heard their grievances and assured them of all possible help. “We conducted a meeting at Rane’s office, along with North Goa collector Ajit Roy, Sattari deputy collector Rajesh Ajgaonkar, mamlatdar Dasharath Gawas, the block development officer and PWD officials, and instructed them to provided maximum help to the victims,” Naik told reporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shripad-for-study-on-floods-disaster-mgmt-overhaul/articleshow/84773455.cms||---
---||India||Rahul Gandhi rides tractor to Parliament, seeks scrapping of farm laws||NEW DELHI: Taking all by surprise and sending police into a tizzy, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday morning drove a tractor to the Parliament gate as part of the protest against the controversial farm laws, and demanded that the legislations be withdrawn. BJP dubbed it as “photo-op” and “theatrics” meant to derail the functioning of the two Houses. In the high security area where heavy vehicles are closely monitored, Rahul executed a plan that was kept under the wraps till the last moment. As per CCTV footage, it was brought surreptitiously overnight from Haryana in a canter to avoid detection by police. Investigations have also begun to ascertain how the tractor reached the Lutyens’ Zone. Taking the wheel of the tractor parked at the residence of senior lawyer and Rajya Sabha MP KTS Tulsi on Moti Lal Nehru Marg, Rahul sped away along the road leading to Parliament, before the cops realised what had happened. Riding along were party MPs from Punjab Ravneet Bittu, Amar Singh, Partap Singh Bajwa, Gurjeet Aujla, and Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda. Later, AICC spokesman Randeep Surjewala, youth Congress president BV Srinivas, Pranav Jha among others, who followed Rahul’s tractor in a convoy, were detained by the police and taken to Mandir Marg police station from where they were released after seven hours. Rahul told reporters that the government was oppressing the farmers and the three farm laws were designed to benefit select corporate houses. “This (tractor) is a message from the farmers. The government will have to withdraw these three laws,” he said. BJP said instead of “dramatics and theatrics”, the Congress functionary should use Parliament for constructive debate. “People of Congress themselves make fun of Rahul Gandhi's statements. He has no experience of the pain of the village, poor, or farmers. He is habituated to lie day after day in his unsuccessful attempt to stay politically relevant,” said Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar. BJP chief spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Anil Baluni said Rahul’s sole agenda is to disrupt Parliament. “The government has consistently maintained that it is ready for debate on any issue. Instead of theatrics, Rahul Gandhi should have led his party in Parliament to raise issues on which they have reservations. However, the Congress leader doesn’t want a constructive, healthy debate to take place,” Baluni said adding that the Congress leader was making a mockery of parliamentary democracy as he should have been active in Parliament rather than doing a ‘photo-op’. Meanwhile, as Parliament continued to be paralysed, senior MP Jairam Ramesh said, “The entire Opposition is united. Have a discussion on Pegasus snooping issue in the presence of Prime Minister or Home Minister and announce a Supreme Court-monitored enquiry into the scandal. Parliament is not functioning because the government is not agreeing to these legitimate demands.” Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said the government was spying on the heads of its own security force and intelligence agency which was unacceptable, besides snooping on journalists and opposition leaders. He said the party’s demand for judicial probe and discussion was being stonewalled which was leading to drama in Parliament.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rahul-gandhi-rides-tractor-to-parliament-seeks-scrapping-of-farm-laws/articleshow/84778637.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Day after split, both factions of INL claim majority support||Kozhikode: A day after the split in Indian National League (INL), the factions headed by state president and general secretary are busy with claims and manoeuvrings to show they represent the official group. Both leaders said that they will soon meet top CPM and LDF leaders to apprise them of the developments and will stake a claim that they represent the official wing of the party. Though CPM has taken a wait-and-watch approach now, it will have to eventually take a side, especially since divisions in the party seems irreversible and as minister Ahmed Devarkovil as well as the national leadership of the party is with the faction led by INL state general secretary Kasim Irikkur. The faction led by INL state president AP Abdul Wahab has convened a meeting of the party’s state council in Kozhikode on Aug 3 which the faction intends to make a show of strength. Wahab said on Monday that 90% of the cadres were with him. He also questioned the credentials of the party’s national president to take action against him. “As per the party’s constitution, the national president can take action against the state president. But for the current national president to confirm with the norms laid down by the party constitution, he has to get elected again. According to the norms, the president has to be elected by members of the national council and currently there is no national council in force in the party. Let the national president clarify with whom he is aligned with outside the state,” Wahab added. INL state general secretary Kasim Irikkur, who claims to have the support of the national leadership and ports minister Ahmed Devarkovil, said that there was no split in the party and that leaders from 13 of the 14 district committees along with 12 of the 20 secretariat members and office-bearers of affiliate organizations had attended the state working committee meet in Kochi on Sunday. Meanwhile, INL national president Mohammad Suleman justified the expulsion of party state president saying that the untoward incidents at state secretariat meeting was shocking. “The state president was removed from the party on the report given by state committee meeting,” Suleman said, adding that the party will not compromise on the matter of discipline and that no one is above the party. It is learnt that some of the leaders who had faced action are trying to revive National Secular Congress which had merged with INL in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/day-after-split-both-factions-of-inl-claim-majority-support/articleshow/84773570.cms||---
---||Delhi||Birds and the bees for real at this govt school in southwest Delhi; wait, there is a treehouse too||NEW DELHI: The clucking of a hen, quacking of ducks and chirping of budgerigars are unfamiliar sounds in the city environment. But for one government school in the lanes of Ambedkar Nagar in south-west Delhi, these are the unlikely ambient sounds. Along with birds, fish and animals and a water fountain, the school now has a new addition — a treehouse atop an old peepal tree. The Government Girls’ Senior Secondary School, Sector 4, Ambedkar Nagar, has completely changed in the last two years, the transformation coming after Aruna Anand took over as principal. Shabnam Khokar, an arts teacher at the school since 1997, testified, “Madam is the one who encouraged us to make the school colourful and lively. We are now waiting for the children to come back so that they can also learn.” The children, of course, aren’t there to enjoy these because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But parents visiting the school for the parents-teachers meeting are unable to resist the temptation of clicking a selfie at the water fountain. Anand, who was promoted from a senior teacher to principalship, told TOI, “I always believe in doing things differently. I wanted to make this school more interesting and there can be no better theme than being close to nature. We already have a butterfly park and we will also have bee rearing, which will be taught to us by officials from Pusa Institute.” Every patch of land in the institution has been used for the project. One section has turned into a park with the birds and rabbits, another for the bees and butterflies. There’s a maize plot and a small fish pond with lotus. Besides basil, lemongrass and guava, the school also has a mulberry tree and all are labelled so the students can learn their names. A discarded vegetable cart has been transformed into a table and car tyres are chairs, symbolic of the effort at sustainability. “I thought adding a treehouse would be nice. It took about three months to build. It is sturdy and can hold 15 adults. I am sure the children will love it,” said Anand. Seeing the school seeking to influence the people, the community has donated a 200-year-old cart to the institution. “The cart was used by the Banjara, or forest wanderers. These tribals from Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh collected wood and food grains and used these carts to transport them,” said Anand. The principal has also bought a bioscope so children can learn how people in the past entertained themselves. “After a long search, I finally got in Chandni Chowk,” smiled Anand, who also innovatively piqued curiosity among students by putting up a letter box in place of the regular suggestions box.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/birds-and-the-bees-for-real-at-this-govt-school-in-southwest-delhi-wait-there-is-a-treehouse-too/articleshow/84773531.cms||Shradha Chettri

The grant was made by Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board on directions from deputy CM and labour minister Manish Sisodia, Delhi government said in a statement. “When the first lockdown was imposed last year, Delhi government was one of the first to grant relief disbursement to all the 39,600 workers, who were registered with the construction board in March 2020,” Sisodia said He added that inspections and mass registration drives had been conducted and a series of reforms brought in the department. “As a result of this, within 8 months, the number of construction workers registered with the board has increased to 3 lakh,” he said. Delhi government had already disbursed Rs 5,000 each to 2,16,602 construction workers as Covid-relief disbursement in April this year. The ex gratia payment is for construction workers whose applications were approved between May 28 and July 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-grants-rs-5k-relief-to-nearly-48k-workers/articleshow/84773539.cms||---

Gadling had challenged a Se-ptember 2020 rejection of the NIA court and the agency said much time has passed and the trial court’s order cannot be disturbed now. The NIA also cited the charges to argue he faces a se-rious case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Gadling had sought interim bail last year and his counsel Indira Jaising said he may be granted a three-week interim release on bail to perform the rituals as he was granted no relief last year when his mother passed away. The NIA, represented by additional solicitor general Anil Singh and advocate Sandesh Patil, had submitted a short reply to oppose his plea. On Monday, Patil said the grounds for rejection in the trial court order were that the allegations were under the UAPA, and hence serious in nature. The NIA on Monday said as it has been almost 10 months since the order, Gadling has “sought to introduce a new reason for temporary bail” by saying the family wants to conduct the funeral rites. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bombay-hc-reserves-order-on-interim-bail-plea-of-gadling/articleshow/84777490.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Remdesivir sale: HC raps Gujarat govt for invoking PASA||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Monday rapped the state government for threatening people by invoking PASA in connection with sale of remdesivir injections during the second wave of Covid-19 and said that it creates anarchy. The court reiterated its question as to why the government invokes the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities (PASA) Act in a case of sale of one or two remdesivir injections, when a political party gets a clean chit over distribution of 5,000 injections. “Don’t threaten people. This is creating an anarchy among people. The second wave (of Covid-19) was not in our hand. It happened. But is this the way to handle the situation created by it? Where will the people go?” Justice Paresh Upadhyay asked the government, when a doctor from Vadodara filed a petition seeking protection fearing detention under PASA. He was booked for sale of one remdesivir injection to a Covid-19 patient in unauthorised manner. One of the accused in this case has already been detained under PASA. The case involved Dr Mitesh Thakkar, who was booked on the statement of a co-accused, an Ayurveda practitioner. He moved the HC apprehending detention under PASA after a co-accused was detained in PASA, and after he was granted bail by the high court. The high court has stayed any action against the doctor until the state government files its reply by July 31 and gives justification for invocation of PASA, or initiating a proposal for the same by the police authority. Last week, Justice Upadhyay had questioned the government on booking people for sale of remdesivir and for not acting in the case involving a political party distributing 5,000 injections. On hearing Dr Thakkar’s case, he asked, “Do you want to invoke PASA even after the query (by the court) last time? If you are doing this qua one or two injections, I have to question about those 5,000 injections. I am reiterating… If a political party donates 5,000 injections in good faith, then is everything in accordance with law? And when there is an issue of one or two injections involving a doctor, you invoke PASA?” The judge told the prosecutor that this is a serious issue. “You deal with the case of blackmarketing in ironhanded manner. But when there is an anarchy and everybody is afraid, people are trying to manage injections from anywhere. You want to invoke PASA? I am on Article 14. Isn’t it applicable in other case?” the court said about the distribution of injections from Surat BJP office in April. The judge asked the government not to create panic among people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/remdesivir-sale-hc-raps-state-govt-for-invoking-pasa/articleshow/84773523.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Sikh bodies to join hands for holy book’s honour: Akal Takht jathedar||Amritsar: Sikh religious leadership’s gathering held under the aegis of Akal Takht on Monday decided to initiate a joint move to not only bring an end to the incidents of sacrilege, but ensure that perpetrators of desecration of saroop of Guru Granth Sahib are given exemplary punishment. At the same time, Sikh religious leaders appealed to all not to play politics on a sensitive issue. Talking to media, Akal Takht officiating jathedar Harpreet Singh said a resolution had been adopted wherein it was decided to commence a joint move by Sikh religious leadership along with Sikh intellectuals and thinkers to intensify the propagation of Sikhism across the state and bring awareness about Sikh rehat maryada (Sikh code of religious conduct) and have zero tolerance over the incidents of sacrilege. He said their initiative would also help check incidents of conversions in Punjab. At the same time, the officiating jathedar cautioned the people to not play politics on the issue of sacrilege. He said the gathering also recorded the statement of former head of special investigation team (SIT), Ranbir Singh Khatra, who was investigating the incidents of sacrilege to know the exact turnout of events. “We will release his recording soon,” he said. Reacting to the meeting, Amrik Singh Ajnala, president of Damdami Taksal, Ajnala, a breakaway faction of Mehta Chowk-based Sikh seminary Damdami Taksal, alleged: “We oppose this meeting tooth and nail since it is not aimed at finding a solution to the incidents of sacrilege or put the perpetrators behind bars, but the meeting aims to generate sympathy of SAD in the wake of ensuing 2022 assembly elections and improve the image of SGPC.” Ajnala wondered why the SAD leadership didn’t visit the gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala, Faridkot, from where the saroop of Guru Granth Sahib was stolen on June 1, 2015. “Politics is being played in the guise of religious deliberations and we will create awareness among people against these machinations,” he said. The former jathedar of Takht Damdama Sahib, Kewal Singh, questioned why the SGPC and other Sikh religious leader had gone out of way to pardon Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim. He also sought the answer of the alleged role of SAD behind the dera chief’s pardon. Box: Panel to check violation at U’khand shrine Taking note of the violation of maryada (code of conduct) during the arrival of Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami at Gurdwara Sri Nanakmata Sahib in Uttarakhand, Akal Takht officiating jathedar Harpreet Singh said he had formed a three-member committee that would visit the site and submit its report following which legal action would be taken. Reacting to the incident, SGPC president Jagir Kaur said SGPC would write a letter to the management committee of Gurdwara Nanakmata Sahib seeking clarification on the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/sikh-bodies-to-join-hands-for-holy-books-honour-akal-takht-jathedar/articleshow/84777504.cms||---

When family members could not get an ambulance even after repeatedly dialling 108 service, they hired a private taxi for hospital. “Doctors diagnosed a stroke and said a delay of a few more minutes would have been fatal,” Vishuna’s son Shubham told TOI. “Every time we dialled 108 ambulance service, the staff told us to wait. They should have refused on the first call itself,” he added. Like Vishuna, many patients in need of an ambulance were left in the lurch on Monday due to the work boycott by a section of 108 and 102 ambulance employees. The boycott call was given by the employees’ association to protest the delay in acceptance of their demands. While the association claimed that the strike was 100% successful, officers of the private agency that runs the service said only a section of employees boycotted work. “On an average, these two ambulance services (102 and 108) ferry 1,000 patients daily. However, around 450 patients could get the service till 7pm on Monday,” said an officer. In Lucknow, there are 78 ambulances — 44 under 108 and 34 associated with 102. There was an announcement in the evening that the strike had been called off but president of the association Hanuman Pandey said the employees would continue to boycott work till their demands were met. TSVK Reddy, regional head of the service provider UP GVK Emeri said: “Representatives of employees’ association had assured that they will call off the strike after talks in the presence of additional chief secretary. The state government should take action in case they go back of their promise.” The agitating employees have been demanding regularisation of services under National Health Mission, increase in wages, overtime incentive and Rs 50 lakh insurance claim for the family of colleagues who died of Covid-19. They also demand that if the service provider agency is changed by the government, they should be accommodated in the new company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/patients-bear-the-brunt-as-ambulance-staff-stop-work/articleshow/84775844.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Consumers from the Khadapabandh area in Ponda as well as Carambolim, Old Goa, Azossim, Mandur, Neura, Marcela, Khandola, Cumbharjua, Akhada, Juve and Betqui have been awaiting supply after Friday’s floods affected pumping operations at Opa-Khandepar. A Tamsuli resident said, “When we learnt that Ponda will get water on Monday, we tried to store water as much as possible. There are no natural resources nearby. We are only dependent on tap water. If we don't get water soon, we are planning to go to our relative's place.” Another resident from Sainagar, Marcela said,”Our flat has a big tank. So there was no problem till Monday morning. On Sunday evening, I got to know water will be restored by late night. But this didn't happen. Now we are planning to buy tanker water.” Nivruti Parsekar, PWD executive engineer who overseas supply to Tiswadi and Ponda talukas, said that since water flows quicker towards sumps of buildings midway, consumers staying at higher altitude areas could face problems. Opa water works complex was shut on Friday evening after rain water level in the river rose above the pumping station, inundating pumps and the 33KVA power sub-station that electrifies the plants. After initial repairs, water was released to Panaji, Taleigao, St Andre and St Cruz constituencies on Saturday night. However, Cumbharjua constituency and some areas like Azossim, Mandur could not receive water on Saturday. Water to these areas, including Ponda taluka, was released on Sunday night.

The flouting of norms was found to be more rampant during weekends when stricter curbs are in place. Some establishments, including hotels and restaurants, which fall in the non-essential services category, were also found working on weekends at some places. Pramod Jadhav, in-charge of local civic body-managed squad, admitted that around 30% of the commercial establishments were violating the norms. “We have limited personnel, only 100 employees, and cannot reach out to different areas of the city. We expect the city police to also take action against errant establishments,” he said. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan could not be reached for his comments. When contacted, Ajay Shah, one of the leaders of local traders’ body, said some commercial establishments were proving habitual offenders when it comes to showing compliance to Covid-related curbs. “We are not defending such errant establishments and the authorities are free to take action against them.” he said. Aurangabad district on Monday reported four cases within the municipal limits and another 24 cases in rural areas. While the fresh Covid cases are fewer as compared to the recent past, authorities have appealed to the people at large to follow Covid norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/weekend-curbs-flouted-in-aurangabad/articleshow/84768260.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Admissions controversy: Delhi Public School East officials summoned||AHMEDABAD: The district education officer (DEO) and the district primary education officer (DPEO) on Monday summoned the officials of Delhi Public School (DPS) East, Hirapur, to respond to the complaint of offering admissions illegally. The education department had ordered the closure of the school recently after receiving information that it was admitting students for the academic year 2021-22 without the necessary approvals. A hearing took place at the DEO’s office on Monday at which the school authorities presented a five-page response. “We will take further action after studying the response given by the school management,” said a source in the DEO’s office. A team of officials from the DEO’s office had visited the school to investigate the matter and ordered its immediate shutdown as the school did not have the no-objection certificate (NOC) from the state education department, said sources. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to which the school was seeking affiliation had set March 31 as the deadline to produce the NoC. Close to 380 students had enrolled in DPS East. Last month, the school authorities had sought the nod from the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) for admitting students of secondary and higher secondary classes from June 21. But their application for affiliation and recognition to start a non-grant-in-aid school from June 2021 was rejected. The operations of DPS East were taken over by the Gujarat government in December 2019 after the school landed in a controversy in connection with an ashram run by the self-styled godman Nithyananda. The ashram was located on the school premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/admissions-controversy-dps-east-officials-summoned/articleshow/84773567.cms||---
---||India||Govt ad spend declining over past 3 years||NEW DELHI: The government’s expenditure on advertisements in print, electronic and digital media has steadily declined over the past three years, Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur told the Rajya Sabha on Monday. In a written response to a poser by BJD MP Sasmit Patra, Thakur said the Centre spent Rs 429.55 crore on print ads and Rs 514.29 crore on TV ads in 2018-19. In 2019-20, the allocation for print ads fell to Rs 295.05 crore, while ad expenditure on electronic media platforms was slashed to Rs 316.99 crore. The cut in 2020-21, however, was the sharpest. Government expenditure on advertisements fell to Rs 197.49 crore for print and Rs 167.98 crore for electronic platforms. All these expenditures refer to expenses incurred by the Bureau of Outreach and Communications. The cuts on government spending comes on the heels of a disclosure made by the government in response to a Right to Information query that said that the Centre owes more than Rs 147 crore to various print media outlets, and Rs 67 crore to electronic media, as payment for government advertisements, bills that have been pending since as far back as 2004. The disclosures buttress multiple pleas forwarded by the Indian Newspaper Society in the past years, in which the compendium of print media organisations sought financial assistance from the Centre, while emphasising the fiscal troubles faced by the industry in the wake of the Covid-19 onslaught. INS has pegged the print industry’s losses in December 2020 at around Rs 12,500 crore, and said the annual loss were likely to be around Rs 16,000 crore. It had also demanded a 50% increase in government advertisement rates and a 200% increase in the Centre’s spend on print media advertising and an immediate settlement of advertisement bills outstanding to both central and state governments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-ad-spend-declining-over-past-3-years/articleshow/84778544.cms||---

While ordering the man not to contact his daughter, the bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice B N Karia said that the teen can take her own decision on whether to contact her father and maintain relations only after she turns 18 years of age. According to litigant’s advocate Abhisst Thaker, the couple involved in the case had separated in 2015 with mutual consent and the woman retained custody of the girl, while the father was granted visitation rights. He was also allowed to talk to her and to take her to Canada during her vacations. After the divorce, the woman remarried a businessman and settled in north Gujarat. The girl also lives with the family of her stepfather, who has got two kids from his earlier marriage. The father did not contact the child for few years. He tried to re-connect with the daughter and for enforcing his visitation rights, but the family court rejected his plea. The application was rejected because the teen’s mother submitted that the child got disturbed after her talk with the biological father. The man approached the HC and the judges talked to the child on a few occasions. The judges asked a psychologist to hold counselling sessions and called for a report. The report was submitted to the court in a sealed cover. Upon perusal of the report, the judges said that the child is living happily with the family. They said that they do not think it proper to disturb her equilibrium or peace of mind and stopped the arrangement of visitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-stops-talk-between-teen-and-her-father-in-canada/articleshow/84773580.cms||---

During the second wave, there was a dearth of ICU and oxygen beds in rural Covid facilities and a large number of Covid patients faced problems in getting beds in Nashik city hospitals (government as well as private). District civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat said 250 ICU beds would be added to the rural hospitals at Kalwan, Chandwad, Malegaon sub-civil hospital and the Nashik civil hospital. This will take the ICU bed count from the current 150 to 400. The state government has projected that the Nashik district could see 1.5 times more active cases during the peak, and more than 13,900 people could need hospitalisation in government facilities alone. The task has to be shared by the state health department through the civil hospital and the two municipal corporations in Nashik and Malegaon. The Civil hospital has to prepare the infrastructure for 40% of the required facilities. The number of ventilators required in the district is about 566. “We have at least 275 ventilators and they will be installed at the four ICUs and at the Civil hospital. That will take care of the patients from the rural areas,” Dr Thorat added. The administration has also decided to convert all the beds in the 24 DCHC into oxygen beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rural-nashik-to-get-more-oxygen-and-icu-beds/articleshow/84768299.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Ahmedabad||AM/NS approaches high court over Surat district court order||AHMEDABAD: ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India Ltd (AM/NS) on Monday approached the Gujarat high court against a Surat court’s order rejecting its request to transfer proceedings over dispute arising out of Cargo Handling Agreement (CHA) and non-payment with Essar Bulk Terminal Ltd (EBTL) to an arbitration tribunal constituted by the high court. The dispute arose with regard to an agreement that took place in February 2011. The company initiated arbitration proceedings including issuance of notice in 2020. It approached a court in Surat. While the case was pending in Surat court, both the companies agreed for an arbitration tribunal in July 2021. On July 17, a commercial court in Surat rejected AM/NS’s application to shift the proceedings to the tribunal, which the HC constituted on July 9. The court dismissed the application. It termed the application misconceived. The application for transfer of the proceedings to the tribunal was objected by EBTL and it insisted that the court should pronounce its verdict, though the tribunal consisting three retired Supreme Court judges was formed with mutual understanding. While rejecting AM/NS’s application, the Surat court deferred its judgment for 10 days saying that an issue of interpretation of law was involved in the case and the parties can appeal in a higher forum. The bench of Justice R M Chhaya and Justice Nirzar Desai heard the issue for some time and posted further hearing on August 2 saying that there is a substantial question of law involved in the case and it requires an elaborate hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/am/ns-approaches-high-court-over-surat-district-court-order/articleshow/84773608.cms||---

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Sanjeev Khanna said that CBI should not just proceed only on the basis of report filed by court-appointed Justice D K Jain committee and it had to proceed as per the procedure. Former Kerala police chief Sibi Mathew, who has been named in the FIR along with other 16 people, pleaded the court that the CBI should provide all relevant documents including FIR in trial court so that he could pursue his remedy. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the agency, assured the court that the FIR would be uploaded during the course of the day. "CBI can proceed after registration of FIR... as per law and no directions required from this court. The respondent can take all possible remedies available in law... After registration of FIR, CBI must collect material on its own and not proceed on basis of report submitted by Jain committee which cannot be the sole basis for CBI to pursue the case," the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-asks-cbi-to-move-against-those-accused-in-framing-isro-scientist-in-1994-espionage-case/articleshow/84778667.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Assembly polls 2022: BJP to strengthen its tribal base||GANDHINAGAR: The state government and the state unit of the ruling party have planned a yearlong sustained drive to dent the Congress’s tribal vote bank with the proposed Rs 1 lakh crore Van Bandhu KalyanYojana-II, which the saffron party will kick off from August 9 – World Tribal Day. At stake are the 27 assembly seats which are reserved for candidates from scheduled tribes. In the 2017 assembly election, the Congress won 15, while the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) won 2 seats. The BJP won 9 and one was bagged by an independent. However, the arithmetic has changed considerably since then. MLAs of Dang and Kaprada quit the Congress and joined the BJP, subsequently getting elected on BJP tickets. BJP also won the Morwa Hadaf seat in byelection. Now,the BJP has control over 12 seats reserved for tribals, the Congress has 13 and two are with the BTP. All four Lok Sabha seats reserved for scheduled tribes are held by the BJP. The Gujarat government had launched Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojana in 2007 while Prime Minister Narendra Modi was Gujarat chief minister. Now, after 14 years, the Gujarat government led by chief minister Vijay Rupani has planned to launch the Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojna - II under which BJP plans a massive campaign to woo tribal voters and win maximum seats. Ganpatsinh Vasava, tribal and forest minister said, “The Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana introduced by PM Narendrabhai Modi in 2007, while he was the Gujarat CM, has yield good results. Now the state government has planned to launch the second phase of Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojana from the World Tribal Day on August 9.” “Since 2007, the state government has spent Rs 96,000 crore for development of tribal areas under the Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojna. Under the second phase of the scheme, the state government will spend Rs 1 lakh crore for development of the tribal population. Major focus will be given on health, education, irrigation and infrastructure development in the tribal areas,’’ he added. Ashwin Kotwal, tribal MLA of the Congress and chief whip of the opposition party in the assembly, said, “The BJP has planned to come out with new name of Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojna – II just to mislead tribals before 2022 assembly elections. If BJP’s claim of spending Rs 96,000 crore for tribal development is true, then why are a majority of the tribals still living under poverty line? Why are tribal areas still lacking basic health and education facilities?” Kotwal alleged, “BJP is diverting mandatory tribal sub-plan money for so called roads, irrigation and other construction work only. The government has spent very little for the direct welfare of the tribal population .’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/assembly-polls-2022-bjp-to-strengthen-its-tribal-base/articleshow/84773632.cms||Kapil Dave

The rising waters of the Sharda and Ghagra, the two main rivers in this part of the terai region, have inundated hundreds of acres of agricultural fields and completely washed away cropped land in some parts of the district. In Nighasan tehsil, the Sharda has engulfed 40 houses in a span of 48 hours. The affected people have been shifted to flood relief camps. Similarly, Dhaurahra tehsil is reeling under the wrath of the Sharda and Ghaghra rivers. Large tracts of cultivated land have been washed away at Milik, Laukahi Mallapur and Raini villages. Om Prakash Singh, sub divisional magistrate of Nighasan who visited the affected villages, told TOI, “After initial survey, we have sanctioned compensation for eight families who have lost their pucca houses and four whose thatched huts were destroyed in Grunt no-12 village on Sunday. We will continue the survey and gather information about the affected families. I am personally visiting the affected areas to ensure that relief reaches every affected person. Ration kits along with tarpaulin and kerosene have been distributed to the affected families. Veterinarians have been deployed to take care of the cattle in the flood outposts.” He added that the situation is under control in Ran Nagar, Deep Nagar and other villages in Tikunia area, which are virtually marooned by the swollen Mohana river and its tributaries. “Flood relief camps and flood outposts have been set up in the area with all the required facilities. We have motor boats ready for carrying out rescue operations if needed,” SDM Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/rain-fed-rivers-wreak-havoc-in-kheri/articleshow/84764934.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Ludhiana||Alliance tweak: SAD man joins BSP, made incharge of Urmar assembly seat||Jalandhar: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) working committee member Lakhwinder Singh Lakhi on Monday joined alliance partner Bahujan Samaj Party and latter instantly announced him constituency in-charge from Urmar, from where Punjab Congress’s new working president Sangat Singh Gilzian is the MLA. Lakhi is also from the MLA’s village, Gilzian. It was already being felt within BSP and political circles that the party does not have strong presence in Urmar whereas Akali Dal, despite losing the seat in the last three assembly elections, has considerable presence. It is learnt that Lakhi, who also remained member of political affairs committee of SAD, party’s top decision-making body, and a member of Right to Service Commission during the previous SAD-BJP regime, has been taken into BSP after consultation with SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal. Sources in SAD-BSP said there was possibility that a few more SAD leaders would join BSP, especially in seats where the latter is weak. BSP state president Jasbir Singh Garhi and state party affairs in-charge Randhir Singh Beniwal welcomed him to the party fold here on Monday and immediately announced him the constituency in-charge, which means he is perspective candidate from the constituency. Lakhi comes from a traditional Akali family. For around three decades, he has been active in the party. “My father was a member of Shiromani Akali Dal and I also got active in the party in 1992, first in Youth Akali Dal where I remained general secretary and vice president, and later in the main party,” Lakhi told TOI on Monday. He also remained chairman of Tanda market committee and a member of Hoshiarpur zila parishad. Like the Congress MLA, Lakhi comes from Lubana community, which has strong presence in the constituency. Apart from having agriculture land and working as an arhatiya (commission agent), he also owns a multiplex in Tanda. He was an aspirant for the SAD ticket from the constituency, but the seat had gone to BSP quota in the sharing between Akali Dal and BSP. In SAD and BSP circles, there was a whispering for last some days that he would join BSP and was likely to be next candidate. He had joined Manpreet Badal-led People’s Party of Punjab in 2011, but soon re-joined SAD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/alliance-tweak-sad-man-joins-bsp-made-incharge-of-urmar-assembly-seat/articleshow/84777525.cms||IP Singh

---||Pune||Pune: Third Metro digger reaches Mandai, will now excavate towards Budhwar Peth site||PUNE: A tunnel-boring machine (TBM), which started excavation from the Swargate underground Metro station site, has arrived at the Mandai station site and will continue digging a tunnel till the Budhwar Peth station site in Kasba Peth. Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro), which is executing the project in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, said it was working on a plan to proceed with tunnelling work between Budhwar Peth and Mandai stations. As per the earlier plan, three machines were to meet at the Mandai station site, wherefrom they were to be extracted. “We are in the process of rescheduling the remaining excavation work. The machines will now mostly be extracted at the Budhwar Peth station,” Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro, told TOI. Two machines are excavating a tunnel from Civil Court to Budhwar Peth. Of these, one has already reached the Budhwar Peth station site, while the other is expected to get there by next week. A MahaMetro said allowing the third TBM to excavate from Mandai to Budhwar Peth will save time and effort. “The same TBM will also complete excavation of the second tunnel between Swargate and Budhwar Peth as well,” the official said. Two parallel tunnels are being excavated in the underground section, one each for the up and down lines. The excavation of tunnels has been completed in the agriculture college-Civil Court-Budhwar Peth stretch, while tunnelling is underway in the Budhwar Peth to Swargate stretch. Meanwhile, the MahaMetro said that a fourth machine will not be required — as was originally planned — as three TBMs were enough to complete the work in the stipulated timeframe. Earlier, MahaMetro had planned to use four TBMs for the underground tunnelling work. The underground section is part of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC)-Swargate Metro corridor. The metro will run on a viaduct from PCMC to Range Hills, after which it will go underground at agriculture college depot. From there, it will run underground till Swargate. “So far the excavation for the underground stretch has progressed without any hurdles. We expect to complete the remaining work at the earliest. In addition to tunnelling, we have started constructing five underground stations located on the stretch. Mandai is the fifth station, where work started two months ago,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/third-metro-digger-reaches-mandai-will-now-excavate-towards-budhwar-peth-site/articleshow/84773707.cms||Sarang Dastane

All commercial activities came to standstill in the tribal district even as tourists struggled to find shops and restaurants open to get food or eatables. A group of young tribal activists staged a protest and demanded justice for the two youths. The 19-year-olds, Sunil Pawar and Ravi Jadha, both a native of Dang, were found hanging in a room in the police station. They were picked up by the police as suspects in a motorcylce theft case. So far four cops including police inspector Ajitsinh Vala, sub-inspector M B Kokni, head constable Shaktisinh Zala, and constable Ramji Yadav, have been suspended in connection with the case. No offence has been registered against the cops and investigation was being done by the deputy superintendent of police, Navsari, S G Rana. Police have so far registered a case of accidental death with regard to the two deaths. “The investigation in the accidental death case is continuing and there is no time limit for the investigation. No other actions have been taken against the police officers yet,” said Rishikesh Upadhyay, superintendent of police, Navsari. Preliminary investigation revealed that the deceased duo was kept in a separate room and not in lock-up since they were not formally arrested. Meanwhile, police claim that they hanged themselves to the ceiling fan. “It is not allowed to keep any person locked in any other room except lock-up. A magisterial inquiry and a department inquiry are also being conducted against the responsible cops,” added Upadhyay. “The bandh call was given by the tribal community of Dang. We are demanding that the youth and their families get justice. Those responsible should be punished,” said Baburao Choriya, director, Adijati Vikas Board. BJP MLA from Dang Vijay Patel too supported the bandh calling it an issue of tribal. “Entire district observed bandh and almost all commercial activities had remained closed. People want justice. I met the families and assured them of an in-depth investigation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/dang-observes-bandh-over-chikhli-police-station-deaths/articleshow/84770967.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Private schools’ organisation seeks removal of education minister Varsha Gaikwad||AURANGABAD: The Maharashtra English School Trustees Association (MESTA), an organisation of private schools, on Monday announced a state-wide agitation for the removal of school education minister Varsha Gaikwad for her alleged detrimental policies towards the education sector. Accusing Gaikwad of mishandling school-related issues during the pandemic, MESTA said the minister should step down by taking moral responsibility for the unprecedented crisis being faced by the education sector. “Many private schools are facing survival issues due to wrong policies of the state government. The school education minister has given misleading statements in the matter of fees charged by schools, which led to a financial crisis for schools. The minister is to be blamed for current conflicts between schools and parents regarding charging fees during the Covid outbreak,” said MESTA regional president Namdev Dalvi. MESTA has also criticized Gaikwad for reducing reimbursement amount towards admissions done under Right To Education Act 2009. “While the schools have not received dues towards RTE admissions for the last four academic years, Gaikwad further reduced the reimbursement amount by half. Such a policy decision has further compounded financial issues faced by schools,” it has said. Dalvi listed out recent incidents of online portals for SSC results and thereafter Class XI admissions remaining down for a considerable period as some of the alleged failures of the minister. “We will step up the protest by holding a demonstration at every taluka and district till we get justice,” Dalvi said. Gaikwad could not be reached for her comments. State Congress delegate Jitendra Dehade said the academic sector across the globe and not just Maharashtra was facing unprecedented issues during the current situation. “Under the leadership of Gaikwad, Maharashtra government has successfully addressed all Covid-related challenges faced by the education department. If MESTA or any other association has been facing some issue, they should hold discussions to seek a way out,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/pvt-schools-org-seeks-removal-of-edu-minister-varsha-gaikwad/articleshow/84768366.cms||---

Following initial treatment and healing of her facial wounds at Chandrapur Medical College, Prajakta was shifted to Nagpur’s Government Dental College and Hospital on July 15. The attack had left the girl’s upper and lower (maxilla and mandible) jawbones misaligned, and there were fractured periorbital bones. Dr Datarkar, head of oral and maxillofacial surgery department, and his team operated on the kid last Monday. Prajakta needed a facial fixation surgery was she was unable to chew anything due to displacement of teeth.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad's Vastrapur robber caught chilli-handed||AHMEDABAD: An employee of a financial firm was making a call near Vastrapur lake when suddenly a 30-year-old man threw chilli powder in his eyes, leaned into his car, and snatched a bag full of cash. The man would have made his escape had the half-blinded victim not grabbed his getaway two-wheeler, drawing the attention of an elderly passer-by who helped the police nab the thief. Interestingly, while the bag contained Rs 12 lakh, the police also seized Rs 2 crore that was in the car. The incident took place around 3 pm on Monday, said incharge DCP (Zone-1) Harshad Patel. “Sunil Chauhan and Satish Patni, employees of Grow More bullion trading company in Naranpura, had collected cash from a bank in Vastrapur and had put it in their car when accused Ankur Modesara, a resident of Chandlodia, targeted them,” he said. “Modesara parked his scooter in front of their car, silently walked to Chauhan who was on the phone and threw chilli powder at his face. Before Chauhan could figure out what was happening, Modesara walked to the other side of the car, opened the door, picked the bag and ran for his two-wheeler. However, Chauhan gave chase and got hold of the vehicle, forcing the 30-year-old to abandon the scooter and flee on foot,” Patel said. Witnesses said that Modesara tried to hide behind a car but an elderly citizen, who saw the commotion and realized what was happening, informed two Vastrapur police personnel and got him arrested. Patel said that the cops will probe if Modesara, an unemployed man, was involved in any other loot or offences. An office-bearer of the firm said, “The accused only attempted to loot one bag which contained around Rs 12 lakh. However, cops also seized Rs 2 crore kept in the car.” Regarding this, Patel said, “We looked into the matter. They had withdrawn the money through cheques so it is a clear transaction.” JCP (Sector 1) Rajendra Asari said, “Due to the alertness of PSI M H Raval and constable Avtarsinh Vaghela, the loot in Vastrapur was averted.” Asari said that the money, which the accused tried to loot, was supposed to be given to an angadia firm named Mahendra Somabhai in Navrangpura. Till reports last came in, Vastrapur police were yet to register a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vastrapur-robber-caught-chilli-handed/articleshow/84773891.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||Row between BJP & Sena at vaccination site in Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Govind Kendre, the city chief of BJP’s OBC cell, was admitted to a private hospital on Monday afternoon following an assault — allegedly by Shiv Sena workers. Kendre was said to be unconscious till late on Monday evening. A row broke out at the vaccination site in Garkheda, where a large number of citizens had queued up for their doses amid the current vaccine shortage. Both the BJP and Sena workers have given different versions of the incident. Shiv Sena MLC Ambadas Danve has accused Kendre of showing highhandedness at the vaccination site. “The limited stock of vaccines was to be administered to citizens after handing out tokens, but Kendre took possession of all the available tokens. Later, he started distributing them on his own, claiming that the BJP has taken a lead in ensuring vaccine availability to all,” he said. Danve said Kendre had engaged in such acts in the past too. “Kendre had heated an argument with the Shiv Sena workers who sought an explanation from him for taking all the tokens. He collapsed on his own during a verbal spat with our party workers,” he said, refuting charges of any assault. The BJP local unit, however, said Kendre was forcibly put in a vehicle by the local Sena workers, who later took the BJP functionary to the office of Sena MLA Sandipan Bhumre, where he was attacked. “Kendre has been given the responsibility by the party to promote vaccination among citizens and he was doing his duty. He did not meddle with affairs at the vaccination site,” BJP spokesperson Ram Budhwant said, adding that Kendre was admitted to the ICU. Later in the day, BJP workers gathered at the Jawahar Nagar police station demanding the registration of a case. No case was registered till Monday afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/row-between-bjp-sena-at-vaccination-site-in-aurangabad/articleshow/84768404.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||With pumping stations submerged, water crisis flares citizens’ tempers||Kolhapur: The delay in the arrival of water tankers has irked citizens from several localities of Kolhapur city that have been facing water cuts since Friday. As all the three main raw water pumping stations have been submerged by the floodwaters of Panchaganga river, the supply of drinking water to around 80% of Kolhapur city has stopped. The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation’s (KMC) water supply department is functioning around the clock to ensure the citizens get water through water tankers. However, many citizens had to wait for 12 to 18 hours for the tanker to arrive after the demand is placed. Most citizens had started placing a demand to private water suppliers. The private suppliers are full of the demands and unable to meet the requirements. Ajay Salokhe, the chief hydraulic engineer of KMC said, “Every day since the pumps are submerged, our tankers are making 266 trips every day and provide almost 26 lakh litre of water. Several water tankers provided by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) were stuck along the national highway. Now they have started coming in, which will help plug the shortage to some extent.” Several citizens have alleged that some corporators of KMC are ensuring that their wards or localities get the tankers immediately. However, civic authorities have denied the allegations stating that the equitable distribution of the tankers is being ensured by local authorities. “As the floodwater is receding, we are removing the pumps and other machinery. They need to be heated. We are sending them to big industries with furnaces . We are hopeful to resume water supply in two to three days,” said Salokhe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/with-pumping-stations-submerged-water-crisis-flares-citizens-tempers/articleshow/84768431.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Transplants hit by Covid, 3,7000 in queue for organs||MUMBAI: Ahmedabad resident Vishnubhai Patel has been camping in the city with his 31-year-old son Aniket, who urgently needs a heart and liver transplant. Although he has lived with a congenital heart defect all his life, Aniket’s condition has significantly progressed in the past two years with his liver getting affected now. Simple tasks like eating, walking, talking have become laborious for him. Patel’s hopes of saving his only son hinge on Mumbai’s organ donation programme picking up steam after being badly hit by the pandemic. In what could be reassuring for patients like Aniket, the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC) that distributes cadaver organs has now collated data to show that with appropriate protocols, transplants can be carried out with no increased risk of contracting Covid. It has analysed all 87 transplants carried out in the pandemic period—36 between March and December 2020 and 51 in 2021—and found not a single infection among recipients or healthcare workers. In this period, there have been 40 kidney transplants, 23 liver transplants, 15 heart transplants, and six lung transplants, all facilitated by cadaver donations. “We didn’t see Covid infections after any of the transplants. In the light of this data, hospitals must make efforts to restart their programmes as lives are at stake. There is no data to suggest either recipients or health workers being at risk,” said Dr S K Mathur, president, ZTCC. He added that people living with end stage organ failure face an equal risk of suffering from Covid complications as those with other comorbidities. In 2020, the count of cadaver donations had dropped to 30, a 69% decline from the previous year, as hospitals devoted ICUs and manpower to Covid. This year too, there have been only 17 donations so far. This is even as 3,325 people are waiting for kidneys, 319 for liver, 28 for heart, a dozen for pancreas, nine for lungs and seven for small bowel transplant in the city’s ever-growing list. After last year’s drastic drop, cadaver donations had begun to pick up between January and March before the second wave hit in April. Transplant coordinators, however, say it’s not simply the fear of infections but several logistical problems that have been holding back the programme. “Primarily, the conversion of ICUs for Covid has brought down admissions with head injuries or strokes,” said one of the transplant coordinators. A decline in road accidents too has reduced the number of potential donors. Nephrologist Dr Bharat Shah said that in a few cases, even recipients refused to undergo the transplant fearing Covid. But in some hospitals, things have begun to look up. Dr Satish Javali, cardiothoracic surgeon at Fortis Hospital, said they have started getting calls from people wanting to donate. After 39 heart transplants in 2019, the hospital could perform only one lung transplant in 2020 and one heart transplant in 2021. “We have one adult and three children urgently in need of donor hearts,” he said. “We have begun to get some calls from people wanting to donate. That’s a good sign,” he said. Patel, who is also raising funds for the transplant, is hopeful that his son will find a donor sooner than later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/transplants-hit-by-covid-3-7k-in-queue-for-organs/articleshow/84777540.cms||Sumitra Debroy

On January 25, a broker named Neeraj called up Meena and told him to invest Rs 20,000 in a stock and told Meena that office-bearer of the equity firm Rakesh Reddy would talk with him and give advice to get more income through share market. On January 27, Reddy called up Meena and told him that if he wanted to make more money, he should invest more in some top profit-making shares. Following instructions of Reddy, his personal assistant Abhinav Mishra and Gaurav, Meena kept investing in various shares and ended up paying Rs 8.09 lakh in various bank accounts When Meena sought statement of his investment, the accused persons did not give him any document.

Even though the Covid scenario has improved in Nashik city, the civic body is worried about the third wave that has been projected by the government to begin in September or October. Hence, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has started creating medical infrastructure to provide better treatment to Covid patients. On Monday, Jadhav held a meeting with all department heads and instructed them to do the needful. “The two Covid Care Centres (CCC) at Thakker’s Dome and Sambhaji stadium are being upgraded and will collectively have 500 oxygen beds,” Jadhav said. “We have already procured three Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen plants that are being set up at Thakker’s Dome, where there will be 300 beds. We are also in the process of procuring two more PSA oxygen plants which are to be set up at Sambhaji stadium that will have 200 beds. Both the facilities will be ready by mid-August,” he added. The NMC commissioner said they are adding a total of 1,400 new oxygen beds in civic hospitals in view of the third wave. “Moreover, we are also setting up a new Dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC) facility with a total of 500 beds, including 300 oxygen beds. Three PSA oxygen plants are to be installed there by three large industries under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR),” he said. During the second wave, the daily demand for oxygen was around 80 tonne per day in both civic and private hospitals of the city. Accordingly, the NMC has decided to have a buffer stock of three days i.e. 250 tonne. The NMC is also in the process of buying Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) tanks with a total capacity of 100 tonne.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/put-medical-infra-in-place-by-aug-end-nashik-civic-chief/articleshow/84768469.cms||Tushar Pawar

However, the actions invited criticism from the opposition Congress that they were limited to the local leaders and activists, and according to critics, a fraud of this scale Rs 100 crore as per preliminary estimates, though there reports that it could be to the tune Rs 1,000 crore cannot be executed without the connivance of the higher leaders in the party. According to a communication issued by the CPM, three officials of the bank, T R Sunilkumar, who was the secretary of the bank, M K Biju, who was the manager and C K Jilse, who was the accountant, have been expelled from the party. They are facing charges that they were directly involved in the fraud. The party has also decided to expel the bank president, K K Divakaran, from the party. The bank director board members M B Dinesh, T S Byju and Ambili Mahesh have been suspended from the party. Party Irinjalakuda area committee member C K Chandran has also been suspended for his lapses in intervening effectively at the appropriate time to check the fraud, the communication said. Party leaders Ullas Kalakkad and K R Vijaya have been removed from the district committee for their lack of alertness in taking measures to prevent the fraud. Irinjalakuda area committee secretary K C Premarajan and Karuvannur local committee secretary P S Viswhambharan have also been removed from their posts. Meanwhile, UDF convener M M Hassan rubbished the disciplinary action initiated by the CPM as a calculated attempt to limit the responsibility for the massive fraud on the local-level leaders. “These local-level suspensions and expulsions are meaningless. There were widespread allegations that leaders at the higher level were involved in the fraud. The CPM state leadership should discuss the fraud and take actions against the higher ups in the party. The UDF will resist any attempt to trivialise such a major fraud. The UDF will reiterate,” Hassan said. Meanwhile, the coperative department is planning to initiate revenue recovery action against the officials of the cooperative bank who were allegedly involved in the probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cpm-initiates-action-against-local-leaders/articleshow/84773778.cms||T Ramavarman

According to NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav, 30 MBBS and seven MD doctors have applied to treat Covid patients in civic hospitals. “Apart from this, NMC also received applications from 400 nurses. We will soon issue them joining letters,” he said. The NMC has started the walk-in interviews to recruit various medical staffers on temporary basis to treat the Covid patients during the third wave. This includes around 3,00 temporary health staffers, including MBBS, MD doctors, staff nurses, hospital managers and other posts.

The NMC had recruited around 1,068 health staff during the second wave of the Covid pandemic in February and March. Even though the Covid situation improved in the city with the significant drop in number of Covid patients, the civic body has retained all the temporary staff in view of the third wave of the pandemic projected in September and October. The existing temporary staff include 150 medical officers (BAMS), 100 nurses, 54 pharmacists, 140 ward boys, 70 lab technicians, among others. Currently, the NMC has only 7 MBBS doctors recruited on temporary basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-hire-30-mbbs-7-md-docs-on-temporary-basis/articleshow/84768492.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Ahmedabad||Celebrating handicrafts in time of 3D printers||AHMEDABAD: What would happen to the craft of woodturning when there would be no charpoy adorning modern dwellings? What would happen to Madhubani paintings when a computer can print any design? Would craft be overshadowed by technology? These were some of the questions raised by the ‘Craft+Future=? Speculative Interior Practices’ studio conducted by Rishav Jain, assistant professor at CEPT University and programme chair (MDes ID & IMIAD) at Faculty of Design. The work of the students is exhibited as part of the ongoing virtual summer exhibition. Prof Jain said that the studio motivated the students first to look intimately at various traditional craft forms, ideate about the future technology, and develop their own perspective on connecting the two. Before the pandemic struck, the students could interact with the artisans and some also worked on their prototypes before working on their final projects. “Technology will invariably become part of crafts as we know it, but we also need to change the common perception of craft. The amalgamation of man and machine can also develop something unique – something we wanted to tell these young designers,” said Prof Jain. “The students also took up a space and reimagined it with craft ranging from bamboo work to metal work and wood to painting traditions.” Sucheetra Pradhan’s project took a 2BHK residence in Ahmedabad and tried to reimagine it with modular craft, naming it ‘craft-ular.’ Pratiksha Nair’s project took an abandoned factory site in Ahmedabad and imagined it as a space where the visitors can understand the craft process with zero waste. Similarly, Ayooshi Jain’s project reimagined GPO as a way to experience self’s journey through craft clusters and installations. City-based experts said that it’s always a fight between modernity and tradition, where many art forms are now getting contemporized through merchandize and mass products. But it has also caused concern about artisan families who are largely dependent on the traditional knowledge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/celebrating-handicrafts-in-time-of-3d-printers/articleshow/84773869.cms||---

Pawar visited several flood-affected areas in Sangli district and also held discussion with the authorities. Pawar said that the places where landslides have taken place had their green cover protected and no damage to the ecology was ever done to these places. “The green cover was intact and the chances of landslides were therefore less. So, to understand the phenomenon, we will appoint geology experts to study and report to us the causes so that adequate precautions can be taken,” said Pawar.The figures of rainfall and dam storage levels show that the increased height of Almatti dam on Krishna river had nothing to do with the floods to Krishna, Warna and Panchganga rivers.Pawar said that the only way to minimise loss of life and property due to floods is to permanently shift the residents from localities, which had flooded in 2005, 2019 and now. A decision on setting up a disaster response force at Karad and either at in Raigad and Ratnagiri will be taken soon. Meanwhile, Satara’s death toll has increased to 41. Out of 41, eight people died due to drowning and rest due to landslides. Highest number of deaths have occurred in landslide at Ambheghar in Patan tehsil, which included a girl aged 3 years.Pawar said actual relief work gets hampered due to visits of dignitaries. To avoid keeping the administrative heads in attending the VVIP’s, state has asked district authorities to appoint nodal officers to assist. The state power distribution utility, in the meantime, has managed to restore power connection to 64,094 people in Satara district. The power connections were lost due to the heavy rain and landslides. Work to restore power supply to another 17,520 people was still on. This included the over 10,000 agriculture pumps in the district.The rain and landslides had disrupted power supply to 422 villages in Satara district. After two days of lull in rainfall, power supply has been restored in 363 villages. “I appreciate the effort taken by the employees to restore power supply, when not just the power lines but also the poles had collapsed. They carried poles on their shoulders through hilly terrain to bring power supply back to the villages,” said state power minister Nitin Raut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/geologists-to-study-landslides-pawar/articleshow/84768513.cms||---

The police department and Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) have joined hands to introduce the concept of reclaiming public space, probably for the first time in Gujarat. The entire road around Sursagar Lake will be reserved only for pedestrians from the evening of August 15. “No vehicles will be allowed on the road circling Sursagar Lake every evening from this Independence Day. The roads will remain closed daily most likely from 8 pm till late in the night. We will soon issue a notification regarding it. Alternative routes will also be given for the vehicle movement,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner. Only pedestrians will be allowed in the entire stretch. “People will be able to stroll around the lake, hang out with friends and family and kids too can play without worrying about traffic. It will be a no-vehicle zone free of any noise or air pollution,” Singh told TOI. Singh had discussed the plan with Mayor Keyur Rokadia some days ago and he too had liked the idea and proposed Sursagar Lake as an ideal spot. The civic body will work on the plan and may allow food kiosks to be set up in the stretch. “The idea is to reclaim the public space and give people a spot to hangout in peace. Vadodara is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the state and people here deserve a good public space,” Singh added. The stretch around Sursagar Lake is dotted with historic buildings like Nyay Mandir and Faculty of Performing Arts that were built by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III. A towering idol of Lord Shiva in the middle of the lake adds to the beauty of the spot. Singh said that they will work on creating more such public spaces in different areas of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/only-pedestrian-flow-on-sursagar-rd/articleshow/84771167.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Ahmedabad||AMC seeks to bear Rs 17 crore overbridge cost||AHMEDABAD: After a city-based construction company backed off from contributing their 25% share towards the construction of a rail overbridge over Jagatpur railway crossing as part of a PPP agreement, the civic body has now proposed to bear that cost. A resolution was passed by the roads and building committee on Monday to seek permission from the standing committee on the issue. The cost is almost Rs 17 crore, claims a senior AMC official. The resolution will be taken up for approval by the standing committee on Thursday. The company cited losses during the 2020 and 2021 Covid years for backing out of the deal. According to AMC’s proposal, the developer had agreed to enter into the PPP mode with the railways which was contributing another 25% towards the pass. The remaining 50% was being declared by Gujarat Urban Development Company. Now AMC will pay the 25% share. The bridge was to be a two-lane pass over the railway line. The concept of PPP mode was first propounded in 2017. The Chandlodia railway pass was one of the few such projects undertaken in PPP mode. “A formal proposal will be placed for approval before the standing committee after which 25% project cost will be borne by AMC,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-seeks-to-bear-rs-17cr-overbridge-cost/articleshow/84773883.cms||---

The four dams in the Khadakwasla circle — Khadakwasla, Panshet, Varasgaon and Temghar — cater to most of Pune city. The stock in Bhama Askhed, which is Pune’s fifth source of water, was at 79.6% on Monday evening. The storage in the Pavana dam, which supplies water to Pimpri Chinchwad, increased to 80% on Monday evening. The dam received around 11mm rainfall.  The stock in Panshet reached 85.5% on Monday after the dam recorded 24mm rainfall throughout the day. Water release from the dam was likely to begin if the storage crossed 90% and heavy spells in the reservoir’s catchments continued, an official from the irrigation department said. Water storage in Varasgaon and Temghar increased to 74.8% and 63%, respectively. Monday’s stock was almost 13 TMC more than the stock that the dams held on the same day, last year. Meanwhile, water discharge from the Khadakwalsa reservoir continued on Monday. The discharge was increased to 3,242 cusec in the evening from morning’s discharge of 791 cusec. “The quantum of water released from Khadakwasla into the Mutha river is being changed depending on the inflow of rainwater into the reservoir. There has been a drop in rainfall activity in the catchments. However, the rain has not stopped completely,” an official from the irrigation department said. The Khadakwasla dam catchments received 10mm rain till Monday evening. Temghar and Varasgaon recorded 40mm and 23mm rainfall, respectively. “Panshet, Varasgaon and Temghar have recorded a steady rise in water levels. The water will be released if the stock in these dams surges beyond 90%. The release from the dams will be increased in a phased manner,” the official added. The city lifts around 15 TMC water from Khadakwasla circle every year. The four dams can hold 29.14 TMC live stock of water. The remaining water flows for agriculture to the rural areas via the Mutha canal. The irrigation department has already started the act of releasing of water into the Mutha canal at the rate of 1,155 cusec.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/after-heavy-spells-lifeline-dams-hold-more-water-than-punes-annual-quota/articleshow/84773854.cms||Sarang Dastane

Pujari was brought from Bengaluru to Ahmedabad earlier this month in connection with a shootout on Pragnesh Patel, an independent councillor in Borsad, in January 2017. Two bike-borne persons had opened fire on Patel. It was later found out that the two men belonged to Pujari’s gang. Sources close to the development said that Pujari’s voice samples were taken during the process. “The call recordings will be matched with the samples, which will connect the gangster firmly to the case,” said an investigator. “The samples will also come handy in other cases involving Pujari, too.” Out of 70-odd offences registered against Pujari, 14 are registered with city crime branch. It includes charges of murder, extortion and criminal intimidation. “Further questioning is on,” said an investigator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ravi-pujari-undergoes-voice-spectrography/articleshow/84773860.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra first to fully vaccinate 1 crore citizens||MUMBAI: Maharashtra has become the first state in the country to fully vaccinate over one crore people against Covid-19. As on Monday, the state had given two doses to 1,00,99,524 people—nearly 11% of the total 9,37,98,052 fully vaccinated across India—while 2.15crore have got the first jab. Considering the state’s total adult population of 8.5crore, it means barely 12% people are fully vaccinated and 25% have got one dose. While UP remains at the top of the chart having administered most doses among states at 4.52crore, the number it has managed to fully vaccinate is barely a little over 73lakh. Maharashtra has administered 4.17crore doses since the national drive kicked off on January 16. Starting with over 230 centres, vaccination centres have now increased to 4,100 in the state. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, health, said the momentum of the drive would depend on volume of doses received. “After Monday's sessions, we have more than 16 lakh doses,” he said. Vyas said floods may disrupt transport and affect vaccination in some villages. Ratnagiri, for instance, administered less than 400 shots on Monday. Though Raigad too has been hit by the floods, it managed to vaccinate over 8,000. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and health minister Rajesh Tope lauded the health department for achieving the feat. The maximum vaccinations have been in the age group above 45 years where 74.28lakh have got both doses while 1.01crore have got one dose. In the 18-44 bracket, about 4.5lakh have got vaccinated with both doses while 99.56lakh have got the first dose. Among healthcare workers, 8.97lakh have been fully vaccinated while 3.88lakh have taken a single dose. And over 11lakh frontline workers have been fully vaccinated while a little over 10 lakh have taken the first shot. Among districts, Mumbai has administered the highest doses at 69.66lakh followed by Pune with 59.12lakh doses. After a few days of lull, a total of 88,019 people got vaccinated in the city on Monday. The 18-44 group makes up the bulk of daily vaccinations followed by the 45-59 bracket. Count of pregnant women who have taken the vaccine is inching towards 200 (181).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-first-to-fully-vaccinate-1-crore-citizens/articleshow/84777578.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Later in the day, other vehicles, barring two-wheelers, were also allowed to use two lanes of the highway. At 10.15 am, the first truck carrying petrol entered Kolhapur from the Sangli phata-side. An earth-moving machine had first been deployed to check the depth and current of the water on the highway. The truck then slowly made its way across the flooded stretch and reached the other side near the Shiroli bridge over the Panchaganga river, much to the relief of not just the district administration and the highway authorities, but also the thousands of truck drivers and motorists stranded on either side. Ranjit Yadav, a truck driver from Uttar Pradesh, who crossed the flooded section on Monday morning, said: “I had been stuck here since Friday. The residents of Kolhapur ensured that all of us (who were stranded) got food, water, toothbrush, etc. People here were very good to us.” Kolhapur superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawade said, “A trial run was done on the flooded stretch by sending in an excavator and a JCB in the morning. The highway stretch at Kolhapur reopened on Monday morning. Only one lane was operational till the evening and that too, only for essential vehicles and trucks carrying milk, water, oxygen, petrol, diesel, etc. Later, when the water had receded further, all vehicles, except two-wheelers, were allowed on two lanes. Two-wheelers will not be allowed till the highway stretch is completely clear of floodwater,” he said. Deputy CM Ajit Pawar, speaking on the frequent waterlogging of Pune-Bengaluru National Highway during floods, said, “The highway needs to be elevated. The matter comes under the Centre’s jurisdiction. We will request highways minister Nitin Gadkari to find a permanent solution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-nh-48-reopened-for-all-vehicles-except-2-wheelers/articleshow/84768665.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Residents in Chellanam allege improper installation of geobags||KOCHI: The sea erosion woes of Chellanam residents continues with the monsoon strengthening as the temporary protective measures announced by the state government is yet to be implemented in many parts of the coastal hamlet. Though the irrigation department has started the installation of geobags along the coast, the residents alleged that they were installed unscientifically and most of the worst-affected places are yet to receive the bags. Many places have started witnessing slight sea erosion already and it is expected to be worse by August first week. Residents said that the works, which were supposed to be concluded before the monsoon began, are lagging due to the inefficiency of authorities. Earlier in May, the state government had announced Rs 2 crore as an emergency fund to ensure temporary measures like the installation of geobags and cleaning of numerous canals there. The authorities started filling the bags with sand but they failed to tie it properly and stack it to form a temporary barrier along the coast. As a result, many of the bags are getting damaged with the sand being washed away by the seawater when the waves hit them. “The Tauktae cyclone has led to the complete destruction of the seawall and now the remaining rocks cannot even obstruct small waves. The geobags will act as a temporary seawall if properly installed but most of the filled bags are being destroyed due to unscientific installation. Moreover, bags are not installed in many of the places,” said Jinson Veluthamannungal, coordinator of Care Chellanam. Meanwhile, irrigation department officials said that the works were progressing in many places and would be completed within a week. “Frequent rains have affected the works at some places but we are ensuring its speedy completion,” said an official. Meanwhile, residents of Chellanam staged a sit-in protest on Monday demanding lasting solution to the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/residents-allege-improper-installation-of-geobags/articleshow/84771269.cms||---

The catchment areas of the upstream dams such as Koyna, Warna, Dhom, Kaner and Urmodi received light to moderate rainfall on Monday. These dams discharged water at the rate of about 50,000 cusec into the rivers downstream that ultimately join the Krishna river. The Krishna river had attained had risen to 54.6 feet on Sunday afternoon, and the level started receding after that. The water had, however, not reached the 2019 flood level of 57.5 feet this time. On Monday, around 20,000 residents of Palus and Miraj tehsils were evacuated. A team of 70 Indian Army jawans have reached Sangli for rescue and relief work. “As the rescue work is coming to an end, we have initiated estimation of the damages caused to farms, properties, livestock, and public infrastructure. We have requested citizens from other districts to come forward and help in the relief work. The administration is focusing on sanitation, cleaning and health works.” The discharge from the Koyna dam was at 30,000 cusec. Koyna area received 34mm rainfall, Mahabaleshwar got 32mm and Navaja got 23mm rain. The inflow into the dam has reduced to 66,000 cusec per hour in the past 24 hours.

Flood water had gushed into the pumping stations operated by Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC), making them non-functional. The PMC has also sent skilled manpower to repair the pumps at the water supply facilities there. “The demand had come from the KMC for providing tankers and other aid. Our tankers and support staff have reached Kolhapur,” said Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of the PMC’s water department. He said that the team, including supervisor and electricians, would be stationed at the flood-hit areas for around a week. KMC officials said the water department staff was working on a war-footing to restart the supply. Only 10% of the city could get water from the KMC’s direct water supply system on Monday. Ajay Salukhe, hydraulic engineer, KMC, told TOI that it would take around a week to restart the facilities. He said that the repair work at one pumping station was likely to start by Monday night or Tuesday. The repair work of the remaining two would start in the next couple of days. As per the KMC officials, if one pumping station starts in the next couple of days, at least 30 MLD water could be made available and nearly 30% population would receive water. But the rest 70% would have to depend on tankers till all the stations become operational, an official said. “The educational institutions and police departments are helping in refilling the tankers. Even some industrial estates have made their private water sources available to us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tankers-technical-staff-rush-to-kolhapurs-aid/articleshow/84773901.cms||---

Around 1,900 ambulance workers have gone on indefinite strike, the union said. “Around 4,600 ambulances remained stranded in 75 districts of the state since midnight,” said Hanuman Pandey, president of UP Ambulance Karamchari Association, UP. Each district has been given four to five ambulances for emergency use during the strike. Mission director (MD) of National Health Mission (NHM) Aparna U has called the ambulance association members for talks which were on by the time of filing of this report. While officials from the health department claimed that the strike was called off after talks, ambulance association members refuted it and maintained that the strike will continue until all their demands are met. When asked about the reason behind the strike, Pandey, president of the ambulance workers association in UP, told TOI, “The government has given the contract to run 108 and 1o2 ambulances to a new firm. After this, 19,000 employees hired by the company that is currently running the services will become unemployed.” “We all are working for the government since 2012. We have worked even amid pandemic. This is what we are getting in return. We are all experienced, why we are not being hired again. Government must ensure that even if the new firm takes over, we don’t lose our jobs.” The government should promise that there would be no salary cuts even if the company running 108 services is changed, Pandey said. “The state has threatened to act against us under ESMA, but we won’t give up,” he added. Due to the strike, several calls from villagers couldn’t be attended. Chief medical officer (CMO) of Meerut, Akhilesh Mohan, told TOI, “Emergency services were not hit in the district. But services of 108 that takes pregnant women from villages to hospital, was affected. We have over 60 ambulances in the district among which just a handful were running amid strike.” After hours of negotiations, officials from MD NHM’s office claimed that the talks were successful and ambulance association members have called off the strike. But the union told TOI that the strike will continue. Brijesh Kumar, state general secretary of UP Ambulance Association said, “We are going ahead with the strike. There were few points on which we came on a mutual understanding with the government, but the strike will continue until all our demands are met.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/ambulance-workers-go-on-strike-in-up-4600-emergency-vehicles-come-to-a-halt/articleshow/84768687.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Delhi||Pandemic weighs heavily on teens, many parents opting for surgery to beat obesity||New Delhi: A senior lawyer recently took his 13-year-old son to a hospital with the complaint that the boy had gained over 12kg in the last 12 months. The year before that, he had put on only 4.5kg. When the doctors examined him, they found that the excessive weight gain wasn’t caused by any underlying illness, but poor lifestyle, like reduced physical activity and increased consumption of junk food. However, this 13-year-old is not alone. The Covid-19 pandemic is fuelling a sharp rise in obesity, especially among children. Nikita Verma (name changed), who lives in Vasant Vihar, said her friends had recently organised a playdate for children. “I was alarmed to see how all the children had gained weight tremendously in the last one and a half years. Observing the same problem in my two children, we hired a fitness trainer who takes the kids to the park daily in the morning and makes them do exercises for an hour,” she added. Dr Anupam Sibal, paediatric gastroenterologist and group medical director at Apollo Hospital, said excessive weight gain was fairly common among children as most of them were at home. “All schools are closed and classes are being held online, which has disrupted the normal routine of children. There is no fixed time for meals and physical activity is almost nil. All this is fuelling a rise in obesity,” he added. “It’s extremely important that parents realise that, more than ever before, a balanced diet and regular exercise is essential for the well-being of children. Parents must lead by example,” said Sibal. World Health Organisation says childhood obesity is associated with a higher chance of obesity, premature death and disability in adulthood. In addition to increased future risks, obese children experience breathing difficulties, increased risk of fractures, hypertension, early markers of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and psychological effects. Dr Shanu Srivastava, senior psychologist at Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, said obesity may result in disorders like anxiety, depression, low self-esteem and sleeplessness in children. “Obese kids become afraid of socialising as a result of being bullied. They always feel judged and start avoiding social gatherings. I had a patient whose grandparents used to tease her because she was fat. She developed an eating disorder and her performance in studies also decreased,” she added. Many public health specialists advocate resuming schools in a phased manner to ensure proper education and overall improvement in the mental and physical health of children. In India, there are few studies to assess the impact of lockdowns on childhood obesity. However, a study conducted on 41 overweight children under confinement throughout March and April last year in Verona, Italy showed the restrictions negatively impacted their diet, sleep and physical activity. Compared with behaviours recorded a year earlier, the children ate an additional meal per day, slept an extra half hour, added nearly five hours daily in front of phone, computer and television screens, and dramatically increased their consumption of red meat, sugary drinks and junk food. Physical activity, on the other hand, decreased by over two hours per week. “School environments provide structure and routine around mealtimes, physical activity and sleep — the three predominant lifestyle factors implicated in obesity risk,” Myles Faith, a childhood obesity expert and co-author of the study was quoted in a report published in Science Daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pandemic-weighs-heavily-on-teens-many-parents-opting-for-surgery-to-beat-obesity/articleshow/84807005.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

On Monday evening, only one dam gate was open discharging water at 2,828 cusec into the Bhogawati river. In all, 74 barrages in the district are still submerged. In the Shirol taluka, rescue operations are being carried out by the Indian Army, NDRF and district disaster rescue teams as several villages including Rajapur, Rajapurwadi, Bastwad, Khidrapur, Sainik Takli, Nrusinhwadi are flooded with Panchaganga and Krishna river water. Major Sohan Singh Bisht of the Indian Army said: “The army, on being requisitioned by the state administration, is carrying out humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in Kolhapur district’s Shirol taluka. On Monday, five teams, along with the NDRF and district taskforce, successfully helped 120 stranded civilians in Rajapur, Rajapurwadi and Khidrapur villages.

Shaktiman, having 11 offences against him of thefts and burglaries, was the alleged mastermind behind the murder of Swayam Nagrale, who was stabbed to death inside an autorickshaw in front of his house in Kaushalya Nagar last Friday. On the following day, Shaktiman was brought to the locality by the friends of Nagrale and assaulted with stones. The assailants had fled after injuring Shaktiman grievously. He was rushed to GMCH and was on ventilator support. Following the murders, police have started regular raids and patrolling in Kaushalya Nagar.

---||Pune||Experts push Railways for plan to tackle landslips||PUNE: Landslide experts have called for round-the-clock monitoring of the northeast (Kasara) and southeast railway (Bor) ghat sections, as well as an efficient system to drain rainwater in these areas. Geologist Satish Thigale said deforestation was a major reason for the landslides and added that the horizontal placement of rocks too contributed. “Both ghat sections have basaltic rock, which formed because of rapid cooling of lava and tend to develop cracks easily. Most of the railway ghat sections have steep slopes and horizontal rockfaces susceptible to falling,” Thigale said. On Thursday, several trains, including three plying between Mumbai and Pune, were cancelled after heavy downpour triggered multiple landslides disrupting railway movements along the southeast and northeast ghat sections. A Central Railway official had told TOI that boulders fell on the railway tracks due to the landslides and heavy water logging occurred at many spots on the southeast ghat section areas before Karjat. “Railway authorities need to develop a system to prevent water accumulation in the ghat areas. The rocks will develop cracks, become weak at joints, causing landslides if water is not drained. A horizontal boring system along these sections can help drain water swiftly. Afforestation is also important. The state government and other agencies concerned should have more tunnels if they are planning a road through the ghats, rather than just cutting through and building roads,” Thigale added. Environmentalist Sachin Pukekar said the reasons for the landslides were manmade. “Landslides are natural phenomena, but frequent landslides are manmade — deforestation, building high-quality roads through every ghat section and forest fires are among the main reasons,” he said. Railway authorities said they were focusing on restoring rail traffic in the ghat areas for the moment. “Almost all the restoration work has been completed and trains are running to an extent. Once we complete this task, we will investigate the matter and take the necessary steps,” a senior Central Railway official said. During Thursday’s deluge, around 38 locations, along both the ghat sections, witnessed train disruptions due to waterlogging, washout of embankments, boulders on the tracks and landslides. Kasara received 136mm of rain in just four hours, while Karjat got 86.8mm in an hour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-push-railways-for-plan-to-tackle-landslips/articleshow/84773950.cms||Joy Sengupta

The cardinal has also urged the government to take care to plan developmental projects in such a way that it may not affect the existence of historically important places of worship and churches used by several of the faithful. His statement was against the backdrop of the high court order regarding land acquisition for highway expansion. Alencherry added that the government machinery concerned should take care to implement the 2013 Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Fair Compensation Act on time and with accuracy in case of relocating places of worship. The government should give fair compensation while taking over private properties as well. The cardinal appreciated the Kovval Azhivathukal temple authorities for showing the way for the society by giving up the property of the temple for the expansion of NH-66 and said that everyone should show the willingness to act with the common good in mind. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/relocate-places-of-worship-for-road-projects-alencherry/articleshow/84773946.cms||---

On reaching her destination, she asked the driver to halt the bus but he did not oblige,” inspector Amruta Kate said on Monday. “Instead, the driver accelerated the bus in a negligent manner. Gaikwad felt a jerk due to sudden acceleration, lost her balance and fell out of the bus. She died on the spot of multiple head injuries,” Kate said. Kate added, “We had initially filed a complaint relating to accidental death and had launched a probe to find a cause of death. After recording the statements of other passengers on the bus, we have now booked the driver for causing death due to negligence.” The inspection of the bus had revealed that the exit door next to the driver’s cabin was open even though it should have been closed while the bus was moving, which was negligence on the driver’s part. “We have filed an FIR under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Motor Vehicles Act. A notice will be served to the PMPML driver directing him to cooperate with the investigations as he is booked under bailable offences,” Kate further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-driver-booked-for-causing-death-due-to-negligence/articleshow/84773951.cms||---

Meanwhile, activists, Vernon Gonsalves and Gautam Navlakha have moved pleas from jail, seeking interim bail on grounds of health concerns. The court also received a similar interim bail plea from activist and academician, Anand Teltumbde. The court recently rejected Teltumbde’s plea filed on merits of the case. The prosecution has been directed to submit replies. The court was also apprised of Delhi University associate professor Hany Babu’s (54) health condition. He was earlier admitted to the hospital. The NIA has alleged that on December 31, 2017, Elgar Parishad at Shaniwarwada, Pune, was funded by the banned CPI (Maoist) as part of a conspiracy to create unrest. The investigating agency alleged that provocative speeches by the activists of Kabir Kala Manch promoted enmity between various caste groups. This, they said, led to the caste clashes, on January 1, 2018, at Koregaon Bhima.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-case-against-swamy-abated-by-nia-court/articleshow/84777581.cms||---
---||India||24x7 power possible in 2 years, says Jain; unlikely, says Goa power minister||PANAJI: Challenging the Goa government to provide uninterrupted power supply, Delhi power minister Satyendar Jain on Monday assured Goa that the Aam Aadmi Party would ensure 24x7 power supply within two years of forming the government in the state. Insisting that uninterrupted power supply is not technically possible, his Goa counterpart Nilesh Cabral said that AAP was trying to hoodwink voters and create a vote bank. Jain clearly had an upper hand in the debate as he caught Cabral on the wrong foot a couple of times, particularly when Cabral said that Goa procures power from Chhattisgarh and Himachal Pradesh. The AAP minister also managed to get under Cabral’s skin by provoking the BJP minister with multiple references to the “buying and selling of MLAs” in Goa. “If AAP forms the government in the next two years, the state will show how 24×7 electricity will be provided. Otherwise, our power minister will resign,” said Jain. To this Cabral shot back and said Goa’s hilly topography makes it difficult to ensure continuous power supply particularly during the monsoons. “It is not that we are not trying to give power 24x7 in Goa. We are also doing it and it is only during the rainy season that the interruption starts,” said Cabral. “Goa will be bankrupt if free power is given to Goans. We cannot be a debt state.” The hyped face-off between Goa’s Cabral and his Delhi counterpart Jain was held at the Menezes Braganza hall in the state capital. While the debate drew in thousands of views online, the attendance at the venue was poor, with a huge posse of Goa police personnel keeping participants at bay. This is most likely the first time in India that power ministers of two different states or Union territories have engaged in a public debate. Cabral said that the state government is working towards uninterrupted power supply. “There are two types of disruptions, one is at the distribution side and the other is at the incoming side. Within the next two to three years, because it takes time, we will be able to have uninterrupted power. We cannot give free power. We can give subsidised power,” said Cabral. Jain said that Cabral was only making excuses. AAP’s promise to give free power to consumers who consume up to 300 units of power did raise concerns about the impact it would have on Goa’s precarious state treasury. Unlike the Delhi government which has a high GST revenue collection, Goa’s revenue is on the decline. Cabral said that unlike the Delhi power model which subsidises low consumption users, Goa subsidises all consumers by keeping electricity tariffs low. In Delhi, bills for consumption of up to 200 units of electricity is waived off while consumption between 200 and 400 units of electricity is given a 50% discount. The tariff slabs in Delhi vary from Rs 3 per unit to Rs 8 per unit while in Goa the highest tariff is Rs 4 per unit. Jain said that power tariff slabs would not be increased if AAP forms the government. He said that money saved by drastically reducing transmission losses will help cover up the 300 free units of power given to people. Countering the BJP’s claim that only Delhi residents with second homes in Goa will benefit from the 300 free units, Jain said that all those consuming less than 300 units should vote for AAP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/24x7-power-possible-in-2-years-says-jain-unlikely-says-goa-power-minister/articleshow/84778673.cms||Newton Sequeira

Non-essential shops are not allowed to function on weekends. On Sunday evening, the Chakan police team found Sanjay Phulware’s shop open, with four customers inside. “When the police team told Phulware to down the shutters, he started abusing them,” said an officer from the Chakan police. Phulware also threatened a constable, who had fined him few a weeks ago. “When the police told Phulware to pay a fine, he snatched the order copy from one of the constables and threw it away,” the officer said. Phulware has been arrested under section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shopowner-held-on-charge-of-abusing-cop/articleshow/84773991.cms||---
---||Kochi||Tree felling case: Kerala high court questions govt’s impunity||KOCHI: The high court on Monday criticized the state government for violating legal provisions through government orders. The criticism was in the judgment denying anticipatory bails in the Muttil tree-felling case. The criticism by Justice K Haripal was in the judgment on anticipatory bail pleas filed by the three brothers who are the main accused in cases over alleged mass tree-cutting at Muttil in Wayanad. The accused had cited a government order to justify the tree-cutting and had contended that the government is the real culprit. In the judgment, the court said, “It is not necessary for the Court to make any comment, sitting in bail jurisdiction, on the argument of the learned counsel that the Government is the real culprit in the entire episode. But it is disturbing that statutory provisions are being infringed by issuing executive directions with impunity. Apex Court has in catena of decisions held that, when Government is competent to amend statutory provisions even retrospectively, it cannot be whittled down by executive orders.” The court declined anticipatory bails to Roji Augustin (46), Anto Augustin (33) and Josekutty Augustin (40) of Moongananiyil House at Vazhavatta in Wayanad. Roji is the proprietor of Surya Timbers in Wayanad. Dismissing the pleas, the court said setting the law in motion by registering forest crimes is justified. Conduct of the petitioners is capable of inferring commission of forest offences, the court said, adding that they managed things by manipulating records and influencing officials. After perusing the documents, the court said the petitioners had neither obtained tree-cutting permits nor transit passes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/court-questions-govts-impunity/articleshow/84773990.cms||---

We will convey it to their parents who have been called for a meeting on Tuesday,” medical college’s dean Dr Varsha Godbole told TOI. The decision was taken after second year MBBS students named five third year students in their statements given to the 12-member anti-ragging committee which is probing the first-ever ragging incident at the medical college. It was in wee hours of Saturday last that around 60 second year MBBS students were made to stand in a line and asked to do 100 sit-ups by their seniors. The college has already terminated two junior residents from orthopaedic and surgery departments while it is seeking help from the police department for action against a third student who was accompanying the duo. The trio allegedly came into a car and asked third year MBBS students to make second year MBBS students do sit-ups. One student had even collapsed while doing sit-ups. “The police inspector had remained present during our meeting today (Monday) and sought a report from us. We have submitted our report to the police department so that action against the former student who is not working with us in any capacity can be taken,” Godbole said. “We are waiting for the anti-ragging committee’s report. Once we get the report, we will file a complaint against the concerned persons. We have also deployed some cops at the medical college to avoid any untoward incident,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/five-ty-mbbs-students-to-be-suspended-from-hostel/articleshow/84771268.cms||---

So far, the city has reported 107 chikungunya cases and 113 cases of dengue in July. In comparison, the city had reported 81 cases of chikungunya and 85 cases of dengue by June 30. During the same period last year, the city had only seven cases of chikungunya and 87 cases of dengue. Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav on Monday directed the officials to increase steps to destroy mosquito-breeding spots. Rajendra Trimbake, a health official of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), said the intermittent rainfall since May end had led to accumulation of water at various places. “In May, most of the industries were closed due to Covid-19 lockdown. Hence, rainwater was accumulated in the premises of industrial units in both Satpur and Ambad industrial areas of Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC). This has led to creation of the mosquito-breeding spots. Both the industrial estates are located in the jurisdiction of the NMC,” said Trimbake. He added that they had started taking measures to curb the rising cases of dengue and chikungunya. “We have already formed 36 teams for the entire city to identify and destroy mosquito-breeding spots,” he said. He added that they had seized over 750 waste vehicle tyres that were lying at various houses or shops. They have also started spraying and fogging in various parts of the city. They have appealed to citizens to ensure fresh rainwater does not accumulate in drums, pots, tyres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vector-borne-diseases-go-up-this-month-in-nashik/articleshow/84768716.cms||Tushar Pawar

The victim, identified as Rekha, a resident of CTS Basti, Kalyanpur, who runs a tea kiosk in front of a private hospital close to Kalyanpur police station, has been admitted to a hospital. The woman in her complaint alleged that one Vinod, a canteen operator of the hospital, first indulged into heated arguments with her asking her to remove her kiosk from near the hospital. “It was when she offered resistance, he pinned her on the ground. He then kicked her and rained punches. Thereafter, when she tried to raise an alarm, Vinod picked up a knife and severed her nose. After this, he threatened and said that now it will not be good for you, if you set up a tea shop again in front of the hospital,” she alleged in the complaint further.

The eight bridges have been sanctioned through the funds of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development and Central Road Fund (CRF). “When it rains, the rivers and rivulets in Surgana quickly swell and submerge the low-lying bridges. The connectivity between the villages and the taluka headquarters gets snapped. People have to walk a few kilometres to the other side,” said Gorakh Mahale, resident of Barhe, Surgana. Keshav Pawar, another resident of Surgana taluka, said the schools are not in session now, but otherwise, children get stuck in other villages. Many a times, the health facilities remain inaccessible Surgana tahsildar Vijay Suryawanshi said the eight new bridges will be much higher and safer. MLA Nitin Pawar said the bridges would come up near Barhe, Datrichapada, Ghagbari, Palsan, Rokadpada, Khadki, Chirai Bubli and Waghdhond villages.

---||Nagpur||Cardiac check-up of dengue +ve must: Doc||Nagpur: Citing his 2013 research, a city cardiologist has advised that echocardiography — a high-end medical investigation of heart — of all dengue patients must be done to ensure the vector-borne disease has not affected its functioning. The reminder comes amid a spike in dengue cases after a gap of couple of years. This month alone, the city has recorded over 100 cases, while three patients have died between May and June. Against this backdrop, cardiologist Dr Shantanu Sengupta said, “Every dengue patient should undergo cardiac assessment too.” “Generally, it is assumed that dengue deaths occur due to low platelet count, which is not the case as per our study. During the study on 80 patients, mostly from Hingna and Wadi areas, we found 10% to 20% had developed heart ailments. The complication could be prevented in rest of the patients due to timely intervention,” said the CMD of Sengupta Hospital, where the study was done during the 2013 outbreak. The study titled ‘Left ventricular myocardial performance in patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever and thrombocytopenia as assessed by two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography,’ was authored by Sengupta and three others. Dr Abhijeet Nugurwar, Dr Kunda Mungulmare (both from Nagpur) and Dr Bijoy Khanderia (USA) were the other researchers. Dr Sengupta said dengue fever treatment must start at early stage. “We identified the heart issues not only by ECG but also through echocardiography, which is strain imaging. It helps in identifying sub-clinical heart involvement. If it is done properly and picked up early, fatality can be prevented. Sixteen dengue patients who were part of the study had heart involvement and one died. Mortality was less than 1%. After this research, doctors have started using strain imaging on dengue patients,” Dr Sengupta claimed. Senior consultant physician Dr Vimmi Goel said, “Cardiac involvement in dengue fever is a common occurrence. This can be easily monitored with readily available tests such as ECG, 2D echocardiogram and cardiac enzymes. Damage to heart muscles can cause heart failure-like symptoms, which can be easily picked up by bedside echocardiogram. Apart from this, various types of disturbances in heart rhythm can also be due to dengue infection.” Consultant cardiologist Dr Shoeb Nadeem felt cardiac assessment is not necessary for all dengue patients. “But for patients with myocarditis — inflammation of the heart — or tachycardia, it is required. Screening is also needed for patients with low heart rate, breathless or drastic fall in BP,” he added.

According to sources, police have closed in on the accused and her arrest is imminent. The woman from Ramankari in Alappuzha has been on the run since last Thursday. Meanwhile, the Bar Association of Alappuzha had decided last week that no lawyer from the association will appear in court for Sessy and it had extended all support to the investigating team. The association had said that it will pursue all legal possibilities to strengthen the case against her. However, a section of lawyers opposed the move by the association of not letting a lawyer from the group represent her. Police had registered a case under Sections 417 (cheating), 419 (cheating by personation) and 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) based on the complaint filed by the association’s secretary Abhilash Soman. The accused had contested and won in the bar association elections held in April this year with a huge majority. She was elected as the librarian of the association. Soman said the association received an anonymous letter that her enrollment as a lawyer was not true. “We checked with the Bar Council and found that another woman was enrolled in the number which the accused had claimed was hers. We gave her 24 hours to submit an explanation. Since she failed to explain her side, we expelled her from the association on July 17 and a police complaint was filed, he said. She had taken her membership in March 2019 and was active in the profession since then in Alappuzha. Meanwhile, police said that the accused was appointed as advocate commissioner in a few cases. Police will be approaching the court to collect details as per procedure, said an officer. Earlier, the police had said that the accused had plans for surrendering before Alappuzha JFMC and had met her lawyer last Thursday. However, she changed plans and escaped at the last minute after realizing that a non-bailable section was filed against her in the police case. Her lawyer came to know about the addition of the third section on Thursday morning and this might have led her to go on the run, said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fake-lawyer-on-the-run-will-be-arrested-soon-say-police/articleshow/84774067.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Surge in demand for weight-loss surgeries at AIIMS||NEW DELHI: After a brief lull, the demand for weight-loss surgery is on the rise again. At AIIMS, doctors say they have been getting 8-10 such patients every week. “This is almost 1.5 times the number we were seeing before the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Dr Sandeep Aggarwal, in-charge of bariatric or weight-loss surgery at AIIMS, adding that almost all patients asking for the surgery needed it. Aggarwal said, “All of them had Body Mass Index (BMI) of more than 35 with obesity-associated diseases like diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea and fatty liver. These patients are worked up comprehensively and prepared for surgery.” Weight-loss surgery is suggested when other measures to reduce weight, like exercise, diet management and treatment of underlying illness that may be causing excessive weight gain, fail to yield the desired result, say experts. “Earlier, many patients would come for weight-loss surgery, but they always wanted to take time to decide on getting it done. Now, people come all prepared for it. They are scared that being overweight could put them at extra risk of developing complications if they get infected with Covid-19,” said Aggarwal. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the US says obesity triples the risk of hospitalisation due to Covid-19. “Obesity is linked to impaired immune function. It also decreases lung capacity and reserve and can make ventilation more difficult,” it adds. A study published in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology Journal, which is based on more than 6.9 million people living in England and includes data from over 20,000 Covid-19 patients who were hospitalised or died during the first wave, found that the risk of worse outcomes from the disease start rising in people with a BMI of above 23kg/m2, which is considered to be in the healthy range. “Risks of hospitalisation were 5% higher for each one-unit increase in BMI and the risk of ICU admission was 10% higher. People who were underweight (BMI less than 18.5) also experienced worse outcomes from Covid-19,” the authors noted. The effect of excess weight on the risk of severe Covid-19 was greatest in people aged 20 to 39 years and decreased after age 60.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/surge-in-demand-for-weight-loss-surgeries-at-aiims/articleshow/84807128.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

These areas are currently attached to eight ward offices mostly in the eastern and western parts of PMC. They may later be attached to the closest wards. The process of delimitation may favour the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and other opposition parties. The BJP-led state government, in 2017, had introduced a four-ward panel system to garner a majority in the civic bodies. The NCP on the other hand wants to hold elections as per the two-ward per panel system. The process of election starts much earlier than the actual date. The state will have to carry out the delimitation of the wards in these municipal corporation areas The ward reservation will have to be well in advance. “The delimitation is a very important process. It decides the limits of the wards. It has to be done before the polls are conducted,” , former municipal secretary of PMC Sunil Parkhi said. The delimitation will impact areas like Aundh, Baner, Kothrud- Bavdhan, Warje- Karvenagar, Sinhagad Road, Ahmednagar Road - Vadgaonsheri, Hadapsar-Mundhwa, Kondhwa-Yewalewadi and Dhankawdi-Sahakarnagar. The villages have been attached to these wards offices. All political parties claim they have a strong presence in these villages. This may reflect on their chances of winning the election in these areas. These parties have sarpanch, ZP members and other elected representatives from these village who are probable aspirants for the civic polls. “The decision to merge the villages is politically motivated. The NCP has added these villages, keeping the elections in mind,” Jagdish Mulik, city unit chief of BJP, said. The BJP has been active in these villages with the local party units being strengthened. Talks of NCP gaining ground here will be proved wrong, he added. The previous elections were held in February 2017. The BJP has a total majority in PMC and is the single largest party. In the Pimpri Chinchwad too, the BJP is the ruling party while the NCP is the second largest party. “Last time, the four-ward system was introduced for the BJP’s political gain which has caused many issues in coordination for the development works,” Prashant Jagtap, city unit chief of NCP, said. He said the delimitation should make sure that one ward or two ward system is re-introduced. Shiv Sena city unit chief Sanjay More said the merger has taken place, but the post poll coordination for developmental works in these villages will be a challenge. “We have a presence in the gram panchayat and zilla parishad. After the merger, these elected members will be able to represent their areas by contesting the civic polls. The development of newly merged areas should take place as per the demand of these villages,” he said. He added that the delimitation should be done in such a manner, that adequate representation is given to the villages. Representation In The Municipal Corporation Observers said the decision as to how many corporators are to be added after the merger is taken on the basis of the population Newly merged areas have a population of around two lakh So if a thumb rule of ‘having one corporator per one lakh population’ is used, only two corporators will be added to the 164 sitting elected members in the PMC Boundary of the wards should be fixed in such a way that no village is neglected Those areas which are far away from each other should not be clubbed together in one ward like it happened after merger of the 11 villages Municipal law experts and the civic administration claim that a timely start to the election process is key for better conduct of the polls. As per the experts, other key aspects of the polls include draft declaration of new wards, inviting suggestions and objections, a public hearing, final publication of wards, publication of draft voter list, final voter list and setting up of polling booths. quote Earlier, the 11 villages were added to the PMC limits, but the expectations about the pace of development have not been fulfilled yet. This should change after the merger of 23 villages Shrirang Chavan of Haveli Taluka Nagari Kriti Samiti I Member of citizens’ group, which had filed a petition in the Bombay high court seeking the merger||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fringe-areas-to-change-geography-of-civic-wards-before-polls/articleshow/84774022.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

NMC had resorted to a once-a-week dry day from last week due to the drop in water level in the dams supplying water to the city as there was inadequate rain. Accordingly, the city did not get water on July 22. But NMC changed the dry day to Wednesday instead of Thursday this week.NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav said water cuts will continue this week on Wednesday and in the meantime, they will have a review meeting about the water level in the dams, which are the source of water for the city. “If there is adequate rain and adequate stock by the time of the review meeting, we will withdraw water cut from next week,” said Jadhav.Gangapur dam complex includes three dams - Gangapur, Gautami and Kashyapi. Apart from this, NMC also sources water from Mukane and Darana dams. The city gets around 80% of the total water supply from the Gangapur dam complex, 12% from Mukane and the remaining 8% from Darana dam. NMC had started once-a-week dry days from last week after the water level in the Gangapur dam had reduced to 25%. But due to good rain, the water level in the dam complex has increased up to 55.68%. The storage capacity of the Gangapur dam complex is 9,350 mcft. At present, the dam complex has 5,207 mcft of water so far. The water level in Mukane dam has increased to 28% so far. while the water level in Darana dam has increased to 78% .Meanwhile, there were three cases of trees being uprooted in the city due to the rain on Monday in the Akashwani Tower area, Panchavati area and the ABB Circle area. Officials of the Shingada Talav fire brigade office said calls came between 10 am to 3 am from the concerned areas. While a tree was uprooted and fell on the compound of a bungalow in the Akashwani area, another uprooted tree had fallen on the road in the Panchavati area.Meanwhile, another uprooted tree fell on the roof of a furniture shop in the ABB Circle due to the continuous rain in the city over the past few days. Fire brigade personnel rushed to the spots and removed the trees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-to-hold-review-meet-on-water-cuts/articleshow/84768745.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Pune||Pune: Rs 1.5 lakh burgled from sweet mart on Salunkhe Vihar Rd||PUNE: The Kondhwa police are investigating the theft of Rs1.5 lakh in cash and that of a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) worth Rs2,000 from a sweet mart on Salunkhe Vihar Road sometime during the night intervening July 24 and 25. According to a complaint lodged by Chelaram Chaudhary, owner of Badhai Sweets, the intruders entered the shop by breaking open the only lock on the main shutter. Sub-inspector Abuzar Chaus said on Monday, “Chaudhary had closed the shop for the day on Saturday at 8pm. The shop has two shutters, including one facing the main road. The owner told police that he had affixed one lock on the shutter instead of two because his employees sleep outside the shop.” Chaus said, “The burglars on finding that the shutter had only one lock, no central locking system and employees fast asleep on the other side of the shutter, used a sharp object to cut the single shutter lock and stole Rs1.50 lakh from the cash box. The burglars also stole the DVR of the CCTV cameras and took to heels.” The burglary came to light after the employees found the shutter open and lock broken on Sunday around 6am. Chaudhary then reported the matter to police. Chaudhary told TOI, “The burglars searched the shop but did not find cash and valuables to steal. They later used a stair case to reach the mezzanine floor, opened the store room drawer and stole cash. They also stole the DVR to conceal their identity and took to heels.” “I don’t suspect involvement of my employees because they have been working with me for many years. There are eight CCTV cameras installed in the shop but we cannot view the footage because the DVR was stolen. I have decided to install a central locking system to prevent any burglaries in future. I have instructed my employees to remain alert,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rs-1-5l-burgled-from-sweet-mart-on-salunkhe-vihar-rd/articleshow/84774063.cms||---

The girl filed a complaint against the trio at Fatehgunj police station. Investigating officials said that one of the suspects had been identified as Brijesh Kanthariya. According to the complainant, the girl was on her way to Manjalpur on a two-wheeler with her relatives on Sunday night. At about 10 pm, three persons, who were travelling on a two-wheeler, cornered her near Polytechnic college. The man, who was driving the two-wheeler, started misbehaving with the complainant and even threatened her. When she tried to take his photograph from her mobile phone, he pulled her down by hairs and began beating her up. The girl’s brother, who was on a separate vehicle ahead, turned back after he heard the commotion. The accused trio abandoned their two-wheeler and fled from the spot. “We have got their residential address on the basis of the two-wheeler’s license plate. I went to the home of the two-wheeler’s owner but he is on the run,” said Wasram Parmar, assistant sub-inspector, Fatehgunj police station. “The girl said that she didn’t know any of the accused or had an argument with them while driving. She has no idea why they attacked her,” Parmar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/20-yr-old-girl-pulled-by-hair-beaten-by-goons/articleshow/84771344.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Flood toll 192, Konkan likely to get more rains in next 3 days||MUMBAI: The death toll in the flood-hit regions of the state rose to 192 on Monday even as rain water receded and two lanes of the Pune-Bengaluru national highway were opened after a four-day gap. Twenty-five people are still reported missing and as many as 3.7 lakh people have been evacuated, the bulk of them from Sangli district. The Panchganga and Krishna rivers in Western Maharashtra remain over the danger mark. The torrential rains mainly in Konkan and western Maharashtra since last Thursday triggered landslides leading to widespread devastation. As many as 95 casualties are from Raigad district alone. The IMD has predicted it is very likely that Konkan, Goa and the ghat areas of central Maharashtra will receive widespread rain over the next three days. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had to cut short his aerial survey of Satara district as his helicopter could not land due to poor visibility. So far, 290 roads are damaged in the affected areas, traffic is closed on 469 roads and 800 flyovers are under water. As many as 9.5 lakh consumers did not have electricity for the last two days, of which connections have been restored to six lakh consumers. Flood water has mostly receded in the Konkan, but flood waters remain high in parts of western Maharashtra. Rescue operations have wound up at the worst-affected Taliye village in Raigad. Meanwhile, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has said “human interference” may not be a factor behind the landslides in the state and the state would appoint a panel of geological experts to study the cause. “The landslides have not occurred in zones prone to them. There is no human interference in these areas,” said Pawar after touring flood-hit Sangli in a life-boat. He added the dam storage levels showed that the increased height of the Almatti dam did not cause the flooding of the Krishna, Warna and Panchganga rivers. “The Koyna dam received 16.5 TMC inflow, its highest-ever inflow of water in one day. Navaja received rainfall up to 32 inches, the highest reported rainfall there. The rainfall was more than the carrying capacity of the rivers and streams. Earlier, we had suspected that the floods were due to man-made things, which is surely not the case,” he said. The CM held a meeting regarding compensation to the flood-affected districts and a final decision is expected at the cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Senior officials said the state government is likely to announce a special package with increased compensation amount along the lines given to the affected districts during the Cyclone Tauktae and even the Nisarg cyclone. Thackeray also suggested rehabilitation of villages and settlements that are in landslide prone areas, including the ill-fated Taliye village. He has also directed the administration to ensure roads and highways should be restored on priority, besides setting up of early flood warning system on seven rivers in the next three months.

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Sanjeev Khanna said that CBI should not just proceed only on the basis of report filed by court-appointed Justice D K Jain committee and it had to proceed as per the procedure. Former Kerala police chief Siby Mathews, who has been named in the FIR along with other 16 people, pleaded the court that the CBI should provide all relevant documents including FIR in trial court so that he could pursue his remedy. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the agency, assured the court that the FIR would be uploaded during the course of the day. “CBI can proceed after registration of FIR... as per law and no directions required from this court. The respondent can take all possible remedies available in law... After registration of FIR, CBI must collect material on its own and not proceed on basis of report submitted by Jain committee which cannot be the sole basis for CBI to pursue the case,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cbi-can-probe-proceed-as-per-law-rules-apex-court/articleshow/84774142.cms||---
---||Delhi||Eased norms help DMRC & DTC unlock some potential||NEW DELHI: With 100% seating now allowed in Delhi Metro and buses, the number of passenger journeys in trains increased from 16 lakh on Sunday to around 22 lakh on Monday. While Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) didn’t share the exact ridership figures, the increase in passenger journeys was 37.5%. Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), too, saw an increase of 38% in ridership. Data shared by DTC showed that its 3,760 buses had ferried more than 11 lakh passengers on July 19, the previous Monday. The figure went up to 13.4 lakh on July 23. On July 26, with the new guidelines of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in place, DTC recorded a total ridership of 15.2 lakh. The increase in revenue primarily earned through farebox collection was much higher (57%), with DTC earning more than Rs 1 crore on July 19. Its earning per kilometre was Rs 20.88 and earning per bus Rs 3,450. The revenue went up to Rs 1.37 crore on July 23 and earning per kilometre went up slightly to Rs 20.99 and earning per bus reached Rs 4,000. On July 26, DTC had a total revenue of Rs 1.58 crore, earning per kilometre was Rs 24.04 and earning per bus Rs 4,611. In a statement, DTC said there had been an improvement on all parameters, like ridership, earning per kilometre, earning per bus, etc with buses plying with full seating capacity. Usually, buses carry 41 passengers with full seating capacity. In pre-Covid times, the “crush capacity” of buses was between 70 and 80 passengers. On the other hand, while up to 300 passengers can be easily accommodated in a Delhi Metro coach, at present only 50 passengers are being ferried. No standing passengers are allowed. Metro users had to not only brave serpentine queues and waiting time of around 40 minutes outside busy stations, but even waterlogging at many places. Saket station had to be closed for more than two hours on Tuesday morning as it had become impossible to access through almost waist-high rainwater. While many passengers had taken to social media to show the lack of social distancing in some coaches and violation of other safety norms, DMRC had said that since Monday was the first day of the revised guidelines, many people were still not fully aware that only 20% passenger capacity was being offered in a train and not 100%, which was the general impression that had been created. DMRC’s nine flying squads kept a hawk-eye on passengers and till 8pm on Tuesday 263 violators had been fined Rs 200 each and 292 passengers were de-boarded from trains for not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Till 8pm on Monday, around 16.9 lakh passenger journeys had been recorded. “Regulated entry, intermittent station closure, if required to maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour, regular announcements inside stations and trains informing the public about social distancing and wearing masks, only seating allowed, and random checks by flying squads to counsel or penalise erring passengers is being done,” said a DMRC spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/eased-norms-help-metro-dtc-unlock-some-potential/articleshow/84807244.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Pune||Pune: Rs 7.5 lakh stolen from Talegaon Dabhade ATM||PUNE: Three unidentified men on Friday night opened a cash dispensing machine machine at an ATM outside a cooperative bank’s branch in Talegaon Dabhade, by using duplicate key and password, and stole Rs7.5 lakh. The theft came to light on Sunday when the bank started receiving complaints about non-availability of cash in the machine. The branch manager, Raju Kamble (50), filed a complaint with the Talegaon Dabhade police on Sunday night. “The theft happened between 9.05pm and 9.10pm on Friday when the guard had taken a break,” Mahesh Matkar, sub-inspector of the Talegaon Dabhade police told TOI. “We suspect the involvement of persons who knew how to operate the machine because the cash was stolen in no time and the suspects knew the password,” he said. Matkar said the bank was closed on Saturday so hardly anyone visited the kiosk for withdrawing cash. “On Sunday, some customers complained to the guard when they could not withdraw cash. The guard informed the manager and was told to put up a ‘No Cash’ board outside the kiosk. In the evening, bank officials discovered the theft when they checked the machine,” Matkar said. The police have recovered CCTV footage on the incident from inside the kiosk. There were three men and their faces were covered with masks. He said the police have collected the details of people who operated the cash dispensing machine. “We are working on some clues,” the officer said. Second such incident in three daysA day after the Talegaon Dabhade incident, Rs15 lakh was stolen from a cash dispensing machine of a cooperative bank in Bhosari. The suspects used a duplicate key and password to open the machine. The Pimpri Chinchwad police swung into action and arrested bank employees for their involvement in the crime. Madhya Pradesh links in bomb scare, theft at ATM kiosk in BhamboliAn officer from the Pimpri Chinchwad police told TOI, “The probe so far revealed that the robbers were from Madhya Pradesh, who had planted bomb at the ATM kiosk in Bhamboli on July 21 and robbed Rs29 lakh. We suspect that the same duo had attempted to steal cash from an ATM in Ranjangaon as well.” The police have detained two persons for questioning, the officer said. Meanwhile, the Pimpri Chinchwad police have called a meeting of the landlords, who have rented out their places for ATM kiosks. “We have told them to submit detailed information about the bank or the agency, which have been operating the ATM on their premises. We have given them forms to fill up with details,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rs-7-5-lakh-stolen-from-talegaon-dabhade-atm/articleshow/84774140.cms||Mihir Tanksale

Periyar EVR College has created an admission facilitation centre on the college premises to help students submit online applications. The online submission of applications will continue till August 8. Like the private colleges, applications were also invited online to the 143 government arts and science colleges across the state. While candidates were asked to log on to www.tngasa.org and www.tngasa.in, colleges were asked to set up admission facilitation centres (AFC) to help students submit applications online. According to an employee of the Periyar EVR College, a total of 19 applications were received on the first day, which include 14 girls and five boys. More than 100 students approached the college to inquire about the admission procedures. The inquiries were more on English, B Com and a few other programmes. Many students were admitted to the aided arts and science colleges, which had started the admission process much ahead of the declaration of the Class 12 results. “The number of students submitting online applications is expected to increase in the coming days, and we expect more students from rural areas to submit the applications,” said a staff from Periyar EVR College. “Most of the aided colleges in the city are done with their admission and those who could not get seats in these colleges would approach the government colleges in the coming days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/parents-students-make-visit-to-colleges/articleshow/84774143.cms||---

While the game is usually played on the synthetic turf in metros, here it was played by clearing a barren land. “While it is cost effective for us, the game is yet to reach a level where we can get sponsors. But there is no dearth of interest for playing the game which has helped in organising such events,” said members Soccer With Attitude (SWAT) football club, the organisers. The two-day event that concluded on Sunday had about 42 teams from local football clubs across districts, which is perhaps one of the biggest tournaments. The game is played with five players on each side. The duration of the game too is less than a conventional football game, such football club tournaments popular in rural areas are turning out to be a treasure trove of talents. Out of the 42 teams that took part in the tournament, Young Blood Red FC of Orthanadu emerged victorious. They received a cash prize of Rs 15,000 and a trophy. Captain of the team, M Swaminathan, 28, said that his football club has existed since 1948 and there are many teenagers in the village who are passionate about the game. The team was also victorious in the tournament organised by Western football club, Athirampatinnam. “Unlike in the past, football club tournaments are gaining popularity in recent years with more football clubs emerging in small towns,” said John Sebastin, 30, secretary of SWAT FC. “The game is not constructed as a pastime as teenage boys are serious about the game especially when they are exposed to soccer tournaments in western countries on the internet,” says M Sathyamoorthy, president cum coach of SWAT FC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/5-a-side-football-tourney-attracts-teams-across-tn/articleshow/84774121.cms||---
---||Delhi||How Tehkhand fell off Delhi’s growth curve||NEW DELHI: Along the busy Ma Anandmayee Marg near Kalkaji, it would be hard to miss the Okhla landfill — a humongous mound of garbage on the outskirts of South Delhi district. Take a left turn past the hotels, hospitals and expensive car outlets, and a new scene opens up before you, the glitz replaced by shabby lanes, crammed multistorey flats and a maze of dwellings. “Welcome to Tehkhand Village” announces Delhi Development Authority’s giant blue boards. There’s nothing welcoming, however, about Tehkhand village. The habitation, which locals claim is more than 100 years old, has in its proximity the overflowing Okhla sanitary landfill, DTC depot, railway yard and a container dry port — all considered essential to keep the city running. But in creating this important infrastructure, the villagers rued having exchanged their land for garbage. Several generations of the Chands have called Valmiki Mohalla of Tehkhand home. Today, Ramesh Chand, 65, a retired railways employee, mourns the destiny of the Gujjar-dominated village. “While our land was acquired by the government at very cheap rates in the 1960s and ’70s, there was no planning undertaken to develop the village,” he muttered. “Instead of direct road connectivity, we have to take a detour to reach home. Sanitation is a mess, the drains are uncovered and encroachments have made life impossible.” With this area, located near Aravali region, having turned into a concrete slum, the villagers apprehend that the newly formulated Master Plan Delhi 2041 has again omitted their development journey. Pandit Om Prakash, head priest at the old Shiv Mandir, said that he has been living in the village for 30 years and can spend hours talking about its problems. “We don’t even have a park where the elderly can sit or children can play. When the wind direction changes, it carries the sickening odour from the khatta (landfill) into our homes,” he said. Tehkhand is built around the mohallas of Mavi, Alla and Churiya with a predominant Gujjar presence and scattered Jatav, Valmiki, Pandit and Nai households. With space now scarce, renting out rooms in their 4-5-floor matchbox houses is a key source of income for many. The migrant population from UP-Bihar work in the nearby Okhla Phase 1 industrial area and 20-30% of the local population in government employment. TOI had earlier highlighted how localities near the landfill get brackish, yellow polluted water, while the groundwater has been contaminated by leachate from the garbage mountain. Villagers also complain that they have no space to park vehicles. Mahendra Pal, 41, of Mavi mohalla said they weren’t allowed to park on the empty lanes of the industrial area. “We face constant congestion and jams,” he claimed. Some villagers felt the overall condition of Tehkhand had become “better after the election of a local politician to Delhi assembly”. Bhupender Kumar was one of them, happy at the relative improvement even if several segments still faced water woes. “There is only one community centre for a population of 50,000,” he, however, pointed out. “So, there is no venue if there are a number of marriages scheduled on auspicious days.” He also wished the vacant land existing around the village was developed into a green belt and a park. Lakhmi Pradhan, a 76-year-old village inhabitant who retired as a locomotive inspector in Northern Railway, said that the villagers had ceded their land to the government in the 1960s for rates as little as Rs 330 per bigha and got nothing in return. “Our gram sabha land extended up to Govindpuri. It was all acquired. But in terms of development, what have we received? Only the city’s garbage at the landfill.” A new engineered landfill is now coming up on 32 acres near Tehkhand. That is hardly heartening news for the villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-tehkhand-fell-off-citys-growth-curve/articleshow/84771962.cms||Paras Singh

State Congress claimed that 2600 tons of fungus and mites infested rice has been distributed in Jabalpur. Taking to Twitter, @OfficeOfKNath said, “In the past also, in the state in September 2020, a central team had detected that rice distributed to the poor were only fit as fodder for animals. At that time, those responsible had started an investigation and made big claims.” प्रदेश में पूर्व में भी सितंबर-2020 में ग़रीबों को जानवरो के खाने योग्य चावल के वितरण का मामला केंद्रीय दल ने पकड़ा… https://t.co/uJj5sDY4JZ— Kamal Nath (@OfficeOfKNath) 1627285142000Kamal Nath was referring to a report sent by the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution which said that during the lockdown period last year, the PDS distributed rice that was fit for consumption by goats and sheep in the tribal districts of Balaghat and Mandla. More than 32 samples of rice collected from these districts were rejected and categorized as unfit for human consumption. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had ordered a probe into the case in September last year. “Now again, the matter of distribution rice with worms-fungus-mite has been revealed,” Kamal Nath claimed. “After all, why is the Shivraj government repeatedly making fun of the poor? Why is rice, fit for the consumption of animals being distributed to the poor?” he asked. The senior Congress leader demanded a high-level inquiry into the fungus and mite infected rice distribution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/pds-rice-unfit-for-consumption-says-nath-seeks-probe/articleshow/84774118.cms||---

The irrigation department, which did a mapping of 26 canals and pinpointed the solutions to address the waterlogging in the city, conducted a presentation on it before the corporation council on Monday. Speaking after watching the presentation, the councillors gave their suggestions which complemented the components in the project prepared by the irrigation department. “We welcome the project prepared by the irrigation department. Still, piecemeal solutions by different stakeholders may not help address the vexed issue of waterlogging in an effective manner. What we need is a drainage and canal master plan,” corporation opposition leader Antony Kureethra. “We have already held talks with various stakeholders. We also conducted site inspections in areas where waterlogging is worse. Then, it was found that the corporation alone can’t implement projects for containing waterlogging. That’s why we knocked at the doors of the government,” said mayor M Anil Kumar. According to irrigation department officials, who conducted the mapping under the leadership of superintending engineer Baji Chandran, eviction of rampant encroachments on the canals is the major step to be taken for solving the waterlogging issue. Dredging backwaters like Chilavannoor and Chittoor river will be required for allowing water from the major canals in the city to run off. “Various factors, including those which stem out of climate change contribute to the waterlogging in the city. So, we will have to prepare a prospective plan taking all these factors into consideration,” said Henry Austin, a councillor. The corporation shouldn’t allow anymore constructions and encroachments on the canals in the city, the irrigation department officials said. “Waste dumping into canals should also be prevented. Rebuilding of some of the culverts which choke the flow of water through major canals should also be done,” Chandran said. The mayor said that the corporation councillors should take immediate steps to prevent littering of waste into canals in their area. “CCTV cameras should be installed for the purpose,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/councillors-demand-master-plan-for-drainages-canals/articleshow/84771384.cms||---

The delinking process is anticipated to accelerate the land acquisition and resumption of construction work to complete the RoB as the district administration has already identified equal value land for the defence ministry. In a recent video conference attended by the defence secretary, Dr Ajay Kumar and chief secretary of Tamil Nadu Dr V Irai Anbu, the defence land requirement for expansion of Chennai, Coimbatore and Trichy airports and completion of Trichy Junction RoB in Mannarpuram was discussed. State highways department sources said that the army is insisting on equal value land at Hanumanthapuram field firing range (HFFR) in Chengalpet district. But, as the HFFR falls under forest area, clearance from competent authority is required to initiate land identification, thus causing a delay. Meanwhile, the state government insisted the defence ministry to delink the land requirement of Trichy Junction RoB clubbed with airport expansion projects that are awaiting defence land. Since the land required for the RoB is small, the state government sought the ministry not to club the long-pending project with airport expansion projects. “Delinking the RoB from the airport expansion projects may help us to get enter upon permission at the earliest. We are working on it.” a source in the highways department said. To acquire 0.66 acres of defence land in Mannarpuram for completing the pending Chennai arm, equal value land was identified in adjacent Tamil Nadu special police battalion campus. “The developments are promising. We hope that authorities get the enter upon permission so that phase II of the RoB will be initiated to decongest Trichy city,” Kallai Venkat, a city development enthusiast said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-jn-rob-delinked-from-projects-awaiting-army-land/articleshow/84774178.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Bypolls first, appointments to boards and corporations later||BHOPAL: With BJP eyeing the upcoming by-polls in one Lok Sabha and three assembly constituencies in Madhya Pradesh, indications by top leadership to delay the appointments in boards and corporations could upset several leaders including the old guards and trusted aides of Jyotiraditya Scindia who had been eagerly waiting for a responsibility in the government or a minister-rank position in a board or corporation. Sources said the senior state leaders and the national leadership is learnt to have put the appointments on the backburner as the party high command has asked to seriously focus on the by-polls after a humiliating defeat in Damoh, in May this year. The national leadership is keen to collect feedback and review party strategy in Khandwa Lok Sabha seat, which has emerged as a bigger challenge for the saffron groups due to Congress' attack on the state and central government amid the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. “The decision on appointments in boards and corporations purely lies with the chief minister. It is up to him to decide the date and time when to assign responsibility in the government. Whether it is before or after the by-polls, the chief minister will take all decisions on his own,” said BJP state spokesperson, Rajnish Agrawal without clarifying on the delay caused in the appointments. By-elections to three assembly constituencies — Raigaon, Prithvipur and Jobat — are equally significant as the party is trying hard to wrest the Congress dominated Prithvipur and Jobat seats. In Khandwa, the Congress may field former Union minister Arun Yadav who holds a sway among OBC voters. Yadav won the seat in 2009 defeating BJP stalwart Nandu Bhaiyya; however, lost to him twice in 2014 and 2019 elections. Now after Nandu Bhaiyya's demise, he is hopeful to wrest the seat from the saffron party. The BJP is not ready to take any chance to lose the seat. Recently, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan held discussion over the party's preparations in the upcoming by-polls and it was decided to involve all senior ministers and state office-bearers to challenge the Congress, who is more confident after its victory in the Damoh assembly by-election. The BJP has decided to form a coordination committee for the elections, though discussions would continue over adjustments of leaders in the organisation and other prominent posts to reach a consensus, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/with-eye-on-bypolls-bjp-may-delay-appointments-to-psus/articleshow/84774155.cms||---

Municipal administration, urban and water supply minister K N Nehru launched the work at Thennur in Anna Nagar. “The UGD revamp proposal will prevent sewage from being discharged into the Uyyakondan canal. The construction work will be completed as early as possible, till then, we request people to offer their support,” the minister said. Traffic diversions are likely to be enforced while implementing the projects on arterial roads. The project to be executed in three separate phases, is slated to be completed by May 2023. Trichy Corporation had proposed to revamp the UGD network in November 2020 after the pipelines became insufficient to handle the volume of sewage in about 34 wards of the city. The existing network was established in 1987 covering Woraiyur, Thillai Nagar, Varaganeri, Tharanallur, Chinthamani, Vamadam, Thennur and Rockfort||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/work-to-upgrade-ugd-network-in-trichy-begins/articleshow/84774185.cms||---
---||Delhi||Dangerous to allow anyone to hoard essentials: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said during a pandemic, when there is general scarcity of medicines and oxygen, it would be against public interest to permit individuals or NGOs to hoard these essential life saving ingredients even for distribution free of cost or for charity purposes. This remark came from a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah on a petition filed by Gautam Gambhir Foundation challenging a Delhi High Court order, on the basis of which the Drug Controller of Delhi had prima facie found the foundation and two AAP MLAs — Praveen Kumar and Imran Hussain, guilty of hoarding essential medicines in contravention of Drugs and Cosmetics Act. Appearing for the Foundation, senior advocate Kailash Vasdev said the Gautam Gambhir Foundation had collaborated with drug suppliers, doctors and healthcare workers to distribute free of cost medicine Fabiflu worth Rs 29 lakh during the second wave of the pandemic. Vasdev said there was no ulterior motive behind the distribution of medicines to the needy and it was done for free and without expecting any kind of favour or personal gain either from those who received the medicines, from the government or any other organisation. He said on the basis of the order, the Drug Controller has initiated prosecution. “People who have rendered service to people during the difficult period of panemic are being punished,” Vasdev said. The bench said it is true that the HC passed the orders without making GGF a party to the PIL. “At the most, you were not made a party to the PIL. The HC had only asked for a status report from the Drug Controller. We will not interfere with HC order. But, we will give liberty to you to become a party before the pending case before the high court. You can appraise HC about your bonafides in doing the charity work.” However, the bench expressed serious reservations against individuals and organisations procuring huge quantities of essential medicines, even for charity purposes. “Otherwise everyone capable will procure the essential medicines and start distributing these to whomever they thought were needy. During the second wave of pandemic, common men were running helter-skelter for essential medicines and oxygen and purchasing medicines at a high cost,” the bench said and cited the scarcity of Remdesivir injection and its sale in black market. It allowed Vasdev to withdraw the appeal and move the HC to become a party in the pending proceedings. Delhi HC had taken serious exception to GGF procuring Fabiflu medicine during the second wave of Covid when there was a serious shortage of the medicine in the capital. The Drug Controller's first report giving a clean chit to Gambhir Foundation was trashed by HC, which termed the report not worth the paper in which it is written. The HC had also taken exception to Gambhir’s statement in the media that he will continue to do such work. “We want to curb this malpractice. This is a pernicious activity. This tendency of people taking advantage and then trying to appear as a saviour when they themselves created the problem has to be denounced. And then, the person goes around saying he will do it again. If he does, we know how to deal with it,” the HC had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-dangerous-to-allow-anyone-to-hoard-essentials/articleshow/84772591.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

In 11 major dams in Konkan region, water stocks were higher than the same period last year. While water stock in these dams was 54.9% on July 26, 2020, it was 60.6% of the total capacity on Monday. Across the state, water stock in 3,267 dams has increased from 39.2% last year to 47.1% of the capacity this year, as per information available on the water resources department website. Ironically, while Konkan has been battered by floods that have wreaked havoc, officials predict several districts in other parts of the state are likely to be hit by a water shortage. In Amravati, there was no change in water stock, which remained at 43%, while Aurangabad, Nagpur and Nashik divisions saw a dip. Water levels in Aurangabad dams were 36% last year, but they declined to 33% this year; in Nagpur division too, stocks dipped from 50.1% to 36%, and in Nashik division, water stock decreased from 35% to 30%. Pune division saw a comparatively substantial increase from 33% to 62%. A senior water resources department official said though there is still time for the monsoon season to end, Nagpur and Nashik might face a water crisis if they do not receive adequate rainfall. “From the present scenario, it appears several districts will be hit by scarcity. It’s a piquant situation. While parts of Nagpur and Nashik divisions are staring at a water shortage, Konkan division is witnessing unprecedented floods,” he said. As per data compiled by the water resources department, Lower Chonde dam in Thane district was stocked to 100% of its capacity last year, but on Monday, it was totally depleted. In more than a dozen dams, the water stock is 100%, while an equal number of dams have no stocks at all, though at the same time last year, they had more than 30-40% water stocks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-water-levels-up-in-konkan-dams-but-several-dists-stare-at-scarcity/articleshow/84776434.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

A travelling ticket examiner (TTE) on the Guruvayur-bound train identified the boy on Sunday by using the photograph of him circulated by the Sevai Railway Children open shelter of Trichy in a WhatsApp group comprising Railway Protection Force (RPF) and government railway police (GRP) staff. After being rescued with the help of ChildLine, the boy was produced before the child welfare committee in Madurai who ordered Sevai Railway children shelter (an NGO in Trichy) to take in the boy and provide him care and protection. Sevai railway children shelter project coordinator J Revathi said that the boy had been rescued from the Howrah Express near Trichy on July 10. Since he spoke Oriya only, the NGO took the help of another NGO working on child welfare in Odisha. They had conversation with the boy through video conference in Oriya. Going by his statement, the NGO said the boy was from a family involved in begging in Bhubaneswar in Odisha. The boy complained of some muscle pain in his legs, so they admitted him on July 19. The doctors advised him to undergo treatment as an in-patient. “The boy was not comfortable getting admitted in the hospital. So, he was insisting on getting discharged, whereas we kept him in the hospital considering his health condition, but he escaped,” said Revathi. Revathi also said that the search for the family members of the boy was still on with the help of an NGO in Odisha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/boy-saved-from-moving-train-within-hours-of-escaping/articleshow/84774144.cms||---
---||Surat||Surat: Hey champ! These stickers will tag you traffic violators||SURAT: The next time you are caught violating traffic rules, you will get recognition as a ‘champion.’ But it’s definitely not a tag to be proud of. For, cops will paste stickers on your vehicle that will read something like ‘No Helmet Champion’, ‘Wrong Side Champion’ or ‘No Parking Champion.’ In a novel way to instill the need to follow traffic rules, the Surat city police have decided to tag offenders’ vehicles with such stickers which will be even hard to remove. These initiatives are being taken by the police as part of the ‘i-follow 21’ campaign started by traffic cops to create awareness for traffic rules. Police are targeting to identify 50,000 people who break traffic rules in the next one month and stickers will be applied on their vehicles. “A good quality adhesive will be used in the stickers so that they cannot be removed easily. Even if the offenders remove it later, the police’s purpose is served as they were made to realize that they have broken traffic rules,” said a police officer. Police have identified three common violations - driving two-wheelers without helmets, parking in non-designated areas and driving on the wrong side - for this drive. “The offenders will be declared as a champion for breaking rules in these three areas in which maximum violation is recorded. These violations also lead to fatal accidents and through this campaign we are trying to save precious lives,” said Ajay Tomar, city police commissioner. At the same time, police will identify 2,000 individuals who are found following the rules strictly. They will be given a cap of ‘i-follow.’ These individuals will be given a card which will be stamped every time when the person is found following all rules. A total of 200 traffic rule followers will be given a trophy if they get five stamps in the card. It should be noted that the Diamond City was the first in the country to have a CCTV-based traffic fine issuing system that was launched in January 2013. Along with the awareness campaign, police will continue to collect cash fines from offenders but the number of persons penalized will be reduced. “We expect people to follow the rules. Police will take help of noted citizens to create awareness and their videos will be shared through social media,” added Tomar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/hey-champ-these-stickers-will-tag-you-traffic-violators/articleshow/84769029.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

It also said the court isn’t examining details of the conditions imposed upon the spa operators.Last week, the Delhi high court had made it clear it expected the state government to take a final decision on re-opening spas in the national capital while taking into consideration that the centres can be permitted to start functioning subject to conditions such as permitting only vaccinated employees and client and curtailing the number of persons at a time.The court’s remarks came on a petition filed by Delhi Wellness Spa Association, which challenged the government’s decision to not open spasm arguing that the move was arbitrary, unlawful, and unwarranted.It stated that while all similar activities have been permitted to be opened, such as gym and salon, Delhi government is yet to permit spas to once again start their operation.On July 5, the high court had sought response of the Delhi government and the Centre on the plea filed by owners of two spa centers, alleging inordinate delay in issuing guidelines to reopen spa centres after their closure in April.The court said that it expected Delhi government to be ready with an explanation as to why spas were not permitted to be open in spite of a January order which directed the reopening of spa centers closed during the first wave of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-allows-spa-centres-to-open-warns-against-violations/articleshow/84772566.cms||---

Taking to Twitter, @digvijaya_28 said, “I agree. This is the truth.

But now, they don’t like my face but still love my voice. They listen to my voice secretly at night. But instead of spying on patriots such as me and thousands of others, had they kept a watch on Pakistani agents sitting in the country, then Pulwama would not have occurred.” He also claimed that PM Narendra Modi who was once his close friend and Amit Shah has spoken to him over telephone for more than a thousand hours. “So far as Narendra Bhai and Amit Bhai are concerned, so far I have spent thousands of hours speaking to them over telephone. I cannot understand why they have to secretly listen to my telephonic conversations,” Togadia said. “This company of Israel does not sell the software to anyone, other than governments. The Government of India should investigate and clarify to the people of the country as to who purchased it. Since it is the government that bought, who paid the money?” Togadia said that he hopes that snooping of patriots and its information is not reaching Pakistan. “After all, what are we doing? The threat is from Pakistan agents, not from politicians of our country, journalists or Praveen Togadia. Pakistan agents are afraid of Indian patriots. Who is this person so afraid of patriots of our country?” He asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/amid-pegasus-row-diggy-comes-out-in-support-of-ex-vhp-chief/articleshow/84774189.cms||Suchandana Gupta

Last week, the civic body had floated a Google sheet inviting applications from such people for vaccination at their home. The move came following state government’s permission for conducting such a drive. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI that the NMC vaccination centres would be running full-fledged for the next two days. “We were planning the drive for bedridden applicants when our centre staff are not busy. The staff would be occupied with the vaccination on Tuesday and Wednesday as we have enough doses. On a day when we don’t have enough stock, the staff can go for the mobile drive,” he said.Joshi said more applications have been received from Mangalwari, Dharampeth and Ashi Nagar zones.“Advanced age of 90% applicants indicate that they may not be able to move out. So there is no point in challenging their claims. We are verifying the claims of younger applicants by seeking relevant documents. Some have uploaded their photos showing their disability. But we don’t rule out that one or two may not have any problem, yet availing the benefit,” he said.Joshi said multiple teams would go to the homes of these beneficiaries and wait or stay in the area for some time after administering the jab. “In next couple of days, we expect to receive more applications. We would be able to give 100 doses comfortably,” he said.Meanwhile, the district recorded over 30,000 vaccinations at 248 government and 20 private centres as the drive resumed on Monday. The NMC and zilla parishad have received fresh stock of vaccines from the state government last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/48-apply-for-vax-by-the-bedside/articleshow/84769003.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Kolkata||Weekend night curb violations in Kolkata jump 2.5 times in two weeks||KOLKATA: An ever increasing trend of violating the night curbs — especially in the weekends from July 1 — has left the cops and public health experts worried. Doctors have warned against such behaviour keeping in the mind the possibility of the third wave. On Sunday, Kolkata Police prosecuted 1,004 persons, the highest prosecution ever for a Sunday night (9pm to 12 midnight) in this pandemic year. On Saturday, there were 1,013 prosecutions, while Friday saw 1,045 prosecutions. “This was the first weekend where we were forced to prosecute over a thousand each day — total 3,062 — under IPC sections 188 and 200 for failing to abide by the night curbs,” said DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha. In the previous weekend (July 16-18), the Kolkata traffic police had prosecuted 620, 608 and 573 people on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, respectively — total 1,801. In the weekend between July 9-11, the cops prosecuted 407, 626 and 246 persons, respectively (total 1,279). Health experts said curbs were put in place to check virus transmission. With a sharp drop in new cases as well as active cases the state strategically planned to ease curbs while allowing livelihood avenues to be opened in a phased manner. But such unrestricted violations can upset all calculations. “People should remember that the virus is still very much lurking around and we all are expecting a third wave. However, we can prevent or decrease the intensity of the third wave if we strictly adhere to the Covid appropriate behaviour that includes putting on hold unnecessary outings,” said Institute of Child Health associate professor Prabhas Prasun Giri. “Such behaviour may invite the third wave without any hesitation. People should have learnt from the gravity of the second wave and must understand the fact that non-adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour is not a choice but mandatory to restrict further spread of the disease,” said Swasthya Bhawan public health specialist Anirban Dalui.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/weekend-night-curb-violations-jump-2-5-times-in-two-weeks/articleshow/84771446.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Although the civic body has one animal birth control centre, the absence of a sterilization drive has led to an increase in the stray dog population in the city. “Two-wheeler riders chased by stray dogs are often getting injured. Even the kids playing on the streets were bitten recently, the civic body has completely failed to control the stray dog population,” P Lenin, urban district secretary, DYFI said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/protest-against-stray-dogs-menace-in-city/articleshow/84774186.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Limiting 50% strength not feasible: Private schools||BHOPAL: As schools reopened on Monday to poor turnout, private school associations said that the state government directives to reopen classes for few students is not feasible for them as they have to bear huge expenses while opening the campuses. “We are asked to open classes with 50% student strength. That too, one class at a time. How can we open schools in such a situation? The entire campus cannot be reopened for 100-200 students,” said Vinny Raj Modi, vice-president of MP Association of Private Unaided Schools.  Missionary schools also voiced their concern. “The state government has not mentioned anything about the fees. Is it possible to open an entire campus for such a small number of students, and that too on the basis of tuition fee charged from students? There are several parents who have not even paid the fee for last year's academic session. Running schools requires heavy expenses. Who will bear the cost?” asked Sojan Joseph, secretary, Bhopal Sahodaya Complex. Missionary schools can think of opening campuses in August only if the state government comes out with a “proper SOP on fees”, he said. “If the government fails to address the issue, it is possible that campuses will remain closed indefinitely. We have incurred huge losses and can’t open like this,” said Joseph. Unlike private schools, the government schools in the state capital reopened classes with a low presence of the students. Except for a few schools, the turn-out of the students was as low as 10%-15%. Several schools were spotted ill-prepared to resume classes. There are 110 government higher secondary schools in Bhopal. Highest turnout of students was around 60 students out of 270 students in the government Excellence school. Even focus of the school education department was found limited to Excellence School as the presence of higher authorities of the department was seen on this campus only. DEO Bhopal Nitin Saxena said that the presence of students will increase gradually. “It is true that the turnout of students was low on the first day. We are expecting to increase the turn out in the near future. However, we are happy that the students have shown keen interest after schools open. Even those students who did not attend classes on day one made several queries about the campus reopening on phone,” said Saxena. While visiting a couple of government schools’ preparation TOI team spotted that schools were not fully prepared to reopen classes. Such was the situation that the entire campus of Govt Mahatma Gandhi Higher Secondary School, BHEL was in darkness for the past 24 hours. “We have made several complaints to the electricity department but nothing has been done so far,” said Hemlata Parihar, principal, Mahatma Gandhi School. Such was the situation that when TOI reached the school gate the teachers were found running to take lectures in the classes. The ill preparation of the school could be gauged from the fact that several class rooms were even not opened. Nowhere, it was found that the senitisation of the classes was done. Even the keys were not available to open the class rooms. “We have got such a huge number of students’ admission this year that it would seem difficult to accommodate in the classes as classrooms were less,” said principal Parihar. No thermal scanning and senitiser was found at Govt Naveen Higher Secondary School, Misrod.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/limiting-50-strength-not-feasible-pvt-schools/articleshow/84774219.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Consent letter remains formality in absence of specific format||BHOPAL: The late decision to allow reopening of campuses made mockery of the ‘consent letter’. The form with consent of parents was must for students to get entry in school on the first day of the reopening. However, in the absence of any proper format from the government, several students brought it to schools to fulfil the formality. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had directed the officials to ensure that students should have a ‘consent letter’ from the parents while attending the classes. But ground reality was far different. It was found that the consent letters brought to the schools on day one was just a piece of paper as no format was given to the students. Students said that they were only asked to bring a signed paper that their parents agreed to send them to school. “Teachers put on the whatsapp group that we have to bring consent letters. They did not mention any format for us. I have brought it today with the signature of my mother that she has allowed me to attend classes,” said a student Prem Narayan. Such was the situation that even the consent letters brought to the school by the students were not even collected by the students and they were allowed to sit in the class. When asked about it, the teachers started collecting at a government higher secondary school. When contacted, school principals reacted that the last-minute decision to allow reopening of the classes made such a situation in front of the students. “I have not given any format on which the consent letters were supposed to be brought. We have asked the students to bring the consent letter on the basis of the last SOPs issued in 2020 while schools were reopened for the first time,” said a school principal without quoting her name. No clarity on parents’ consent letters in the SOPs has left several parents shocked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/consent-letter-remains-formality-in-absence-of-specific-format/articleshow/84774250.cms||---
---||Delhi||DDA needs a fortnight to get its pools ready for use||New Delhi: By the first week of next month, residents of the capital will be able to use the swimming pools at different sports complexes run by Delhi Development Authority (DDA). Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has allowed swimming pools to function as part of its latest guidelines. “We have received an approval to operate our swimming pools. The modalities to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour are being worked out,” a DDA official said. Most of Delhi’s 182 swimming pools are out of bounds for the public as these are located in schools, hotels and clubs. Among all civic bodies, DDA has the largest number of swimming pools. “Out of the 15 pools, 11 will open in August as we need about two weeks to make these operational. The CWG complex is functioning as a Covid Care Centre and there are some issues in sourcing water for the one at Hari Nagar,” he said, adding that two others are being run by licensees who are unwilling to open these facilities at the moment. DDA’s pools become operational during the summer and remain open till September, except for the ones at Siri Fort, and Yamuna and CWG sports complexes, which are heated and operate till November. “We had opened the swimming pools in April but there was a lockdown soon. It is expensive to operate a pool because filtered water must be used, besides maintenance and repair costs. With no certainty about relaxations, we emptied out the water from all pools,” he said. DDMA had issued directions in January, mandating physical distancing of six feet, including in the deck, sitting arena, showers etc. Use of alternate lanes in opposite directions were suggested and swimmers were to shower before and after using the pool. They were also advised to avoid taking pool water in their mouth and, if required, the spitting should be done only in the pool gutter. Sharing of soaps, towels etc was not allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dda-needs-a-fortnight-to-get-its-pools-ready-for-use/articleshow/84807335.cms||Sidharatha Roy

It is alleged that the FIR in the spy case was registered at Vanchipoor police station on the basis of a report filed by Vijayan, who was an inspector with the special branch wing of police. Thampi was the sub inspector at the time. It is alleged that they wrongfully extracted confessions and manhandled the accused while in police custody. In the plea, the former police officers have contended that they have been falsely implicated and that they have only acted in the best interests of police.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced a scheme called ‘Mukhyamantri Covid-19 Parivar Arthik Sahayta Yojana’ to help such families who have lost loved ones during the pandemic. A statement by the commission stated that through its Mahila Panchayat’s network in the grassroots, it had identified 791 women whose husbands died due to Covid-19. DCW has also conducted a social survey of these women so as to help the government rehabilitate them. According to the survey report, 774 (97.85%) of 791 women have at least one child, while 360 women have 3-5 children. Another 30 women among those surveyed have more than five children. From the list of the 791 women, 734 (92.79%) belong in the age bracket of 18-60 years, while the rest are all senior citizens. A total of 191 women fall in the age group of 18-35. While 721 of the identified 791 women are housewives, the rest work as domestic workers, labourers, small business owners and private and government employees. Around 28.5% of women have no source of income, while almost 60% women have a monthly income of less than Rs 15,000, the survey stated. It was also found out that 597 women had not been vaccinated till the date of the survey. “DCW strongly believes that it is important to get these women vaccinated on priority. It has recommended the government to issue an order to the district magistrates to get these women vaccinated,” the commission added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/791-women-were-widowed-during-pandemic-dcw/articleshow/84772608.cms||---
---||Pune||42 students caught cheating while appearing for Savitribai Phule Pune University term tests||PUNE: The Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) has caught 42 students, mostly from the engineering and technology fields, cheating while appearing for the online term exam, thanks to an audio proctoring feature that captures test-takers’ environment for additional sounds and noises. The examination began on July 12. Mahesh Kakade, director, examination and evaluation, SPPU, said some of these cases have been registered due to audio-proctoring. The university had used only image-capturing artificial intelligence-based proctoring methods in the last examination held in April-May when 360 students were caught cheating during the exam. As per the university officials, the students were taking screenshots of the question papers and sending them to exclusive social media groups. Someone from these groups would then send the correct answers to them. From this term, the university included audio proctoring into its invigilation method. An audio proctoring software uses a test-taker’s microphone to identify minute details, such as whispers, low sound levels, mumbling, and other such inconsistencies, to ensure a secure assessment environment. The university officials refused to reveal further details of the process of proctoring, citing confidentiality. A senior official said, “The first thing a student will do if we tell how the proctoring method works is to go online and check how to bypass it. Hence, we are trying to keep it under wraps.” Kakade said that most of the students caught cheating the last time and even this term are from the engineering and technology fields. “My advice to students is to refrain from using any unfair means and appear for the examination honestly. All students who have used unfair means have been punished. Some would not be marked for the examination if they were found cheating, while some of them would be told to repeat the entire term, apart from paying the fine. Isn’t it better to just attempt the examination honestly than suffer the consequences of indulging in malpractices,” said Kakade. He said that the university was trying hard to upload the results on time. “The examination of the engineering faculty will be over within a few days. Since we had tried to complete the final-year examinations of all faculties on priority, it will be completed by August 10. If everything goes smoothly, we will also be able to declare the results from August 15 onwards,” said Kakade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/42-students-caught-cheating-while-appearing-for-sppus-term-tests/articleshow/84771568.cms||Ardhra Nair

State health secretary J Radhakrishnan filed a status report stating that on receiving the proposal, the government would examine the areas needing the state’s facilitation and would take a decision and the same would be informed to the institute. A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that the status report shows an encouraging trend as the state had sought a proposal from AIIMS for starting MBBS admission with 50 students. The judges observed that when a query was raised by this court on accommodation of students, the state submitted that if the proposal is taken forward and implemented, then the students would be accommodated at nearby government medical colleges at Madurai, Theni or Sivaganga districts. Following this, the court sought a response from the Centre in this regard. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by K Pushpavanam, a law student from Madurai district, seeking to establish a temporary campus for AIIMS Madurai to provide OPD services to the people and also sought to commence conducting MBBS courses in the temporary campus similar to that provided in other AIIMS in the country. During the previous hearing, the state informed the court that Centre’s suggestions on MBBS admission in AIIMS Madurai must be examined in the institute’s body meeting on July 16. The court directed the state to file a status report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-seeks-response-on-proposal-for-students-intake-in-aiims/articleshow/84774273.cms||---

Only online bookings will be allowed initially keeping Covid-19 norms in mind. “Preparation to open the zoo from August 1 onwards has begun. The zoo will operate in two shifts as earlier and online bookings will open from July 31,” said Ramesh Pandey, director of the zoo. Only 1,500 slots will be available per shift. While the morning shift will function from 8 am until 12 pm, there will be a break of one hour from 12 pm till 1 pm, when the zoo will be sanitised and disinfected. The afternoon shift will then begin from 1 pm and end at 5 pm, officials say. While the zoo was opened on April 1 this year, it had to be closed down only two weeks later because of the second Covid-19 wave. Prior to that, the zoo was battling with bird flu for over three months. The first positive case was detected on the zoo premises in January 2021. After two consecutive samples of bird droppings tested negative in March, the zoo was able to focus on the reopening process. Zoo officials said visitors would be reminded of Covid guidelines, including keeping their masks on while inside. Prior to the last lockdown, the zoo had added a number of new bird and animal species, taking the total species count from 83 to 88. At present, it has over 90 species with plans to add dhole, which is an asiatic dog, a bear, a lion in exchange of a hippopotamus and two tigresses as well. “Talks are progressing well with other zoos and we have been using this period to add more animals. We may soon see some new additions to the zoo. Our aim is to add 100 species by the end of the year,” added Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/zoo-to-reopen-from-aug-1-allow-3000-visitors-a-day/articleshow/84772606.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Acting on a complaint lodged by lawyer Biswajit Chatterjee, Baranagar police arrested accused Krishanu Mondal (39) from a Noapara hideout. Cops also seized forged documents, including fake CBI ID cards and appointment letters. Chatterjee alleged that Mondal had taken Rs 40 lakh from him and his wife promising them CBI jobs. Chatterjee, a lawyer of Sealdah Bankshall court, had got in touch with Mondal in 2018 following a civil court case. “He had then introduced himself as a CBI officer and also showed his ID card. He also showed some others documents of CBI after which I was initially convinced,” Chatterjee said. The accused even gave the couple fake appointment letters. Chatterjee and his wife Indira, who is also a lawyer, gave him money after the accused made some forged documents in the name of the couple. “He already handed over our ID cards as CBI sub-inspectors and showed us a candidate list in which our names along with some others were mentioned as confirmed employees,” Chatterje alleged. “He was booked for forgery under sections 468, 471, 470 , 472, 473, 419, 420 and 120B IPC,” an officer of Barrackpore commissionerate said.

They said that students won’t attend offline classes till the online facility continues. The poor turnout of students on the day one of the classes resumed has raised several questions for schools and teachers. Teachers said that by running online classes, students can’t be attracted back to campuses. “We have reopened our school and most of the teachers have come. The presence of the students is very low as online classes are still on. But running both offline and online class will be a tough task for teachers,” said Madhavi Sharma, principal, Nalanda Public School. Teachers said that even those students who reached campuses on Monday may not return to the campus in future. “Running online and offline classes at a time will be tough. A teacher can either focus on the students present in the actual class or on those online,” said a teacher Neeru Nigam. Teachers said that they will be exhausted if the online classes too continue. “Teachers have been waiting for the students since morning. As there is no particular time for them to attend classes as the school wants them to encourage offline classes, teachers have to be in school till the final bell rings. It means that the teacher after completing offline classes will have to appear for online classes after school classes end,” said a teacher without quoting his name. Some schools, however, recorded the classes in school and later shared the videos in the online classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/time-to-log-out-of-online-classes-yes-say-teachers/articleshow/84774295.cms||Ramendra Singh

The examination had started on July 12. Students who could not attempt the exam because of Covid-19 can also appear for the re-examination. Over 10,000 students have registered citing various reasons so far. The university will release a detailed schedule for the re-examination soon. The students need to log in via the official examination portal and register a grievance to avail the facility. “Students need to compulsorily register via their own login ID and also upload relevant documents, if needed. Our department will go through the applications and then allow genuine cases to re-appear for the examination,” Mahesh Kakade, the director of examination and evaluation at the SPPU, said. Around 22,000 students were allowed to appear for the re-examination when SPPU had conducted the odd semester examination in April-May. “We also allow re-examination for students, who couldn’t complete the exam because of genuine technical issues, or those whose papers were auto-submitted or those who were infected with Covid-19. This time, as many parts of Maharashtra have been hit by floods, we are allowing the affected students to appear for the re-exam. We will release the schedule so students need to keep a watch on the portal,” Kakade added. Kakade said if the answer sheet had been completed in time and submitted, then it would not be considered. But, such students can go in for a performance improvement scheme whenever the exams are held next. “There were also cases where students chosen wrong electives and hence the hall ticket showed different subjects. We have told all colleges to make a list of such students and submit appropriate corrections from their end. This will be allowed only once and hence it is the college’s responsibility to ensure no student misses out. These students will also be allowed for re-examination,” Kakade added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pupils-from-flood-hit-areas-can-sit-for-re-examination/articleshow/84771545.cms||Ardhra Nair

The court was hearing the petition filed by M Ganesan, father of the baby, seeking compensation and proper treatment for his daughter at a multi-specialty hospital. Justice N Anand Venkatesh said that the petitioner’s counsel submitted that pursuant to an earlier order of this court, the parents went to the government multi super specialty hospital at Omandurar in Chennai where the child was assessed by an expert. They were told that the child would require regular assessment once in six months and whatever best is possible will be extended. “Whatever has been lost by the child by virtue of negligence cannot be retrieved,” the judge said and took note of the government advocate’s submission that the overall function of the thumb will be restricted only to a limited extent and as and when there is any scientific development, the same will be taken advantage of to treat the child. The judge said that the counsel and government advocate submitted that they will circulate the letter to the registry to enable this petition to be heard by this court. If any such letter is circulated, the registry is directed to place it before the chief justice to get appropriate directions. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/interim-relief-to-parents-of-newborn-in-a-week-state-to-hc/articleshow/84774258.cms||---

It is very embarrassing for us to prescribe every drug and item to poor patients, who look up to government institutions like GMCH as a low cost affair,” said Dr Sajal Bansal, president of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), GMCH. The residents have written a request letter to the in-charge dean of their college Dr Sudhir Gupta and in-charge director of medical education and research (DMER) Dr Dilip Mhaisekar in this regard. “Many poor patients leave hospital without treatment because they can’t afford to get the medicines from outside. Basic blood investigations like CBC, LFT, KFT, arterial blood gas etc are chronically not available in the institute. These tests seem very basic, but are very costly for patients when they have to get it done from private laboratories,” the letter reads. The residents have warned of protest if the GMCH administration fails to provide them with the drugs and medical items needed. The ‘not available list’ provided by the GMCH resident doctors is shocking as it also includes very basic things like IV sets, saline, paracetamol, ECG leads, and even TT injections. The list has 46 medicines, drugs and items. Out of them, at least 20 are life saving drugs.“Apart from the dean and DMER, we have submitted the same list to secretary of medical education department. The present situation is worst for poor patients and may become dangerous for resident doctors if someone from the patients’ side attacks us,” said Dr Bansal. Grim Situation Blood investigations (CBC, KFT, LFT, S.E, ABG) cannot be done in GMCHECG leads, TT injections, betadine solutions, sterile and examination gloves not availableCatheter and urobags as well as Intracath are also missing Resident doctors are first to face angry relatives of patients They fear such shortage may end up in assault on doctors||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gmch-facing-never-before-shortage-of-meds-residents/articleshow/84769082.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Madurai||Colleges shouldn’t use students as shield to justify illegal act: Madras high court||MADURAI: Refusing to come to the aid of an engineering college, which hoodwinked the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and illegally admitted students by taking advantage of a mistake done by the AICTE, the Madras high court on Monday took a serious view of the issue and imposed Rs 25 lakh cost on the Immanuel Arasar J J College of Engineering at Kanyakumari district. The amount is payable to the commissioner of technical education to be utilized to refund the fees of those students who underwent the course from 2015-2018. The court also directed the AICTE to initiate penal proceedings against the college for using students as a shield to cover up the illegalities of admitting students in a diploma course without the AICTE approval.The court gave these directions while dismissing a batch of petitions filed by the institution and the students who studied diploma in mechanical engineering college seeking course completion certificates. Justice N Anand Venkatesh observed that it is a technique that is adopted by many institutions, which unauthorizedly admit students without any approval, make them write examinations through interim orders and ultimately, plead before the court by using the students as a shield requesting to sanctify the course undergone by them. The petitioner institution continued to admit students for academic year 2015-2016, though it was well aware of the fact that it was prohibited from making any admissions to the diploma in mechanical engineering course even during the academic year 2014-2015 by an order of AICTE in 2014. While dealing with approvals of other courses, the AICTE by mistake passed an order extended approval for the diploma course as well and subsequently the mistake was rectified by issuing a corrigendum. The institution hoodwinked the AICTE and took advantage of the inadvertent mistake and admitted 89 students between 2014-2015. The institution continued to admit students without any approval during 2015-2016 as well. “It clearly exposes the moral turpitude on the part of the institution. The institutions should never be allowed to use the students as a shield to justify their illegal act,” observed the judge. Observing that the very course is non-est in the eye of law, the judge said that the court can only sympathize with those students who had undergone the course and no relief can be granted to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/colleges-shouldnt-use-students-as-shield-to-justify-illegal-act-hc/articleshow/84774282.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The injured person — identified as Golok Chandra Das (58) — was trapped in the first floor room along with three other family members. All of them were rescued by a police team. Das was rushed to Calcutta Medical College hospital . The incident took place around 1.30 pm and considering the density of the population in the area, the accident could have been disastrous, felt a Kolkata Municipal Corporation buildings department official. On Sunday, a large portion of a three-storied building collapsed in a Bhowanipore neighbourhood. Both the buildings are century-old and needed thorough repair and these buildings were listed as insecure ones, said another KMC official, adding that incessant rains could lead to many more such accidents in the days to come. According to a KMC engineer, the reason behind the collapse of a large number of unsafe buildings lies in the fact that most of these buildings are century-old and made of lime and mortar. “Instead of using cement, the owners of most of these century-old buildings had used lime. When water seeps into the structure after a heavy rain , the lime used as cementing agent weakens leading to collapse of a building,” the civic engineer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/58-yr-old-injured-as-bldg-collapses-in-girish-park/articleshow/84771632.cms||Saikat Ray

Over the coming days, the members will be surveying over 400 acres of the lush green railway land.As reported by TOI earlier, the proposed inter-modal station (IMS) at Ajni will not just lead to environmental damage but also a big heritage loss. Talking to TOI after the visit, convener of Intach Nagpur Madhura Avishkar Rathod said, “Most residential quarters qualify for being categorized as grade-1 or 2 heritage structures. Apart from this, four schools and a church come under heritage category. Though built around 1890, the structures are still intact and have immense heritage value.”These structures didn’t find a place in the heritage list of Nagpur. “Our objective now is to specifically focus on Ajni area and prepare a list of heritage structures. Once this is done, we will submit it to Intach headquarters in New Delhi, as well as the local Heritage Conservation Committee. Apart from these structures, Ajni also has intangible heritage in the cultural aspect,” added Rathod, who is also working as associate professor at Smt Manoramabai Mundle College of Architecture.This move has brought a ray of hope for activists, who have been fighting to save thousands of age-old trees and heritage structures at Ajni ever since the IMS project was announced. “I am happy that Intach Nagpur has taken active steps towards listing built, natural and cultural heritage structures at Ajni. Nagpur being the capital of Central Provinces, is a living witness to the industrial revolution that took place in India, railways being one of them. To develop such a great infrastructure, railways has developed an elaborate neighbourhood at Ajni that is sustainable,” said architectural conservationist Sandeep Pathe.The green and heritage together make Ajni a prestigious land for the city said environmentalist Anasuya Kale Chhabrani, adding, “We appeal to the Intach team to enlist Ajni Vann in the list of natural and architectural heritage. We would also request them to send a recommendation for the same to the head office of archaeological department in central and state ministries so that they also acknowledge the treasure of Ajni’s heritage, safeguarding something built 100 years back, and may not be possible to be crafted today.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/intach-surveys-ajni-vann-area-to-list-natural-cultural-heritage-structures/articleshow/84769138.cms||Manka Behl

---||Delhi||Delhi: ‘Fund crunch could delay Amrapali projects’ construction by NBCC’||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court’s intervention by taking over Amrapali to complete the housing projects under its supervision seemed to have not infused much confidence among existing and potential buyers to invest in the Group’s pending projects. The court-appointed receiver informed the SC on Monday that only 20 buyers showed interest to purchase flats when 52 unsold flats were put on sale recently and only Rs 425 crore have been paid so far by the existing homebuyers though their total dues are over Rs 3,500 crore. Senior advocate R Venkataramani, who as a court-appointed receiver is managing the affairs of the Amrapali Group and exploring all options to raise funds, told a bench of Justices U U Lalit and Ajay Rastogi that there could be delay in completion of all housing projects and the three-year deadline promised by NBCC needed to be extended. The court had in July 2019 took over control of the Group and roped in NBCC, which promised to complete construction in various housing projects within three years and sought fund of Rs 8,500 crore. Over 46,000 buyers have invested in Amrapali’s various projects. Though the construction work is going on at various projects but it likely to be hit by fund crunch as homebuyers are not paying their dues and purchasers are not coming forward to buy through auction of assets of Amrapali Group and its directors, which are to be sold as per the SC order. Advocate M L Lahoty, appearing for homebuyers, told the bench that various orders passed by the court were not being complied with. He informed the bench that SBI Capital had promised in September last year to infuse around Rs 625 crore on the court's persuasion but the amount has not so far been released. “In spite of repeated assurances given by various banks and the consequential orders passed by the court, most of the banks have not released the required funds to the buyers and consequently, the homebuyers, mostly from their own sources, managed to deposit Rs 450 crore out of the total Rs 3,624.65 crore due from them,” Lahoty said while pleading the court to direct various authorities, including banks, to comply with its order. He said recovery of Rs 912.72 crore from directors, CFO and other relatives of promoters/directors was yet to be done and NBCC should also undertake the task to sell unsold inventory of Amrapali Group as it could fetch Rs 2,337 crore. The receiver, however, said he is taking all steps to generate funds but the process got delayed because of the Covid pandemic and assets were not being auctioned as people are not showing interest in purchasing the property at market price. Agreeing with the contention of the receiver, the bench said there was need to galvanise the process and decided that it will hear the case on every Monday to monitor the developments and pass appropriate orders to streamline the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fund-crunch-could-delay-amrapali-projects-construction-by-nbcc/articleshow/84772553.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

---||Pune||Two teachers & HM quit Wablewadi model school||Pune: Pune zilla parishad’s (ZP) poster school in Shirur’s Wablewadi village that had received national recognition is in the middle of a controversy after three teachers, including the headmaster, resigned last week citing external interference in the daily operations of the school. A probe has been ordered into the resignation of the teachers. The school’s teachers and the gram panchayat, in 2013-14, gathered funds and introduced international education techniques and built a new premises on 2.5 acres with air-conditioned classrooms, solar power, tablets to students, a Wi-Fi campus, botanical garden and much more through CSR initiatives. The school has an e-learning laboratory, robotics, a synthetic track and a hall for cultural events and has grown from just 32 students to 550 and has over 3,000 waiting applications. Some local leaders have filed a complaint with the Pune ZP stating that there were financial irregularities in the operation of the school improvement bank account along with an allegation that some in the faculty were planning to resign from public service to start a private school. One of the teachers who resigned spoke to TOI on Monday said, “I felt speechless when the allegations regarding financial irregularities were made and the entire staff felt extremely heavy in the head and our hearts were painful. We never thought we would see this day as we have sacrificed, personally and professionally, to make this school futuristic.” According to a parent, the financial part of the school operations is managed by the gram sabha while the operational part is being looked after by the teachers. “A few parents joined by political leaders from the vicinity started making allegations regarding financial irregularities a couple of months ago and it likely started after their wards couldn’t get admission as seats were full,” the parent said. The teachers claimed they had no role to play in financial matters.“However, when the allegations started coming in, we felt pressured and had to hand over the operations. So, we decided to resign,” the teacher said. Pune ZP admitted that the school and the faculty have been a success and have transformed a public school. CEO of Pune ZP, Ayush Prasad, said, “We received a complaint from the local MLA about financial irregularities with regard to the operations of the school improvement account along with an allegation that some in the faculty were planning to resign from public service to start a private school. As a procedure, we referred the matter to the taluka team to conduct a preliminary inquiry. Like we do in all cases, we will ensure that no injustice is done to anyone.” Prasad said he was waiting for the report of the inquiry ordered on July 20 and on the basis of the report and the law, they would decide whether to close the complaint or refer the matter for a departmental probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-teachers-hm-quit-wablewadi-model-school/articleshow/84771624.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Varsity officials informed Kalady police, which was probing the case, that the missing answers could possibly be inside a sealed cabinet within the exam department. However, police said it has not confirmed whether the answer sheets that are reported to be inside the cabinet are the same that went missing. Police are also suspicious about the mysterious reappearance of the answer sheets as they were probing the case for the past one week without finding a lead. Police had registered a case under IPC Section 380 (theft) on July 22. Kalady SI PA Davis said that though varsity officials informed them about the possibility of the papers being inside the cabinet, the police need to see it for confirmation. "The police will be opening the cabinet on Tuesday only in the presence of a dog squad and fingerprint experts. We have to ensure that the answer sheets in the cabinet are the ones that went missing," he said. The answer sheets of the third semester MA Sanskrit Literature exam that was held in January were reported missing two weeks back when the varsity officials asked the Sanskrit department to submit the grade sheets for the purpose of tabulating the final result. KA Sangamesan, senior professor and the chairman of exams in the department, said he had returned the answer sheets after evaluation but the head of the department had denied it. Though the varsity syndicate sought an explanation from Sangamesan, they found it not satisfactory after which he was suspended and a police complaint was filed. Meanwhile, Sangamesan alleged conspiracy behind the sudden reappearance of the missing answer sheets. He said that the incident exposed the careless and insecure handling of answer sheets by officials concerned. He also said that he had informed the police about an anonymous call he received earlier stating that the answer sheets would not be found due to a conspiracy. He is likely to move court, filing a defamation suit for the ‘humiliation and agony’ he faced following his suspension. Association of Sree Sankaracharya Sanskrit University Teachers also asked the varsity to revoke his suspension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/missing-answer-sheets-reappear/articleshow/84774376.cms||---

Stocks have piled up at the Vashi APMC vegetable yard and over a hundred truckloads of vegetables have remained unsold in the last few days, leading to decline in prices. Traders said that the situation will return to normal in the next couple of days. “Wholesale prices of almost all vegetables have crashed to the lowest in the season at the Vashi APMC due to heavy downpour damaging the crops and low demand here in the wholesale yard with few retailers turning up. For instance, prices of major kitchen staples like capsicum and cauliflower have dropped to Rs 4-6 per kg. The market is likely to be stable soon,” said APMC vegetable market director Shankar Pingle. All the vegetables are sold in the range of Rs 4-20 per kg at the wholesale market. However, retailers are not passing on the benefit to the consumers and charge them between Rs 50-80 per kg, citing the quantity of damages in their procurement. At the wholesale market, the prices of cabbages are in the range of Rs 8-9 a kg whereas brinjals are sold at Rs 5-7 per kg, cucumber at Rs 10, Tomato and lady fingers at Rs 20 per kg.

Executive director of the NGO A Kathir said that conviction rate of cases registered under the Act is a mere 6 to 7%. “The atrocities will come down only when more victims get justice by improving the conviction rate through proper follow up of the cases right from registering the FIR till completion of the trial before the court. The committee should seek an explanation from the officials concerned when the cases end in acquittal,” he said. “The Act says 25% relief should be given when the FIR is registered, 50% when the case is charge sheeted and the remaining 25% more when the victim gets a favourable judgement. But there is a backlog to the tune of several crore rupees in every district,” he said. Kathir said that the Act not only fixes responsibility of officials who are erring from performing duties but also punishments for them. “However, this is not in practice. Cases should be registered against them,” he added. The state level committee meeting twice a year should review if the district level meetings are properly chaired and scrutinise the minutes of those meetings. They also stressed on creating awareness in schools and at the panchayat level in rural areas on equality to put an end to untouchability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/reconstituted-sc/st-panel-should-ensure-more-get-justice-ngo/articleshow/84774324.cms||---

Managing the family’s expenses was not easy back then. Now, back to work when shops have opened following easing of Covid curbs, he gets Rs6,000.Nafees Ahmed (49), a father of four, has been taking home Rs5,000 after the lockdown. He works in a premium hotel. He had migrated from Delhi through a reference. After 14 years in Nagpur, Ahmed says he has saved nothing. Prior to lockdown he got over Rs12,000. He lives in the accommodation provided by his employer which is the saving grace. Rajiv Gulgawar, also a hotel employee, is the sole bread earner in his family. “My father used to drive an autorickshaw but there is hardly any business after the lockdown and my pay has been halved,” he said.They were among a number of other workers who had joined their employers in a protest to demand further lifting of restrictions. Prior to lockdown, they barely got subsistence wages and now it’s a pittance. By protesting, they hope to get back their earlier wages.Over 300 people, comprising employers and their employees, had joined the protests before the collectorate and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) office, demanding that the timing restriction till 4pm too should be lifted. Sarkar Jagaon Vanijya Bachao, an organization formed by 23 trade associations covering sectors like hotels, bars, restaurants, coaching classes, and marriage laws and resorts, demanded that the restrictions should be lifted as Covid cases have drastically reduced, making Nagpur eligible for full relaxations under level 1 category. The leaders claimed that their sectors are the most-affected due to the restrictions.Dipen Agrawal, who heads the organization, said that the protest was organized considering the conditions of workers. “There were strong indications that many of them would be in dire straits if the restrictions continued,” he said.With limited work hours, salaries too have reduced accordingly, said workers TOI spoke to. Among the better paid were those who were in their late 40s or 50s getting up to Rs40,000 before Covid. With salaries halved, they said their savings have been almost wiped out.Agrawal said there are plans to launch a non-cooperation movement if the demands are not met.Tejinder Singh Renu, secretary of the organization, said the decision is in government’s hands. “The municipal commissioner told us that he has powers to only increase the curbs, not relax,” said Renu.He said that a number of representations to the government went unheeded.According to a bar owner from Sadar, as establishments have to shut down after 4 pm, there is hardly any business for liquor bars. “It’s difficult to recover the wages,” said the bar owner.Representing the coaching classes, Rajesh Bondre said that it was difficult to break-even and some had also sold off the premises. “Even as parents have paid the school fees, their dues towards coaching classes remain but their wards continue to get the tuitions,” he said.“We used to manage with the earlier salaries by maintaining a frugal lifestyle. It’s difficult to meet the expenses towards children’s education,” said a senior hotel employee.Raising his issue, Ratnakar Girdukar in his fifties said that his savings of last three years have been exhausted in the last one and a half year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wages-down-to-pittance-workers-join-bosses-in-protest-to-lift-curbs/articleshow/84769174.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Bhopal||Most private schools stay shut on reopening day in Bhopal||BHOPAL: School reopening began on a rather glum note in Bhopal on Monday as only government schools opened, to barely 10% attendance, while private ones stayed shut. The majority of schools affiliated to CBSE and MP Board were closed on Monday. Private school associations have made it clear that it is not possible to open up campuses and incur expenses on sanitization and upkeep for so few students. The state government has allowed schools to reopen one class at a time, with 50% students coming in once or twice a week. Class 12 physical classes resumed on Monday, and class 11 will reopen on Tuesday. However, most parents are unwilling to send their children to school when fear of a third Covid wave looms, and a vaccine for children is still awaited. Also, what irked parents is the missing consent forms. The government has made parents’ consent mandatory, but schools that reopened on Monday didn’t send any. Parents were informally asked on WhatsApp to send a written consent. There is no fixed format, and parents want a ‘no’ option on such forms. Pvt schools assn to meet edu ministerThere are 72 CBSE-affiliated private schools, including 26 missionary ones, and 450 affiliated to MP Board in the state capital. Schools that had been demanding reopening of classes stepped back when the government allowed them to do so. Vinny Raj Modi, vice president of MP Association of Private Unaided Schools, said, “The state government is only thinking about parents. When everything else is open, I fail to understand what is the problem in opening schools. We have decided to meet the education minister and raise our concern. Till then, we are not opening schools.” The association will present a memorandum to the school education minister in this regard. “We will meet him to apprise him of the ground situation. We also want to open the campuses, but not like this,” he said. Unlike private schools, the government schools in the state capital reopened classes with a low presence of the students on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/most-schools-stay-shut-on-reopening-day/articleshow/84774347.cms||Ramendra Singh

We tried to contact some Silambam masters on our own, but they avoided us,” she told TOI.Mangaiyanavan Foundation, a group of seven physical education teachers who joined hands to introduce sports to transgender people across the state, reached out to Anushiya through newsreader Padmini. “We met the NGO people in January. Though we wanted to learn Kabaddi and Silambam, they suggested we learn throwball first,” said Anushiya. “It felt great, because it boosted our alertness, fitness and general energy level.”Managing trustee of the foundation, 30-year-old Jamuna Rajavellappan, said they did a lot of research on transgender people before registering their foundation in January. “We understood the way they talked, their aspirations, behaviour, triggers and lifestyle. After they mastered throwball, we were confident enough to introduce them to Silambam and fortunately found master Prabhu to train them,” she said.Thirty-five-year-old Jamila, who works as a master in a cloud kitchen, said there are now 20 Silambam students including herself. “Most of them are youngsters. We find Silambam, which we have been learning with sticks, fascinating. It has made us more fit, flexible and we feel healthier and a lot more confident.”The foundation aims to introduce different types of sports to transgender people in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/they-transcend-gender-barriers-to-master-silambam/articleshow/84774401.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: After long wait, small hospitals to begin Covid vaccination||PUNE: Small hospitals/nursing homes struggling to procure Covid vaccine doses for almost two months are all set to begin Covid-19 vaccination on their premises in a day or two in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). Despite having the permission to inoculate, these health facilities had remained out of the drive for more reasons than one since June 1. “Twelve small nursing homes in the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad areas have already started receiving the vaccine doses from Monday. They will start vaccinating people on their premises from Tuesday or Wednesday, as per their plan,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India (HBI) — an association of small hospitals in Pune. Parasmani hospital in Hadapsar received 1,000 Covishield doses on Monday.” We plan to start inoculating people from Tuesday,” said hospital’s paediatrician and director Nivedita Oswal. The hospital had registered the demand for the vaccine doses on the Co-WIN application and made the payment online on July 10. “We faced a lot of delays in getting the doses. But we are happy that we can finally begin the vaccination on our premises now,” Oswal said. The latest vaccine purchase policy mandates hospitals to take the state government’s route on the Co-WIN for purchase orders of less than 6,000 doses. For orders above 6,000 doses, the hospitals can approach the manufacturers directly through the Co-WIN app. However, lack of clarity, gaps in communication, and the government’s vaccine policy undergoing changes every few days have fostered a sense of doubt and insecurity about procuring the vaccine doses among small hospitals. “These hurdles are defeating the purpose of equitable distribution of vaccine doses. Many who initially wanted to participate in the drive have opted out due to the procurement hurdles,” Patil said, adding, “Many of the small setups now want to wait and watch, learn from the experience of others before blocking money.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/after-long-wait-small-hosps-to-begin-covid-vaccination/articleshow/84774359.cms||Umesh Isalkar

But there is less momentum in such an initiative due to the erratic supply of vaccine,” an official said. Nearly 90-100 camps have been set up to vaccinate around 35,000 construction workers. A report submitted during the review meeting on Saturday stated that nearly 23,295 citizens in the category have been so far vaccinated. “However, there are several more waiting for the vaccine and the shortage of vaccine has affected the drive,” the official said. State technical adviser and member of task force Dr Subhas Salunkhe has in his suggestions to the Pune administration that 100% people in the category should be vaccinated. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (health), Pune circle, streamlining the supply of vaccine could enable setting up of more camps for the beneficiaries in the category. Developers, on their part, have taken responsibility for full vaccination of the construction workers. Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai)-Pune president Anil Pharande said the developers had been for the past two months trying to organise vaccination camps, but could not do so due to lack of vaccine. “The construction workers go to the government and private vaccination centres. But these centres are far from their workplace. We have been seeking for supplies, but have not been able to manage any so far,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shortage-slows-down-vax-drive-for-construction-workers-vendors/articleshow/84774422.cms||Nisha Nambiar
