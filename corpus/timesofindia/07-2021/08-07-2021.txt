Byrd Sr., a former Virginia governor, US senator and staunch segregationist, from the state's Capitol Square on Wednesday morning. A crane hoisted the larger-than-life statue off its pedestal and workers then strapped it to a truck to be hauled into storage until lawmakers determine its final disposition. Byrd, a Democrat, ran the state's most powerful political machine for decades until his death in 1966 and was considered the architect of the state's racist “massive resistance” policy to public school integration. Lawmakers voted to remove the statue earlier this year, a decision that came amid a yearslong movement in history-rich Virginia to rethink who is honored in the state's public spaces. The statue erected in 1976 was located a stone's throw from the Capitol. A nearby plaque said the statue was dedicated in appreciation of Byrd's “devotion throughout a long public career to governmental restraint and programs in the best interest of all the people of Virginia.” Byrd's son, the late Harry Byrd Jr., a Democrat-turned-independent who began his career as a segregationist, succeeded his father in the Senate, serving until 1983.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/virginia-removes-segregationists-statue-from-capitol-square/articleshow/84215857.cms||---

His elevation to the Cabinet rank on Wednesday marks an acknowledgement that the former bureaucrat-turned-politician from Bihar has come into his own as a quiet, methodical reformer who has pulled the sector back from the brink and set it on a growth path. From completing the village electrification programme ahead of time, deepening the power market for reducing tariffs, pushing renewables at a breakneck speed to promoting domestic manufacturing, ‘Babu Saheb’ has delivered a sterling performance. The prime minister has shown his appreciation for Singh’s eye for details and a practical approach in tackling issues by retaining him at the helm of the power and renewable energy ministries with Cabinet rank, But challenges still remain, especially in so far as improving discom finances and balancing the low-carbon imperatives and coal’s vital role in India’s energy matrix are concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/raj-kumar-singh-the-quiet-performer-gets-his-due/articleshow/84215926.cms||Sanjay Dutta

The police have registered an assault case against the tourists. A police official claimed at least 16 tourists — seven males and nine females — entered the sub-district hospital at Tangmarg and sought a negative Covid test report without undergoing the test, which is required to visit some tourist destinations. When the staff refused, the officials claimed, seven male tourists attacked the staff, injuring two doctors, Dr Aayaz Ahmad and Dr Tahir, health worker Aqib Ahmad Bhat and Irfan Ahmed Reshi, a teacher on Covid duty. The police were called and were investigating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/tourists-attacked-doctors-wanted-negative-covid-19-test-report-to-visit-gulmarg/articleshow/84216392.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||WHO: 'Extreme caution' in lifting virus limits||GENEVA: The emergencies chief for the World Health Organization is calling on governments to exercise "extreme caution'' in fully lifting restrictions aimed to curtail the spread of Covid-19, warning that transmission will increase as countries open up. Dr. Michael Ryan asked during a WHO news conference to respond to Britain's decision this week to ease restrictions despite rising case counts, says "every country right now is lifting restrictions in one way or the other'' in hopes of striking a balance between a return toward normality and the need to control the virus as vaccinations increase. "Transmission will increase when you open up,'' says Ryan, because not everyone is vaccinated and uncertainty remains about how much vaccination curbs transmission. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, says several factors were driving transmission of Covid-19: The behavior of the coronavirus and its variants; social mixing; reduced social measures; and unequal and uneven distribution of coronavirus vaccines. "The virus is showing us right now that it's thriving,'' she says. "This is not theoretical.'' Globally, there's been nearly 4 million confirmed deaths from the coronavirus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/who-extreme-caution-in-lifting-virus-limits/articleshow/84215400.cms||---
---||World||Peshawar’s filmy transformation: From Bollywood’s cradle to Islamic jihad||ISLAMABAD: Dilip Kumar may have said in his autobiography that he lived in undivided India where “men as well as women mingled freely with Muslims in the market square, wishing each other …”, but by the time he breathed his last in Mumbai on Wednesday, Peshawar had turned into one of the most conservative places in Pakistan. The launch of “Islamic Jihad” in Afghanistan against the former Soviet Union in 1979, Pakistan’s paradigm shift to radicalize the society, former military ruler General Zia-ul-Haq’s drive towards Islamization, introduction of “Kalashnikov culture” and the country’s tribal districts becoming jihadi launch pads for Afghan wars – all that changed the quiet, unruffled world of Peshawar. Then came the bombing of a government school in 2014 that killed 150 people, mostly children. It was about Peshawar that the actor wrote in his book – ‘Dilip Kumar: The Substance and The Shadow’ – “Aghaji (my father), had many Hindu friends, and one of them was Basheshwarnathji, who held an important job in the Indian Civil Services (ICS). His elder son (Prithviraj Kapoor) came to our house with him a few times and he stunned the ladies with his handsome appearance. That was Raj Kapoor’s father Prithviraj Kapoor.” It was not just Dilip Kumar, who was born Yusuf Khan, in Mohallah Khudadad in the city’s ancient Qissa Khwani (story-teller) bazar, many Bollywood legends have roots in the city – from Raj Kapoor and Shahrukh Khan to Madhubala, Vinod Khanna, Amjad Khan and Anil Kapoor. Prithviraj, Raj Kapoor’s father, was the first Hindu Pathan from Peshawar who left a mark as actor and producer in Bollywood. In Qissa Khwani Bazaar, it is less than a 10-minute walk to come across the ancestral homes of three legends of Indian cinema -- Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor and Shahrukh Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/peshawars-filmy-transformation-from-bollywoods-cradle-to-islamic-jihad/articleshow/84216508.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||Bengaluru||Suits to 2nd marriage, Dilip Kumar’s links with Bengaluru ran deep||BENGALURU: Bollywood thespian Dilip Kumar, who passed away at 98 on Wednesday, had a long association with Bengaluru. Not only did he have his preferred hotel room, favourite tailor and close friends among Russell Market flower vendors in the Karnataka capital, but his second marriage was also solemnised at a mosque here. Syed Ahmed Ruman, 53, a tailor, was in tears when he heard the news of Kumar’s demise. His association with the superstar dates back three decades. “I still remember the afternoon when I met Dilip saheb at Taj West End hotel for the first time and he greeted all of us with his evergreen smile. He was such a gentle person and interacted with us like a commoner despite being one of biggest stars of the country,” recalled Ruman. Ruman ran back to his New Officer Shop on Residency Road and began stitching a suit for his favourite star. “During the meeting, I had a good look at him and sized up his measurements. Knowing that he was staying here for a week, I went back four days later with a black suit I had made for him. He tried and it fit him perfectly,” Ruman said about his attempt to impress the actor. Dilip Kumar began placing orders for his suits with Ruman through his assistant DÇosta every time he arrived in Bengaluru. During his visits to the city, the actor would only stay at Taj West End in his preferred room. Senior news photographers at the time say the hotel staff would keep the room vacant all the time for the star since he was a frequent visitor to the city. Shivajinagar was like a second home for the actor and he frequented it several times from the 1960s to 1990s for various events and inaugurations. Many flower vendors of Russell Market have a long connection with the actor, going back to their fathers and grandfathers. A black and white photograph of a garlanded Dilip Kumar surrounded by people from the market still adorns the walls of many shops here. And it is an open secret here that the special garlands for Kumar’s second nikah to Asma from Belagavi at Jumma Masjid on Old Poor House Road were sent from Russell Market. “It was in the early 1980s that the marriage was solemnised by the late Hafiz Junaidi Saheb, the famous head priest of Jumma Masjid,” reminisced Tariq Almeen, a Bengaluru fan of the star.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/suits-to-2nd-marriage-dilips-links-with-bluru-ran-deep/articleshow/84216903.cms||Petlee Peter
---||India||Hours after arrest, top Hizbul commander killed in J&K encounter||SRINAGAR: A top Hizbul Mujahideen commander was killed in an encounter in north Kashmir’s Kupwara district late Tuesday, hours after he was arrested with a grenade from Handwara’s Watyen area during a routine vehicle check. Post-questioning, he had led security personnel to a terrorist hideout in Kralgund, where he tried to attack the forces, triggering the encounter in which he was gunned down, police said. The slain terrorist, identified as Mehraj-ud-din Halwai alias Ubaid from Sopore in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district, was an A++ category Hizb operative. Active since 2012, he was instrumental in luring and recruiting youths for the organisation, besides raising funds for promoting terrorism. Halwai was well-versed in modern technology that helped him plan and execute terror activities. Wanted in several terror crimes, including numerous killings in north Kashmir, Halwai was part of terrorist groups responsible for murdering SPO Mudasir Ahmad Dar of Sopore in 2013, attacking a police party at Hygam in Sopore in 2013 in which four cops were killed, and killing sarpanch Habib Ullah Mir of Goripora in Bomai, police said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, a team of Handwara police and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) was conducting a routine vehicle check at Watyen when it apprehended a man exhibiting suspicious behaviour, IGP (Kashmir Zone) Vijay Kumar said on Wednesday, adding, “On frisking the suspect, we found a grenade and immediately shifted him to the nearest police station for questioning.” During interrogation, the suspect identified himself as Mehraj-ud-din Halwai and revealed the location of a terrorist hideout at Pazipora Renan village in Kralgund, Handwara. He then led a joint team of the Army, SSB, CRPF and Handwara police to the spot for a cordon-and-search operation. “Upon reaching the location, Halwai suddenly picked up an AK-47 rifle that was concealed in the hideout and opened fire at the security forces, triggering an encounter. He was gunned down in the firefight,” the IGP said, adding arms and ammunition, including an AK-47 rifle and four magazines, a power bank, a blanket, some medicines and other incriminating material were recovered from the spot. Sopore on Wednesday observed a partial shutdown in protest against Halwai’s killing, with markets in the old town and main chowk areas remaining shut, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hours-after-arrest-top-hizbul-commander-killed-in-jk-encounter/articleshow/84217037.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Biden visits Illinois to sell voters on families agenda||CRYSTAL LAKE: President Joe Biden on Wednesday turned his focus to pitching his proposed investments in families and education, using a visit to a community college in an Illinois swing district to highlight how his spending on so-called human infrastructure would boost the economy. The president toured McHenry County College, a community college in Crystal Lake with a workforce development program and a child care center. He's trying to sell voters on his vision to invest in child care, health care, education and other important aspects of everyday life for Americans, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday on Air Force One. Biden toured a metals lab at the community college, where he emphasized the need to invest in research and development to bolster manufacturing jobs. ``We've got the best folks in the world, we're just not investing the kind of money we should,'' he said. The president also wants to put a renewed focus on the portions of his economic agenda that didn't make it into the bipartisan infrastructure deal that he backed in June. That package includes hundreds of billions of dollars of investments in roads and bridges, transit systems and broadband, but it constitutes only part of the $4 trillion in spending Biden has proposed in a broader plan to reinvigorate the economy and boost the middle class. On Wednesday, the Democratic president took steps to highlight the rest, including his plans to invest in child care and workforce development programs and provide two years of free community college, universal prekindergarten and paid family and medical leave. He'll make the case that investments in such programs are needed to maintain America's economic growth and competitiveness globally. He'll also highlight his proposals to establish a clean energy standard and invest in home care for seniors and affordable housing. And he'll speak about his plans to make permanent the expansion in the child tax credit and expanded health care premium subsidies from the Covid-19 aid bill. Democrats plan to include much of this in a bill they hope to pass through a legislative maneuver that would require just a simple majority vote, skirting the 60-vote hurdle in an evenly divided Senate. Biden has said he would prefer that the two bills move through Congress together, and Democrats are hoping to make progress this month on both. The Biden administration promoted its agenda on multiple fronts Wednesday. First lady Jill Biden visited an elementary school in Washington to discuss how the trillions of dollars the president wants Congress to spend on families would pay for more affordable child care, preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds, larger salaries for teachers and modern school buildings with safe drinking water, along with more teachers of color and more nurses and counselors to help students with their emotional and other needs. ``You and your students will continue to be one of our top priorities, not just in one legislative bill, but in everything we do,'' she said during a speech to a virtual meeting of the American Federation of Teachers union.'' President Biden was greeted by Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot when he landed in Illinois and was met at the community college by Gov. JB Pritzker; Illinois' two Democratic senators, Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth; and Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood, who represents the district. Biden won Illinois' 14th Congressional District by about 2 percentage points in 2020, and Underwood won reelection by less than that. Hers is one of the top-targeted seats in the nation and is emblematic of the kind of district Democrats will need to hold onto in the 2022 midterms if they hope to maintain control of the House.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-visits-illinois-to-sell-voters-on-families-agenda/articleshow/84217003.cms||---

This was the first major infiltration bid after director-generals of military operations of India and Pakistan had held a telephonic conversation on February 22 to enforce the 2003 ceasefire agreement from February 25. “Early Wednesday, a group of Pakistani terrorists attempted to infiltrate across the LoC in Naushera sector. Alert Army troops, however, thwarted the bid by suitably employing an integrated surveillance grid and engaging the terrorists in a fierce gunfight. In the ensuing fire exchange, the Indian Army killed one terrorist and his body has been recovered,” Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said. An AK-47 rifle, four AK-47 magazines with ammunition and two grenades were recovered from the slain terrorist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/armed-infiltrator-killed-along-loc-in-jk/articleshow/84217096.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||India||Modi inducts four new ministers from Bengal, with 2024 LS polls in sight||NEW DELHI: Four first time Lok Sabha MPs from West Bengal – Santanu Thakur, John Barla, Nishith Pramanik and Subhash Sarkar -- were inducted into the Narendra Modi cabinet on Wednesday, as part of the Prime Minister’s major reshuffle of his council of ministers. The move clearly indicates that BJP focus on the state has not been diluted even as it lost the assembly election to Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress recently, barely two years after the party made unprecedented gains in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, bagging 18 of the 42 parliamentary seats. Two existing ministers of state – Babul Supriyo and Debasri Chaudhury – have been dropped from the cabinet. Supriyo lost his Tollygunj assembly seat in the 2021 assembly polls that he had been put to fight as some of his other colleagues like Locket Chatterjee and Swapan Dasgupta. Instead of giving up on Bengal, BJP plans to build on the strength of 77 assembly seats it won for the first time in the state, with 2024 Lok Sabha polls in sight. Hoping to regain ground it lost in 2021, the four ministers have been carefully chosen from regions where the party either has a good presence like in north Bengal, and where it could improve on its present strength. That ignoring Bengal could cost BJP dearly in a state where it is the main opposition party, when reverse migration to the ruling TMC has become a real threat for the saffron camp, it has chosen Thakur from the Matua community, Sarkar from Bankura (Jungle Mahal), Nishith Pramanik (the youngest minister at 35 years) representing the Rajbonshi community from Cooch Behar and John Barla representing the tea garden workers from Alipurduar. With Barla’s induction, political circles however are curious on whether the Alipuarduar MP’s recent demand for separate Union territory for north Bengal was backed by the party. For, in that case, the BJP unit in Bengal could be wiped out since the people would never support any further splitting of the state. Bankura MP Sarkar represents Jungle Mahal region where BJP was successful in 2019, but lost ground in the 2021 assembly polls. Thakur’s induction is seen as an attempt to woo back the second largest SC community in the state, which exhorts influence in at least five Lok Sabha seats in south Bengal, ahead of 2024 elections. Voting patterns in the assembly elections showed that Matuas did not vote en-bloc for any party and their votes were split between the ruling TMC and BJP. Ridding on the promise of implementation of CAA and NRC, Shantanu won the Bongaon LS seat by defeating his aunt and TMC rival. But in 2021, Thakur had been skipping BJP rallies and came on board at the last moment and also travelled with the PM to Bangladesh in the middle of the Bengal polls and visited Orakandi, the birthplace of the founder of the Matua sect Harichand Thakur with Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/modi-inducts-four-new-ministers-from-bengal-with-2024-ls-polls-in-sight/articleshow/84210581.cms||Mohua Chatterjee
---||World||Haiti President assassinated at home, wife wounded||PORT-AU-PRINCE: Haiti President Jovenel Moise was assassinated and his wife wounded early Wednesday in a gun attack at their private residence, tipping the impoverished and crisis-hit Caribbean nation into a renewed state of political uncertainty. Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph declared a national “state of siege” and said he was now in charge of the country, urging people to remain calm while insisting the police and army would ensure public order. As international outrage and shock spread over the killing, the airport was closed in the capital Port-au-Prince, but witnesses said the city was quiet on Wednesday with no extra security forces on patrol. “The president was assassinated at his home by foreigners who spoke English and Spanish,” Joseph said of the assault that took place around 1:00 am (0500 GMT). “This death will not go unpunished,” Joseph said in an address to the nation. Moise's wife Martine, who was to be evacuated to Miami, was being treated in a local hospital. Haiti's ambassador to Washington, Bocchit Edmond, told reporters the killers were “professional” mercenaries who disguised themselves as US Drug Enforcement Administration agents and may have already left the country. “We have a video and we believe that those are mercenaries,” he added. Moise had ruled Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, by decree after legislative elections due in 2018 were delayed in the wake of disputes, including on when his own term ends. In addition to the political chaos, kidnappings for ransom have surged in recent months, reflecting the growing influence of armed gangs in the country. Haiti also faces chronic poverty and recurrent natural disasters. The president faced steep opposition from swathes of the population that deemed his mandate illegitimate, and he churned through a series of seven prime ministers in four years. Most recently, Joseph was supposed to be replaced this week after only three months in the post. As well as presidential, legislative and local elections, Haiti was due to have a constitutional referendum in September after it was twice postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The United Nations Security Council called an emergency meeting Thursday on Haiti, while US President Joe Biden condemned the killing as “horrific” and said Washington was ready to assist in any way. “We condemn this heinous act, and I am sending my sincere wishes for First Lady Moise's recovery,” Biden said in a statement. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Haitians to “remain united in the face of this abhorrent act and reject all violence,” his spokesman said. Just hours after the assassination, Joseph announced he had declared a “state of siege,” which grants the executive additional powers. Haiti will mark two weeks of national mourning from Thursday. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned “this crime poses a risk of instability and a spiral of violence. The perpetrators of this assassination must be found and brought to justice.” Moise, a 53-year-old former entrepreneur who set up a string of businesses in the north of the country, where he hails from, burst onto the political stage in 2017 with a message of rebuilding the impoverished nation. He campaigned on populist pledges, and was sworn in February 2017. The end date of his mandate became the source of a political standoff. Moise maintained that his term of office ran until February 7, 2022, but others claimed it ended on February 7, 2021. The disagreement stems from the fact that Moise was elected in a 2015 vote that was cancelled for fraud, and then re-elected in November 2016. Without a parliament, the country fell further into crisis in 2020, and led to Moise governing by decree, fuelling growing mistrust of him. The United Nations Security Council, the United States and Europe had called for free and transparent legislative and presidential elections to be held by the end of this year. The killing comes days after Moise appointed Ariel Henry, a neurosurgeon who studied in France, as Haiti's new prime minister. Henry, 71, has been part of Haiti's coronavirus response and previously held posts in the government as interior minister, and social affairs and labor minister. Henry is close to the opposition, but his appointment was not welcomed by the majority of opposition parties, who had continued to demand the president step down. The Dominican Republic ordered the immediate closure of its border with neighboring Haiti after the assassination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/haiti-president-assassinated-at-home-wife-wounded/articleshow/84216975.cms||---
---||World||EU to propose new body to tackle dirty money, documents say||LONDON: The European Union will propose a new agency to crack down on money laundering and new transparency rules for transfers of crypto-assets, EU documents showed on Wednesday as the bloc responds to calls for tougher action to fight dirty money. Europe has come under pressure to step up enforcement of anti-money laundering rules after several countries began investigating Danske Bank over 200 billion euros of suspicious transactions that passed through its tiny Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. Lacking any pan-EU authority to stop dirty money, Brussels has relied on national regulators to enforce its rules, but they have not always cooperated fully. “Money laundering, terrorist financing and organised crime remain significant problems which should be addressed at Union level,” the documents seen by Reuters said. The EU's executive European Commission is proposing a new Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA) that will become the “centerpiece” of an integrated supervisory system also made up of national authorities, the documents said. “By directly supervising and taking decisions towards some of the riskiest cross-border financial sector obliged entities, the Authority will contribute directly to preventing incidents of money laundering/terrorist financing in the Union,” the documents added. “At the same time, it will coordinate national supervisory authorities and assist them to increase their effectiveness in enforcing the single rulebook and ensuring homogenous and high quality supervisory standards, approaches and risk assessment methodologies.” EU AML rules will be made directly binding on member states to stop criminals exploiting differences between national regulators, the documents said. A further proposal would introduce new EU requirements for service providers in crypto-assets to collect and make accessible data concerning the originators and beneficiaries of transfers in those assets. Transfers of such virtual assets are currently outside the scope of EU rules for financial services. “The lack of such rules leaves holders of crypto-assets exposed to money laundering and financing of terrorism risks, as flows of illicit money can be done through transfers of crypto-assets,” the documents said. Sven Giegold, a German Green Party member of the European Parliament, said the European Commission had put together a strong package against money laundering. Parliament and EU states will have final say over the proposed rules. “With uniform standards and more centralised supervision, the EU Commission is introducing important improvements to enable consistent action against financial crime,” Giegold said. The EU should in the meantime pursue legal action against EU states that are not enforcing AML rules properly, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/eu-to-propose-new-body-to-tackle-dirty-money-documents-say/articleshow/84217890.cms||---
---||India||OIC seeks Indo-Pak dialogue, wants to send team to Kashmir||In the middle of the government's J&K outreach, India's ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ausaf Sayeed met the OIC Secretary General, Yusef Al-Othaimeen, earlier this week. In the "courtesy" meeting, the secretary general is said to have asked about the possibility of a meeting between Pakistan and India, stating that the General Secretariat in Jeddah stood ready to assist "if the two parties would so request". The rare meeting is significant as OIC has repeatedly criticised India's decision to reorganize the erstwhile state of J&K and India, in response, has maintained that the Islamic body has no locus standi in matters strictly internal to India, including that of Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. India has also accused OIC of allowing itself to be used for propaganda by Pakistan. The Indian ambassador is said to have again reminded OIC secretary general in the meeting that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral and inalienable part of India. An official Indian reaction is expected later. OIC said in a statement that the Secretary General welcomed Sayeed and reviewed with him a number of issues "concerning the situation of Muslims in India, along with the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, and relevant UN and OIC resolutions opposing any unilateral actions on the issue". He apparently also conveyed to the Indian ambassador the "desire" of the OIC General Secretariat to dispatch a delegation to the "disputed territory" in line with relevant resolutions of the OIC Council of foreign ministers. Pakistan was quick to claim Wednesday that OIC had underscored the organisation’s principled position on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute and expressed appreciation for the organisation's "consistent and longstanding support" on the issue. Islamabad also claimed that this was the first time that the principled position of the 57 OIC-member states has been duly conveyed to India. However, while OIC has repeatedly called upon India to rescind its actions in Jammu and Kashmir, India continues to remind the organisation that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and that it must refrain from talking about the situation there. Th government last year described as regrettable that OIC continued to allow itself to be used "by a certain country" , which has an abominable record on religious tolerance, radicalism and persecution of minorities, to indulge in anti-India propaganda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oic-seeks-indo-pak-dialogue-wants-to-send-team-to-kashmir/articleshow/84217506.cms||Sachin Parashar

In a separate order on Tuesday, the government attached the Rs 52 crore paid by IMA to 100 depositors over and above their principle investments. A division bench on Wednesday directed the government to submit its response to the June 30 letter by Harsh Gupta, the competent authority with regard to the attachment of VK Obaidullah Government School Building for which the IMA Group allegedly received Rs 10 crore contribution. The assets/properties marked for attachment in the government order had been declared by Baig in his election affidavit on April 20, 2018 and their declared worth is nearly Rs 17 crore. They include Baig’s 33% share in a commercial building spread over 30,217 sqft on Hosur Road developed under a joint development agreement with a builder worth Rs 96.8 lakh; another commercial building on Residency Road worth Rs 76.6 lakh; an inherited residential property on Sanders Road; another residential property spread over 13,500 sqft on Cleveland Road worth around Rs 3.6 crore; 4,000 sqft site in HBR Layout; 5,545 sqft site in Fraser Town and 1,844 sqft site on Cleveland Road worth Rs 8.9 crore.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka’s share in Union cabinet up to 6 despite Sadananda Gowda's exit||BENGALURU: Karnataka landed a surprise bounty on Wednesday as PM Narendra Modi inducted four ministers from the state, ending month-long suspense that focused on one or two choices for the Centre. Rajya Sabha member Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP Shobha Karandlaje, Chitradurga MP A Narayanaswamy and Bidar MP Bhagwant Khuba took oath as ministers of state at a simple ceremony in Delhi. With this, Karnataka’s share in the Union cabinet has gone up to six, including parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who is a Rajya Sabha member from the state. Like DV Sadananda Gowda, Karandlaje belongs to the politically influential Vokkaliga community in southern Karnataka. Khuba’s induction is being seen as a move to ensure Lingayat representation in the cabinet following the death of Suresh Angadi, who was minister of state for railways until last September when he died of Covid-19. Narayanaswamy’s induction is being seen as part of the party’s strategy to further consolidate its “Dalit left vote base”. Rajeev Chandrasekhar brings the heft of a tech entrepreneur. This is the first time in recent times that Karnataka has got maximum representation at the Centre. BJP had won 25 of 28 Lok Sabha seats in the state.  Hours before the swearing-in ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan, Gowda resigned as chemicals and fertilisers minister. Joshi was retained by Modi. Party insiders said Gowda’s exit is being seen in the light of poor handling of the supply of remdesivir and shortage of oxygen during the second wave of Covid-19. This is the second time that Gowda has been dropped from Modi’s ministry. The first was in 2016 after a two-year stint. Besides chemicals and fertilisers, Gowda, who represents Bengaluru North constituency, has also held portfolios like railways, law, statistics, and programme implementation. He had taken over the ministry in November 2018 after the demise of former minister Ananth Kumar. The seniority of MPs which used to be a prime criterion for theselection of ministers has been given a go-by.  “It is a well-thought-out selection with an eye on the 2023 polls.

He was the youngest patient to have been diagnosed with the fungal infection in the state. The boy was first brought to the district hospital in Tumakuru in the last week of May with complaints of blurred vision. He was referred to Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health and shifted to Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital on May 25. “He had suffered from Covid, and also had high diabetes (Type 1). He developed multiorgan inflammatory syndrome on Monday,” said Dr CN Reddy, professor, pediatrics, Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital. According to doctors, this was a case of undetected juvenile diabetes which became a major risk factor in mucormycosis. While there was no clarity on his Covid-positivity result, the boy tested positive for Covid antibodies when he was brought to Bowring. The fungus had affected his left eye and he lost vision. The boy also developed abscess in the frontal lobe of the brain and was operated upon to remove the fungal debris in Nimhans in the first week of June. For the last two days, the boy was on a non-invasive ventilator and he suffered sudden cardiac arrest on Wednesday afternoon, doctors said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/at-11-ktakas-youngest-mucor-patient-dies/articleshow/84218834.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday effected sweeping changes to his government, ushering in a new set of leaders in key roles with 36 fresh faces taking oath, seven others being elevated, and as many as seven cabinet and five junior ministers getting dropped. In terms of its scope and political messaging, the reshuffle of the council of ministers effected was arguably the biggest such exercise in several years. It has brought in former CMs Narayan Rane and Sarbananda Sonowal, women leaders such as Meenakshi Lekhi, Shobha Karandlaje, Bharati Pawar and Pratima Bhowmik, politicians with strong grassroot connections and better-known faces like Jyotiraditya Scindia and Rajiv Chandrashekhar.

There was also a wild card entry, Ashwini Vaishnaw, who bagged the meaty railways, communication and IT ministries. Virender Kumar, a low-profile Dalit leader from MP, is the social justice and empowerment minister in place of Thaawarchand Gehlot. Just as significant as the inductions and elevations were the exit of senior ministers like IT and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and I&B minister Prakash Javadekar, who have been public faces of BJP and the government. Exit of health minister Harsh Vardhan, HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal and chemicals and fertilisers minister Sadanand Gowda added up to a significant recast.

The recast of the council of ministers has seen Uttar PradeshThe scope of the reshuffle can be judged by the fact that only two of the current ministers — defence minister Rajnath Singh and minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi — were in the Vajpayee ministry. Given the younger age profile of the new ministers, the PM has sought to bring a new set that will have close to three years to gain experience of office before the next Lok Sabha polls.

The age profile of the ministers showThe new nominees reflect an effort to increase the profile of OBCs in the council of ministers, with the number reaching 27 in a ministry of 78. The attempt to reduce the bias towards upper castes is clearly intended to further expand BJP’s appeal among OBCs and make it a more inclusive platform.

Health and pharma have been allocated to the same cabinet minister to bring critically needed synergy between the two wings in the middle of a raging pandemic. The new health minister, Mansukh Mandaviya, has been in the core Covid response team over the past year. He had ensured a regular flow of life-saving drugs and brings continuity and hands-on experience. The cabinet minister is complemented with a junior minister who is a tribal woman and practising doctor, and has on-ground experience in fighting malnutrition and ensuring clean water in remote areas. Education is a priority area for the government and a powerful team has been put in place to implement the PM’s grand vision of overhauling the country’s educational landscape, powered by the globally acclaimed National Education Policy. An academician and technocrat junior minister has also been placed to help roll out important initiatives. As India and the world emerge from the devastating impact of the pandemic, different ministers will work in tandem to help steer the economy out of the Covid-induced slump. It will be supported by infrastructure ministries such as the railways, aviation, highways, power, petroleum, urban development.

Other technology-driver ministries have been entrusted to professional and technocrats (MEITY, Communication). Ashwini Vaishnaw, a former IAS officer of the 1994 batch, an M Tech from IIT Kanpur as well as an MBA from Wharton, has been entrusted with the crucial information and technology ministry along with railways.

Wondering what the duration of a UAPA trial should be, the court said there should be no further delay in this case, noting that though the man has been imprisoned for 12 years, the trial is yet to be completed. When the counsel for Hakim, the accused, said there was no sight of the trial ending quickly, the prosecution opposed his plea, pointing out he Hakim had been charged with conspiracy, waging war against the state, murder and indulging in terrorist acts. It also informed the court that 276 witnesses had been examined, and before the pandemic hit, the trial court regularly heard the case. The HC adjourned the matter for July 28 when it would examine Hakim’s bail plea. Teh court had earlier directed the Tihar superintendent to escort an ailing Hakim to Safdarjung Hospital for consultation and medical advice. In his plea, the accused had sought specialist treatment for his eye along with a check-up by a general physician in view of his medical condition. The court permitted Hakim to be taken to the ophthalmologist he had consulted at the hospital, for follow-up treatment, on as many occasions as might be advised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-hc-flags-delay-in-uapa-trials-as-it-hears-man-jailed-for-12-years/articleshow/84220737.cms||---
---||India||Out: Prasad, Vardhan, Javadekar, Pokhriyal||NEW DELHI: The exit of 12 ministers came as a surprise element as well-known faces like health minister Harsh Vardhan, information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad left the government on Wednesday. The factors that led to their exit seem to range from slow pace of meeting targets to inadequate communication of policy and political goals in respective ministries. The articulation on the Covid situation was seen to be “bureaucratic” and seemed to lag in countering the opposition allegations during the second wave. It was also felt that the Delhi leader did not take on AAP on issues of oxygen shortages as was needed. Prasad, who was holding crucial departments, including law and IT, has been visible and vocal in the government's showdown with social media giant Twitter. He has also been fielded often as spokesperson on policy and political issues. The persistent problems in the telecom sector and slow progress in the Bharatnet project are seen as problematic issues. As the party organisation may also be in for recast, the possibility of former ministers finding themselves in new roles cannot be ruled out. Education minister Ramesh Pokhariyal is learnt to have had to quit largely on health grounds as he was struggling with post-Covid complications. The minister had to be hospitalised again after recovering from the infection. Though having helmed the new education policy, the leader may have been a little slow off the block in dealing with other issues relating to the ministry such as revision of school curriculum that is a major reform for the government. Sadanand Gowda’s exit is linked to multiple reasons including the ongoing strife in BJP in Karnataka as also a mediocre performance. A leader like Shobha Karandlaje, a loyalist of B S Yeddyurappa and a Vokkaliga, is a better bet for BJP. Santosh Gangwar, who was MoS with independent charge, might have lost the job for opening a front against UP CM Yogi Adityanath when the party needed to present a united face during the second wave. His record in office was not seen to be impressive either. Gangwar had written a letter to Yogi alleging mismanagement during the second wave. Leaders belonging to his Kurmi caste have been accommodated, ruling out any possibility of unhappiness in the community. The exclusions of ministers of state like Babul Supriyo, Sanjay Dhotre Shamrao and Pratap Sarangi are seen as a comment on their inability to make use of opportunities that came their way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/out-prasad-vardhan-javadekar-pokhriyal/articleshow/84220848.cms||Akhilesh Singh
---||India||Yogi tells Dhami to allow Kanwariyas into Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government is in the process of reconsidering its decision to cancel the Kanwar Yatra and allow the pilgrimage to happen, sources familiar with the development told TOI on Wednesday. This follows the announcement by the UP government on Tuesday that it would permit the yatra from July 25 onwards. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had directed officials to coordinate with neighbouring states in this regard. He subsequently dialed his Uttarakhand counterpart Pushkar Dhami. Sources told TOI that Adityanath requested Dhami that kanwarias from UP should be allowed in limited numbers to travel to Haridwar to collect water from the Ganga. A senior government official who requested anonymity said that the state government had all but made up its mind to agree to Adityanath’s appeal. “It is unlikely that the state government will turn down the request made by the UP CM. Also, assembly elections are coming up in both UP and Uttarakhand and disappointing the kanwarias, who form a chunk of the vote-base of BJP, can be counter-productive.” Speaking on the issue on Wednesday, Dhami said in Haridwar, “I have called a high-level meeting on Thursday to discuss the Kanwar Yatra. Our aim is to not disappoint the pilgrims.” When asked whether the Uttarakhand government is planning to seek advice from the Central government on the matter, Dhami said, “This is something between UP and Uttarakhand. The UP CM and I have already spoken twice on the issue and, if needed, I will speak to him again on the matter.” The Uttarakhand government had decided to cancel the Kanwar Yatra this year due to the Covid-19 threat and issued an order in this regard on June 30. Last year, too, the yatra had been cancelled due to the pandemic. In 2019, when the yatra had last taken place, over 3.3 crore kanwarias had come to Haridwar -- mainly from Haryana, UP, Delhi and Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/yogi-tells-dhami-to-allow-kanwariyas-into-uttarakhand/articleshow/84221256.cms||Gaurav Talwar

When that heart splintered, you could see every shade of sadness in those immersive eyes. Fans coined a title for him: Tragedy King. But Dilip Kumar, who passed away at 98 at a Mumbai hospital on Wednesday following "prolonged illness", was more. He could make dialogues sound like music: soft, slow and sonorous. He was the actor other actors wanted to be. He was an emperor of the box-office. And he was a rare icon of excellence in a young, independent India. Kumar's demise brings an end to the great triumvirate — Raj Kapoor and Dev Anand being the other two — who lorded over the Hindi film industry and a multitude of hearts in the 1950s and 1960s. An era is truly over. The Peshawar-born actor’s passing marks the closure of an affectionate and passionate chapter in the life of post-Independence India. As academic Meghnad Desai wrote in his book, "Nehru’s Hero", he "reflected the best of this country at the best of its times".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/a-suhana-safar-ends-for-indian-cinemas-kohinoor/articleshow/84221350.cms||Avijit Ghosh
---||India||Vaccine quota cap for private hospitals raised||MUMBAI: The Centre has revised the formula for calculating the maximum quantity of vaccines that private hospitals can procure in a month, a week after finalising it. The new plan will allow private players to buy slightly higher volumes than what was previously decided. The Centre has fixed the vaccine volumes that private hospitals can buy by introducing a ‘maximum order quantity’(MOQ) for each facility. Previously, it was decided that a hospital’s MOQ would be double the average daily consumption from one of their best performing weeks from the previous months. The limit, though, has now been increased to triple the average consumption, officials confirmed on Wednesday. The decision was communicated to private hospitals across the country through a series of online meetings on Wednesday. Central officials told the private centres that they could start placing orders through CoWin from the next few days in four instalments or at one go. Private hospitals were supposed to place vaccine orders from July 1 through CoWin, but they haven’t been able to do so. The Centre has developed two criteria for deciding the MOQ. Firstly, for hospitals that are already vaccinating since the past few months, performance from one of their best performing weeks will be taken as a benchma-rk to derive their MOQ. Secondly, for newer centres, their bed capacity will be used as a criterion. Hospitals with less than 50 beds can order up to 3,000 doses at the most, 51-300 bed hospitals can order 6,000 doses, 301-500 bed hospitals can buy up to 10,000 doses and hospitals with more than 500 beds can order 15,000 doses. It has also been clarified that the vaccine delivery could happen either from manufacturers directly or through the state or corporation delivery channel. A private hospital head told TOI if they are opting for delivery through state government or municipal corporations, a hospital can place a minimum order of 160 doses of Covaxin and 500 doses of Covishield.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vaccine-quota-cap-for-private-hospitals-raised/articleshow/84221479.cms||Sumitra Debroy

A February 2019 amendment to the Cinematograph Act, addressing issues of film piracy, was examined by the House panel in detail and a report submitted in March 2020. In April 2021, the government further amended the Cinematograph Act, to disband the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT), an appellate authority film makers approached to challenge decisions taken by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The latest change, proposed through the draft Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill, 2021, likely to be introduced in the monsoon session of Parliament, proposes to restore revisionary powers of the government to countermand decisions taken by the Central Board of Film Certification, even though this was struck down by the Supreme Court earlier. Committee members, led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, are learnt to have pointed out to the I&B ministry that film makers across the country are up in arms against the draft bill, calling it an assault on the film fraternity’s creative freedom. Panel members, sources said, also sought to know from the government why it felt the need to restore the government’s powers to overturn decisions by the Censor Board. The ministry, however, is learnt to have informed the panel that the proposed changes have been misunderstood and the board will have the power to take the final call on certifications and that the changes should not be read as the Centre censoring content. Sources said discussions on the draft Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill 2021 could not be completed on Tuesday due to the absence of I&B secretary Amit Khare. As a result, the committee is expected to meet again next week to discuss why such substantive changes have been proposed in the draft bill without taking the committee into confidence. Apart from objections raised by film makers from across the country, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin also wrote separate letters to Union IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and I&B minister Prakash Javadekar on Tuesday, demanding the withdrawal of the draft bill and calling the proposed amendment “against the spirit of promoting rightful thinking in civil society.” Stalin raised the issue after Tamil Nadu’s film industry urged him to flag the matter with the Centre. “I wish to reiterate that the draft amendment restoring the 'revisional power' to the Centre after it is certified by the CBFC is a misuse of 'reasonable restriction' clause under Article 19(2) of the Constitution of India….and this draft amendment itself is against the spirit of promoting rightful thinking in civil society,” Stalin said in his letter||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-piecemeal-filmmaking-bill-ib-min-asked/articleshow/84221601.cms||Swati Mathur

The House panel had on June 29 asked Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, how they could trace the origins of a message if content was end-to-end encrypted. In response, Facebook India’s policy director Shivnath Thukral and general counsel Namrata Singh had said that it would not be possible to break end-to-end encryption for India alone as this would have ramifications for users across the globe. Thukral also said they would explain to the panel, in writing, the difference between WhatsApp watermarking messages as “forwarded many times”, and identifying where a message originated. Since the written response was not received until Tuesday, the Secretariat, sources said, would send a reminder to Facebook.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/can-origin-of-messages-be-found-facebook-asked/articleshow/84221621.cms||Swati Mathur

To this, the court replied: “India is a democratic country ruled by law, not by shastras.” The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma asked AG SN Babulkar to not get into religious arguments as they have no legal backing. “If there is a bar in the IT Act then please show me those provisions of the Act which say no livestreaming can be permitted from the temple,” the chief justice said. The AG had submitted that a decision on allowing livestreaming would be taken by the Devasthanam board — which manages temples in the state — but added that according to some priests Hindu shastras do not permit livestreaming of rituals. The court reacted sharply and said: “…Shastras do not control this country, what controls this country and guides us for our future is the Constitution of India and that’s where we stop. We cannot go beyond the Constitution and the laws thereunder… We are a democratic country ruled by rule of law.

A day after chief minister Amarinder Singh discussed the deadlock with party chief Sonia Gandhi and said he will implement whatever is decided by her, it is learnt the party engaged in some last-minute negotiations to seal the deal that is to be announced “in three days”. A senior leader involved in Punjab resolution is learnt to have Wednesday contacted the state colleagues to discuss the reorganisation as did the key troubleshooters of the leadership. Punjab Congress circles claimed that in his meeting with Sonia Gandhi, chief minister Amarinder Singh again reiterated his strong opposition to Sidhu being given the state party leadership. The buzz was that he cited serious consequences of such a step. Well-placed sources said Sidhu has been adamant about the post of state president and no amount of reasoning could shake him from his desire. He met Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi last week. Priyanka is said to be backing Sidhu strongly, along with the feedback that he has the public sentiment with him. However, on Wednesday, Congress was hopeful as it hung on to the words it attributed to Sidhu. “He has told us that he will abide by the decision of the party and the Congress president,” a key manager told TOI. While the opposition to his leadership was pointed out to Sidhu and he was offered the post of chairman of the campaign committee, along with inclusion in CEC or the post of deputy CM, sources said he was reluctant to back down. Complicating Sidhu’s push is CM Singh’s card that a Hindu leader should become the state president for political balancing. He has his minister Vijay Inder Singla or Manish Tewari in mind. In that scenario, the alternative option suggested by Sidhu is to have three “working presidents” from different communities, with Sidhu as the president. If Sidhu does not accept the campaign position and the party brass backs CM Singh’s veto against making him the PCC chief, a manager wondered if Sidhu may prefer to show himself “above posts” to boost his credibility and position himself for post-poll or post-Amarinder scenario. The party is also looking to have deputy chief ministers along with Amarinder Singh. There are serious misgivings in the party about handing the charge of the state unit to Sidhu. Seeing him as unpredictable who can clash with Amarinder Singh midway through the campaign, a key Punjab Congress leader who is also close to Rahul Gandhi, said the move can backfire on the party. “We have to run the campaign for the next six months. With Sidhu as in-charge, we cannot predict if it can be smooth,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sidhu-sticks-to-guns-but-congress-stays-hopeful-of-punjab-peace/articleshow/84221674.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||India||HC judge recuses self, fines Didi 5 lakh||KOLKATA: Calcutta high court judge Kausik Chanda on Wednesday recused himself from hearing Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s petition on BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari’s Nandigram poll victory but also fined her Rs 5 lakh to “firmly repulse” the “calculated psychological offensives and vilification adopted to seek recusal”. Banerjee had alleged in her petition that Justice Chanda’s long association with the BJP’s legal cell and taking up cases for the party posed an “apprehension of bias” and that “the court should be like Caesar’s wife, above suspicion”. Justice Chanda said he had “no personal inclination to hear out the case” nor did he have any “hesitation in taking up the case” but he still chose to recuse because “the two persons involved in this case belong to the highest echelons of state politics”. “Some opportunists have already emerged... in the name of saving the judiciary. These trouble-mongers will try to keep the controversy alive and create newer controversies. The trial of the case before this bench will be a tool to aggrandise themselves. It would be contrary to the interest of justice if such unwarranted squabble continues along with the trial,” the judge said. The fine of Rs 5 lakh should be paid to the Bar Council of West Bengal to help families of advocates who lost their lives to Covid, he ordered. Banerjee did not respond to media’s questions on the fine. “This is a subjudice matter. I will not speak on this. The lawyers will take a decision,” she said. But other Trinamool leaders as well as the BJP’s IT Cell chief took to Twitter after the order. Trinamool Rajya Sabha leader and spokesperson Derek O’Brien, without directly referring to the judgement, tweeted: “We live and learn. We live in a world where the cost of speaking the truth now comes with a staggering price tag: Rs 5 lakh. We live in a world where propaganda and falsehood are also meted out. The price: FREE. Got the reference? Modi hai to mumkin Hai. Go figure.” Trinamool Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra, whose tweet listing the cases Justice Chanda had appeared for the BJP as a lawyer was mentioned in Justice Chanda’s order, tweeted: “Petulance at its best today. Realising no way out but to recuse himself he decides to slap Rs 5 lakh fine simply because he can.

---||India||Don’t divide terror into categories: India at UN||NEW DELHI: Calling for collective efforts by UN member states to check terrorism, India warned against attempts to again divide the menace into different categories and erase the gains made in the past two decades. Participating in the UN general assembly debate on adoption of resolution on 7th Review of Global Counter Terrorism Strategy (GCTS) on Tuesday, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, T S Tirumurti, said the international community has acknowledged that the threat of terrorism is grave and universal, and can only be defeated by collective efforts of all UN member states, without any exception. “It is only after 9/11 that we accepted that terrorism in one part of the world can directly impact another part of the world and we all came together to fight terrorism collectively,” he said. The envoy said the international community should not forget that before the 9/11 terror attacks, the world was divided into “your terrorists” or “my terrorists”. Two decades later, “we are now seeing attempts to divide us once again” by adopting new terminologies under the guise of “emerging threats” such as racially and ethnically-motivated violent extremism, violent nationalism, right wing extremism, he said. “I do hope that member states do not forget history and divide terrorism again into different categories and take us back to the era of “your terrorists’’ and “my terrorists’’ and erase the gains we have had over the last two decades.” He noted the absence of a universally agreed definition of terrorism is “detrimental to our shared goal” of eliminating the global scourge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dont-divide-terror-into-categories-india-at-un/articleshow/84221708.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: ‘Middle-income home buyers to benefit’||KOLKATA: Home buyers keen on purchasing apartments in Dum Dum and B T Road localities will save 3%-5% if they make a purchase within three months and register the property by October 30 following the state budget announcement on Wednesday. That translates into a saving of nearly Rs 1.25 lakh on an apartment that costs Rs 50 lakh. This could be a boon for home buyers in the middle -income group. Experts also feel the budget will give a push to completing pending registrations. The real estate industry has welcomed the budget proposal of 2% reduction in stamp duty and 10% reduction in peak circle rate and believe it will give a fillip to the real estate in Kolkata and rest of the state for a limited period. At present, the stamp duty is 6% for apartments that cost less than Rs 1 crore and 7% for those priced Rs 1 crore and above. “This will particularly help home buyers in the middle income segment and reduce their financial burden due to uncertainty created by the pandemic,” said Siddha group MD Sanjay Jain. While the reduction in registration fee will lead to savings across the board, revision in circle rate will impact localities where the actual transaction value is less than the circle rate. In such cases, buyers and sellers have to pay income tax on the difference, which is viewed as deemed income. This will have an impact on areas, like Dum Dum and BT Road, where the circle rate is higher than the actual rate. The difference between the transaction and circle rates is more stark in the commercial rates, in Salt Lake Sector V. Real estate consultants N K Realtors and Pioneer Properties that market most of the projects in Kolkata, said the proposals could lead to 20%-25% increase in sales. “Prospective home buyers who were hesitant about making a purchase will now seal the deals,” said Jitendra Khaitan of Pioneer Properties. Biplab Kumar of N K Realtors said pending registrations would be quickly completed to take advantage of the offer. Ketan Sengupta, CEO of Bengal Peerless Housing Development Co, too, felt the move would lead to registrations over the next three months, bringing in revenue for the government. Sushil Mohta, president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (Credai), Bengal, said the real estate community was delighted that the state government had considered a long-standing demand. “We welcome the move whole heartedly and hope it would help boost demand in the sector amid the pandemic. Reduction in the rate of stamp duty should help end-users and boost sales. This will also bring more revenue,” he said. Nandu Belani, who heads Credai-Bengal, the apex body for developers in Kolkata, said the average home buyer in Kolkata would save at least Rs 1 lakh in stamp duty, following the budget. “The circle rate correction will primarily help commercial projects, particularly warehouses along the two national highways outside Kolkata,” he said. Shristi Infrastructure chief marketing officer Abhishek Bharadwaj said the offers would act as a catalyst for the industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/middle-income-home-buyers-to-benefit/articleshow/84218124.cms||Subhro Niyogi

After inspecting the spot, SP Ballia Vipin Tada said, “Balbir’s family has not given any complaint in this connection so far. However, during initial investigation it has come to light that he had a criminal history-sheet with the police and had also gone to jail in a murder case.” “Currently, he was involved in property dealing. Police are investigating all aspects, including Balbir’s old enmities and trade rivalries for cracking the case,” he added. “Balbir, a native of Bairiya, and Amritesh were returning home from Sonbarsa village in a SUV. When they were passing on national highway-31 between Brahmamod and Chiraiyyamod, two motorcycle-borne miscreants intercepted their SUV and opened indiscriminate fire targeting Balbir, who was in the driving seat,” said Tada. On seeing the miscreants targeting Balbir, Amritesh stepped down from the SUV to save him and in this bid he suffered minor leg injury. Before the locals could reach the spot, the shooters fled the scene. Local natives and police rushed Balbir and Amritesh to a hospital in Sonbarsa area where doctors declared him dead. During initial investigation, it came to light that Balbir had been booked in murder, attempt to murder and other criminal cases in the past. He had also been sent to jail. No new criminal case had been lodged against him in recent years and he had become involved in real estate trade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/former-member-of-zila-panchayat-shot-in-ballia/articleshow/84214353.cms||---

In those days, car owners mostly opted for filling up the tank or get at least five to 10 litres at a go. Seldom would I find anyone buying just a litre. Before I joined, our station had hand-crank dispensers. I initially used the clock meter pump, followed by metal wheels with an analogue reading meter. In the 1990s, came Z-line pumps and digital display, showing the quantity in litres, value and rate. In the 2000s, the system chan-ged to automated service with multiple nozzles attached to dispensers. The introduction of cheaper cars and two-wheelers had increased fuel sale, but this trend of rising prices will hamper buying habits in future. Saha, 55, a fuel station attendant at a north Kolkata pump, has been in service since 1985.

Thankfully, there was no casualty or injuries to anyone as the stretch was deserted at the time. The brakes of the lorry, coming from Anandapuram area, reportedly malfunctioned on the steep slope, leading the vehicle to ram the divider at a fair speed. “The driver seems to have deliberately tried to hit the divider to stop the vehicle when he realised the brakes had failed. The driver escaped unhurt. Thankfully, the mishap happened in the early hours and the stretch was deserted. Had it happened during day time when the area is crowded with walkers and vehicles, it could have led to loss of precious lives,” said A Adinarayana, additional DCP (traffic). It may be recalled that two people died and three others injured when a private school bus lost control and hit people sitting on the parapet wall at the same place on April 30, 2017. In February 2019, a sand-laden lorry also crashed at the same spot, though no casualties or injuries were reported. The steep slope at the particular stretch is considered a black spot and many accidents have been reported here. “After the 2017 accident, we took several safety measures and closed the junction. We have also put up speed breakers, set up a traffic signal there. Traffic cops are also posted there from 6 am to 10 pm,” Adinarayana said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/lorry-turns-turtle-on-beach-road-black-spot-none-hurt/articleshow/84213801.cms||Siva G

Seven of them will be operational by the end of July, according to the officials of the Board. Two such stations will come up in Bhagalpur, whereas one each in Valmiki Nagar, Siwan, Chappra, Buxar, Ara, Sasaram, Motihari, Aurangabad, Rajgir, Biharsharif, Begusarai, Samastipur, Darbhanga, Munger, Saharsa, Katihar, Purnia, Araria and Kishanganj. The number of air monitoring stations would go up in Gaya and Muzaffarpur to three as the board has been setting up one more station in each city. At present, air monitoring stations are in four cities, including six in Patna, two each in Muzaffarpur and Gaya and one at Hajipur. The CAAQMS shows real-time air quality status based on the air pollution index (API) computed on various parameters, including PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 micron), PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 micron), carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulphur dioxide, Benzene, Toluene and Xylene (BTX) and others. BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh, said five new stations would be enabled with black carbon sensor and were being installed at Gaya, Muzaffarpur, Sasaram, Darbhanga and Valmiki Nagar. “In all 24 cities, the area has been specified and installation work has started. Eight of them will be operational by July-end,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-to-get-24-new-air-monitoring-stations-soon/articleshow/84215347.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Vijayawada||Notification on clinical pharmacist posts draws praise||AMARAVATI: In what could be considered a game-changer move in healthcare management in the country, the Centre has cleared decks for appointment of clinical pharmacists in hospitals to take care of drug administration of patients. This is significant in the wake of widespread complaints about drug mismanagement during Covid-19 where prescription of high doses of steroids and antibiotics resulted in new health disorders among victims. Now, the Union government has brought an amendment to the Pharmacy Act, 1948, and Pharmacy Practice Regulations, 2015, to incorporate a ‘Clinical Pharmacist and Drug Information Pharmacist’ position. This would help graduates of Pharm-D courses to exclusively handle drug administration in hospitals. Doctor of Pharmacy Association (DPA) welcomed the move of Pharmacy Council of India and the ministry of health and family welfare. “This is the first step for ensuring that clinical pharmacists get a place in hospitals. We are now going to work with the central and state governments to get it implemented in all hospitals,” Dr Sai Kumar Katam, national president of DPA. He added that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended having a clinical pharmacist in every hospital as per the patient ratio, in order to provide cost effective and safe treatment to patients. Considered as an important cog in the wheel of the healthcare delivery mechanism, unlike developed countries, the role of clinical pharmacists is less defined in India. The new regulations will add a new dimension to clinical pharmacy practice which has so far remained in the background. Pharmacists will now be able to support patients in the use of medicines besides taking part in clinical decision-making. “India accounts for 5.2 million injuries annually with medication errors and adverse drug reactions. The need of the hour is to detect and manage adverse drug reactions, assist physicians in individualising the drug dosage regimen,” said Dr Sai Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/notification-on-clinical-pharmacist-posts-draws-praise/articleshow/84215156.cms||Samdani MN
---||Patna||‘Learn a lesson from second wave, adopt Cov-appropriate behaviour’||PATNA: With the government easing the Covid-induced lockdown, a large number of Patnaites can now be seen flouting the safety protocols and throwing caution to the wind. They do not wear masks and openly violate social distancing norms at public places. This, in turn, has made health experts raise concern over a possible resurgence of fresh corona cases due to the people’s carelessness. Dr A A Hai, a surgeon, says people’s “inappropriate behaviour” will definitely invite the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Even if they are vaccinated, they should adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour, instead of moving around carelessly,” he adds. The former president of the Indian Medical Association-Bihar, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, warns that Bihar is sitting on top of an active volcano that can burst anytime because of the possibility of a third wave. “The government should raise more awareness about the Covid safety protocols. Police, on the other hand, should penalise and take stringent action against the people, who flout the norms,” he advises. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, also points out, “If people become complacent, fail to follow social distancing norms and throw away their masks, there are chances that the third wave of the pandemic will arrive soon.” Calling Covid-inappropriate behaviour a threat, Dr Varsha Singh, an epidemiologist at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, asks people to “learn a lesson from the second wave of the pandemic that had wreaked havoc on Bihar and claimed numerous lives”. “The government and the district administration should ensure that Covid safety protocols are not violated,” she adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/learn-a-lesson-from-second-wave-adopt-cov-appropriate-behaviour/articleshow/84213016.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Split in LJP facilitates rise of Paras to Union ministry||PATNA: LJP MP from Hajipur Pashupati Kumar Paras was finally rewarded with a ministerial berth in the Narendra Modi Cabinet on Wednesday, more than three weeks after a coup in the party founded by his elder brother and former Union minister late Ram Vilas Paswan. A seven-term MLA and one term MLC, the 68-year-old Paras had also served as a minister in the Nitish Kumar government when the LJP was part of the NDA government in the state in 2017. A BEd degree holder from erstwhile Bhagalpur University, Paras has spent over 45 years in public life. Born at Saharbanni under Alouli block in Khagaria district, Paras remained a trusted lieutenant of his elder brother till he was alive. LJP fielded him from Hajipur in the 2019 Lok Sabha election on the recommendation of Ram Vilas whom he called 'saheb'. On June 13, Paras along with four party MPs, staged a coup against Ram Vilas’s son and party chief Chirag Paswan, who was also the LJP parliamentary party leader in the LoK Sabha and an aspirant to become a Union minister in place of his father after his death. But his opposition to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar cost him dearly and paved way for Paras to get a Cabinet berth in the Union ministry. Earlier, The Lok Sabha Speaker recognised him as the LJP parliamentary party leader in the Upper House. Later Paras was also anointed as the president of the breakaway faction of LJP, which he claims to be the real one, and removed Chirag from the post of party’s national president. Paras made his debut in politics in 1978 as the Janata Party candidate from Alouli assembly seat, which was formerly represented by Ram Vilas. He represented the seat in the state legislative assembly seven times, both as a member of the Janata party and the LJP. He nourished his political aspirations under the shadow of Ram Vilas, who preferred to field him from Hajipur Lok Sabha constituency which he had himself represented for decades. This showed a bondage between the two brothers. However, Chirag's nomination as national president of the party made Paras angry, but he could not muster courage then to revolt against his mentor Ram Vilas. The tug of war between 'chacha' and 'bhatija' still continues. Chirag moves court: Jamui MP Chirag Paswan filed a petition in the Delhi high court on Wednesday against the Lok Sabha Speaker’s Speaker’s decision to recognise “expelled” MP Paras as the LJP leader of the House. Earlier, Chirag strongly opposed the induction of Paras in the Union Cabinet on Wednesday. In a statement, Chirag said the PM has the right to include anyone in his team, but as far as LJP is concerned, Paras is not a member of the party, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/split-in-ljp-facilitates-rise-of-paras-to-union-ministry/articleshow/84215404.cms||Ramashankar

Sample this: Car maker Hyundai has achieved full capacity, after restart of its factories in Sriperumbudur. “We have been running three shifts for one month and we have hit 100% production utilisation right now. As various states open up, our production is on target,” said Ganesh Mani, director- production, Hyundai Motor India. “Right now 27% of our production is meant for exports and 73% for the domestic market,” said Mani. Hyundai’s current capacity is enough for the “next couple of years” , he added. The company will also ‘augment’ its workforce closer to the festival season. “At this moment we have 14,000 people (including temporary workers) but the numbers change according to the market requirement as well as the model being pro- duced,” he said. Sanitaryware maker Roca Parryware will end July with its highest ever monthly sales. “Our sales will be record breaking in July. The demand has been very strong for JohnsonPedder range (which is in the budget segment) and Parryware (premium segment), as push for housing gains momentum,” said Roca Parryware’s MD KE Ranganathan. The customer’s have changed their buying styles. “Earlier they spent around three hours on average for a purchase, now it’s just 30 to 45 mins as they come with specific requirements and purchase and go,” he added. This has resulted in order book swelling. “We normally maintain a 15 days order book, but now its two months and at the current demand we have to increase capacities across facilities and look for a new green field plant for future growth,” he added. With more shoppers getting out, demand for personal care products are also rising. FMCG company CavinKare is witnessing strong demand. “With the reopening of markets, we are witnessing a strong demand for the personal care segment, while salon and diary is still to gain traction. Our assessment is that skin care will witness growth here as people have started to venture out for their work and that will push the demand in that segment,” said its CMD CK Ranganathan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/companies-hit-peak-button-in-july-on-easing-restrictions/articleshow/84217300.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

The team will also engage volunteers to work for the river in protecting it from pollution and rejuvenating its banks via community participation. Acting as per the directives of the Union Jal Shakti ministry, AU authorities have formed a special committee under Prof IR Siddiqui of the department of chemistry for this purpose. The panel will have four members, including two female teachers. It will keep a tab on the Ganga and its banks besides undertaking an extensive survey of the riverbanks to identify potential dangers. As part of a new initiative of this Central varsity, the aim of the team will be to protect the national river and help plug major sources of pollution endangering it. The VC has issued orders in this regard. The committee will work in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur. Ganga is not just a river for us but a flow of civilization and culture and our national identity. Efforts should be made to make Ganga pollution free and ensure the continuity of its stream. For this, we would monitor the river, survey all the villages besides its course, geotag the drains falling in the river and most importantly rope in the communities living on its banks for protecting the river,” said head of the department of geography Prof AR Siddiqui. “Community support, including that of students and teachers of colleges and schools located in the villages along the river, would be sought as routine life of the villagers revolves around the river and once they are made aware about the need of preserving the river, half the battle is won,” he added. “Support of NCC cadets and volunteers of NSS would be taken in activating village folks, students, women and gram panchayats,” he further said. The five-member committee, constituted by AU registrar Prof NK Shukla, includes Prof IR Siddiqui (chairman), Prof AR Siddiqui, Manoj Singh of material science department, Priya Kesari of the department of family and community science and Richa Mishra of the JK Institute. Prof AR Siddiqui further said that a survey will be conducted along the Ganga, in the stretch of Kaushambi and Prayagraj, to identify and check the polluting spots. Along with this, community outreach programmes would be organised so that a massive campaign for protecting the river could be initiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/au-teachers-to-protect-ganga-from-degradation/articleshow/84214608.cms||Rajeev Mani

Altogether 15 railway employees at Jamalpur workshop have died in the second wave of Covid-19. While doctors and paramedical staff are being appointed at the railway hospital on Bhagalpur railway station premises, machines and gadgets for microbiological tests and health check-ups are being installed at other railway hospitals. The ER has installed ‘mini vidas machine’, a compact automated immunoassay system based on the enzyme linked fluorescent assay (ELFA) principles, at the divisional railway hospital at Asansol. The machine will also be installed at other hospitals soon. Ekalabya Chakraborty, ER chief public relations officer, said the healthcare facilities are being augmented at railway hospitals as part of the preparations for any third wave of the Covid-19. “ELFA based mini vidas machines can help manage Covid and non-Covid cases better through its methodology of pathological prognostic testing with ease,” he said. He added: “Apart from the Covid-19 pandemic prognostic marker like D-dimer, Procalcitonin, ferritin, the mini vidas machine will be used for thyroid testing, vitamin-D, PSA estimation for the railway employees and its beneficiaries. All such pathological tests were earlier done with in tie-up facilities, but now can be done at the railway hospitals.” He claimed that in case of emergency, the mini vidas machine will be of extreme importance as it is convenient and user-friendly and provides accurate on-demand test results in less time. “We are also reviewing healthcare arrangements at all the railway hospitals under ER,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/er-augments-healthcare-infra-at-railway-hospitals/articleshow/84213153.cms||---

The chief minister will dedicate several agri institutions during his visit to Anantapur district. He will participate in a Rythu Dinotsavam programme at Rayadurgam agriculture market yard before addressing the public meeting in the town. Jagan is holding a mass contact programme after almost six months as he suspended several scheduled visits in view of public safety during the second wave of Covid-19. The chief minister had cancelled his public meeting in Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency by-election in April. The chief minister had recently visited Gollapudi where he interacted with a select group of women while taking part in a Disha mobile application awareness programme. The chief minister has now decided to resume his district tours with YSR birth anniversary celebrations. The government has made elaborate arrangements to dedicate several institutions including agri laboratories, Rythu Bharosa Kendras and aqua labs. As many as 1,898 RBKs constructed at a cost of Rs 413.76 crore will be simultaneously inaugurated in all mandals on Thursday. The government granted 10,408 RBKs in the state, of which 1,898 are ready for opening. The agriculture department directed district joint collectors to ready inauguration plaques in such a way that all installations are opened by the chief minister.

Under Sebi rules, the stock will be listed before the end of the current month, most likely by July 27, market sources said. The shares of the company are being offered at a price band of Rs 72-76 each, BSE disclosures showed. The app-based food delivery major, in which listed technology company Info Edge holds a substantial stake, aims to raise about Rs 9,375 crore. Of the total issue size, shares worth about Rs 375 crore are in an offer for sale by the tech entity. On July 2, Zomato received markets regulator Sebi’s nod to launch its IPO. After the listing, the company is eyeing a valuation in the range of $8-10 billion, or about Rs 60,000-75,000 crore, market sources said. Funds raised by issuing new shares would be used for financing Zomato’s organic and inorganic growth initiatives, and general corporate purposes, the draft papers for IPO had noted. In the last few days, on the back of strong demand for its shares from large institutional investors, the company has upped the IPO size from about Rs 7,500 crore that was planned earlier. At the same time, InfoEdge has also halved the size of its offer for sale from Rs 750 crore earlier. During fiscal 2020, Zomato’s revenues had jumped over twofold to $394 million (around Rs 2,960 crore) compared to its year-ago period, while its ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) loss was around Rs 2,200 crore. Kotak Mahindra Capital Co, Morgan Stanley India, Credit Suisse, BofA Securities India and Citigroup Global Markets India are managing the offering. The shares of the company will be listed on the BSE as well as the NSE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zomato-ipo-to-open-on-july-14-list-by-month-end/articleshow/84217834.cms||---

A drone was used to attack Jammu Air Force Base on June 27. Incidentally, the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) had arrested three persons with eight Chinese drones during vehicle checking at Kunba Chainpur near Motihari on India-Nepal border the same evening. That had created a flutter as Bihar has a civilian airport at Patna and Gaya and a civil enclave at Darbhanga Air Force station. Besides, there are Air Force stations at Bihta and Purnia, too. Union ministry of home affairs has standard operating procedure (SOP) for preventing drone attack on crucial installations and Bureau of Civil Aviation security has issued a circular on counter-drone technology for surveillance, detection and their neutralisation. Sources said a high-level meeting took place between state government authorities and other central agencies soon after the Jammu attack to discuss the safeguard measures to counter drones. A senior officer of civil aviation ministry, preferring anonymity, said drones are mainly chased by security personnel and shot down in ‘hard-kill’ methodology and it’s in the MHA SOP, too. “As far as my knowledge says, there is no soft-kill methodology available in civilian sector yet in the country to counter an unwanted flying drone. Such methodology includes jamming radio frequency on which it is being controlled or frying internal circuitry using high-power laser beam. Such technologies are very costly. The armed forces may have such but there is no knowledge about them in public domain,” he said. He said after the Jammu attack, CISF personnel guarding airports have been briefed and alerted about drones and related SOP which includes keeping an eye, reporting any drone being spotted, tracking physically by maintaining visuals and shoot it down when required. The officer said a common man needs to follow DGCA norms and seek permission for purchasing and flying a drone. When asked, Patna airport director BCH Negi on Wednesday said that it was decided to follow the SOP in case of drone spotting. “In future, all airports in the country will have no-drone zone. An unauthorised drone is not visible on ATC radar,” he said. Negi said the state government officers, including from the police headquarters, CISF, airport authorities were present in the meeting. Patna frontier SSB IG Pankaj Kumar Darad said paramilitary personnel guarding the India-Nepal border have been sensitized after the Jammu incident. “SSB always keeps an eye on all types of cross-border smuggling, including drones. Alertness has been increased now. They have been asked to maintain visual alertness in sky too. We also report about any aircraft crossing the international border,” he added. Darad said drones seized in Motihari had very less payload capacity. “They were to be used for photography in parties and marriages,” he said. State police headquarters had also issued statement on the Motihari incident that the seized drones were meant for use in parties, but detailed investigation was going on in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/unauthorised-drone-not-visible-on-any-atc-radar/articleshow/84215014.cms||Debashish Karmakar

According to sources, around 11 crore metres of dress materials or fabrics will be needed for schoolchildren across the state. The two sets of uniforms will be given to all the students in state government-run schools under the Mukhyamantri Poshak Yojana (MPY). The directorate of handloom and sericulture and silk under the department of industries recently confirmed about it through a letter addressed to Alim Ansari, secretary of Resham Bunkar Khadi Evam Gramodyog Sangh at Nathnagar. Ansari had made an appeal to CM Nitish Kumar, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, industries minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain and principal secretaries of departments concerned to consider procurement of Bhagalpur handloom fabrics for school uniforms under MPY in order to help out the weavers, who are under abject penury for more than 18 months due to Covid pandemic. “Nitish took up the matter and gave directives to departments concerned. The step taken by the CM will go a long way in saving the silk and handloom industry of Bhagalpur and stop migration of weavers,” Ansari said. Weavers here said local silk industry was badly affected by Covid pandemic and subsequent lockdowns. Livelihood of thousands of weavers and their families (estimated to be more than 10,000) was affected in Champanagra and Nathnagar localities. Handloom products such as tussar silk, cotton and linen are manufactured here and sent to different parts of the country and abroad as well. However, sources said produce worth several hundred crores of rupees is dumped here due to the lockdown. “The question of survival of the members of the weaving community and their families has risen due to closure of local markets and non-supply of products to exporters. Non-payments had also resulted in starvation-like situation. Therefore, we made an appeal to CM to requisition locally made fabrics for school uniforms under MPY,” Ansari said. Welcoming the step, general secretary of Eastern Bihar Industries Association Alok Agarwal said the move would be a boost for the state government’s vision to provide employment to locals at their places and check unnecessary migration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/weavers-fabric-to-be-used-for-making-uniforms/articleshow/84213487.cms||Kumar Rajesh

Sources said the meeting was held in two sessions. In the morning, Rahul talked to nearly ten senior leaders, including Meira Kumar, Nikhil Kumar, Shakil Ahmad, Bihar president Madan Mohan Jha and former president Anil Sharma for two hours. Later, in the evening, he met all the legislators along with the senior leaders for two hours. Jha told TOI over the phone that it was the first meeting after assembly election in Bihar last year. “This meeting was really fruitful and all the legislators have requested to hold such meetings every three months. In fact, Rahul Ji has agreed to it. Now our focus is to expand our party in Bihar,” said Jha. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said the discussion was about strengthening the party in Bihar. “Everything was very positive and we were very happy after meeting Rahul ji” said Mishra. However, another senior leader added, “No one knows what people have discussed in one-on-one meetings. There are possibilities that issues related to state president and change in BPCC had been raised.” Sources said all the MLAs and MLCs were present in the meeting, except for two — Kadwa MLA Shakil Ahmad Khan could not attend it for some personal engagements and Manihari MLA Manohar Prasad Singh could not attend it because of health issues. Protest against price hikes: State Congress members and Patna mahanagar unit of Youth Congress on Wednesday staged protests against the hike in fuel and coking gas prices besides inflation. Carrying cylinders on their heads, they raised slogans against the NDA government at the Centre as well as in the state. This was part of their seven-day protest launched in the state from Wednesday. Youth Congress president Gunjan Patel said through such protests they want to awaken the government which is in slumber and does not care about the common man. “Today, we had planned to walk from Kargil Chowk to JP Roundabout, but we were not allowed citing the Epidemic Act. This government is trying to suppress the voices being raised against it,” said Gunjan, adding they will also be taking out a cycle march in rural parts of Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rahul-meets-bihar-congress-legislators-leaders/articleshow/84215154.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Business||At 61%, IL&FS recovery may beat IBC’s 39%||MUMBAI: The estimated recovery from the IL&FS resolution process at around 61% of overall group debt is better than the average 39% recovery by lenders under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) process. According to C S Rajan, MD of IL&FS, the company has managed this through a combination of court-approved sales and settlements. Given that there is no legislative or regulatory regime to deal with group insolvency, the board adopted a multipronged approach — depending on the type of asset — by focusing on resolution, restructuring and recovery. In its April 2021 update, the new board enhanced its estimates of aggregate debt recovery to Rs 61,000 crore. This was an increase of Rs 5,000 crore over previous estimates, and represented a resolution of over 61% of (overall fund-based and non-fund based) group debt of approximately Rs 99,000 crore, as of October 2018. This includes the debt addressed through resolution, restructuring and liquidation across 347 IL&FS companies. As of end-March 2021, of the 347 entities, 186 have been resolved with Rs 43,000 crore of debt addressed. The quarterly newsletter of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India for March 2021 reveals that recovery through resolution amounted to about 39%. And recovery through liquidation is around 4%. According to bankers, recovery in the IBC process has had extreme outcomes. There have been cases like Essar Steel and Bhushan Steel where the lenders got all their money back, and others like Videocon and Jet Airways, which were pretty close to liquidation value. What the IBC data does not show is the one-time settlement cases that are happening outside the insolvency process. In many of these cases, the promoters know that they can lose everything should their company go into bankruptcy, which is prompting them to come forward for a settlement. The IL&FS board had the advantage of all options, and they were not pushed into a ‘sale or liquidation’ situation. For instance, in the case of road projects, where conventional investors were spoilt for choice given the road projects on sale, the board decided to go for the alternative option of setting up an infrastructure investment trust (InvIT). According to Rajan, the resolution framework — approved by the National Company Law Tribunal — has been devised to optimise recovery for various classes of creditors, including for those at the holding company levels, where most of the total group debt lies. Industry sources say that while the new board has addressed a major chunk of the debt, the challenge is resolving IL&FS Financial Services and the remaining cases of dozens of companies where the amounts involved are relatively small. In the case of I-FIN, the board is understood to have dropped the plan to sell Rs 5,000 crore worth of loans after bids came in the range of 5%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/at-61-ilfs-recovery-may-beat-ibcs-39/articleshow/84217781.cms||---

The devotees are majorly dependent on the local vendors for making arrangements for accommodation, food, and puja items,” Vitthal wrote in the letter and sought the CM’s approval to organise the fair as “the condition of Bihar is better than other states so far as the vaccination drive is concerned”. Although the Pitrapaksha month will begin on September 19, preparations for the fair have not yet started. In the letter, the VTMC’s acting president has mentioned eight points for organising a “safe mela”. These include mandatory Covid test, screening of all devotees, use of sanitizers, vaccination at health camps, regular sanitization of vehicles, and maintenance of physical distancing. “More than 5,000 people, including Gayapal pandas, priests performing ‘karmakand’, and vendors selling puja items, have been struggling to make ends meet as the Vishnupad Temple is shut. While other businesses are reopening gradually, temples are still closed,” Vitthal rued. A member of the Gayapal Panda Samaj, Mahesh Guput, claimed, “People from Gujarat, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and other states are asking us when they can come to Gaya for performing the ‘pind daan’ rituals.” He added, “Before Covid hit the country, the Gayapal pandas or their representatives would visit other states and explain the importance of ‘pind daan’ to the people. The ritual is believed to bring peace and prosperity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/organise-pitrapaksha-mela-this-year-vtmc-president-urges-cm/articleshow/84213248.cms||---

RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari said while the problem was with the engine, compartments were being changed. RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav, who a day before was ill, seemed to be politically active on Wednesday. Tej trained his guns on the JD(U) and Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi. “Sending RCP Singh to Modi Cabinet proves that JD(U) is a party of a particular caste (Kurmi),” he tweeted. In another tweet, he taunted SuMo for not getting space in the new Cabinet. “New kurta-pyjama which chota Modi had got stitched should be kept ready. You will use it for Tejashwi’s oath-taking ceremony and one seat will be reserved for you in the visitor’s gallery.” State Congress spokesperson Rajesh Rathhore said this reshuffle has shown the real status of CM Nitish Kumar, who had to compromise with only one seat. “Earlier, when JD(U) was being given one Cabinet berth, Nitish had not agreed. Now the same Nitish has bowed down and accepted one seat. PM Modi has shown Nitish his real stature,” said Rathhore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/opposition-takes-jibe-at-jdu-bjp/articleshow/84215223.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 92-yr-old petrol pump tracks rising graph of fuel price||KOLKATA: One of the oldest fuel stations in India, and possibly the first kerbside refuelling facilities in Kolkata, Jatadhari Daw & Grandsons on CR Avenue near Girish Park has witnessed the rise and rise of petrol and diesel prices like no other place in the city. “My great grandfather had opened a fuel station when the concept of petrol pumps had not even arrived in this part of India. We were also the first ones to start a kerbside petrol pump and continue to function from the same spot. I can’t say what the fuel price was when my ancestor started this fuel station in 1929, but back in 1965, when I was around 10 years old, I remember petrol was priced at 90 paise per litre. For a gallon, or 5 litres, of petrol, we used to hand out a change of 50 paise when somebody paid with a Rs 5 note,” said Kanchan Daw, the current proprietor of the fuel station named after his grandfather. At present, Daw’s family owns three fuel stations in Kolkata — one on JM Avenue and one at Gariahat, apart from the pump on CR Avenue, which is the oldest of the lot. Daw said his family owned a zamindari in Budge Budge where they had set up an oil storage and used to store imported gasoline brought along the sea from the UK. The importers were then called Asiatic Petroleum. “Back in the 1920s, our family used to sell petrol from an establishment on Canning Street. During the petroleum revolution in India, following Asiatic Petroleum (India) joining hands with the Burmah Oil Co to form the Burmah-Shell Oil Storage & Distributing Co, our ancestor built this petrol pump in 1929,” said Daw. By the time, Bharat Refineries acquired complete ownership of Burmah-Shell’s interests in India in 1976, Daw had taken over control of the business from his father. “We have practically seen the change around us and have changed ourselves according to it. We modernized our fuel station, had a service station and a large office, which we later replaced with in-and-out stores, and now we have increased our frontage to 100ft to meet the current specifications as we offer a large space for cars to enter and exit our fuel station with ease,” said Daw, whose family is also famous for organizing a Durga Puja for over 100 years at their Jorasanko home. However, among all the changes that the fuel station on CR Avenue has been part of, Daw said the spiralling rise in price of petrol and diesel over the last year has hurt him the most. “I have been in this business for long, but have never witnessed a situation like this. I have seen people coming to our fuel station and refilling their tanks to the brim. But that doesn’t happen regularly anymore and what used to be a lucrative business once has become a survival issue now. But we will continue with the business and so will my future generation. We will continue this legacy our ancestors had initiated,” said Daw.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/92-yr-old-petrol-pump-tracks-rising-graph-of-fuel-price/articleshow/84215614.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

This disparity is seen also at national level. As per the official data till Wednesday evening at pan India level, out of the total beneficiaries administered vaccine doses so far, 53.66% had been men and 46.32%% women — a gender gap of nearly 8%. A week ago, the difference was nearly 10%. The gap in Bihar is little more than the national average as 54.81% inoculated were males and 45.16% females. As per the state data, of the total 1,75,80,696 doses were administered till Wednesday evening, including 96,37,352 to men and only 79,40,086 to women. UNICEF communication specialist (Bihar) Nipurnh Gupta cited patriarchal mindset as one of the reasons for more men getting vaccinated. “There are many myths attached with the vaccination and fertility and menstrual hygiene. Also, people think that men have to go out so they should be vaccinated first. Health seeking behaviour is lacking among women,” she said and cited technological issues with women as another reason and how, in a few families, even kids were afraid of getting their mothers vaccinated. “Someone has to reach out to women with a message targeted them,” she added. Among the three categories in which the beneficiaries have been divided, the maximum vaccination has been done in the youngsters, even though their round started last in May. So far, 43.19% of doses have been administered to the young people, followed by 28.99% to those in the 45-60 age group and 27.81% to people above 60. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said various awareness programmes were being organized to remove vaccine hesitancy, if any. “We are also focusing on vaccination of females and a large number of Jeevika workers have been roped in to get these beneficiaries vaccinated,” Singh said, adding the facility for doorstep vaccination was also being provided to the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/men-outnumber-women-by-10-in-getting-vaccine-shots-in-bihar/articleshow/84212970.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Undergraduate students interested in learning technologies and building their career as a developer may join the club. From learning how to check a fake video or factcheck a news report to artificial intelligence-powered picture sharing and Android app development, students will be informed about technologies through various activities and quizzes organized under the club. Students will also be informed about various Google certification courses and how one can enroll in them. “Google Student Developer Club is a community group for college and university students interested in Google developer technologies. Students from all undergraduate or graduate programmes with interest in growing as a developer may join the club and increase their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for local businesses and their community,” said a BSc student Ankit Patel, who pitched for opening the club in LU. “Since LU is not a technical university, its name was not there in the list of institutions of Google where the club can be opened. After almost a year of applying, we have got the approval to run the club,” he said. “Google developer club has been highly beneficial for both students and community. Recently, young developers from the club in Saudi Arabia came together to help small local businesses. As more companies across the globe are relying on online sales, these students noticed that many of their favourite local stores did not have a presence on the web and they made it online. Similarly, LU students can also bring about a change after getting associated with the group,” said dean, student welfare, Poonam Tandon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-universitys-google-club-to-give-tech-push-to-students-career-goals/articleshow/84220203.cms||---

I still can’t believe I had to shell out Rs 2,000 for less than 20 litres of petrol today. Even last year, my monthly fuel budget was something around Rs 6,000. But now it has shot up to Rs 10,000 thanks to the century run of petrol. Had this price rise happened during a non-Covid period, I wouldn’t have thought twice on giving up on cars and switching to another mode of transport. But that is not an option any more. I can’t risk the health of my family or me by travelling on public transport in the midst of this pandemic. Hence, I have had to somehow increase the fuel budget. I remember buying fuel at Rs 53 when my father used to take me to refill his scooterette. In those days, even that seemed a lot. But as I look back, I seriously believe those were the golden days of driving. As a short-term measure, I have put a halt to all forms of long and short unnecessary drives for the time being and am using the car only for emergency purposes and drives to and from office. But since I don’t see the fuel price coming down any time soon, I have started thinking about investing in an electric car. It’s going to be a one-time investment and, in the long run, it is going to be easy on my pocket as well as on the environment. Bhadra, 31, from Dum Dum, who is an area sales manager at an automobile firm on Park Street, spoke to Amit Moulick||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/my-monthly-fuel-budget-has-risen-to-rs-10k-from-last-years-rs-6k/articleshow/84215423.cms||---

The deceased, identified as Kailash Yadav alias Kailu Yadav (40) of Gordhawa village under Deepnagar police station area, was a farmer by profession. SHO Mohammad Mushtaque said Pramod Yadav, 40, reached his cousin Kailash’s residence in the village in the afternoon. “Kailash was not at home. His wife Babita Devi alleged that Pramod inappropriately touched her back while cracking some joke which she protested,” he said. When Kailash returned home in the night, Babita narrated the incident. “An infuriated Kailash, along with around half a dozen relatives, reached at Pramod’s house in the neighbourhood and asked him why he had touched Babita inappropriately,” the SHO said. Heated arguments followed by stone-pelting took place from both sides. “Pramod pulled out a countrymade pistol and shot Kailash in his chest, resulting in his death,” he said. Nalanda Sadar SDPO Shibli Nomani said two empty cartridges and a bike were recovered from the spot. “Babita has lodged an FIR against six persons, including Pramod. All of them are evading arrest,” he said. Nomani said it was yet not clear whether they had any dispute. “Bricks and stones were lying scattered on the spot. At least four rounds were fired by Pramod. Two empty cartridges of 8mm have been recovered from the spot,” the SDPO said. He said neither Pramod nor Kailu had any criminal antecedents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hubby-killed-for-protesting-wifes-sexual-harassment/articleshow/84213430.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Addressing mediapersons at the Udyog Bhawan on Wednesday, state industries minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain said the framework of the policies was in its final stage. “The new policies, which will be presented to chief minister Nitish Kumar for his approval soon, will foster a long-term mutualism between the industries and the government,” he added. The minister had recently met investors and senior functionaries of the Synthetic Rayon and Textile Promotion Council, seeking suggestions for finalising the Bihar Textile and Leather Policy. Earlier, the state had rolled out the Oxygen Production Promotion Policy and Ethanol Production Promotion Policy. Within three months of the latter’s roll-out, 147 proposals have already received stage I clearance. Similarly, within two months of the oxygen policy, 13 proposals have cleared the first round. So far, the government has allocated 320 acres of land of the Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority to 10 units for setting up ethanol plants in the state. Shahnawaz claimed that Bihar was the first state to introduce an ethanol-related policy and other states were following suit. “Despite the challenges posed to the economy by the Covid-19 pandemic, Bihar has managed to attract 450 investment proposals amounting to Rs 33,973 crore in the last six months. The government has sped up approval of the proposals that may create employment opportunities for a large population,” he said and reiterated his commitment towards large-scale employment generation through massive industrialisation. The minister said, “Bihar has emerged as a state with unbound opportunities and is poised to lead the growth charts in future.” He also talked about the ‘Udyog Samwad Portal’ that has been launched as a one-stop platform for investors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-to-introduce-3-new-policies-to-woo-investors/articleshow/84215089.cms||Faryal Rumi

This is significant in the wake of widespread complaints about drug mismanagement during Covid-19 where prescription of high doses of steroids and antibiotics resulted in new health disorders among victims. Now, the Union government has brought an amendment to the Pharmacy Act, 1948, and Pharmacy Practice Regulations, 2015, to incorporate a ‘Clinical Pharmacist and Drug Information Pharmacist’ position. This would help graduates of Pharm-D courses to exclusively handle drug administration in hospitals. Doctor of Pharmacy Association (DPA) welcomed the move of Pharmacy Council of India and the ministry of health and family welfare. “This is the first step for ensuring that clinical pharmacists get a place in hospitals. We are now going to work with the central and state governments to get it implemented in all hospitals,” Dr Sai Kumar Katam, national president of DPA. He added that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended having a clinical pharmacist in every hospital as per the patient ratio, in order to provide cost effective and safe treatment to patients. Considered as an important cog in the wheel of the healthcare delivery mechanism, unlike developed countries, the role of clinical pharmacists is less defined in India. The new regulations will add a new dimension to clinical pharmacy practice which has so far remained in the background. Pharmacists will now be able to support patients in the use of medicines besides taking part in clinical decision-making. “India accounts for 5.2 million injuries annually with medication errors and adverse drug reactions. The need of the hour is to detect and manage adverse drug reactions, assist physicians in individualising the drug dosage regimen,” said Dr Sai Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/notification-on-clinical-pharmacist-posts-draws-praise/articleshow/84226167.cms||Samdani MN

The hospital’s medical superintendent, Dr C M Singh, told this reporter on Wednesday that the patient was recovering fast after the challenging surgery. The director of AIIMS-P, Dr P K Singh, congratulated the team, led by Dr Anil Kumar, for successfully conducting the difficult operation. Talking to this newspaper, Dr Anil said, “The girl was admitted here 15 days ago with a lump in her abdomen that caused breathing problems. She was operated upon on Monday and shifted to the intensive care unit.” The doctors declared on Wednesday that the 15-year-old was out of danger and recovering fast. “It was a challenging surgery as the tumour had spread to the chest cavity, pushed the diaphragm and started exerting pressure on the digestive tract. This led to multiple problems like loss of appetite and weight as well as breathing issues,” Dr Anil said, adding that the girl’s weight had reduced from 32kg to 20.5kg after removal of the tumour. This is the sixth case of a major tumour removal surgery at the AIIMS-P within a month. Dr Anil pointed out that utter negligence and lack of awareness towards health issues in rural areas led to the growth of such huge tumours. “If one develops a lump or a tumour, which is small and non-painful in nature, one should consult a doctor for avoiding any complications,” he urged people. Others, who were part of the team, included Dr Jagjit Pandey, Dr Satish, Dr Shiv, Dr Nishant Sahay and Dr Sarfaraj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aiims-p-doctors-remove-9-5kg-tumour-from-girls-abdomen/articleshow/84213200.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Visakhapatnam||Weekly shandies central in tribal heart of Vizag district||VISAKHAPATNAM: As many as 776 villages and hamlets are dependent on weekly shandies in Visakhapatnam district. This is the second highest in the country, followed by Mayurbhanj district in Odisha with 937 villages, as per an analysis done on the Mission Antyodaya 2019 data by India Data Portal, an open data-driven initiative of the Bharati Institute of Public Policy of the Indian School of Business (ISB). As per the IDP’s analysis, about 95,000 villages in the country have weekly haats. There is a higher concentration of weekly haats in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand. Even though these weekly markets are held in several rural areas of Visakhapatnam district, the weekly shandies serve as the nerve centre of the economy in the tribal pockets. People from the hilly regions of Araku and Paderu descend and trek for miles to reach these shandies every week. Apart from the sale or buying of agricultural commodities and other local produce, these markets provide a space for social and cultural interaction and recreational activities. K Govinda Rao, CPM leader from Araku, said: “In the absence of organised malls or regular mandis in the remotest tribal hamlets, the forest dwellers would depend on the shandies for the direct sale of minor local produce such as tamarind, gum, hill brooms, honey, adda leaves, firewood, etc. and vegetables and fruits. In turn, they would purchase essential commodities drawn from the plain areas of the district. Even poultry and cattle would be available in some weekly markets. Barter system is also practised in some places,” said Govinda Rao. Govinda Rao added that there are 41 weekly shandies in the tribal areas of the district. “For instance, there are two weekly haats in Ananthagiri mandal, including Damuku and Kasipatnam. The weekly haat is held in Sunkaramettah on Sundays. Likewise, shandies are held in Pedabayalu, Anantagiri Lambasingi, Majjigaruvu, Araku, Darakonda, Downuru, Kinchumanda, Paderu, Hukumpeta, Kasipatnam and Munchingput on different days of the week. Over the years, the infrastructure at the shandies has improved. Each shandy attracts people from tens of nearby hamlets. It is a melting pot for tribals scattered in the hilly region and for socialisation,” said Govinda Rao. The India Data Portal report added that economic growth in India is mostly demand-driven. “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, where the growth shows a downward trend, the weekly haats may help contribute to growth recovery through its rural demand generating capacity,” read the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/weekly-shandies-central-in-tribal-heart-of-vizag-district/articleshow/84215186.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The 12 banks fined Rs 1 crore each are Bandhan Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, Central Bank, Credit Suisse, Indian Bank, IndusInd Bank, Karnataka Bank, Karur Vysya Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, South Indian Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, and Utkarsh Small Finance Bank. Bank of Baroda has been fined Rs 2 crore, while State Bank of India was fined Rs 50 lakh. The RBI did not name the borrower. The RBI said that it was for non-compliance with certain provisions of directions issued by the central bank on lending to NBFCs. They have also failed to follow RBI’s directives in creating a central repository of large common exposures. The RBI had earlier asked banks to submit information on loans above a certain value to a Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC). Some of these banks had violated Section 19 (2) of the RBI Act, which states that no banking company shall hold shares in any company, whether as pledgee, mortgagee or absolute owner, of an amount exceeding 30% of the paid-up share capital of that company. The central bank also cited violation of Section 20 (1) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, which prohibits banks from granting loans to directors or companies in which their directors have an interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-fines-14-banks-over-loans-to-nbfc/articleshow/84217817.cms||---

There will be no vaccination for the 18-44 age group in the civic body’s Covishield centres on Thursday due to shortage of doses. After getting 46,000 doses of Covishield on Tuesday, the NMC facilitated this vaccine for 18-plus people at 140 centres on Wednesday. Nearly 32,269 people took Covishield. The civic body continued Covaxin at five centres where 1,201 took the jab. Thus, 33,470 vaccinations took place at NMC’s centres. On Wednesday, at 12 private vaccination centres, 3,114 took the jab. Therefore, total vaccination was 36,584 in the city on Wednesday which was the highest-ever in a day since vaccination programme commenced on January 16. Previous highest vaccination in the city was 36,584 on June 7. The NMC has been left with around 13,500 doses of Covishield. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said vaccination will continue only for 45-plus people on Thursday due to shortage of doses. “Vaccination for above 18 will resume after supply of fresh stock from the government. Vaccination of 18 plus will continue at centres of Covaxin on Thursday,” he said. After taking a hit in a majority of centres in the last two days, the zilla parishad (ZP) resumed vaccination on Wednesday. It received 31,600 doses of Covishield a day ago. A record inoculation of 26,901 was done in rural areas of the district on Wednesday. The previous highest vaccination was 25,685 in rural on April 3. The ZP will continue inoculation for the above 18 category on Thursday. The demand for vaccination has increased since the government resumed inoculation for the 18-44 age group on June 23. Vaccination took place only on six out of the last 15 days. The government is not supplying sufficient number of doses. In the city, vaccination will be hit for the tenth time in the last 16 days due to shortage of doses. The district will get a boost after record vaccination on Wednesday. The state’s public health department had stated that doses are being distributed on the basis of three days of past performance of the districts.

According to civil engineering experts from Andhra University, who visited the site to examine the reason behind the collapse, the flyover had eight beams out of which two beams collapsed. “There was no interlink between the beams, which caused the accident. Why was traffic allowed to pass under the flyover when the construction was not completed? There is no diversion road, nor are there lights,” YSRC’s Anakapalli constituency observer Dadi Ratnakar said.

Though the company did not disclose the financial details of the buy, it is expected to be in the sub $5 million range. yBANQ helps businesses with payments collection, reconciliation, and automated bookkeeping. With this acquisition, Clear aims to make its foray into the B2B payments management and credit space after establishing itself in taxation, compliance, e-invoicing, wealth management and other areas. Clear also plans to build a B2B Business Network to connect its customers with their business partners — vendors, customers, distributors, accountants — on a single platform. Through this network, the company hopes to solve for use cases across procurement, invoicing, payments, and collections. Founded in 2019 by Abhishek Ayyagari, Ganesh Mallya, and Ahamed Shah Wahidullah, who were previously associated with popular fintech startups like PayPal, Citrus Payments and PayU, yBANQ is roughly a 15-member team across product and engineering who will join Clear post the deal. Clear claims that it processes around 10% of India’s business invoices worth more than $300 billion. The company, which was also incubated in Y Combinator, has raised $65 million in equity since its inception in 2011.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/clear-buys-payments-startup-ybanq/articleshow/84217132.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Dharmendra Singh, a tent house operator and a resident of Gulab Chandra KaHata, lives with his wife Sudha and their two children-son Sagar (21) and daughter Sonali (23). The daughter told the police that her father was addicted to drinking and used to thrash them whenever they protested his drinking habit. She said on late Tuesday night, when he returned home in a drunk state, her mother and brother admonished him. Enraged over this he started beating them. “When they tried to raise an alarm and seek help from neighbours, my father forced my mother and brother to consume poison and later set the household belongings on fire,” she further told the police. After visiting the spot, the police somehow doused the fire by reaching inside the house through the roof and sent the mother-son duo to the hospital, where the condition of both of them was stated to be out of danger. Station in-charge Satish Singh said, “Investigations are continuing and the accused has been taken into custody.”Both the injured are undergoing treatment at city hospital.

Even if one considers the entire population, including those in the below 18-year age category, around half of the population is now vaccinated. The vaccination process has faced many hiccups on various fronts with inadequate and erratic supply of the doses being the major issue. Till recently, vaccine hesitation was also a major contributor towards the sluggish pace of the drive. However, active participation of NGOs, religious and spiritual leaders as well as trade and business organizations have given a significant momentum to the drive. The vaccinated population of the city now includes 10,10,346 persons who have taken one dose of the vaccine. Also, there are 2,76,684 persons who have taken the second dose too. Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that the numbers were high over the last few days except on Tuesday. “The pace of Vadodara’s vaccination drive is better than other large cities in the state,” he said. Patel said that the estimate of adult population was drawn from the number of voters registered in the city for the latest civic elections. “We had around 13.5 lakh voters. The total population of the city is around 20 to 21 lakh,” he added. The vaccination has also been fuelled by the state government’s announcements of allowing only vaccinated persons to run business establishments. The city police too has conducted awareness and vaccination drives. A major contributor behind the recent surge in the vaccination numbers has been the Baroda Muslim Doctors Association (BMDA). Thousands have been vaccinated after awareness drives by the association in the city since last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vax-drive-gathers-pace-in-vadodara/articleshow/84214112.cms||Sachin Sharma

---||Business||PNB asks housing finance arm to rework Carlyle deal||Mumbai: Punjab National Bank has asked its arm PNB Housing Finance (PNBHF) to rework a controversial preferential issue of shares to Carlyle and other investors. PNBHF has said that since the matter is sub judice with the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), it would await the tribunal’s order. While the bank has taken a stance that — irrespective of the tribunal’ order — the housing finance company should rework the deal, PNBHF seems to be holding a different view. By declaring that it will await the tribunal’s order before reworking the deal, it seems to indicate that it would go ahead if the SAT permits the deal. PNBHF on Wednesday informed the stock exchange that it had received a letter from its parent where the bank said that it had obtained a legal opinion on the housing financing arm’s equity issue and held a board meeting on July 3, 2021 to deliberated on the legal opinion. In the meeting, the bank’s board decided that PNBHF should take cognisance of Sebi’s June 18, 2021, directive and reconsider “restructuring the contours of the deal/transaction of the capital-raising in line with Sebi directive”. Last month, Sebi had stalled PNBHF’s preferential issue, which would have given Carlyle — an existing investor — a controlling stake. PNBHF had appealed to the SAT. While the PNBHF shareholders voted on the allotment, the outcome was kept in abeyance until the tribunal came out with its order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pnb-asks-housing-finance-arm-to-rework-carlyle-deal/articleshow/84217801.cms||---

Floodwaters are still there, including in the plots of arable land. Farmers have also suffered damages,” Nitish said after the high-level review meeting following an aerial survey of Darbhanga, Samastipur and Madhubani districts on Wednesday. The CM, along with water resources department (WRD) minister Sanjay Kumar Jha and its secretary Sanjeev Hans, had made aerial survey of the flood-affected West Champaran, East Champaran, Sitamarhi, Sheohar and Muzafarpur districts on Tuesday. At the meeting, Hans presented the details of the flooded areas. DMD principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit presented the steps taken for the distribution of relief materials and also for providing other kinds of assistance to the flood victims. The DMs of the eight districts also participated through videoconferencing. The CM said back in 2007, around 2.5 crore people were affected by floods and they were provided with both security and relief assistance. Similarly, the flood-hit people could also be provided assistance, he added. He also asked the DMs to make spot inspection or the aerial survey of the flooded areas, besides making proper assessment of the damages suffered by the farmers so that they could be given the required assistance. Meanwhile, the water level in Bagmati, Burhi Gandak, Kamla and Adhwara group of rivers was stationary or falling, but it was still around the danger mark. Among the major rivers, the water discharge through Birpur barrage across the Kosi was stationary at 1.4 lakh cusecs, and that through Valmiki Nagar barrage across the Gandak was at the 1.51 lakh cusecs mark. Further, the Ganga was flowing far below the danger level all along its downstream from Buxar to Kahalgaon via Digha, Gandhi Ghat, Hathidah, Munger and Bhagalpur. Similarly, Mahanada river was also flowing below the danger level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-to-officials-ensure-timely-relief-to-flood-hit-people-farmers/articleshow/84213383.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Patna||Ex-IAS officer RCP hits it big, from Nitish’s personal secretary to Union minister||PATNA: Rarely do senior bureaucrats make mass political leaders, and still rare is for a bureaucrat to stick his heels and also last in active politics even if as backroom boy, besides hitting it big. JD(U) national president and Rajya Sabha member Ram Chandra Prasad Singh (62), who on Wednesday became Union minister in the NDA government led by PM Narendra Modi, has made a good harvest of his short political career. It took him 11 years for it, since he took voluntary retirement from service as an IAS officer of the UP cadre in 2010 to be on the side of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar in the JD(U) as his confidant. Both Nitish and RCP belong to the same same Kurmi caste in Nalanda district. Nitish had first discovered RCP when as railway minister he chose him to become his personal secretary (PS). Subsequently, after Nitish led the NDA the state government in November 2005, he kept RCP as his principal secretary till 2010, when he took VRS and joined the JD(U). Nitish sent him to the Rajya Sabha the same year and then in 2016 when he was also made the JD(U) general secretary to look after the party’s organizational matters. He was made the party’s national president in December last year. That way, the stock of RCP has kept rising through the last 11 years, which also saw the tumultuous period in the political career of Nitish. The question being also asked is to what extent RCP influenced his political decisions? For, if the period (2010-21) threw up fast-paced developments, surprises and shocks for Nitish, what has also been starkly visible is the relative decline of the JD(U) in the electoral arena and the emergence of the BJP as the “elder brother” within the NDA fold. The most shocking of all was the fall of the JD(U) in 2020 when it won only 43 assembly seats against the BJP’s 74. While Nitish tried to improve his party’s electoral scope in 2015 by banking on poll strategist Prashant Kishore, RCP resisted the move of elevating him to the post of JD(U) national vice-president. Similarly, RCP also resisted the recent move of Nitish to bring back former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha into the JD(U) to forge afresh the ‘Luv-Kush’ or ‘Kurmi-Koeri’ caste combination. Today, with RCP in the Union cabinet, Kushwaha is well ensconced in the JD(U) and, in fact, has been asked by Nitish to take care of the party, implying that RCP could quit the post of the JD(U) national president under “one man, one post” formula, observers feel.

People’s response, however, was lukewarm as many fitness enthusiasts, who would hit the gym everyday during the pre-Covid times, preferred to stay home. Although Abhishek Tiwari, the owner of a gym on Bailey Road, had restricted the number of visitors on each floor, only a few people could be spotted on Day 1. “I have made physical distancing mandatory so that the virus does not spread,” he told this newspaper and added that all the trainers and staff had been fully inoculated. The owner of another gym, Gautam Kumar, expressed his concern over the huge losses he incurred during the Covid-induced lockdown. He rued, “Despite no income for almost two months, I had to pay rent to my landlord.” At Gautam’s gym on Jagdeo Path, nobody is allowed to share bottles or sanitizers. Covid safety protocols are also followed strictly. Anny Singh, who runs a gym on Saguna Mor, brought to light the insecurity among customers. “Even if we are adopting Covid-appropriate behaviour, only 50 customers visited the gym on Day 1,” she said, hoping to see a rise in footfalls soon. Meanwhile, Prakash Kumar, a fitness enthusiast, claimed that he was eager to hit the gym, but “it is better to get myself vaccinated before I do so”. Another youngster, Adithya Gupta, said, “Going to the gym everyday has been an integral part of my life. I felt restless for a long time.” Restaurants reopen: As part of Unlock 5, restaurants also reopened with 50% capacity on Wednesday. Dushyant Raj, the manager of a popular restaurant on Fraser Road, said, “People should not be hesitant because we are sanitising our restaurant regularly and following Covid safety norms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/low-footfalls-a-matter-of-concern-for-gym-owners/articleshow/84213120.cms||---

After the girls didn’t return home at night, their father contacted police and lodged a complaint against a local man. Initially, police started searching for the missing girls, but they couldn’t be located. On Wednesday, an FIR under sections 363 (abduction) and 366 (abducting a woman to compel her marriage) of IPC was registered against one Arif. The main accused was having an alleged affair with the eldest sister, 19, but the girl couldn’t be found at his home. In the complaint, the girl’s father alleged that his daughters were called at home by Arif’s mother and since then they are missing and their phones are switched off. Since the accused belong to another faith, Bisauli SHO Rajeev Sharma has placed two constables in the village to ensure peace in the area. Surveillance team is trying to trace the location of the missing girls using their mobile location. Rajeev Sharma told TOI, “We had started our investigation immediately after receiving the complaint. Main suspect Arif is in our custody and we are questioning him.

And we are putting all our effort to find them at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/3-sisters-missing-in-budaun-man-booked-for-abduction/articleshow/84213569.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The duo also filmed the shop using the mobile and returned home to plan the heist.“Kamal Chowk is always crowded. Moreover, the shop there is in the basement. It will take about four to five minutes for them to reach the road after committing the crime. They believed it was risky to rob the shop at Kamal Chowk, so the two decided to target Avni Jewellers,” said police.Accordingly, Pandey summoned his three accomplices from Uttar Pradesh to Nagpur.

The last one-and-a-half years have been extremely bad for businesses, especially the construction industry, which we are in. We sell iron rods and the sales are exceedingly low these days. The increasing fuel prices have made the situation worse. Earlier, I used to keep one car entirely for my office staff and three for my family. My family members and I used to travel in separate cars and attended office at different times. But not anymore. Now, I have kept the office car at home and my family members heading to office travel together. We have even cut down on all sorts of unnecessary expenses, like dining out and long drives. I have seen petrol selling for less than Rs 10 back in 1989, and could never imagine that a day would come when the same fuel would be sold for more than Rs 100. Even a year ago, I could buy 10 litres of petrol for Rs 700. But on Wednesday, Rs 700 wasn’t enough for even 7 litres. It is frustrating and is taking a toll on my pocket. If the fuel price continues to rise the way it has been, I may soon have to sell one of the cars to maintain the family budget.

---||Allahabad||Uttar Pradesh: Plans to develop eighth century Sun temple in Pratapgarh district||PRAYAGRAJ: A team of the state tourism department and Uttar Pradesh Project Corporation Limited has conducted a survey to revive the eighth century Sun temple in Shivganj village under Gaura gram sabha of Pratapgarh district. The villagers under the banner of Bhayharan Nath Dham Kshetriya Vikas Sansthan initially took initiatives to preserve idols, pillars and structures of the ancient Surya temple since 2016, and even removed encroachments near the temple site with the help of other locals. They have now been constantly writing to the tourism department to take up maintenance of the remains of the ruined temple and to develop the area. General secretary of the Sansthan, Samaj Shekhar, told TOI that a team of the tourism department and Uttar Pradesh Project Corporation Limited conducted a survey of the ancient temple last month. He further added that the team of tourism department picked up the ancient Sun temple after the state government moved the proposal to develop areas associated with ancient saints and sages in the state. Shekhar said that a group of villagers had initiated steps to revive Sun temple built in the eighth century, and even held a series of meetings with the officials concerned. Claiming that a majority of people have no idea of the existence of the Sun temple in a remote village of Pratapgarh district, volunteers from Baba Bhayharan Nath Dham Ksher tiya Vikas Sansthan were the first to come forward to apprise people about the ruins of the historical edifice and sought their assistance to develop and maintain the area in and around the temple. Shekhar, meanwhile, informed that a team of Archeological Survey of India (ASI) had visited the spot in 2011 and registered seven of its remains, directing gram panchayat of Gaura to follow the rules under the Antiquities and Art Act, 1972. The ASI, too, had said the temple dated back to Purva Madhya Kal (pre-medieval period). Puneet Pandey, supervisor (Pratapgarh), Uttar Pradesh Project Corporation Limited, told TOI that there are plans to develop the area as a religious tourist spot and a work plan is being mooted in the same regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/plans-to-develop-ancient-sun-temple-in-pratapgarh/articleshow/84214599.cms||Kapil Dixit

The police reached the spot and rounded up three youths, and brought them to Darwha police station. Cops allegedly thrashed the youths mercilessly, and one of them collapsed. The cops took him to the Government Rural Hospital, where the doctors attending on him declared him ‘brought dead’. The name of the deceased is Sheikh Irfan Sheikh Shabbir (27), a resident of Railway Station area. The other two were Golu Sheikh and Amir Sheikh, both residents of Railway Station locality.

The students said the exam was too close and they should not lose out on an opportunity to attempt it. The SPPU exam department said the complaints were being considered and colleges were being told to act upon them. Vice-president of Yukrant Pune, a students’ association, Kamlakar Shete, said, “Many colleges had not forwarded the exam forms to the university. After pointing it out to the exam department, the varsity instructed colleges to inward the forms that the colleges had forgotten and students were registered for the exam.” The SPPU Education Foundation has also created a YouTube channel to explain the process of filling the examination forms and also the process of submission for the assistance of students and college authorities. Shete said the students must watch the video and at the same time ensure that they do not miss out on any step that would lead to the shortfall. Exam department head at SPPU Mahesh Kakde said, “We are taking care to ensure that the students’ enrolment for the examinations is smooth. No student is left out from the process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/students-say-colleges-negligent-about-submitting-exam-forms-to-varsity/articleshow/84215745.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Lucknow||Covid-19: Uttar Pradesh records 2 Delta-plus cases for first time, 1 victim dies||LUCKNOW: Genome sequencing of Covid-19 positive samples from Uttar Pradesh has revealed two cases with the Delta plus strain, which is more transmissible and evades body’s immunity. In May, 100 samples were routinely sent to Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi, and the reports were received on Tuesday. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad, said: “The cases were identified during genome sequencing of samples in the state. Surfacing of Delta plus virus makes Covid-19 appropriate behaviour very essential.” Till date, more than 1,000 samples have been sent for genome sequencing from the state to various labs. Of these, over 80% tested positive to Delta variant, while about 6% tested positive to the alpha strain. The two cases of Delta plus strain have been reported for the first time. Insiders revealed the two patients, who hail from Gorakhpur and Deoria districts of eastern UP, had contracted the infection in May. While one of them was a 66-year-old resident of Deoria who died during treatment, the other is a 23-year-old resident doctor at Baba Raghav Das Medical College, Gorakhpur. The two had no travel history and were unrelated. “The elderly contracted infection on May 7 and was treated at home till his health deteriorated and he was shifted to BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur. He died during course of treatment on May 29. He had no travel history and all 27 contacts tested negative to Covid-19,” said health department sources. The other, a resident doctor at BRD Medical College, tested positive to Covid-19 on May 26. She remained in home isolation for a week and recovered. Experts say Delta Plus could drive the anticipated third wave and over 500 cases of this variety have already been recorded in 10 states, including Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala among others. Assuring that the state was on high alert to isolate cases of Delta plus strain in early stages, ACS Prasad said: “The second wave is on the wane. Daily cases are dipping and recovery rate has soared to 98.6%. However, presence of two Delta plus cases makes Covid-19 appropriate behaviour extremely important.” Meanwhile, data indicated that 120 new cases and 191 recoveries were reported in past 24 hours in the state, which also recorded 11 deaths. The number of active cases in state was 1,947, including 1351 in home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-records-2-delta-plus-cases-for-first-time-1-victim-dies/articleshow/84220242.cms||Shailvee Sharda

We have been requesting the civic body to allow us to resume our business at the flower market. But we are yet to receive a positive response from the corporation.”With no proper place to do business, the vendors are selling flowers by sitting on platforms outside the market, he said. Only 10% of the regular vendors have returned to their business while remaining are waiting for the allocation of a proper place.Another vendor Ganesan said as they cannot afford to lose their business any longer, they resumed their business without waiting for the corporation to allocate a place.“Even though the state government has permitted us to resume our business, both the corporation and police are imposing penalty citing flimsy reasons. We have been forced to shell out a portion of our revenue for the penalty itself,” he said.Explaining that they have been earning only 20% to 30% of their normal revenue, he said as they have no space to unload the flowers, they have reduced the quantity of flowers that they purchase.Within a couple of hours into our business, the flowers wither as they are kept directly under the sun, another vendor said.“If we move to Shastri Maidan, our business would reduce further as it is not close to bus stop,” he added.When contacted, a senior corporation official said that they have been planning to allocate new flower market located opposite to the old one on temporary basis as the civic body has been planning to renovate the old market.“We are in talks with the vendors and a solution will be attained soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/vendors-want-flower-market-on-mettupalayam-road-reopened/articleshow/84218144.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Welcome extension of road tax waiver but sop too little, too late, say Bus operators||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday announced the extension of the 100% waiver of road tax for commercial passenger vehicles, like buses, taxis and autos, till December 31, given the financial hardship that transport operators have been facing amid the pandemic and the consequent restrictions on public transport.  Beleaguered transport operators welcomed the waiver and appreciated Banerjee’s concern for the sector, but pointed out that the offer was too little and too late, compared to the “enormity of the crisis”. Bus operators, however, promised to try and ply as many buses as possible to end commute woes. “We welcome the move and appreciate the concern of the chief minister for us. But in reality, the relief will be too small, compared to the enormity of our crisis. We request the government to offer every bus operator a loan of Rs 2 lakh from the district cooperative bank to help them make a turn-around, apart from revising the bus fare. Bus operators have exhausted all their resources to run buses during the pandemic, when diesel prices scaled record heights,” said Tapan Banerjee, secretary of Joint Council of Bus Syndicates. The waiver on road tax had been in place from January 1 to June 30. The Joint Council of Bus Syndicates said they had no problems with any of their members plying buses. “People are facing huge commute problems. But we are also undergoing an existential crisis,” Banerjee added. Some private buses could be spotted on roads on Wednesday but they were too few to plug the demand-supply gap. Office-goers still had to hitch a ride on Matador vans in the absence of enough buses. The waterlooged roads on Wednesday added to commute woes. “Even mini buses demanded double the fare to ferry passengers. From Esplanade to Shyambazar, they hiked the fare from Rs 30 to Rs 60 a passenger. We had little option but to board one as there were waterlogged stretches on Central Avenue,” said Anirban Ghosh, a trader on Pollock Street. Operators of school buses and chartered buses were happy. “We appealed for this relief. We are glad that the government extended the waiver as most of the operators are facing financial shortage with their vehicles not plying during the pandemic,” said West Bengal Contract Carriage Operators’ and Owners’ Association representative Himadri Ganguly. The afternoon rain gave taxi drivers the opportunity to triple their fares, which they had been charging double so far. “From Esplanade to Bhowanipore, metered taxis demanded Rs 300 on Wednesday afternoon. This is the fallout when Metro does not run,” said Badrinarayan Goswami, an owner of a shop. The road tax waiver notwithstanding, Bengal Taxi Association, the biggest of the metered taxi operators’ associations, may resort to a taxi strike with the demand of a fare hike. “We are holding a meeting on Friday. We may go on a strike, if all members agree to join the protest,” said a member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/welcome-extension-of-road-tax-waiver-but-sop-too-little-too-late-bus-operators/articleshow/84218236.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Lucknow||On every trip to Lucknow, Dilip Kumar saab feasted on succulent kebabs of Tunday’s||LUCKNOW: Every time the legendary actor, Dilip Kumar, got the opportunity to visit the City of Nawabs, he made sure to have one thing on his ‘to-do list’ – relishing the succulent Tunday kebabs. “I used to get calls from Dilip saab for kebabs every time he visited the city. It was never possible for him to visit us as our shop is located in a crowded area. However, we made sure that our kebabs reach him,” recalled Mohd Usman, owner of Tunday Kababi in Aminabad. “He was very fond of our kebabs. Back in 1988, I was in Mumbai (then Bombay) to attend Awadh Food Festival at Hotel Oberoi. I invited Dilip saab for dinner with us but as he was unwell, he invited me to his place,” he said. “I still remember his hospitality and warmth. He had built a mosque at his place where I also offered namaz. We had a long chat after which I got a photograph clicked with him. I still have that photograph which will always stay with me as a fond memory of a great actor and a good human being,” Usman said. Recalling the actor’s love for kebabs, Abu Bakr of Tunday Kababi in Chowk said, “We did not get the privilege to play host to Dilip saabat our outlet but once his wife and actress, Saira Bano, visited us. However, every time Dileep saab visited the city, he used to order kebabs from our outlet. He even asked for delivery of kebabs from Lucknow to Delhi and Mumbai.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/on-every-trip-dilip-saab-feasted-on-succulent-kebabs-of-tundays/articleshow/84220312.cms||Fazal Khan

On Monday, while the defence waited for Soni’s remand hearing before the special NIA court, the judge was apprised that he was taken to a magistrate court where his statement was recorded and he had been remanded to judicial custody. Moving the bail plea, defence advocate Rahul Arote said that since the accused was remanded without his presence, the order sending him to jail custody was “illegal.” Last week, the court had sent accused Soni and co accused Satish Mothkuri to NIA custody until Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/man-arrested-in-hiran-murder-case-moves-spl-nia-cour/articleshow/84221448.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Internet facilities in just 30,000 schools for learning||PUNE: Only 30,000 of the 1.1 lakh schools in Maharashtra have internet connection, the unified district information system for education (UDISE) data show. Schools mainly run by the state government were poorly connected to the web and a majority of the teachers were using their own smartphones for conducting online classes. Education across the globe has been online for over a year and most educators feel that future learning will be a blended one in online and offline modes. The all-India average of schools with internet facilities was 22.2 % which included private and government management schools. In Maharashtra, 35.9% schools had internet facilities on their campuses. This included private and government schools. In the entire country, Chandigarh had the best internet facility with over 97% of schools connected to the web. However, the number of schools in the state was fairly less as compared to others with only 229 institutions. States that had over one lakh schools included Rajasthan (1,06,240), Uttar Pradesh (2,54,352) and Madhya Pradesh (1,33,379) schools apart from Maharashtra and among these, the latter had the best percentage having internet facilities. Former director of education Vasant Kalpande said internet connection was no longer a luxury. “Internet connection is now a necessity. Even vaccination cannot be done without internet because before taking the shot recipients require registration which was impossible without internet connection. In the same way, the government must proudly be able to announce that every village in the state was equipped with an internet facility.” Kalpande said the government must immediately reach out to villages that did not have the facility and make them a priority so that schools are equipped fully as blended education with parts of syllabus being conducted only online and some parts offline being the future. The situation in Maharashtra was particularly disappointing in government schools as 7,149 schools of a total 65,000 and above had internet connections. After the Covid-19 pandemic spread across the country, schools shut down for offline education and for over one year, classes are being conducted online only. Teachers have been managing to conduct classes on their personal smartphones and their demands to the government have been long due to reimburse the mobile internet charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/education-goes-online-but-net-connectivity-in-just-30k-schools-in-state/articleshow/84215863.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Boyfriend fired from job, lover tries to torch factory||RAJKOT: A vengeful woman employee at a Gandhidham-based firm attempted to torch a factory unit after her boyfriend was fired from his job. According to Gandhidham police, the incident occurred at Canam international (P) Ltd, at Gandhidham on July 5 at around 5.30pm. Mayaben Parmar (24), a resident of Ganesh Nagar in Gandhidham and native of Banaskantha, tried to set the factory ablaze by using a lighter and burning a cloth-ladden trolly, said cops. “The workers at the unit saw the fire and extinguished it immediately and averted major disaster as there was huge cloth stock at the unit where the fire had occurred. After the incident, management checked the CCTV footage to check how the fire took place and saw Parmar lighting the stack of clothes,” police sources said. Sources said that Canam international (P) Ltd specialized in sorting and recycling of used clothes and is part of the the Canam Group that has presence in North America, India and Africa. The complete work process of a Used Clothing plant consists of sorting, grading, packing and dispatch. “When the management questioned Parmar why she wanted to burn down the factory, the woman revealed that she was angry after the company fired her boyfriend (Vinod) from his job. The ‘anguished lover’ decided to set the unit on fire on revenge,” an official said. After this revelation, company’s GM Harish Madapallikutti Gopalan lodged a criminal complaint against Parmar with Gandhidham police under various sections of IPC including 436, 427 among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/firm-fires-man-lover-tries-to-burn-factory/articleshow/84215847.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Yusuf Khan has passed away, but immortal Dilip Kumar lives on||LUCKNOW: He was 76 then, exactly 23 years ago, when I did an exclusive interview with thespian Dilip Kumar, for the Lucknow Times. The actor was in the city to be bestowed with the Sahu Avadh Samman and Lucknowites were at their welcoming best. Big crowds had sprung up on the road leading to the hotel where he was staying and the hotel lobby had an unprecedented crowd, which even the special security were finding difficult to control. Negotiating the meandering queues and security checks, all flustered and heckled, with great difficulty I managed to finally reach his heavily guarded room. As I was ushered into the room, I felt a magical calmness. Dressed in crisp spotless white attire, his long tapering fingers holding a cup of tea, sat before the ‘Tragedy King’ of Indian cinema, a legend, an icon, the first ‘Khan’ of the Indian film Industry. I felt mesmerized. And after the brief introduction, for the next one hour, it was me listening to the legend. In his impeccable English, intercepted with chaste Urdu and flawless Hindi, coupled with the inimitable style, he opened his soul. Just two months back Dilip Kumar had been awarded the Nishan-e-Imtiaz, Pakistan’s highest civilian award, and this highly decorated actor (Padma Vibhushan) expressed joy at being recognized in the country of his birth (he was born in Peshawar in December 1922). There were lines of pain etched on his face as he expressed his hurt at being embroiled in a controversy and declared “unpatriotic” by the Shiv Sena. He spoke his heart out on the issue. He called this reward one for Dilip, the actor, and not for Yusuf, the Indian citizen. He was very critical of the increasing communal divide in the country and spoke openly about the minority syndrome he experienced after the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition. Another point of conversation which again the actor chose to speak on was the conflict that he always experienced between Yusuf Khan (his name by birth) and Dilip Kumar (his screen name). I recall him clearly taking the side of Dilip and asserting that actually it is him who works so hard but it is Yusuf who runs away with applause and awards. As the interview time drew to a close and it was time to bid goodbye, I suddenly realized that I had not asked him any of the questions I had prepared to ask. But a couple of hours later when I sat at my computer to key in my story, I realized that in fact I had got a better copy than what I had anticipated. This was because I was lucky that the actor chooses to speak from his soul. The waiting multitude outside in the lobby was of all ages and faith. Their eyes gleamed even at me –after all I had met the man who ruled their hearts. This morning when I opened my eyes to the news of the actor’s death, I felt as if the thespian was whispering in my ears, “Remember what I told you 23 years back, Dilip Kumar always took all the bows, today he even succeeded in getting all the tears…” Of course, I could understand what he meant. ‘Rest in peace, Yusuf Khan’, I said under my breath as I recited a surey fateha for him. You are immortal, Dilip Kumar. I know you will live as long as Bollywood.

Those arrested were identified as Shivraj Vala (19), Gaurava Hirani (21), Lalji Rank (21), and a minor boy. Hirani and Rank are residents of Bagasara town of Amreli while Vala is a native of Faddang village and lives in Surat. The 62-year-old Vallabh Khunt, a farmer who also works as a land broker, had lodged a complaint against the four persons with Kuvadava Road police on July 3. “On July 3, Vala and his associates kidnapped Khunt from his village and demanded Rs 15 lakh while threatening to kill him. Scared by the revolver that was pointed towards him, Kunth paid Rs 3.85 lakh to the accused. Later, he approached the police and lodged a complaint,” police said. A fortnight ago, a complaint was lodged against Vala and Hirani for creating ruckus at a hotel in Sarthana area of Surat. Since then they have been staying in a farm at Faddang village. Later, they hatched a plan to extort money from Khunt. Interestingly, police later found that the revolver used to scare Khunt was a toy gun. The cops also seized a car and mobile phones from the accused. In the past Vala was named in two cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/four-including-a-minor-held-for-extortion/articleshow/84215718.cms||---

And after that in the CMO, the memorandum was submitted to the chief minister’s joint secretary Lalit Kumar as well.A letter was sent from the governor’s side to the vice-chancellor of Shri Karan Narendra Agricultural University, which he has received for further action. Now, the decision to reduce the fees has to be taken by the vice-chancellor and the state government which all the students are waiting for.

Earlier these exams were to be held in just the divisional headquarters.

The UPSESSB exam controller on June 30 had sent a missive to district magistrates of those 18 districts which were designated divisional headquarters in the state and asked them to submit a proposal regarding examination centres for the recruitment exams by July 7. However, now on July 3, he has once again sent a letter to all district magistrates of all 75 districts of the state asking them to submit a proposal for the exam centres for conducting these recruitment exams by July 10, shared UPSESSB officials aware of the development. The TGT Recruitment Exams-2021 is proposed to be held on August 7 and August 8 while the PGT Recruitment Exams-2021 is set to be held on August 17 and August 18.

The bypass constructed in 2008 is important for those travelling from Ahmedabad to Junagadh and Porbandar.The court, while deciding the anticipatory bail application of one of the accused in this case, drew attention of the authority to carry out the repairs immediately to avoid any further unfortunate mishaps. After the incident, the state government had ordered a magisterial inquiry and based on the report, the NHAI had registered an FIR with Aji dam police station in October 2020 against concessionaires and consultants of relevant time and present time. One of the accused Karni Mathur had moved for anticipatory bail. The 10th additional session judge, Hetal Manoharrao Pavar, while granting anticipatory bail to Mathur, also drew the attention of the authorities concerned for the repair of the collapsed portion in her order. The advocates appearing on behalf of the government and accused both informed the court that till date the disputed highway road is open and the damaged portion is covered only by a cloth curtain, thereby risking lives of commuters passing by the dangerous portion. The court order noted, “Thus, it has come to the notice of this court that even after occurrence of this unfortunate incident causing death of two innocent persons, neither the NHAI nor any other authority concerned nor the government has taken care to make repairs. Non-repairing of the damaged portion of collapsed wall is equally dangerous and there is apprehension for the occurrence of such an incident again.” Advocate Tushar Gokani, appearing for the accused, said, “The court, considering its duty to draw the attention of NHAI officers as well as Rajkot collector, reminded the need of urgent repairs of damaged portions on Rajkot-Gondal national highway to avoid another such incident.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/court-reminds-nhai-to-repair-collapsed-portion-of-overbridge-wall/articleshow/84215894.cms||---

The ED has issued a statement that the project was attached on June 25 after it found that Adarsh Builder State Ltd had generated funds for the project through fraud. The statement reads the circulation of news of RERA order can lead to misconceptions among general population and cause undue financial losses to persons who may take stakes in project by investing their money with agents of spurious intent. “The attachment of this office u/s 5 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 does not allow tampering of this property unless otherwise decided by PMLA special court or adjudication authority. As such, any act to tamper with current status of properties under attachment is invariably an attempt to frustrate criminal proceedings under prevention of Money laundering Act, 2002,” the statement said. RERA officials, however, claimed that in an order on February 10, the ED was made a party and it was heard before releasing the orders. The directorate should have appealed the tribunal, if they were dissatisfied with the RERA orders. In the RERA order it was also mentioned to clear the ED dues after selling the unsold flats. RERA registrar Ramesh Sharma said, “The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act is specially enacted for the protection of home buyers. The orders were issued to safeguard the investment of 150 flat owners. The RERA only sought permission from the state government after the order was not challenged in the tribunal by any agency.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hyde-park-project-was-attached-on-june-25-says-ed/articleshow/84218271.cms||---

During his last visit to Trichy in January last year, the 84-year-old not only met his family members at his native Virgalur near Lalgudi but also paid a visit to the residence of A Gregory, a city-based environment worker. “It was a memorable event when Fr Stan visited us and shared the struggles of the people in northern India against injustices. Like many others, I too believe he is alive and we will continue our social action,” said Gregory, the project director of Voice Trust. Recalling his days as a student at Indian Social Institute (ISI) in Bengaluru where Fr Stan was director in 1975, he said, “His teachings took my life to a new direction. When the company I was working for as regional manager in 1987 encountered CPM-led agitations, I took his advice and motivated the management to listen to the grievances of 240 workers. I could help workers get justice because of Fr Stan,” Gregory said.Fr A Santhanam, 54, an advocate practising in Madurai, said Fr Stan led a simple life that reflected the life of tribal people in Jharkhand. “He was a very good trainer analysing the social structure. It helps everyone understand the reality with the true perspective of the downtrodden,” he said. Fr Santhanam was surprised that he had trained many people in Tamil Nadu. “It was only when he was arrested that we came to know about his followers. Fr Stan found happiness in meeting his friends,” he said. Advocate S Martin recalled Fr Swamy’s guest lectures at St Joseph’s College about eradicating disparities in society. “Fr Stan used to talk about societal analysis. Being trained by him, I decided I should be committed to the cause of the downtrodden including tribals and scheduled caste. He also told us to raise our voice for the eradication of inequalities wherever we are employed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/associates-in-trichy-say-fr-stan-swamy-left-lasting-impact-on-them/articleshow/84215877.cms||Gokul Rajendran

After thorough examination of his baggage, 407.90 grams of gold valued at Rs 19,90,552 has been seized. The said gold was concealed in a vacuum cleaner and in an incense electric burner. Further investigation is going on”, said an official of customs department. Last month, officials had seized 350 grams of gold from a passenger who landed from Dubai and in May another passenger coming from Sharjah was intercepted with the same amount of the precious metal. Officials claimed that due to the lockdown, smuggling of gold had reduced as flights were limited, but as restrictions are being eased, they anticipate more seizures in the coming days. The gold seizures had also shown that smugglers have now switched to new ways of getting the precious metal illegally from abroad in India. Officials claimed that while smugglers used electronic items earlier to smuggle the gold, now they convert the metal into a part of the product. Everything including sandals, iron, fountain pen and even human rectum are being used by smugglers to conceal gold in various forms, to smuggle into India. According to officials, those involved in smuggling of gold keep changing airports. In the past seizures, it was also found that carriers were paid a very measly amount for carrying the gold and were mostly working class people who were given a ticket to home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/400gm-gold-worth-rs-19l-seized-at-jaipur-airport/articleshow/84218307.cms||---

It was attended by Congress state president Ajay Kumar Lallu along with other senior leaders. All the block level heads attended the meet in which they were trained by a team of party experts from Chhattisgarh in six sessions spread over two days. Former Union minister, Pradeep Jain Aditya, informed TOI that the major aim of the training was to propagate among the party workers the ideology of the party since pre-independence era in the present day perspective. “In addition, they were also trained how to handle situations in the age of a vibrant social media,” he added. Talking to TOI, Lallu said, “We have a long and rich legacy and the training session will help in motivating party workers in view of the coming state assembly elections.” When asked how well Congress will be performing in the election, Lallu said, “Congress has emerged as an important opposition party in the state. We have been continuously fighting for the rights of dalits, minorities and the poor. We have also raised our voice on critical issues such as unemployment, poor law and order situation and mismanagement of Covid-19 pandemic. I am sure with the help of people of UP our party will emerge like a wave in the forthcoming elections.” The training culminated in the shape of a procession in which party workers were seen singing patriotic songs, a tradition Congress has been following during all its training sessions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/cong-workshop-to-motivate-party-workers-ends-in-jhansi/articleshow/84184982.cms||---

The panel will work closely with government departments to identify the hiccups that stall development projects, and offer solutions to boost the economic activity in the district.The trade body said that the district has not realised the progress that should have been ideally made in developing transport connectivity and industrial infrastructure. Like-minded entrepreneurs including real estate developers, hoteliers and industrialists expressed their willingness to be a part of a panel to steer infrastructure growth, and CII Trichy zone has formed the infrastructure panel. “Business scenario in Trichy is quite dull if we compare it with the western Tamil Nadu. Our plan is to organise like-minded people to promote Trichy’s image as an investment destination and address the demands in key sectors to improve the quality of life,” Dr D Senguttuvan, chairman, CII Trichy zone told TOI.As a dedicated professional panel utilising the expertise of premier institutes such as IIM Trichy and NIT Trichy was missing, CII said that the new panel will serve as a link between elected representatives, bureaucrats and investors to promote decentralised economic activity.“The demand in Trichy’s real estate sector establishes a huge potential for office space in the IT sector. We will invite IT majors to launch their offices here. Such investments will generate employment opportunities in the ITES sector too,” S Anand, real estate developer and head of Trichy infrastructure panel, said.Trichy was a frontrunner in national liveability and cleanliness charts until 2018. CII Trichy said that organising like-minded people from different sectors is essential for accelerating the growth. The panel will frequently conduct stakeholders meetings to invite ideas from the experts to propose development plans and business models for the government to enhance the image of Trichy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cii-launches-trichy-infrastructure-committee-to-attract-investment/articleshow/84215936.cms||Deepak Karthik

Around 50% of infections reported at workplaces have come from MGNREGA sites in Trichy district. Workers are being screened at the 2,210 ongoing worksites under the scheme in all the 404 village panchayats in the district. The health department is lifting swabs from workers to prevent the sites from becoming clusters. As per the statistics revealed by the district administration, six MGNREGA worksites have reported 19 cases between June 27 and July 3. Among the 38 bulk cases (two or more cases at a worksite) reported, MGNREGA sites topped the chart followed by industries and ITES offices that reported 12 positive cases in the corresponding period. Three cases were reported at a police station, while four cases at a hospital. Chettimangalam, Valavanthi, Kallur, Maradi, Thulaiyanatham and Muthalamman Kovilpatti were the villages where MGNREGA workers tested positive for Covid-19. Officials said that although the work locations are irrigation and water management projects in an open environment, the workers may spread the infection to others, while having food together. As workers may travel from one village to another for work or personal reasons, the spread could cause a cluster, officials said. “Special impetus is given at worksites as the lockdown restrictions were relaxed. We are collecting samples from workers at MGNREGA worksites, and positive cases were isolated soon as we received the result. The cases were identified only because of the special screening,” a senior official in the health department said. Each of the MGNREGA worksites has at least 100-120 workers with 90% of them women. Although the beneficiaries were selected based on their village falling within 5km of the work location, the movement between villages is prevalent among the workers. “All of those tested positive at six locations last week have recovered. We are continuing the intensive screening. Suspending the work will impact the beneficiaries since there is a need for wages offered,” R Shankar, project director, DRDA Trichy, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/mgnrega-worksites-turn-hotspots-in-trichy-district/articleshow/84216011.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Lucknow||No factual error in Javed Akhtar’s speech on Dilip Kumar||LUCKNOW: Way back in 2002 I received a call from eminent Urdu writer, poet, lyricist and editor Hasan Kamaal that he had come to Lucknow along with actor Dilip Kumar and writer-lyricist Javed Akhtar and they had checked into hotel Taj. When I went to the hotel, Hasan Kamaal saab and Javed Akhtar were involved in a discussion on Urdu language which had adopted many words from Persian and Arabic languages. I was enjoying the high profile discussion between two prominent writers and lyricists who were famous in the country and abroad. Meanwhile, Dilip Kumar saab, who was staying in the adjacent room, complained that he was feeling a little bored and neglected. So it was decided that Hasan Kamaal saab and Javed Akhtar should join him. They asked me to join them too and listen to Dilip Kumar saab and his poetry. The veteran actor was to be felicitated the next day (in hotel Taj) in which Javed Akhtar had to read his paper on the thespian. What happened in Dilip Kumar saab’s room for the next three hours are the most memorable moments of my life. When I was introduced to him as a journalist and former bureau chief of Blitz news magazine, Dilip saab became very happy as he had been very close to Blitz editor RK Karanjia. Dilip saab said he would take my test. The announcement came as a surprise to me. The legendary actor asked me to mention the latest news which would come on news channels in the evening and on the front pages of newspapers next morning. I said the news of the day was the appointment of Salman Khurshid as UP congress chief. Since Dilip saab had been campaigning for the Congress in UP and other parts of the country, he also made some observations about Khurshid’s appointment. Dilip saab then spoke to Javed Akhtar who was to read his paper on the personality and achievements of the thespian. “Javed saab kal sab log mujhko dekhne aayenge aur aapko sunne aayenge (Javed saab, tomorrow people will come to see me and listen to you),” the veteran actor observed. Dilip Kumar was very conscious of the fact that Javed Akhtar should be factually correct in his speech. He said nobody should be able to find any fault in the contents of Javed Akhtar’s paper. Over the next two and a half hours, Dilip saab gave a narration on his life — from his early days to his career in Bollywood, his directors and heroines. In between, Javed Akhtar diligently made notes. Hasan Kamal saab, Javed Akhtar and I were mesmerized by the narration of the Bollywood thespian who was the ‘Badshah’ of Indian films. Dilip saab also told me about his fondness for Tunde kababs and that he never missed savouring them during his stay in Lucknow.

A division bench comprising justices K Vinod Chandran and Ziyad Rahman AA considered a petition (WP-Crl. 142/2021) filed by Gilbert PT of Iritty in Kannur, who had stated in the petition that he is a Roman Catholic and a member of CPM. The court dismissed the petition after the woman told the court that she converted to Islam on her own free will and was not coerced by anybody. She was repeatedly asked by the court, both in the presence of police personnel and counsels and after removing them, about coercion but she denied any such intervention as alleged by the petitioner. The petition had stated that people with links to SDPI or PFI abducted his wife and son from their home at Thenhipalam in Malappuram and got them converted at Tarbiyathul Islam Sabha at Kozhikode. The petition also cited reports of new converts being recruited to ISIS from Kerala. During the interaction with the court, the woman, who is the sister of the petitioner’s wife, said the petitioner was not taking care of her and that theirs was not a legally valid marriage. She got converted on her own and her son has not been converted, she asserted. A police officer, who probed the incident, also told the court that the woman and the petitioner were living together but differences cropped up and they have been living separately. She got converted while working in a bakery, the court was told. Responding to the court’s query for the second time whether she has any fear or apprehension, the woman said her son’s studies are being frequently interrupted by outsiders and media. The court said it can perfectly understand this as columns appeared in media with the innuendo that the mother and the child are in the custody of extremists as soon as the bench issued notice in the case for producing them before the court, as is the usual procedure in habeas cases. Such outbursts, without verifying the ground reality, only results in polarization of communities, which the society cannot afford, the bench said. The court then directed police to take immediate action if the woman files a complaint so as to ensure that the woman and the child are not harassed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/habeas-corpus-hc-junks-plea/articleshow/84216029.cms||---

The state government in May had requested CBI for transfer of the investigation, after several leaders of both the Congress and the BJP raised suspicions over the circumstances leading to Prajapat’s death. Based on the state government’s recommendation, the agency took over the case. Barmer police in their FIR had claimed that at 7.50pm on April 22, deputy SP(DSP) Pushpendra Adha, had received in formation from Barmer SP that fugitive Kamlesh Prajapat, wanted for attacking an SHO in Pali, was hiding in Vishnu Colony. Barmer police organised a team comprising several armed cops drawn from multiple units. The team arrived at Prajapat’s Vishnu Colony house where they took positions at different places. Barmer police claimed that they had searched Prajapat’s house and recovered narcotic drugs, arms, ammunition, and Rs 56 lakh in cash. Police filed an FIR, number 136/2021 under different sections of the IPC. The FIR has now been transferred to the CBI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cbi-takes-over-drug-peddler-prajapats-encounter-case/articleshow/84218348.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur cops not in pink of health||JAIPUR: A health analysis of cops undertaken by city police has found that several of its members were suffering from hypertension, blood pressure, and weight-related issues. Jaipur police examined about 10,000 cops of whom 2,260 were found to be suffering from hypertension. Among them, 71 cops have been categorized to be under the “crisis” category of hypertension. The report states that the head-constables and assistant sub inspectors (ASI) were suffering more from the severe grade of hypertension. Jaipur police officials said for the past several months they had been organising health camps at different police stations to understand health related problems of the cops posted at different thanas. “The mandate of police duty is such that stress and prolonged hours of work begin to take a toll on the health of the staff. These health-related reports give early signs of disease and help provide timely treatment,” an official said. The report also indicates a high level of blood sugar amongst constables to inspectors. Over 500 cops were diagnosed with blood sugar hovering above 160. The BMI (body mass index) further points to the condition under which city police have to operate. The BMI health card found 3,380 cops up to the rank of Additional SP (ASP) to be overweight. There were 209 cops who were category 1 obese because their BMI score was between 31 and 35, similarly, nine cops scored above 36 on the BMI index and therefore considered to be category 2 obese. As per the report, hypertension is proportional to BMI, and the ASIs and circle inspectors (CI) were at a higher risk of hypertension. An inspector posted at a police station in the city said that stress and lifestyle-related diseases are inevitable for cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/city-cops-not-in-pink-of-health/articleshow/84218353.cms||---

It is a way of suppressing the people’s right to protest.”The MP said the city police had been visiting the houses of members of various outfits early in the morning and summoning them to police station, stating they wanted to conduct an inquiry into their involvement in protests. “When they appear at police stations, cops demand them to submit a letter under Section 41 A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) that they would not involve any kind of protest henceforth.”Natarajan said police were misusing the CrPC section to suppress the voice of people that was guaranteed by the constitution.Receiving the petition, the city police commissioner informed them that the CrPC section was invoked mainly because of the pandemic situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mp-condemns-city-police-for-asking-outfits-not-to-protest/articleshow/84218397.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On Tuesday night, some miscreants had entered the beauty parlour of S Gangadevi near Somanur bus stand and robbed 18 sovereigns of gold jewellery from the woman.

---||Lucknow||Dilip Kumar & Lucknow: A blend of kebabs, philanthropy and poetry||LUCKNOW: It was the 1960s and Lucknow was struggling to keep its head above flood waters when superstar Dilip Kumar set foot in the city to raise help. The actor’s keen interest in poetry and culture naturally made way for a mushaira to be organised by the then literary circle. A fundraiser followed. The visits to Lucknow did not stop here. Over the next several decades, the popular actor kept coming back. In his own words, “Lucknow aakar meri zuban mai luknat aa jati hai (Coming to Lucknow and to speak in Urdu here brings a certain stutter to my tongue),” he had once remarked during a speech at Charbagh railway stadium. Peek from the past: Dilip Kumar clicked during his visits to the city whose language and grace always attracted him“In 1997, Dilip saab was the chief guest at the Muslim OBC Conference at Kaiserbagh Baradari. He was involved in raising awareness about the rights of the OBC community. In 1998, through Hindi-Urdu Sahitya Award Committee (HUSAC), he was awarded the Awadh Samman at Begum Hazrat Mahal park in association with Lucknow Municipal Corporation,” said poet Athar Nabi, who was the secretary of the Muslim OBC Conference in Lucknow and convener of HUSAC. Reminiscing the days, Nabi said, “His personality was such that most people who came to meet him would be spellbound and would not utter a word. Like others, I too would stare at him. He was a well-read person who had a command on English and Urdu literature.” A connoisseur of food, it was Tunday kebabs that Kumar almost always had on his plate when in Lucknow. The owners often sent it to him in Mumbai too. “Every time he was here, I was asked to bring in kebabs and parathas,” said Tundey Kababi proprietor Mohammad Usman. “Once we had organised an Awadhi food festival in Mumbai and had invited him there. Instead, he asked me to come over to his house and bring along platefuls of kebabs. I stayed at his house for over two hours, fed him and also offered namaz there!” he added. In the late 1970s, the actor donned the cap of a cricketer at KD Singh Babu Stadium, raising money for the chief minister’s relief fund. “Several actors were in his team which was named the Dilip Kumar Team and on the other side were Women 11, the UP Women’s Cricket Association team,” recalled Nabi. Former Lucknow University vice-chancellor Prof Roop Rekha Verma also recalled the instances of meeting the actor. “Activist Shabnam Hashmi was on a hunger strike at Gandhi statue against an incident of crime in the city. Dilip ji had come there to make Shabnam break her hunger strike. A few years later, at a Hindi-Urdu conference here, he regaled everyone with a funny anecdote from his first recording where he had to act out a romantic scene. Everyone was in splits at his oratory prowess,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-was-dear-to-mughal-e-azams-salim/articleshow/84220562.cms||Yusra Husain

---||Bengaluru||7 Karnataka districts report less than 30% vaccine coverage, red-flag supply||BENGALURU: In seven of Karnataka’s 30 districts, less than 30% of the eligible population has been administered at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine. Most of these districts are in north Karnataka, and authorities say availability, rather than hesitancy, is the issue. Officials said they are planning their vaccination sessions subject to their supply and not capacity. Vaccines provided from the state government have been fully utilised, they added. Haveri district is at the bottom of the heap, having covered just over 22% of the targeted population aged 18 years and above. The highest inoculation in the state is reported from Bengaluru Urban, which is inching towards 70%. “The problem is no more with vaccine hesitancy, especially in urban areas. We have no vaccines left,” said a district official in Davanagere, which has vaccinated 29.4% of the eligible population. Demand-supply gap hits vaccine drivesIn fact, after we started vaccinating college students, it has been tough to supply doses to health centres where the drive was going on for those aged 45 years and above.” Davangere gets its vaccine supply from Bengaluru via Chitradurga. While Davanagere has been supplied with 4.8 lakh doses so far, the district has in fact made use of 5.1 lakh doses, by achieving negative wastage. “The 11th dose of Covishield in each vial has been used without giving any scope for spillage. The healthcare workers have been trained in this regard and there is no vial opened unless there are enough beneficiaries at the spot waiting,” said a district official in Davanagere. The situation is no different from Haveri, which has received close to 3.3 lakh doses from the state as of July 6 but has managed to make use of nearly 3.5 lakh doses by utilising the 11th dose in vials. “There is no vaccine wastage now, unlike the scenario in January, when there was vaccine hesitancy. We plan the drives based on vaccine supply... though our capacity is to vaccinate more than 15,000 people a day, the supply has not been adequate,” said Dr Raghavendra HS, district health officer of Haveri. Supply has been skewed, hindering planning, especially when there is huge demand for vaccination, say health department officials. “The matter has been raised multiple times and elected representatives have taken it up too. But given the limited supply, we ensure that vaccination is done only in a few centres every day through the token system so as to avoid crowds,” said an official.

All the materials were manufactured at the factory and assembled at the construction site.The sheer size of the building and speed at which it was built have helped the structure find a place in the Elite World Records, Asian Records Academy, India Records Academy and Tamilan Book of Records as the “largest hospital building constructed by precast concrete technology in the shortest period”.The precast concrete technology is growing in popularity because of the spiralling construction and labour costs, constantly fluctuating prices of raw materials such as cement and steel, and unavailability of bricks. A growing number of contractors are opting for the precast technology for infrastructure projects like flyovers and government buildings.The hospital, which has two blocks that are connected to each other, is equipped with 401 beds, of which 201 have oxygen facilities. The remaining 200 beds are housed in the general ward. The district administration had permitted the contractor to continue with construction, despite the pandemic, as the building would come handy if there is a third wave.The precast concrete construction technology features structures made of wall slabs system with no columns or beams running through them. Builders say this will allow modifications and option to free space usage at any point of time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/erode-medical-college-hosp-building-sets-new-records/articleshow/84218449.cms||---

He conveyed his resolve through jottings made in the visitors’ book at Muthuvelar Noolagam-Anjugam Padippagam, two libraries in Thirukkuvalai functioning as a memorial of the parents of M Karunanidhi. Stalin was visiting his ancestral house in Nagapattinam district for the first time after taking charge as CM, on the second day of his visit to the delta districts. He wrote that he has become chief minister because of the efforts and hard work of Udanpirappugal (blood brothers in Tamil) as termed by his father. “Thalaivar Kalaignar (M Karunanidhi) will often say that post (chief minister) means responsibility. Should serve people with responsibility. Bearing that in mind, my journey will continue by treating chief ministership as a responsibility. This is the pledge I take at his (Karunanidhi) birthplace (house),” the CM wrote. En route to Thirukkuvalai, the CM received petitions from locals. He stopped by at Pinnavasal village to congratulate a newly married couple who was waiting for the convoy outside a wedding hall. Earlier in the day, he inaugurated the comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care (CEmONC) building at Tiruvarur government medical college hospital. The facility has 200 beds for maternal care and 50 for intensive neonatal care. The CM then felicitated district collector P Gayathri Krishnan for vaccinating all 2,334 residents against Covid-19 in Kattur village near Koradacherry town in Tiruvarur district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/chief-ministership-responsibility-pledges-stalin-at-ancestral-house/articleshow/84216129.cms||---

Since the promulgation of Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 in November last year, police have filed 63 FIRs and booked 162 people. A top police officer on Wednesday told TOI that seven cases out of the 63 were closed after no evidence was found against the accused. He rejected allegations that the state police was filing “frivolous cases”. The ordinance that became law in February 2021 prohibits anyone from converting or attempting to convert to another religion by inducement, marriage, coercion, etc. Additional director general of police (law and order) Prashant Kumar said, “It is wrong to say the law is being misused. We have instances where after investigations police did not find any reason to bring an alleged crime under the ambit of the new law.” Data provided by the office of ADG said 96 people have been arrested so far under the new law, and 80 are in jail. The rest are out on bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/80-in-jail-21-absconding-under-ups-love-jihad-law/articleshow/84213845.cms||Sandeep Rai

The body of Krishna Valmiki was taken to his hometown Jhalrapatan where the last rites had to be performed amid tight police security on Wednesday. The death led to protests in Jhalrapatan with Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal calling it a mob lynching, while police denied it. Police have already arrested six youths and booked them for murder under IPC Section 302. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal activists, however, demanded that the accused be charged for mob lynching, kin be given Rs 1 crore compensation and a government job for a member of the family. Jhalawar SP Kiran Kang Siddhu said the attack was a result of past enmity between two groups, which led to the attack on last Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gang-war-claims-life-of-youth-in-jhalawar/articleshow/84218447.cms||---

Block development officers will be given the training to operate the tap made of fibre. SATO tap has an enclosure where a water bottle can be placed in an inverted manner. A lever at the front side of the tap has to be pressed for washing hands. SCOPE, an NGO run by Padma Shri awardee M Subburaman, said that the SATO tap dispenses 200 ml of water every time the lever is pressed. The tap is portable and can be placed on any flat surface. Every time the lever is pressed, water will be dispensed as a small stream for about 10 seconds, giving adequate time for the user to wash their hands as prescribed by the UNICEF method. The water discharge will gradually come to a halt. “We initially planned to give the SATO taps produced by Japanese based LIXIL to schools. But as the schools are shut, we distributed them to the local bodies. A lot of water can be saved by using a SATO tap instead of the conventional taps,” Subburaman said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/ngo-donates-1500-sato-taps-in-trichy/articleshow/84216108.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Vigilance once again quizzes KM Shaji||Kozhikode: On Wednesday, vigilance and anti-corruption bureau (VACB) questioned former IUML MLA KM Shaji again in connection with a case registered against him for allegedly amassing assets disproportionate to his known sources of income. Sources said alleged inconsistencies in the details he had submitted about his sources of income before the sleuths had led to him being questioned again. He was questioned for three hours on Wednesday and Shaji left the VACB office in Kozhikode without responding to the media. In April, VACB had conducted simultaneous raids at his homes in Kozhikode and Kannur. VACB had seized Rs 47,35,500 from Shaji’s house at Manalil in Kannur apart from gold ornaments weighing 535g and 77 documents. Shaji had said that he had documents to prove the source of the money seized from his residence and that he was ready to produce it before any investigation agency. After he was questioned by VACB in April, Shaji had told the media that he had records to prove the source of the money which was collected from the public for election purposes, including minutes of meeting, counterfoil, receipts, etc. Shaji had said that he hadn’t completed payments for election expenses and added that the money seized by VACB, included part of the over Rs 30 lakh that he had the right to spend for his election campaign. He had said that he kept the money at his Kannur residence as he had documents to provide its source. Shaji added that VACB returned the gold and a few foreign currencies after the raid. VACB had registered a case against Shaji after a preliminary inquiry found that he had amassed wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income from 2011 to 2020 by a margin of 166%. The inquiry was based on a petition by advocate MR Harish before the court of enquiry commissioner and special judge, Kozhikode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/vigilance-once-again-quizzes-km-shaji/articleshow/84216424.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thane||Maharashtra: Several districts with high positivity going slack in contact tracing||Some districts in the state reporting higher than average Covid positivity rates are coming up short in contact tracing for every confirmed case. Maharashtra currently traces an average of 16 persons for every patient. But some key districts and regions — including Pune, Nagpur, Ahmednagar and Kolhapur which have higher positivity rates than the state average of 4.5% — are doing less. In Pune district, for example, authorities track an average of just 13 close contacts per case State health minister Rajesh Tope has said contact tracing — of high and low-risk contacts — should be above 20. Officials from the public health department said they have asked all local authorities to step up surveillance, given the threat from the Delta variant, which is proving more infectious. The Centre, too, had called for adequate tracing, testing and isolation. “Increasing tracing of both high-risk and low-risk contacts is very important. There should not be any setback in the numbers being traced,” said a health ministry official. According to data shared by the state public health department, only Thane and Latur are currently tracing a good number of contacts, at an average of 23 and 46 persons (the highest), respectively. The health department’s data shows most state districts are tracing fewer than the average of 16 close contacts per patient --- 6 high risk and 10 low risk. Officials said the ideal number should be more than 20, to ensure clusters are stopped from forming. State task force members said tracking and testing of contacts is vital for Covid containment. “Contact tracing should be enhanced to 1:30 and 1:50. The current numbers are very poor. We cannot be lethargic on this front,” said task force member Dr Shashank Joshi. Members said examples such as Kolhapur, with a high positivity rate despite increased vaccination coverage, mean authorities have to watch out for breakthrough infections — Covid after inoculation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-several-dists-with-high-vity-going-slack-in-contact-tracing/articleshow/84223544.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Student organization Coimbatore Covid Aid and NGO Coodu had organized a free vaccination camp for 260 underprivileged people at Kavundampalayam on Tuesday with the permission from the district collector and department of medical services. While the health department provided them Covishield, a team of doctors and nurses from KGM Hospital inoculated the beneficiaries. “We will take care of their second doses as well. We have plans to extend the programme to other targeted communities in the coming weeks,” said Tavissi Jain, one of the founders of Coimbatore Covid Aid. Meanwhile, the city corporation has begun enumeration of people with comorbidities within its limits. Officials are going door-to-door to put a number on vulnerable people to better plan for the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/covid-19-cases-fall-to-385-291-recover/articleshow/84218479.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh government ensured industries ran smoothly during Covid, says minister Sidharth Nath Singh||LUCKNOW: During the two Covid waves, the state government did not allow industries to suffer and provided them with every possibility facility to ensure their smooth operations, said MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh. UP also recently earned praise from PM Narendra Modi for industrial development, who said that the impact of UP’s policies was being witnessed by small towns and villages as well. The MSME minister said that efforts were made to keep industries running for most part of the pandemic. “During the first wave, district MSME officers were in constant touch with industries to ensure smooth functioning of the sector, primarily those units which were related to essential goods. Industrial activity, including IT and IT enabled services, were allowed to operate from April 20. In the second wave, all industrial units were allowed to operate during the curfew hours,” said Singh. An official from the department said that there were also no restrictions on movement of workers and to ease matters further for them, they were not required to apply for any passes but could just show their ID cards or letters from organisations. During the first wave, the official said, the government helped in setting up 53 PPE manufacturing units with a capacity of 50,000 kits per day and 40 new units for manufacturing of sanitisers. The power department also waived fixed charges for the industrial sector and gave a further 15% rebate on power usage. The minister said the government was also sensitive to the problems being faced by industries. For instance, when the Indian Industries Association pointed out that production and maintenance were affected due to lack of transport facilities because of which raw material was not being able to reach plants, the government allowed transportation of all such essential materials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-ensured-industries-ran-smoothly-during-covid-min/articleshow/84220584.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Agra||Former sub-inspector and Agra MP SP Singh Baghel gets ministerial berth||Agra: A sub-inspector in UP police, a professor of military science and a five-time member of parliament, Satya Pal Singh Baghel has donned many hats in his career, but the 61-year-old’s “biggest achievement” came on Wednesday as he was inducted into the Union council of ministers.“I’m thankful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for providing me the opportunity to serve the people of the country in a better way. This is the happiest moment of my life and my biggest achievement yet. I will not leave any stone unturned in doing justice to whatever portfolio is assigned to me,” the BJP MP from Agra told TOI. Baghel, who hails from Auraiya district, is known for his oratory as much as he is known for his party hopping. He was a member of the Lok Sabha in 1998, 1999 and 2004 as a Samajwadi Party MP and represented the Jalesar seat. In 2009, Baghel joined Bahujan Samaj Party and was elected to the Rajya Sabha as a BSP nominee.But in 2014, Baghel resigned as BSP Rajya Sabha MP after contesting and losing Lok Sabha elections from Firozabad. Soon after, he aligned himself with the BJP. In 2015, he was appointed the president of BJP OBC Morcha. In 2017, he won the assembly elections from Tundla seat and served as a minister (animal husbandry) in Yogi Adityanath’s cabinet. In 2019, he was fielded by the BJP from the Agra Lok Sabha seat (SC) — replacing the incumbent Ram Shankar Katheria, the then chief of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes. Baghel managed to notch a major victory, defeating the BSP candidate Manoj Kumar Soni by over two lakh votes.Back in the 90s, however, the local intelligence unit (LIU) sleuth had few political aspirations. He had joined UP Police as sub-inspector soon after completing his MSc. It was only when he was serving as a security officer to former chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav that his political ambitions started taking shape. He took voluntary retirement from police in 1993 and was appointed the state president of Samajwadi Party’s youth brigade. A PhD in military science, Baghel is also a professor at Agra College. Baghel’s political career, however, hasn’t remained free of controversy. A case is pending in court against him after it was alleged that he had contested elections on a forged caste certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/former-sub-inspector-and-agra-mp-sp-singh-baghel-gets-ministerial-berth/articleshow/84211568.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP executive meet timed after rural polls||LUCKNOW: UP BJP plans to convene its much-awaited state executive meeting next week, timing it with the conclusion of block chairman elections for a macro and micro analysis of the ruling party’s political position on the ground and its grip on the vast rural swathes in the run-up to assembly elections next year. Sources said, the state leadership has reached out to party national president J P Nadda to virtually address the meeting in what could set the party’s organisational machinery in motion to begin the spade work for the crucial 2022 state polls. While official date is yet to be announced, sources said the meeting may be called any time after July 13. The meeting is expected to lay a formal template of the party’s electoral course to take on a belligerent opposition, mainly Samajwadi Party, which has been flexing its political muscle to push BJP to the wall on a host of issues, including alleged mismanagement of the pandemic’s second wave. Having swept the zila panchayat chairman elections, the BJP, experts say, has already armed its organisational machinery to neutralize the opposition narrative and scale up its footprints in rural areas, which determine electoral prospects of any political party. The party, sources said, plans to further spur its cadres after rural local bodies elections are over. The state executive will also come after Wednesday’s rejig in the Narendra Modi cabinet, which has a host of party leaders from UP to signal its political message visa-vis caste and regional arithmetic. The last state executive was organised on March15 in Lucknow, months ahead of panchayat elections, which saw BJP announcing its candidates, triggering a political frenzy in the opposition camp. The meet was then addressed by Union defence minister and Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh and CM Yogi Adityanath. Before that, UP BJP state executive was held in Meerut in August 2018 during the tenure of then state president and Chandauli MP Mahendra Nath Pandey. This also assumed political relevance in wake of the 2019 Lok sabha elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-state-executive-timed-after-rural-polls/articleshow/84220613.cms||Pankaj Shah

The first-of-its-kind project in Vidarbha, the hospital being developed in RTMNU’s new administrative building will also have dedicated oxygen plant to ensure no shortage in projected third wave. Tiwari said in a press conference, “NMC has completed civil works. Due to the initiative of leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, National Cancer Institute (NCI) has procured all machinery related to paediatric Covid patients and will start supplying it to NMC for installation soon. It is part of the arrangements for projected third wave.” NMC deputy municipal commissioner Milind Meshram told TOI, “NCI also supplied machinery related to pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plant and related works have started at the hospital. Therefore, there will be no issue of oxygen supply. NCI is procuring equipment worth over Rs7 crore, of which it has already handed over material costing Rs1.56 crore to NMC.” TOI was the first to report about proposed Paediatric Covid Hospital on June 3. Meshram added, “Hospital will have 12 paediatricians, 24 MBBS doctors, 200 nurses, seven oxygen operators, one medical superintendent, three pharmacists, 72 ward boys and other staff. We have requested NCI to bear the cost of manpower if possible. Along with other civil works, NMC will lay oxygen line costing around Rs1 crore,” he said. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi had proposed the project when they came to know about new administrative building of RTMNU. The hospital has been developed on first, second and third floor with 20-bed NICU and some of the 148 oxygenated beds on first floor, 32-bed PICU on second floor with some oxygenated beds, and remaining beds on third floor. Departments for 0-5-year-old children, 5-10 and 10-15 year old kids will be separate. Radiology centre, pathology and pharmacy will be facilitated. Tiwari also said, “LCD will be provided for entertainment of children in all departments, with paintings on wall and play equipment. Some 50 beds will be provided for parents too.” Tiwari said, “We plan to start Mother Milk Bank for children hit due to the pandemic and others at NMC Pachpaoli Hospital and procure 1,000 jumbo cylinders before projected third wave. To mark 75th Independence Year, 75 Vande Mataram Health Posts are being developed, of which few will be started on August 15. Target is to increase testing to 15,000 per day as against existing 5,000 per day.” He added, “I completed six months as mayor and always avoided political statements. Only motive is to end the pandemic together. But I want to say we would not be able to face the public if Union minister Nitin Gadkari had not resolved the oxygen issues of the district and various initiatives were not taken by Fadnavis during the second wave. Therefore, we are leaving no stone unturned for projected third wave.” Tiwari said, “Some 45% eligible people have taken the first dose in the city. We are equipped to give doses to all eligible population as soon as possible. The state government should ensure sufficient supply. I have proposed to procure doses and ensure 100% vaccination of the city. But the government did not allow.” Tiwari announced 31 projects and claimed all will be completed in his remaining tenure. Asked whether projects like beautification of 75 squares, gardens etc are important in pandemic, Tiwari said, “Majority of projects do not require funds from NMC as legislators, NGOs and corporates will fund them. Some projects are proposed to mark 75th Independence Year. People do not know about contribution of some freedom fighters of the city. Next generation should come to know about the role of martyrs, Param Veer Chakra winners etc. Therefore, these projects are being planned without affecting preparations for pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/paediatric-covid-hospital-to-start-in-july-3rd-week/articleshow/84213875.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

We had increased vigilance in the area.” Bhomia said, ATS additional SP Om Prakash Ujjawal led a team which raided Ramsar Gadra area and recovered 22 packets of heroin. Four accused have been taken into custody. They have been identified as Deravar Singh Sodha, Kalu Singh Sodha, Khet Singh Sodha and Devi Singh. The accused are being interrogated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/22kg-heroin-smuggled-from-pak-seized-by-ats-4-detained/articleshow/84218491.cms||---

The arrest was made on Tuesday and the details emerged on Wednesday. Crime branch officers said that the accused, Amit Abhawekar, 24, was caught in Mandvi ni Pol in Astodia and jewellery worth Rs 26 lakh was recovered from him. “Abhawekar identified the eatery at Chhani Jakatnaka where traders from Rajkot and other places stop for refreshments after visiting Vadodara,” said a crime branch officer. “His accomplices were Manoj Sindhi, Uttam Atmaram, Vishal Tamanche, Boby Rathod, and Sunny Tamanche.” The criminals plotted easy escape on three different vehicles: an SUV, a motorcycle, and a scooter. The ploy made it difficult to even identify them, said the officer. The officer said that the accused targeted Vipul Dhakan and others after noticing them stop at a ganthia shop. The accused broke the windowpane on the driver’s side of the targeted vehicle. Then they opened the boot of the car where the jewellery was stored. The accused took away jewellery weighing about 5.75kg and fled in different directions to evade arrest. Abhawekar returned to Ahmedabad as he had failed to sell the jewellery elsewhere. “He was negotiating with a city-based jeweller, but the city crime branch got an input that he was spotted in the Astodia area,” the officer said. “The cops caught him with the jewellery.” The officer said that the other accused who have taken their share of the booty are still at large. The complainant, Dhakan, had arrived in Vadodara city on June 16 with his salesman Jalpesh Lathigara and driver Praful Dangar. They had brought jewellery weighing about 5.75kg worth Rs 2.35 crore. They later went to a shop in Alkapuri and sold about 850gm of the jewellery before checking into a hotel. On June 18, they left for Rajkot and it was Dangar who suggested that they have ganthia at an eatery near Chhani Jakatnaka. The complainant placed the jewellery bags in the car’s boot. When they were having paan masala after eating snacks, someone told them that their car’s boot was open. Some locals told Dhakan that two men on a motorbike had broken into the car.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rs-2-35cr-jewellery-loot-cracked-1-held/articleshow/84216221.cms||---

The public hearing scheduled to begin at 10am will be held in both physical and online mode. Entry inside the venue will be restricted to registered participants only, it was informed. Those participants who have registered online for the hearing will be issued tokens at one of the counters set up at the venue. There will be another check for the token-holders before being admitted inside the venue, official sources said. For those who have registered for the virtual mode, a link will be sent to the participants according to their turns. In case there’s no response from the participant after two calls, the next speaker will be called out. Arrangements have been done for spot registration of participants. Every participant will be given 15 minutes to make their submissions. Two experts from the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), as well as a team of experts from State Coastal Zone Management Authority (CZMA) will be present for the hearing. The event will be held by maintaining Covid-appropriate behaviour. “No entry will be given to those without masks, and social distancing will have to be followed,” a GCZMA official said. Traffic police have also drawn up a plan for smooth flow of traffic along the roads leading to the venue. The SGPDA market complex will remain closed on Thursday and Friday, as per an order issued by the South Goa collector under section 144 of Cr PC “in the interest of public safety and to avoid law and order situation, and to keep a strict vigil on the entry and exit of people attending the hearing.” However, fish sellers and traders, enraged over barricading of the entrance to the SGPDA market by the police, on Wednesday removed the barricades and demanded that the market be allowed to remain open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/south-goa-officials-review-preps-for-hearing/articleshow/84218507.cms||---
---||Agra||Ten months on, Agra administration fails to make 132 ponds encroachment free||AGRA: Agra district administration has failed in its effort to make 132 ponds spread across the district — with 13 being in the city itself — encroachment free, the direction for which was given by the Allahabad high court in September 2020. Taking strict cognisance of a Public Interest Litigation (PIL), which brought to its notice that 139 ponds have been encroached upon by erecting temporary and permanent structures such as shops, residences and lodges, the court had directed the UP chief secretary and the Agra district administration to make ponds free from encroachments and revive them to the status of 1952. Following the court’s direction, district magistrate Prabhu N Singh had constituted a committee headed by additional district magistrate (finance and revenue) Yogendra Kumar to execute the HC order. In the past ten months, however, the district administration has failed to remove the encroachments. According to revenue records, there are a total of 3,747 ponds spread over 867.63 hectares in Agra district and a majority of them have dried up. The administration has set a target to revive the ponds before the onset of monsoon. According to officials, the Covid-19 pandemic hampered the revival work. Notices were, however, issued to the people who had illegally erected temporary or permanent structures on the ponds’ land, they said. Accusing the district administration’s lackadaisical approach responsible for the encroachments on the waterbodies, petitioner Suresh Chand Soni alleged that despite the court order, the administration failed to take any concrete action to revive these ponds in the past 10 months. “We will file a review application before the high court to ensure a time-bound action for the conservation of the waterbodies,” added Soni. Additional district magistrate (finance and revenue) Yogendra Kumar said, “The second Covid-19 wave hit the pond revival work. Out of the 139 ponds, where the encroachments were identified, land of seven ponds has been retained. Besides, several cases of encroachments on ponds are pending in local courts. A report has been sought from sub-divisional magistrates on the status of these cases. The work on the revival of ponds will be expedited soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/10-months-on-agra-admin-fails-to-make-132-ponds-encroachment-free/articleshow/84213879.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Delhi||Delhi gets genome sequencing facility, to help govt analyse Covid-19 variants||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated a SARS CoV2 genome sequencing facility at the genetic laboratory of Lok Nayak Hospital on Wednesday, the third such facility in north India. It will help the government identify and analyse all Covid-19 variants in preparation of future resurgences and also enable advance plans to avert infection and loss of human lives. Delhi has depended on the National Centre for Disease Control, a central government laboratory, to get the capital’s samples tested. The genome sequencing is important due to frequent emergence of variants of the novel coronavirus. Kejriwal said Delhi government had purchased a genetic analyser machine for genome sequencing. “With this machine, we will be able to analyse all the variants of Covid and understand them for any future waves in Delhi. If we get to learn about the variant in time, we will be able to strategise our preparations and take the right actions. We did not have any such facility until today,” he said. The genome sequencer facility will be an asset not only for Delhi but for the entire northern India. Kejriwal said Delhiites would benefit from this machine and congratulated Lok Nayak Hospital medical director Dr Suresh Kumar and his team for getting it ready in a short span. The coronavirus is notorious for mutating and in such circumstances, it would significantly help to know about the circulating viral strains so contact tracing can be done to check the infection. The AAP government will start the SARS CoV2 genome sequencing facility at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Services on Thursday as a part of Delhi government’s preparations to tackle a possible resurgence of Covid in the capital. This newly acquired machine is able to sequence 5-7 samples in a day with a turnaround time of 4-5 days. This facility will be mainly for surveillance and public health purposes with the identification of any variant of concern. It is being set up to aid and address the larger public interest considering the case fatality and re-emergence of Covid due to different SARS CoV2 strains. The CM also appealed to all citizens to strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour to check the spread of the deadly coronavirus that has claimed the lives of over 25,000 Delhiites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/genome-lab-to-help-analyse-covid-variants/articleshow/84216267.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Agra||Agra: Heat wave draws out reptiles||AGRA: A five-foot long Indian rat snake was found in an air cooler at a marriage hall in Pushpa Farm, Dayalbagh, Agra, on Monday. The reptile had apparently taken refuge in the cooler to get respite from the scorching heat. The Wildlife SOS rescuers carefully extricated the snake and transferred it to a snake bag. A few kilometres away in Mathura, a five-foot-long cobra and an Indian wolf snake shocked occupants of a house in Piproth village located in Raipura Jat. Both the snakes were found resting between the grooves of a brick boundary wall and were safely rescued by the Wildlife SOS team. This was followed by a call about another wolf snake that was spotted in the garden of a house in Police Line, Agra. The NGO also rescued a monitor lizard from the kitchen sink of a house in Prem Nagar located in Rajpur Chungi, Agra. The rescued reptiles were kept under observation for a few hours and later released back into their natural habitat. Baiju Raj M.V, director, conservation projects, Wildlife SOS, said, “Reptile sightings increase during the summer season. So, we request people to report any such incident on our helpline. In the past week alone, we have responded to over 18 such calls.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/heat-wave-draws-out-reptiles/articleshow/84213881.cms||---

An investigation officer said they have nabbed the accused, 40-year-old Kanagarathnam, a resident of Kamaraj Nagar in the hill town, based on a complaint from his 35-year-old wife Anusuya. The officer said Kanagarathinam was a habitual drunkard and he used to pick up frequent quarrels with his wife in an inebriated condition. “When Kanagarathnam came home drunk a day ago, another quarrel ensued with his wife, who objected to his daily drinking habit. Kanagarathnam insisted that he would not give up drinking and asked Anusuya to leave the house, if she could not put up with him,” the officer said. When she refused and attempted to pacify him, the officer said, Kanagarathinam took a knife and threatened to stab their son Karanraj, if she did not leave home. “As she continued to remain there, he stabbed the boy, who was admitted to Valparai government hospital. Doctors say his condition is showing signs of improvement,” the officer said. Meanwhile, Anusuya went to police station and lodged a complaint against her husband. Police subsequently registered a case and arrested Kanagarathinam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/angered-with-wife-drunk-man-stabs-11-yr-old-son/articleshow/84218508.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||ATS to raise all-woman squad for spl ops||Lucknow: A special all-women police squad is set to come up in the state. The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (UP ATS) will raise the first-of-its-kind all-women squad called Special Police Operation Team (SPOT). A specialised unit trained to tackle anti-hijacking and counter-insurgency operations like terror attacks, SPOT has a batch of commandos trained by expert trainers of BSF, CISF, ITBP and other paramilitary forces. A senior officer at UP ATS said that a proposal has been sent to the government for approval and budgeting after discussion with home department officials. One unit would have 58 personnel including a dog squad, a bomb disposal squad and a wireless trapping unit. The officer said that the idea was based on increasing representation of women at workplaces and their deployment at sensitive locations. Carrying out rescue operations and tackling women troublemakers would also be easier with this. Recently, on the directions of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, for the first time, the process to raise three all-women battalions had also begun. ADG, law and order, Prashant Kumar said that a proposal has also been sent to the government to raise more units of SPOT in Varanasi, Agra, Kheri, and Shravasti. IG, ATS, GK Goswamy said that SPOT would also perform security surveys in peacetime and train special weapons advanced tactics teams of district police. SPOT is a specialised unit of ATS. The first unit raised in 2018 comprised men only. SPOT has an exclusive training centre in Sarojininagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ats-to-raise-all-woman-squad-for-spl-ops/articleshow/84220641.cms||---
---||Lucknow||CBI chargesheet against rlys medical officer, her husband||Lucknow: The Lucknow unit of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday filed a charge sheet before a special CBI court against former divisional medical officer (DMO), Dr Sunita Gupta, and her husband Dr Rajeev Gupta, a professor in radiotherapy department of KGMU, in connection with a disproportionate assets case. According to the chargesheet, Dr Sunita Gupta and her husband allegedly amassed unaccounted assets worth Rs 1.59 crore, and her husband was found to have abetted the alleged offence. CBI’s anti-corruption branch had lodged the FIR against the couple on May 23, 2019. A complaint against Dr Sunita Gupta was lodged with the CBI in 2016 by the then deputy chief vigilance officer of Northern Railways, Vinod Kumar. CBI officials said Rs 1.59 crore was recovered during searches at the residential premises of Dr Sunita Gupta in Charbagh while Rs 9.43 lakh was found in her locke. “Scrutiny of documents seized during searches revealed that major acquisition of immovable assets was made by the couple after January 1, 2009, which continued till 2016,” a senior CBI official, privy to the investigation, said. The probe revealed that the couple had over 86% more assets than their known sources of income. CBI also claimed that papers and expenditure incurred on the construction of plot by the doctor couple at Ratan Khand in Shardanagar, Lucknow, along with money spent on children’s education were not found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cbi-chargesheet-against-rlys-medical-officer-her-husband/articleshow/84220673.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||BEd student brightens up slum kids’ future||Coimbatore: A second year BEd student in the city has become a ray of hope for the 25 school students of a slum that is located just off Keeranatham Road at Saravanampatti. Every day, the government school students gather on one of Kandasamy Nagar’s widest streets around 6.20pm to revise the online classes and get doubts cleared by their tutor Manikandan, who engages them classes free of cost. The graduate student has requested the city corporation to provide them with a proper building with electricity. Manikandan, whose mother is also a tuition teacher, was first approached by Vivekananda Seva Kendram to take free tuitions for the slum children when he was pursuing BSc Botany at the Government Arts College. “Since I was free in the evenings, I agreed,” he said. Manikandan soon realized that the dropout rate in the area was extremely high, with many of them quitting studies even before Class X. “They did not understand what was taught and hence they could not do their homework or perform well in tests and exams. As a result, their interest in studies weaned and stopped going to schools. So, I decided to reduce the school dropout rate by helping them understand the lessons, do their homework their own and perform well in exams,” Manikandan said. He has been teaching them for the past four years and none of them have dropped out during the period. A couple of his students have made it into classes XI and XII as well. “Most of the students attending the tuition are from Class I to X,” Manikandan said. Now that the lockdown restricts are relaxed, Manikandan has restarted the tuitions by following all the Covid19 protocols including wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing. “The students need extra support now more than ever, because they hardly understand 30% of what is taught online,” he said. Manikandan has requested the city corporation to provide him with a room in a new or existing building, with electricity connection - so that they could have lights, fans and a plug point to fix a projector to stream innovative educational videos. “Presently, they study under streetlights. We face mosquito menace and can’t have tuition classes whenever it rains. If there is a proper building, we can play free educational videos from Byjus, making learning simpler and more fun for students,” the BEd student said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/bed-student-brightens-up-slum-kids-future/articleshow/84218561.cms||---
---||Delhi||Lungs, liver, kidneys: Covid hurts them most||NEW DELHI: After the lungs, the liver and kidneys are the most affected in patients with severe Covid-19. This has been confirmed by a study conducted at AIIMS, which involved examining tissue samples taken from different organs of 37 patients who succumbed to the disease. The doctors found cardiac involvement was much lower than anticipated. “Further research is on to understand how the virus affects different organs. It will help us strategise how to treat patients and also throw light on potential post-Covid complications,” a senior doctor who participated in the study told TOI. Initially, it was thought that Covid-19 was essentially a respiratory infection that mainly affected the lungs, but it was later revealed that multiple organs were affected. Dr Naveet Wig, the corresponding author of the study, told TOI that their analysis had reconfirmed that the lung was the most affected organ in severe Covid-19 cases. Asked about the damage seen in tissue samples of liver and kidneys, he added that some changes could have been caused by underlying diseases. Examination of tissue samples revealed that 78% of the deceased patients had acute injury in the lungs, 37.5% had associated bronchopneumonia, pneumonia that causes inflammation in the tiny, balloon-shaped air sacs that help lungs exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules to and from the bloodstream, and scattered micro-clots were visualised in 21% samples. It was also revealed that 71% samples had increased activity of Kupfer cells, the first line of defence for the liver, 27.5% had evidence of liver cell death and 14% had features of acute chronic liver failure. The kidney samples showed nearly every second deceased patient had acute injury in the small tube-like structures of the organ that remove salt, excess fluid and waste products from blood. None of the patients showed microvascular thrombosis or clot formation in the kidneys. All heart biopsies showed non-specific features, such as hypertrophy with nucleomegaly with no evidence of myocardial necrosis (death of cells responsible for generating contractile force in the intact heart). A senior doctor at AIIMS said that biopsy of organs was an important step towards understanding the disease. “Many studies conducted abroad have shown clot formation in the organs as an important cause of death. However, in our study, clots weren’t seen in the tissue samples. This could also be because in our country anti-coagulants, a drug to prevent clot formation, are given to almost all patients with severe Covid-19 infection,” added the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lungs-liver-kidneys-covid-hurts-them-most/articleshow/84216280.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Delhi||Devise scientific formula for oxygen storage: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: There should be “no shortage or knee-jerk reaction” again on supply, storage and availability of liquid oxygen in the city, Delhi high court cautioned on Wednesday. With an eye on a possible third wave and taking stock of the Covid-19 management after over a month, the court asked the Centre to inform it of the steps taken in ensuring a buffer stock of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) for the capital, even as the Aam Aadmi Party government claimed it currently had 419 metric tonnes as the buffer. The court also directed the Centre to inform within a week the steps taken in terms of the Supreme Court’s April 30 order asking it to create a buffer stock of LMO, saying it has been pending for a long time and needs to be addressed. “Our anxiety is that there has to be a scientific formula on oxygen storage. The whole idea is that there is no shortage or knee-jerk reaction if the situation crops up again,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh pointed out after Delhi government said 171MT buffer stock had been installed and it was in the process of installing another 150MT. The government also submitted that storage facilities had been expanded but the stock was being stored with the oxygen suppliers, and it would soon be transported to the city. The bench highlighted that during the second wave, the “problem/bottleneck was LMO reaching Delhi”. It said once the government had created storage capacity in Delhi, “you should fill it, that’s when you will know what else it entails for filling it up. Don’t wait for a time when a crisis starts to develop, at that time you may not get it.” In case of a surge in Covid-19 cases, LMO should be readily available, the high court emphasised. “Tomorrow if you need it and what if supplies don’t come from outside. There might be a possibility that you have the capacity to store, but you would not get the oxygen quantity when you need it and your storage tanks will be empty,” it said. “At the time of crisis, every state will run for oxygen and then you will find it difficult to get.” The Aam Aadmi Party government has been asked to file a status report on the buffer stock and give details of the locations of storage tanks and how much quantity of LMO is being stored there. The court also asked the Centre to file a status report in response to recommendations made by IIT Delhi on oxygen storage in the national capital. IIT-D has proposed certain steps to be taken by the central government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/devise-scientific-formula-for-o2-storage-hc/articleshow/84216235.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Coimbatore||Three guest workers test positive for Covid in Tirupur||Health officials in Tirupur have scaled up monitoring and testing of guest workers after three of the workers, who had returned from northern states, tested positive for Covid-19 immediately after their arrival. The health officials are keeping a close watch on other guest workers, who had travelled with the trio, and asked other passengers of the train to isolate themselves. Guest workers from West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and other states had started returning in sizeable numbers to Tirupur after the lockdown was lifted and garment units resumed full-fledged operations. The detection of Covid-19 among the guest workers at a time when Tirupur has been reporting a steady fall in the daily caseload has posed a fresh challenge for the health officials. From reporting 1,000 new cases daily in June, the count had come down to 197 in Tirupur on Wednesday. The infection among the workers of garment units could pose trouble, because most of the smaller units have dozens of people working in close quarters. Though garment units have been instructed to ensure social distancing among the workers and get them wear masks, there could be deviations which would result in a faster spread. Besides, most of the guest workers stay in small congested rooms, where the possibility of transmission to the roommates is high. “It is also difficult for the guest workers to isolate themselves given the fact that they stay in bunches in small rooms. They cannot afford separate rooms for isolation,” said a health official. The officials, however, have ensured that all the guest workers landing in Tirupur railway station are tested. The team of health staff deployed at the railway station also collect the name, aadhar number and mobile phone number of the workers during the sample collection. “We try to get the result as early as possible. If someone tests positive, we plan to take the patient to hospital and send the roommates to isolation centres,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/three-guest-workers-test-ve-for-virus-in-tirupur/articleshow/84218534.cms||---
---||Delhi||File status report on black fungus drug availability: Delhi HC asks Centre||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Wednesday asked the Centre to file a status report on availability and domestic production of a key drug, which is used to treat patients of black fungus. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh further directed the central government to indicate the status of quantities of Liposomal Amphotericin B actually imported and the outstanding supplies, after it was informed by the Centre’s counsel that there are at present 17,000 active cases of the disease in the country. The high court also inquired if there is any shortage of the medicine currently, but was informed by the Centre that the number of patients has gone down. The bench, however, observed that enough stocks should be in place in preparation for a third wave of Covid and asked the government to deal with availability and supply with a sense of urgency. The court had in June expressed satisfaction over the guidelines issued by Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) on possible treatment options for black fungus for which Liposomal Amphotericin B was the drug of choice and asked the expert body to review it on a regular interval. During Wednesday’s hearing, the bench also wondered if ICMR and National Centre for Disease Control have carried out any study on efficiency of drugs used in Covid-19 treatment. It pointed out that while ICMR and even WHO had removed Ivermectin from the treatment protocol, doctors involved in Covid treatment vouched for its efficacy. “For example, Ivermectin is one of the medicines which several medical practitioners have claimed to be effective as a preventive drug. But ICMR and WHO have taken the stand that there is insufficient data available to positively state if this drug works as a prophylactic for treatment of Covid-19. It is essential that the concerned institutions undertake the exercise of compiling and analysing the data with regard to use of medication for preventing and treating Covid and on that basis to come out with their reports,” the high court noted. “There is a lot of talk about Ivermectin being effective, and the medical fraternity seems to have found it useful. ICMR should study what is coming from doctors on the ground and look at it. There are even talks that there are medical lobbies that don’t want to promote Ivermectin, it is no longer patent-protected. Anyone can manufacture and availability is there,” it pointed out, while asking NCDC and ICMR to file a report if any study has been conducted or steps taken on that front in two weeks’ time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/file-status-report-on-black-fungus-drug-availability/articleshow/84216256.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Narayan Rane’s return is move vs Sena & bid to win Maratha support||MUMBAI: Narayan Rane’s induction into the Union cabinet on Wednesday is being viewed as an unexpected rise for the veteran politician after his rise and fall in the state’s politics. It signals BJP’s intent to strengthen its base in the coastal Konkan region and its push for a neta who can directly take on Uddhav Thackeray. Importantly, in the recent past, former CM and Rajya Sabha MP Rane has emerged as an aggressive Maratha leader, and the BJP expects his elevation will help it to secure the support of Marathas whose stir for a quota has still not borne fruit. During Congress-NCP rule in the state, Rane was chairman of a committee set up to provide reservation to the Marathas. Rane began his political career as shakha pramukh or the local unit head of the Shiv Sena in the Chembur area. An aggressive municipal councillor, he was first elected to the legislative council in 1990 and was made cabinet member in 1995 in the Sena-BJP government led by Manohar Joshi. In 1999, Sena founder Bal Thackeray asked Joshi to step down and installed Rane as chief minister. When Rane later took on Uddhav Thackeray as a Sena leader, he was expelled from the party in July 2005 and subsequently joined the Congress on the assurance that he would soon be made the CM. Rane was inducted as cabinet minister and was given the industries portfolio. Rane later criticized the Congress high command when Ashok Chavan replaced Vilasrao Deshmukh as CM after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks before expressing regrets about his comments. After waiting for 12 years, Rane quit the Congress in 2017 and floated his own party, Maharashtra Swabhiman Paksha. Rane then had a series of meetings with then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and union home minister Amit Shah on his party’s merger with the BJP. With BJP’s support, Rane was elected to the Rajya Sabha. His contention was that since he was joining the BJP, he should get a better deal and should be considered for a post in the union cabinet whenever an expansion took place. Along with Fadnavis, Rane was in constant touch with NCP president Sharad Pawar but later preferred to join the BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ranes-return-is-move-vs-sena-bid-to-win-maratha-support/articleshow/84221497.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The accused were intercepted after their arrival from Johannesburg via Addis Ababa on June 27. “During X-ray of their abdomen, some capsule-like substance were detected. Subsequently, a total of 106 capsules containing 1.05 kg of light-yellowish colour powdery substance concealed inside their abdomen, suspected to be narcotics were recovered,” officials said. When this material was subjected to field drug test, it prima facie appeared to contain heroin.

---||Delhi||Third Covid wave: Panel suggests economic curbs in Delhi if positivity rate crosses 5%||NEW DELHI: An expert committee formed by Delhi government to devise measures to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus, in case a third Covid-19 wave hits the capital, has suggested strict steps, including curbs on economic activities if the positivity rate crosses 5%. A graded response action plan has been made by formulating it on four colours. Each colour indicates a different level of the situation with various measures of containment and mitigation. While the Yellow Alert (level 1) entails minimum economic restrictions, Red Alert (level 4) has the maximum curbs. In case the positivity rate touches 0.5% and remains at the same level or above it for two consecutive days, then Yellow Alert would be sounded. Yellow Alert can also be sounded if 1,500 cumulative new positive cases are reported within seven days or average occupancy of oxygenated beds hits 500 for the same duration. Under Yellow Alert, all economic activities, non-essential and essential factories and essential shops and establishments would be allowed to open, while non-essential shops would open on odd-even basis from 10am to 8pm. Malls would open on an odd-even basis from 10am to 8pm and one weekly market would be allowed each day in every zone. Greater economic restrictions would follow if the positivity rate touches 1% and remains at the same level or above it for two consecutive days. In such a situation, Amber Alert (level 2) would be sounded. It can also be sounded if 3,500 cumulative new positive cases are reported for seven days or average occupancy of oxygenated beds is 700 for the same duration. Under level 2, all construction activities, non-essential and essential factories and essential shops and establishments would be allowed to open, while non-essential shops and malls would open on an odd-even basis from 10am to 6pm, and one weekly market would be allowed each day in every zone. Orange Alert (level 3) would be sounded if positivity rate touches 2% and remains at the same level or above for two consecutive days. It would also be in force if 9,000 cumulative new positive cases are reported for seven days or average occupancy of oxygenated beds is 1,000 for the same duration. Under this, only those construction activities would be allowed where labourers stay on site, essential factories, establishments and shops would be allowed to open, while non-essential shops, malls and weekly markets would remain closed. Standalone shops would remain open from 10am to 6pm. Red Alert would be sounded if positivity rate touches 5% and remains above it for two consecutive days. It would also be sounded if 16,000 cumulative new positive cases are reported for seven days or average occupancy of oxygenated beds is 3,000 for the same duration. The committee has suggested economic curbs similar to Orange Alert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/panel-suggests-economic-curbs-if-positivity-rate-gt-5/articleshow/84216387.cms||AlokKNMishra

A report by the department of ports and transport has revealed that Ahmedabad city registered 1,185 accidents in 2020, of which 340 are fatal — the highest among all cities in the state. It also red-flagged 22 junctions and road stretches in the city as ‘accident black spots’ which need immediate engineering intervention by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, National Highway Authority of India as well as state roads and building department to make them safer for commuters. As per the report, almost half of the state’s road accidents and fatalities in 2020 were registered in the state’s four major cities — Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot. Of the four, Ahmedabad witnessed the most accidents. Among the most troublesome junctions in the city, Pakwan Crossroads, Narol Circle, SP Ring Road near Odhav, Nikol-Dastaan Crossroads, CTM Crossroads and Naroda Patia Crossroads have witnessed more than 10 fatalities in a year. The accident study commissioned by the state road transport department, traffic police and AMC had found that 44% of road accidents in the city had at least one minor injury, 31% accidents had serious injuries and 25% saw at least one occupant lose life. It was observed that the highest accidents during the year took place on Wednesdays which is 16% of the total. Also, close to 19% of the accidents took place during peak hours between 9am and noon and then again between 9pm and 11pm. The study also pointed out that crucial road infrastructure needed to be installed at accident-prone areas. “Traffic calming devices should be used to slow vehicles to desired speed. These can be installed just before the approach to an intersection. This will reduce reaction time while encountering critical situations as this feature grabs the attention of the road user,” claims a research paper by JP Research which was commisioned by the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-has-22-accident-black-spots/articleshow/84216333.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Delhi||Family robbed at gunpoint in west Delhi's Uttam Nagar||NEW DELHI: Armed men barged into the house of a realtor and looted cash and jewellery worth several lakhs after holding the family at gunpoint on Wednesday afternoon at Uttam Nagar in west Delhi. The incident, which took place around 2.15pm on Wednesday, was captured on CCTV cameras installed in the house. An FIR has been filed and multiple teams formed to catch the robbers. Crime Branch has also been roped in to investigate the case. The house owner, Vinod, was away at work and his wife, Seema, mother, brother-in-law Sachin, and two children aged four and three were at home. Police suspect that an insider may have tipped off the robbers as the target house was located on the fourth floor of the building. The robbers seemed to have a precise idea about the location and family members. CCTV footage showed the robbers, who were wearing masks and helmets, coming to the house on two scooters. One of them ran the doorbell and when the businessman’s wife opened the door, he claimed to be from the electricity department and said that he had come to fix a fault. He then entered the flat and flashed his gun at Seema asking her to move back. The footage showed a scared Seema going back even as her daughter started to cry. All the four robbers then barged into the house. While one of them was seen waving a pistol, the other, who was wearing a helmet, flashed a huge knife at a child and Sachin. He overpowered Sachin and tied his hands at the back using a tape. The robber asked him to lie on the floor with his head down and warned the others not to raise an alarm. The criminals then went to the other rooms of the flat and ransacked them over the next 30 minutes. They also made Seema open the electronic safe and took away the cash kept in it. The PCR got a call about the incident at 3.42pm and a team was immediately rushed to the spot. A forensics team analysed the place and CCTV footage was circulated among cops for identification of the robbers. The businessman is being asked about recent business deals and people who had visited his house. Domestic helpers, scrap dealers and vegetables vendors are also being quizzed. Footage from CCTV cameras from different localities is being obtained to ascertain where the criminals may have fled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/family-robbed-at-gunpoint-in-uttam-ngr/articleshow/84216360.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Delhi||Notice to Delhi corporations over pupil-teacher ratio||NEW DELHI: Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) has issued notices to the city’s three municipal corporations over inadequate pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) at their schools. Earlier last week, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had shared the data from UDISE and said the schools of the corporations had PTR less than 50%. Tweeting the letters written to the three corporations, DCPCR chairperson Anurag Kundu said, “DCPCR has issued notices to all three MCDs on the media reports, which suggest nearly half of their schools don’t meet the criteria of sufficient teachers, which is a violation of the Right to Education Act.” DCPCR has asked the municipal corporations to provide information on the number of teaching positions lying vacant in the schools run by them. It has also sought school-wise data classifying regular, contractual and guest teachers. The corporations have been asked to file reply to these queries by July 12. Sisodia earlier said that almost 98% of the Delhi government schools had PTR as mandated by the RTE Act. “In east corporation, 57.7% of schools, north 45.86% and in south, 38.9% of schools are not complying with the PTR requirement.” The corporations, however, stated that their PTR was in tandem with the Right to Education Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/notice-to-corpns-over-pupil-teacher-ratio/articleshow/84216385.cms||---

The accused posed as employees of social security administration and duping foreign nationals. Shibesh Singh, joint CP (Crime), said 82 desktop PCs, a server, five laptops, 84 mobile phones and 48 ID cards were seized. Police received information about an illegal call centre running in the garb of a travel agency in Kirti Nagar. A team raided the premises and found 20-25 men and women engaged in communicating with prospective victims. “They were impersonating the social security administration department of US, and used VOIP calling, bypassing the legal gateways and cheating innocent people based abroad on the pretext of saving them from suspension of their social security number,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-call-centres-busted-94-held/articleshow/84216389.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Govt directs 4 cities to rectify faulty roads||Gandhinagar: Almost half of the deaths in road accidents in Gujarat occur in the limits of four municipal corporations: Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot. On the basis of an input from the state road safety council, the road and transport department has directed these four corporations to rectify faulty roads, especially accident-causing black spots, to minimize road accidents. Manoj Das, in-charge ACS, ports and transport department, wrote a departmental order to municipal commissioners of the four cities, directing them to address accident-causing road engineering issues. He said the Supreme Court-appointed committee on road safety, the ministry of road transport and highways and the state government are concerned and want to minimize accidents in the state. “It has been observed that half of the fatalities in the state have been reported in four municipal corporation areas. So the government has directed the four authorities to take the necessary action. The road safety council has prepared a detailed list of black spots in these four cities where the maximum fatalities have been reported,” Das said. “Officials of the road safety council will visit all four cities and have meetings with their road engineering teams to discuss a detailed action plan to correct all faulty roads and black spots. All four municipal authorities will have to carry out scientific road safety audits, implement work zone management, traffic management plans and traffic calming measures. All four corporations have to submit regular action-taken reports,” Das added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-directs-4-cities-to-rectify-faulty-roads/articleshow/84216396.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Kolkata||Keshav Dutt: A legend, a crowd-puller and a winner||KOLKATA: He used to boss the grassy field with a hockey stick with so much class that his place in any team — be it the national or the club one — was always a certainty. Such was his charisma — he used to come to play for Mohun Bagan in the Calcutta Hockey League riding a Harley-Davidson bike — that supporters from even rival teams came to the field to watch him play. Old-timers on the Maidan still recall how the domination of Pancha Pandava’s East Bengal in football had its match in Keshav Chandra Dutt of Bagan on a hockey field. Dutt, the final link to post-independent India’s first Olympic hockey gold, passed away in the city in the wee hours of Wednesday. The two-time Olympic champion was 95 and had been suffering with age-related ailments for long. “He loved Kolkata so much that he refused to go with his wife and children when they decided to settle abroad,” recalled Gurbux Singh, another hockey legend, while speaking to TOI. “He was one of the greats who I always looked up to as an inspiration,” the 1964 Olympic hockey gold-winner Gurbux added. Like many of his generation, Dutt was a man who wore many hats. Apart from playing hockey at the highest level, he was a former state badminton champion as well as quite a decent hand with a tennis racquet. But it was his performance in the 1948 London Olympics and the next Games in Helsinki in 1952, which helped him find his place under the sun in Indian hockey, regarded as the golden era of the game. Mohun Bagan honoured their crowd-pulling star of the 1950s with the club’s highest award — Mohun Bagan Ratna — in 2019. The state government felicitated him with the ‘Banglar Gourav’ award in 2013 and Hockey Bengal gave him the Dhyan Chand Lifetime Achievement award in 2020. Born in Lahore on December 29 in 1925, Dutt was playing in the national championship in Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1948, when his hometown in Pakistan underwent a massive post-independent riot. He came to Kolkata two years later and made the city his home. Gurbux, however, rued that like Balbir Singh Sr, Dutt also deserved to end his career with a hat-trick of Olympic gold. “He was picked up for the 1956 Olympic Games camp. But the company he used to work at that time refused to grant him leave. However, his legacy will always be remembered as someone who played the game with a big heart and was a true patriot in every sense of the term,” Gurbux said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/keshav-dutt-a-legend-a-crowd-puller-and-a-winner/articleshow/84216383.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BMC razed flower pots for hawkers’ sake: Colaba locals||MUMBAI: Colaba residents and shopkeepers crossed swords with the BMC after flower beds at Colaba causeway were “surreptitiously” demolished on Monday night. Residents alleged that hawkers were trying to encroach onto the space. On Tuesday, shopkeepers tried to rebuild the flower beds, but, on Wednesday morning, BMC demolished them. When residents went to the local ward office, they said they told that there is no permission to build flower beds on the footpath. Haresh Hathiramani of Colaba Residents and Shopkeepers Association said that if the space is left vacant, hawkers take it over. “By demolishing flower beds, BMC is showing whom it supports... On Wednesday, we were taken to the police station too,” said Hathiramani. Corporator Makrand Narwekar called it a “Black Day” and said that the flower beds have been there for two decades and now BMC says that it is unauthorised. “We have video footage of how the flower beds were razed surreptitiously... Colaba causeway has only been left to tolerate these hawkers, with no public space left. We conveyed this to the ward officer,” said Narwekar. Assistant municipal commissioner of the ward, Chanda Jadhav, said that civic staff surveyed the area. “We did not find any illegal hawkers. We do not want flower beds and will not tolerate any unauthorized hawkers either. The footpath space, especially near zebra crossings, needs to be kept open for public to move,” said Jadhav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-razed-flower-pots-for-hawkers-sake-colaba-locals/articleshow/84218799.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Goa||Goa: Fishermen urge NGT to delay CZMP hearing||PANAJI: After dismissing Goa Foundation’s review application praying for time limit of six months, instead of the August 31 deadline, to finalise the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) for Goa, the NGT is set to hear another petition filed by Goenchea Raponkarancho Ekvott (GRE) and Goencho Ekvott for postponement of Thursday’s CZMP hearings in North and South Goa. They are seeking postponement on grounds that the fisheries planning committee, constituted by the department of environment and climate change in March, has not completed the process of identification of fishermen’s houses to be included in the draft comprehensive plan for the fishing community living in CRZ areas. This was scheduled to be completed within 60 days. GRE and Goencho Ekvott have raised apprehension that the committee’s report will not have legal sanctity if it is completed after the public hearing is over. The committee’s tenure was extended to September 30, 2021 since, due to the election code of conduct, the department couldn’t tender documents to appoint the agency to assist the committee and therefore, it hasn’t completed the process of identifying fishermen’s houses as per the gazetted order. The associations have also stated that they were not able to meet people due to lockdown restrictions and are also seeking postponement on grounds that a large section of the fishing community has been affected by Covid and that some are not physically fit to attend the meetings on Thursday. GRE general secretary Olencio Simoes said 95% of houses of the fishing community in CRZ areas have not yet been regularised since 1991.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fishermen-urge-ngt-to-delay-czmp-hearing/articleshow/84218615.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Farmer grows apples in hot Osmanabad of Marathwada||AURANGABAD: While apple growing is traditionally considered synonymous with Kashmir, an innovative farmer from Osmanabad district of Marathwada has succeeded in changing the notion. In an agricultural revolution of its sort, Nitin Sawant, a farmer from Jagaji village of Osmanabad, has successfully cultivated apples in the area that is known for dry and hot weather. Sawant, who has arranged the low-chilling apple variety from Vietnam, has cultivated 210 apple trees which have started bearing fruit.  “The apple variety requires only around 50 chilling hours. The fruits have the same characteristics as that of apples cultivated in Kashmir or other parts of north India,” said Sawant. This sweet success has come to Sawant after a lot of patience and hard work of around three years. “I started experimenting with apple-growing around 2018. To begin with, I carried out plantation on one-acre agricultural land. The saplings, during their growth, required certain care, including timely spraying of pesticides and insecticides. The planted trees gradually grew up to a height of eight feet and are bearing fruits of proper size,” said Sawant who holds a degree in teachers’ education. With the first lot of his apples being out, Sawant is sending the harvested fruits to local markets fetching a price in the range of Rs 150 to Rs 200 per kilogram. Osmanabad district, which receives average annual rainfall of only 603 mm, is known for relatively hot weather and drought-prone conditions. District superintending agricultural officer for Osmanabad Umesh Ghatge on Sunday said that the apple cultivation at Jagaji village was a novel experiment in Marathwada. “All details of the agricultural experiment would be submitted to the Zonal Research Extension and Advisory of Committee of Parbhani-based Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University,”he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/farmer-grows-apples-in-hot-osmanabad-of-marathwada/articleshow/84206179.cms||Prasad Joshi

Sources said that Shafi sought a postponement through his lawyer citing health-related inconvenience. Customs is learnt to have issued him a fresh summons asking him to appear on July 12 for questioning. Customs sources said that a letter was given to them in which it was stated that Shafi had diarrhoea and hence he cannot appear on Tuesday. The sleuths would decide on the next course of action based on Shafi’s compliance to their fresh summons. The case pertains to the seizure of 2.3kg of gold from a person named Mohammed Shafeeque on June 21 at Karipur airport. Shafeeque had given a statement to customs that gangs operated by another accused Arjun Ayanki had informed him that Shafi and NK Sunil Kumar (alias Kodi Suni), who were convicted in TP Chandrasekharan murder case, were there to back Arjun and that he will be extended protection if Koduvally gang threatens him. On July 3, customs sleuths collected evidence with Ayanki at Shafi’s home in Chockli and subsequently at Suni’s house. A laptop, pen drive, digital camera and memory cards were seized from Shafi’s home. A metallic star symbol, usually seen on uniforms, was found at the residence. However, Suni’s house was locked. Both convicts are serving a life sentence for murdering RMP leader TP Chandrasekharan. Suni is presently in prison while Shafi was out on parole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kk-shafi-skips-customs-summons/articleshow/84216473.cms||---

---||Delhi||Citing calls between rape accused and woman, Delhi court grants bail||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Wednesday granted bail to a man accused of raping a 39-year-old woman saying 1,300 calls were exchanged between them, which allegedly proved that the relation between them was not against her wishes. While granting bail to Titu Bhati, the court pointed out that the woman had refused to undergo internal medical examination, therefore, there was no specific medical evidence regarding the alleged forced relationship. “The call duration has been running sometimes up to 2,232 seconds. In fact, over 1,300 calls have been exchanged between them, which proves that the relation was not against her wishes. Moreover, she is 39-year-old and married with three children, while the accused is married too. Both were aware about the consequences of such relationship,” said additional sessions judge Devender Kumar in his order. The court, however, said, though physical assault on the family members of the complainant was not supported by any medico legal report, it was a serious concern and had to be taken care of by putting strict bail conditions. It granted Bhati bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 50,000 with one surety of like amount and directed him not to have any contact with the complainant and her family. The woman in the FIR had claimed that the accused procured her mobile number and pressured her to form a physical relationship. She added that Bhati even manhandled her and her family members several times. The court noted that the woman in her statement, recorded before a magistrate, had admitted that she was in a consensual relationship with the accused. It added that the investigating officer had denied any incident of assault on her family. Advocate Pradeep Teotia, appearing for Bhati, claimed that the accused was falsely implicated and in judicial custody since June 29.Additional public prosecutor R K Satyarthi, appearing for police, opposed the bail plea and said Bhati had allegedly formed a physical relationship with the woman and started putting pressure and even beating her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/citing-calls-between-rape-accused-and-woman-delhi-court-grants-bail/articleshow/84216417.cms||---

The road transport department on Wednesday issued a circular stating that appointments for the automated driving test tracks will be over two shifts. The circular stated that the first shift will be from 6am to 2.15pm and the second from 2.15pm to 10.30pm. The circular stated that verification of documents will begin at 6am and the first test on the driving track will start at 6.30am. The circular states that since the curfew due t Covid-19 is from 10pm, the last test will have to be completed by 9.20pm. Officials in the RTO said the government has asked local authorities to make arrangement for lighting in the area. Also, waiting area will have to be properly lit to prevent any untoward incidents. Officials said the circular also states that Gujarat Industrial Security Force will have to be deployed. The night shifts will be only for Ahmedabad (Subhash Bridge and Vastral), Rajkot, Vadodara and Surat. For the other RTOs, there will be no change in the schedule. RTO officials said at present the wait period was longer than 45 days and appointments were taken within half an hour of slots opening. Officials said without appointments, people were forced to get learner’s licences renewed. Officials said the success ratio for the driving test for cars is 30% to 35% while for two-wheelers it is 70%. Officials said it remains to be seen how effective the new system is as inspectors and staff will have to arrive before 6am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/driving-tests-to-be-taken-in-two-shifts-from-now/articleshow/84216472.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: SP chief Akhilesh Yadav fears misuse of police machinery in polls||LUCKNOW: Accusing the ruling BJP of misusing the administrative machinery to win the recently concluded zila panchayat adhyaksh polls, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday said the state government was now relying on incharges of police stations to ensure similar results in the block pramukh elections slated to be held on July 10. In an apparent reference to a letter purportedly issued by incharge of Urai Kotwali police station in Jalaun in which the officer has asked all beat incharges to provide names, addresses, details of supporters, family members and crime history of all recently elected block development council (BDC) members, Akhilesh said this proves that the government has directed the police to target the BDC members who will vote to elect the block pramukh. The letter is doing the rounds on social media. “It is ironic that police station heads are collecting details of members for another round of polls where again democracy will be pushed to take a backseat and muscle power and authority of the police will be used to win elections. This is because the BJP knows that the party cannot win elections on the basis of votes,” Akhilesh said. The former UP CM said to begin with authorities are trying every trick in the hat to ensure that SP backed candidates do not get the nomination papers in the first place, leave alone filing them and then contesting elections. “In Deoria, the administration was unwilling to give certificates to members required to procure nomination papers. When former MLA Anugreh Nayaran staged a sit-in, he was forcibly removed. In Chibramau (Kannauj) nomination papers of the SP backed candidate were snatched. In Balrampur district candidates other than that of the BJP are not being allowed to procure the nomination papers,” he said. Taking on the state election commission, the SP national president said SEC’s duty and responsibility does not end with issuing a circular saying that free and fair elections should be held. The SEC must also ensure that directions are being adhered to in letter and spirit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-fears-misuse-of-police-machinery-in-polls/articleshow/84220774.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Justice Verma had on Sunday suspended vice-president K John Manoj, secretary R Vijayanand, joint secretary Naresh Sharma, treasurer Surender Agarwal and councilor P Anuradha. “The HC has put aside the suspension order served on us by Justice Verma. It is a victory for the game and the institution. Nobody is above the game,” Manoj said on Wednesday evening. Will the stalemate end and reconciliation be made? “We have tried everything but he has ignored all calls for peace. Now the HC has given an order and, hence, he (Azhar) remains suspended,” Manoj said. Lashing out at president Mohd Azharuddin, Manoj said: “He has no business to interrupt the game and behave in such a high-handed manner. He unilaterally had announced a T20 tournament and even tried to arm twist the constitution by delegating powers to the nominated members of the Apex Council. How can a government nominee from CAG become a treasurer or how can the players’ representatives hold elected posts? What is even more astonishing is that Azhar kept the secretary’s post to himself. That shows his intentions and he clearly went against established norms,” Manoj said. “This is not the way a president should behave. Azhar hardly attends the Apex Council meetings which are called by the secretary. Instead he says all such meetings are illegal. He doesn’t have any administrative skills and neither is he willing to learn,” Manoj said and added that their office rooms at the RGIC stadium in Uppal were locked.  “There is no need to stoop to such cheap tactics,” Manoj, who was also a former HCA secretary, said. Manoj added that the league matches will commence from Thursday (July 8) with the A Division three-day matches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-stays-hca-apex-council-members-suspension/articleshow/84218673.cms||Solomon S Kumar
---||Mumbai||Funds to buy property routed through shell companies: ED||MUMBAI: The ED on Wednesday arrested Eknath Khadse’s son-in-law Girish Chaudhari in a money laundering case related to the MIDC land deal. During investigation, it was found that Chaudhari claimed the source of funds to purchase the property as loan from some companies. But these funds were layered and routed through shell companies, which are either dysfunctional or ceased to exist later on, the ED said. In Chaudhari’s remand application, ED stated the land was acquired by MIDC and there were various industries on the plot, so it was not possible to execute the sale deed with its original owner Ukani in April 2016 for Rs 3.75 crore. The ED alleged Khadse and others made illegal changes and alteration in government record to execute the deal. It was alleged Khadse had misused his minister’s post in 2016. Subsequently Khadse as revenue minister in the BJP-Sena government, pressurised his ministry’s officials to acquire the land from his kin after paying them Rs 61 crore compensation. The sub-registrar had earlier provided the value of the plot as Rs 31 crore, but Khadse coerced government officials to reduce market value of the plot to Rs 3.75 crore on government record, the ED said. It created a controversy before the payment of compensation, and subsequently Khadse was forced to resign from the post. Khadse is now with NCP. Chaudhari’s advocate Mohan Tekavde opposed the remand plea and said he had cooperated with the investigations. “Chaudhari is being targeted only because he is the son-in-law of Eknath Khadse. He has been falsely implicated. There is no evidence to show any loss of Rs 61 crore was caused to the exchequer as the ED has claimed. Further, it has not been proved that the disputed land belongs to MIDC,” Tekavde said. In his earlier statement to the ED, Khadse had denied any knowledge about the land deal after stating that it was executed by his wife and the son-in-law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ed-funds-to-buy-property-routed-through-shell-cos-in-mumbai/articleshow/84221530.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Chandigarh||Punjab’s fortnightly positivity lowest since Jan at 0.56%||CHANDIGARH: After a long haul, the fortnightly Covid-19 positivity rate in Punjab has come down to 0.56%, the lowest since January, after shooting up to high of 20% during the peak of the second wave. The weekly positivity rate till last week of January was recorded at 0.90% and it started to rise from the mid-February and remained much above the 5% limit fixed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) till May-end. After the second wave subsided, the positivity rate fell below the 5% mark for the first time in the first week of June and dropped below 1% on July 6. As per the data of the state health department, there are only six districts -- Ferozepur (1.4%), Mohali (1.3%), Mansa (1.2%), Bathinda (1.1%), Moga (1%) and Faridkot (1%) -- having a positivity rate of 1% or a little over 1% while seven districts have positivity rate below the state’s average. During the peak of the massive second wave that had rattled the state, the positivity rate of all the districts had crossed the double-figure mark. The percentage of people testing positive for the virus remains higher in the urban areas. Against the rural positivity rate of 0.31%, 0.48% of the people tested were found infected in urban areas. As of July 6, Barnala had the highest urban positivity rate of 5.26% while in Mohali 2.44% of people tested were found Covid-positive. After maintaining a high testing rate through the peak of the second wave, there has been a notable drop in the number of tests being conducted in the state. The seven-day average of tests per million population was 1,751 on June 24, the fifth highest in the country, which has come down to 1,453 as on July 6. The state’s testing figures, though, continue to remain above the national average of 1,422 tests per million. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar attributed the drop in number of cases and positivity rate to the containment and management efforts put in by the government. "Since the beginning of the second wave special focus was given on testing, extensive level IV contact tracing and timely isolation and treatment of infected patients," he added. NO LARGE CONTAINMENT ZONE As there has been a substantial drop in the number of fresh cases, the count of containment zones has also come down, indicating that the spread of Covid-19 has slowed down in the state. At present, there are no large containment zones in the state while the number of micro containment zones -- areas having 5 to 14 cases -- has come down to two, which during the peak had crossed 200.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjabs-fortnightly-positivity-lowest-since-jan-at-0-56/articleshow/84220787.cms||Vinod Kumar
---||Lucknow||Chitralekha’s creator Bhagwati Charan Varma coined ‘Dilip Kumar’||LUCKNOW: The tragedy king's journey from Yusuf Khan to Dilip Kumar passes through Lucknow. The actor’s screen name was given by the celebrated writer of 'Chitralekha' Bhagwati Charan Varma who hailed from the city. Varma's family in Lucknow recalls that when Yusuf Khan was taken in his debut film 'Jwar Bhata' (1944), a screen name for him was to be chosen. “My father was the script writer of the film being produced by the Bombay Talkies. The owner Devika Rani asked for a few suggestions,” said Dhirendra Varma’s, his son who is also an author. Recalling the stories narrated by his father, Dhirendra added: “While my father suggested Dilip Kumar, Devika Rani proposed Vasudev. Another suggestion was Jehangir. Yusuf Khan was given the choice to finalise and he chose Dilip Kumar. The actor in his autobiography – Dilip Kumar: The Substance and The Shadow -- has narrated how Devika Rani proposed the new name and he took some time to accept it. The proposition left him speechless for a moment, Dilip Kumar has written, and he asked if it was really necessary. “She (Devika Rai) gave her a sweet smile and told me that it would be prudent to do so... I was quick to appreciate her concern but I told her I needed to think about it a bit. She responded: ‘Fine … come back to me with your thoughts. Finally, the choice was given to Yusuf Khan who picked Dilip Kumar for himself,” reads the chapter 'Lights Camera Action' in the autobiography. He further said: “I must confess that the new identity as Dilip Kumar had a liberating impact on me.” He has further said that he consulted director S Mukherjee about the name change who told him that people close to him would always know him as Yusuf, he said that the turmoil died when he got to know that actor Ashok Kumar’s real name was Kumudlal Kunjilal Ganguly. Bhagwati Charan Verma’s grand son Chandra Shekar said that in the 1970s, BR Chopra made an effort to bring his grandfather and Dilip Kumar together again for a project on Chanakya and Chandragupta. “The script was written but somehow the project could not take off. So he converted the script into a novel titled Chanakya,” he said. Sahitya Akademi award winner and Padma Bhusan Varma is a legendary name in Hindi literature who had 17 novels to his credit. His 'Chitralekha' has been turned into a movie twice. The second adaptation of the novel, made by Kidar Sharma, had Meena Kumari, Pradeep Kumar and Ashok Kumar in the leading roles, and immortal songs written by Sahir. Varma had a brief stint in the Mumbai film industry before he turned full-time independent writer in 1957 and shifted base to his native city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/chitralekhas-creator-coined-dilip-kumar/articleshow/84220807.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Goa||Michael Lobo’s wife keen on contesting 2022 polls on BJP ticket||PANAJI: Science and technology minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo has said that his wife, Delilah, has expressed willingness to contest the upcoming 2022 state assembly election on a BJP ticket. Lobo said that she will put her case in writing before the party to contest either from Siolim or Saligao. Delilah is currently sarpanch of Parra and the vice-president of BJP’s Mahila Morcha. Stating that she has been active in politics for the past 15 years, including five years as pancha and 10 years as sarpanch, Lobo said Delilah understands grassroots politics. He said that back in 2017, too, Delilah wanted to contest from Saligao as former tourism minister Dilip Parulekar was a weak candidate. “But, former chief minister Manohar Parrikar came to our house and requested her not to contest,” he said. Refuting claims of ‘family politics’, Lobo said he and Delilah are working day and night for the people. However, he refused to comment on whether his wife would contest as an independent if denied a ticket by BJP. Meanwhile, responding to former Calangute sarpanch Joseph Sequeira’s statement, that people would send Lobo home in the 2022 election, the MLA said, “It’s the people who will decide.” “The assembly election is seven months away and the panchayat elections are soon after that, so Sequeira has started making statements and others at the panchayat-level have also started getting into verbal duels. This is nothing but petty politics,” Lobo said. Responding to Sequeira’s claims of lack of development in Calangute since Lobo became MLA, he said, “If you compare the roads now to what they were earlier, there’s marked improvement. Also, you will no longer find garbage littered everywhere as we’ve taken care of the issue.” He also urged activists not to keep filing police complaints against their rivals. “I appeal to them to work for the people instead,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobos-wife-keen-on-contesting-2022-polls-on-bjp-ticket/articleshow/84218700.cms||---

Police said they have also recovered the murder weapon. They also revealed that the woman was probably not raped. Investigators said she may have had sex before her murder but it was not forced. Officials said the family was not in a state to speak the cops, but they would take the statement of her husband. Police said the victim was identified as Rekha Jayesh, a resident of Amraiwadi, who was married and had children. On Tuesday, Khokhra police had found her body hidden in a water tank. The body was taken out with the help of fire brigade personnel, who cut open the tank. Khokhra police is waiting for the final report of the postmortem to know the exact cause of death. However, it appears she had been murdered 48 hours before the body was found. Officials said police found that she did not work at the factory and how she was brought to the terrace remains a mystery. Officials said they are looking at the possibility that she was murdered and then brought to the terrace. Investigators said they cannot rule out the possibility that she had gone to the spot of her own volition and may have been murdered after a dispute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/body-in-water-tank-weapon-found/articleshow/84216514.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra warns districts against high vax wastage, Covaxin leads chart||Alarmed by high rates of vaccine wastage in several districts, the administration has written to collectors, divisional and municipal commissioners, urging them to control the losses. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary of the public health department, has pointed out in his letter that some districts have reported negative vaccine wastage, which means they have drawn more doses from vials. But there are districts “that have reported very high levels of vaccine wastage, which needs to be minimised”. A higher number of districts have shown relatively high levels of wastage of Covaxin (see box). In some cases, wastage is more than 10%, data from the health department shows. As for Covishield, fewer districts, including Mumbai, are reporting wastage of around 5%. Experts have said levels below 10% are permissible. Even the Centre’s guidelines have also factored in an allowable wastage of 10%. At least 20 districts --- including Pune, Ahmednagar, Nagpur, Amravati and Jalgaon -- have reported 0% Covishield wastage. About eight districts have so far reported 0% or lower wastage of Covaxin. Data has shown that some districts are vaccinating less than 100 beneficiaries on average per session, which could be causing wastage or sub-optimal use of resources. The state average is 104 beneficiaries per session. Since vaccines being used at the moment are not under the ‘open-vial policy’ and must be used up within a stipulated period, low turnouts at vaccination centres can cause wastage. D N Patil, the state immunisation officer, said: “Vaccine wastage data is uploaded by the districts on CoWin (which has the inbuilt eVIN or Electronic Vaccine intelligence network system). Sometimes, when there are delays in uploading latest stock data, it may seem like wastage. But that isn’t the case. Only minimal districts are reporting higher vaccine wastage. We have been taking regular follow-ups with them, asking them to mobilise more beneficiaries for the sessions. We have also asked such districts to open vaccine vials only after the maximum number of beneficiaries they wish to inoculate are present at the site.” Another state official said: “A 10% wastage is allowed programmatically. One also has to take into account the human factor in drawing out more doses from a vial. It is not a robotic process. Therefore, 5% wastage for a district is not high.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-warns-districts-against-high-vax-wastage-covaxin-leads-chart/articleshow/84216567.cms||Neha Madaan

Justice Ashok Menon issued the order after considering a petition filed by Fasal’s brother Abdul Sathar. He sought a probe on the basis of RSS worker Subeesh’s revelation that a gang, including him, carried out the killing. The court said it is not proper to dismiss the allegation altogether without conducting a probe. The HC had ordered a CBI probe on a petition filed by Fasal’s wife. CBI completed the investigation and filed a final report naming eight persons, including CPM leaders Karayi Rajan and Karayi Chandrasekharan. Subeesh had allegedly told a police team that Fasal was killed by a gang that included him. Though Subeesh later withdrew his statement, the petitioner had sought a probe on it. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/high-court-directs-cbi-to-probe-rss-angle-in-fasal-murder-case/articleshow/84216619.cms||---

A Rapid Action Force team on a march“We also decided to deploy police from Thursday onwards on the route of the Rath Yatra and have also started chalking up the plan for additional deployment,” said a city police officer. A meeting of city police officers and the temple trustees also took place on Tuesday, where various plans for the Rath Yatra were discussed. “There was also a proposal from the cops that the raths be pulled by tractors, but there was a technical issue, that the Raths do not have brakes and are pulled by trained khalasis. Pulling the raths by tractors may end up damaging them,” said Mahendra Jha, one of the trustees of the Jagannath temple. Jha added, “Union home minister Amit Shah will attend the mangla aarti at the Jagannath temple on the Rath Yatra day, July 12.” He said other rituals like Pahind Vidhi will be held for which chief minister Vijay Rupani has been invited. On Tuesday night, city police commissioner Sanjay Srivastava went to Saraspur which is considered the “mosal” (maternal uncle’s home) of Lord Jagannath and worshipped at a temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rath-yatra-likely-to-be-held-conditions-apply/articleshow/84216630.cms||---

Hearing a PIL and referring to the aftermath of cyclone Tauktae, a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni had on June 30 sought responses of the state, Centre and BMC on how they will deal with the problem. The judges had prepared a list of all news reports, including TOI’s May 20 report, on the sea piling 87% more trash on seven city beaches on the day of cyclone. Advocate-general (AG) Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said he has been through the news reports and sought a short time to place on record the state’s stand. The judges reiterated they want the coastline and beaches clean. Justice Kulkarni said, “We want the coastline cleared and marine life to be protected.” The AG agreed, “It is said the sea vomits back what you have put in it.’’ The judges observed that during a cyclone whatever is on the bed of the sea is thrown back. While the AG said most of it is plastic, the judges said it includes plastic bags and cans. “The percentage of material coming to the shore is minuscule,” said the Chief Justice. The judges will hear the matter on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/clear-mumbai-city-beaches-state-coast-of-junk-hc-to-govt/articleshow/84221551.cms||Rosy Sequeira

A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a batch of PILs some of which were seeking preservation of OGH building because it is a heritage structure and some seeking its demolition to raise a new complex.

BSP chief Mayawati, though appearing soft towards the saffron party, is looking to consolidate her dalit vote bank, especially the Jatavs. Besides, Chandrashekhar Azad is emerging as the new dalit force in the western UP. In such a scenario, with elections just nine months away, the best foot forward for BJP would have been OBC and dalit outreach.

Abhishek Verma (33), who runs a cosmetic shop in Burari, said Babita had lent him Rs 50,000 last December for his sister’s wedding and used to constantly taunt them about their poor financial condition as he couldn’t return it. The accused had visited the victims’ house in southwest Delhi two days before the crime, when they had an argument over the same issue. He had then decided to eliminate them, police said. Abhishek was arrested from outside a mortuary when he was waiting there along with family members for the bodies. Police said an e-rickshaw driver who had dropped the accused to the Metro station after the crime and a CCTV grab of the accused carrying a CPU and a DVR helped them crack the case. The CCTV footage showed an e-rickshaw with Sarthi written on it, which helped police trace the driver. He told the cops that the man had bloodstains on him and had used an e-wallet to pay him as he had a torn note. On checking the details, police got to know about Abhishek. Ingit Pratap Singh, DCP (South West) said, “A team led by Palam SHO Paras Nath Verma traced the accused and arrested him. He had parked his scooter at Dashrathpuri Metro station and went to his aunt’s house. To mislead police, he had left the almirah open.” Abhishek had returned to the crime spot and even helped the cops pull out the bodies. Police have found the scooter, the cover of the CPU and the bloodstained clothes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nephew-killed-woman-cousin-over-taunts/articleshow/84218810.cms||---

The move came at an appropriate time, according to AMRI Hospitals CEO Rupak Barua, since the state and the country are bracing for the third wave of the pandemic. “Strengthening Swasthya Sathi is a step in the right direction for it has already benefitted a large number of people in Covid times. It will allow access to treatment to a larger section of the population,” said Barua. He added that there have been so far no payment issues with Swasthya Sathi scheme. “Despite apprehensions from some quarters, we have received all payments on time. But some medical management expenses and packages need to be priced rationally. This will make the scheme acceptable to a lot more hospitals. The allocation aimed at fighting Covid should help to bolster infrastructure before the third wave strikes. We need to spend on both physical infrastructure as well as medical to counter the next wave,” said Barua. Terming the budgetary allocation as ‘excellent’, Medica Superspecialty Hospital chairperson Alok Roy said it will help those who can’t spend from their pockets on health or bear Covid treatment expenses at private hospitals. “Already, the scheme has helped to save lives and more allocation should bring more people under the fold. It will help save families which have been left bankrupt due to Covid treatment expenses,” said Roy. The budget mentioned that the government now has 235 Covid-dedicated hospitals, including 41 requisitioned private facilities. While welcoming the allocation, cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar felt the amount seemed inadequate for both Covid and Swasthya Sathi. “With the kind of reach that Swasthya Sathi already has, a major portion of the amount will go towards funding the scheme. While this helps to reach treatment to a lot more people, we also need enough funds for Covid. We are still in the midst of the pandemic and a third wave seems imminent,” said Sarkar. This is indeed a great initiative when the country and the state is struggling during this pandemic, said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) zonal head R Venkatesh. “This comes as a blessing for all needy patients who otherwise would have found it difficult to access healthcare for Covid treatment. Swasthya Saathi has made good treatment accessible and affordable for all those who otherwise would struggle to fund any treatment, Covid or non-Covid,” said Venkatesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-budget-allots-fund-for-covid-and-swasthya-saathi/articleshow/84216651.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Sources aware of developments confirmed the latest turn of events. The new policy was announced in October 2019 by the Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB). It allowed captive jetties to handle third-party cargo after signing a one-time supplementary agreement. As on June 30, 2020, the last date for deciding to opt in or out of the proposal, of the total 38 captive licensees, 10 chose to opt in. Two captive jetty licensees opted out of the new policy and the remaining 26 did not make any submissions and are, therefore, deemed to have opted out, according to government sources. The decision was likely taken in view of the ongoing tussle between Essar Group’s promoters and ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel (AM/NS) India to wrest control of the captive port at the steel facility in Hazira. On December 13, 2019, the state maritime regulator signed a supplementary agreement with Essar Group that owns 74% equity stake in Essar Bulk Terminal Ltd (EBTL), the captive port at the Hazira steel facility. That allowed the group to handle third-party cargo without any quantitative restriction. AM/NS India, which acquired the debt-laden steel facility at Hazira in November 2019, holds the remaining 26% equity in EBTL. AM/NS India opposed the move. Through a ports & transport department letter dated December 17, 2019, the Government of Gujarat directed the GMB to hold the supplementary agreement in abeyance with immediate effect. The model supplementary agreement was to be approved by the government before further movement on the matter. In July 2020, AM/NS India filed a writ petition in the Gujarat high court against the Gujarat government, the GMB, and EBTL challenging the supplementary agreement. “The government and the GMB took the stand that the New Captive Jetty Policy, 2019, had not been operationalized,” said a government official. “The government and the GMB contended that the policy was currently under examination by the state government from legal and economic perspectives.” Many proposals for the development of new captive jetties remain undecided as the 2019 policy was not operationalized. Hence it was recently decided to hold the policy in abeyance and permit the GMB to process the development of captive jetty projects under the regime predating the 2019 policy, the official added. This was done after the state maritime regulator requested the Government of Gujarat to review and revise the New Captive Jetty Policy, 2019, he further said. Apart from signing supplementary agreements, the policy was never really implemented, said another senior government official. The 2019 policy aimed to unlock 55MTPA of cargo that is unutilized, said an industry expert. He said that it aimed to draw investments to the tune of Rs 4,000 crore after the expansion of the jetties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/2019-captive-jetty-policy-on-hold/articleshow/84216623.cms||Maulik Pathak

According to the data released by the Airports Authority of India (AAI), the number of passengers transiting through SVPI airport plunged from 3.5 lakh in April to merely 1.39 lakh in May, down 60%. International passenger footfalls registered a steep fall from 34,037 in April to 7,442 in May. Flights to several international destinations were suspended by the respective governments due to the second wave. Meanwhile, even domestic passenger footfalls dropped from 3.16 lakh to 1.32 lakh, down 58%. According to travel agents and tour operators, apprehensions about air travel were significant due to the second wave. “Whoever travelled, did so because of an emergency. Leisure travel came to a standstill due to the lockdown and territorial restrictions in various states,” said an Ahmedabad-based travel agent. “People were extremely scared of travelling.” Travel agents and airport sources revealed that mandatory RT-PCR negative report sought in various states have deterred passengers from travelling. As a consequence, the movement of travellers went down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/flier-movement-crashed-by-60-in-may/articleshow/84216720.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pvt hosps can get vax delivered directly from manufacturers||Mumbai: Private hospitals will now be able to procure slightly higher volumes of vaccines as the Centre has revised the formula for calculating the ‘maximum order quantity’. The Centre has developed two criteria for deciding the MOQ. Firstly, for hospitals that are already vaccinating since the past few months, performance from one of their best performing weeks will be taken as a benchmark to derive their MOQ. Secondly, for newer centres, their bed capacity will be used as a criterion. Hospitals with less than 50 beds can order up to 3,000 doses at the most, 51-300 bed hospitals can order 6,000 doses, 301-500 bed hospitals can buy up to 10,000 doses and hospitals with more than 500 beds can order 15,000.It has also been clarified that the vaccine delivery could happen either from the manufacturers directly or through the state or corporation delivery channel. A private hospital head told TOI if they are opting for delivery through the state government or the BMC, a hospital can place a minimum order of 160 doses of Covaxin and 500 doses of Covishield. If they want direct delivery from the manufacturers, though, they have to order at least 2,880 doses of Covaxin and 6,000 doses of Covishield. Payment will go to the manufacturers directly.Importantly, state immunisation officials will have access to information about how many vaccine orders have been placed by private hospitals, their payment status and how soon the deliveries will be made.Another CEO of a private hospital said the new formula is logical and performance-driven. “It will stop hoarding,” he said. He added that vaccinations done through tie-ups will not be considered while deciding the maximum order eligibility of a hospital. “It will purely be based on vaccinations done at the hospital,” he said. The state official said since hospitals can place a minimum order of 160 and 500 doses, it will empower even smaller players to procure doses. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said the private hospital supply may be streamlined by this week.Vaccination has slowed in the private sector since a few weeks as more doses started to come to public centres. The private sector can procure 25% doses produced in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pvt-hosps-can-get-vax-delivered-directly-from-manufacturers/articleshow/84216707.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala govt shuffles out four revenue officials||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In an apparently vengeful move, the government has transferred four officials from the revenue department, including the official who had written a note citing all the law points against the order issued by the department that was used for illegal felling of the trees. In the transfer order issued by the government on Tuesday, the government has shunted out additional secretaries Girija Kumari G, Bency J and Santhosh Kumar T K and under-secretary Simi Jose from the department. Another under-secretary in the revenue department, Salini, who had parted with the copy of the file of the revenue department regarding the tree felling order, under the Right To Information Act, has availed leave for two months. Sources said that she had to proceed on leave after she was admonished by the higher-ups. (From Left) V Venu and Biswanath SinhaGirija Kumari had written a strong note against issuing the order dated October 24, last year, that became controversial after it was used for illegally felling hundreds of trees from the land that was assigned to farmers. The officer had written in the file that the land revenue commissionerate has been asked to prepare a draft amendment of Kerala Land Assignment Rules, 1964, in order to confer the ownership of all the trees that have been planted or had grown naturally, to the farmers to whom the land has been assigned. Also, the law department and the additional advocate general have been consulted on the legal veracity of amending the 1964 rules. The officer also wrote further that the revenue department’s circular that was issued on March 11, 2020, to clarify permitting the farmers to cut down all the trees that have been planted by the farmers and those naturally grown, has been stayed by the high court on July 8, 2020. Under these circumstances, issuing such an order (of October 24, 2020) would not be in conformity with the law, and the department should wait till the legal opinion of the additional advocate general and the decision of the court, the officer had written. However, the department had issued the order ignoring these observations on the instructions of the then revenue minister E Chandrasekharan. The officer has now been transferred to the higher education department, in a mutual transfer. Another additional secretary Bency, who is also the president of pro-UDF Kerala Secretariat Association (KSA) and also the convener of secretariat action council has been shunted out to a post outside the secretariat. He has been transferred as secretary of Kerala state farmers’ debt relief commission. The council had demanded action against principal secretary (revenue) A Jayathilak. A pamphlet alleging that the revenue secretary verbally harassed the under secretary who issued the copy of the revenue department’s controversial file under RTI Act and demanding action against him, was distributed on behalf of the action council among the secretariat employees on Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, the KSA has submitted a representation to the chief minister citing that the transfer of Bency is illegal as the office bearer of a recognised service organisation of the secretariat employees should be appointed in the headquarters itself. It requested that the chief minister should immediately intervene in the matter and take steps to retain the officer in the secretariat itself. The officer is due for retirement in another eight months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-shunts-out-4-revenue-officials/articleshow/84216727.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Delhi||Delhi: AAP, BJP spar over midday meal ration||NEW DELHI: AAP alleged on Wednesday that the BJP-led North Delhi Municipal Corporation hadn’t distributed midday meal ration among students for the entire last year. BJP, however, claimed that the ration was distributed till March 2021 and it would resume in the next four-five days. AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj demanded that BJP should answer to the 3.5 lakh children at 700 north corporation schools. “In Delhi government and corporation schools, midday meals are served to children. However, due to Covid-19, all schools had remained shut, so Delhi government decided to give the children their due share in the form of dry ration,” said Bharadwaj. All Delhi government schools had ensured distribution of dry ration among their students last year, he claimed. “This practice is also being carried out this year.” BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the corporation had already sent dry ration to most of its schools. “It last distributed dry ration among students in March 2021 after which the agreement with the NGO distributing midday meal had got over. New arrangements took time due to the lockdown. The ration will now be distributed every month.” He alleged that dry ration was also not being distributed in most Delhi government schools and asked Bharadwaj to regularise it before accusing the north corporation. “Even in Saurabh Bharadwaj’s own GK assembly constituency, the distribution is erratic,” he claimed. Bharadwaj alleged that the corporation was supposed to distribute 2,924 tonnes of ration, but hadn’t distributed even one kg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-bjp-spar-over-midday-meal-ration/articleshow/84218845.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Discharge from illegal jeans dyeing units behind frothing in Yamuna||NEW DELHI: While sewage discharged into the river accounts for much of the Yamuna’s pollution, the froth on its surface comes from an entirely different source —illegal jeans dyeing units. These mostly operate without a ‘consent to operate’ certificate or have an effluent treatment plant in place. Water discharged by such units, therefore, is high in ammonia and phosphates compounds, which are not only toxic for aquatic life, but also the cause of the thick foam on the river water. Following a plea in National Green Tribunal in 2019, Delhi Pollution Control Committee was asked to act against all illegal jeans dyeing and washing units in the city. Till date, 155 have been issued closure orders after recent detection of these polluting units in the Khayala, Bawana, Narela and the Badli industrial areas to add to those found in the past two years in Sarita Vihar, Mayapuri and Nangli Sakrawat. Drives were conducted in Khayala on Tuesday and Thursday. A DPCC official said that so far, the illegal units, most without effluent treatment plants, had been fined Rs 3.08 crores. More than six units were closed and others served notices. “More closure notices will be served in the next few months,” declared the official. Varun Gulati, the petitioner in the NGT case who also took part in the crackdown at Khayala, says groundwater is the first to suffer in areas at some distance from the Yamuna. “Drains where these units discharge waste are frothing and the dyes turn the colour of the water to red or pink,” said Gulati. “Each day, hundreds of thousands of litres are being discharged into the Yamuna. This needs to be stopped to improve the river and ground water quality.” Bhim Singh Rawat, a Yamuna activist and member of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), pointed out that while organic pollution through sewage could still be diluted by increasing the water flow, toxic dyes and chemicals not only killed good bacteria in the river water but also affected the Yamuna’s self-cleaning’ property. “If there is organic waste, the river has the capacity to clean itself,” Rawat said. “But this is not possible with chemical pollution. The dyes cannot be washed away and do not break down naturally, causing harm both to aquatic life and humans.” Delhi’s animal husbandry department recently banned fishing at two highly polluted points in the Yamuna where the fish were likely to be toxic. DPCC too banned the sale of soaps and detergents that did not meet the Bureau of Indian Standards norms to check froth formation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dye-another-day/articleshow/84251466.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Madurai||HC stumbles on rampant land sale fraud in TN cooperative societies||MADURAI: Slamming frauds in cooperative societies, where premium lands are sold off for a song by elected office-bearers and staff members, Madras high court has ordered a thorough audit of all sale transactions of all societies in the state. Justice N Anand Venkatesh dismissed a petition filed by R V Shanmuganandam who sought for a direction to Tiruchirappalli Cooperative House Construction Societies Limited to execute the sale deed of a property at Tennur village in his favour. He relied on a ‘compromise decree’ of principal district munsif court at Trichy in 2010. Calling it a classic case where valuable land parcels are sold at throwaway prices by conspirators, the judge imposed an exemplary cost of Rs 10 lakh, which would be payable to the Chief Minister's Public Relief Fund. As a corruption case had been registered against the secretary and members of the society in 2020, the judge directed officials to expedite the investigation and file a final report against all accused within three months. The modus operandi is that once a suit is initiated in a civil court, a ‘compromise’ deed is filed wherein the society would ‘agree’ to convey the property in favour of the buyers. Flaying the practice, the judge directed the authorities to immediately set aside the ‘compromise’ decree vitiated by fraud. He said: "If cases of this nature are let off without taking stringent action, the cooperative movement in the state will suffer and it will ultimately end in closing down societies which are already on the brink of precipice." "The bane that afflicts the cooperative movement in this state is mainly attributable to misappropriation and manipulation of the funds of the society by the office-bearers and staff working in the society," Justice Anand Venkatesh said. The judge expressed shock at the Trichy case, and pointed out that the petitioner had bought a property measuring 7,800sqft for Rs 62.5 lakh from the society in 2015, only to sell it to another person for Rs 2.3 crore within 21 days. The secretary executed yet another sale deed to the petitioner for a land measuring 10,048sqft for Rs 80.59 lakh. Two other sale deeds were executed in the same year to another man named Thirisangu by the society. The judge observed that since the authorities came to know the conspiracy which caused a loss of Rs 6.2 crore to the society, an administrator was appointed and he refused to execute the sale deeds, on the ground that the sale deed is not binding on the society. He cited a government order issued in 2009 mandating that properties of societies could not be sold below the price fixed by the pricing committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-stumbles-on-rampant-land-sale-fraud-in-tn-cooperative-societies/articleshow/84216728.cms||Kaushik Kannan

In the counter, the health secretary stated that the state government would examine the proposals subject to feasibility, based on the outcome of the meeting. With regard to commencing outpatient department (OPD) services in a temporary campus, a detailed report would be finalised and the next level meeting would be held on July 16. It is anticipated that the matter would also be discussed in the meeting. He further stated that the state is proactive in providing land and other regulatory clearances as and when received. The state government would be pleased if the actual construction of AIIMS is expedited and necessary approval is obtained for providing services and also allowing admission in college. A division bench of justice T S Sivagnanam and justice S Ananthi said in the light of the stand taken by the state, the court was deferring the hearing in the case till July 26 and directed the state to file a status report in this regard. During the previous hearing, the secretary of the Union ministry of health and family welfare in the counter affidavit had stated that they were keen on starting services of AIIMS Madurai subject to availability of alternate space for starting MBBS classes and OPD services. The court had requested the state health secretary to consider the stand taken by the Centre as a positive request or a keen willingness to provide OPD services and to start MBBS classes and sought response in this regard. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by K Pushpavanam, a law student in Madurai district, seeking to establish a temporary campus for AIIMS Madurai to provide OPD services and to commence MBBS courses, similar to that provided in other AIIMS in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/aiimss-body-will-discuss-centres-proposals-hc-told/articleshow/84216702.cms||Kaushik Kannan

In 2008-09, the trust had requested the state government for construction of an aerial ropeway for the benefit of pilgrims.In 2011, the government awarded the contract to Mars Entertainment when there were two bidders, the other being Usha Breco Ltd. The temple trust and Usha Breco approached the HC and the state government rescinded its notification. Since then, the project was on hold.On April 5, the government issued a notification by which the construction project was awarded once again to Mars Entertainment.The temple trust submitted that the ropeway construction has been planned in utter disregard of safety, security and technical feasibility alignments. It has not taken into consideration the rush of pilgrims. In 2011, Mars Entertainment had no experience of such project, and Usha Breco’s proposal was rejected saying that the mono-cable detachable type ropeway proposed by it was inferior to Mars Entertainment’s system. However, a decade later, Mars Entertainment has proposed the same type of ropeway.Besides, it was contended that the layout, including installation of the poles and stringing of wires will be passing through a wildlife sanctuary and it would cause damage to the sanctuary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-issues-notice-after-chotila-temple-questions-ropeway-construction-contract/articleshow/84216764.cms||---

Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has imposed a total environmental damage compensation of Rs 12.05 crore on a dozen CETPs for not meeting the green parameters. Experts say as the CETPs are not meeting water quality standards, untreated effluent containing heavy metals enters the Yamuna through drains. According to DPCC, a monthly analysis reports show 12 CETPs have not been meeting prescribed water quality standard in terms of biochemical dissolved oxygen (BOD), total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), chloride and sulphide. Some of them are non-functioning properly. The analysis by the environment department shows that industries in 17 areas are connected to these plants. The 13 CETPs have a total capacity of treating effluent of 212.3 MLD. Manoj Mishra, convenor of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, said, “The basic purpose of CETPs is to treat the effluent released from industries. Without treatment, the polluted water coming from industries containing heavy metals reaches Yamuna. As the industrial effluents are toxic, it is harmful for living entities, including humans. Any person who uses the untreated water will consume the heavy metals and it can cause diseases.” Mishra said ideally wastewater should be treated and given back to industries for reuse so that there is zero liquid discharge. Bhim Singh Rawat, a Yamuna activist and part of South Asia Network on Dams, River and People, told TOI, “Returning treated water to industries help in reducing the dependence of industries on fresh water.” He added that CETPs not complying with water quality parameters and polluting rivers is a problem faced across the country. A DPCC official said, “As per our analysis, 12 CETPs have been found not complying with prescribed effluent standards even after repeated directions. We have imposed a fine of Rs 12.05 crore. Eleven CETP Societies and two operators of plants at Narela and Bawana have also been directed to take immediate necessary rectification measures to meet the prescribed standards.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/effluent-treatment-plants-fail-to-meet-norms/articleshow/84251506.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

At a meet-the-press programme here on Wednesday, the opposition leader asked if it was a Stalinist-model rule in the state under chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who is taking action against officials who have parted with information under the RTI Act. He said that the RTI Act has been passed by the Parliament, and when questions under the act are asked, the officials are duty-bound to answer them. He said that the government has no powers to take action against the officials in this matter. Such a move is to threaten officials that if any information regarding corruption in the LDF government goes out, they will have to face consequences, he added. Satheesan said that documents that prove that the then revenue minister E Chandrasekharan was behind the illegal tree felling order have come out, but the chief minister has not taken any action yet. Satheesan said that there is a lack of transparency regarding the reporting of Covid-19 deaths in the state. The state government is recording Covid-19 deaths in violation of the ICMR guidelines. He said that the government should revise the full list of deaths due to Covid-19 since the first wave, on the basis of ICMR guidelines. He said that the government has been hiding the names of those who lost their lives due to Covid-19 since December last year. He asked if it was some secret agenda to hide such legitimate data. Satheesan said that the Kodakara hawala money case and the gold smuggling case are progressing only at a snail’s pace. All these cases are moving in a direction where these would be compromised and settled between CPM and BJP, Satheesan alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/satheesan-slams-officials-transfers/articleshow/84216772.cms||---
---||Delhi||NDMC puts on hold plans to install 625 smart poles||New Delhi: New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC)’s ambitious project to install 625 smart poles at prominent locations has been put on hold due to lack of technical and financial viability. These poles were supposed to have features like WiFi, panic button, high-density cameras, streetlights, touchscreen information panels and environment censors. Officials of the civic body said that the concessionaire didn’t agree to provide these services at 625 smart poles for free, which was one of the reasons the project couldn’t take off. “Also, no consensus was reached over who will bear the cost of repair work after laying down underground cables. We were also demanding 50% revenue generated through advertisements on the smart touch panels,” said an NDMC official. The project of smart poles made headlines in 2018 after 55 poles were installed in Connaught Place and neighbouring areas under the Centre’s Smart City Mission. Later in 2019, NDMC announced plans to install 625 more smart poles. These were planned to be erected near gates of 43 school buildings, 16 Metro stations and prominent markets and other sensitive spots as a means of additional security. After announcing the project, NDMC floated tenders and received 5-6 bids. “But everyone had certain conditions. The bidders also wanted the permission for installing poles of 20-24 metres height instead of existing 12 metres. But this much height of the tower will not only damage the aesthetics but also lead to other issues for us,” said the official.

It takes less time for the bins to be cleared at night since the vehicles can make trips faster due to less congestion on the roads. While it took eight hours during day time, it takes only three hours at night,” he said.“There have been a few accidents involving garbage vehicles in the city recently. We expect such incidents can be averted when vehicles are operated at night. Moreover, people involved in garbage collection in the mornings find it difficult as the bins are already overflowing. They would not face the issue any more. A few vehicles are allowed to operate during day time to clear bins as and when they get filled up,” the commissioner said. He said that Madurai city has many narrow roads and parking the trucks on the roadside in the mornings, creates a bottleneck for other vehicles. Karthikeyan added that the ultimate aim of the corporation is to make the city dumper bin-free by improving door-to-door collection. The civic body has 140 trucks and 10 tractors for garbage clearance. In addition, 30 hired tractors are being deployed on a regular basis. Out of the 150 vehicles belonging to the corporation, only 120 are being used regularly, while the rest are kept for alternative use in case vehicles break down or sent for servicing.The city generates around 650 tonnes of garbage on an average every day. There are 1,250 dumper bins and 250 compact bins in the city. The garbage is shifted to Vellaikkal solid waste management plant for scientific disposal. In addition, there are 31 micro composting centres to deal with the garbage collected from door-to-door collections in certain localities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-corporation-begins-clearing-waste-bins-during-night/articleshow/84216794.cms||V Devanathan

However, there is no restriction on tourists visiting Kodaikanal. The state government had lifted travel restrictions from Monday onwards as the Covid-19 cases have been coming down. Hoteliers have been allowed to use 50% of capacity for accommodation and dine-in restaurants. While tourist places such as boating, Coakers Walk, Pillar Rocks and Guna caves are not opened yet, the district administration had allowed people to visit parks such as Bryant Park, Rose Garden and Chettiyar Park. But, the surge in crowds on Tuesday forced the administration to ban visitors from Wednesday onwards. “People were not wearing masks and not following social distancing despite reminders. Since it was difficult to make them follow the precautionary measures, there was no other option but to close the parks,” an official said. Meanwhile, hoteliers said that most of the tourists are day travellers and hence there was not much business. Those staying overnight in the hill station are preferring resorts than hotels, a hotelier said. S Abdul Kani Raja, secretary of Kodaikanal hoteliers association said that they are ensuring that their staff wear masks, gloves and frequently sanitise their hands in order to ensure the safety of their guests.

---||Jaipur||Take voice samples of Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, says Rajasthan high court||JAIPUR: The chief metropolitan magistrate court here on Wednesday directed the additional chief judicial magistrate to take steps to get voice samples of Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and alleged middleman Sanjay Jain in the MLA bribery case. The court order follows an application by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB), seeking directions to take voice samples of the duo as the investigation had been hampered by the resistance of Shekhawat and Jain to provide the same. The special operations group (SOG) of Rajasthan police had registered three FIRs on complaints lodged by Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi. Two of the accused were arrested in the first case, registered on July 10 last year. A notice was sent to the then deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot for recording his statement in connection with the matter, which led to the rebellion by Pilot and 18 MLAs. Two other cases of sedition and criminal conspiracy were registered on July 17 after some audio tapes containing telephonic conversations allegedly about horse trading of MLAs were leaked. One of these FIRs named alleged middleman Jain, Congress Sardarshahar MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma and one Gajendra Singh, who the Congress claimed was Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. Following the compromise worked out by the Congress central leadership with the rebel faction led by Pilot, the SOG dropped the charge of sedition but transferred the case to ACB to investigate corruption charges. The ACB has been trying to get the voice samples of both Shekhawat and Jain but to no avail. Therefore, it approached the court for a direction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/take-voice-samples-of-union-minister-shekhawat-raj-court/articleshow/84218906.cms||Joychen Joseph

---||Hyderabad||Telangana’s liquor revenue doubled in four years||HYDERABAD: A look at annual income from liquor sales shows Telangana doubled the revenue in a span of just four years since it gained statehood. However, figures also show that monthly income from liquor has gone down by Rs 300crore-Rs 400crore in the past one year because of economic slowdown and steep hike in prices. When the state was formed, the annual liquor sale volume was Rs 10,863 crore. The total volume increased every year until 2017-18, when it dropped to Rs 9,639 crore. However, in the following year (2018-19), total liquor sale jumped to Rs 20,859 crore. This was the first time the state netted more than Rs 20,000 income from liquor sales. Currently, despite the Covid-19 induced slowdown in liquor sales, the state expected to generate Rs 2,700 crore income per month. But the income has been hovering around the Rs 2,300 crore per month mark. The state government wanted to increase the sales and income by reducing the prices. Sources in the government say there are many more measures being proposed by state government to improve sales. Statistics shows that sale volume crossed the Rs 2,000 crore per month mark for the first time in October 2017 (Rs 2,977 crore). Since then, till September 2019-20, the sales crossed that mark several times, but not consistently. In April 2019-20, the total sale volume stood at Rs 1,854 crore, which gradually climbed to Rs 2,430 in September that year. Since then, the state has been earning above Rs 2,000 crore nearly every month, barring few during lockdown in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ts-liquor-revenue-doubled-in-4-years/articleshow/84218954.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Kochi||Kerala: File cases against farmers, DFO tells range officers||IDUKKI: Forest officials have begun investigation after direction from higher officials to register cases against farmers and others for illegally felling trees in title deed lands. According to forest department sources, divisional forest officers (DFO) issued an order directing range officers to register cases in each region with immediate effect. Munnar DFO issued an order to Devikulam, Adimali and Neriamangalam range officers directing to register cases against tree felling in their region. TOI has accessed a copy of the order stating, “Using the shield of revenue department order of October 24, 2020, large-scale felling of trees like rosewood and teak occurred in various regions. Since there is loss of government-owned trees, the head of the forest force, principal forest conservator and chief forest conservator high range circle are directed to register cases against the tree felling. The concerned officials should register a case and report immediately,” said the order. Based on the new order, range officers have begun registering cases against persons, including farmers, who felled trees from their title deed lands after the revenue department’s order, sources said. “The department directed range officers to register cases against farmers, even though they felled trees after the revenue department’s order, and save their own positions. Some officials are reluctant to register cases against farmers. When issuing title deeds it is clearly mentioned that rosewood, teak and ebony are under the government’s ownership. Directions were to register cases using violation of title deed,” said a top forest department official. Idukki district collector H Dinesan told TOI that there is no ground to register cases against farmers in the tree felling issue. High Range Samrakshana Samithy general convener Fr Sebastian Kochupurakal said, “The farmers felled trees from their lands as per revenue department order. We will protest forest department’s move to register cases against farmers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/file-cases-against-farmers-dfo-tells-range-officers/articleshow/84216828.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Shally Makin, a young entrepreneur running her own travel company ‘Rootsvida’ in Dehradun, told TOI, “We are taking smaller groups of people and ensuring that our trekkers don't come in contact with the locals to avoid the possibility of the transmission of the virus.” She added that she has been able to create a ‘bubble vacation’ for the hikers, taking into account all the necessary Covid protocols. In a similar vein, Ankush Rawat, who runs ‘Outdoor Monks’ trekking company in Dehradun, said, “We take utmost precaution to ensure that our travel guides and trekkers are safe. Our guides are tested for Covid-19 once a week and their temperatures are taken regularly. Besides, we provide our trekkers with small kits that comprise a reusable mask, a sanitiser, and some antibiotics.

Other companies like IndiaHikes and Himalaya Trekkers are also taking similar precautions and have put in place Covid-19 protocols for trekkers on their websites. All companies have made RT-PCR negative report mandatory. However, villagers in the hills have expressed concern regarding trekking and other tourism activities in the hills. They say that their villages have no medical facilities and if the virus spreads, it will be catastrophic in villages.

Cops reached the location and traced the deceased’s family members who identified him as Sandeep Mehto. His father works as a cab driver. Prima facie, it appears that Mehto who lived on a plot nearby had entered the farmhouse with his friends allegedly with an intention to steal when they were caught by the guard and the owner. While his friends managed to escape, he was caught and thrashed. Some stray dogs bit him while he was leaving and just 50 metres from the farmhouse, the victim collapsed.

---||Delhi||Delhi’s second genome lab inaugurated at ILBS||New Delhi: The capital’s second state-of-the-art genome sequencing facility was inaugurated at Institute of Liver and Biliary Services (ILBS) by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday. The first such facility was opened at Lok Nayak Hospital a day earlier. Both facilities will end Delhi’s dependence on National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to get samples tested. Genome sequencing is important as new variants and mutations of Covid-19 have been emerging frequently. “The first set of results will come in 4-5 days. The ILBS facility is more advanced that the one at Lok Nayak Hospital. Till now, we were dependent on NCDC and other labs of the central government. Now, we will be able to identify and analyse all Covid-19 variants for any future waves and enable Delhi government to make strategies and advance preparations to avert deaths and infection,” said Kejriwal. The ILBS facility would be able to sequence nearly all 30,000 molecules of SARS CoV2 with the help of the latest machines called NextSeq and MiSeq. This will help find mutations in any part of the virus, not merely the spike protein area. The ILBS facility can sequence more than 300 samples every week and give results within 5-7 days. The sequencing done with clinical significance would help in classification of new strains or variants circulating in Delhi-NCR. Later, Kejriwal tweeted that the labs would help in identification and detection of the severity of any new variant of the virus and Delhiites would benefit a lot from this technology. Explaining the genome sequencing process, Dr Shiv Kumar Sarin, director of ILBS, said, “After RT-PCR tests, we will preserve the RNA and sequence the virus. This will help us decide whether the variant is new or an existing one. Not every strain is extremely dangerous, but we need to be well informed about the new cases coming to Delhi and their variants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhis-second-genome-lab-inaugurated-at-ilbs/articleshow/84251549.cms||AlokKNMishra

He went to the extent of stating that four crore people of Telangana need to build a temple to Sonia Gandhi in their hearts and that every house in the state should have a portrait of her. “In fact, Sonia Gandhi is our Telangana Talli. Even if someone offers a glass of water to us, we don’t forget it for life time. Sonia Gandhi fulfilled 60-year dream of Telangana state. It is our responsibility to thank her,” he said. In the same breath, Revanth called upon the youth and party workers to take a two-year holiday from their homes, to work hard and bring Congress to power in the state as well as the country. “Tell your parents and family members that you are going to work for the nation and state, and that you will carry the Congress flag high. If we work hard day and night by even sacrificing our sleep, we can bring Congress to power in the state and at the national level,” Revanth said. Addressing party leaders, workers and people after formally taking charge as TPCC president, Revanth said: “None of us have seen Telangana Talli. The only visible Talli to our eyes is Sonia Gandhi who fulfilled the 60-year-old dream and aspiration of four crore people of Telangana by granting statehood,” he said. “Knock every heart in the state and tell them the cost paid by the Congress to give statehood.

The 36-year-old woman who had learning difficulties gave birth to her second baby after she was rescued in Tuticorin in 2018. The reunion was emotional as the woman and her kids met Kusha Bhoi, 45, who was accompanied by police personnel. The family thanked the officials and representatives of One Stop Centre for taking care of them and helping them get back together. Shelin George, head of One Stop Centre, said Bilashi was rescued in July 2018. “She was admitted to Thoothukudi medical college hospital as she was pregnant and her daughter Ankita Bhoi (now seven years old) was taken to a home for children, where she started schooling. In August, Bilashi gave birth to a special child,” she said. The three lived in different homes with dedicated care. The special child could not be raised by her mother as both of them had learning difficulties. Tracing the family was not difficult though Bilashi’s delayed recovery was a big hurdle. “She mentioned about Odisha a few months ago. As she could only speak her native tribal language, we brought in a translator. We shared Bilashi’s details and picture taken at the time of her rescue with Odisha police,” Shelin said. The identical green tattoo in her hand was a clue that helped the police trace her. About three months ago, the Odisha police informed her husband Kusha and their family about Bilashi and the kids. The pandemic delayed Kusha’s arrival in Tuticorin till Tuesday. The family was given a warm send-off in the presence of Tuticorin collector K Senthil Raj with a cake cutting and a bunch of gifts including dresses for the kids. Like Bilashi, there are 15 more women from other states in Tuticorin who wait to be reunited with their families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/reunited-after-3-years-odisha-woman-hubby-return-with-kids/articleshow/84216810.cms||M K Ananth

As the first 15 connections were cut, locals resisted, and the police were called in. “...the power firm should take a sympathetic view and give relief during pandemic,” said Bhagwan Garud, a local. Another resident said: “Officials should not be harsh as some have children who study online while there are senior citizens who will feel miserable in humid weather.” A senior Adani official, however, said that the 700 consumers were given “enough time and show-cause notices” to pay pending bills, and this was the ultimate step. He said that in 2019, residents supported by political parties agreed to clear bills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fracas-as-firm-cuts-power-for-unpaid-bills/articleshow/84219192.cms||Somit Sen

---||Agra||Former sub-inspector and Agra MP SP Singh Baghel gets ministerial berth||Agra: A sub-inspector in UP police, a professor of military science and a five-time member of parliament, Satya Pal Singh Baghel has donned many hats in his career, but the 61-year-old’s “biggest achievement” came on Wednesday as he was inducted into the Union council of ministers. “I’m thankful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for providing me the opportunity to serve the people of the country in a better way. This is the happiest moment of my life and my biggest achievement yet. I will not leave any stone unturned in doing justice to my portfolio,” the BJP MP from Agra told TOI. He has been given MoS (law and justice). Baghel, who hails from Auraiya district, is known for his oratory as much as he is known for his party hopping. He was a member of the Lok Sabha in 1998, 1999 and 2004 as a Samajwadi Party MP and represented the Jalesar seat. In 2009, Baghel joined Bahujan Samaj Party and was elected to the Rajya Sabha as a BSP nominee. But in 2014, Baghel resigned as BSP Rajya Sabha MP after contesting and losing Lok Sabha elections from Firozabad. Soon after, he aligned himself with the BJP. In 2015, he was appointed the president of BJP OBC Morcha. In 2017, he won the assembly elections from Tundla seat and served as a minister (animal husbandry) in Yogi Adityanath’s cabinet. In 2019, he was fielded by the BJP from the Agra Lok Sabha seat (SC) — replacing the incumbent Ram Shankar Katheria, the then chief of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes. Baghel managed to notch a major victory, defeating the BSP candidate Manoj Kumar Soni by over two lakh votes. Back in the 90s, however, the local intelligence unit (LIU) sleuth had few political aspirations. He had joined UP Police as sub-inspector soon after completing his MSc. It was only when he was serving as a security officer to former chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav that his political ambitions started taking shape. He took voluntary retirement from police in 1993 and was appointed the state president of Samajwadi Party’s youth brigade. A PhD in military science, Baghel is also a professor at Agra College. Baghel’s political career, however, hasn’t remained free of controversy. A case is pending in court against him after it was alleged that he had contested elections on a forged caste certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/former-sub-inspector-and-agra-mp-sp-singh-baghel-gets-ministerial-berth/articleshow/84214366.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Delhi||Cabinet reshuffle: Firebrand Meenakshi Lekhi inducted as minister; Harsh Vardhan dropped||NEW DELHI: Firebrand BJP leader Meenakshi Lekhi, who was elected for a second consecutive term as MP from the New Delhi seat, was inducted into the Union cabinet on Wednesday while health minister and Chandni Chowk MP Dr Harsh Vardhan was dropped in the cabinet reshuffle. Fifty-four-year-old Lekhi, who has been appointed as minister of state for external affairs and culture, is seen in the party as a trenchant critic of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and a bulwark against the AAP government which BJP perceives as a threat in the capital. Dr Harsh Vardhan, a mild-mannered individual, had recently worked himself up into a fury against AAP during the Covid-19 pandemic. Lekhi, who is a Supreme Court lawyer and a good orator, has been active in local party activities, especially those directed against the AAP government. Around 10 days ago, she sat on a dharna along with other Delhi BJP leaders at Jantar Mantar, alleging that the AAP government had faked the oxygen shortage to hide its own shortcomings during the peak of the second Covid-19 wave. Last year when Kejriwal claimed that he was put under house arrest to stop him from visiting the protesting farmers, Lekhi accused him of doing drama. She has attacked the AAP government on various issues like ration distribution, air pollution, dengue, criticism of farm laws etc. As a lawyer, the Delhi University graduate who was born and brought up in Delhi, has taken up cases related to many significant issues like permanent commission for women officers in the armed forces. She was appointed BJP’s national spokesperson in 2013. Before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Lekhi won praise of top BJP leaders after her contempt petition against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for attributing his personal jibe against Prime Minister to the Supreme Court forced the Congress leader to tender an apology. Before joining politics, Lekhi was associated with several NGOs and also worked with Swadeshi Jagaran Manch, an organisation associated with RSS, and was invited by ex-BJP president Nitin Gadkari to join the party. She was appointed vice-president of BJP’s Mahila Morcha in 2010 and her political career took off. She was elected as MP first time in 2014. As a parliamentarian, Lekhi has been part of the drafting committees of important Bills, including Women’s Reservation Bill and Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Bill and has also served on different panels. In July 2019, she was appointed chairperson of the parliamentary committee on public undertakings. She is also a member of New Delhi Municipal Council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/firebrand-lekhi-inducted-asminister-vardhan-dropped/articleshow/84216890.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Jangaon man’s electric jugaad insulates him from high fuel prices||JANGAON: Hit hard by the pandemic and exasperated with the rising fuel prices, an electronic goods technician here hit upon a unique idea to save money he spends on commuting. Kurapati Vidyasagar replaced the petrol engine of his motorcycle with a converter and batteries, effectively converting it from a petrol-run vehicle to a cost-effective electric bike. During the lockdown, Vidyasagar found it hard to fulfil the needs of his family, which was already struggling below the poverty line. Then, the rising fuel prices came as a body blow. Unable to afford the roughly two litres of petrol he required daily to attend calls from customers across the town, he had almost decided to wind up his repairing centre. He needed to travel to his repairing centre from his and back twice everyday, besides riding to the areas where customers live or work. This is when he stuck upon an idea that eventually turned adversity into opportunity. Vidyasagar somehow pooled in some money to purchase a machine that could convert his bike into an electric one. He bought the machine online for Rs 7,500. He replaced the petrol tank with the machine and connected it to four 30Ah-capacity batteries. Vidyasagar claims he charges the batteries daily for about five hours using just one unit of electricity. Speaking to TOI, he said his bike can cover a distance of 50km with the charged batteries. One of his colleagues, Anil, who is a motor vehicle mechanic, assisted him in making the bike electric. The batteries on the two-wheeler charge automatically as they had used a dynamo. Vidyasagar said his daily expenditure of nearly Rs 200 on fuel has come down to Rs 10 per unit of electricity. Many citizens have said he should be helped by the government or charitable institutions.

The exercise is likely to cost the government Rs 25 crore. A cabinet note stated that due to the lockdown and curfew, many who carry out their work in traditional businesses of Goa, as well as in the marginalised and unorganised sectors, have lost their livelihood. It’s therefore the social responsibility of the government to extend one-time financial help to them, the note said. “It is expected that nearly 50,000 persons involved in these sectors, (or) involved in carrying out traditional occupations or traditional businesses of Goa, lost their livelihood or source of earning,” the note said. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the state government is expecting at least 25,000-30,000 people to apply under the scheme. Sawant said that autorickshaw drivers, motorcycle taxi riders and others are eligible under this scheme. He said that there is a single-page form to apply. The state cabinet also granted approval for the creation of a department of public-private partnership, which was earlier a PPP cell.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabinet-nod-to-rs-rs-5k-aid-to-those-who-lost-jobs-to-covid/articleshow/84219014.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Tourist rush at Nainital, Mussoorie alarms HC, asks Uttarakhand to review lockdown norms||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday expressed concerns over massive crowds entering hill stations of Nainital and Mussoorie and bringing the “dreaded” Delta plus variant along with them and asked the state to review its decision to ease lockdown restrictions during the weekend. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma cited several media reports which highlighted that at least 25,000 people had visited Nainital last weekend and that barely a fraction of the tourists were wearing masks or following social distancing norms. Many tourists were entering without RT-PCR test reports and in several instances the reports were found to be fake. The court recorded an undertaking by chief secretary SS Sandhu that the issue would be brought to the notice of the government. “The state is further directed to take concrete steps to control the inflow of tourists in the state,” said the bench. Sandhu has been directed to inform the court about the decision of the government, if any, about tightening of the lockdown during the weekend. The judges were also informed that the state had recorded the first case of Delta plus variant. Health secretary Amit Negi, who was present before the court virtually, said the government had sent around 30 samples to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for genome sequencing and a sample from Udham Singh Nagar tested positive for Delta plus. The bench has directed the health secretary to inform the court about the number of samples sent to NCDC, the results received and the steps taken by the local authorities to deal with the cases. The court has also asked Negi to inform it about the number of pediatric beds available in the state, the number of Covid vaccinations done so far in each district and the arrangement for vaccinating elderly and disabled people. The court also took notice of the low stipend paid to medical college students interning with the state and asked the government to consider the possibility of increasing the stipend. The judges were informed that the intern doctors receive only Rs 7,500 a day in Uttarakhand while in neighbouring Himachal Pradesh the amount was over Rs 17,000. “On one hand, according to Mr Amit Negi, it is difficult to attract the doctors to the state, yet, on the other hand, the stipend being paid to the intern doctors is too low as compared to the other states,” read the court order. The court has directed the government to respond on the issues by July 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tourist-rush-at-nainital-mussoorie-alarms-hc-asks-ukhand-to-review-lockdown-norms/articleshow/84214379.cms||Prashant Jha

The ‘Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology’, the journal of the Indian National Association for the Study of the Liver, carried a research article on the patients who had taken a homemade brew of giloy or readymade formulations available in the market. One of them died. On Wednesday, the Ayush ministry said linking giloy to liver damage would be misleading and disastrous as it has been used in Ayurveda since long. The efficacy of Tinospora Cordifolia, the scientific name for giloy, in managing various disorders is well established, it added. Regarding the study, Ayush said a similar looking herb, Tinospora Crispa, might have a negative effect on the liver. “So, before labelling a herb, such as giloy, with such toxic nature the authors should have tried to correctly identify the plants following the standard guidelines, which they did not,” it said. “There are hundreds of studies on Giloy and its safe use,” Ayush officials said. The study’s lead author Dr Aabha Nagral said while the ministry has raised the issue of patients consuming another similar looking herb “it cannot explain the severe liver toxicity in the two patients taking commercial preparations labelled Tinospora Cordifolia (giloy) in the recommended doses.” One of these patients died, she added. “Assuming the plant mistakenly ingested by some patients is crispa instead of cordifolia, it is incumbent on the ministry to warn people to stop self-medicating themselves with giloy and use it under supervision,” said Dr Nagral. The doctor said her research didn’t suggest “giloy should not be used” or it “is not effective”. She said any drug that is otherwise useful can still have major side effects in some individuals. “In our paper, we have advised caution and monitoring of liver tests in a high-risk population of those with autoimmune disorders, especially when giloy is being promoted and ingested in large numbers during the Covid-19 pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-linking-giloy-to-liver-injury-misleading-says-ayush-min/articleshow/84216892.cms||---

He held a meeting with officials including collectors of Madurai and Theni and Madurai corporation commissioner at the district collectorate to discuss the progress of Amrut drinking water project to draw 125 MLD water from Mullaperiyar dam. The minister told reporters that 2.19 lakh acres of land belonging to farmers in Madurai, Dindigul, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram has ayacut rights from the water released in the river. Due to the water theft, which has been taking place for 10 years, many small-scale farmers lost their livelihood. It also resulted in forced migration of people in villages to urban areas. He said that in 2016 he had written to then chief minister J Jayalalithaa on the scale at which the water theft was taking place. Officials disconnected illegal electric connections then which led to increase in water received in the waterbody by 160 cusecs a day. However, the theft resumed after her demise and the officials did not take any action. “You know who was in power and who was the powerful man in the district (Theni) during the last rule. Either it has taken place with his full knowledge or he was so careless to take a note on it. Many influential people and officials should have been involved in the industrial-strength water theft. It is treachery to the farmers in particular and society at large,” he said. After DMK formed the government, he took the issue to the notice of the chief minister who ordered appropriate action. In a study conducted recently it was found that water theft is taking place at 527 places. Powerful motors are being used to lift water through pipelines for up to 12 kms. Gigantic tanks have been constructed to store water. Up to 15 horse power motors are being used. “The survey report has been handed over to the Theni district collector for appropriate action. The issue will be taken to the right officials and ministers concerned to take strict action,” he added. The minister said a detailed forensic audit will be conducted to find out what had happened all these years and who all benefited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/power-dept-losing-rs-30l-daily-from-mullaperiyar-water-theft-says-min/articleshow/84216854.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand likely to allow Kanwar Yatra after Yogi Adityanath dials Dhami||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government is in the process of reconsidering its decision to cancel the Kanwar Yatra and allow the pilgrimage to happen, sources familiar with the development told TOI on Wednesday. This follows the announcement by the UP government on Tuesday that it will permit the yatra from July 25 onwards. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had directed officials to coordinate with neighbouring states in this regard. He subsequently dialed his Uttarakhand counterpart Pushkar Dhami as well. Sources told TOI that Adityanath requested Dhami that kanwarias from his state should be allowed in limited numbers to travel to Haridwar to collect water from the Ganga. A senior government official who requested anonymity said that the state government had all but made up its mind to agree to Adityanath’s appeal. “It is unlikely that the state government will turn down the request made by the UP CM. Also, assembly elections are coming up in both UP and Uttarakhand and disappointing the kanwarias, who form a chunk of the vote-base of BJP, can be counter-productive.” Speaking on the issue on Wednesday, Dhami said in Haridwar, “I have called a high-level meeting on Thursday to discuss the Kanwar Yatra. Our aim is to not disappoint the pilgrims.” On being queried whether the Uttarakhand government is planning to seek advice from the central government on the matter, Dhami said, “This is something between UP and Uttarakhand. The UP CM and I have already spoken twice on the issue and, if needed, I will speak to him again on the matter.” The Uttarakhand government had decided to cancel the Kanwar Yatra this year due to the Covid threat and issued an order in this regard on June 30. Last year, too, the yatra had been cancelled due to the coronavirus situation. In 2019, when the yatra had last taken place, over 3.3 crore kanwarias had come to Haridwar --mainly from Haryana, UP, Delhi and Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-likely-to-allow-kanwar-yatra-after-yogi-dials-dhami/articleshow/84214394.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Mumbai||‘Insurance company couple took Rs 40 crore out of a third bank’||MUMBAI: Investigation into the Rs8-crore siphoning of funds from the accounts of United India Insurance Company Ltd. has revealed that the accused husband-wife duo, who worked as assistant managers with the insurance firm, had registered a realty firm in New Delhi earlier this year. Meanwhile, the police have got details of financial transactions from a third bank and found that Rs 40 crore was diverted to different accounts from this bank, said an investigator. The total money diverted so far has gone up to Rs 170 crore, said the officer. Jaideep Sinha, deputy general manager of the insurance company, had lodged an FIR against Singh and others with the Marine Drive police. The case was later transferred to the city’s economic offences wing (EOW). On June 28, the EOW arrested Khushal Singh (38) and his wife Neelam Singh (33) from Pune. Singh worked in the accounts department, while his wife was in the IT department of the insurance firm. Singh had been working with the firm’s Mumbai office since 2016. “While Singh transferred money to various accounts, his wife is one of the beneficiaries,” said a police source. A team supervised by EOW chief Niket Kaushik and investigating officer Mandar Lad is probing the case. Singh was the signatory authority for a bank account. Later, the bank brought some suspicious transactions to the notice of the insurance firm and an inquiry found that more than Rs 8 crore was transferred to Singh’s personal accounts and later to other accounts. Details of another bank account too showed that he had transferred more than Rs 121 crore to various individuals, companies and third parties. This week, police got the report of a third bank account, where Singh was a signatory authority, and found that Rs 40 crore was transferred from this account too. “The total money diverted to more than 70 accounts is up to Rs 170 crore so far,” said an officer, adding Singh had been transferring money for the last couple of years till the FIR was filed in May. “Money has been transferred to the accounts of more than 15 real estate developers in Gurgaon and Noida,” added the officer. He is alleged to have booked 30 plus properties. “We are now seeking details of the company that Singh had registered in New Delhi,” said an officer. Investigators have also sought the passport details of Singh and his wife to find out if they travelled abroad. Police have written to various banks asking them to freeze 70 accounts where the money is suspected to have been diverted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-con-couple-had-registered-realty-company-in-delhi/articleshow/84221579.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Kochi||Ernakulam: August synod to decide on uniform mass celebration||KOCHI: Synod of Syro-Malabar Church, scheduled in August 2021, would decide on an exact date for implementing a uniform mode of celebrating Holy Qurbana in the Church, said Major archbishop Cardinal George Alencherry in a letter on Wednesday. The cardinal’s letter came soon after a letter of Pope Francis to bishops, clergy, religious and laity of the Syro-Malabar Church on the issue was made public in Rome. The cardinal in his letter thanked Pope Francis for recognising the new ‘Raza Qurbana Taksa’, a uniform mode of celebrating the mass. “I am forwarding herewith the letter, Holy Father Pope Francis has written…urging us to promptly implement the uniform mode of celebration of the Holy Qurbana as decided by the Synod held in November 1999,” the cardinal wrote. A singular mode of celebrating mass has long been a bone of contention within the Syro-Malabar Church as various dioceses follow two different modes of celebrating the mass, an obvious difference being the priest facing the churchgoers during the ceremony in certain dioceses and facing the altar in certain other dioceses. The uniform mode would have the priest facing the faithful as well as the altar during the ceremony and the duration of the mass would also be reduced. Pope Francis’s letter dated July 3 was made public on Tuesday. “I willingly take the occasion of the recognition of the new Raza Qurbana Taksa to exhort all the clergy, religious and lay faithful to proceed to a prompt implementation of the uniform mode of celebrating the Holy Qurbana, for the greater good and unity of your Church. May the Holy Spirit foster harmony, fraternity and unity among all members of your Church as you work to implement the Synodal decision,” the letter said. The letter said that the Holy See regards this an important step towards increasing stability and ecclesial communion in the Syro-Malabar Church.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/august-synod-to-decide-on-uniform-mass-celebration/articleshow/84216962.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Ajay Bhatt gets place in Modi's new cabinet, Nishank dropped||DEHRADUN: Senior BJP leader and Member of Parliament from Nainital-Udham Singh Nagar seat, Ajay Bhatt, was inducted in the Narendra Modi cabinet on Wednesday as minister of state. Following Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank’s resignation from the post of education minister, speculations were rife in political circles since morning in Uttarakhand that another Brahmin face from the state may be accommodated. Bhatt is the former president of Uttarakhand BJP and is credited with leading the party to a massive electoral win in the 2017 assembly polls when BJP won 57 seats out of 70. The 60-year-old leader from Kumaon defeated Congress stalwart Harish Rawat by over three lakh votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Before 2017, Bhatt was an MLA from Ranikhet and was the opposition leader in the Uttarakhand legislative assembly. Congratulating Bhatt on becoming Union minister, Uttarakhand BJP president Madan Kaushik said, "I am confident that he will contribute in the development works of Uttarakhand as well as the entire country." In a similar vein, CM Dhami said, “There is no doubt that Uttarakhand will benefit from Ajay Bhatt ji becoming a Union minister.” Bhatt had held several important portfolios, including health minister, in the previous BJP government in Uttarakhand. In March 2021, his name was doing the rounds as a probable candidate for the post of chief minister after Trivendra Singh Rawat resigned from the CM's post. However, he declined he was in the race. Meanwhile, with the exit of Nishank and inclusion of Bhatt, the political centre stage in Uttarakhand has now shifted to Kumaon from Garhwal region. Political analysts say that this seemed like a conscious shift in strategy by the BJP to appease the electorate in Kumaon which had felt left out since two of the previous CMs — Trivendra and Tirath Rawat had been from Garhwal. In order to restore balance between the regions, the party had recently named Dhami as CM. He is from Khatima in Udham Singh Nagar, a district in Kumaon region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ajay-bhatt-gets-place-in-modis-new-cabinet-nishank-dropped/articleshow/84214422.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Delhi||The birds and the fees: Delhi cops to sponsor studies of girl selling feed at Connaught Place||NEW DELHI: A day after TOI reported about a 15-year-old girl selling bird food while immersed in her books in Connaught Place, officers at the local police station, moved by her photograph, decided to sponsor her education and get her enrolled in a girl’s school in the area. I K Jha, the station house officer, called the girl and her mother to the police station on Wednesday and offered all help for Bhumika's schooling. No wonder, the 15-year-old, second youngest among five daughters, says she wants to join the police force later on in life. When TOI visited the police station, Bhumika and her mother, Chanda Devi, were sitting with the SHO. Devi told TOI, “I have five daughters, the eldest one being 23-years old who recently got a job at a shoe factory in Nihal Vihar. She is the sole earning member of the family and gets Rs 7,000 a month. I have separated from my husband and we are not in touch. My other 19-year-old daughter has an eye ailment and stays at home. Bhumika and my fourth daughter share one mobile phone to study online. My youngest daughter, Khushi, is six years old.” The family stays in a one-room house in Nihal Vihar on a rent of Rs 2,000. Bhumika was captured by a TOI photojournalist, Anindya Chattopadhyay sitting on the pavement on Kasturba Gandhi Marg and the photograph caught the eye of the police officers. In the SHO’s room, Bhumika shyly said, “I want to study and fulfil my mother’s dream. The police officers have decided to sponsor my education and have told me they will get me admission into a girl’s school. I usually come along with my mother to help her sell bird food.” Apart from studies, she is also into athletics and is part of the school sports club. SHO Jha reiterated that the officers at the Connaught Place police station would contribute to Bhumika’s education. “We met the family and visited their residence. We will do our best to ensure her dreams are fulfilled,” said Jha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/the-birds-and-the-fees-cp-cops-to-sponsor-studies-of-girl-selling-feed/articleshow/84216981.cms||---

---||Delhi||Mix-up leaves man with two ‘first’ doses in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Lakshman Pandit went to a government school in northwest Delhi’s Qadipur on July 1 to get his second dose of the Covid vaccine. The 59-year-old labourer showed the text message he had got from the CoWin app on his phone to the people there before being administered the shot. Two hours later, his phone beeped. The confirmatory message congratulated him on getting his first dose of Covishield. “I knew for a fact that I had to get the second dose of Covaxin, having got that vaccine earlier. But in the text message, I saw ‘Dose 1’ mentioned. I showed both the messages to an acquaintance in the colony, who confirmed it,” said Pandit. “I had taken the first dose of Covaxin at a dispensary in Mukhmelpur in April. After that there was the lockdown and I returned home to Bihar, taking the provisional vaccination certificate with me. Because of floods affecting our house, I couldn’t save the document certifying I had got the first dose of Covaxin.” When Pandit went to the vaccination centre at the Qadipur school, he showed them the text message he had got after the first dose. So technically, he should have been administered the second dose of Covaxin. But he was given the first dose of Covishield. Vikas Saini, his acquaintance, checked on the CoWin site and confirmed that Pandit had indeed been given the Covaxin shot as a first dose. “Perhaps because there were so many people at the vaccination centre, they made a mistake. But Pandit is very worried,” said Saini. Pandit lives alone in Delhi and claimed to have felt ill after the injection. “Four hours after the vaccination, I got headache, fever and nausea. My mouth felt dry despite drinking a lot of water. Since then I have not been able to eat and feel anxious all the time as if I have stolen something,” said the construction worker. “Since Mukhmelpur is 5km from my home, I had sought a vaccination centre close to where I say.” Worried that he would fall ill, he went back to the centre at Qadipur and informed the authorities of the error. “They tore my earlier paper and changed things on the computer and then asked me to forget about the first vaccine I had taken,” Pandit alleged. “They said I should return for the second dose after 84 days.” The man worried about what would happen to his children if he died. “No, I am not going to return or the second dose now,” he declared. “Mere saath bahut galat huwa na, maine bola tha unko ki mujhe padna nahin aata isliye aap hi check karo (I have been wronged, I had told the vaccination people that I can’t read and asked them to check my earlier details).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mix-up-leaves-man-with-two-first-doses/articleshow/84251753.cms||Shradha Chettri

The SSC results will be based on Class IX and X school performance. But to maintain uniformity, the state has decided to hold an optional Common Entrance Test (CET). The CET score will get preference over SSC and other board marks. However, students from the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) and International Baccalaureate (IB) are worried as the CET will be a 100 marks paper with 25 questions each on English, Maths, Science, and Social Science. An IGCSE science student said attempting social science questions will be difficult as he did not have the subject in his Class X. “IGCSE students choose their stream (science/commerce/arts) in Class IX. Similarly, an IGCSE commerce student will be lost answering science questions,” said a parent, whose son secured 96%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-class-x-students-of-intl-boards-worried-over-cet-for-admission/articleshow/84229563.cms||Sandhya Nair

Ivanhoe Cambridge, an arm of Canadian institutional fund manager Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), and Singapore-based Lighthouse Canton will be investing (80:20) in MN Park that provides R&D laboratory space and innovation infrastructure in Genome Valley. Ivanhoe Cambridge said its investment in MN Park is in line with its global strategy of focusing on sectors that foster innovation and long-term growth fundamentals. “We anticipate that India, and Hyderabad in particular, will further cement its position in the global life sciences arena in the post-pandemic world,” said Chanakya Chakravarti, managing director-India, Ivanhoé Cambridge. Pointing out that this is the first time a global pension fund is investing in life sciences R&D real estate in the country, Sanket Sinha, head-asset management, Lighthouse Canton, Singapore, said the investment reinforces Hyderabad’s leadership position in the life sciences R&D sector. “Our collective vision is to invest $100 million and double the existing infrastructure, thereby adding over 1 million square feet of life sciences facility in the next few years,” Sinha added. The Iavnhoe Cambridge and Lighthouse Canton top honchos also held a virtual meeting with Telangana industries minister KT Rama Rao during the day.

---||Hyderabad||From the cricket pitch to the filmi sets, Hyderabad remembers Dilip Kumar||HYDERABAD: Thespian Dilip Kumar, who passed away in Mumbai on Wednesday, had a long association with Hyderabad. The most memorable being the cricket match and musical show at Fateh Maidan (LB stadium) in 1963 to raise money for India Defence Fund soon after the India-China war in October-November 1962. An amount of Rs 1.60 lakh — Rs 93 crore at current prices if the value of gold then is taken into account — was collected from the event and donated to the Defence Fund. Two other memorable occasions in Hyderabad were his shoot for the film, Kanoon Apna Apna, at Qutub Shahi tombs in 1987, and his visit in early 1950s to the residence of Maharaja Kishen Pershad, prime minister of princely Hyderabad state. His last visit to the city was in 1996. Though Dilip Kumar had also visited Hyderabad in 1981 to participate in a match, the legendary actor wrote in his autobiography that he would like to forget it as it pertained to his secret marriage with a Hyderabadi girl. Recalling the shooting of Kanoon Apna Apna, MA Qayyum, former deputy director, state archaeology, told TOI that taking his time off the film shooting Dilip Kumar wanted to explore the Qutub Shahi tombs. “I took him to the tomb of Sultan Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah, founder of Hyderabad. From there Dilip Saheb saw Charminar. He wondered why the tombs are not under control of Archaeological Survey of India. I explained to him that the Nizam VII had wanted the tombs to be managed by the state archaeology,” he said. Apart from Dilip Kumar, Sanjay Dutt and Madhuri Dixit also starred in Kanoon Apna Apna, which was released in 1989. “Dilip Saheb was a perfectionist. Though the film director was satisfied with the shoot, Dilip Saheb was not happy. He wanted it to be shot again,” Qayyum said. The film crew carried 12 pairs of dress for Dilip Saheb so that he could choose from them for the shoot. T Sreekanth, author, said the grand stage show was organised in the city on February 17, 1963 to financially support the Indian army. Film actor Jairaj and Snehlata Bhoopal Reddy had organised the event in which apart from Dilip Kumar, 74 film personalities participated. Intach city convener P Anuradha Reddy said the entire Fateh Maidan ground was decorated resembling a filmi set. “With the help of my mother Snehlata, I sold the tickets. Thousands of people had gathered at the stadium and outside,” she recalled. Three aircraft were chartered and Indian Airlines ferried them free. Apart from his filmi association with Hyderabad, Dilip Kumar had also married a city girl named Asma Rahman in 1981 after they met at a match. The relationship lasted two years and they separated in 1983. Dilip Kumar had mentioned the episode in his autobiography in 2014 but said he would like to forget it. “The Bombay film industry decided to do a show in Hyderabad to raise funds for India Defence. Snehlata went to Bombay and... charted out the plan and executed the show,” Sreekanth, who authored a book on the life and times of Jairaj, legendary Bollywood actor from Telangana, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/from-the-cricket-pitch-to-the-filmi-sets-hyd-remembers-dilip-kumar/articleshow/84218710.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Dehradun||Remembering Dilip Kumar's connection with Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand, especially Nainital, has a connection with the Bollywood journey of ‘tragedy king’ Dilip Kumar, who died after repeated illnesses on Wednesday morning in Mumbai. “Madhumati”, the 1958 Bimal Roy film which won several Filmfare awards and was a landmark work in Kumar’s career, was partly shot in Nainital. Roy stayed in the lake town for six weeks, shooting songs for ‘Madhumati’ which co-starred Vyjayanthimala. “He had made a special demand that ‘Madhumati’ be shot in Nainital,” Doon-based film historian RK Verma told TOI. “He had visited Dehradun on a few occasions and loved eating bhutta (corn) here. I personally got to meet him several times because I was associated with the film industry and was a member of the Indian Motion Picture Producers’ Association (IMPPA) in 1976.” Dehradun-based collector Sheikh Amir Ahmed said, “Like millions of Indians, I was a big fan of Dilip saab. I have a passion for collecting memorabilia and requested him to sign a book in my collection. I contacted his manager and thanks to help from his wife Saira Banu ji, was able to get my copy of “Dilip Kumar, The Last Emperor”, signed by him. Later, I was able to get a signed copy of his autobiography as well.” Kumar, born Yusuf Khan in 1992 in Peshawar in pre-partition India, was buried at the Juhu Qabrastan in Mumbai on Wednesday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tragedy-king-dilip-kumars-uttarakhand-connect/articleshow/84214459.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Chandigarh||Captain Amarinder Singh meets Prashant Kishor amid Congress planning for Punjab polls||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh interacted with political strategist Prashant Kishor in Delhi on Wednesday morning, before the former returned to Chandigarh. It came a day after the CM’s meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi to finalise a roadmap for the 2022 assembly elections. Sources said Kishor met the chief minister for over half an hour at Kapurthala House. When contacted, Kishor’s team said it was a courtesy call and not to discuss any strategy for Congress in the state. Nevertheless, the meeting fuelled speculation of Amarinder getting an indication from Sonia that he would lead the party into the next elections. The ruling party hopes to aggressively take on the rivals as the AICC hopes to finalise a revamp of the state unit in coming days.  Kishor had successfully stitched together Amarinder’s 2017 election campaign and the latter has been keen on roping him in for a repeat performance. However, after his decision to quit the vocation of poll strategising following the West Bengal elections, Kishor has not clarified on his Punjab plan as yet. He was earlier appointed the principal adviser to the CM and had held preliminary meetings with officials on pending poll promises. “The last one month has witnessed hectic political parleys, both in Chandigarh and Delhi, and Amarinder has tried to win over the confidence of MLAs lately being seen to be his detractors. He would want Kishor by his side as Akalis and AAP are slowly getting into poll mode,” said a Congress leader. Meanwhile, there have been reports that Kishor’s team had been conducting surveys to gauge the party’s prospects for a while. The verified social media pages launched during the last elections too have become active over the last few weeks. The AICC panel headed by Rajya Sabha MP Mallikarjun Kharge has already asked Amarinder to make announcements on 18 points, including key pending promises, to brighten the party’s poll prospects and also address the grouses of disgruntled MLAs. At the same time, where a section of Congress MLAs is wary of Kishor having a say in ticket distribution, there is speculation that the party might go in for a faceless campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/captain-meets-kishor-amid-cong-planning-for-pb-polls/articleshow/84217047.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||Hyderabad||Will adopt central law to rein in errant private hospitals: Director of public health to Telangana HC||HYDERABAD: Responding over the state’s claims to rein in private hospitals from fleecing patients, state director of public health (DPH) Dr G Srinivas Rao on Wednesday conceded before the high court that the existing law on private hospitals did not have enough teeth to deal with errant players. “The current law, the Telangana Allopathic Private Medical Care Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2002, does not allow us to impose penalties beyond Rs 20,000 on any errant private medical care facility,” he said, responding to a query from a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, on capping charges at private hospitals. The bench, while resuming the hearing in Covid-19 batch cases, sought to know from the state the status of its assurance on reining in private hospitals, whose notoriety for exploitation of people knew no bounds during the second wave of Covid-19. The director of public health, who logged into the virtual court, however, assured the court that they would improve the situation by adopting the central law on clinical establishments that gives them more powers to penalise private hospitals. “If that comes in, we will also start imposing prohibitively high penalties that are equivalent to ten to twenty times of the excess charges they collected from the crisis-struck patients and their families. We studied the Kerala model and we will also implement the same stringent regime after bringing in the central law,” he said. “The current Act is stopping me from imposing penalties beyond Rs 20,000,” he said. He also informed the court about the formation of an expert committee to advise the state on capping charges. The director also gave replies to several questions posed by the bench on vaccinating various sections of people, providing mental health support, among others. The court also inquired about the earlier promise of strengthening the state health facilities by recruiting 35,000 doctors and health staff. The bench advised the state to regularise those who are working in class four jobs in the health sector.Dr G Srinivas Rao informed the court that the state was thinking on similar lines and that he would inform the court about the state action in his next affidavit. The case was adjourned to August 11 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/will-adopt-central-law-to-rein-in-errant-pvt-hosps-dph-to-court/articleshow/84218946.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: ‘Need more Covid care centres in case of third wave’||HYDERABAD: Not just prevention; but early detection and treatment too will play a key role in arresting the spread of Covid-19, in case there is a third wave, highlights a report prepared by the Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) along with Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) Telangana state council. Titled ‘Covid-19 recommendations for India’, the report stresses the need for home care, large-scale Covid-19 care centres, especially in rural areas, to tackle the virus. “The Indian variant is very virulent and is expected to infect majority of population according to some studies and is now very active in rural India. Hence prevention focus is not enough. Early detection – with extensive testing and fast and accurate results – and shifting of patient to Covid-19 centres is the only way to prevent the entire family,” reads the report based on the current Covid-19 situation in India.. The joint report further suggests increasing incentives to frontline health workers and better bed management apart from encouraging home and secondary Covid-19 care. The idea, it adds, is to prevent direct hospitalisations. “Frontline health workers should be incentivised (both financial and non-financial) to motivate them. Incentives like advance salary, additional salary, Covid-19 treatment facilities etc should be considered,” reads the report recommending the creation of large number of secondary care centres in each district under private management, tertiary care, streamlining of bed management among others. “The second wave of Covid-19 has been experienced in all major states and union territories...There was a shortage of oxygen, beds and essential drugs. The Niti Aayog has predicted a third wave even if second wave tapers off in the next few weeks. In this context, this study is an attempt to provide actionable recommendations for tiding over Covid-19 and provide best practices which will be helpful for our country,” said Dr Subodh Kandamuthan, director for ASCI’s Centre for Health Care Management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/need-more-covid-care-centres-in-case-of-3rd-wave/articleshow/84219044.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Two cement cos fined for PM limit breach in Tandur||Hyderabad: The Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) has asked two top cement companies, including Penna Cements, to pay an environmental compensation for exceeding patriculate matter (PM) limits. The TSPCB’s report filed with the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) southern bench revealed how particulate matter (PM) pollution is affecting Tandur municipality. A petition in this regard was filed by Tandur Citizens’ Welfare Society with the NGT. Following this, on June 1, Cement Corporation of India, India Cements, and Penna Cement Industries had installed online stack monitoring and ambient air quality monitoring systems. The systems were connected with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and TSPCB websites. Cement Corporation of India had exceeded PM limit eight times since November 2019. The PCB committee had recommended levying environment compensation on the industry and imposed compensation charges of Rs 2.4 lakh which has been paid the company. Meanwhile, Penna Cements exceeded PM limit eight times and was levied environmental compensation of Rs 3.3 lakh. It too has paid the amount while India Cements was found not to have exceeded PM limits and hence was not fined. The pollution board had conducted ambient air quality monitoring in Tandur town at three locations — terrace of police station, terrace of Satya Sai Temple (near Tandur railway station), and near the office room of HP petrol bunk — to ascertain the ambient air quality in Tandur. The particulate matter was found to be beyond permissible limits. Board officials inspected Tandur railway station and discussed the issue of loading and unloading of materials from cement industries. The station master at Tandur railway station informed that they had stopped loading and unloading since 2017. The Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) has informed that they have acquired 212 acres of land at Novalga village in Tandur mandal under Vikarabad district, and are developing an industrial park for stone cutting and polishing units. This, as the state revenue department informed that as soon as the industrial park is opened, the shifting of stone cutting and polishing units shall be taken up. The TSIIC informed that the scheduled time for the completion of the industrial park is February 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-cement-cos-fined-for-pm-limit-breach-in-tandur/articleshow/84218819.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Vijaysen Reddy has been monitoring cases filed in relation to the formation of this authority-cum-tribunal. As a result of the constant goading by court, the matter has now reached its final stages. The high court bench was dealing with a batch of public interest litigations (PILs) filed by the Front Line Environment Safeguard Society and others, along with several writ petitions filed for the purpose. The bench noted that, in the past, the absence of such an authority has resulted in more appeals against the pollution control board coming directly before the high court. The bench refused to give the state the four weeks time as had been sought by the state counsel and gave just one week instead while also directing him to bring the gazette notification on the constitution of the tribunal. According to the cousel for Front Line Society, VT Kalyan, the bench gave the state one last opportunity to form the appellate with immediate effect. The case was adjourned to July 14.

---||Vadodara||Trickle of cases, but source of infections a mystery||Vadodara: A lactating mother staying in the eastern part of the city tested positive for Covid-19 this week. It came to light that she had not left her house for the last six months and none of her close contacts were positive  The case of this mother is not an isolated one, and in most Covid-19 cases reported over a period of time, it seems that its one off. No close contacts or persons at places where the person has spent time in the recent past are found positive.  Obtaining extensive details of individual cases has become possible again as the number of new cases reported every day is now in single digits. It is also possible to conduct tests or keep track of the health of those staying with the infected person. Hardly any case of even those staying with the infected persons are coming to light. “It is becoming difficult to identify from where the person is getting the infection. This was expected when there were a large number of cases in the city as the caseload was very high. At that stage, people could have been infected anywhere. But that is not the case anymore and still we do not know where the person got infected,” said a VMC health department official. Dr V S Mazumdar, former professor and head of the department of community medicine at the Baroda Medical College, said that such infections were possible due to asymptomatic cases in the community who may be infecting others. “Another possibility is that of some variant infecting the person who tested positive,” he said. Dr Mazumdar added that there were many who were ignoring mild cough or cold, but could still be infected. He pointed out that there were also chances that the disease may be becoming endemic. He, however, added that as no sero surveys had been done in the city it was difficult to reach conclusions. Doctors have been observing that data from sero surveys as well as genome sequencing was crucial, but not available for the city.  VMC’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that multiple reasons could be responsible for the way the disease was behaving. “The environment or the agent causing the disease can both affect transmission. Studies also indicate at pollen may have a role in transmitting Covid-19. This is not the pollination season and if the study is an indication transmission may remain low,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/trickle-of-cases-but-source-of-infections-a-mystery/articleshow/84214246.cms||Sachin Sharma

She alleged that her late husband’s property was being sold by Swami Kailashanand Giri who is presently acharya mahamandaleshwar of Niranjani akhada and was earlier in Agni akhada. She also alleged that the property belonged to Swami Rasanand who had married her and the couple has a son who is the "legitimate heir". Three days ago, Kaur held a press conference in Haridwar and alleged that Swami Kailashnand Giri has no right and valid documents. With the help of local property dealers it is being sold away, she said. Kaur told TOI, “The property is being sold after the death of Swami Rasanand. Despite several complaints the administration is not taking any action.” Swami Kailashanand Giri's office is unavailable for comment.

After the infection surfaced, samples of more than two dozen people were collected from the Kaalinagar area of Udham Singh Nagar. As a precautionary measure, containment and micro-containment zones have been created in the district based on the movement of the infected person. The infection surfaced after some samples were sent to the central laboratory in Delhi for genome sequencing. The health authorities have confirmed that the infected person, a BTech student, had come to Dineshpur (Udham Singh Nagar) to meet his relatives from Lucknow on April 29. Later, on May 20, he complained of fever and on May 24, his Covid-19 test report returned positive. Subsequently, he was kept in home isolation. On June 9, he went back to Lucknow. At present, the infected student is staying with his parents in the residential premises of Lucknow's Balrampur Hospital, where his mother is a nurse. Dr Avinash Khanna, additional chief medical officer of Udham Singh Nagar, said, “The infected person went to a couple of areas in the district to meet his relatives. Thus, we have converted those areas into containment zones. The locality of his grandparent's house, where he stayed during the visit, has been turned into a micro containment zone.” Meanwhile, Uttarakhand recorded 77 fresh Covid-19 infections on Wednesday. However, the state didn’t record any fatality on the day, for the first time in nearly a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/lucknow-student-who-visited-his-grandparents-in-us-nagar-diagnosed-with-delta-plus-variant-of-covid-uttarakhand-health-dept-on-alert/articleshow/84214559.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Agra||Former sub-inspector and Agra MP SP Singh Baghel gets ministerial berth||AGRA: A sub-inspector in UP police, a professor of military science and a five-time member of parliament, Satya Pal Singh Baghel has donned many hats in his career, but the 61-year-old’s “biggest achievement” came on Wednesday as he was inducted into the Union council of ministers. “I’m thankful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for providing me the opportunity to serve the people of the country in a better way. This is the happiest moment of my life and my biggest achievement yet. I will not leave any stone unturned in doing justice to the portfolio assigned to me,” the BJP MP from Agra told TOI. He has been given minister of state (law and justice). Baghel, who hails from Auraiya district, is known for his oratory as much as he is known for his party hopping. He was a member of the Lok Sabha in 1998, 1999 and 2004 as a Samajwadi Party MP and represented the Jalesar seat. In 2009, Baghel joined Bahujan Samaj Party and was elected to the Rajya Sabha as a BSP nominee.Baghel, who hails from Auraiya district, is known for his oratory as much as he is known for his party hopping. He was a member of the Lok Sabha in 1998, 1999 and 2004 as a Samajwadi Party MP and represented the Jalesar seat. In 2009, Baghel joined Bahujan Samaj Party and was elected to the Rajya Sabha as a BSP nominee. But in 2014, Baghel resigned as BSP Rajya Sabha MP after contesting and losing Lok Sabha elections from Firozabad. Soon after, he aligned himself with the BJP. In 2015, he was appointed the president of BJP OBC Morcha. In 2017, he won the assembly elections from Tundla seat and served as a minister (animal husbandry) in Yogi Adityanath’s cabinet. In 2019, he was fielded by the BJP from the Agra Lok Sabha seat (SC) — replacing the incumbent Ram Shankar Katheria, the then chief of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes. Baghel managed to notch a major victory, defeating the BSP candidate Manoj Kumar Soni by over two lakh votes. Back in the 90s, however, the local intelligence unit (LIU) sleuth had few political aspirations. He had joined UP Police as sub-inspector soon after completing his MSc. It was only when he was serving as a security officer to former chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav that his political ambitions started taking shape. He took voluntary retirement from police in 1993 and was appointed the state president of Samajwadi Party’s youth brigade. A PhD in military science, Baghel is also a professor at Agra College. Baghel’s political career, however, hasn’t remained free of controversy. A case is pending in court against him after it was alleged that he had contested elections on a forged caste certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/former-sub-inspector-and-agra-mp-sp-singh-baghel-gets-ministerial-berth/articleshow/84214562.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Delhi||NGT asks panel to fix rainwater harvesting gaps in city||New Delhi: National Green Tribunal has ordered a joint committee of Delhi Jal Board, Central Pollution Control Board and Delhi Pollution Control Board to look into the rainwater harvesting systems in Delhi. An applicant in the tribunal claimed that he surveyed rainwater systems in 40 societies of Dwarka and found deficiencies. “The borewells are deeper, enabling polluted water to mix with the groundwater. This requires joint inspection of rainwater systems in all areas of Delhi to ensure proper functional design, level at which the borewell should be installed, use of gravel, coarse, sand in filter media. DPCC has issued notice to seal the borewells of all the societies and to impose penalty which is not justified. On surface areas of the societies, the water is wasted which should be taken to the water bodies,” said the plea. “A joint committee of DJB, CPCB and DPCC may look into the matter and take remedial action in the matter in accordance with law. The committee may inter-alia ascertain the technical efficacy of installed systems and changes, if any, required and the issue of contamination of ground water,” said the bench. It also directed officials to submit an action taken report in two months. While hearing another matter, NGT had earlier observed that “the central monitoring committee may explore whether a model can be developed as a strategy for augmenting supply of drinking water by linking water collected through rainwater harvesting systems to the water supply systems on the pattern of schemes for connecting solar energy generated in individual houses with the grids with requisite incentives to motivate the concerned individuals/organisations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ngt-asks-panel-to-fix-rainwater-harvesting-gaps-in-city/articleshow/84251907.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Seven-member panels to take call on opening schools in Maharashtra villages||MUMBAI: Two days after staying its government resolution on reopening of schools, the state on Wednesday issued fresh orders for bringing back students of classes VIII to XII to schools in rural areas where no Covid-19 cases have been reported in the past one month. Every Covid-free village will have a seven-member committee, comprising the sarpanch, the talati (revenue officer), the health officer, a village level worker, a school management representative, a teacher and the school head. The committee will take the final decision on reopening a school. Teachers will have to be vaccinated on a priority basis. The committee will have to coordinate with district officers to get teachers vaccinated. An RT-PCR negative test will also be mandatory for teachers. School timing should not exceed three to four hours and there will be no lunch break (recess) for students. Several dos and don’ts, including following Covid protocols, have been laid down for schools. In case a student gets Covid, the school will have to be shut down. While parents’ consent will be mandatory, they will not be allowed to enter schools. Education officers have been asked to conduct a “back-to-school” campaign in villages. The standard operating procedure detailed in Monday’s GR, including one student per bench, six feet distance between two benches and 15-20 children per class, remains the same. The actual reopening of schools will take two to three weeks, said a state official. Students in rural areas have faced learning losses last year during online education. Internet connectivity has been the prime reason. The state wants to reopen classes V to VII in the second phase. Schools in urban areas are unlikely to reopen for physical teachings before September. State officials said online learning this year has been better streamlined in city schools as compared to the previous year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-7-member-panels-to-take-call-on-opening-schools-in-villages/articleshow/84217085.cms||Sandhya Nair

In a fresh thread of six tweets, Sidhu reiterated his Punjab model for the state’s development. “Politics without work on policy is merely negative campaigning and politicians without a pro-people agenda are here just for business. Thus, politics without development has no meaning to me. Today, I emphasize again that we need a Punjab model for the development of Punjab.” “Won’t blame (former CM Parskash Singh and son Sukhbir Singh) Badals for having no vision because I know they don’t. Today, solar energy is Rs 1.99 per unit, with other benefits i.e. renewable, available onsite (solar tube-well) etc. But Badal-signed faulty PPAs have tied Punjab to thermal power paying much higher for decades,” he added. “No Delhi model! Delhi does not generate its own power, and distribution is in the hands of Reliance and TATA. Punjab generates 25% of its own power and distributes through state-owned corporation, providing employment to thousands. Delhi model means bigger private players than Badals,” he tweeted. “Punjab gives 10% of its budget (Rs 10,668 crore) as power subsidy, but Delhi gives 4% of its budget (Rs 3,080 crore). Apart from agriculture, Punjab gives 200 units completely free to 15 lakh families (SC, BC & BPL), but Delhi charges 50% for less than 400 units and complete bill for all above 400 units,” he said. “Now, the big question: can the minister for power, new and renewable energy, Punjab, do any of this? Not even 1%. All decision-making powers are with PSERC directly reporting to the CM. Thus, I invested my time in the Punjab model to chart the path to return people’s power back to the people ,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/state-doesnt-need-delhi-model-tweets-sidhu/articleshow/84217099.cms||---

Speaking to TOI, a protesting intern from Srinagar Medical College, said, “Our protest was an attempt to convey the message that we can earn more money by sweeping rather than working as medical interns in Uttarakhand.” The medico added that seven interns of the Srinagar Medical College were also deployed on Covid-19 duty and yet the medical trainees are not getting their dues. Similarly, the interns of the Government Doon Medical College and Hospital also staged a protest after the OPD hours of the medical facility.  The interns have been demanding that their stipend be raised from Rs 7,500 per month to Rs 23,500 per month. They claim that the authorities of medical colleges are not supporting their protests. Two of the state medical colleges have even issued show-cause notices to some of the students for staging protests. Meanwhile, the state government has cited lack of funds as the reason behind not hiking the pay of the medical interns. Incidentally, the high court, on Wednesday, directed the health secretary Amit Negi to look into the matter and increase the stipend of the students, if feasible. The stipend of MBBS interns in the hill state was fixed at Rs 250 per day in 2011 and there hasn’t been any revision in the past 10 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/med-interns-in-pauri-sweep-roads-to-protest-low-stipend/articleshow/84214642.cms||Shivani Azad

CM Uddhav Thackeray chaired two meetings, speaking to district collectors as well as task force members regarding preparedness for the third wave and possible steps to bring down cases in Kolhapur, Pune rural, Sangli, Satara, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Raigad and Palghar. “We need better contact tracing, tighter curbs and containment policies in these districts,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the Covid task force. “Although these areas have special vaccination drives, cases are not dropping.” The state reported 9,558 cases and 147 deaths, taking the total caseload to 61.2 lakh and, with the addition of 179 old deaths, the toll to 1,23,857. Regarding Mumbai, where cases (662) rose after two days of being under 500, Joshi said the “thick tail” is a worry. “The second wave continues actively in the state, including Mumbai. Failure to adhere to Covid-appropriate norms could see a spike in cases in the second wave itself,” he added. Nine deaths were registered in Mumbai on Wednesday, the lowest in 16 days. Thackeray said though the second wave has not completely ebbed, the state has taken a calculated risk in opening up businesses and districts should ensure restrictions are implemented to stop a surge in cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cases-up-in-city-state-govt-focus-on-8-dists-of-concern/articleshow/84217129.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Uttar Pradesh Board class X & XII English syllabus revised based on NCERT pattern||PRAYAGRAJ: Students of class XII of UP Board will no longer get to study the works of Nobel prize-winning litterateur Rabindranath Tagore and that of former President of India, Dr S Radhakrishnan in English subject from this academic session. Reason being that the Uttar Pradesh Madhyamik Shiksha Parishad (UPMSP), has implemented the NCERT syllabus for English in classes X and XII from this year. Because of the implementation of the new syllabus, a story like ‘The Home Coming’, penned by Rabindranath Tagore and the essay 'Women’s Education' by S Radhakrishnan, are no longer part of the course curriculum. Besides, AL Basham’s ‘The Heritage of India’ has also been removed. On the same lines, works of renowned poets like John Milton and PB Shelley will also be excluded from the English textbook and so would be the story titled, An Astrologer’s Day’, written by RK Narayanan and ‘The Lost Child’ by Mulk Raj Anand. A poem penned by the 'Nightingale of India' Sarojini Naidu, titled ‘The Village Song’, which was part of the syllabus in class X and works of C Rajagopalachari, WM Raeburn and R Srinivasan have failed to find a place in class X course. Though UP Board officials are reluctant to comment on the change as it is yet to be put up on UP Board’s official website, senior officials confirmed these changes citing an approval received from the state government. “Within the next few days itself, the new curriculum would become online,” said one of these senior officials. Sources informed that now that the NCERT syllabus would be implemented, the students would need to study a lesser number of books. Earlier, there were four books besides grammar course in class XII whereas now there would be just two books, ‘Flamingo’ and ‘Vistas’ in English. Similarly, in class X, there would be two books with the name ‘First Flight’ and ‘Footprints Without Feet'. As per the new syllabus, students in class XII would study works of Anees Jung, William Douglas and Louis Fischer. In poetry, the students will study poems by famous poets like Kamala Das, Pablo Neruda and John Keats. In class X, the students will study works by the anti-apartheid revolutionary and former President of Africa, Nelson Mandela, author N Frank and Russian writer Anton Chekhov. Works of famous poets like Robert Frost, Walt Whitman and William Butler Yeats will also be a part of the poetry syllabus. UP Board in the past three years has introduced NCERT-syllabus based books for 26 subjects in high school and intermediate. It had introduced 31 books of 18 different subjects based on the NCERT syllabus for students of class IX to class XII from the academic session 2018-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/up-board-class-x-xii-english-syllabus-revised-based-on-ncert-pattern/articleshow/84214644.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Akali Dal leaders stay away from ex-DGP Alam’s funeral||Jalandhar: No senior SAD leader attended the funeral of former DGP (prisons) Izhar Alam, who remained the party’s vice-president and his wife was party MLA and chief parliamentary secretary during the Badal regime from 2012 to 2017, at Sirhind on Wednesday. No senior party leader even tweeted to express grief. There was no tweet from SAD’s official twitter handle also. In fact, party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, former Union minister Harsimrat Badal and party general secretary Bikram Singh Majithia tweeted to pay tributes to legendary actor Dilip Kumar, but none on Alam. This public distancing after Alam’s death is in complete contrast to the approach of Akali Dal’s top brass when in power. Then, they had not only defended Alam but also promoted him politically. While his was wife Farzana Alam became MLA from Malerkotla in 2012, Alam was appointed chairman of Punjab Waqf Board. His wife was SAD candidate again in 2017 from Malerkotla, but she lost the election. In October last year, she was appointed general secretary of Istri Akali Dal. However, her name was later dropped, after facing flak from party leader Kiranjot Kaur, who was also appointed general secretary, and scores of Sikh netizens. The contrast in SAD’s approach reflects the paradox it faces while trying to recover lost base among Sikhs and the common refrain about the former top cop in the community was of dislike for his alleged role in serious human rights violations during militancy days. He was accused of creating Alam Sena — a personal paramilitary force — even in a US Embassy cable of December 19, 2005. In September 2011, this cable came in public domain through WikiLeaks and a few weeks later his political career thrived in SAD. In October 2011, SAD (Badal) had roped in Alam and projected him as candidate from Malerkotola by appointing him as constituency in-charge. Notwithstanding SAD ally Damdami Taksal’s serious allegations against him regarding involvement in eliminating several innocent Sikh youths during militancy period, then Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal had given Alam a clean chit during a media interaction in October 2011. “I am not aware of anything against Alam. I have never heard anything against Alam, that he was involved in killing of any innocents and nobody has ever told me anything like this about him. Show me any evidence against him,” he had said. However, later he adopted an ambiguous approach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/akali-dal-leaders-stay-away-from-ex-dgp-alams-funeral/articleshow/84217316.cms||IP Singh
---||Delhi||Revenge travel eases hoteliers’ worries ahead of impending third wave of Covid-19||NEW DELHI: Revenge travel is the term being used to describe the huge rush of tourists to destinations near Delhi. Images of overcrowded roads and tourist spots are being widely shared, worrying the government because of the implications for the spread of Covid-19 infection, especially with the revellers paying no heed to Covid-appropriate behaviour. This has, however, breathed a fresh lease of life into the beleaguered hospitality sector. Indeed, a study by credit card platform CRED has recorded a rise in card spends on travel and leisure after the easing of the lockdown. Once faced with the closure of hotels, today even homes in Uttarakhand are being turned into homestays to cater to this revenge travel rush, said a hotelier. Along with big hotel chains, boutique hotels and smaller groups are relieved at the arrival of the tourists. “This is good news for all hotels in the hills,” enthused Vinit Chhabra, GM, The Khyber Himalayan Resort & Spa, Gulmarg. In a similar vein, Danish Din, director, The Grand Dragon Ladakh, added, “Having seen a bleak season last year, this is definitely a welcome sign.” Din hoped the ‘dream run’ for establishments like his continued and guests behaved responsibly. Sudeep Jain, managing director, South West Asia, IHG Hotels & Resorts, too noted ‘a significant increase’ in enquiries and bookings, especially for weekend staycations and quick getaways. “Most of our hotels, especially in the metro cities, have recorded an average weekend occupancy of over 50%, while some even crossed 80% occupancy recently,” he claimed. Its own survey found that a significant section of Indians expressed keen interest in travelling in 2021, said Daniel D’Souza, president and country head, Leisure, SOTC Travel. “Our Third Holiday Readiness Report (June 2021) reveals that over 69% of Indians are keen to travel in 2021,” he said. Destinations that received most enquiries were Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh, Kashmir, Dubai, Maldives, Russia and Switzerland. Led by strong pent-up demand, Airbnb too has seen overall gross bookings in India in the first quarter of 2021 surpass the 2019 levels. Simran Kodesia, communications lead, India and Southeast Asia, said a survey conducted by Airbnb-YouGov indicated a high interest in domestic and nearby travel. “66% of Indians are considering trips that are within driving distance from key metros. This is backed by the resurgence in demand for destinations such as Lonavla, Shimla, Manali, Pune, Kasauli, Mussoorie, Nainital and Dharamshala,” Kodesia elaborated. Pratik Mazumder, CMO, Mahindra Holidays asserted that revenge travel was what was driving the travel industry at the moment and expected the momentum to increase as the vaccination drive makes progress. He noted that not only smaller hotels, but even five-star chains were seeing a surge. Likewise, Benita Sharma, area manager North, ITC Hotels, and GM, ITC Maurya, observed that safe staycations and responsible dining had gained traction among people. “There has been a sharp increase in weekend occupancy at ITC Maurya, with guests very excited to stay safely within the comfort of their own city. The drivecation has also gained ground and our hotels in the golden triangle — ITC Grand Bharat in Manesar, ITC Mughal in Agra and ITC Rajputana in Jaipur — have become the preferred choice of travellers,” claimed Sharma. Domestic travel has come as a big boost to boutique hotels.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 1.81 lakh apply for 73,000 RTE seats||AHMEDABAD: More than 1.81 lakh applications have been received under the Right To Education (RTE) Act for admission to Class 1. This is about 2.5 times more than the total number of 73,499 seats that are expected to be reserved for RTE students for 2021-22, said sources in the education department. The first list of students who have been successfully admitted to schools will be released on July 15 after the form verification process on July 10, said sources. As per the act, 25% of total school admissions in Class 1 should be reserved under RTE for underprivileged students. The department began the admission process for students under the RTE Act on June 25 and the last day for application was July 6. The entire process is being held online. The schools have already started the new academic year from June 7 and the RTE students who are enrolled this year are likely to fall behind in classes by one-and-a-half to two months. As many as 40,530 seats in Gujarat meant for candidates under the provisions of the RTE Act were not given to such students in past two years. This was stated in a data tabled by the government in the state assembly earlier this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/1-81l-apply-for-73k-rte-seats/articleshow/84188181.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand HC issues notice to state over registration of Sikh marriages||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday issued a notice to the state government while hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) which revealed that even nine years after the amendment from the Parliament, the hill state is yet to notify rules for the registration of Sikh marriages, also known as Anand Karaj. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma has given the state four weeks to respond to the petition. According to petitioner, Amanjot Singh Chadha, a practicing advocate at the HC, the origins of Anand Karaj go back to early Sikhism. “The Imperial Legislative Council – a legislature of British India – had passed the Anand Marriage Act in 1909 to give legal sanction to the wedding ceremony common among Sikhs and to remove the doubts which may be cast on their validity. The Indian Parliament, in June 2012, made amendments to the Act and mandated the states to formulate rules for the registration of Sikh marriages,” he said. While several states like Kerala, Delhi and Chhattisgarh have notified these rules, Uttarakhand is yet to issue a notification in this regard. “The right to practice one's religion and maintain one's religious identity is granted to every citizen under Article 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India. Weddings are connected with the identity of a community and the non-implementation of any mechanism for registration of these nuptial ceremonies impairs those rights,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-issues-notice-to-state-over-registration-of-sikh-marriages/articleshow/84214689.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Ludhiana||Industrialists: Need flexibility, not closure of units to rationalise power in Punjab||PATIALA: Industrialists in Mandi Gobindgarh town of Fatehgarh Sahib district on Wednesday held a meeting and decided to give a memorandum to the state government demanding flexibility in allowing them to use power up to 50% instead of closing the industry to meet the power demand. Late on Monday evening, Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) extended the power restrictions and asked the large-scale industries in Punjab using more than 100 KW of load in central, north, and west zones to shut down for another three days till July 10 as the state is facing power shortage. The continuous supply industry has also been asked to use just 50% of the sanctioned load from July 8 to July 18. This is necessary to maintain 8-hour supply to the agriculture sector. “There are around 350 industrial units in Fatehgarh Sahib using more than 100 KW load and the shut down will lead to huge losses. Several input costs, including labour cost, cannot be curtailed. We decided in the meeting to request the government to allow industry to operate on 50% power usage and the government can keep this restriction till the state is facing power shortage. We are ready to cooperate, but shutting down completely will leave a bad impact on the industry,” industrialists said. The power shortage has continued to hit the state amid rising demand and low in-house generation. On Wednesday, even the third unit of Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL) thermal plant operated at half the load at around 335 MW. The loss of about 300 MW is a setback for PSPCL. Two units of 1980 MW thermal plant are already facing shut down while one unit had been lying shut since March this year, the other unit tripped on Saturday evening. On Tuesday, the maximum power demand was 12,969 MW. There was a shortage of 775 MW during evening peak hours leading to imposition of power cuts on rural and small-town domestic consumers. The PSPCL supplied 3,006 lakh units of power and 944 lakh units were supplied by thermal units. The gross generation stands reduced to 5,031MW in the afternoon. The power supply from thermal units is 1,600 MW and 800MW from hydro units. The generation from private generators stands reduced at 2,175MW. On Monday too, the maximum power demand was 13,289 MW with a shortage of 450 MW and the maximum demand met was 12,839 MW. The TSPL spokesperson said the second unit which faced technical problem on Saturday evening is likely to be operational again late by Wednesday. In the past few weeks, the farmers had gheraoed the PSPCL employees at power grids across the state during the paddy season. Besides, the domestic sector has been witnessing scheduled and unscheduled power cuts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/industrialists-need-flexibility-not-closure-of-units-to-rationalise-power/articleshow/84217123.cms||Bharat Khanna

Following a TOI story published on July 7 of Narendar Babu and his brother Srinivas grinding it out in their agriculture field substituting for their bullocks which died recently, several readers from different parts of the country opened their hearts and purses offering to help the family. As the two bullocks of the family had died in an accident and the family had not money to buy another pair, Sammaih’s sons Narendar Babu—who had done BSc and BEd—and his younger brother Srinivas—a post-graduate in social work—ploughed the field, taking the yoke upon themselves. The family had no money, as for the last two years the brothers were without work due to the pandemic. Several people, including individuals, corporates, NGOs and students, expressed their wish to extend help to the family. An official of Canara Bank told TOI from Bengaluru that they had also reached out to the family as they were account holders in the local branch. “Our staff met the family on Wednesday afternoon and handed over a letter to them that they could avail loan for buying a pair of bullocks,” the official said. A team of Canara Bank officials from Warangal went to Domeda village and met the family. On Wednesday, some persons willing to help the family spoke to them to find out more details. In this backdrop, Narendar Babu, one of the brothers informed bank officials that they would avail the loan to buy the bullocks as they were hoping that those who reached out to them would help them financially.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/peoples-kindness-to-help-brothers-buy-oxen/articleshow/84221231.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

During the event, held in partnership with Doon University and USAID (United States Agency for International Development) India, several academicians discussed the various aspects of children’s literature. The online workshop was inaugurated by Doon University’s vice-chancellor Surekha Dangwal. During her inaugural address, she put stress on collating regional culture and folklores into children’s literature. “I think a good literature will provide a quality discussion and dissemination of information among the children and also it is important to transmit the stories from one society to another through grandparents,” said Dangwal. During the event, Pushplata Rawat, state manager, Room to Read, highlighted the availability of children's literature in 42 languages globally. Sourav Banerjee, country director of Room to Read, said, “As an organisation, we would like to create further opportunities to introduce a course on children’s literature in collaboration with Doon University and other universities of the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/two-day-webinar-on-academic-study-of-childrens-literature-concludes/articleshow/84214729.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Teens raise funds, organise vax drive for micro-communities||MUMBAI: Watching their neighbourhood vegetable vendors and milkmen struggle to get access to vaccines prompted a bunch of teenage students to think how they could help. Within weeks, they managed to rustle up funds from affluent donors and approached a private hospital to procure doses for these micro-communities. Around 350 individuals, including egg vendors, barbers, newspapermen etc., have got inoculated so far through the youngsters’ efforts. “Micro-communities are most vulnerable to catching a Covid infection as their work takes them all over the city,” said Shiv Karnani, a student of Dhirubhai Ambani International School (DAIS) who formed a group called ‘TEAM’ with 18 others from top schools and colleges. As they started to approach vendors, the students discovered that some were fearful of taking shots. “We created short video clips in local languages and circulated them on WhatsApp to debunk myths. The videos convinced people that the vaccines were safe,” said Karnani. The students then got these individuals registered on the CoWin platform. The details of beneficiaries along with their Aadhaar numbers and phone numbers went into an Excel sheet. The next task was to organise funds for purchasing vaccines. The students approached well-off families living around them. “We realised that some of the beneficiaries wouldn’t have enough money to travel to the venue of the inoculation drive. So it was decided to collect Rs 1,000 for every beneficiary to not only cover the cost of the vaccine, but also transportation,” said Gayatri Sanghi, a student of Hill Spring International School. The students split into sub-groups and divided tasks. While one handled vaccine procurement, another was in-charge of logistics. “We had approached Jaslok Hospital for procurement of vaccines and did not want any of the doses to get wasted. Repeated reminders were sent to people to come and take their shot,” said Yash Fadia, a DAIS student. The inoculation drive was organised at a Bandra auditorium last month. The team also managed to reach out to 27 visually challenged people from underprivileged backgrounds who were vaccinated as part of the same drive. “Security guards are at maximum risk of getting infected as we come in contact with everything from e-commerce deliveries to elevator buttons. Every guard should be inoculated on priority,” said Manok Shilware, a watchman from Kalina, who was one of the beneficiaries. “We are privileged to have been a part of such a noble cause and urge everyone else to identify and help other underprivileged individuals around them..,” said a statement from Jaslok Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-teens-raise-funds-organise-vax-drive-for-micro-communities/articleshow/84217166.cms||Nitasha Natu

Begum Bazar police booked a criminal case against former Secunderabad MP Anjan Kumar Yadav, Revanth Reddy, Anil Yadav and others on the charge of 341(Punishment for wrongful restraint), 149 (Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 290 (Punishment for public nuisance ) and other relevant sections of IPC, violation of Disaster Management Act and City Police Act. The rally taken out by Congress leaders led to traffic disturbance at various parts of the city, including at Masab Tank, Mallepally, Nampally, Lakidikapul, different roads of Banjara Hills, and Jubilee Hills, to name a few. As a result, motorists faced severe difficulty and a large number of Congress leaders took out rallies to converge at Gandhi Bhavan. The Congress cadre who were part of the rally were spread up to a kilometer in length. It took nearly 45 minutes for motorists to reach from Jubilee Hills check post to Punjagutta. When the rally was moving on Road no 3 in Banjara Hills, Revanth was garlanded right in the middle of the road by his followers using a crane, which led to traffic jam for some time. Similar scenes were witnessed at in Masab Tank and surrounding areas. In fact, a few days ago Hyderabad police denied permission sought by Anjan Kumar Yadav for taking out a rally to reach Gandhi Bhavan. “Despite permission being denied, two different rallies were taken out. These rallies were taken out in routes not part of notified routes, where rallies can be taken only with permission. Many in the rally violated Covid-appropriate behaviuor,” an official of Hyderabad police said, on the condition of anonymity.

It is a fact that only Congress can defeat the TRS. The next 27 months are crucial for the new Telangana-team Congress to work hard to win 2023-polls,” he said. The threat of rain saw the speeches of the likes of Manickam Tagore, N Uttam Kumar Reddy and Bhatti Vikramarka be cut short. Speakers at the oath-taking ceremony stage of Revanth Reddy were urged to complete their speeches in a couple of minutes. Even Revanth Reddy cut short his speech as the skies opened up. He, however, termed it a good omen. “Even rain god is joining hands with the Congress’ new team to restore the glory of the party in Telangana,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/speeches-cut-short-by-good-omen-rain/articleshow/84221235.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Man in Pune presents masked impostor to acquire estranged wife’s properties||PUNE: A man allegedly acquired his estranged wife’s property — held individually and jointly — by presenting a woman wearing a face mask as his better half in the office of the joint sub-registrar, Haveli No. 9, in Dhankawdi. The Sahakarnagar police registered a case of cheating and forgery against the man, his lawyer and two others, including the impersonating woman, after his 37-year-old estranged wife lodged a complaint. The lawyer, Pradeep Jadhav (27), and his assistant, Saddam Sikandar Dhalait (26), were arrested on Tuesday night. Search is on for the man and the woman impersonator. “The lawyer arranged the woman, who posed as ‘wife’ of the main suspect in the sub-registrar’s office on June 23 to get the alleged fraudulent property transfer executed. A forged power of attorney in favour of the lawyer’s assistant and a deed gifting the properties to the husband were presented,” said senior inspector Swati Desai of the Sahakarnagar police. She said, “The woman individually owned a flat and a shop. She jointly owned another flat and a shop with her husband. Her husband runs other businesses. The couple got married 15 years ago and have two children. They have been residing at Ambegaon Pathar, where they have the properties, too. From June last year, the couple started quarrelling over domestic issues. A month later, the man served a divorce notice to his wife. While the divorce suit is going on, they have been living together in the interest of their children.” The senior inspector said, “The impersonating woman came to the sub-registrar’s office wearing a face mask, mandatory these days. The man introduced her as his ‘wife’ to the sub-registrar and other staff members. She removed the mask for a brief period when the office staffers took her photograph using a computer camera to process the property documents. Somehow, the authorities neglected the photograph pasted on the documents and the woman standing in front of the camera.” She said, “We shall record the statements of the officials at the sub-registrar’s office on how the documents, containing photographs of the aggrieved woman, were not verified while taking the photograph of the impersonating woman.” The authorities at the subregistrar’s office at Dhankawdi told TOI on Wednesday afternoon, “We are not allowed to speak with the media.” TOI also made several calls to the complainant’s husband in the evening, but his cellphone was switched off. Lawyer-activist Rupali Patil, helping the complainant, said, “The woman came to know about the gift deed and forgery in June. Her husband’s business is in a critical stage because of the pandemic. He either wanted to sell or rent out these properties. When he was dealing with these properties, his wife heard it and approached us. We took out all the documents and found that some other woman had posed as his wife at the sub-registrar’s office. The officials at the office informed us that the woman came wearing a mask. They did not take care to see the photograph of the woman on the documents, the identity cards attached to them and the woman standing in front of them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-presents-masked-impostor-to-acquire-estranged-wifes-properties/articleshow/84217266.cms||Gitesh Shelke

---||Chennai||BJP spars with ex-minister of AIADMK over poll defeat, minority votes||VILLUPURAM: On a day when several state BJP leaders slammed former AIADMK minister C Ve Shanmugam for his remarks that the saffron party was responsible for the AIADMK’s assembly poll debacle “as minorities voted against the alliance”, AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami released a statement reiterating that the alliance formed for the assembly poll would continue and the party lost the election by just 3% votes. The joint statement came a few hours after O Panneerselvam — in a tweet in which he tagged PM Modi, Amit Shah and J P Nadda — said the AIADMK had full faith in the BJP and the PM and there was no second opinion on continuation of the AIADMK-BJP alliance which was in the interest of the nation and for the welfare of Tamil Nadu. It all began with Shanmugam’s speech at a party meeting in Villupuram on Tuesday where he said people did not want the DMK to form the government nor M K Stalin to become the CM. “The main reason for our defeat was our alliance with the BJP,” he had said. Senior BJP leaders took to Twitter on Wednesday to express their displeasure. “Actually, it’s the other way around,” tweeted actor and BJP leader Khushbu Sundar. “We too think ‘it’s because of you’,” senior BJP leader K T Raghavan tweeted in Tamil. Raghavan argued that the saffron party had formed the government in many states and at the Centre with the support of the minorities. Raghavan said the BJP had analysed the poll results. “Our party felt that the four-year performance of the AIADMK government may be the reason for the defeat. We wanted to uphold alliance dharma. We never go public to blame alliance partners. The former minister’s comment is unacceptable. We believe their party high command will give a proper explanation on the issue,” said Raghavan. Shanmugham while addressing partymen said, “The main reason for our defeat was our alliance with the BJP. The minorities could not accept our alliance with the BJP as their principles and ideologies are completely different.” He said he himself lost to a DMK candidate by 14,000-odd votes from Villupuram constituency that has 20,000 minority votes. He pointed out that the difference in vote share between DMK and AIADMK was a meagre 3%, roughly 13 lakh votes. “A swing of five or six lakh votes could have changed the poll outcome,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/bjp-spars-with-ex-min-of-aiadmk-over-poll-defeat-minority-votes/articleshow/84217325.cms||Bosco Dominique
---||Delhi||Rehab colony residents to get ownership right||New Delhi: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has decided to grant ownership right to the residents of Parda Bagh Rehabilitation Colony in Daryaganj. According to an order issued by the land and estate department on Monday, at least 50 allottees of residential plots have been assured ownership rights. “Before executing the process, the structure of the built-up area is required to be regularised as per the SDMC building bylaws. Each plot will measure 70 square yards,” the order stated. Anything beyond the permissible limit will be marked as encroachment and removed as a mandatory condition, it said, adding that if residents fail to remove such encroachments, SDMC will remove them and necessary action such as cancellation of allotment will be initiated. A perpetual lease deed of 99 years will be executed as per the prevailing circler rates and ground rent will be charged as per rules. The decision has been taken on the basis of an approval given by the standing committee in December and passing of a resolution in January. “The matter was pending for a long time. The properties are currently given on licence,” said an official. After receiving applications, the department will conduct a survey and measure the houses to rule out any encroachment. “We may make the properties freehold later. The owners can develop the property as per the building bylaws and enjoy FARs approved in the master plan,” said the official. All conditions mentioned in the redevelopment plan of Parda Bagh Rehabilitation Colony, approved by the standing committee in 2016, will be applicable to the residential properties. The services will be laid and later maintained as per norms of the respective service/engineering departments of SDMC. Development, augmentation and other charges will be recovered from the owners by the engineering department. The building department will have to obtain all necessary no-objection certificates such as approval from the chief forest officer and Delhi Urban Art Commission, and environment and ASI clearances at the time of sanctioning the building plan. “The redevelopment plan also included the local commercial site. After completing the residential work, we will start granting the ownership right to the shops. The standard plan for the shop plots will be prepared by the architecture department before sanctioning the building plan,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rehab-colony-residents-to-get-ownership-right/articleshow/84252070.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Goa||If clubs want to win ISL, they know whom to call, says Hugo Boumous||Panaji: Hugo Boumous has been left in no doubt that he can deliver for ATK Mohun Bagan. Just like Mumbai City FC and FC Goa before them.] ATKMB paid an undisclosed transfer fee to secure the services of the attacking midfielder from Mumbai City FC. The move left Indian football followers stunned. After all, just last season, Mumbai broke the record with a fee of Rs 1.76 crore, including taxes, to take the French star away from Goa. “It’s something new for Indian football to have two transfer records being broken in as many years (for the same player),” said Boumous, speaking exclusively to TOI on Thursday. “I am grateful to the clubs who have such faith in me. I can understand why they do that. I am young, competing well and the teams are winning (trophies). I was the best player (while at Goa) and again best last season. I feel it’s normal. Clubs know whom to call if they want to win the league.” Nobody wants to win the league as much as ATK Mohun Bagan, in the words of their new signing, “the most ambitious club in India.” The Kolkata giants lost the final against Mumbai last season, and just days earlier, lost the chance to represent India at the high-profile AFC Champions League after finishing second in the league standings, behind Mumbai. “ATK Mohun Bagan have ambitions to succeed not just in the country but Asia. It matches my ambition. That’s one of the reasons, besides the club’s rich history and fans, why I chose to join. They presented the best project. “With the team that we have, our aim is to win everything. I won the league previously with Goa and last year with Mumbai. My target now is to win the league and qualify for the Champions League in my first season itself (with Bagan),” said Boumous. If he had stayed at either of his last two clubs, Boumous would have had a chance to make his debut in Asian football’s premier club competition. But he chose to turn his back. With ATKMB, where he has a five-year contract, the goals are different. “My aim is to qualify again (for the Champions League) with ATK Mohun Bagan. Of course, I could have played with Mumbai and Goa where I enjoyed playing with both teams. Football, though, sometimes is complicated. Hopefully, I’ll be able to play with my new club,” he said. At 25, Boumous is among the younger foreign players in ISL and has been a major success story. In 2019-20, he won the Golden Ball, for best player, and Pass of the League, for highest assists. His 11 goals and 10 assists in just 15 matches propelled Goa to the top. Last season, despite injuries and a four-match suspension, the midfielder was again on song, scoring three goals and seven assists in Mumbai’s rise as champions. Now, as Bagan break the transfer record and offer him a five-year contract – unheard of in Indian football for foreigners – Boumous is eager to make an instant impact. “The (five-year) contract shows the trust that the club has in me,” said Boumous. “I have been in India for three years and I have enjoyed since the beginning. ATK Mohun Bagan is a historic and successful club with a massive fan base. I am sure I’ll enjoy this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/if-clubs-want-to-win-isl-they-know-whom-to-call-says-hugo-boumous/articleshow/84249794.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ED arrests Eknath Khadse’s son-in-law in land deal, summons ex-minister today||MUMBAI: After several hours of questioning through Tuesday, the ED early on Wednesday arrested Girish Chaudhari, son-in-law of the state’s former revenue minister Eknath Khadse, in a money laundering case related to the MIDC land deal in Pune, report Vijay V Singh and Rebecca Samervel. Chaudhari was produced before a PMLA court, which remanded him in ED custody till July 12. Meanwhile, ED summoned Khadse for a further statement on Thursday. It had recorded his statement earlier in January. The ED’s case is based on a state Anti-Corruption Bureau FIR that has accused Khadse, his wife Mandakini, Chaudhri and one Abbas Ukani for land grab of a MIDC plot in Bhosari, Pune district, and causing a loss of Rs 61.25 crore to the government by fraudulently entering into a sale deed. The ED probe showed Chaudhari, in connivance with others, entered into a sale deed to avail compensation over 2.5-3 times the actual value of the land. The land originally belonged to Ukani and was reserved for MIDC. There was a legal dispute between Ukani and the government over compensation to surrender the land. During investigation, it was found that Chaudhari claimed the source of funds to purchase the property as loan from some companies. However, these funds were layered and routed through shell companies, which are either dysfunctional or ceased to exist later on, the ED said.In Chaudhari’s remand application, the ED stated the land was acquired by MIDC and there were various industries on the plot, so it was not possible to execute the sale deed with its original owner Ukani in April 2016 for Rs 3.75 crore. The ED alleged Khadse and others made illegal changes and alteration in government record to execute the deal. It was alleged Khadse had misused his minister’s post in 2016. Subsequently Khadse as revenue minister in the BJP-Sena government, pressurised his ministry’s officials to acquire the land from his kin after paying them Rs 61 crore compensation. The sub-registrar had earlier provided the value of the plot as Rs 31 crore, but Khadse coerced government officials to reduce market value of the plot to Rs 3.75 crore on government record, the ED said. It created a controversy before the payment of compensation, and subsequently Khadse was forced to resign from the post. Khadse is now with NCP. Chaudhari’s advocate Mohan Tekavde opposed the remand plea and said he had cooperated with the investigations. “Girish Chaudhari is being targeted only because he is the son-in-law of Eknath Khadse. He has been falsely implicated. There is no evidence to show that any loss of Rs 61 crore was caused to the exchequer as the ED has claimed. Further, it has not been proved that the disputed land belongs to MIDC,” Tekavde said. In his earlier statement to the ED, Khadse had denied any knowledge about the land deal after stating that it was executed by his wife and the son-in-law. In this statement to the ED, Chaudhari said that he, along with mother-in-law, had purchased the land from Ukani and he found the plot through a local agent. But Chaudhari refused to provide details of the local agent, claimed ED officials. Chaudhari further told ED officials that he was aware the land was reserved for the MIDC, but he was advised that there was no need to take any NOC from MIDC. Chaudhari told ED officials that he raised the Rs 2 crore loan from Benchmark Buildcon Pvt Ltd as its chief director Om Prakash was known to him since 2003. But Chaudhari refused to provide details of Om Prakash, said ED in the remand application. The application further added that Benchmark Buildcon Pvt Ltd was a shell company, it received the money from five other suspicious companies which was immediately routed to Chaudhari for purchasing the plot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ed-arrests-khadses-son-in-law-in-land-deal-summons-ex-min-today/articleshow/84221254.cms||Vijay V Singh

A two-time president of the Panjab University Students’ Council, Kang was also the spokesperson of BJP’s state unit and a member of the party’s core group for Punjab. Kang was formally inducted into the party by Punjab affairs in-charge Jarnail Singh, leader of opposition (LoP) Harpal Singh Cheema and MLA Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer. “I quit the BJP against the farm laws in October last year, as despite long protest by farmers the party refused to address their concerns. Punjab needs an alternative politics... Congress and Akalis have ruined the state financially. The money-spinning sectors like mining, excise and transport have been taken over by political mafias. On the other hand, the Kejriwal-led Delhi government has delivered by practicing issue-based politics, which is also the need of the hour in Punjab,” he said. Jarnail informed that Kang was also the national executive member of the BJP Yuva Morcha and served as the in-charge of the Haryana Yuva Morcha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kang-who-quit-bjp-over-farm-laws-joins-aap/articleshow/84217348.cms||---

---||Pune||Dilip Saab saw Mughal-e-Azam for the first time at FTII in Pune||PUNE: Very few fans of The First Khan may know that Dilip Saab watched his epic Mughal-e-Azam for the first time at the Main Theatre of Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) in Pune, almost 18 years after the magnum opus was released. “Way back in the summer of 1978, Dilip Kumar wanted to see 15 classics. PK Nair, noted archivist from National Film Archive of India (NFAI), arranged the screening of the films at FTII’s Main Theatre. The 15 films selected were of his wife Saira Banu’s choice,” said Bhupendra Kainthola, director, FTII. Then, over the next 15 days, Dilip Kumar saw a film every day at the institute and Saira Banu was by his side as he watched Mughal-e-Azam. Later, the star was invited as the chief guest at the FTII convocation ceremony held on December 14, 1997. Dr Mohan Agashe, then director of the institute, and Mahesh Bhatt, chairman of FTII, were also present. Sound designer Resul Pookutty received his certificate from noted director Mahesh Bhatt. Also, seen are then FTII director Dr Mohan Agashe and Dilip Kumar (right)“FTII has unforgettable memories of Dilip Kumar. That the living legend spent a good 15 days watching some classics here must have added to the artistic vibrancy of the institute, which has produced the who’s who of India’s cinema and entertainment industry over the last six decades,” Kainthola said. Noted actor Dr Mohan Agashe shared a warm friendship with the thespian. “We wanted to invite him and actor Shashi Kapoor for the 100th show of our play ‘Ghashiram Kotwal’ in Mumbai. Both actors had heard about the play and readily agreed to the invitation. It was a memorable show for us. Later, in 1976, he had come to Pune and he invited the entire group of Theatre Academy for tea at the Turf Club. He used to love staying at the Turf Club and had a favourite room there,” said Agashe, while speaking with TOI. Agashe recalled that director Dr Jabbar Patel wanted to make a film titled O Babajaan with Dilip Kumar. “We used to meet quite frequently during those six-seven months when work on the film was underway. Unfortunately, the film never got made but I remember Dilip Kumar used to improvise the scenes to make it easy for the script writers. Once our discussions went on for quite long. Jabbar and I started fidgeting as we had a show of the play lined up. Dilip Kumar asked us what was wrong. When we told him about the show, he came running bare feet to his Mercedes and drove us to the theatre,” Agashe recalled. Dilip Kumar understood Marathi and he knew a lot about Marathi Sangeet Rangbhoomi. “He used to play the harmonium and hum the natyageet quite well,” Agashe said. In 1997, when Agashe was the director of FTII, the convocation ceremony was being held after a long gap as the institute was weathering an agitation by students. “I invited Dilip Kumar because I wanted the convocation to be memorable for the students. The students, unfortunately, created a ruckus during the function. However, Dilip Kumar never lost his dignity and continued to give away the certificates. During his speech, he told students that they were fortunate that they have the opportunity to study here and he had none. ‘Don’t wash your dirty linen in public, resolve the issues with the management,’ was his message,” said Agashe who later collaborated with him in the film Mashal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/saab-saw-mughal-e-azam-for-the-first-time-at-ftii/articleshow/84217377.cms||Manjiri Damle

---||Delhi||After retiring, DERC chief writes to LG, seeks 2-yr extension||New Delhi: Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) chairman Justice (retd) Satyendra Singh Chauhan, who retired from the position on July 4 after attaining the age of 65 years, has written a letter to the lieutenant governor of Delhi, requesting him to extend the appointment of the chairman till the age of 67 years or till the new incumbent joins. In the letter, Justice Chauhan has written that in the Madras Bar Association versus Union of India case, the Supreme Court ordered that the retirement age of chairman and members should be as 67 years. Justice Chauhan had joined DERC on July 5, 2018 and has completed three years and has written that there cannot be any difference between a commission and a tribunal where a high court judge is appointed after his retirement. In the letter written recently, Justice Chauhan stated that DERC is headed by him and would be without chairman on July 4, 2021, when he demits office. To balance the public interest of the office and taking into consideration the welfare of electricity consumers, it would be proper for the lieutenant governor to consider the extension of his appointment in the same terms as held by the Supreme Court in the case of Madras Bar Association, he requested in the letter. When contacted by TOI, Justice Chauhan confirmed that he has written the letter. In the letter, Justice Chauhan has written that the LG has been “taking great steps to improve the Delhi administration and taken it to a great heights.” The letter also mentions that the selection process for the chairman and member was initiated by the Delhi government on March 1, 2021 and the contents of the advertisement would indicate that the post of Member Legal has not been advertised. The letter mentions that in view of the judgement of the Supreme Court on April 12, 2018, it has been made mandatory for the regulatory commissions to have a legal member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-retiring-derc-chief-writes-to-lg-seeks-2-yr-extension/articleshow/84252113.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Screen legend laid to rest with full state honours||MUMBAI: Dilip Kumar, the Aakhri Mughal of Hindi cinema, was laid to rest at Santacruz Kabrastan Wednesday evening. The North Star that guided the ships of generations of actors that followed, was eclipsed as dawn broke. India’s senior most artiste’s death at age 98 may not have been unexpected given the age-related ailments and recent frequent visits to hospital. Still, fans were sad and disappointed that the beloved thespian did not live to cross the age of 100. Friend Faisal Farooqui, who runs the actor’s official Twitter handle, said, “Sahab’s lungs had become very weak and he suffered multiple age-related ailments. On Tuesday night, his blood pressure dropped and it then became difficult for doctors to remove the excess fluid from his lungs. He passed away shortly after 7am.” Dilip Kumar was awarded a state funeral. Police draped his remains in the tricolour and the marching band performed at his Pali Hill residence in Bandra before the coffin was led to Santacruz. The bier was lifted by nephews Rehan, actor Ayub Khan, Imran and Saqib, and Farooqui. The last rites were completed at 5pm. Santacruz Kabrastan is where the family graves are located. It is also the resting place for most of Hindi cinema’s yesteryear celebrities. Saira Banu’s mother, veteran actress Naseem Bano, her grandmother and other family elders are buried here along with Madhubala, Mohammed Rafi, Sahir Ludhianvi, Naushad, Ali Sardar Jafri, Talat Mahmood, K A Abbas, Parveen Babi and Tahir Hussain. In fact, Dilip Kumar and Saira Banu had requested the government to grant the trust a neighbouring plot to accommodate more graves. On Wednesday a stream of dignitaries from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, his son Aaditya, film celebrities Dharmendra, Shabana Azmi, Shah Rukh Khan, Vidya Balan, Siddharth Roy Kapur, Ranbir Kapoor and Subhash Ghai went to offer condolence to the family at the bungalow. Amitabh Bachchan and son Abhishek visited the gravesite and stood with heads bowed in respect. A sea of blue ticks offered tribute on Twitter, from President Ram Nath Kovind and Pr-ime Minister Narendra Modi to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and South superstars Mammooty and Chiranjeevi. Only 20 people may have been permitted inside the cemetery owing to Covid protocol, but it was tough to prevent hundreds of fans from lining the roads to catch a glimpse of the artiste who symbolised an era of grace and dignity. Much praise went to Saira Banu, Dilip Kumar’s wife of 55 years. “She was inconsolable when PM Modi rang to offer condolences early in the morning,” Farooqui said. “If ever a chronicle is written about devoted wives in the modern era, Saira Banu will figure in that list for the next century. She scarcely left his bedside in hospital even to eat her meals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-screen-legend-laid-to-rest-with-full-state-honours/articleshow/84217391.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Dehradun||India ruled by law, not shastras: Uttarakhand HC||NAINITAL: Days after the Uttarakhand high court put a stay on the Char Dham yatra and asked for the rituals to be livestreamed, the court on Wednesday took exception to the submission by the advocate general (AG) that "shastras might not permit livestreaming of the rituals". To this, the court replied: "India is a democratic country ruled by law, not by shastras.” The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma asked AG SN Babulkar to not get into religious arguments as they have no legal backing. “If there is a bar in the IT Act then please show me those provisions of the Act which say no livestreaming can be permitted from the temple,” the chief justice said. The AG had submitted that a decision on allowing livestreaming would be taken by the Devasthanam board — which manages temples in the state — but added that according to some Char Dham priests Hindu shastras do not permit livestreaming of rituals. The court reacted sharply to the submission and said: “…Shastras do not control this country, what controls this country and guides us for our future is the Constitution of India and that’s where we stop. We cannot go beyond the constitution and the laws thereunder… We are a democratic country ruled by rule of law. We are not a democratic country ruled by the rule of shastras.” Even in the last hearing, the AG had made similar submissions and the bench had said that since our ancestors were not even aware of development of a technology which would allow livestreaming, the possibility of “shastras prohibiting livestreaming of a religious ceremony is absolutely impossible”. In its hearing on Wednesday, the chief justice added that he has read the shastras and nowhere do they prohibit such a technology. The court said that if the Devasthanam board decides to not allow livestreaming they would have to explain which line of which shastra prohibits use of such technology. The AG has been asked to inform the court about the decision taken by the board in the next hearing on July 28. Earlier, the state cabinet had allowed residents in Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi districts to visit the shrines in their respective districts. The yatra was to start on July 1. The court had then ordered a four-week stay on the yatra, calling the cabinet’s decision “arbitrary and unreasonable”. The state government has challenged the order in the apex court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/india-ruled-by-law-not-shastras-ukhand-hc/articleshow/84214964.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Amritsar||Ex-gangster shot, old accomplice arrested||BATHINDA: Gangster-turned-social activist Kulbir Singh of Naruana village in Bathinda district and one of his gunmen Chamkaur Singh were killed allegedly by his old accomplice on Wednesday morning. Gurpreet Singh, another aide, was injured in the shootout outside Kulbir’s residence in the village. Accused Manjinder Singh Manna has been arrested and two weapons used in the crime seized from him. In all, eight rounds were fired, sources said. The gangster-turned-activist (39) had survived a similar attack 17 days back, when someone fired at his bullet-proof SUV near Bathinda. Later, one Bhalla Sekhu in a Facebook post had taken responsibility for the attack, saying his accomplice Fateh Nagri had fired at Kulbir. Manjinder Singh Manna from Talwandi Sabo had been with Kulbir for several years and was his trusted lieutenant. Sources said Manna had a fight with Kulbir’s close associate Aziz at Talwandi Sabo two days ago. Kulbir had called both for a compromise and scolded Manna. “Manna reached Kulbir’s residence in his SUV on Wednesday morning. They spent some time in the vehicle and even had green tea. When Kulbir came out of the SUV and was heading towards the gate, Manna fired three shots at him. As Kulbir’s gunmen Chamkaur and Gurpreet rushed to his rescue, Manna fired at them too and sped away. An injured Chamkaur was also run over by the SUV. Kulbir, Chamkaur and Gurpreet were taken to a hospital where Kulbir and Chamkaur were declared dead,” said Bathinda SSP Bhupinderjit Singh Virk. Sources said Manna, who had taken drugs and stopped near Ghudda village, fell unconscious on the road. A policeman took him to a community health centre and informed the Bathinda police. Later, police took him into custody and brought him to a hospital, cops said. Kulbir had over a dozen cases of attempt to murder, arms act against him but was acquitted in a number of cases and had been cosying up with politicians. He had joined SAD on March 25, 2014, in the presence of then revenue minister Bikram Singh Majithia and MLA Jeet Mohinder Singh Sidhu. On January 10, 2015, he had fired at police head constable Gursewak Singh at the Cantt police station of Bathinda and was arrested on January 18. He was also involved in a gang war in Bathinda central jail on April 16, 2015, where some inmates had been injured in firing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/ex-gangster-shot-old-accomplice-arrested/articleshow/84217395.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Pune||Delhi resident held for circulating photographs of minor girl based in Pune||PUNE: The Pune cyber police on Monday arrested a 28-year-old Delhi resident on the charge of circulating objectionable photographs of a 14-year-old girl based in Pune. A team headed by senior inspector DS Hake and inspector Sangeeta Mali arrested the suspect, Nirajkumar Ramshabad, from his residence and took his transit remand from a Delhi court on Monday. He was brought to Pune on Wednesday morning and was produced before a city court, which ordered his remand in police custody till July 12. The girl’s family had lodged a case with the cyber police on April 1 after realizing that the man, who works as an executive with a private company in Delhi, had circulated her photographs to many people, police said. Police said the girl was a student at a city-based school. The girl had been attending online school and other tutorials. She had downloaded several games from different online gaming sites/platforms on her cellphone. “One of the games had the option of playing online with different players. The person could play online with either friends or strangers,” Mali said. “Ramshabad too played online games on a cellphone application with strangers or friends. Ramshabad and the girl started interacting on the gaming platform, following which they started chatting on other messenger sites,” Mali said. “He pretended to be a good friend and requested the girl to send some photographs to him. She then sent some photographs in an objectionable manner to him, which he then circulated among his friends. The girl found out about it online and approached the police,” she said. Police arrested him under sections 354D (Stalking), 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. Police have also invoked the provisions of the Information Technology (IT) Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act against the suspect.

The suspect then told him he would have to pay the company’s person. “I transferred Rs 2.5 lakh to him,” the complainant said. “I became suspicious when he started demanding more money. I then decided to approach the police,” the techie said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/techie-duped-of-rs-2-5l-with-promise-of-job-overseas/articleshow/84217401.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Mumbai||Centre allows private hospitals to buy more vax, place order directly on CoWin||MUMBAI: Private hospitals will now be able to procure slightly more vaccines as the Centre has revised the formula for calculating the ‘maximum order quantity’ (MOQ), a week after first finalising the plan. Previously, it was decided that a hospital’s monthly MOQ would be double the average daily consumption from one of their best performing weeks from the previous months. The limit has now been increased to triple the average consumption, state officials said. In a series of online meetings on Wednesday, Central officials told private centres they could start placing orders through CoWin over the next few days in four instalments or at one go. They were supposed to place orders through CoWin from July 1, but haven’t been able to do so. The Centre has developed two criteria for deciding the MOQ. Firstly, for hospitals that are already vaccinating since the past few months, performance from one of their best performing weeks will be taken as a benchmark to derive their MOQ. Secondly, for newer centres, their bed capacity will be used as a criterion. Hospitals with less than 50 beds can order up to 3,000 doses at the most, 51-300 bed hospitals can order 6,000 doses, 301-500 bed hospitals can buy up to 10,000 doses and hospitals with more than 500 beds can order 15,000 doses. It has also been clarified that the vaccine delivery could happen either from manufacturers directly or through the state or corporation delivery channel. A private hospital head told TOI if they are opting for delivery through state government or BMC, a hospital can place a minimum order of 160 doses of Covaxin and 500 doses of Covishield. If they want direct delivery from the manufacturers, though, they have to order at least 2,880 doses of Covaxin and 6,000 doses of Covishield. The payment will go to the manufacturers directly. Importantly, state immunisation officials will have access to information about how many vaccine orders have been placed by the private hospitals, their payment status and how soon the deliveries will be made. Another CEO of a private hospital said the new formula is logical, and performance driven. “It will stop hoarding,” he said. He added that the vaccinations done through tie-ups will not be considered while deciding the maximum order eligibility of a hospital. “It will purely be based on vaccinations done at the hospital,” he said. The state official said since hospitals can place a minimum order of 160 and 500 doses, it will empower even smaller players to procure doses. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said the private hospital supply may be streamlined by this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/centre-allows-pvt-hosps-to-buy-more-vax-place-order-directly-on-cowin/articleshow/84221271.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The civic body is planting thousands of saplings and decorative shrubs, and undertaking ground vegetation, besides maintaining/redoing the green lawns at gardens, happiness areas, roundabouts and selfie points to improve aesthetics. NDMC has set a target of 3,850 trees and 5 lakh shrubs for 2021-22. During Van Mahotsava, 1,475 trees and 99,831 shrubs will be planted. “The majority of trees and shrubs are being planted during Van Mahotsav, which will last till the coming weekend. With the regular watering of plants during the monsoon, the survival becomes easier. We are involving around 50 residents’ welfare associations to plant trees and ensure their survival,” said an official. For uninterrupted water supply post-monsoon, NDMC is seeking permission from the chief secretary to allow operations of some borewells that had been disconnected on National Green Tribunal’s direction. “Around 100 borewells have been disconnected in the area, leading to a lot of inconvenience. Recently, the chief secretary called a joint meeting on NGT’s direction and asked Delhi Jal Board to come out with a concrete plan to supply water through sewage treatment plants,” said the official. NDMC has covered parks, central verge and roadside green lawns at Lodhi Colony, Bharti Nagar, Laxmibai Nagar, Sanjay Jheel, Shantipath-Chanakyapuri, South Avenue and Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone. Different species include chiku (sapota), amaltas, gulmohar, bottlebrush, kachnar, bottle palm, ashok, neem, arjun, maulsari, champa, nimbu, jatropha, hibiscus, hamelia and chandni. NDMC covers 3% of the total area of Delhi, but has 64.5% green cover with six major gardens and three international relationship memorial parks. “There are five rose gardens, 135 avenues of 270km length, eight nurseries, three hi-tech nurseries, 51 roundabouts, three happiness parks, 24 vertical gardens at different locations, 123 residential parks, 501 CPWD colony parks and one NDMC School of Gardening, all of which are being covered during the drive,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/on-green-mission-ndmc-starts-3-wk-plantation-drive/articleshow/84252187.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Locals identified the deceased as Manoj Thaokar. Preliminary information revealed that Thaokar’s two-wheeler allegedly hit a police sub-inspector on nakabandi duty on Pardi road, reports Proshun Chakraborty. The upset cops bashed Thaokar mercilessly and later took him to Pardi police station and started the procedure to arrest him by filing an FIR. Before the police could complete the process, it is learnt that Thaokar fell unconscious at the police station itself. The cops then rushed him to Shri Bhawani Multispeciality Hospital And Research Institute in Pardi, where the doctors declared him brought dead. As the news spread, relatives of the deceased and residents of the area gathered in large numbers outside the police station demanding action against the cops. Senior police officers, including commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar, DCP Neelotpal among others rushed to the Pardi police station. Quick response teams and anti-riot squads were also posted to prevent any untoward incident. Senior PI Sunil Gangurde was not available for his comments. State CID officers reached Pardi spot and the incident is being treated as ‘deemed custodial death’. After accidental death is registered, the state CID is likely to take over the case. Postmortem would be done in the presence of a magistrate and video recorded. A team of doctors would be conducting the post-mortem. The deceased was physically challenged and also visually impaired.

Despite maximum military decorations, more than double of the next best state, Punjab has only one Sainik School, which is in Kapurthala, and it wants two more — one in Gurdaspur and the other in Bathinda. Haryana, Bihar, and Maharashtra have two Sainik Schools each, while Uttar Pradesh has three. The defence minister assured Manpreet that he appreciated the role of Sikhs and Punjabis in national security and defence and will consider the proposal. Manpreet also passed on a letter from chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to Rajnath about how the state government had allocated 40 acres at Dalla Gorian village in Gurdaspur district for one of the required Sainik Schools. If Bathinda also gets one, all three Punjab regions (Doaba, Majha, and Malwa) will have a Sainik School each. The finance minister sought the defence ministry’s clearance for a bus terminus in Bathinda. The proposed site is close to the Bathinda military station, which must have a clear radius of 100 metres. Manpreet told Rajnath that the proposed terminus building will be well below the prescribed height for structures around military bases. He also invited the defence minister to Punjab War Heroes’ Memorial in Amritsar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/manpreet-meets-rajnath-for-building-2-sainik-schools-in-punjab/articleshow/84217477.cms||---

The court then directed the same, noting that this will not prejudice the rights of either parties, and all questions in the case will remain open for hearing later. The petitioner Dhairya Bansod’s parents had contended that the school management failed to restart his online classes, despite clear orders from the HC in the last hearing. “We direct the school authorities to admit the petitioner to KG-II and let him attend classes online from July 8, if they are being held regularly. Arrears of fees and first instalment of fees to be paid, as assured before this court. This is being done without prejudice to the respective rights of both sides and keeping all questions open,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said. Earlier, the Sadar-based school’s lawyer Wilson Mathew pointed out that the petitioner’s parents had failed to pay the arrears of KG-I and first instalment of KG-II. Petitioner’s counsel Ravi Sanyal then made a statement that they would deposit the arrears of Rs33,400 and first instalment of Rs18,520 within a week but “under protest”. Wilson then said the school would admit petitioner in KG-II and also permit him to attend online classes from Thursday. Dhairya had approached the HC through his father Pritesh after the school withheld his KG-I results asking him to pay full fees of Rs86,800. It also stopped his promotion to KG-II.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/parents-school-agree-in-hc-to-start-5-yr-olds-online-classes/articleshow/84215000.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Starch sold as mucormycosis medicine||AHMEDABAD: While desperate relatives made beelines outside pharmacies for crucial drugs for their loved ones battling mucormycosis, little did they know that the posaconazole drug sold to them under the brand name Cuvicon was actually starch powder. This is the country’s first detected case of fake mucormycosis drugs. The state food and drugs administration (FDCA) last week tackled the counterfeit drug being supplied by a Telangana firm which had no licence for manufacturing the drug. The company produced tablets and syrups claiming it had posaconazole, which is approved as prophylaxis for invasive fungal infections in patients. “Generally, after amphotericin-B injection is administered, doctors prescribe posaconazole tablets or syrup to patients with mucormycosis. Each tablet costs Rs 1,000 and a bottle of syrup costs roughly Rs 20,500,” says Gujarat FDCA commissioner HG Koshia. The FDCA had received lab reports on Tuesday which confirmed that the tablets were counterfeit. It is worth pointing out that within a span of eight months the FDCA had detected a range of Covid counterfeit drug scams which include tocilizumab, remdesivir, favipiravir and now posaconazole. In Ahmedabad, Siddha pharmacy, and in Surat, Ambika pharma located near Jhapa Bazaar, used to procure the drugs from the manufacturer based in Turkapalli town in Hyderabad, called Astra Generics Private Limited. The Telangana-based marketing firm Aspen Biopharm is said to have supplied the counterfeit drugs to Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Surat based pharmacies. According to the press release by FDCA, Vardhaman Pharma in Paldi, Shukan Medicals on Science City Rad and Delvich Healthcare at Sola Bhagwat Vidyapith were selling the counterfeit drug. In the state capital, Gandhinagar, the fake drug was being sold from Polvet Care Pharmacy in Sector 26. “We fear that the marketing firm Aspen has been selling the counterfeit drug to many pharmacies across the country. We have alerted various state FDCA offices regarding this,” says Koshia. When asked how they detected the presence of the spurious medicine, Koshia explained that his intelligence division was tipped off on the availability of posaconazole in a few pharmacies in the city. “After we procured a few syrup bottles, we found that Cuvicon had not approached the FDCA offices in Telengana and Gujarat for manufacturing licence and supply of the drug. These samples were immediately sent to the laboratory for tests where they were reported to be counterfeit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/starch-sold-as-mm-medicine/articleshow/84217708.cms||---

With their previous year’s results nullified, these students will now have to wait for their fresh scores till August 17. This would lead to a further delay in getting their final year marksheets too, say students. Many have secured conditional offer letters from universities abroad and some have even applied for loans. A final-year student from five-year LLB programme, who has an offer letter from Cambridge University, said, “The university expects us to submit the final transcripts by month-end. All these top universities have a waitlist. If students fail to confirm admissions, they will offer the seat to the next candidate.” The students are not against holding the exam, but they added that MU could have avoided last-minute delays. “Though many foreign universities offer an extended deadline, this is unnecessarily adding to our anxiety,” said the student. Another student, who has a seat at King’s College London, must submit all his marksheets by August 27. “I am not sure if MU will be able to give all the marksheets if the results only are announced on August 17. Processing visa will also be a problem,” he said. Another student said that this delay will affect their plans to pursue LLM or even jobs, adding that they are seeking legal advice to move court. A circular from MU on Monday announced that results issued last year on the basis of previous performances and internal assessments are withdrawn. Director, Board of Examination and Evaluation, Vinod Patil, clarified that the final-year results of students who will be giving the exam will be issued only after August 17. “We will try to issue the final results as early as possible,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-law-students-aiming-for-foreign-univs-left-in-lurch/articleshow/84217493.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh FIR: Probe panel that reinstated Sachin Waze, HC tells CBI||MUMBAI: Referring to the Supreme Court’s observations that former state home minister Anil Deshmukh and for mer Mumbai police commisioner Param Bir Singh were working in close confidence, the Bombay high court on Wednesday asked the CBI if its probe was “broad based” and looking into the reinstatement of Sachin Waze as assistant police inspector last year. The committee that reinstated Waze was headed by Singh. A bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar said, “Whoever is head of administration at the relevant time cannot claim helplessness or innocence. It was equally the duty of such an officer to prevent it at the relevant time.” The HC was hearing a quashing petition filed by Deshmukh against the first information report (FIR) registered against him and “unknown persons” by the CBI on April 21 under the Prevention of Corruption Act for undue advantage. CBI to HC: Moving with discretion as public figure involved The HC, hearing a quashing petition by former state home minister Anil Deshmukh against the FIR filed against him and “unknown persons” by the CBI under the Prevention of Corruption Act for undue advantage, in the verbal exchange with additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi for CBI, said, “What we expect from the CBI that the probe be broad based and that everyone responsible will be booked.” Lekhi replied, “The investigation will be broad based and cover everyone. But for that, it has to proceed.” The HC said it has passed no interim order for stay of probe so far. Lekhi said the probe was not being withheld in any manner, but it was a “multi-layer complex investigation”. He said CBI is “tracing the trend” and that “no exception will be made for any person...it is not as if the agency will play favourites”. But, Lekhi said, the HC’s April 5 order for a preliminary investigation empowers the CBI to investigate allegations against Deshmukh. He added that as a public person is involved, “the agency is moving with discretion...” “If the petitioner is anticipating a chargesheet, then there is some feeling of guilt...Otherwise he should be open to let the probe continue,” he added. Lekhi said an FIR is not expected to give all details, and the annexures also have to be factored in—Singh’s letter to the CM against Deshmukh over his alleged “corrupt malpractices” and advocate Jaishri Patil’s complaint to Malabar Hill police citing the letter. It had alleged that De-shmukh had told Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore every mo-nth from restaurants and bars. Amit Desai, senior counsel for Deshmukh, said, “The FIR doesn’t have a single averment of fact to suggest that Deshmu-kh committed any offence or that he received any money.” He added that even on June 11, in its affidavit in HC, the CBI never said he received any money, it only alleged an “attempt” and made claims of transfers and postings with undue influence without any particulars of alleged extortion. He argued that Singh’s lett-er was “motivated because of his transfer” and contained “false claims”, and Deshmukh had resigned on “moral grounds”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cbi-to-hc-moving-with-discretion-as-public-figure-involved/articleshow/84217566.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: FDCA inquiry biased in C R Paatil’s case, says Paresh Dhanani||AHMEDABAD: The leader of opposition in the state assembly, Paresh Dhanani, has termed the inquiry into BJP president C R Paatil’s distribution of remdesivir injections during the surge of Covid-19 pandemic as “politically motivated” and “completely biased” and said that the conclusion of the inquiry is apparent. Dhanani has criticised the clean chit given by the Food and Drug Control Administration (FDCA) into distribution of 5,000 remdesivir injections in April from BJP’s Surat office. In his affidavit filed before the Gujarat high court in connection with his PIL seeking action into the episode, Dhanani has stated, “Respondent No 7 (FDCA) has carried out absolutely perfunctory, premeditated and peripheral inquiry inconsistent with the statutory obligation and devoid of their statutory functions and duties.” FDCA has cited its subordinated officers’ preliminary inquiry and said that the distribution of the remdesivir injections was an act of charity. Dhanani has taken exception to this and asserted that majority of statements recorded by the officials were by the “potential accused”. He has claimed that no independent inquiry has been carried out so far as it appears that FDCA is not above obvious suspicion. Dhanani added, “Any layman can come to conclusion that Respondent No 4’s (BJP MLA Harsh Sanghavi) story to justify the distribution is a cock and bull story. The petitioner is waiting for the inquiry to be completed…The inquiry conducted is politically motivated and is completely biased and its conclusion is apparent.” He said that he would counter the inquiry with visuals and evidence and show that FDCA is making “blatant false and frivolous statement on oath to mislead the court and it is contempt of the court”. He has questioned the presence of medical staff during the distribution. Dhanani has also submitted that his PIL is maintainable. He cited the orders of the Supreme Court and the high court to justify why stocking and distribution of remdesivir amounts to hoarding, when the drug was an essential commodity and its distribution was strictly regulated by the government by two different orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fdca-inquiry-biased-in-paatils-case-dhanani/articleshow/84217695.cms||---
---||Delhi||HC seeks stand of Centre, Delhi on ‘grain wastage’||New Delhi:Delhi High Court on Thursday sought response from the Centre and Delhi government on a plea alleging wastage of foodgrains and dry kit purchased under the Mukhya Mantri Corona Sahayata Yojana due to mismanagement. “By and large, there should be minimum wastage and maximum distribution of foodgrains to poor and needy,” said a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh as it issued notice in a PIL filed by an NGO. The NGO, Sampurna represented by advocate Piyush Beriwal, sought direction for proper and effective mechanism for distribution of resources under the scheme so that all the foodgrains and items of dry kit, which were purchased at the market price using public fund but were yet to be distributed among the non-PDS strata, were not wasted. In its petition filed through Prashant Rawat & Associates, the NGO alleged that Delhi government “purchased the items in bulk without having any rational data and analysis” and, thus, “substantial part of the goods purchased under the scheme are still lying at different places in Delhi and are getting spoiled/wasted day-by-day”. It added that Delhi government purchased the items without verifying the expiry dates and/or purchased the items which are about to get expire. Further hearing in the matter will take place on August 23. PTI||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-stand-of-centre-delhi-on-grain-wastage/articleshow/84252219.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||FIR in fake favipiravir racket||AHMEDABAD: A complaint of attempt to culpable homicide was filed against Sudip Mukherjee, owner of Max Relief Healthcare, for his alleged involvement in a multi-state fake favipiravir racket. The firm showed its registered address at Solan in Himachal Pradesh, but no firm by that name was found. Mukherjee through his accomplices provided fake medicines to a firm named Aarmed Formulation in Prahladnagar. An FDCA team found a stock of 133 strips of Favimax 200 and Favimax 400 tablets in the Aarmed office but an analysis revealed there was no favipiravir in those tablets. The FIR mentions that Mukherjee supplied the fake medicine despite knowing that it may prove fatal to Covid patients. He was booked for attempt to culpable homicide along with other charges. An inquiry by Food and Drugs Administration revealed that Mukherjee was selling drugs to wholesalers in the state without licence to do so. All states were alerted to stop using this drug. On May 30, Mukherjee, appeared before FDA but carried no documents linked to production and sale of drugs. At first glance, the photocopy of a licence that he produced appeared fake. He was handed over to Samta Nagar police station in Mumbai where an FIR was registered and he was arrested on June 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fir-in-fake-favipiravir-racket/articleshow/84217703.cms||---
---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Synagogue restoration work to resume||KOCHI: A high-level meeting held in Kochi on Wednesday decided to expedite the restoration of Kadavumbhagam synagogue at Mattancherry. Local residents, who had objected the takeover of the monument by the archaeology department, have also pledged their support for the protection of the synagogue. Officials allayed the apprehensions of the residents that there would be a construction ban in 300m surrounding the synagogue. The meeting was convened by additional chief secretary and tourism secretary V Venu and attended Kochi mayor M Anil Kumar and top officials. The officials assured that there won’t be any construction ban. “Additional chief secretary has given the assurance that there won’t be any restriction on construction near the synagogue even if it is declared as a monument by the state archaeology department. So, we are ready to give all the support for the protection of the synagogue,” said corporation health standing committee chairman T K Asharaf. He had been opposing the government move to take over the synagogue. “If there isn’t any construction ban, the project will help boost the development of Mattancherry, especially the tourism sector in the area,” Asharaf said. Officials with the archaeology department said that they would resume the works to stabilize the structure of the synagogue soon. “We had to stop the works to stabilize the structure of the synagogue due to objections from some of local residents and also from the Kochi corporation. As all such objections have been subsided, we will be able to resume the work without much delay,” an official with the archaeology department said. “The contractor who undertook the works to stabilize the structure of the synagogue had completed the work on the roof. Though they had started the works in October 2020, they had to stop it due to protests. Now, they will have to erect the roof. The roof will be erected in such a manner that it wouldn’t affect the structure of the synagogue in any way. The roof will not come into contact with the structure. The roof will protect the synagogue from getting damaged in the rains,” the official said. “Once the stabilization work gets over, top officials with the department will convene a meeting with all the stakeholders like members of the Jewish community, historians and heritage conservationists to discuss the future plans. Issues like restoration of the synagogue structure and setting up of a heritage hub will be discussed,” the official said. The officials and people’s representatives visited the synagogue. “We also visited the Ariyittuvazcha Kovilakam, which is another monument in the area. It had been remaining closed for quite some time. The officials with the archaeology department assured that the monument will be opened for the public once the restrictions as part of Covid control are lifted,” Asharaf said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/synagogue-restoration-work-to-resume/articleshow/84215057.cms||---
---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Common learning centres to bridge digital divide||KOCHI: The district education department has launched 36 common learning centres (CLCs) in Kothamangalam taluk to cater to the needs of students who have no access to online education. The centres, which would act as a common space for students in a particular locality, have been launched by the department in association with Samagra Shiksha Kerala (SSK) and scheduled tribes development department (STDD). CLCs, also known are neighbourhood learning centres, were set up with the aim of providing an alternative solution to those students, mostly tribal students, who do not have the facilities to attend the digital classes telecasted in Victers channel and the continuous learning sessions provided online by their respective teachers. Most of the centres are located in the building of libraries, anganwadis, tribal learning centres, cultural centres or cluster resource centres in respective areas. All these centres were launched in Kothamangalam taluk as most of the tribal colonies are located there. Detailed guidelines have been issued for the functioning of the centres on Thursday. However, high Covid test positivity rate (TPR) in Kothamangalam region, especially in Kuttampuzha panchayat, remain a challenge for the functioning of such centres. “As per the guidelines, the centres should have facilities like electricity, television, DTH/cable services, laptops, internet connectivity, toilets, drinking water, sanitization service etc. As students have to be physically present, strict Covid protocols are to be followed. The centres must be within walkable distance from the houses of students. The headmaster of nearby school will be in charge of coordinating the functioning of each centre. Deputy director of education (DDE), with the help of district education officer and block project coordinator, will be monitoring all centres,” said Ernakulam DDE Honey Alexander. The STDD have to coordinate with SSK and respective civic bodies to ensure that those tribal students, who reside not within walkable distance from the CLC, could reach the centre to avail the classes. If issues of unavailability of cable/DTH facility in the CLCs in tribal areas are there, the teachers would have to provide recorded video files of the classes in pen drives. If any student is absent, officials will have to collect his/her details and look at alternative options to make them attend the classes. “Around 24 centres have already started functioning but in some places, where the TPR is high, we have to wait for some more time to allow students to come. The remaining 12 centres will be opened later,” Alexander said. A helpdesk must be set up at the block resource centre (BRC) level to ensure the smooth functioning of the centres. A council headed by the DDE will have to submit a report after monitoring the functioning of the centres to the general education director every two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/common-learning-centres-to-bridge-digital-divide/articleshow/84215103.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: No admission test for UG course entry||KOLKATA: The state government has decided that there will be no admission tests for admissions to undergraduate courses in universities and students will be admitted based on their marks in board exams, higher education minister Bratya Basu said in a meeting with the vice-chancellors of state universities on Wednesday. Even interviews have been barred. All colleges have also been asked to rationalize their seats. Last year, as many as 110 colleges across Bengal had 50% of seats vacant. University VCs have been told to hold virtual meetings with all principals and inspectors of colleges to take a call on rationalisation of seats. Universities have also been told to start inviting applications as soon as the boards publish the results so that the first semester could begin by October 1. Like last year, the students will not be required to pay any application fees. Universities have also been asked to conduct online exams and publish results at the earliest. State universities that held entrance tests are in a fix following the announcement. Even those universities and colleges that do not usually hold entrance tests were keen on some sort of admission test this year to screen students after the different boards councils — both state and national — cancelled their Class XII exams. “The government has made a decision. We will now wait for advice from the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examinations Board that conducts the entrance exam,” said Presidency VC Anuradha Lohia. The university had scheduled admission tests in August. Sources said the WBJEE chairman was asked by higher education officials on how the decision to take the Presidency University Bachelor’s Degree Entrance Test (PUBDET) and the PG entrance tests were announced despite the state government’s advisory to scrap all entrance tests other than WBJEE. Jadavpur University registrar Snehamanju Basu said the admission committee of respective faculties would meet and take a call on the admission criteria for the UG programmes after VC informs the university officials of the state government's decision. St Xavier’s University is going ahead with the tests. “The government’s decision is for state-run universities. We are going ahead with our admissions on the scheduled dates,” said VC Fr Felix Raj. Another key decision taken at Wednesday’s meeting was to adopt women study centres (WSC) that no longer receive UGC funds. The VCs were told to submit information on WSCs to begin the adoption process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-admission-test-for-ug-course-entry-state/articleshow/84229514.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Bhupendra Yadav fourth Rajasthan MP to get berth in PM Narendra Modi ministry||JAIPUR: Rajasthan’s representation in the central government improved on Wednesday with the inclusion of Bhupendra Yadav, a Rajya Sabha member from the state, who was made minister of environment, forest and climate change in the Narendra Modi cabinet. The 52-year-old two-time member of the Rajya Sabha (2012 and 2018) is known for his organisational skills and his role as a crisis manager. He becomes the fourth MP from the state to secure a berth in Modi’s team. Other three include Gajendra Singh Shekhawat (Union Jal Shakti ministry), Arjun Ram Meghwal (minister of state for heavy industries and public enterprises) and Kailash Choudhary (minister of state for agriculture and family welfare). Born and brought up in Ajmer, Yadav entered national politics in 2010. Then national president Nitin Gadkari had appointed him as the party’s national secretary. He was known for his contribution in the field of law for the party. Yadav had extensively worked with BJP leader late Arun Jaitely in the Supreme Court, who introduced him to senior leaders. His fortunes changed forever with his nomination to the Rajya Sabha in 2012 from Rajasthan. The shift in his career from a legal luminary to an election strategist came after his active role in the Rajasthan assembly polls in 2013. From framing campaign strategy to designing a format for the selection of candidates, Yadav showcased his election management skills for the first leaving the central party leaders impressed. Thereafter, he has been actively working in the party at the central level. He was assigned the task of election in-charge of Gujarat assembly polls in 2017, Bihar assembly elections and Hyderabad municipal polls in 2020. He was also in-charge of the state party-affairs in Rajasthan during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when the saffron party had recorded a historic win here. Vasundhara Raje, Satish Poonia congratulate the new Union minister:BJP state president Satish Poonia said the inclusion of Bhupendra Yadav into the cabinet is a matter of pride for the state. “It will give wings to the development of the state,” said Poonia.

The permission of the state government had to be obtained repeatedly for providing relaxation in upper age limit to candidates in case of non-recruitment every year. The cabinet has given its approval to amend the Rajasthan Technical Education Subordinate Services Rules, 1973 for the employees of Government Polytechnic Colleges.

The news has already riled many in Ahmedabad city who were making a beeline for their second Covid dose. On Wednesday, however, the least number of vaccination centres — one government and 18 private paid vaccination centres — administered a total of 1,350 doses in Ahmedabad city. This is by far the least since the 18 to 44 year vaccination drive was launched by the state government. The government is yet to explain officially why the vaccination is suspended for the two days. The state government had suspended the anti-coronavirus vaccination on Wednesday due to ‘Mamata Diwas’, a day observed as part of the ongoing universal immunization program for pregnant women, additional chief secretary (health) Manoj Aggarwal had claimed earlier. On Tuesday 32,999 vaccines were administered within Ahmdabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) jurisdiction after which all the three day buffer stock was expended. “A large vaccine stock is to arrive on Friday and then in the days onwards there will be regular stock,” claimed a senior AMC official. In all across the state some 6,352 vaccines were administered across 88 centres. So far 2.73 crore Covid vaccine doses have been administered in Gujarat, including 2.17 lakh on Tuesday. The highest vaccination numbers were achieved on June 21 when the state government had claimed that 4.31 lakh vax shots were administered on a single day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-vax-jabs-for-gujarat-on-thu-fri/articleshow/84217679.cms||---

If the government wants, they can arrest me.” Sharma said that their association tried to give online education to students but as most students do not have good internet or gadgets, they cannot attend classes.

Maken had held discussions with Gehlot on Tuesday night as well, on his arrival here. Sources indicated that the discussion was mainly centred around appointment of district and block presidents of the party. These party appointments will be made by the end of this month. The party district and block presidents were removed after the rebellion by the then state president Sachin Pilot in July last year. Sachin was replaced by Govind Singh Dotasra but no fresh appointments were made at the district and block level. The indication is that the party appointments will precede the changes in the council of ministers. A reshuffle in the council of ministers is also due as there were nine vacancies in the ministry after the ministers loyal to Pilot were also removed last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/maken-meets-cm-again-before-leaving-for-delhi/articleshow/84217609.cms||---

From June 7 to 13, it was 11%, it dipped to 0.5% in the next week (June 14-20) and further went down to 0.27% between June 21-27. In 11 districts—Tonk, Sawai Madhopur, Rajsamand, Karauli, Jaipur, Dausa, Churu, Bundi, Bharatpur, Barmer and Baran, the positivity rate has marginally increased. While Rajsamand is the only district where the positivity rate is higher than 1% (it was 0.5% between June 21-27) and it rose to 1.33% (between June 28-July 3). Banswara and Jalore have the lowest positivity rate of 0%. ‘A large number of people have got vaccinated. Also most of the people have already been infected in the first and second waves and the lockdown and other measures taken by the government, have all contributed in slowing down the pace of Covid infection leading to the positivity rate going down significantly. Still, those who are not vaccinated and have not been infected yet are more susceptible to Covid infection,” said Dr S K Singh, senior professor (microbiology), SMS medical college. In some districts, the weekly positivity rate has increased slightly but overall, the positivity rate across the state stands at just 0.22% and it has been going down for over the past few weeks. Health experts believe that the epidemic associated with virus disease emerges and re-emerges. “The virus continues to mutate and it develops new variants. Sometimes, the virus becomes more infectious after mutation, while other variants remain less infectious. Also, the epidemic emerges and re-emerges in cycles. It is because of the cycles, it is believed that the third wave may emerge. The positivity rate might have gone down as large number of people have already been infected in the second wave and completing its cycle. Also, a large number of people have developed immunity after getting infected,” said a senior health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/weekly-covid-positivity-rate-goes-down-to-0-22-in-state/articleshow/84217613.cms||---

Out of it emerged the master actor Dilip Kumar who immortalised melancholy on screen. Dilip Kumar paced his way up to Adoor and greeted him: “Hello I am Dilip Kumar, you may not know me”. Adoor was stunned for a while but soon replied: “No, no, that is not right. Who doesn’t know you?” Dilip Kumar smiled and they had a hearty laugh and a casual chat. Memories of that brief meeting are still fresh in the mind of Adoor. “He came across as such a simple person. He was so humble. He just introduced himself with an innocence that was striking,” says Adoor. Adoor says he was blown away by the film Madhumati directed by Bimal Roy and it wasn’t just the film but the actor Dilip Kumar that made a lasting impression. “I was so impressed by the film Madhumathi. Dilip Kumar was the hero and I liked him a lot. There was something really subtle about his performance in that movie. Although I don’t prefer songs in movies, this was one film where I thought songs fitted the narrative perfectly,” says Adoor. Adoor says that Dilip Kumar was a subtle performer and was a master at underplaying the characters. “That was the beauty of his acting. He would not look like he was acting, it was just like being the character,” says Adoor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/adoor-dilip-kumar-a-subtle-performer/articleshow/84215129.cms||---

Even the street lamps had to be switched on at many places by 2.40pm. The cloud mass floated into the city from Bangladesh, leading to a sudden and premature onset of evening darkness. Weathermen explained that the cloud was so thick that it managed to cut out even the faintest rays of the sun, leading to almost complete darkness. A torrential rain and frequent lightnings followed the clouds. Kolkata received 97.1mm rain between 8.30am and 5.30 pm on Wednesday. The cloud mass of this density and height had not passed through the city in a long time, said weathermen. It had been triggered by the monsoon trough that now passes between Uttar Pradesh and north Bay of Bengal, cutting across Bengal and Bangladesh. “This gigantic cloud mass had floated in from Bangladesh and it travelled across North and South 24 Parganas into Kolkata. While parts of south Kolkata were affected, north, east and central Kolkata bore the brunt of the thunderstorm and the rain that it triggered,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. The inclement weather forced the diversion of four flights that were coming in to land at Kolkata. IndiGo flights from Bengaluru, Chennai, Patna and Dibrugarh were all diverted to Bhubaneswar. At some places in central and north Kolkata, the rain was so heavy and visibility so poor that traffic came to a crawl. “Despite using wipers, visibility was almost nil. I decided to park my car and waited almost 40 minutes for the rain to stop,” said Jaydip Ray, who had been driving to his workplace in central Kolkata For an hour between 2.30pm and 3.30 pm, the torrential downpour reduced visibility and made the condition treacherous to maintain operations. Initially though, it was north Kolkata that appeared to be bearing the brunt with localities like Ultadanga, Maniktala, Belgachhia and Beliaghata areas recording over 50mm rainfall between 2pm and 3pm that led to waterlogging. Later in the afternoon, Ballygunge, Jodhpur Park, Mominpur, Kalight and Behala, too, received heavy showers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/darkness-at-3pm-as-12km-tall-cloud-mass-pummels-kolkata-with-100mm-of-rain/articleshow/84215128.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Garden Reach woman tied up & gang-raped at home, robbed||KOLKATA: A 26-year-old woman was allegedly raped by three men who barged into her house on Tuesday afternoon. The victim was alone at her first-floor flat in a four-storey building at Paharpur in Garden Reach. Before fleeing, the accused ransacked the house and made away with Rs 15 lakh in cash and gold and silver ornaments. Cops said three miscreants had barged into the flat after breaking open the main door and they overpowered the woman. Her parents had gone to their garment factory. The couple locked her in the apartment while going out. Cops refused to comment on why they did so. Neighbours claimed that her parents had told them that they locked her up for her security. The woman was found tied up in her bedroom. The miscreants had forced open the almirah in the adjoining room and took away the money and the ornaments, said a police officer. The investigation has now been taken over by the detective department after top cops from Port division and Lalbazar rushed to her residence. Prima facie, cops have said that the woman was raped. “We have registered a case under IPC sections 376 D (gang rape), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), 450 (house trespassing) and 455 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint). We are investigating the case. Given the sensitivity of this case, the detective department will probe,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. “Our forensic experts and scientific wing officers from the detective department visited the location on Wednesday morning. Our probe is on and a medical examination of the complainant is being conducted,” another officer said. Sources said the woman had confided in her parents about the incident and the cops at Garden Reach police station were informed about it in the evening. Cops have started talking to neighbours in the neighbourhood. Apart from going through the calls that were made from the area, cops have also collected the CCTV footage for investigation. “We are providing all psychological assistance to the victim. We will pray to the court to record her statement once she recovers,” said an officer. “It is suspected that someone, who knew the victim or studied the daily routine of the family, might be involved in the incident,” the officer added.  Cops said the probe will also ascertain why there is such huge amount of cash and jewellery in the house and the possible list of people who were aware of this. “We hope to develop the leads in the next 24 hours,” said an officer at Lalbazar.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Incentive for informers to check female foeticide hiked||JAIPUR: The state government has increased the incentive under the ‘Mukhbir Yojana’ (informer scheme) with an aim to preventing female foeticide. The increased incentive of Rs 3 lakh, up from Rs 2.5 lakh, will be effective from the financial year 2021-22. Under the scheme, a person provides information of doctors or others involved in sex determination. The PCPNDT cell then verifies the information and conducts decoy operations to nab the guilty. Principal secretary (health) Akhil Arora has issued detailed guidelines regarding the scheme. In the guidelines, special emphasis has been laid to prevent sex determination by strict implementation of the PCPNDT Act. Earlier, informers were getting Rs 2.5 lakh in three installments. The first installment was given on successful completion of decoy operation, the second after complaint was filed in the court and the third after verdict by the court. Now, making it more attractive for the informer, decoy pregnant woman and her accomplice will be paid a total of Rs 3 lakh. The first installment will be given to the informer, decoy pregnant woman and her accomplice on completion of the decoy operation and the second will be paid after statement is given in support of the prosecution in the court. The pregnant woman, who will act as a ‘decoy’ will get Rs 1.50 lakh in two installments, earlier she was getting Rs1 lakh. Since the role of pregnant woman is crucial in the decoy operation, and risk of foetus is involved in it, the incentives has been increased for her, which she will get in two installments. Earlier, she was getting it in three installments. Earlier, the informer was given Rs 33,250 each in three installments and accomplice was given Rs 16,625 each in three installments. But now the informer will get the incentive in two installments of Rs 50,000 each and accomplice will get two installments of Rs 25,000 each. The pregnant women will get Rs 1.50 lakh. State Appropriate Authority (pre-conception pre-natal diagnostic technique Act) Sudhir Sharma said there will be more support from people in preventing sex determination with the implementation of informer scheme with slight modification in incentives. He appealed to the people to extend help in preventing sex determination and to lodge complaint about it on toll free number 104/108 and on whatsapp number 9799997795.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/incentive-for-informers-to-check-female-foeticide-increased/articleshow/84217631.cms||---

It was on August 28, 1968, Dilip Kumar and wife Saira Banu arrived here to inaugurate Anand Theatre, the first air conditioned theatre in Kottayam. The theatre was owned by the late George Mathew Maliakal who also owned the Central Pictures, a major film production and distribution company. His son Alex George recollects meeting Dilip Kumar as an 11-year-old boy. “He was a humble and down-to-earth person,” says Alex. Also present were another Bollywood superstar Sanjay Khan and Prem Nazir. “Barricades were placed along the road to the theatre. The crowd was so large that the compound wall of the KSRTC bus stand collapsed when Dilip Kumar passed by,” recollects Alex. After having lunch at the government guest house at Nattakom, Dilip Kumar reached the theatre at 2pm. After the function, the couple left to stay at the Lake Palace resort, Thekkadi for two days. Alex remembers visiting the couple with his entire family at Hotel Sealord in Kochi before they returned to Mumbai. Chitra Krishnankutty who owns the iconic Chitra Studio here, had just begun his photography career at the time of the inauguration. “I took the photographs of the event and also the lunch at the guest house. The event was an important one in my career,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/when-a-compound-wall-collapsed/articleshow/84215183.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

At his behest, Ibrahim once again sung the song and the veteran actor gave him a big clap and got onto the stage to congratulate him. A few days later, Dilip Kumar asked Ibrahim to meet him in Mumbai. “Dilip Sir introduced me to noted composers like R D Burman and Laxmikant-Pyarelal. Then, I got an opportunity to sing in ‘Atma Raksha’, a movie directed by Arjun Chopra and produced by Mohammed Bhai. “The song was recorded in the Mehboob studio. However, the film starring Vijendra and Zarina Wahab was not released and song ‘Jho Bhi Thumpe’ failed to reach the masses,” recalls Ibrahim. “Before going to the studio, Dilip Sir asked me whether I had food. When I replied in the negative, he ordered chicken biryani from the Sheraton Hotel where we stayed. He even served me some biryani rice. Then, his wife Saira Banu, standing beside him, mocked him asking whether he was acting. I was so excited that I couldn’t eat,” Ibrahim said. “He was such a loving person,” he said. Though the actor asked him to stay back in Mumbai, Ibrahim had to return due to financial crunches. “A few months later, he called up and asked me to sing at a wedding party in Hyderabad. He sent me the flight tickets. At that time also, he asked me to come to Mumbai,” Ibrahim said. Ibrahim couldn’t go to Mumbai as he couldn’t afford the accommodation cost there. Later, Ibrahim joined Kalabhavan in Kochi, but never again got a chance to sing in movies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/he-served-me-biryani-i-was-too-excited/articleshow/84215158.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Test charge cap only for ‘cash patients’||KOLKATA: The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) on Wednesday clarified that charges it had capped on certain diagnostic tests for private hospitals are meant only for “cash patients” and not for patients covered by health insurance schemes. “The order on capped charges for diagnostic tests is applicable to cash patients,” said commission chairperson Ashim Kumar Banerjee. He added hospitals will have to waive off a proportionate amount of the diagnostic tests on the sum a patient has to pay in cash as insurance companies do not pay the entire bill amount. Hospitals rued that this has brought further confusion and ambiguity. “Diagnostic tests are already covered by insurance companies and hospitals offer this at a discounted rate to these companies. Now on what basis hospitals will calculate the discount cash patients have to pay on inadmissible charges of which consumables are a large part it? This is creating further confusion,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. “We have already written to the commission and we are waiting for a response,” said AHEI president Rupak Barua. Private hospitals said that they will not introduce the capped charges till they get more clarification from the health commission. Hospitals felt that they should have been taken into a discussion before the rates were fixed as many said their quality control measures, advanced equipment, manpower and maintenance costs are higher than stand-alone labs and non-NABH accredited hospitals. “The diagnostic test charges in hospitals having less than 150 beds are already low. Hence, we have fixed the charges for hospitals with more than 150 beds,” said the commission chairperson. The health commission on Wednesday also asked a private hospital in Durgapur and a nursing home in Kolkata to refund part of amount billed to two different Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/test-charge-cap-only-for-cash-patients/articleshow/84215153.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Instead, officials said ward coordinators need to compile names of those unable to visit vaccination centres on grounds of health and arrange jab venues near their homes. Instead, ward coordinators can get people, in multiples of 10, vaccinated at a chosen venue located near a cluster of homes. Each vaccine vial contains 10 doses and health officials are keen that all are used at one site to prevent wastage. The demand for vaccination at home has been soaring after a KMC team responded to an appeal by a section of elderly and infirm people who can’t visit vaccination centres. “Today, we got several calls from senior citizens from different parts of the city who want KMC to send vaccinators to their homes. We have heard them, but also expressed our inability to do so given infrastructure problems and shortage of vaccines. We may, at best, arrange camps at a venue closer to their homes. The ward coordinators may take an initiative to prepare a list of such people and arrange sites at the ward level,” an official said on Wednesday. A KMC official said efforts could be made by ward coordinators to tie up with clubs or social organizations so that getting a venue becomes easier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/home-jab-drive-a-difficult-job-kmc/articleshow/84215181.cms||Saikat Ray

He had also claimed that he was part of the Indian delegation attending the BRICS summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2018, according to the police. The Baranagar resident who reportedly practised at the Calcutta High Court and Supreme Court had shared a photograph of him addressing a BRICS platform. Chaudhuri told investigators that he was at the Johannesburg summit that was also attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Chaudhuri also claimed that he part of another high level Indian delegation to Tokyo in 2013. The southeast division police said they have taken his passport to check his claims. “We are writing to the external affairs ministry and the home ministry for clarifications. We are also asking for some clarifications from the state home department. A separate letter will be sent to the CBI too,” said an officer. Police sources said Chaudhuri had even fought an election from Dum Dum constituency in 2009. He was a candidate of Ram Vilas Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party but lost the election. Cops said that a second investigation will concentrate on whether Chaudhuri had used forged documents to intimidate the complainant in the Gariahat property case. “A separate probe is on to check if forged signatures were used. His accomplice, who was introduced as the promoter, will also be probed,” said an officer. Chaudhuri’s lawyer Tirthankar Roy has challenged the state’s claims and said tthat hey are flimsy allegations without documentary evidence beyond what’s written in social media. “A property related civil case is being turned into a criminal one. We have confidence in the judiciary,” said Roy. Cops alleged that the accused had tried to “illegally” capture a costly property in the Gariahat area. Chaudhuri was arrested after being intercepted at the Amherst Street area on Sunday. His car, in which he roamed around, allegedly had a blue beacon and a fake CBI logo on it. The car was recovered from the Sinthee area.

I will reply to the show-cause notice as I did nothing against the party.” Joshi had shown support to the farmers’ agitation by saying they have to contest the elections in Punjab and they cannot ignore the voice of the people of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/anti-party-activities-bjp-district-vice-prez-gets-notice/articleshow/84212939.cms||---
---||Delhi||Petrol crosses Rs 100-mark: Angst and despair among Delhiites||NEW DELHI: From filling a full tank earlier to now refuelling only for the immediate need, people have ways of coping with the rising petrol price, which breached the Rs-100 mark on Wednesday. While some commuters said they now think twice before taking out their car, others now carefully consider the distance they need to travel and the amount they need to spend on fuel. “The government needs to think about the common man, many of whom have lost jobs during the lockdown,” said Vicky, who bought a litre of petrol for his two-wheeler because he couldn’t afford more having lost his job recently. TOI visited six petrol pumps in central, Lutyens’ and south Delhi to understand how the common man was coping with the unprecedented prices. At Delhi Gate, Afzal Ansari came to fill fuel worth Rs 500 and said, “I had two cars but had to sell one because it was no longer affordable to run both. The ever-rising fuel prices does not give us the pleasure of having two vehicles at home. It’s after a month that I took out the car today because we can’t drive it as much as we used to.” Ansari has a business in fabrics and finds it difficult to carry his wares in the Delhi Metro and feels the need for a car when travelling. Lecturer Sarvesh Pandey drives to the petrol pump only when the car shows the fuel falling to the reserve level. “We take online classes, true, but we also have to report to work as part of the 50% staff allowed to work physically from the institution,” said Pandey. Chartered accountant Mohit, 26, too fills his tank only when required. At CP, he said “Gone are the days when one could fill the tank to the full. Now we wonder, is it even affordable to do this?” Sales executive Jatin also worries about having to spend Rs 200 on petrol daily. “Whether we get food or not is secondary, but first we have to keep money aside for fuel,” said Jatin. It’s not just the commuters and common man who are facing the brunt of the price hike. Ironically, even petrol pump employees are hit hard by the rise in petrol cost. “We have odd timings and come to work sometimes early in the morning, sometimes late at night, so public transport doesn’t work for us. This means, every day we now have to keep Rs 100 aside for fuel,” said Sunil Yadav, a worker at a petrol pump.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/petrol100-fuels-angst-and-despair/articleshow/84217729.cms||---

Eleven Covid patients admitted in the hospital located inside Dreams Mall in Bhandup had died in the fire on March 25. The duo was booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, a charge that attracts a maximum of 10 years in jail. They were additionally accused of forgery, the maximum sentence for which is life imprisonment. “So far as false documents are concerned, those documents were submitted to the public authority and collected by the investigating officer. Therefore, considering the facts and circumstances of the present case…, I am inclined to allow the bail applications,” judge RM Sadrani said. The prosecution opposed the bail pleas alleging Joshi was the authorised person to issue necessary certificate. However, advocates Niranjan Mundargi and Keral Mehta for Joshi argued that only Sunrise Hospital had engaged Joshi for inspection and not Dreams Mall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-safety-inspector-ceo-of-bhandup-hosp-where-11-died-in-fire-get-bail/articleshow/84217715.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Ludhiana||Two held for setting on fire statue of Rajiv Gandhi in Ludhiana||LUDHIANA: The police arrested two men for setting on fire the statue of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi near Salem Tabri on Wednesday. Passersby and those working near the spot doused the fire. After learning about it, several Congress men gathered at the spot and got the statue painted. Once again, Congress’ Gursimran Singh Mand wiped the statue with his turban, stirring a controversy. In December 2018, some Akali leaders had smeared the statue with black paint and Mand had cleaned it with his turban. ADCP-1 Pragya Jain said, “Accused Ramandeep Singh Nihang and Satpal Singh Navi have been arrested. Both have a criminal background. Ramandeep has six FIRs against him and Satpal 17.” Condemning the incident, senior Congress leader Parminder Mehta said, “It is shameful. It is an insult of the entire country. We request police to register a sedition case against the culprits, so that such an incident does not occur again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/2-held-for-setting-on-fire-statue-of-rajiv-gandhi/articleshow/84212983.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Nostalgia rules as Kolkata remembers its five-decade-old ties with Sagina||KOLKATA: His friendship with Tapan Sinha was legendary. His respect for Chhabi Biswas, Pahari Sanyal, Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen is still talked about. His empathy for the 1978 flood victims of Bengal that had led him to captain a team of Bollywood actors in a charity cricket match at Eden Gardens in 1979 opposite Uttam Kumar’s team, where he scored 54, remains an example. His penchant for watching Mohun Bagan, East Bengal, and Mohammedan Sporting matches at the Rovers Cup and his love for Chuni Goswami are still cherished by football fans. These are few of the reasons why Dilip Kumar’s death marked the end of an era for his admirers in Bengal. In a tweet, chief minister Mamata Banerjee wrote: “Crestfallen at the passing of a beacon in cinema… His inimitable style of acting will remain engraved among film lovers for generations.” Thanks to his early association with Ashok Kumar, Bimal Roy and Nitin Bose, Kumar had developed a soft corner for the Bengali language. The quaint tracks in front of the railway workshop in Teendharia remind many of how India cinema’s ‘Tragedy King’ had shed his stardom to shoot there for Sinha’s ‘Sagina Mahato’ (1970), based on a story by Gour Kishore Ghosh. The Hindi version was remade with the same cast as ‘Sagina’ (1974). “Baba and he shared a deep intellectual friendship. He would read out translations of Tagore’s poetry to Yusuf bhai while he would recite Urdu shairi for him. He was the first choice for playing Sagina. Baba liked the fact that he could keep aside his stardom and get deeply into a character,” said Sinha’s son, Anindya, who was 10 years old when he accompanied the unit during the film’s shooting in Gayabari and Kurseong. So involved was Kumar that for one scene he suggested running after a speeding train in the rain. Sinha had wanted to use a body double but Kumar shot it himself and got it right in one take. Interestingly, Kumar had spotted actor Kader Khan during that shooting. He had requested Sinha to cast Khan in ‘Sagina’. Singer Anup Ghoshal recollects how Sinha had wanted Kumar to sing ‘Chhoti Si Panchhi’. “But Dilip Kumar loved my scratch and asked it to be retained,” Ghoshal remembered.  Kumar was first spotted in 1932 by Bengali actress Devika Rani. His debut in Amiya Chakravarty’s ‘Jwar Bhata’ (1944) also marked Ruma Guha Thakurta’s acting debut. Before shooting Nitin Bose’s adaptation of Tagore’s Naukadubi for ‘Milan’, Kumar read the novel’s translation. When he wrote the script of ‘Ganga Jamuma’, he got Bose to direct it. Later, he attended its premiere at Basusree. Bimal Roy’s ‘Devdas’ (1955) opposite Suchitra Sen remains a high point of his career. Then came Roy’s ‘Madhumati’ (1958) that was co-written by Ritwik Ghatak. Kolkata loved the way he dubbed for his Bengali film debut in Jaganath Chattopadhyay’s ‘Paari’ (1966). On Wednesday, photographs of Kumar with actors at Eden Gardens and his film premieres surfaced across timelines. Many fondly revisited Kumar’s Bengal connection that they wish to cherish forever.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nostalgia-rules-as-city-remembers-its-five-decade-old-ties-with-sagina/articleshow/84215230.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Nine days on, couple held for ‘gunpoint’ robbery||LUDHIANA: The police on Wednesday claimed to have arrested the couple who had robbed two men of Rs 1.50 lakh at gunpoint near Gill bridge nine days ago. The arrested are Harinder Singh and his wife Manjeet Kaur of Sidhwan Bet. They had been living in a rented accommodation in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar for the past some years. Additional deputy commissioner of police-II Jaskiranjit Singh Teja said “On June 28, the couple had robbed Ankush Kanda of Amritsar and his relative Babat Sharma of Rs 1.50 lakh at gunpoint. Ankush and Babat were waiting for a client to handover the payment. Rs 1.09 lakh of the robbed amount, a toy pistol and the SUV used in the crime have been recovered from the accused.”  The couple hatched the robbery plan after they saw some men making payment every day near Gill bridge. Harinder is already facing trial in cases of snatching and under the Arms Act. He was lodged in Mansa jail and came out on bail on December 20, 2018. After that he left Sidhwan Bet and started living in the city with his wife. During interrogation, the accused revealed that they also ran a flesh trade in two hotels of Pathankot and Himachal Pradesh. Ankush had come to the city to visit his relative Shivam Sachdeva. Shivam runs a forging unit and made payments to traders every day. That day, Shivam had asked Ankush and Babat to hand over the payment to a trader near the canal, where they were robbed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/9-days-on-couple-held-for-gunpoint-robbery/articleshow/84212954.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: With skeletons, insights tumble out of history’s cupboard from Vadnagar||AHMEDABAD: A set of skeletons and mortal remains – dating back 800 to 2,000 years – found from Vadnagar, PM Narendra Modi’s home town, gives a glimpse of ethnography of the region over the centuries and also customs like burial. Dr Niraj Rai, group head of the Ancient DNA Lab at Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences, carried out a detailed analysis on a skeleton found in seated posture, a bust of a woman and relics found from a stupa on Taranga Hill along with a few other skeletons found during the excavations at the ancient town. “The remains are about 800 years old. We matched the DNA samples with the known registry of Indian population and the closest match we have found is of Kashmiri Brahmins. He could also be a Nagar,” said Rai. One of the assumptions about the skeleton found from near government granary area is that it could be a case of living burial by a yogi, said sources close to the development. Another skeleton – whose only head and bust is found from Ghaskol locality of the town – is believed to date back to 1st to 4th Century CE. Dr Rai said that they found the analysis of the DNA of the woman very interesting as she shows a perfect match with the modern Gujarati population. “In a way, she represents the typical Gujarati population and was part of the genesis of today’s majority population of the region,” he said. He told TOI that the DNA analysis throws light on some interesting aspects of the population. “The analysis reveals that there is a continuity of the population – at least two groups are inhabiting the town for the past 2,000 years in some form. But there is also cultural assimilation as persons from different lineage making the town their home,” he said, adding that those associated with Buddhism were also from the local population, and not from outside the region. Two-day workshop concludes, gives direction for the experiential museum The two-day workshop on the excavation at Vadnagar organized by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) got concluded on Wednesday in presence of scholars from across India. The organizers said that the inter-disciplinary aspect of the ongoing work at the ancient town would give impetus to the understanding of the changes the town has experienced in the past two millennia. “Several new ideas have emerged from the discussions. As the town is soon getting an experiential museum, many concepts may get integrated in its design,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/with-skeletons-insights-tumble-out-of-historys-cupboard/articleshow/84217861.cms||Parth Shastri

Based on the complaint filed by the man, the Khultabad police have booked some villagers for voluntarily causing hurt, intentional insult to provoke breach of peace and criminal intimidation. Police station inspector Tukaram Mehetre said the offence is of non-cognizable nature, but no one has been arrested yet.  “The complainant is married and has children. He had eloped with a 30-year-old woman in January. Missing complaints were then filed with the police by their respective families,” he said. “A month later, the duo came to the police and stated that they wanted to live together. As a result, the missing complaints were closed and their families were informed. Due to opposition to their relationship and family pressure, the couple moved to Kannad and started living there,” he added. On July 2, when the man returned to o his village, some people from the woman’s family decided to teach him a lesson. A video of the entire incident was recorded by the villagers and posted on social media platforms. An officer privy to the probe said after the video was found in circulation, police contacted the man but he was under tremendous stress and trauma and refused to give an additional statement on the video. Sources said permission is being sought to add sections of the Information and Technology Act for the recording and uploading of video on social media. Adding this section will make the offence cognizable and non-bailable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-flogged-for-eloping-with-married-woman/articleshow/84217759.cms||Mohammed Akhef

With the price of petrol hitting Rs100 mark in the capital, Delhi Congress demanded a rollback of excise duty and VAT on fuel. Kumar claimed that the frequent fuel price hike did not seem to affect the BJP government at the Centre. “The central government is not concerned about the plight of the common people,” he said. Kumar added that the common people was financially distressed by the Covid-19 pandemic and were in no position to bear the extra burden of oil price hikes. “The party workers protested peacefully, in Gandhian style and with rose flowers in hand, but were stopped from advancing toward the residence of the petroleum minister.” Public transport in the capital, he alleged, was in a bad shape and ordinary people were facing extraordinary difficulties in their daily commute.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cong-protests-outside-petroleum-mins-house/articleshow/84217797.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks state to show if school fee regulatory authority is functional||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday asked the state to show the notification constituting a divisional authority and a grievance committee for school fees as well as their addresses. Last month, HC had directed the state education department to respond to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar for proper enforcement of and compliance to the School Fees Act, 2011. The state, in its reply on Wednesday, said the divisional fees regulatory committee had been constituted. Bhatkhalkar’s senior counsel Biren Saraf, though, submitted what is important is that the state affidavit says the logistics for functioning of the committee are being worked out. He said the committee was in any case set up a decade after the enactment of the law, requiring such a grievance redressal committee for aggrieved parents to go to. The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni remarked: “What is the use of constituting a committee if it is not functioning... It is already a month now.” The state’s affidavit filed by Sandeep Sangave, deputy director of education, Mumbai region, said, “After sorting out the administrative and logistical issue, these recently set up committees will start functioning at the earliest.” Such a committee has the power to handle any dispute between the school management and the parent-teachers’ association over the fees being charged. The HC bench asked the state lawyer to submit details on Thursday of the functioning of the committee, else it would mean that the department is setting up a committee without any teeth. The HC orally cautioned that if the state doesn’t act, it may be forced to call the joint secretary of the department himself. An intervention application was also filed on Wednesday by the Unaided Schools Forum whose counsel K J P Sen sought to know what the PIL sought and to be heard as well. On the PIL, the HC said, “You are seeking directions against schools without making them a party?’’ Saraf said it was not possible to make all schools a party but said private unaided schools may certainly be heard. The PIL also seeks interim orders to enable school fee payment in instalments and not to debar any student from either online or physical classes over fee arrears or non-payment or withhold their progress report. The HC will continue to hear the matter on Thursday now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-asks-state-to-show-if-school-fee-regulatory-authority-is-functional/articleshow/84217763.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Ahmedabad||A jolt from past: A 1,000-year-old Vadnagar earthquake||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat shares a long relationship with earthquakes due to its position on the seismic fault-lines. But that’s also the reason that this region’s residents, over the centuries, developed methods to counter the impact of the natural phenomenon, indicated findings from the Vadnagar excavation. Dr Siddharth Prizomwala, a scientist from the Institute of Seismological Research (ISR) on Wednesday presented his findings on the final day of a two-day workshop organized by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The study by experts from ISR, ASI, Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleosciences, and Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology has found a definite proof of a major earthquake at least 1,000 years ago in the town that is recorded in the sedimentary layers excavated by the team along with a fallen wall from the same period. Experts said that in majority of the cases, the impact of the earthquake is either assessed by impact of the event beneath the surface or the damage to the structures. They pointed at relatively loose soil in Vadnagar for the inference that it could be a massive one. The work is on to assess its magnitude. What does it say about the town? “The implication of the fault is that it showcases how past humans of Vadnagar coped and adjusted with earthquake as natural disaster and their resilience to such phenomena. The study led with integrated, geological, geophysical and archaeological experts will yield new insights and begin a new chapter in archeao-seismology of Gujarat,” said Prizomwala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vadnagar-occupants-coped-with-seismic-changes/articleshow/84217858.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Mumbai||‘His memory was fading, but he took no time to recognise me’||It’s hard to believe that Dilip Kumarji—Yusufsaab to all of us—is no more. He was to me like elder brother, a friend and guide. My first meeting with Yusufsaab was on a suburban train. This was years ago—I think, in 1946 or ’47. I, Anil-da (music director Anil Biswas) and one of his assistants were on our way to Malad. A tall, young man hopped into the co-mpartment at Bandra. Anil-da asked him to join us. ‘Yeh ladki kaun hai?” (Who is this girl?) he asked. Anil-da introduced me, saying, “This is a young pl-ayback singer, she is very go-od. She is a Maharashtrian.” Yusufsaab remarked jokingly, “Maharashtrians are hardly well-versed in Urdu. Their Urdu ‘talaffuz’ (pronunciation) smells of ‘daal-bhaat’.” That very day I asked (music director) Mohammad Shafisaab if he could look for an Urdu tutor for me. Today, when someone praises my Urdu ‘talaffuz’ I quietly thank Yusufsaab. His light-hearted remark made me study a beautiful language. Yusufsaab’s Urdu was impeccable, music to the ears. We would often bump into each other, and he would greet me with affection. Whenever I touched his feet, he would say, ‘Jeeti raho, khush raho (Live a long, happy life)’. I’ve seen most of Yusufsaab’s films—‘Deedar’, ‘Madhumati’, ‘Aan’, ‘Daag’, ‘Yahudi’, ‘Aadmi’...almost all—in cinema halls. I would go along with my sisters to Liberty, Roxy, Opera House to see films. Watching Yusufsaab on the silver screen was a fascinating experience. His sheer presence on celluloid was magnetic: a heady mix--grace, style, dignity and acting abilities; his faraway, brooding glances said it all. Yusufsaab sang with me in ‘Musafir’, a Hrishikesh Mukherjee film. It was Hrishi-da’s brainwave to ask Yusufsaab to sing a duet with me. Salil-da (music director) put him through the paces. Yusufsaab began in the true tradition of classical music—aalaap, taan and so forth. He sang to his heart’s content and then we recorded the song. And I must tell you that people liked ‘Laagi naahi chchute raam...’. Connoisseurs remember the song to this day. I had my first concert in London in 1974. I requested Yusufsaab if he would be there at the iconic Royal Albert auditorium to introduce me to the audience. He readily agreed. In his brilliant speech, he described me as his “little sister”. I used to tie a raakhi on his hand on Raksha Bandhan Day every year. Over the years Yusufsaab’s health began to deteriorate. I had a strong urge to meet him. My niece Rachana (Shah) accompanied me to his Pali Hill residence. This was in December 2014. Sairaji (Dilip Kumar’s wife) took me to Yusufsaab’s room. We all knew that his memory was fast fading. But, he hardly took any time to recognise me. He smiled and said, “Come in.” A big chair, saddled with a gadda, was me-ant for him; but he insisted on sitting on a sofa, next to me.

A BJP member since 1991, Bhowmik’s induction is a clear indication that BJP is preparing to retain the state it won for the first time in 2018, given that Chief Minister Biplab Deb is facing some dissent from within. TMC’s victory in Bengal and Mamata Banerjee’s attempt to revive the party’s fortunes in Tripura is seen as threat. Post its Bengal victory, TMC has aggressively started campaigning in Tripura, prompting BJP to ensure that its strength on the ground is not diluted. Bhowmik’s induction will strengthen BJP’s morale in the state while it also seen as underlining the Centre’s commitment to the small state. Bhowmik is the second woman from the Northeast to make it to the Union Council of Ministers after Bijaya Chakraborty of Assam who was a minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tripura-too-gets-a-slot-in-union-ministry/articleshow/84222211.cms||Mohua Chatterjee
---||Kolkata||Final duel: Football-crazy Kolkata split over Argentina and Brazil||KOLKATA: A mouth-watering fare awaits football fans this Sunday with two of the city’s favourite teams set to clash in the final of Copa America, stirring up a frenzy and splitting the city into two camps, with each rooting passionately for their favourite teams. As Brazil clashes with Argentina, it will be Messi magic versus Neymer’s brilliance on display and Kolkata couldn’t have hoped for a more exciting start to a Sunday — the match starts at 5.30 am — with the Euro final slated to be played later that night. The city usually splits into two whenever these sides meet, and this time will be no different. The social media is already abuzz and clubs — despite Covid and the odd hour of the match — have promised to make a spectacle out of it. Businessman Uttam Saha, founder of the Argentina Football Fans Club, promises to decorate his terrace with Argentina flags and have special cakes for breakfast. “It should be the perfect spot for a small party when Argentina lifts the Cup,” he said. Saha said, he would have loved to watch the match on a big screen at Ganguly Bagan, but the Covid restrictions will mean that he has to be careful. “I have a hall at home and a big television. Around 20 of us will watch the match early in the morning. Face masks and social distancing, though, will be essential,” he said. Saha hopes that this time Argentina is able to turn the tables on Brazil, who beat them in their last Copa duel in 2019. Chartered accountant Sayantan Majumdar — a die hard Brazil fan — has asked all his loyal friends to turn up at the Behala Navodaya club. They will be sporting the Brazil colours while watching the match. “There cannot be a bigger clash than this to welcome back football at its best,” he said. He plans to put up some Brazil flags in the neighbourhood hoping the rain Gods will have some mercy. “Brazil is a better unit and I am confident. I saw Argentina struggle in the semis and our coach Tete must have seen their weaknesses. I plan to celebrate with a few close friends at home after we win. Of course, I will need a little nap before I get ready for the euro finals at night,” said Majumdar. For him watching Messi win the Copa crown in Brazil will be the “ultimate nightmare”. While Brazil won the title 9 times, Argentina leads the race with 14. Facebook groups — Brazil Fans of Kolkata and Argentina Fans Club Kolkata — are inviting discussions on the strength and weaknesses of the teams. “You cannot love your team unless you discuss it threadbare,” said a supporter on a Brazil group. “We want a good Latin American duel. These are matches that we look up to create the magic,” said Nikhil Sacheva, a college student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/final-duel-football-crazy-kolkata-split-over-argentina-and-brazil/articleshow/84215418.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Nashik had its first Union minister way back in 1962 when Congress leader Yashwantrao Chavan became the defence minister after winning the 1962 Lok Sabha by-polls from Nashik. The seat had fallen vacant due to the demise of the local Congress MP Govid Deshpande. Pawar, a 42-year-old medical graduate from Nashik-based NDMVP Medical College, had quit NCP and won the Dindori parliamentary seat in the last Lok Sabha polls on a BJP ticket. Her father-in-law, Arjun Tulsiram Pawar, was one of the biggest names in political circles in Nashik and had been a legislator for eight terms on the trot. Former BJP state minister Girish Mahajan, who was instrumental in Pawar’s induction into the BJP, exuded confidence that she will be able to deliver as a Union minister. “She is suave and articulate. Our central leadership has made the right decision by inducting her into the Union ministry,” Mahajan added. Unlike in the first term of Modi when Subhash Bhamre, BJP MP from Dhule in north Maharashtra, was the minister, in the second term of the prime minister, there was no representation from the region in the central Cabinet. BJP leaders of north Maharashtra are of the view that Pawar’s induction as a Union minister will further consolidate party’s hold in north Maharashtra that has been a citadel of BJP. There are eight Lok Sabha constituencies in this region in the five districts and in the last Lok Sabha polls the BJP-Sena combine had fought together with the BJP winning six seats and Sena two. “But the political situation has now undergone change with BJP and Sena parting ways. Pawar’s induction in the Union ministry will send the right signal to the tribal and women voters who shape the destiny of the candidates in some of the Lok Sabha constituencies of the region. Moreover, Pawar has been on the forefront raising issues related to farmers of the region,” a senior state BJP leader said. Nashik city BJP leaders said the civic polls in Nashik is due early next year and with Pawar’s induction the central leadership of BJP has send a loud message to the voters about the importance it has given to Nashik, which will help the party in retaining power in Nashik Municipal Corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-gets-a-union-minister-after-59-yrs/articleshow/84217170.cms||---

The court directed police to probe the roles of the accused, complainant and portal “Binance” in the case. Complainant Hitesh Bhatia had said that he dealt in sale and purchases of Bitcoins.

The party mouthpiece Saamna, in an editorial, asked if the “governor’s supression” of 12 names that the Maha Vikas Aghadi government had recommended for the legislative council did not amount to “murder of democracy”. The state on Tuesday suspended 12 BJP legislators for a year for creating ruckus in the assembly over a discussion on the OBC quota issue. Devendra Fadnavis, opposition leader in the assembly, had called the action “murder of democracy” and threatened to move court. In response to the allegations, Shiv Sena raised questions over the 12 names recommended for the MLC post through the governor’s quota eight months ago as well as the suspension of 19 Congress-NCP MLAs in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shiv-sena-questions-supression-of-12-names-for-mlc-post/articleshow/84219936.cms||---

Speaking to the Times of India from Lahore, she recalled Dilip Kumar’s 1989 visit to Karachi with his wife, Saira Banu, and brother, Ahsan Khan, for a charity event to raise money for the patients of thalassaemia. She said: “He called my mother, Alys Faiz, to ask if he could come to our house in Lahore to do personal condolences for the demise of my father, although he had sent a message at Faiz Saab’s passing away in 1984. He requested to make it a private affair but the word got out and his admirers poured in from all over. Poet Qateel Shifai and our family doctor also queued up.” Faiz Ahmad Faiz’s daughter Salima Hashmi with Dilip Kumar and Saira Banu at her residence in LahoreHashmi recalled that: “Saira and he were very gracious.” His brother, Ahsan Khan, who accompanied them, passed away in September 2020. Hashmi said: “Later in Mumbai for shooting a documentary, I went to Dilip Kumar’s house with my daughter, where he not only told me about his favourite ghazal of my father, ‘Mauzu-e-Sukhan’, but also recited it for us on camera: ‘Gul huī jaatī hai afsurda sulagtī huī shaam, Dhul ke nilegī abhī chashma-e-mahtāb se raat; Aur mushtāq nigāhoñ kī sunī jāegī, Aur un hāthoñ se mas hoñge ye tarse hue haath. (The smouldering evening is being extinguished slowly, Soon the night will arrive bathed in the fountain of the moon, And the desire of my eyes will be fulfilled, And my thirsty hands will touch those hands).’” She said Pakistan had many more fond memories of the Peshawar-born Indian cinema legend, whom it regarded as its own and who would step across the border frequently. She said: “The Pakistanis loved his films and, many years ago, wanted to preserve his ancestral house.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/dilip-kumar-a-fan-of-faiz/articleshow/84217831.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Nagpur||Clean Nagpur still a distant dream||NAGPUR: Choked drainage chambers, overflowing sewage and heaps of garbage indicate something is not right with the sanitation system of a city that is pegged to be groomed into a Smart City. For the past many months, there has been rise in number of daily complaints to Nagpur Municipal Corporation regarding choked drains and overflowing sewage from across the city. Yet, NMC’s public health engineering department — responsible for maintenance of sewage disposal infrastructure — has failed to root out the problem. A case in point is the lane near J&K Bank behind Karachi Gali in Sadar. Both residents and shopkeepers are facing inconvenience due to sewage water overflowing onto the street for the last one year. Similar is the situation in many flat schemes near Shankar Nagar Square where residents quite often face health issues due to unhygienic conditions because of overflowing sewage. “We have made many complaints to NMC’s Dharampeth zone, but the problem is yet to be resolved,” claimed shopkeeper Memon Afaque Iqbal. Despite two private agencies — AG Environ and BVG India — collectively employing 2,000 workers for door-to-door waste collection, the situation on the ground has failed to improve. Rahul Agare, a resident, said private firm workers visit once a week to collect garbage in Anant Nagar. Tilak Nagar residents say garbage is collected twice a week forcing many to dump it alongside nullah or in it. “Municipal solid waste management, sewerage system and stormwater drainage is on the verge of collapse,” said founder and director of Centre For Sustainable Development Leena Buddhe. “Frequent instances of choked gutters even in posh localities are common, so one can only imagine the condition in slums. Civic authorities come up with temporary solutions of removing blockages, but there seems to be no master plan to mend the age-old sewerage system. One can see untreated sewage being drained into Nag, Pili and Pohra rivers flowing through the city,” she said. Moreover, plan to set up small sewerage treatment plants has not gained momentum. Citizens pay taxes and yet suffer due to inefficient and casual attitude of civic employees, who keep revising the plan to clean and rejuvenate Nag River while the Pili and Pohra also bear the brunt, said Buddhe. Buddhe said, “One fails to understand why it is required to privatize door-to-door collection and transportation of solid waste. Why can’t the civic body follow Indore Municipal Corporation, which has bagged cleanest city awards? Even NMC practised it till 2007. With regularization of all aiwajdar staff, why can’t the NMC use its own staff to manage the solid waste?” The city has already received huge funds to buy mechanical sweeping machines under National Clean Air Programme. After getting these machines, NMC can divert sanitary workers on door-to-door collection, said Buddhe. Crores of rupees are spent on collection and transportation of waste, but still no visible improvement. Citizens should also take the ownership of the city seriously and stop dumping waste along the roads or in nullahs. “One has to understand nexus between contractors and NMC. Who is benefiting? Are the citizens happy about this arrangement? When will the authorities start working for the city’s development and citizen’s welfare?” she asked. Ground Reality  200MT compost: Waste generated in city is transported to Bhandewadi dumping yard.

Kishan Reddy on Wednesday was elevated to the Union cabinet from minister of state for home affairs. Kishan Reddy was allotted culture and tourism portfolios. Thanking the Secunderabad parliament constituency voters, he said that he would try his best to work towards realising the dreams of Telangana along with serving the country. Though Bandaru Dattatreya was a minister in the NDA-1, he was not given cabinet rank. Interestingly, after Sudini Jaipal Reddy and Renuka Chowdary from Telangana, who were cabinet ministers in UPA-2, Kishan Reddy made it to the Union cabinet from the state after seven long years. He was earlier a three-time MLA and BJP floor leader in undivided Andhra Pradesh and Telangana assemblies. He also served as BJPs state president in the undivided state of AP and also Telangana. In due recognition of his unflinching commitment towards the party, he was appointed national president of the party’s youth wing, BJYM in 2002. Kishan Reddy undertook a 22-day Telangana ‘Poru Yatra’ — a 3,500-kilometre journey through 986 villages and 88 assembly constituencies stressing the need for formation of Telangana. Known to be close to vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu , Kishan Reddy is the second cabinet minister after Naidu in the BJP government from Telugu states. Congratulating Kishan Reddy on his elevation, BJP Telangana chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar said his was work was duly recognized. Known as “Kishananna” among party workers, Kishan Reddy hails from Rangareddy district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kishans-meteoric-rise-worker-to-1st-cabinet-min-from-t/articleshow/84221370.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

A member of its National Assembly proposed a joint award in the name of the late ‘Tragedy King’. As the news of the actor’s death arrived at Peshawar in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, his fans gathered outside his ancestral house for namaz-e-janaza (funeral prayer). Talking to TOI over telephone, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) digital media head Ikram Khatana said: “Our government has purchased the house for 72 lakh Pakistani rupeees to turn it into a public museum. The crumbling structure requires massive restoration, so it will take time. The Peshawarias, especially, wanted to preserve the house of the actor who had brought laurels to their city.” Pakistan’s Hindu MNA (member of National Assembly) Chand Malhi propsed a joint India-Pakistan cinema award named after Dilip Kumar, “the joint treasure of both countries”. “India Pakistan might not be on good terms but Dilip Kumar enjoyed respect in both countries,” said Malhi, who is also parliamentary secretary for human rights. Dilip Kumar died at 98 in Mumbai’s Hinduja Hospital on Wednesday morning. Islamabad’s National Press Club senior vice-president Sadia Kamal said: “Peshawar’s social activists led by Shakil Wahidullah gathered in front of his house for namaz-e-janaza. Dilip Kumar has fans on both sides of the border.” A thespian known for his tragic film roles, Dilip Kumar was born Yusuf Khan on December 11, 1922, in Mohalla Khudadad near Peshawar’s historical Qissa Khuwani Bazar. Sadia said: “The KPK directorate of archaeology and museums put up a flex sign in front of Dilip Kumar’s ancestral house to offer condolences to his family. It carries a picture of the late actor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/pak-cries-for-tragedy-king-peshawar-home-to-be-museum/articleshow/84217854.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Patna||JD(U) joins Modi govt for first time, 4 Cabinet ministers from Bihar now||PATNA: PM Narendra Modi inducted JD(U) national president Ram Chandra Prasad Singh alias RCP and LJP’s Pashupati Kumar Paras from Bihar as the Cabinet ministers and elevated minister of state (independent charge) Raj Kumar Singh from the BJP quota to the Cabinet rank in the reshuffle on Wednesday. Incidentally, JD(U) has joined the in Modi-led council of ministers at the Centre for the first time. RCP is a two-time Rajya Sabha member and his second term ends next year while Paras is the first-time Lok Sabha member from Hajipur. But the Union Cabinet rejig was preceded by dramatic developments, as Patna Sahib MP from BJP and law and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad was among the 12 Union ministers who resigned before the start of the oath ceremony. Following the reshuffle, the Union council of ministers has four cabinet ministers from Bihar – Giriraj Singh and Raj Kumar Singh from BJP, RCP from JD(U) and Pashupati Kumar Paras from LJP (Paras) and two ministers of state, Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Nityanand Rai from BJP. Earlier, only Prasad and Giriraj were the Cabinet ministers. Observers feel the war between the Twitter and the central government could be one of the reasons behind dropping Prasad from the Cabinet. Further, recently, the Supreme Court also noted that the section of the IT Act that it had rescinded was still being used to lodge cases. Incidentally, there was rumour on the day that even Choubey had submitted his resignation to the President. Choubey, a Brahmin, has been retained owing to the coming assembly elections in UP next year. Also, ignoring former Bihar deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi has also surprised many in political circles. On the other hand, the induction of RCP has left out Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh, who is the JD(U) parliamentary party leader in the Lok Sabha. Since JD(U) had been demanding representation in the Union council of ministers in proportion to its strength in the Lok Sabha, how it would pan out in the weeks to come will be keenly watched, observers felt.

---||Nagpur||Can’t let students in remote villages drop out of edu ecosystem: Min||Nagpur: The state education department on Wednesday issued a GR permitting schools in rural areas to reopen in physical mode from July 15 if they meet some very stringent criteria like entire village being Covid-19 free for a month. Apart from this, a committee headed by the sarpanch will also consider the school’s application for reopening based on other factors (see box). For city students whose school campuses are in rural areas, allowing entry on campus will be at the discretion of a special committee. Speaking exclusively to TOI, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “We have formed a committee at gram panchayat level that shall be headed by the sarpanch. The committee will include government officials (see box) as well and will consider multiple factors before taking a decision on reopening.” Gaikwad reiterated that the main purpose of allowing schools to reopen was to ensure that those in remote villages are not left out of the academic ecosystem. “There is a problem of internet connectivity and access to digital learning platforms in villages and that’s becoming a barrier for learning. The more students stay away from school and learning, the more are their chances for dropping out. We cannot let that happen and hence, every effort is being made to keep them connected with schools,” said Gaikwad. Though the state government initiated teaching projects through public broadcast platform too, students in back-of-the-beyond places were still left out. “In these small villages if there have been no Covid-19 cases, then reopening can be done,” said Gaikwad, who is also a qualified teacher. “Our effort is to bring kids in such villages back to school and learn in physical mode. We are urging district collectors to vaccinate teachers on a priority basis so that they are in a better position to take our ‘back to school’ mission forward,” said Gaikwad. Stressing on the need for safety, Gaikwad said the standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared with a lot of thought. “Even things like transportation of students has been looked at in detail. We would prefer parents dropping/picking kids because that would help them avoid the buses. And if they do use school bus, then strict instructions regarding sanitization have been given,” said Gaikwad. After closure of schools when the Covid-19 pandemic hit last year, Maharashtra government waited till November 23 to allow reopening of schools. As weeks passed, attendance figures across the state skyrocketed with daily attendance touching almost 50 lakh. Education officials said it is unlikely that any school would reopen on July 15 itself as a ‘lot of paperwork’ has to be done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cant-let-students-in-remote-villages-drop-out-of-edu-ecosystem-min/articleshow/84215530.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Calling for its conservation, archaeologists urged the state government to restore the temple. Built during the Kakatiya regime, the temple is a triple shrine that has a common ‘rangamandapa’, vernacularly called ‘Trikutalayam’. “There is a dire need to restore the missing portions of the triple shrine to its original style,” archaeologist E Siva Nagi Reddy said. The temple is located just 38 km from the district headquarters. Based on the style of architecture of the temple mouldings and art of Bhairava and Nandi sculptures seen in the rangamandapa, dwarapala and lady sculptures carved on the door frames, Nagi Reddy said the temple dates back to Kakatiya Ganapatideva’s period of 13th century AD. Locals worship the Sivalinga installed in the arthamandapa while the sanctum sanctorum is missing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/800-yr-old-kakatiya-temple-in-ruins/articleshow/84221377.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The Genco is generating hydel power from various power stations on Krishna river for the past 10 days, which has become a major controversy between Telangana and AP governments. Official sources said the state government has utilised about 260 million units (MU) hydel power for state requirements for lifting water from lift irrigation projects such as Kaleshwaram project, which was just 50 MU between April this year to July 7. Generally, hydel power generation starts in the middle of July or later based on the inflows from upstream areas. But the Telangana government decided to generate power from hydel station in view of state requirements especially for utilizing the power for lift irrigation projects. Statistics of TS Genco hydel power generation shows, this year 71 MU was generated in May, 32 MU in June and 161 MU in July. Last year in 2020-2021, 37 MU in May, Nil in June and 11 MU was generated in July. Highest power generation from the irrigation projects was 762 MU in September, 2020. Power generation started on June 29, and started generating hydel power from Srisailam, Nagarjuna Sagar, Jurala and Pulichintala. Due to dwindling inflows from up-streams of Krishna river, the power generation reduced in the past two days. Officials said power generation stopped completely from Jurala as the water levels dipped at the project due to poor inflows from upstream Karnataka state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/highest-hydel-power-generation-by-ts-genco-in-june-july/articleshow/84221368.cms||Koride Mahesh

No doing a hasty job, no rushing away and no going home for the night. In what is called ‘Palle Nidra’ programme, the sleep-over in the village is giving villagers the opportunity to interact with officials even if it means the discussions go on till late in the night. Agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy slept at a local temple in Achyuthapuram village in Wanaparthy district as he went to meet the villagers on July 5. While on his way to another village on July 6, the minister had to walk through a stream. Mahbubnagar collector S Venkat Rao spent the night at Chennagula Gadda Thanda in Balanagar mandal in the district on July 6 night.

Danam and the driver were also fined Rs 1,000 each. The court then granted them bail giving the duo time to appeal against the verdict. Nagender represents Khairatabad constituency in the assembly. It had all started in 2013 as a minor road rage incident. The complainant, Subba Rao, was driving his car and had suddenly applied brakes at a traffic signal. Some of Danam’s associates, who were travelling in a car behind Rao, got upset, got out of the car and picked up an argument on the road. Local policemen reached the spot and shifted both Subba Rao and Danam’s associates to the Banjara Hills police station. Danam, who was a state minister then, too reached the police station in support of his associates. According to the police, Danam had then instigated his driver, C Raju, to attack Rao in the police station leading to fisticuffs. “The court convicted both Danam and Raju under Section 323 of IPC for voluntarily causing hurt,” special public prosecutor G Narayana, told TOI. Danam is accused number 2 in this case. The same court, in the past, comnvicted Congress MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy, BJP MLA Raja Singh and some other politicians in various cases, but supended the sentence giving them time to appeal against the verdicts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mla-danam-gets-six-month-jail-in-2013-assault-case/articleshow/84221388.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra Navnirman Sena: Will cut water to civic chief’s home||AURANGABAD: Demanding regular water supply in the city, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) on Wednesday addressed a news conference and warned that if regular supply is not restored in 10 days, the party workers will uproot the water connection of the civic chief’s official bungalow. Office bearers maintained that despite making written representation to the Aurangabad municipal administrator Astik Kumar Pandey, they have failed to get any convincing response. MNS also questioned the logic of imposing equal water tax on the areas with a regular water supply and those that have an erratic supply schedule. Party’s district coordination Bipin Naik said: “If the AMC administrator does not ensure regular water supply (at least twice a week), and reverse the exorbitant water taxes, we will disconnect the administrator’s official bungalow’s water connection.” The officer-bearers maintained that earlier, the city used to get water daily. Then it got water once in two days, and gradually, the gap increased. In fact, some areas now get water supply once in eight days. Naik said that in 2011, when the contract was signed with the water utility company for laying a parallel pipeline, the tax was Rs 1,800. The contract had a condition that the water utility company would increase the tax by 10% each year. “This company did not start work till 2014, but water taxes were increased to Rs 2,500, Rs 2,750 and Rs 3,050 till 2014. And in 2015, it was became Rs 3,350. And now the tax is Rs 4,050,” said Naik. MNS office-bearers said civic bodies in Nashik and Pune that provide water daily supply to citizens, charge Rs 1,400 and Rs 1,250, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mns-will-cut-water-to-civic-chiefs-home/articleshow/84217908.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad sees 69% increase in key pollutant nitrogen dioxide in last one year||HYDERABAD: Hyderabad saw a substantial increase of 69% in the level of the key pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) between April 2020 and April 2021, a new report by Greenpeace India said on Wednesday. Greenpeace India made satellite observations in the eight most populous Indian cities to assess the NO2 levels over the past one year. The report has attributed the hike to city’s reliance on fossil fuels, including coal, oil and gas and due to increased economic activity once the lockdown was lifted last year. NO2 is a dangerous air pollutant and exposure to it severely impacts people’s lungs, blood circulatory systems and brain. The report titled ‘Behind the Smokescreen’ revealed that despite lockdown 2.0, NO2 levels in Hyderabad have increased significantly. The city recorded the fourth highest rise in NO2 pollution levels in eight state capitals, after Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai. In Delhi, NO2 was higher by 125%, Chennai by 94%, Mumbai by 52%, Bengaluru by 90 %, Kolkata by 11%, Jaipur by 47 % and Lucknow by 32 % “The air quality levels are alarming. Motor vehicles and industries based on fossil fuel consumption are major drivers of NO2 pollution. People saw clean skies and breathed fresh air during the nationwide lockdown though it was an unintended consequence of the pandemic. Recovery from the pandemic must not come at the expense of a return to previous levels of air pollution,” said Avinash Chanchal, senior climate campaigner, Greenpeace India. In addition to vehicular emission, experts attribute the rise in NO2 levels to high usage of fossil fuels, including coal, oil and gas. Increased economic activity is still largely coupled with toxic air pollution. “Part of this difference is attributable to changing weather conditions. After removing the effect of weather, there is still an increase of 38% which is attributed to an increase in emissions,” read the report. Earlier this year, the Centre for Science and Environment indicated that Telangana is among the top three states in the country, producing and procuring unclean coal-based power that is severely impacting the environment. As per the report, 73% of the power produced and procured by Telangana is unclean. “NO2 is much more dangerous than carbon dioxide. Neither the Central government nor the state governments have taken enough efforts to mitigate this issue. On one hand, they want to reduce the emissions but don’t want to stop using coal,” said Purushottam Reddy, well-known environmentalist. “While Telangana government promotes Haritha Haram, it’s attempt to extensively produce thermal power using coal only shows its dichotomy towards conserving the environment,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-sees-69-increase-in-key-pollutant-no2-in-last-one-yr/articleshow/84221389.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Ludhiana||Petroleum dealers say fuel hike is putting them out of business||Ludhiana: With no respite in the increasing prices of petrol and diesel, the petroleum dealers of Ludhiana are on tenterhooks, as they are claiming that the high rates are affecting their business. According to them, if government and petroleum companies do not take required steps, huge number of petrol pumps will be out of business and shut down permanently. Petroleum Dealers Association Ludhiana (PTDA) on Wednesday organised an emergency meeting of their members to discuss about the problems being faced by them. Ashok Sachdeva, chairman of the association, said, “There has been record increase in the rates of petrol and diesel and doing business has become very difficult. Our margins are fixed and with increase in the RSP of petrol and diesel, our margins have not increased, but our investments have increased. Therefore, leading to a percentage decrease in our margins. If we go by the price breakup of both products for March, our dealer margins average on petrol was Rs 3.40 per litre and on diesel was Rs 2.20 per litre, which form a very small part of the pricing while taxes both at the state and the Centre form a major part” Sachdeva also added, “Though the Centre’s taxes are uniform for all states, but Centre has increased excise duty on petrol from Rs 9.48 per litre to Rs 32.90 and on diesel excise duty has gone up from Rs 3.56 a litre to Rs 31.80 during the last few years. However, the state’s taxes vary, and it is disturbing that the Punjab government has chosen to increase the VAT and other taxes/cess on petrol and diesel, making both products expensive than the neighbouring states. The neighbouring states like Himachal Pradesh and Haryana have in fact decreased their VAT rates and are further contemplating a downward revision while Punjab has increased the taxes since March 2020, the latest being the infrastructure development tax. Due to this, huge difference has been witnessed in the rates of fuels between the two states and customers specially those having trucks and buses prefer to get their fuel requirements fulfilled from the nearby states thus causing loss to us.” According to Ranjeet Singh Gandhi, president of PTDA, “Petrol pumps have been losing capital and revenue since long and the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 has left dealers with unprecedented irrecoverable losses due to payment defaults, depressed sales, and added expenditure on safety and sanitisation. Dealers have had to invest their life savings to keep the business running and in case of further trouble, many petrol pumps may be forced to shut down. If the long due dealer margins, which have not been revised since 2017, are revised, it would help us stay in business. The oil marketing companies (OMC) instead of helping have withdrawn subsidies and normal financial assistance that helped dealers in meeting expenses for uniforms and maintaining equipment.” Gandhi also added, “While other businesses have got financial help in one way or the other, the petrol pumps, despite working during lockdowns through the pandemic have got no help, or financial package from any quarter. It is ironical that the three OMCs — Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited — have in fact all booked record profits while dealers have lost capital and income since the onset of Covid-19 pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/petroleum-dealers-say-fuel-hike-is-putting-them-out-of-business/articleshow/84217940.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While turning down the demand to stay felling of trees for the proposed Inter-Modal Station (IMS) project at Ajni, a division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Anil Kilor told the petitioners to let the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s tree authority hear and decide on the 7,000 objections first. Adjourning the hearing of two PILs on the same subject, which are clubbed together, the bench directed the petitioners to raise their contentions before the tree authority. w The first PIL was filed by Ajay Tiwari and Shweta Burbure through counsel M Anil Kumar, while the second was by Swachha Foundation secretary Sharad Paliwal through RM Tahaliyani. “Since the tree officer is seized of the matter, we are of the view that unless a decision is recorded by him, it may not be appropriate for the court to look into the issues sought to be raised in the petitions. An appropriate decision from the tree officer would make the picture clearer. It would help us in dealing with various issues involved in the PILs,” said the judges. Earlier, National Highways Authority of India counsel Anand Parchure said the tree officer would be hearing objections regarding their application to fell and translocate the trees at Ajni for the IMS. He pointed out that over 7,000 objections were received by the NMC and it would take appropriate decision shortly. The NMC has organised a public hearing for deciding the objections.

Dr NK Arora, chairman of the Covid-19 Working Group, who was part of that meeting, told TOI on Wednesday that the recommendations also extend to those traveling out of the country. He said, “There is no need for testing before or after travel, or self-quarantine after domestic trips (interstate or within states). Fully vaccinated individuals can also avoid testing before leaving India for international trips (unless required by the destination country) and don’t need to self-quarantine after their return to India.” Coronavirus live updatesDr Arora said the recommendations were made during the 16th meeting of NTAGI and NEGVAC, held in late May. “We also recommended that fully vaccinated travellers, who had contracted Covid-19 in the past, and who later recovered and are asymptomatic, can avoid quarantine and testing while travelling within the country. The minutes of the meetings have been circulated to the states for implementation,” he said. The official said “fully vaccinated” refers to those for whom it has been at least two weeks since the second dose. The recommendations were also released into the public domain recently. But several states have continued to ask fully vaccinated travellers for RT-PCR reports, a requirement which has put considerable stress on people and travel companies. Read AlsoKerala’s TPR still over 10%, a concernAmong larger states, only Kerala’s TPR is over 10%. For others the same is below 5%, except a few north-eastern states.“Most states are unaware of these recommendations and continue to impose restrictions. The Centre should issue an order to have them implemented at the state level, at the earliest, to spare travellers the difficulties,” Jyoti Mayal, president of the Travel Agents Association Of India (TAAI), said. Mayal said almost every state now has its own policy regarding RT-PCR tests and quarantine. She said, “As TAAI, we have requested the Centre to have a uniform policy for domestic travel. States such as Maharashtra, West Bengal and others should not ask for RT-PCR tests from fully vaccinated travellers. As international borders are opening, we definitely need ease of travel. This would also improve vaccine coverage in the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fully-vaccinated-travellers-can-avoid-tests-quarantine/articleshow/84217972.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: CCTV cams in new train coach help crack Rs 6.5 lakh theft||LUCKNOW: A man in casual camouflage shorts and Hawaiian pattern shirt and a mask on his face walks into the B3 coach of Paschim Express and mixes with other passengers who have just woken up from sleep after long journey from Mumbai. While some are folding their bed-sheets, others are heading to toilets to freshen up. Suddenly, the man picks up an air bag and alights from the train. Unaware that his act has been caught in high-definition quality CCTV cameras installed in the newly commissioned LHB coach, the man walks out of railway station with bag containing Rs 6.5 lakh cash, buys expensive music system and carton of foreign liquor on his way back home. However, he ran out of luck a week later when a joint team of Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Government Railway Police (GRP) of Mathura junction caught him with the remaining stolen money. The accused, Rajesh Chauhan (32) alias Vikram, who originally hails from Harchandpur village of Mainpuri, started living with his uncle and aunt in Himmatpura Dhauliyapiau area of Mathura after his parents’ death. His father was a class four employee in the railways. According to railway police, Gujarat-based businessman, Thaan Singh, lodged an FIR on June 29 morning alleging that someone had stolen his bag containing cash. Singh was heading to Delhi with his brother with around Rs 10 lakh in two airbags. “Due to the newly introduced CCTV cameras in the coach, we were able to crack the case. It was a joint effort of RPF and GRP. A team was sent to Bandra carriage and wagon department to fetch the CCTV footage. We spotted the accused after scanning the video. His still images were shared with local liquor stores, garment outlets and mobile-TV stores,” SHO, RPF, CB Prasad of Mathura junction. “A TV store owner identified the accused after which raid was conducted at Rajesh’s home. Probe teams found that the accused had thrown a liquor party for his neighbour hours after executing the theft. We also arrested another habitual offender, Sumit Kumar, who was in touch with Rajesh,” he added. Earlier too, on May 1, Rajesh was caught from Agra Cantt railway station but was later granted bail. He has 12 cases against him, including under the NDPS Act, while Sumit has six criminal cases against him.

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Low contact tracing in districts with high positivity rate sparks concern||PUNE: Some districts in the state, with high Covid test positivity rates, are still not tracing enough close contacts per confirmed case. Maharashtra currently tracks an average of 16 people for every patient. But some key districts — including Pune, Nagpur, Ahmednagar and Kolhapur — are tracing lower than the average. In Pune district, for example, authorities are tracing an average of just 13 close contacts per case. Concerned officials from the health department said they have asked all local authorities to step up surveillance, especially in light of the Delta variant, which experts have said is more infectious. State health minister Rajesh Tope has said that a minimum of 20 contacts must be traced per patient. According to data shared by the state health department, only Thane and Latur are tracing a good number of contacts, at an average of 23 and 46 persons, respectively (the highest in the state). The Centre too had called for adequate tracing, testing and isolation. “Increasing contact tracing is very important. There should not be any setback in the numbers being traced,” a health ministry official said. The health department’s data shows most districts are tracing less than the state average of 16 close contacts per patient — six high-risk and 10 low-risk. Officials said the ideal number should be more than 20, to ensure clusters are stopped from forming. Pune district, with an average of 13 contacts traced (and among regions seeing a high number of cases), has also been asked to scale up contact tracing. Only about three high-risk contacts per patient are being traced in the district currently. State task force members said tracking and testing of contacts are vital. “Contact tracing should be enhanced to 1:30 and 1:50. The current numbers are very poor. We cannot be lethargic on this front,” said task force member Dr Shashank Joshi. Members said examples such as Kolhapur, with a high positivity rate despite increased vaccination coverage, mean authorities have to watch out for breakthrough infections — Covid after inoculation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/low-contact-tracing-in-districts-with-high-positivity-rate-sparks-concern/articleshow/84217985.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Cops file chargesheet in boy’s abduction & murder in record 22 days||NAGPUR: The MIDC police have filed a chargesheet in the Raj Pandey abduction and murder case, in a record 22 days. Senior police inspector Dinesh Labde filed the chargesheet on the 22nd day from the date of murder of 14-year-old Pandey, June 10. The chargesheet was accepted by the court on Wednesday. The accused Suraj Sahu abducted and killed Raj from Indiramata Nagar in an act of revenge. He was deeply infuriated after the Pandey family moved his childhood friend-turned-lady love to Varanasi, where she was married off. Sahu is learnt to have taken Raj to the forest adjoining Salai Godhni on a bike, where he bludgeoned him to death with a stone before slitting the veins of Raj’s right hand. Commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar had instructed police to file the chargesheet as soon as possible. Zonal DCP Noorul Hasan supervised the chargesheet. The chargesheet mentions that the boy was in the custody of the accused. It also states the accused himself took the investigation agency to the place where he had committed the crime and dumped the body. Another strong evidence the police obtained and submitted along with the chargesheet was the mobile phone conversation between the accused and the victim’s family. All the audio clips of the conversations, wherein the accused had admitted that he abducted Raj, were submitted in the court. The police have also managed to recover the surgical blade used to slit the veins of the victim’s hand.

---||Lucknow||Growing economy, ease of doing business make Uttar Pradesh rebound-ready||LUCKNOW: Like the rest of the world, the first and second waves of Covid-19 have hit the state’s economy hard. Successive lockdowns, necessary as they were for saving lives, however, have compromised economic circumstances. Challenges across the world have been similar. Growth rates are compromised, industries—big and small—are all struggling for survival and state finances around the world are stressed largely because of increased expenditure along with compromised tax collection. Of late, we have seen unlocking and reopening of economies. After a great dip in GDP in 2020-21, national as well as state economies are looking forward to a revival. The government of UP too is attempting to do everything right for a robust economic revival. This seems to be an opportune time for an assessment of the state of UP’s economy and its capacity and preparedness for scripting the way forward in these very difficult times. An analysis of the state’s growth potential clearly reveals that since independence, it has been investment which has driven growth in the state. Also ease of doing business has been the major barrier in inviting investment to the state. Interestingly, on these two aspects, Uttar Pradesh seems to have done some serious work in past few years. On ease of doing business (EODB), government policies seem to be making a difference. Consequently, the state stands out and has emerged as the second best in terms of EODB. Also, over the years, the state has emerged as the second largest economy among the states of the country in terms of the size of GSDP. A large fast-growing economy along with improved business environment as depicted by EODB only redefines the potential as an attractive investment destination. In the past few years, the state government has taken many policy decisions to attract investment to the state to create job opportunities for the youth and boost GDP. This facilitated the unveiling of 250 projects worth Rs 65,000 crore in July 2019. Many of these have already become operational. The total investment during the last four years of Yogi government is estimated at more than Rs 88,000 crore, which means that on an average, there has been an investment of Rs 205 crore on a daily basis. Manufacturing has been a major challenge for India. Interestingly, UP was able to attract investment of around Rs 32,000 crore. The outcomes of the developments taking place in the electronic, manufacturing and renewable energy sectors in the state will become visible in the coming years. In the renewable energy sector, 18 companies have invested Rs 16,000 crore. Reliance JIO and BSNL have together invested Rs 15,000 crore and have started operations. Three companies in the IT sector have invested around Rs 11 crore. Infosys Limited and Tata Consultancy Services have proposed investment of Rs 5,000 crore and Rs 2,300 crore respectively and are in a position to start operations. The state obviously has done something right and the effort in these difficult circumstances is only making us rebound-ready. The proposed defence corridor only adds to the opportunity. The data of the MSME department suggests that 8.67 lakh new units were started in the state in the past eight months, which were given loans to the tune of Rs 30,840 crore by banks. Over 1.5 crore employment opportunities were created by banks by providing loans totalling more than Rs 2,12,000 crore. In a recent development, the state’s bankers committee has decided that a credit line of around Rs 3 lakh crore will be made available to the MSME sector in this financial year. This can significantly transform both growth and employment generation capacity. Unlike most parts of the world, Uttar Pradesh shows exceptional tax buoyancy in these difficult times. Almost all taxes show high buoyancy which may be reflective of the extraordinary resilience that the state demonstrates. Consumer state advantage is UP’s USP and this may have played to UP’s advantage. However, the taxes where the state had complete control show phenomenal buoyancy. Hence the government effort that goes to make this possible cannot go unnoticed. Given the global scenario of negative growth and compromised circumstances, Uttar Pradesh is scripting an extraordinary story. This year’s state budget, despite challenges, puts its money on infrastructure like roads, expressways, airports, Metros and much more. Past evidence bears testimony to the fact that the budget does have the potential to spur growth. Rise in capital expenditure to over Rs 1,13,000 crore from the previous level of around Rs 68,000 crore is likely to enhance the state’s capacity to anchor growth. Fiscal consolidation enhances its capacity to facilitate economic transformation. In the first decade of the 20th century, fiscal transformation scripted UP’s economic transition. Improved business environment as indicated by EODB, enhanced fiscal consolidation, enhanced state expenditure in infrastructure, eased credit availability for MSMEs, the state as an attractive market are all very positive indicators. Over a period, Uttar Pradesh seems to have worked on the evidence from the past and the interventions which have worked in the past have been rightly focused. Consequently, the state has brought itself in a position to anchor development. Many of the interventions seem to be falling in place and are likely to work for the state. Circumstances over the past months have been difficult. However, the state seems to have put its effort in the right direction and these are likely to bring results in the coming days.

---||Nagpur||Kin of Elgar Parishad accused say jail conditions ‘poor’||NAGPUR: After the death of activist Stan Swamy while still in custody, relatives of the other accused in the Elgar Parishad case are also complaining of poor conditions in jail. TOI talked to the kin of some of those lodged in Taloja and Byculla jails and they said it was difficult to provide them basic needs like clothes which otherwise are the right of an undertrial. Tusharkanti Bhattacharya, husband of Shoma Sen, the former Nagpur University professor arrested in the case, said during a video call they saw that her clothes were in “almost tatters”. “Physical meeting is not allowed due to Covid and even clothes cannot be handed over for some reason. Finally, after great insistence at the jail gate, they agreed to accept the clothes,” he said. “My wife also suffers from arthritis and suffers joint pains, but small facilities are denied. She needs medicines for glaucoma. The cold chain has to be maintained if the medicine has to be sent to Mumbai from Nagpur,” said Bhattacharya and also read out a letter in which Sen mentioned that another accused Jyoti Jagtap has got Covid and is in an isolation centre. Monali, sister of jailed Mahesh Raut, said he had Covid last month. “Mahesh was tested around a couple of days after Stan Swamy was found positive. The jail authorities put him in isolation along with four-five others. Soon, he developed moderate symptoms and I sent him medicines after consulting a doctor. There appeared to be no proactive medical help from the jail authorities,” she said. Mahesh, an activist from Gadchiroli, “has still not recovered from the weakness”. Hany Babu is still in hospital recovering from an eye infection after Covid, according to wife Jenny Rowena. “It’s not mucormycocis but some bacterial problem. It has affected his gland and optic nerves,” she said. Babu was taken to JJ Hospital “from the overcrowded jail” only after the condition of his eye worsened. “By that time it was difficult to even open the eye. During a routine test at JJ Hospital it was found he had Covid. Since only Covid patients could be treated there, we got him admitted to a private hospital after getting permission,”said Rowena. Delhi university professor Babu was not allowed to received clothes “on the grounds that new things from outside can spread Covid”. “Only medicines could be sent,” said Rowena. While Minal Gadling, wife of Nagpur-based lawyer Surendra Gadling, said there are no problems at present, many things improved only after “he raised voice”. “A leaking roof got fixed after he took up the issue with the authorities. Stan Swamy’s death during custody shows that health conditions are poor in jails and its time that all the accused get bail,” she said. Chhattisgarh activist Sudha Bharadwaj was denied warm clothing during winter according to Shalini Gera, her counsel and associate. “Last January, she had asked for some warm clothing. Considering the weather in Mumbai we had sent her a stole and a shawl. Both the items were returned,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kin-of-elgar-accused-say-jail-conditions-poor/articleshow/84213496.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Chennai||When southern productions were an antidote to Dilip Kumar’s tragic roles||By: VamananThe nuanced and sensitive acting of Dilip Kumar was the polar opposite of the melodramatic style of the Tamil and Telugu film industries, but when a string of melancholy roles left him drained, it was to the south that he turned. In the mid-1950s, the tragic hero image of Dilip Kumar began to take a toll on his mental health. A psychiatrist in London he consulted suggested a simple cure: Avoid tragic films, take up light, breezy roles! Even as ‘Mughal-e-Azam’ director K Asif dared Dilip Kumar to explore unchartered territory, owner and film producer Sriramulu Naidu approached him with a proposal to remake ‘Malaikallan’, a Robin Hood spin-off that had propelled MGR to stardom. Dilip saw the film, liked it, and sought permission to tweak it to his own style. And Naidu, who was otherwise known to have his own way, acceded. ‘Azaad’ went on to become a phenomenal hit commercially, apart from helping Dilip Kumar break away from being typecast as the tragedy king. It also proved to be therapeutic for the actor. With such a happy start and many more pleasant memories to cherish, Chennai will feel a greater and more poignant pang in saying goodbye to Dilip Saab. It was the city that had captured his heart. It was the city where he celebrated his honeymoon after marrying Saira Banu, with the garden house of a wealthy Muslim businessman at Valasaravakkam proving to be a pastoral haven. The consummate actor had shifted to Chennai in the mid-1960s when Bombay producers sought to put a ceiling on the number of films that actors could sign. It was not a problem for him as he did not accept more than one film at a time. But he wanted to make a point about encroachment on personal and professional freedom. It was the respect of the film and studio barons of Chennai that gave Dilip Kumar the courage to take up work here. They won his heart not only through their affection for him, but also by giving him the freedom to fashion the film. It was in this manner that ‘Ram Aur Shyam’ (1967) was made in the sprawling Vauhini Studios. One can see the departures in Dilip Kumar’s version from the Tamil and Telugu films on which it was based, but he was allowed to have his way. Tamil and Telugu films have been largely known more for melodramatic acting, and Dilip Saab’s nuanced performances served as a benchmark in realistic acting for aspiring talent in the south. His romantic pairing with the city’s own heartthrob Vyjayanthimala in more than half-a-dozen films including such icons as ‘Devdas’ (1955), ‘Madhumathi’ (1958) and ‘Ganga Jamuna’ (1961) brought him closer home to the local audience. Gemini Studio’s S S Vasan became a close friend of Dilip Kumar, and the two travelled together across the state. Dilip appreciated Vasan’s easy manner. "When Vasan came to the airport to give me a send-off after ‘Paigam’ had been completed, he spoke very little about the film. A good producer must know what he must say at a particular moment. In such things, Vasan was a consummate master,’’ Dilip Kumar had written in a tribute to Vasan. The film ‘Aadmi’, where Dilip Kumar had to portray a character who was possessive and distrustful of his partner, proved to be challenging for the actor and producer P S Veerappa. Dilip Kumar wrestled with the difficulties involved in depicting the throes of a guilt-ridden, obsessional character, while the producer grappled with financial problems caused by delays in production. When the film bombed it was the last straw for the producer. Dilip Kumar is said to have commiserated with him and given him the Tamil-remake rights of ‘Ganga Jamuna’. Bhimsingh, the film editor-turned-director-producer who had helmed many of Sivaji Ganesan’s great melodramas, directed Dilip Kumar in ‘Gopi’ (1970), in which the actor starred with his wife Saira Banu. The film, a remake of the Sivaji-starrer ‘Muradan Muthu’, saw the thespian coming up with another rivetingly realistic performance as a dedicated maker of idols of Hindu deities. The astute actor was also known for his humility and affable personality. There is the very reliable anecdote of a newspaper baron leaving him in the company of a senior journalist in Chennai. Sheepishly, the latter confessed to the actor that he had never seen a single film of his. ‘‘Nothing to worry,’’ quipped Dilip Kumar, adding, ‘You surely know the ‘Mahabharata’. We can discuss it’’. The journalist was astounded by the deep knowledge the actor showed in the subject. Dilip Saab’s films made by southern producers may be only a handful. But he left a deep and profound mark on the minds of the audience in the south through his acting skills as well as his humility.

---||Pune||Maharashtra warning after over 10% vaccine wastage in some districts||PUNE: Vaccine wastage continues to be a concern in some districts of the state. Districts such as Chandrapur, Dhule, Gadchiroli, Kolhapur, Latur, Parbhani, Sangli, Sindhudurg, Nanded and Satara, have reported relatively high levels of Covaxin wastage. In some cases, wastage has been more than the permissible 10%, data from the public health department shows. As for the Covishield vaccine, districts of Beed, Dhule, Gondia, Latur, Parbhani, Mumbai are reporting wastage of 5%. The Centre’s guidelines have also factored in an allowable wastage of 10%. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary of the public health department, in a written communication to collectors, divisional and municipal commissioners, urged them to control vaccine wastage. In his letter, Dr Vyas said some districts have reported negative vaccine wastage, which means they have drawn more doses from vials. But he said there are districts “that have reported very high levels of vaccine wastage, which needs to be minimized”. At least 20 state districts — including Pune, Ahmednagar, Nagpur, Amravati and Jalgaon — have reported Covishield wastage at 0% or less. A fewer number — nearly eight districts — have so far reported 0% or lower wastage of Covaxin. One of the ways to avoid wastage is for vaccinators to extract more doses from a vial and show negative wastage, the health ministry had said. Data has also shown that some districts are vaccinating less than 100 beneficiaries on average per session, which could be causing wastage or sub-optimal use of resources. The state average is 104 beneficiaries per session. The health ministry had said that each vaccination session is expected to cover a minimum of 100 beneficiaries. Since vaccines being used are currently not under the ‘open-vial policy’ and must be used up within a stipulated period, low turnouts at vaccination centres can cause wastage. DN Patil, state immunization officer, said, “Vaccine wastage data is uploaded by the districts on CoWIN (which has the inbuilt eVIN or Electronic Vaccine intelligence network system). Sometimes, when there are delays in uploading latest stock data, it may seem like wastage. But that isn't the case. Only minimal districts are reporting higher vaccine wastage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-warning-after-over-10-vax-wastage-in-some-dists/articleshow/84218005.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Lucknow||Doctor Sharda Suman to be airlifted to Hyderabad or Chennai for transplant||LUCKNOW: A day after the state government allocated Rs 1.5 crore for the lung transplant of a 31-year-old female resident doctor of Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS), its director Prof Sonia Nityanand on Wednesday said two hospitals in south India have assured to take up the case as early as possible. “We spoke to four institutes that perform lung transplants: KIMS Hospital and Yashoda Hospital in Hyderabad and MGM Hospital and Apollo Hospital in Chennai. All responded positively, but KIMS Hyderabad and MGM Hospital have promised to make arrangements at the earliest,” said Prof Nityanand, addressing media persons. “As soon as a date is finalised in either of the hospitals, the resident will be taken to the place through air ambulance. The hospital will send a team for pre-transplant assessments, which will help them in finding a suitable cadaver lung. The district administration will be requested to make a green corridor till the airport,” she added. Dr Sharda Suman, a postgraduate resident at RMLIMS’s gynaecology department, had contracted Covid-19 on April 14. She was eight months pregnant then. As her condition deteriorated, she was put on a ventilator and an emergency C-section surgery was done on May 1 to save her child. Dr Suman was put on the ECMO or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine which pumps and oxygenates a patient’s blood outside the body, allowing the heart and lungs to rest. The director constituted a three-member committee on July 1 to assess the condition of the resident. The committee headed by pulmonary and critical care expert from KGMU Lt Gen (retd) Prof BNBM Prasad comprised RMLIMS’s anaesthesia unit head Prof PK Das and medical superintendent Prof Vikram Singh. It recommended a lung transplant. Officials said that barring the lungs of the resident, all other organs are responding well “As the resident’s family cannot afford lung transplant, we met chief minister Yogi Adityanath who agreed to sanction funds required for the procedure,” said Prof Nityanand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/doc-to-be-airlifted-to-hyd-or-chennai-for-transplant/articleshow/84220176.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Much of its activities revolved around Dilip Kumar, for whom Rafi sang in most of his acclaimed films. So as soon as the news came in, the members, started alerting each other on Whatsapp to rustle up a virtual tribute through songs, video clippings and voice recordings. A bigger physical programme will be done once the pandemic situation improves. Some of the Circle members were not only die-hard fans of the great actor, but were in direct touch with Dilip Kumar, even visiting his residence. The president of the Circle, Ruhi Khan, was the closest to him. She was a regular at the household because of her uncle T A Khan, a personal friend of Dilip Kumar. “I cannot believe this. Yes, he was ill and had been critical, but the passing was so sudden,” she sobbed, remembering the days when the two would sit for hours discussing Rafi and even singing. “Kabhi kami nahi aane dena apne jazbaat mein,” he had once said after listening to me. Wednesday’s virtual meet was tagged, O Door Ke Musafir Hum Ko Bhi Saath Le Le and members said that July had taken Dilip Kumar’s voice (Rafi) earlier and now him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rafi-fans-in-kol-mourn-dilip-saab/articleshow/84215676.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Pune||Weak vaccine supply slows pace of coverage across Pune||PUNE: Irregular vaccine supply during the first week of this month has impacted drives across the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). Officials with the PMC said their vaccination drives are able to have good momentum only for a few days in a week due to the intermittent supply of shots from the Centre. A PMC official said, “On Wednesday, for example, the civic body had just about 60 operational vaccination sites for Covishield. There were not enough doses. On Tuesday, we had 191 centres. For Thursday, we are left with no Covishield doses; only Covaxin is being offered, from just six vaccination centres. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said vaccine supply to the region is likely to stay at current levels till next month, at least until shots such as Johnson and Johnson’s single-shot vaccine or other brands are available. The Centre had recently said that the Russian-made Sputnik would soon be available for free at government centres. Deshmukh said, “We received around 2.8 lakh doses of vaccines during the first week of July. Centres have been instructed to exhaust their stock, as soon as possible, to get the next one.” In Pimpri Chinchwad, the PCMC has a few thousand doses of Covishield left for Thursday (the civic body had a vaccine holiday on Wednesday). PCMC officials said for Thursday, a total of eight sites will offer the first dose of Covishield to the 18-44 age group. Another eight will offer the first and second dose to the 45-plus group. Four vaccination sites will offer Covaxin to the 18-44 and 45-plus groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/weak-supply-slows-pace-of-coverage-across-region/articleshow/84218049.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Ranchi||20,000 students of govt residential schools to get tabs for online learning||RANCHI: Nearly 20,000 students of the residential schools run by the state department of the SC, ST, minority and backward class welfare will soon have internet-enabled mobile tablets for online learning. The department drafted a proposal for providing internet-enabled tablets last month. The proposal has been recommended by the department’s minister Champai Soren and is currently pending with the state department of planning and finance for approval. Upon the approval, the proposal will be put up before the state cabinet for its approval. The department currently runs 143 residential schools across 24 districts of the state. Of them, 98 are residential schools for boys while 45 are for girls. However, this scheme will not be extended to the Eklavya Model Schools, which are run by the Centre. “The proposal has been drafted along the lines of the Centre’s proposal for the Eklavya Model schools. The tablets will be incorporated with study materials by the NCERT,” a senior official in the department said requesting anonymity. Besides the tablets, the department will also provide sim cards with internet recharge of 12 months. The internet data will be up to 2 GB for a day. “The need for distributing internet-enabled mobile tablets was felt as all the residential schools being run by the department are currently closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The closure has adversely impacted the academics of the students,” the official added. Soren did not respond to TOI’s calls when contacted to understand whether the students will be provided the tablets even if the schools reopen in the coming days. The proposal stands in stark contrast with the state-run varsities, which have asked its faculty and students to arrange for equipment and internet for online classes by themselves. Seizing the opportunity of the closure provided by the pandemic, the department said it is also taking up maintenance and infrastructure overhaul of 50 residential schools at a net cost of Rs 30 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/20000-students-of-govt-residential-schools-to-get-tabs-for-online-learning/articleshow/84217648.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Rims plans surgery of black fungus patient after Jharkhand HC rap||RANCHI: Hours after the Jharkhand high court pulled up the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), Ranchi for negligence of a 45-year-old black fungus patient named Usha Devi, who has been admitted at the state-run hospital since May 17, the hospital swung into action and has now planned her surgery for Thursday. Last week, Usha’s son Gaurav Gupta had written to chief minister Hemant Soren where he, besides requesting the CM for monetary help, had brought to his attention to the ‘lackadaisical attitude of the doctors at Rims’ which led to the worsening condition of his mother. He had claimed that his mother has been admitted at the hospital for more than one and a half months and the doctors’ negligence made her condition critical. Like Usha, many mucormycosis (black fungus) patients at Rims – which has been designated as a centre of excellence for treating mucormycosis patients after the state government notified the fungal infection as an epidemic -- are faced with a similar ordeal. On Wednesday, TOI visited the dengue ward, which has been converted into a dedicated ward for mucormycosis patients, and found that many are in need of a surgery and the doctors haven’t even informed them when exactly that will take place. Some of the patients’ relatives claimed that compulsory surgeries are being postponed or cancelled due to the lack of co-ordination among the doctors. TOI spoke to an ENT specialist and surgeon named Dr Abhishek Kumar Ramadhin, who has been treating black fungus patients for some months, and he said that it is imperative to remove the fungal load of such patients and debridement surgery is the only to go about it. “There are different kinds of fungal infection and many can be treated with medicines only but black fungus requires surgery. I have treated 29 patients of mucormycosis and I have operated on all of them because medicines alone cannot cure such patients,” he said. As per the hospital’s records, 51 mucormycosis patients have been treated at Rims till date, of which, three patients underwent surgery. At present, 21 patients are currently admitted at Rims. The rest were either discharged or died from the infection. According to some sources at the hospital, over a dozen patients were declared fit for surgery by the doctors of the anaesthesia department last month but the surgeons from ENT department did not operate on them. “In the past one and a half months, my colleagues and I have declared 14 mucormycosis patients fit for surgery after conducting a pre anaesthesia check-up but only three have undergone surgery till date. I do not know the reasons behind it but the nodal officer should take a note of it,” a doctor in the anaesthesia department said. TOI tried contacting the nodal officer for mucormycosis at Rims, Dr C K Birua, to enquire about the reasons behind the low number of surgeries but she didn’t respond to calls. Some patients even said that they are forced to purchase medicines from outside. “My wife was admitted here for around a week and the doctors discharged her after assuring us that she has recovered. However, her health deteriorated once we took her home and she had to be re-admitted. I have already spent over Rs 50,000 in purchasing Posconazole,” one Prabhu Ram said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rims-plans-surgery-of-black-fungus-patient-after-hc-rap/articleshow/84215444.cms||Gaurav Pandey

With this, cops also detected 21 cases of silencer thefts from Suzuki Ecco cars. The gang stole these silencers particularly for the dust inside contains Palladium, a precious metal. Police arrested Anilgiri Goswami, 35, Keyur alias Kalu Ajani, 20, Bhavin Zalavadiya, 22, Jaimish alias Titiyo Dhanani, 19, Danish alias Dano Mansuri, 21, Abdul Kadar Mansuri, 23 and detained a teenage boy for alleged involvement in the theft racket. The accused sold the silencers to Dilli Scrap Kabadi and Nizami Scrap Kabadi at Kamrej. The dust was sold in Delhi. Police recovered valuables worth Rs 10.51 lakh that include 11.7 gram dust, 21 silencers, a car, three two wheelers and mobile phones from the accused. “Each silencer contains around 800 gram dust which was sold for Rs 35,000 per kilo. The accused targeted only Ecco cars since there is space to go below the car and remove the silencer. Every car silencer has similar material,” said a crime branch official. Recently, another gang was caught by Salabatpura police that too was involved in thefts of silencer from Ecco car. Accused Goswami and Ajani run a CNG kit fitting garage in Mota Varachha. They stole silencers from Ecco cars that came for CNG kit fitting. They would replace the old silencer with a stolen new silencer from other cars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/gang-stealing-car-silencer-for-palladium-dust-arrested/articleshow/84214731.cms||---

They even failed to get Jharkhand its due share of GST and mining royalties. Now the induction of Annapurna-Ji will be of little help to the state as BJP treats its MPs from Jharkhand as bandhuwa mazdoors (bonded labourers),” JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said. JMM, which has been critical of the Centre for its handling of the pandemic since March last year, demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah must step down from their offices after taking moral responsibility of the mayhem caused by the viral outbreak nationwide. “Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ were made to resign based on their performances. If that is the case, then the PM and Shah must resign for violating the disaster management rules and attending and addressing the countless swarming electoral rallies in West Bengal, Assam and other states,” Bhattacharya claimed. JMM also criticized the Centre and accused it of harbouring anti-tribal and Dalit sentiments. “Jesuit priest Fr. Stan Swamy was implicated in the Bhima Koregaon case because he lent his voice to a Dalit movement. Likewise, the Centre replaced Jharkhand’s first tribal woman Governor Droupadi Murmu yesterday. This is not a coincidence. It speaks volumes about the BJP’s intentions and its outlook towards the tribal people and Dalit communities,” Bhattacharya added. JMM also claimed that while Covid-19 was preventing its workers from taking to the streets to condemn Swamy’s death, it will seek an audience with President Ram Nath Kovind if he does not intervene after receiving the petition which was sent jointly by 10 prominent opposition politicians across the country, including Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/new-cabinet-minister-wont-prove-beneficial-for-state-claims-jmm/articleshow/84217829.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||3rd MP from state to join Union ministry||Ranchi: A first-time MP from Koderma constituency, Annapurna Devi (51), was inducted into the Union council of ministers following a major reshuffle on Wednesday. She is now the third MP from the state to go on central assignment in Team Modi. Khunti MP Arjun Munda is currently holding the portfolio of the Union tribal ministry, while Rajya Sabha MP Mukthar Abbas Naqvi is in charge of minority affairs. While Devi’s portfolio is yet to be announced, her rise in profile has come as a surprise for many in the political circles in Jharkhand, including in the state BJP unit. She is a former long-time close aide of RJD chief Lalu Prasad but joined BJP in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls deserting RJD, of which she was the state president too. BJP later fielded her from Koderma constituency against ex-CM Babulal Marandi, the chief of now-defunct JVM-P. She trumped Marandi by a margin of 4,55,600 votes. Last year, she was made the national vice-president of the BJP. Devi’s entry into politics occurred after the death of her husband, Ramesh Prasad Yadav, in 1998. Yadav was then a minister in the Rabri Devi government in undivided Bihar. Since then, Devi went on to represent Koderma assembly seat four times. In 2014, she lost to BJP’s Neera Yadav. Devi also served twice in state governments — once in Bihar and then in Jharkhand. In 2013, during UPA regime under the leadership of Hemant Soren, she was inducted as a cabinet minister (irrigation, women and child welfare, registration). She also served as the minister of state for mines and geology in Bihar government before 2000. The news of her induction has enthused party workers in her constituency. Raj Kumar Yadav, one of the close aides of Devi, said over the phone that entire Koderma is elated with the news. “Modi-ji has rewarded a dedicated party worker and a woman, who rose from scratch due to her work at the ground level. All party workers are highly elated and are in celebratory mood,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/3rd-mp-from-state-to-join-union-ministry/articleshow/84217757.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Vadodara||SOG cop put through suspect detection test||Vadodara: It’s been almost a month since thirty-seven-year-old Sweety, wife of police inspector Ajay Desai, has been missing. The case has left the investigators baffled as they have failed to make any headway despite probing different angles. Meanwhile, Desai is undergoing suspect detection test at the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), Gandhinagar, over the last two days. Under the test, the suspect’s heart beats and blood pressure is measured while interrogation and experts make a report on whether the suspect is lying or speaking truth while replying to the questions. Sweety has been missing since June 5 and Desai maintains that she was at home till the previous day. On the other hand, the investigators haven’t found any CCTV footage showing that she left her house in Karjan on June 5. “Footage of CCTVs near her residential colony don’t show her exiting her home or the locality. It’s baffling as there is no clue about where she must have gone. We checked her house and a team from FSL even conducted tests there to get some clues. But we didn’t find any clues pointing towards foul play,” said Kalpesh Solanki, deputy superintendent (DySP) rural. Last month Desai had told the police that he woke up on the morning of June 5 and found Sweety, who is mother of a two-year-old kid, missing. Later, Desai informed Sweety’s brother Jaydeep Patel who rushed to the city from his hometown Dakor. When Patel too failed to find her, he approached the Karjan police and filed a missing person’s application. The cops had taken statements from Desai and Sweety’s family members but they failed to track her down. Also, Sweety left her mobile phone at home. The cops now plan to go through her call details to check if she was in regular contact with someone. DSP rural had ordered an inquiry in the case some days ago and Desai was sent on leave. The cops also issued lookout notices with Sweety’s photograph and distributed it at temples, crossroads, railway stations and bus stops in Vadodara rural and city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sog-cop-put-through-suspect-detection-test/articleshow/84214386.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This comes two days after four suspected cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), which is linked to Covid-19, was reported at the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Hospital in Adityapur. “All hospitals that have a paediatric facility should be careful while dealing with the post Covid-linked cases and every case has to be reported to the department immediately,” district surveillance officer Jhujhar Majhi said. On Tuesday, Majhi had sought a detailed report from the medical superintendent of ESIC, M P Minz, in the aftermath four suspected MIS-C cases being reported at the hospital. Majhi said that the hospital has not shared the report yet however, the superintendent has confirmed that all the four children are doing well following their treatment. Minz said that out of the four children, all of whom were admitted since Monday, one has been discharged. He added, “A three-year-old boy was discharged on Tuesday evening after his condition improved while a two-year-old and a 10-year-old are undergoing treatment at the moment. The other one, a 12-year-old boy, was referred to Tata Main Hospital as he needed ventilation support. His condition is improving.” Responding to a query, Minz said, “I have communicated the information about the admission of the four children to the district health officials over phone. The diagnosis and treatment reports would be shared shortly.” Meanwhile, Majhi said that the district health department has readied a 10-bed capacity paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for post-Covid-linked ailments in children at sadar hospital in Seraikela. He added that the suspected cases of MIS-C would first be referred for counselling once they are reported at the sadar hospital, following which, an investigation into the cause of the symptoms would be done and if the patient requires admission for further treatment, then he/she would be admitted at the PICU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/seraikela-hosps-told-to-inform-admin-about-post-cov-cases/articleshow/84215385.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||HC pulls up Jharkhand over black fungus treatment||RANCHI: The Jharkhand high court came down heavily on the state government on Wednesday while hearing a public interest litigation on the condition of patients suffering from black fungus in Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims). A division bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad while hearing the PIL initiated suo motu by the court said that if the state cannot ensure treatment of its people in a government-run hospital, will they have to sell their lands to procure treatment, the bench rebuked. The court has sought for a detailed status report in the matter. The PIL was initiated by the bench based on media reports of one Usha Devi not receiving proper treatment for black fungus in Rims. Usha Devi’s children had requested the chief minister to help their mother. The two siblings, Gaurav and Puja, have written a letter to chief minister Hemant Soren urging him to provide an air ambulance to airlift their mother to a better medical centre in Ahmedabad or Kerala. The children were shunned out of the chief minister’s residential office informing them that they can only be given monetary help up to Rs 1 lakh only. The government does not have funds to provide an air ambulance, the siblings were said. Media reports further said that Usha Devi was admitted in Rims on May 17 and her treatment was delayed for two days and the infection had spread over her face affecting an eye and also her brain. Medicines were also not provided to the patient, the newspapers reported. The high court while hearing the petition online queried from the Rims director whether medicines are provided to patients in Rims or do they have to buy medicines from outside. The Rims director admitted that not all medicines were available in the hospital and there was a shortage in supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hc-pulls-up-jharkhand-over-black-fungus-treatment/articleshow/84215846.cms||---

Police rushed to a wedding at Kundu Kundu Bhawan in Khasmahal area under Parsudih police station area on Tuesday night after receiving reports that shots were fired at the venue. Sources said a youth fired from his pistol during the baraat procession around 11.30pm which sparked panic among the guests. When the police arrived, the youth had fled taking advantage of the commotion, leaving behind the pistol. Parsudih police station officer-in-charge Rajendra Das said on initial questioning of the relatives of the bridegroom, it appeared that the youth was not on the invited list. When firecrackers were being burst, the youth fished out his pistol and started firing in the air. This led to a lot of commotion at the venue and people started to leave in a hurry. Das said the police are trying to find out if the pistol was registered or illegal. The police said the bridegroom is a resident of Namda Bustee area and the bride hails from Parsudih. The kin of the bride had booked Kundu Bhawan for the marriage ceremony. The police are yet to arrest anyone in connection with the incident. A hunt is on for the youth. After the arrival of the police, the wedding rituals were completed quickly and the place was vacated within an hour. Meanwhile, health experts are questioning why steps are not being taken to prevent big-budget weddings, when the government has clearly given directives that not more than 50 persons will be allowed at the marriage ceremonies and under no condition there will be any kind of baraat procession. A retired doctor of the state-run MGMMCH said on one hand the government is continuing with its complete lockdown on weekends and on weekdays too there are still several restrictions, but no steps are being taken to stop weddings on a grand scale, which can be Covid super-spreading events. She said everyday baraat processions can be seen on Jamshedpur roads and the administration does nothing. The 50-guest list for wedding functions is not being followed in most of the places, the doctor added. She said if no steps are taken, the possible third wave can be a reality soon. She said even on Tuesday, 17 Covid cases were detected in the district and one death recorded. She said till Tuesday, 14,000 samples are awaiting test results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/wedding-guests-in-jsr-run-scared-after-intruder-fires-shots-cops-rush-to-spot/articleshow/84217796.cms||Debasish Chatterjee
---||Ranchi||Rise of Annapurna Devi: From Lalu’s close aide to key player in Team Modi||Ranchi: The induction of 51-year-old Annapurna Devi, a first-time MP from Koderma in the Narendra Modi cabinet could surprise many other aspirants and leaders in the saffron camp in Jharkhand, but political experts maintained that the move is in view of consolidating OBC vote bank, which forms a major chunk after the tribals, for BJP’s mission 2024. Though the BJP had decimated the UPA in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls by winning 12 out of 14 parliamentary seats, six months down the line, the saffron party was thrown out of power in the Assembly elections that year, despite offering the state its first stable government for a full five-year term. One of the key reasons for the party’s rout during the 2019 Assembly elections was division of OBC votes due to the split between BJP and its long-time ally, AJSU-P. Both the parties fought separately and suffered major setbacks in OBC pockets. “While the Scheduled Tribes (STs) constitute 26.2 per cent, OBCs constitute about 46.1 per cent of the Jharkhand population, according to 2011 Census. Though we had an OBC chief minister (Raghubar Das) between 2014 and 2019, the BJP failed to consolidate that chunk in favour of the party despite ruling for a full five years. After Raghubar Das’s own defeat in the Assembly election and party being out of power, the BJP is in need of a strong OBC face for its political endeavours. That is the sole reason why of all MPs, Annapurnaji’s induction could be possible,” remarked a senior party leader and an MLA on condition of anonymity. Another BJP worker added that following today’s development, the BJP has addressed two big vote banks — tribals and OBCs. “While former chief minister and Khunti MP Arjun Munda has already been a Union minister in the current Modi government, Annapurna’s entry testifies that the party is working to strengthen its other grey pockets in this state to woo Yadavs, Kurmis, and the likes among OBCs. Also, a message has been sent out that Jharkhand is an important state for the BJP as part of its consolidation in the East,” he said. Annapurna entered the BJP right ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, deserting the RJD, of which she was also the state president. Her entry into the politics occurred after the death of her husband Ramesh Prasad Yadav in 1998 who was then a minister in the RJD government led by Rabri Devi in undivided Bihar. Since then, she went on to represent Koderma Assembly seat four times on an RJD ticket and became one of the long-time close aides of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad. The BJP’s decision to field her from Koderma parliamentary seat stood vindicated after she won by a vast margin of over 4 lakh votes against stalwart Babulal Marandi (now defunct JVM-P). Since then, there wasn’t any looking back for her, even though she always remained low-profile within the state unit, said many. She went on to successfully cultivate great equations with the central leadership, mainly with national president J.P. Nadda and Bhupinder Yadav, who was in-charge of Jharkhand affairs and has also been inducted into the Union cabinet today. “Her immediate escalation as the national vice-president of the BJP months after her joining was a testimony to the party’s faith in her. She was later also made the co-in-charge of Haryana and was assigned to take care of Bihar during the Assembly elections along areas bordering Jharkhand. The NDA managed to win a good number of seats in her command areas,” said an insider, adding that her entry into Team Modi may not be a good omen for ex-chief minister Raghubar Das now. “It was he (Das) who brought her to the party before Lok Sabha election to clinch Koderma. Later, Das lost his seat in the Assembly elections. Following Annapurna’s induction into the cabinet, whatever little aspirations or chances, he (Das) was nursing to lobby for a berth as part of political rehabilitation, is over for the time being. If the BJP high command wanted, it could have easily roped in Das for a central role by giving him a Rajya Sabha ticket from any safe place,” he said. On the latest induct, BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said, “The entire state BJP thanks PM and party high command for the fresh induction, that too a woman. This proves that any dedicated party worker can rise through the ranks with his or her work. Presence of two MPs in Modi government will certainly help in overall development of the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rise-of-annapurna-devi-from-lalus-close-aide-to-key-player-in-team-modi/articleshow/84215315.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||India||Act immediately: 8 states with high positivity rates told||NEW DELHI: Raising concern over certain districts reporting high Covid positivity rate, the Centre has called for stricter action to control the spread of infection. Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan has written to eight states with high positivity rates, urging them to take immediate action to bring down cases and also share details of the actions taken as per the Disaster Management Act. The states that have received the communication sent out by health ministry are Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Kerala, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Odisha and Sikkim. These states have the maximum number of districts with above 10% positivity. “Although the trajectory of daily new cases has come down substantially in the country, there is need for continued monitoring of weekly case positivity, as well as case trajectory in each district to identify any early warning signals of spread of infection,” Bhushan said in his letters to the chief secretaries. For instance, the letter to chief secretary of Arunachal Pradesh — which has the highest 19 out of its 25 districts reporting over 10% positivity rate — pointed out the concern that the state reported a weekly positivity rate of 16.2% during June 28-July 4. The positivity rate in the state has been increasing over the last four weeks, Bhushan said. The state reported 12% rise in weekly new cases. Similarly, Bhushan’s letter to Jishnu Bharua, chief secretary of Assam, expressed concern that 29 of 33 districts in the state reported more than 100 new cases in the week ended July 4. The Centre emphasised the need for stricter containment measures, increasing in testing, and ramping up vaccination. “It is imperative to note that containment is the most crucial strategy of flattening the curve. It is critical to strengthen the for prompt contact-tracing and quarantine of all cases,” the Centre’s communication said. With 60% of the districts across India having case positivity rate of over 10% located in the northeast, home secretary Ajay Bhalla on Wednesday asked them to follow the five-fold strategy of ‘test-track-treat-vaccinate and adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour’. At a meeting chaired by him, the current status and trends of active cases, case fatality rate (CFR), case positivity rate (CPR) and vaccination status was discussed. It was noted that out of 73 districts in the country with CPR above 10 %, 46 districts are in the northeast, where strict containment measures need to be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/act-immediately-8-states-with-high-positivity-rates-told/articleshow/84222281.cms||Sushmi Dey

The bill will be introduced in monsoon session of the Goa legislative assembly. When Goa was part of the Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu, various acts were passed by the legislature. After the enactment of the Goa, Daman and Diu Reorganisation Act, 1987, Goa became a separate state, while Daman and Diu remained a Union territory. After Goa’s statehood, various legislations enacted by the then Union territory continued to remain in force, and thus it is now proposed to omit the expression ‘Daman and Diu’ from the said acts. CM Pramod Sawant, in his Statehood Day speech, announced the move to remove the words from the acts. Meanwhile, the state cabinet on Wednesday granted ex-post facto approval to release Rs 1.1 crore as grant-in-aid to supplement payment of salaries to the staff of the administrator of comunidades of both districts.

---||Goa||Goa: Mobile tower rent cut to Rs 5,000 per month in govt land, says CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: To encourage private players to install mobile towers in rural areas and provide quality internet facility, the state government on Wednesday decided to reduce the mobile tower rent from Rs 50,000 to Rs 5,000 per month for a period of five years in government properties. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that 141 permissions have been sought to install mobile towers on government land in rural areas. The decision has been taken after it was brought to the notice of the state government that students who are presently attending online classes are facing hardship due to poor network facility in rural talukas. Speaking to mediapersons, the chief minister said that companies can install mobile towers in rural areas and pay only 10% of the government approved rent. He also said that nobody has come forward to install towers in rural areas. Sawant said that after five years, the rent would be 25% of the rent fixed by the state government. He also said that earlier, the rent was not affordable for mobile companies due to lack of adequate business. He also said that when the media reports about poor network connectivity, it should also prominently highlight how the public are opposing mobile towers in their localities. “We publish news of poor connectivity, but we don’t publish news of people opposing installation of mobile towers. We have to highlight such news so that people of the state are aware of the opposition to mobile towers,” he said. “I have received around 70 complaints of towers being opposed by people,” Sawant said. He also said that the government will focus on installing towers in rural areas like Canacona and Sattari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mobile-tower-rent-cut-to-rs-5k/month-in-govt-land-cm/articleshow/84218584.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Hackers targetted Nagpur ATM machines with deposit facility: Investigation||NAGPUR: Bajaj Nagar police to probe how hackers got list and locations of ATM machines of a particular make installed by State Bank of India. The hackers are likely to have procured the leaked list of ATM machines to steal cash but evade getting transactions recorded. Earlier this week, the city police had in a joint operation arrested two ATM hackers, Anees Khan and Mohd Taleeb, from Palwal in Haryana. Another team has been camping there in search of the third accused. A team of Nagpur police now waiting to nab Panchhi Khan, who along with Anees, had used Taleeb’s wife’s card to steal Rs 6.75 lakh from 4 SBI ATMs of the same make situated in different parts of the city between June 14 and 16. Senior PI of Bajaj Nagar police station Shubhangi Deshmukh told TOI that city police had obtained a three-day police custody remand of the two arrested from a court in Jaipur in Rajasthan. The city police are likely to bring them to Nagpur on Wednesday night. “We will produce them in the local court on Friday (July 9) for their remand,” she said. Deshmukh said that all the ATMs the accused targeted had both facilities of withdrawal and deposit. It is being suspected that the gang had a pan-India list of such machines. A similar case was reported from other cities too. The police will try to ascertain these details from the accused, the senior PI said. Police sources said that recently the Greater Chennai police too had apprehended a suspect in New Delhi who was part of a similar gang that targeted SBI ATMs with cash deposit facilities. The gang had targeted 18 SBI ATMs in Chennai between June 17 and 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hackers-targetted-atm-machines-with-deposit-facility-investigation/articleshow/84214685.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

She was throttled and smothered to death with a pillow when she resisted a robbery at her residence. Police have arrested two of the three suspects, including a washerman, Raju (24), who had been visiting the house for five years. His alleged accomplice is a driver working with the foreign ministry on contract. It was the maid who opened the door of the second floor apartment in A-15 block around 8.45-9pm when Raju turned up at the house. She was immediately overpowered by him, dragged to a room, thrashed and then tied up. Meanwhile, his alleged accomplices had entered the house. As Kumaramangalam resisted and tried to raise an alarm, she was strangulated and smothered with a pillow. How house worker helped catch 2 murder suspectsAs she seemed to have fallen unconscious, the three men ransacked the house. Before leaving, they returned to the maid and tried to smother her as well because she would have identified Raju. However, she put up a stiff resistance. They left after threatening her and asking her not to disclose anything to police. After around two hours, the maid managed to untie herself and raised an alarm. Police were alerted around 11pm and soon a team reached the house. Kumaramangalam and the maid were rushed to the hospital where the former was declared dead on arrival. The scene of crime was examined by forensics for clues. The cops spotted open briefcases in the house. By then the maid had disclosed the washerman's role. Multiple teams were formed for his arrest and an FIR of murder and robbery was registered. A separate team was assigned to obtain and analyse the footage from CCTV cameras. Local inquiries revealed that Raju lived in the nearby Bhanwar Singh camp. Police raided the camp and arrested him in the early hours of Wednesday. He allegedly confessed to the crime. By noon, the cops had arrested the second suspect as well. He was identified as Rakesh (34), a resident of Munirka village, who works on contract with the foreign ministry, said police. Rakesh, a close friend of Raju, is claimed to have told the cops that he was given Rs 60,000 as his share. A hunt is on for the third suspect, Suraj, said police. He is learned to have fled to Jaipur to dispose of the jewellery. Raju is learned to have chosen Kumaramangalam as a target because she mostly used to live alone. She was not enrolled as a senior citizen. Her daughter, Ruchira, and her son would off and on stay with her. Kumaramangalam's husband was a minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government during 1998-2000. He was also a junior minister in the PV Narasimha Rao government between 1991 and 1993. He passed away in 2000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-late-union-minister-p-rangarajan-kumaramangalams-wife-killed-in-robbery-at-vasant-vihar-house/articleshow/84222476.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Goa||Goa: Sattari teachers forego internet, work from students’ home||VALPOI: Students of remote areas of Sattari have been facing severe challenges with their online classes for over a year now. While patchy internet connectivity is forcing many to trek through forests in search of network to be able to connect to their online classes, for some others it is the inability to afford a smartphone or data packs due to their family’s economic situation. Realising the impact two years of patchy connectivity can have on students’ academic progress, heads and teachers of some government schools in Sattari have decided to take the classroom to the homes of such students. Headmistress of Government High School, Savordem, Sarika Naik told TOI that students of her school struggle for internet connectivity. “Considering this problem, our teachers have now started visiting students’ homes to provide offline classes. Teachers give the students notes and correct their books, either at their homes or at any place in the village where they can gather. We don’t want any student to lag in their education,” she said. Teachers of Government High School, Sanvordem, and Government High School, Valpoi, have divided students into groups to be able to maintain social distancing. The teachers visit the interior villages, like Kumthol, Caranzol, Sonal and Sanvordem, and conduct classes at either the students’ homes or any place where they can gather safely. On Tuesday, they visited Sonal and conducted an offline class in the village temple hall. The efforts by these schools have been widely appreciated by parents and students. It will go a long way in ensuring that their children are not deprived of education either due to poor network connectivity or inability to afford the necessary devices, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sattari-teachers-forego-internet-work-from-students-home/articleshow/84217276.cms||Afaq Khan

The move comes weeks after the oxygen fiasco at the state’s premier healthcare facility left several Covid-19 patients dead. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the cabinet has granted approval for the proposal to enter an agreement with Taiyo Nippon Sanso for a long-term supply contract (five years) of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) at GMC, its super-speciality block, the South Goa district hospital, Margao, and the North Goa district hospital, Mapusa. After the tragedy in May, a decision was taken at the state executive meeting to install an LMO tank at GMC and the two district hospitals. Accordingly, the public health department explored the possibility of a long-term purchase with only four manufacturers — Inox India, Mumbai, Kolhapur oxygen and acetylene, JSW steel and Taiyo Nippon Sanso India — since only these manufacturers provided liquid medical oxygen during the pandemic. The cabinet didn’t wish to depend entirely on one supplier, Praxair, as any disruption would affect the entire state’s oxygen supply. Thus, quotations were invited only from leading liquid medical oxygen manufacturers, who were given allocations by the Centre based on geographical location. “Praxair India, Bengaluru, was deliberately not considered for this agreement so as not to be dependent on only one supplier,” the cabinet note said. The cabinet also granted ex-facto approval and expenditure sanction for procurement of various materials to restore the state’s electrical distribution network damaged by Cyclone Tauktae.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabinet-approves-contract-with-new-oxygen-supplier/articleshow/84217304.cms||---

Undersecretary health Gautami Parmekar submitted to the high court that in view of declining number of active Covid cases, steady decline in the state’s positivity rate, and improved pandemic situation throughout the country, “normalcy has to be restored in the state of Goa”. In its application, the government stated that as on July 6 Goa had 1,957 active cases, positivity rate less than 5% and recovery rate at 97%, which is in stark contrast to the situation on May 6 when the high court passed the order. The government also stated that the positivity rate in the entire country has sharply declined and as on June 30 stands at 2.34% and was less than 5% for 23 consecutive days. The weekly positivity rate in the entire country on June 30 was 2.69% and recovery rate 96.92%. Stating that the expert committee at its fourth meeting on July 2 recommended permitting inbound travellers from other states and UTs holding authentic vaccination certificate with two doses completed prior to entry without a Covid testing report, the government submitted details of other states that are permitting the same. The state government on May 6 directed the administration to ensure that no persons are permitted entry into the state unless they possess a negativity certificate obtained within 72 hours from the time they seek entry into the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/allow-fully-vaccinated-to-enter-without-certificate-state-to-hc/articleshow/84217363.cms||Lisa Monteiro

The case positivity rate dropped to 3.8%, while the recovery rate was steady at 97%. With three deaths, the mortality touched 3,083. Three men – a 66-year-old from Bicholim, a 74-year-old from Narve and a 64-year-old from Pernem, having comorbidities, died. As many as 22 patients were hospitalised, while three were discharged. Health centres in South Goa continue to report more cases than in North Goa. Margao, Cortalim and Ponda’s caseload was over 100. Baring Canacona, Shiroda, Balli, Chinchinim, Marcaim and Navelim, other centres had cases in the range of 80 to 90. The active case tally of all centres in North Goa has been less than 100 with Casarvarnem having the least number of cases. Though cases have declined, with the fear of the potential third wave lingering, doctors said people need to be careful. The state is yet to be fully vaccinated. The government has set a target to vaccinate the entire eligible population by the end of this month. Over 7.30 lakh people have received their first dose and little over 1.45 lakh have been fully vaccinated. On Wednesday, 15,411 people were vaccinated. Since last month, after the drive was thrown open to the 18-44 age group, the daily average vaccinations have increased. Earlier it would remain way below 10,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/positivity-rate-down-to-3-8-recovery-at-97/articleshow/84217460.cms||---

The number of Gujarat MPs in the Modi government has now increased from four to seven, making this perhaps the biggest number in a Union cabinet in the state’s political history. Until now, two Gujarat MPs – Amit Shah and S Jaishankar (he is RS MP from the state although he is not from Gujarat) – were cabinet ministers while Mansukh Mandaviya and Parshottam Rupala were junior ministers. On Wednesday, Mandaviya and Rupala were elevated to the cabinet rank while three new faces - Darshana Jardosh, Mahendra Mujapara and Devusinh Chauhan – were inducted as junior ministers. The cabinet reshuffle reflects an attempt to strike a balance between castes, communities and regions in the state ahead of next year’s assembly elections. Mandaviya is a Leuva Patel leader, Rupala from the Kadva Patel community (both from Saurashtra), Mahendra Munjapara represents the OBC Koli community of Saurashtra, Devusinh Chauhan belongs to the OBC Thakor community of central Gujarat and Darshana Jardosh is a Brahmin from south Gujarat whose husband belongs to the OBC. A senior BJP leader said, “The state has not got such a representation in any Union government since 1960. The Prime Minister and seven ministers in the Union cabinet are now from Gujarat.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/big-boost-to-gujarat-ahead-of-2022-polls/articleshow/84222496.cms||Kapil Dave

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Vaccination apps come in handy to book your shot||LUCKNOW: With more people getting vaccinated every day, it has become difficult to find slots on the state run CoWin app. Now, many apps and chat boxes have come up to help citizens find nearest vaccination centres and vacant slots. One such app available on Android is ‘Vaccinate Me’ which is being used by a number of people in the city. The app starts telling about the available slots and hospitals as soon as the user puts in the required information such as pin code, state, age group and vaccine in it. Another app Vaccine finder helps to book Covid vaccination slots in India. If the slots are unavailable, the app takes the user’s email and notifies via mail once the slot becomes available. “I’ve been trying to book the first dose for my parents. Finding a suitable slot was getting tough since within seconds they were getting booked. Finally, I found one through the app. The best part is the app shows you current statistics of Covid vaccination,” said Pragya Varma, a resident of LDA Colony. A chatbot has also been set up by the government in collaboration with WhatsApp for citizens to find the vaccination booths. Citizens only need to add the number 9013151515 to their contacts. Send ‘namaste’ as a whatsApp message to the given number. Once that is done, the chatbot will guide you to find your nearest centre. “Server hampers flow while booking a slot on CoWin. However, the chatbot works without any hindrance,” said Nikhil Katyal, who booked his second dose of vaccination on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-vaccination-apps-come-in-handy-to-book-your-shot/articleshow/84222561.cms||Aditi Singh

The blaze sent up giant orange flames on a vessel at the crucial Jebel Ali Port, the busiest in the Middle East that sits on the eastern side of the Arabian Peninsula. The combustion unleashed a shock wave through the skyscraper-studded city of Dubai, causing walls and windows to shake in neighborhoods as far as 25 kilometers (15 miles) away from the port. Panicked residents filmed from their high-rises as a fiery ball illuminated the night sky. The blast was powerful enough to be seen from space by satellite. There were no immediate reports of casualties at the port, which is also the busiest port of call for American warships outside the U.S. Some 2 1/2 hours after the blast, Dubai's civil defense teams said they had brought the fire under control and started the ``cooling process.'' Authorities posted footage on social media of firefighters dousing giant shipping containers. The glow of the blaze remained visible in the background as civil defense crews worked to contain the fire. The extent of damage caused to the sprawling port and surrounding cargo was not immediately clear. Footage shared on social media of the aftermath showed charred containers, ashes and littered debris. The sheer force and visibility of the explosion suggested the presence of a highly combustible substance. A Dubai authorities told the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya TV that the crew had evacuated in time and that the fire appeared to have started in one of the containers holding ``flammable material,'' without elaborating. Seeking to downplay the explosion, Mona al-Marri, director general of Dubai Media Office, told Al-Arabiya the incident ``could happen anywhere in the world'' and that authorities were investigating the cause. The Jebel Ali Port at the northern end of Dubai is the largest man-made deep-water harbor in the world and serves cargo from the Indian subcontinent, Africa and Asia. The port is not only a critical global cargo hub, but a lifeline for Dubai and surrounding emirates, serving as the point of entry for essential imports. Dubai authorities did not identify the stricken ship beyond saying it was a small vessel with a capacity of 130 containers. Ship tracker MarineTraffic showed a fleet of small support vessels surrounding a docked container ship called the Ocean Trader flagged in Comoros. Footage from the scene rebroadcast by the UAE's state-run WAM news agency showed firefighters hosing down a vessel bearing paint and logo that corresponds to the Ocean Trader, operated by the Dubai-based Inzu Ship Charter. The Ocean Trader docked at Jebel Ali Port at midday Wednesday. Ship tracking data showed the vessel had been sailing up and down the coast of the UAE since April. The United Nations ship database identified the vessel's owners as Sash Shipping corporation. Sash and Inzu Ship Charter did not immediately respond to request for comment. Operated by the Dubai-based DP World, Jebel Ali Port boasts a handling capacity of over 22 million containers and sprawling terminals that can berth some of the world's largest ships. Port officials said they were ``taking all necessary measures to ensure that the normal movement of vessels continues without any disruption.`` State-owned DP World describes Jebel Ali Port as a ``gateway hub'' and a ``vital link in the global trade network'' that connects eastern and western markets. The company did not immediately respond to request for comment on the blast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/fiery-explosion-erupts-on-ship-at-major-global-port-in-dubai/articleshow/84222572.cms||---

Petrol price in the national capital and Kolkata crossed Rs 100 after the 36th increase since May 4. On May 29, the country’s financial capital, Mumbai, earned the dubious distinction of becoming the first metro to see petrol selling for Rs 100 a litre. Chennai was next to see the fuel hit a century on July 2. Petrol sold for Rs 100 for the first time in the country in Rajasthan’s Sri Ganganagar district on February 17. After the latest price revision, petrol price now tops Rs 100 in 13 states. TOI had on February 25 first reported that Rs 100 could be the new normal for petrol. Diesel price has also risen above Rs 90 a litre in most parts of the country and crossed Rs 100 in parts of Rajasthan, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh. The record prices are being attributed to the rally in oil prices since January as crude is a factor in the pricing of fuels. Crude purchase cost rises from $55 in Jan to $77The rally has jacked up India’s crude purchase cost from $55 a barrel in January to $77 in the current week. As a result, the ‘base price’, or the price refiners charge dealers, of petrol in Delhi – the reference market with moderate fuel tax – has increased from Rs 28.50 a litre in the second fortnight of January to Rs 39.29 currently. The base price of diesel has risen from Rs 29.53 a litre to Rs 41.74 during this period. The consumer price of petrol has, however, jumped from Rs 84.70 a litre on January 16 to Rs 100.21 and diesel from Rs 74.88 per litre to Rs 89.18 during the period. This is because taxes levied by the Centre and states dictate the consumer prices, even though petrol and diesel rates are set according to their international quotes and the rupee-dollar exchange rate. Consumers in states with higher taxes end up paying more on the same base price. The Centre raised excise duty by Rs 13 on petrol and Rs 16 on diesel when oil prices collapsed between March-end and May due to the pandemic. This pushed up excise duty on petrol from Rs 19.98 a litre to Rs 32.98 and from Rs 15.83 to Rs 31.83. States, including Delhi, also jacked up VAT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/petrol-price-crosses-rs-100/litre-in-delhi-all-4-metros-in-league-of-centurions/articleshow/84224993.cms||Sanjay Dutta

This pushed up excise duty on petrol from Rs 19.98 a litre to Rs 32.98 and from Rs 15.83 to Rs 31.83.

---||Kolkata||Petrol price crosses Rs 100/litre in Delhi; all 4 metros in league of centurions||NEW DELHI: Regular petrol now costs Rs 100-plus per litre in all four metros, with Delhi and Kolkata joining the league of centurions on Wednesday as high taxes continued to amp up the impact of rising oil prices in the international market. Petrol price in the national capital and Kolkata crossed Rs 100 after the 36th increase since May 4. On May 29, the country’s financial capital, Mumbai, earned the dubious distinction of becoming the first metro to see petrol selling for Rs 100 a litre. Chennai was next to see the fuel hit a century on July 2. Petrol sold for Rs 100 for the first time in the country in Rajasthan’s Sri Ganganagar district on February 17. After the latest price revision, petrol price now tops Rs 100 in 13 states. TOI had on February 25 first reported that Rs 100 could be the new normal for petrol. Diesel price has also risen above Rs 90 a litre in most parts of the country and crossed Rs 100 in parts of Rajasthan, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh. The record prices are being attributed to the rally in oil prices since January as crude is a factor in the pricing of fuels. Crude purchase cost rises from $55 in Jan to $77The rally has jacked up India’s crude purchase cost from $55 a barrel in January to $77 in the current week. As a result, the ‘base price’, or the price refiners charge dealers, of petrol in Delhi – the reference market with moderate fuel tax – has increased from Rs 28.50 a litre in the second fortnight of January to Rs 39.29 currently. The base price of diesel has risen from Rs 29.53 a litre to Rs 41.74 during this period. The consumer price of petrol has, however, jumped from Rs 84.70 a litre on January 16 to Rs 100.21 and diesel from Rs 74.88 per litre to Rs 89.18 during the period. This is because taxes levied by the Centre and states dictate the consumer prices, even though petrol and diesel rates are set according to their international quotes and the rupee-dollar exchange rate. Consumers in states with higher taxes end up paying more on the same base price. The Centre raised excise duty by Rs 13 on petrol and Rs 16 on diesel when oil prices collapsed between March-end and May due to the pandemic. This pushed up excise duty on petrol from Rs 19.98 a litre to Rs 32.98 and from Rs 15.83 to Rs 31.83. States, including Delhi, also jacked up VAT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/petrol-price-crosses-rs-100/litre-in-delhi-all-4-metros-in-league-of-centurions/articleshow/84225001.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||Lucknow||Terai’s Ajay Mishra lone upper caste face from Uttar Pradesh in cabinet caste matrix||LUCKNOW: At a time when the UP assembly elections are just nine months away, BJP put its best foot forward by an OBC and dalit outreach in the Union cabinet expansion effected on Wednesday. The BJP included two Kurmis -- Anupriya Patel and Pankaj Chaudhary, and one Lodh --BL Verma -- from OBC in the newly recast cabinet. Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ is the only representative from the upper caste. The inclusion of Apna Dal chief and two-time Mirzapur MP Patel, an NDA alliance partner and Maharajganj’s BJP MP Pankaj Chaudhary, is being seen as the party’s attempt to win over dominant Kurmis when opposition parties, too, are making efforts to make a dent in the saffron party's OBC citadel. This caste has maximum presence in the region represented by Patel and Chaudhary. Their inclusion is also being seen as the BJP’s bid to make-up for the ouster of prominent Kurmi leader from the cabinet -- Sanotsh Gangwar, eight-time Bareilly MP who was asked to resign. After the exit of former CM Kalyan Singh from mainstream politics and former Jhansi MP Uma Bharti becoming inactive, the party think-tank was desperate to create a strong Lodh leadership. Hence the party has put a bet on Kalyan Singh’s old loyalist BL Verma, instead of his son Rajveer Singh. Verma has shown leadership quality at least on two occasions. Once when he was made the Rashtriya Kranti Party state chief when Kalyan left BJP to form his own outfit and secondly when the BJP made him president of Bareilly-Rohilkhand region after he came back to the party. Likewise, the ministerial berths have been evenly distributed among the dalit subcastes. Mohanlalganj MP Kaushal Kishore is a Pasi; Jalaun MP Bhanu Pratap Verma, a Kori and Agra MP SP Singh Baghel is a Pal. Political analysts see this as a larger strategy to stop Mayawati from regaining the lost non-Jatav vote bank among dalits. Baghel is a six-term MP from Agra reserve constituency after resigning from cabinet minister’s post in Yogi Government. Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ is the only representative from the upper caste among seven MPs inducted in the Modi cabinet. While it's being seen as the party’s bid to mollify Brahmins in the run-up to Vidhan Sabha election, the BJP has also tried to maintain a balancing act in the Terai region and showing inclination towards the party cadre after former Congress stalwart Jitin Prasad, also from the same region, joined the BJP a month back. Besides, the shift of another Brahmin MP Mahendra Nath Pandey, from skill development & entrepreneurship to heavy industries is also being viewed as an elevation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/terais-ajay-mishra-lone-upper-caste-face-from-uttar-pradesh-in-cabinet-caste-matrix/articleshow/84222606.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

---||Kolkata||Two days after three-digit debut, petrol scores all-Kolkata century||KOLKATA: The price of a litre of petrol breached the 100-rupee mark at all fuel stations across Kolkata on Wednesday, barely 48 hours since it had touched three digits at two fuel pumps, for the first time ever. And with diesel, too, selling over the 90-rupee mark, it is being feared that it won’t be too long before this, too, “scores a century”. The current selling price, Rs 100.23, follows a 39-paisa increase in two days, the 36th time in two months. It’s also a 37% hike since June 2020, when it was priced Rs 73.28, which is the highest increase in fuel prices ever over a 13-month period. Diesel, the backbone of commercial vehicles, is currently selling for Rs 92.50. This, a 41% increase since June 2020 (when it was priced at Rs 65.61), is an even bigger leap. If the trend continues, this, too, would cross the 100-rupee mark in the not-too-distant future, believe fuel station owners. As a mark of protest, petrol pumps across the state affiliated with the association refrained from selling fuel between 7pm and 7.30pm on Wednesday. “This is a dark day in the history of the petroleum business in our city,” said Snehasis Bhowmik, vice-president, West Bengal Petroleum Dealers’ Association. “The cost of fuel has risen around Rs 30 since last year and according to information we have, it will continue to rise in the coming days. While petrol pump operators like us get only a minuscule commission of Rs 2.80 per litre, the majority of the money goes into taxes. We request the central and state governments to take immediate steps in controlling this price-rise, which is affecting every citizen.” According to officials of oil marketing companies, fuel prices in the country have been rising almost every alternate day since last month due to a hike in international crude oil prices, which rose sharply in 2021 on the back of a resurgence in global demand as the world economy slowly recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic. The price of Brent crude has risen by 47.1% to about $76.20 per barrel from about $51.80 per barrel at the beginning of the year. Sources in an oil PSU said it may take some time before domestic petrol and diesel prices get reduced — or until the government takes a call on lowering fuel taxes. High central and state taxes on petrol and diesel are the primary reasons behind spiralling fuel prices in Bengal. Till Tuesday, the central tax was Rs 32.90 (around 63% of total taxes on petrol in state), while the state tax was Rs 19.27. Similarly, on diesel, the central tax is Rs 31.80 and the state tax Rs 13.08. The base price of petrol in the city was only Rs 44.20 while that of diesel was Rs 45.16 on July 6. Apart from taxes and the base price, the rest of the price components include freight charges and dealers’ commission of around Rs 2.80. The state government had reduced the taxes on petrol and diesel by Re 1 on February 22 for four months, which has already been renewed for another three months through a notification. The total demand for petrol in the state is around 1.2 lakh kilo litres (kl) per month, while that of diesel is around 3 lakh kl. Motorists were left feeling the pinch. “I can’t believe that we cannot even get a litre of petrol for Rs 100 now,” said Tala Park resident Abhishek Banerjee. “I had bought a car two years back hoping for comfortable travel to and from office. But now I am prepared to keep my car in the garage and return to public transport.” The spiralling diesel price has also kept several buses and cabs off the roads, even after the Covid-induced restrictions were relaxed last week. “With diesel inching fast towards Rs 100, there is no point operating a bus unless the government increases bus fares,” said Saikat Das, who owns two private buses on the Howrah-Pailan route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/two-days-after-three-digit-debut-petrol-scores-all-kolkata-century/articleshow/84219519.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Devul is son of Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (RSP) leader Ghanshyam Fulbaze who had contested the civic polls earlier this year. “His blood tests didn’t reveal the presence of alcohol. But we have sent the samples for forensic tests. CCTV footage shows that he was driving the jeep alone,” said assistant commissioner of police (ACP) SB Kumpavat. The cops suspected that he may have been drunk while driving his jeep on the fateful evening on July 3. The victim Kavish Patel was returning home on two-wheeler with his elder sister Dharvi Patel and brother Kiyan when Devul’s jeep hit their vehicle near the crematorium road in Manjalpur. Kavish suffered severe injuries and died during the treatment in the hospital. Devul fled but he had to abandon the vehicle near Alwa Naka after it rammed into a divider. Cops later found the jeep and tracked down Devul’s father Ghanshyam Fulbaze. Ghanshyam told them that his son Devul drove the jeep that didn’t carry license plate. Devul surrendered before the Manjalpur police on Monday. Devul told the cops that he had studied till 12th standard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/netas-son-who-mowed-down-7-year-old-kid-granted-bail/articleshow/84214434.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal cash transfers OK if focus on growth, says BJP MLA Ashok Lahiri||KOLKATA: Economist and BJP MLA Ashok Lahiri felt the Bengal budget lacked “balance” and was also unsure of the success of the cash transfers because there had been no performance audit on these programmes till date. “I do not mind if the state wants to stimulate demand by injecting cash among targeted sections. But there has to be a balance. It has to go in tandem with the state’s development plan. It is evident from the state’s annual financial statement how capital expenditure has taken a hit in all these days. The capital expenditure has come down to a low Rs 14,518.11 crore in the 2020-21 revised estimates when the budgetary allocation was Rs 31,047 crore in the same fiscal,” Lahiri said. The BJP MLA, who had served as chief economic adviser to the Government of India, also pointed to the state’s increasing debt burden. “The state’s total debt outstanding is Rs 3,36,757 crore till March 2021 and is projected to increase by another Rs 1,15,672 crore in the 2021-22 fiscal. There is hardly any point comparing the state’s burgeoning debt burden and debt to GSDP ratio with that of the Centre because the Centre is in control of the monetary authorities which states don’t. And the debt to GSDP ratio is not the only parameter to examine financial management. We should also consider the debt to income ratio,” Lahiri said. The economist said such cash transfers worked well in bigger economies. “They often do not work in small economies like that of a province. On the contrary, smaller economies spill out,” he said. The BJP MLA then set aside numbers and figures and urged focus on the exodus of labourers and skilled persons from the state. “If everything was fine, these people wouldn’t have left the state looking for jobs elsewhere,” he said. Lahiri was not opposed to giving cash stimulus as long as it reached targeted sections. “The state government has been running centrally sponsored schemes and also some it claims to be its own. How do we know that the money is reaching the beneficiaries? Has there been any performance audit on these schemes being run in Bengal. If so, where is the report?” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-cash-transfers-ok-if-focus-on-growth-lahiri/articleshow/84219300.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: NHRC teams visit Malda, Nandigram on violence probe||NANDIGRAM/MALDA: A three-member National Human Rights Commission team visited Nandigram on Wednesday to record complaints of post-poll violence in Bengal. They first went to Kendamari and then held a formal hearing at the Nandigram-1 Block community hall. People claimed that a group of around 35 masked men had ransacked their village. “You can read and write, why didn’t you lodge a police complaint?” an NHRC committee member said to a woman. “What does the government keep police for?” While most Trinamool leaders chose not to speak, the party’s Nandigram-1 Block president Swadesh Das said: “BJP has led a very poisonous and divisive campaign in Nandigram. They are still fanning trouble. Post-elections, there have been some isolated incidents against workers of both parties. Police are looking into it.” Local BJP leader Pralay Pal said: “The people’s mandate in Nandigram will not be suppressed. We will take our complaints to the NHRC.” Another NHRC team taking complaints in Kenbona village waded into controversy when it was found accompanied by a local BJP leader. Trinamool district leader Prosenjit Das said: “One BJP leader was with the NHRC team.” Although they denied the allegation, BJP’s Milan Das himself conceded: “I had taken them to our workers’ houses as per the party’s direction.” The team was led by NHRC vice-chairperson Atif Rasheed. They spoke to Gangaram Mandal, a BJP worker, who was allegedly tortured after the elections. Rasheed told reporters: “We have tried to understand the situation. They are still scared and fear torture after we leave.” TMC leader Das said: “There was no post-poll violence at all in Malda. Rather, in some places our workers were assaulted by BJP goons. NHRC never cared about them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nhrc-teams-visit-malda-nandigram-on-violence-probe/articleshow/84219616.cms||Suman Mandal
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Actor Tanusree Chakraborty quits BJP, says ‘no regrets’||KOLKATA: Actor Tanusree Chakraborty, who had contested the Bengal assembly polls on a BJP ticket from Shyampur, has quit the party to concentrate full-time on her film career. Soon after her exit, she said the draft changes to the Cinematograph Act were not in the interest of cinema. “The government had asked for feedback on the proposed amendments. I believe the amendment allowing certified films to be recalled is not pro-cinema,” she said. On why she decided to quit politics, Chakraborty said: “I want to be free of any political colour. One has to study more to be in politics. However, I don’t regret what I did. Contesting too was a learning process for me.” Does she regret her political speeches during her campaign? “In retrospect, we often wonder if we would have acted differently had the same thing happened now. But, I have no regrets about joining or quitting politics. One doesn’t need to join politics to serve the people,” she said. Many celebrities within the BJP had been against the actor’s poll nomination. They had claimed she wouldn’t stick with the party for long. “I never lusted for power. I still want to do my bit for the people, but without any party stamp... I would prefer getting a ticket not because of my celebrity status, but for the work I have done,” she said. Actor-turned-BJP worker Rupa Bhattacharjee told TOI that Chakraborty’s political decisions would not alter their “friendship”. “Any person can join or quit politics. It’s good that she has quickly understood that politics is not for her. I respect her honesty in admitting so,” Bhattacharjee said. Bhattacharjee, however, questioned why the party gave tickets to newcomers and ignored the likes of Suman Banerjee and Sarbari Mukherjee. “They have been working for the party all along and were still ignored. It’s much more relevant to question how a regimented party like BJP accepted such a system of nomination,” she said. Suman Banerjee, the cultural convener of Bengal BJP, said while some were lucky in politics, it was not a space that encouraged the likes of “one-film wonders”. “You cannot just walk in and become a leader. You need to give it time. Those who thought they’ll come, spend a few months and then become MLAs/MPs are so wrong. Now, they are moving away because their dreams have been dashed. This, though, will not impact a party like BJP,” he said. The actor was not given a BJP ticket despite joining the party in 2012. “It’s time for the party to think seriously before deciding on who to nominate for elections,” he added. Actor-turned-BJP worker Anindya Pulak Banerjee said he was not surprised over the turn of events. “I don’t know if those who joined BJP just before the elections, got nominated, contested and then lost were ever serious about politics. They saw some interest in joining a party. That interest could be monetary or a desire to enjoy power. I doubt if they joined after understanding the ideals of BJP. I wouldn’t be surprised if more such people suddenly realise that politics is not their cup of tea. Politics was glamour for them. They are all confused and suffering from political disillusionment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/actor-tanusree-quits-bjp-says-no-regrets/articleshow/84219405.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Rejig may help BJP, not people, says chief minister Mamata Banarjee||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said 2024 was a lost case, reacting to the Union cabinet reshuffle. Saying it would not impact people, Banerjee said the only thing BJP was serious about was politics. Taking a jibe at Narendra Modi, the CM said people would listen only if petrol, diesel, vaccine and PM-Cares figure in the Prime Minister’s monthly radio talk ‘Mann Ki Baat’. She also said a cabinet reshuffle would be of little relief to people whose kitchens are on fire due to fuel and LPG price hike. On Bengal inductees in the Union cabinet, particularly Alipurduar MP John Barla whose “separate north Bengal state” comment had evoked sharp reactions, Banerjee said: “During destruction, in despair people look for such people. This may satisfy their party, but people will not gain anything. And BJP, not today, but always has been a separatist party itself.” “I can’t say much on the cabinet reshuffle,” she continued. “It is their internal matter, their prerogative. Whom they will make ministers, whom they will shove away, it is their matter. Now Babul (Asansol MP Babul Supriyo) has become bad. A Rajbonshi woman MP (Debasree Chaudhuri) has also become bad. The people they are promoting now will be of no help to people.” Asked about Union health minister and minister of state for health’s resignations, the CM said: “What is the point in victimising the health minister? The PM oversaw everything. He held all meetings. And do you believe BJP was ever serious about Covid? They were only serious about politics.” She added: “Even now, they are giving vaccines like releasing kite strings, slowly and staggered. We had asked for 3 crore vaccines long ago. Other states have got it, we haven’t.” Reacting sharply to fuel price hike, Banerjee said: “My reaction is very bitter on this. It isn’t just petrol or diesel; kitchens are on fire. Household expenses have shot up. Does he (PM) think about it (fuel price hike) or believe a cabinet reshuffle will solve this?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-rejig-may-help-bjp-not-people/articleshow/84219375.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal 4 in cabinet, BJP focus on state||KOLKATA: Four fresh faces from West Bengal made it to the Union cabinet in the reshuffle on Wednesday, sending indications that BJP hadn’t lost focus on the state. BJP’s Cooch Behar MP Nisith Pramanik, Alipurduar MP John Barla, Bankura MP Subhas Sarkar and Bongaon MP and Matua leader Shantanu Thakur will be junior ministers. Incumbent junior ministers Babul Supriyo and Debasree Chaudhuri resigned from the cabinet to make way for the new entrants. In effect, there have been two more additions this time after BJP’s poor show in the Bengal assembly polls when only two were inducted into the Union cabinet after the party’s impressive performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The induction process bears out that BJP stands committed to consolidating its support bases in north Bengal, Jangalmahal and the Matua belt in North 24 Parganas by roping in Rajbanshis, Namasudras, Paliyas and Adivasis mainly working in farmlands and tea gardens rather than picking up faces from south Bengal, where the party didn’t perform well in assembly polls. The BJP is ahead of Trinamool among these sections as is evident from the results in Cooch Behar, Alipurduar, Bankura and Bongaon. Outgoing Union minister Supriyo let the party have its way. He made amends to his “asked to resign” Facebook comment and said on social media: “Yes, I have resigned from the Council of Ministers. As I had framed it earlier, ‘Asked to resign’ may not be the right way to put it.” “I am extremely happy that I go today without a spot of corruption on me,” he added. Debasree Chaudhuri, the other outgoing Union minister, had no angst. She rose from the ranks and was BJP observer for the party’s Kolkata unit. BJP sources said Debasree would be back to organization work. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh didn’t read much into the reshuffle. “It’s nothing special. People become ministers and after some time, they are back to serve the organization. Those who joined this party as a launching pad to power are not aware of this. When they get upset, they speak out, ignoring party discipline,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-4-in-cabinet-bjp-focus-on-state/articleshow/84219279.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Focus on social sector, agriculture in pandemic-year budget||KOLKATA: In its first budget after returning to office, the Mamata Banerjee government has stuck to the economic mantra of injecting cash at the grassroots to stimulate demand so that increased spending leads to a supply-side boost. Accordingly, much of the government spending — 84.5% of the state budgetary outlay of Rs 3,08,727 crore — is focused on social sector and agriculture. The Rs 18,650 crore increase in the budgetary outlay over last year has been entirely used to fund people-oriented schemes like the Lakshmir Bhandar, a basic monthly income plan for women heads of families, the new Krishak Bandhu for farmers, Duare Ration, student credit card, Swasthya Sathi besides allocations for Covid management, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Wednesday. Her government has allocated Rs 10,000 crore alone for the Lakshmir Bhandar scheme. Beside, to boost demand in the real estate sector, stamp duty on registration has been reduced to 4% from the existing 6% for property below Rs 1 crore and circle rate or market value slashed by 10%. For the transport sector that is reeling under increased operating costs due to spiralling fuel prices, the waiver on road tax for commercial passenger vehicles has been extended till December 31; earlier the waiver was till June 30, 2021. Taken together, these “demand stimulus” is estimated at Rs 15,650 crore and leaves the government with a limited budget deficit of Rs 7 crore. The government’s efforts to boost demand has also helped the state retain a positive growth rate — GSDP 1.2% — when the Centre has registered a negative GDP growth rate of -7.7%. Based on the positive growth rate, the government has pegged its own revenue generation at Rs 75,415 crore for 2021-2022 despite the ongoing pandemic as against Rs 60,609 crore in 2020-2021. “When the entire world is following the model of stimulating demand, the Centre is taking the reverse route of trying to boost the supply side by releasing loans. It also gave a 10% corporate tax relief to big businesses hoping that they will invest more. It didn’t work because the corporates don’t have confidence in the government,” said finance minister Amit Mitra. The increased public spending to boost demand and to protect the state plan, however, is causing considerable stress on the state coffers. The state’s total debt outstanding of Rs 3,36,757crore till March 2021 is projected to increase by Rs 1,15,672crore in the 2021-22 fiscal while the annual outgo on debt serving is estimated at Rs 61,042 crore as against Rs 44,289crore last year. The FM pointed out that the state’s debt to GSDP ratio is 35.54% when the Centre’s debt to GDP ratio stands at 62.22%. Mitra also pointed out how the Centre had increased cess on commodities over the years even after the country’s tax regime switched to GST. “Under the GST regime, 42% of the tax collected goes to the states. But this doesn’t apply for cess. Money mopped up as cess goes entirely to the Centre. The Centre has consistently increased the cess component over the years from 6% to 11%,” he said. The CM later provided the political reason behind the stress on state finances. “We have been denied our dues in terms of devolution of tax shares and grants which is a constitutional provision. The Centre deprived us of Rs 25,225 crore in two financials. The state got Rs 14,225 crore less than the Rs 58,952.55 crore mentioned in the Union Budget in 20-21. We also got Rs 11,000 crore less in the year before that. These are apart from the Rs 33,314 crore that the Centre owes to the state with regard to centrally sponsored schemes,” Banerjee said after placing the budget in the Assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/focus-on-social-sector-agri-in-pandemic-year-budget/articleshow/84219356.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Calcutta high court judge recuses from Nandigram case, fines Mamata Banerjee Rs 5 lakh||KOLKATA: Calcutta High Court judge Kausik Chanda on Wednesday recused himself from hearing Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s petition on BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari’s Nandigram poll victory but also fined her Rs 5 lakh to “firmly repulse” the “calculated psychological offensives and vilification adopted to seek recusal”. CM Banerjee had alleged in her petition that Justice Chanda’s long association with the BJP’s legal cell and taking up cases for the party posed an “apprehension of bias” and that “the court should be like Caesar’s wife, above suspicion”. Justice Chanda said he had “no personal inclination to hear out the case” nor did he have any “hesitation in taking up the case” but he still chose to recuse because “the two persons involved in this case belong to the highest echelons of state politics”. “Some opportunists have already emerged... in the name of saving the judiciary. These trouble-mongers will try to keep the controversy alive and create newer controversies. The trial of the case before this bench will be a tool to aggrandise themselves. It would be contrary to the interest of justice if such unwarranted squabble continues along with the trial,” the judge said. The fine of Rs 5 lakh should be paid to the Bar Council of West Bengal to help families of advocates who lost their lives to Covid, he ordered. CM Banerjee did not respond to the fine. “This is a sub-judice matter. I will not speak on this. The lawyers will take a decision,” she said. But other Trinamool leaders as well as the BJP’s IT Cell chief took to Twitter after the order. Trinamool Rajya Sabha leader and spokesperson Derek O’Brien, without directly referring to the judgement, tweeted: “We live and learn. We live in a world where the cost of speaking the truth now comes with a staggering price tag: Rs 5 lakh. We live in a world where propaganda and falsehood are also meted out. The price: FREE. Got the reference? Modi hai to mumkin Hai. Go figure.” Trinamool Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra, whose tweet listing the cases Justice Chanda had appeared for the BJP as a lawyer was mentioned in Justice Chanda’s order, tweeted: “Petulance at its best today. Realising no way out but to recuse himself he decides to slap ₹5lakh fine simply because he can. Kind of like teacher realises student is correct & breaks blackboard.” BJP leader Amit Malviya, however, felt the fine was “a small sum”. “The fine on Banerjee for showing the judiciary in poor light is a small sum, given the potential of her actions and utterances to cause erosion of trust of the common man in our institutions. She had similarly maligned EC during elections,” he tweeted. Justice Chanda said in his order that he did not agree with the CM’s petition that his “long, close, personal, professional, pecuniary and ideological relationship” with a political party posed a “conflict of interest”. “It is almost impossible in this country to get a person who may not be said to have political views. Anyone interested in politics may be said to have an ‘interest’. Like any other citizen of the country, a judge too exercises voting rights in favour of a political party but lays aside individual predilections while deciding a case,” he said. “The past association of a judge with a political party by itself cannot form apprehension of bias. This proposition, if allowed to be accepted, would be destructive to the deep-rooted notion of neutrality associated with the justice delivery system and lead to the unfair practice of bench-hunting,” the judge wrote in his order. Justice Chanda also referred to CM Banerjee’s apprehension of bias since she had objected to his confirmation as a permanent judge of the Calcutta HC. “The petitioner cannot seek recusal based on her own consent or objection with regard to the appointment of a judge. A judge cannot be said to be biased because of a litigant’s perception and action. It is ludicrous to believe that the petitioner would expect a favourable order from a judge whose appointment she had consented to and vice-versa,” the order said. He was not aware that a letter had been written to the acting Chief Justice seeking reassignment of the case when he first took up its hearing on June 18, Justice Chanda said, adding: “The script was already prepared; the dramatis personae were ready to launch a well-rehearsed drama outside court.” He then went on to cite Trinamool MPs Derek O’Brien and Mahua Moitra’s tweets. The “chronology of the events” suggested “that a deliberate and conscious attempt was made to influence my decision before the recusal application was placed before me for judicial consideration on June 24,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cal-hc-judge-recuses-from-nandi-case-fines-cm-rs-5-lakh/articleshow/84219260.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

They should be released. Especially the elderly and aged persons.” On the appointment of new governors, she said: “They did not heed my letters. All governors have been changed, barring Bengal and Kerala. Why? And even if they have not been changed, they should be asked to abide by the Constitution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didi-sees-political-victimisation/articleshow/84219506.cms||---
